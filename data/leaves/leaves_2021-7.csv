I smoked for the last year like three times a week and the last 6 month everyday. It‘s not that long, but I just came to the realisation, that my fire for so many things I loved, stopped. 
It was at this point were I put weed over going to the gym, growing my business or spend time with my loved ones. I am 72hours sober now and threw away all my stuff. I am not having hard cravings to smoke, but insane problems with sleeping. And the sleep depervation brings the need to smoke in my brain. 

Any advice on how to handle this? I am just not tired at all. Laying in bed, sun rising… Just ignore it and get up and sleep when I am tired even tho its during the day? During the week this will be a nightmare… someone here had the same problems?

it feels like I'm in a marathon that won't end. in the first week I was super excited, proud of myself that the physical withdrawals were gone. Then the next 2 weeks I Was like whoa! I feel excited about fixing my life, and I feel slightly more motivation to clean. Then after 4 weeks, I realized that I am just overwhelmingly constantly depressed unless I am crushing on a girl, or I am in a semblance of a relationship (never been in one), and it's not fair to use love or a girl as a natural high to replace my emptiness and laziness. Could it be something related to a dopamine dysfunction? I only feel like doing things for a girl, or waste time on addicting tv shows instead of doing what I need to do to fix my life (questionable if it's even fixable, or if I would attain happiness if i did). At this point, I feel like I""m giving it one more year, and to improve my life skills as much as possible before I give up and fall back in, if I don't find a girl to keep me high and in love. Come to think of it, I've always been depressed and irritable since grade school. Could weed have just been something to mask my personal problems, which are unfixable? 

Anyone else dealing with difficult times like me? I haven't been sober for 13 years and this time I've had the most resolve, and even looking forward to the more free time I get by not just being stoned and lost in thought and doing simple things high that I enjoyed, but it only lasted for like a week, now I am just overwhelmingly depressed, or just sitting there crying, feeling sad, and doing nothing. It doesn't feel like something that is going away. I feel like I was just born or had a messed up upbringing, and instead of needlessly suffering my entire life, is why i smoked, but now when I get high i get panic attacks and it doesn't feel as good as it used to anyway. I hope that any brain damage from this is recoverable. I've never been happy normal to be honest, I just feel like my same self 13 years ago, and I feel hopeless.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67940885}"

I never hear from them, and every time I call I get transferred to a voicemail, I leave a message and I never hear from anybody. 

I work for myself. I've been lucky, I've been able to worry about myself and not have to work, especially in this fucking heat we're having. That also means I don't have insurance, and I'm definitely not rich.

Anytime I infer about a therapist in my area or I actually contact a therapist, same deal. No return call, I know I don't have insurance and I know I don't have a lot of money but fuck it's very frustrating to find the help you need in this situation. 

Funny thing is most of the time any of these people I talk to, their first recommendation is to go to a substance abuse program. I tell them no, I have 5 years clean off other drugs, under my belt and I want to address the issues my marijuana use was covering up all these years.

Oh, also, I got four bills from the hospital for the one time I went for labs, CT scan, and meds (when I first started having my problems) $13,000 dollars before sliding pay scale, after that they still want $5400. 

It just makes me feel that there's no real help available for me. It comes down to as I'm a single male with no kids. I'm almost penalized for that. I just don't know where to turn, the state funded clinics aren't going to help. And I'm not mad at him I realize they got to work with with what they got to work with.

Week one had really bad chills and night sweats. It reminded me of that scene in walk hard where you need more blankets and less blankets at the same time! I felt very dehydrated and couldn’t get enough water. I also had to force myself to eat. Talk about brain fog and tiredness unlike ever before. Nettle tea helped, but wow it felt like such an intense withdrawal. I don’t know if anyone else experience major penis shrinkage but it seemed concerning. I had absolutely no libido. End of week one I used epsom salt baths which helped the night sweats. 

Week two and on came the fucking dreams. I mean dreams that were so terrifying and vivid that they honestly scared me awake! The dreams would leave me feeling extremely tired and out of whack, again the brain fog intensified, but it beat having night purging sweats. Depression was really intense. I listened to one sad song and had to leave work crying. The weight of any pain or conflict was too much and I felt myself go into moments of sadness to complete happiness. 

Week three was off and on vivid and intense dreams. No more penis shrinkage, everything feels great down there now. Libido is back and even better! I went to my first concert not high since I was 18! I have to say music is just as good live sober as it is high. The past few days I didn’t even think about weed, I have been eating really well and last night I got a solid 5 hours of uninterrupted, no dreams, black abyss type sleep. 

I am still taking it one step at a time, one day at a time. I have cravings here and there but it has become easier and easier to cope with those cravings.

I attribute that entirely to finally having figured out WHY I smoked weed. And for me, it was to numb myself. I finally understood the cause of my addiction. Once I realised that I want to know the real me, to be authentic and to realise whatever my true potential is my resolve hardened.

Week 1 and 2 were truly awful. I cried more in those weeks than in the last 5 years combined, it was nuts. Real emotions started to flood back, repressed memories and things I had been ignoring demanded attention. It was painful.

I got through it by talking a lot about how I was feeling. Coming here to this subreddit was a Godsend and helping others through their tough times gave me strength. I drank a tonne of water every day. I did hardcore cardio (long-distance running) every day which was the only thing that would make me feel good or at least not entirely like warmed up shit.

Slowly things got better. But it took a long time. I only started dreaming again at the end of week 3 and it was still very hazy. Now (almost the end of week 5) they're getting more vivid and enjoyable even.

Weeks 2-5 were characterised by waves of very mild withdrawal symptoms. And that, in some ways, was more tricky to deal with than the first two weeks. It wasn't harder but it was trickier. When you burst out crying for no reason and feel utterly terrible then it's easy to say to yourself ""Ohhh this is just withdrawal, let's go for a big run and get some endorphins pumping, eat some healthy food and then I'll feel better in a couple of hours or so, just ride out the wave"". But when it's subtle and nuanced it just feels like life isn't enjoyable, it feels hollow and boring and I just felt lethargic and melancholic. I'd need a lot more self-awareness to realise that that too was actually still just the withdrawal symptoms. 

With the removal of the cannabis ""everything is OK"" safety blanket life gets more demanding. You get bored and you need to actually deal with that. You need to build a sober life worth living and that can be hard. But it is SO worthwhile. I'm so glad I'm where I'm at right now. I'm scared of the future but I'm also very proud of myself for being the kind of person who can feel that fear and still have the courage to keep going. That self-respect is something I did not have as a stoner. 

It does get better. 

Quitting weed doesn't make life awesome but it does create the possibility to make life awesome.

 Weed was the cause and only guilty of all my problems, I couldn't do anything because of it. Well, all that was bullshit. The herb probably didn't help, but in these 3 weeks I didn't change a bit. My life is still the same, I hang with the same people, listen to the same music and overall I behave the same.

 Two things changed and those are very important aspects: I have more time, I have more money. I'm buying bricks one by one to build my house, I think in all the money I spent sleeping myself and it hurts to think that I could already have my house built. But what's done is done and I can't change it.

 In the mornings I have the extra time I needed to train my dog and take proper care of him, cook myself real food to take to work instead of eating hot dog and burgers (I work in a hot dog shop) out of laziness. I'm even finding time to train, which I don't because I'm lazy AF.

 And this last thing is what I wanted to share. Don't think quitting will magically make you energetic, ambitious and smart. That's in you. I haven't had a single urge in this 21 days, no one struggle. I didn't had insomnia (no more than I usually have, I'm a light sleeper), I didn't sweat at night, etc, etc. And this is coming from a 27yo who smokes since 15/16. 

 The only thing (personality-wise) that I can aknowledge is that I'm finally calm. I wanted to quit and I did. But I'm the same person, I just don't have anything to blame but myself now, and I hope that's going to help moving forward, but as of today, nothing has changed. I have one certainty though, I probably won't smoke again. Reality is just better for me.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4666663}"

In the new year I lost that job and took it up again as I had nothing else to do, skip on to recently I’ve been a daily smoker through that time but I’ve lost my interest in it or something of sort, a lot of the time I don’t smoke during the day but occasionally go in and out of spurts of day smoking. My tolerance has become really high again and weed numbs my emotions a bit and I mainly use it as a mean to sleep hence why I try not to day smoke. I recently decided to quit again as I had some of these feelings last time I quit. I’m 4 days in currently trying to sleep but I currently got this idea to post here so this post is actually keeping me up at the moment hahaha. Anyway I have had no issues this time maybe due to how I succeeded last time without any mistakes. I know I have good willpower but I have some questions...

When will my sleeping go back to normal?

And smoking is a big part of my friends lives but they are fully supportive, my goal is 2 weeks but that’s also a means to quit it just takes a couple weeks to start feeling better, I was just wondering if I were to have a very occasional toke with my friends as I enjoy the high with a low tolerance, will it bring some withdrawal symptoms back hence not sleeping, I strongly believe in my willpower to not get addicted again haven’t even had 1 craving but yeah will my body try to latch on again after a very occasional toke?

Another year has came and went. People say it gets easier. I don't know if I would agree. There's always obstacles we have to circumvent. This year was possibly the most difficult given the circumstances we all faced. I was lucky enough to be deemed expendable, so I wouldn't dare say I've had it as rough as some of you fellow leavers. Never during my 20+ years of heavy abuse did I imagine I'd be weed free for this long. Always joked with my buddies I wanted to be buried with a joint in my mouth and a handful of seeds in my coffin.

Recently I've been battling a very strong urge to use. I can't pinpoint why. It's not that I think I can use with a modicum of responsibility. I can't. I'm a go hard or go home type guy. Might be the upcoming cross country relocation my family is about to embark upon. Might be the sense of familiarity I had with the tweeds for so long, our safety blankie/wubby. Might be that I'm surrounded by it 24/7 in this legal environment. Whatever the reason I can't quiet that voice. I'm winning for the moment and have reverted back to staying clean one day at a time. I can honestly say posting this three year update has motivated me to stay the course these past few weeks.

I want anyone that is considering starting on this path to know it's possible to stop using. If I'm doing it you definitely can. I smoked all day every day. From my first waking moments until I exhaled my last bong rip when I went to bed. Every fucking second I was high. I didn't go for more than a day without for over 15 years. Never had any breaks. Never wanted to quit. July 27th 2018 was the day my life changed.

My now best friend sent me a private message, and pointed me in the right direction. It was so hard at first. I wanted to give up. I wanted to take the easy path. He discouraged that, and kept me afloat. Jason, if you read this you know how important your guidance has been to me. I'm doing the work but you're there to listen to my bullshit and stupidity when I need someone. Thank you. Also, thank you to the rest of you. Your stories continue to provide me with motivation. No matter if you're just starting or have been at this for extended periods of time they help me.

Everything has changed in my life. I get shit done now. I make things happen. I will keep making things happen. If you need some words of encouragement know that you can do the same. You get shit done. You make things happen. That sweet sweet plant sinks her hooks in deep. Be stronger than the plant. Beat that addict inside. Prove the doubters wrong.

I look forward to my Four year update. The changes I've made these past three years will be dwarved by what this year has in store for me. I'm always available if anyone needs to talk, vent, or just say some off the wall shit. Send me a PM. I'll respond as soon as I can. Might not say want you want to hear, but I promise I'll listen. I've been in your shoes. I've walked the walk. I owe a lot to r/leaves. It's my honor to pay it forward. Once again thank you all from the bottom of my heart. My fellow former stoner family and those thinking of joining truly mean the world to me. I wish you all luck in your future endeavors. Embrace the suck. Let's make shit happen together.",84,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43895796}"

Will I ever stop feeling like this? Completely unmotivated to do shit you gotta do.
The thing is, I have quit for almost a year in 2019 and have been on/of smoking since then. And it didn't get better.

I would just be cured and have no addiction and join in with the 'normal people - which hasn't been the case for me. Even though it DOES get easier the want will always be there. So is this a battle I'll be facing for the rest of my life?

I don't know though my life's pretty good in my eyes apart from money wise when I'm smoking. I have a lovely family lovely house ect. I smoked weed everyday since I was 15 - now 27. Maybe that's just it. It's been ingrained in my life for such a long time. Maybe that's just the price I have to pay for dancing with the devil. Sorry my post in a bit of a downer.

I don’t want to go back to smoking because I can’t stand the idea of putting my happiness in the hands of something else. If these last few months have taught me anything, it’s that I certainly don’t need to depend on anything else to be happy, but the thought of smoking again irks me because I feel like it’s admitting that another substance could make me happier. 

Basically I hate the thought that I can’t enjoy life as much as possible without relying on something else like weed. Even if I say, well, i’ve already proven that to myself so I can smoke again now, it feels like going back would be admitting that isn’t the case. It’s like, why use it again if you don’t need to. And if you truly have self control, you wouldn’t go back at all.

I was a keyboard player in early 20s and in a few local rock and soul cover bands. Up until about 20 I was purely a drinker, never touched any drugs and never felt the need to! Got so drunk most weekends that it woudnt have made much difference if I did smoke weed.

Then I started hanging out with a few musicians who smoked pot all the time. The sticky, brown very low THC stuff we get in Western Europe because nobody can grow weed indoors or outdoors at the time. Mixed with tobacco. I used to smoke every evening after work and spend hours round at friends houses just smoking and playing music etc. Same at weekends. The live music and band scene just goes hand in hand with drugs and weed was just like smoking ciggs, not ""hard"" like other drugs so just became so normalised that we were all wasted all the time, driving and working half baked.

I remember one other ""clean"" friend commenting how my thoughts and words started getting jumbled and he was a bit bummed that so many of us were so stoned all the time. I didnt really care. Looking back now I see how it affected so many relationships with friends and girlfriends, little fights became huge and my constant inner unhappiness with myself and my world was clearly made worse by the brain fog of poor quality pot.

I had a business at the time and it was a mess and didnt go very well, partly I'm sure due to being wasted so much and losing so much motivation to really grow and build it instead of being wasted. 

Heavy weekends were resulting in 2-3 day hangovers and comedowns further compounding things.

Fast forward 20 years and I had switched countries but subconsciously just tried to replicate the same lifestyle. Since moving to this new country much stronger, ""proper"" weed had become easily and constantly available. But it was taking a serious financial and mental toll. An ounce and a half month was eating $400+ of my meagre wages, and again another relationship didnt survive, compounded by the loneliness of being an immigrant. New ""friends"" were just stoners slightly intrigued by this new foreigner to smoke with, but the resulting friendships not being deep or meaningful at al.

Fast forward 5 years and i'm nearly 40. I had an amazing job travelling around Asia selling software which gave a great six figure income, a nice wife and 2 small kids. When I came back from those trips I would rush to the garage for that first bong, or scuttle around for days trying to score an ounce if I had left dry. Instead of spending time with the kids and the wife each morning I would be out in the garage at 6am getting high, and straight back in there when I got home at 6pm, making appearances for dinner and kids bedtime before going back out. I lost complete touch with my wife and found myself approaching 40 with a small handful of friends and still blowing $400-600 per month on weed. I went to work in the office most days after a few hits before leaving, so I'm sure I must have looked blazed to my colleagues and once again, small isssues or fights at work I now think I blew way out of proportion. That's the irony of weed, its supposed to make you chill, but a few hours after that morning hit I know I was a dick to work with. I'm sure I must have smelled of it too.

COVID came along and being locked-down at home was like a dream. I could get WAAAAAAAASTED all day and nobody knew. Daily Zoom and Teams calls were done with the Bong in one hand and the webcam turned off. I was munted all the time for months. That's when I really hit rock bottom mentally, enough was becoming enough, the thrill was gone, the child is grown, the dream is gone,

I had become comfortably numb.

I stopped. 20 years of constant bong and I stopped. At first it was not too bad, as when travelling I had often gone on 1-2 week work trips and dealt with the initial 2-3 days of sweats and nosleep. So I thought ah yeah this isnt too bad I can nail this.

But it was the next 2-3 months that were very, very hard. I had left my cushy job to go contracting and due to bad timing that contract ended up early and I struggled for 2 months to find new ones. Meanwhile my brain was going through what I now see as a total rewiring. I fought and fought and fought with my wife, sank into clinical depression and really struggled to pull out of it. I turned to counselling and through his amazing guidance I turned to meditation. That really did work, taking time to reset and relax the brain is so important as we leave weed and should be the first tool in anyone's toolkit who wants to stop. Second was exercise as many people say. Forcing yourself to walk for 15-30 minutes each day does great benefits. I haven't managed to join a gym yet but one day.

The other thing is talking to loved ones and not stonewalling but openly sharing, talking and trying to reconnect. Reaching out to your entire network of mates and perhaps performing a sweep of the ones that dont matter, whilst reengaging the ones that do is very beneficial. Nature really does look just as nice without THC, so go stare at the beach or some clouds or some trees and you'll realise the natural high does actually exist. You can get high on life.

Now passing 4.5 months and its not too bad now. Sleep and everything is fine, just sometimes I do pang for a few hits. I've smoked twice randomly at parties and had no issues just carrying on with sobriety afterwards, if anything it reminded me that its not that big a deal and not as much fun or amazing as my brain remembers, its just not something I care about any more or will ever pay my own money for. If I get handed a joint I know I now have the skillls to enjoy it for what it is at the time and forget about it the next day. I am no longer an addict.

Its especially  hard in the music scene to avoid it, so if I did ever get back into bands and jamming I dont think I could do it as that world does often have so much smoke in it, but you've got to just take each day as it comes and if your personality doesnt allow for a random odd toke then don't do it.

Mentally you must prepare for a rough 6 months, dont assume all will be fine after the first 1-2 weeks, sure that part is hard but for me it was the following 3 months that were much harder and for mental health reasons I had no idea how to prepare for. This forum is great but I've noticed how you ofte dont hear from people in that month 2-4 point, probably because they're in the depths of depression, so watch out for that and go seek professional help. Don't try do it alone.

For context:
I stopped smoking because even when I wasn’t high I was still hazy and disassociated and that made me uncomfortable. I smoked for a few months when I was 16 then quit, then around 6 months when I was 17 and quit, and now I’m 18 and two months clean from those 6 months. This past time has been the only time it was difficult to quit. 

So two months later I still feel hazy and disassociated and it’s hard to explain but it feels like I’m living my life through a different lens. It almost feels like I’m living on a different software if that makes any sense. I’m terrified I screwed up my development and will never be able to return to normal, and it doesn’t help that I’m existential normally and the disassociation makes it worse. This happened the first time I quit and I went back to normal after a few weeks but after two months I’m scared. If anyone has advise or can share similar experiences I’d love it if you did.

It's 11am and I'm on my third, better go for a walk but it looks grey outside. Its 3pm now and I've had about 5 joints, better lie down for a bit. Now its 6pm time for dinner and a joint for dessert.

I needed to write this to calm the part of me that misses that instant connection, the rich internal life that provided a game and a reason.

I find that if I *don't* have something to occupy me (like work or volunteering) that I feel incredibly depressed. I used to get bored and smoke weed so that the boring things weren't so boring. Now, when I feel bored or like I don't want to do things, I end up just...not doing anything. I often feel apathetic or that things are simply not worth doing.

I'm such a stoner I don't even know what day was my last day. I didn't mark it. I'd been intentionally slowing down my pace. I just picked Monday the 19th because I think I smoked the 18th but don't remember exactly.

I stopped drinking in early January this year. And want to live a clean and righteous life for my little girl. She's 2.5 years old, my sun rises and sets with her, and modeling a life of intentional direction and passion is important to me.

Backstory:

39 year-old dude. Wife and a kid. Good job. Have a house. I've been a functional stoner for a long, long, long time. I believe the first time I smoked was the summer after 8th grade. I got high at school the second week of 9th grade. That would've been early September 1995. I started regularly smoking my junior year of high-school, and was probably an everyday smoker by the end of my Senior year.

Over the years, my budget got bigger, and I was able to buy bigger and bigger bags of the ganja. My life did not revolve around weed, except during really tough times. I'd lean on old Mary Jane too much and up my intake and tolerance, which can have an exponential effect. Long gone are my days of being a competitive smoker, but I definitely have consumed my share over the last 20+ years. And I've smoked everywhere. Never been busted, but definitely didn't hide like some of my role models did.

What changed:

I've had periods of sobriety. like total sobriety off of weed and booze. for \~6 months. But usually i've slipped back into one and then the other. Buds and Suds was the mantra when I watched other people go to the hard stuff.

Covid smashed the world last year. I felt like i'd been trapped in my house for a year. And that was after a year of being at home A LOT, and not sleeping ENOUGH with a newborn and infant.

So at the beginning of the year, I stopped drinking. Not on the first. I'd always been someone who added in things at the beginning of the year, but this year I wanted to cut things out - booze being a demon for me at times. I don't remember exactly which day either, but think I can back into the second Friday in January. I 'd already slowed down drastically but had a tequila shot with my wife to celebrate the end of a career chapter and the beginning of a new one.

Fast forward to this summer. My toddler has been repeating things. Celebrated the 4th hard at my family's place in VA. Went legal rec on the 1st, and being a civil disobedidant who grew up in the bible belt, their is some civil protest I see with weed here. Too many people getting their lives discarded and thrown into the system for a plant (off-topic but ties into who i am as a smoker and a leaver). ...one of the weekends before or after that we'd stayed home for the weekend. My daughter woke up from her nap and had gone outside to play. I went out front to rip a bowl and had to bring it back in after it was clear. I sat upstairs to catch up on some work and my wife and kid came in.

Heard my daughter say ""what's that smell?"" in her joking cute toddler voice. She's very attuned to changes in her environment, and usually says this when Daddy toots, or is cooking something or has been in the bathroom. But she meant weed. And I don't like lying to her, and grew up in an environment where similar things probably happened. That moment sunk in over the next few weeks.

I'd told myself, no existential crisis at 40. Had one at 25. But this approaching milestone is making me reflect. I want my daughter to grow up with a model of someone who pursues passions and strengths and goals with passion, and strength. Not a shell of my potential. I am doing this for my wife. And for my daughter. And most importantly for me.

Now:

Day 11. Have had some dreams, but not too many. I've gone without weed for months before and know they come. Sometimes more than others. Sleep is ok. I need to work on my sleep habits in general. But used alcohol to sleep quite often. Cutting that out helped. Tended to prefer sativa and didn't use it to sleep often.

My life needs to change. Change and growth are inevitable, but dependent on the direction we push towards with our decisions and actions. I want to be in control of that change and growth and need to direct it instead of it being directed by my choices to consume.

The days have not been easy thus far. My emotions have overwhelmed me at times. But I'm here. I'm checked in. And although I love ganja, and it will be a long road to get over my old lover mary jane. It's time to say goodbye and put some space between us. It's time to become the best version of my self and I can't do that with her in my life. I think I've gone so deep I've lost sight of what my real dreams, and passions and potential could be. Some of them I know, some not so much anymore.

I'll be posting here to process and learn, and share experiences.

Love and Respect to each of you on your journey.

I went to jail 4 times for probation violation for a total of 22 days and was on probation twice. The first time i was 17 and stayed sober for 5 months and the second time i was high all of my probation, hence the violations.

I had waves of stomach pain and felt my intestines just complaining, I've knew on that moment, my body was done with it.
I've smoked daily for 2yrs. 

I had alot of eye openers this week, how the weed effected my daily life.

Looking back my whole interaction with weed, it really creeps up into your life.
I have my faundation in life:
- Finances are good
- steady full time Job
- bought a house
- sweetest wife by my side
- healthy

My first interaction with weed was in my younger years like 10years ago, and only did some edibles once a month (I'm 28now).
From that point it came to once every 2 weeks, then to once a week, even played with the dose, instead of eating 1 plack taking 2.....

Then came in the switch 3 years ago to the vaporizer.
Used a cheap Vaporizer for 2 years, reason: ""Edibles made me feel fatigue the next day"". 
Vaping didn't make me feel fatigued the next day, so yeah easy right? 

I vaped then 2 times a week, but quickly went to every day. 
Upgraded my vape to a better one and increased the dose, until 7 days ago where my body sed: ""here and not further!"". 

I've started the edibles just to have a good night, and do it occasionally, but this just went waaaaaay out of hand. 

And it happened right in front of my eyes 👀.....

I did not need weed in my life, but now I see it had taken over every aspect of my life. 

It took over my:
-work stress
-private life stress
-demotivated me to excersise
-demotivated to help my wife doing things around the house
-giving me a loose belly (had to go to the toilet every hour) 
-sexual problems 

And important of all, it took over all my free time since I just sat high on the couch all day when I was free. 
I was at that tipping point where I even started to smoke before work, and tought it was beneficial for me😳. 

I've quitted on the right time, before losing everything. 
I can't believe I was so blind to all of this, people need to know, even when you are not smoking a joint, with vaping you get waaaaaaaaaay more substance in your body than smoking with the same amount. 

Yes smoking is bad, but you need to see the truth fully, and not just lean on only the ""beneficial positive"" posts, I was so convinced it wasn't a big deal, but guys do your research and see the full truth, see both sides! 

Yes it has it purpose, but not for me😔
You need to be honest with yourself, that weed voice is REAL! 
it will convince you that it's good for you, giving you a blind eye to what really is going on! 
Blaming everything on other things or people, making it logical in your head. 

WAKE UP!!!
 
I've fergot how life sober was, and everything I was struggling with when I was high, is just a breeze sober and way more doable. 
I can even push myself to do more. 
It feels like I can use my brain fully and think better, deeper and further. 

I see it in my private life, work life, my thoughts and excersise. 

I just wanted to share my story, but I'm closing the cannabis chapter here and leaving this substance behind me.

Stay strongg everyone and one thing, even when you are high, you can fool EVERY ONE.

I turned 30 recently and it dawned on me that I’ve spent half my life stuck in a haze. I also realised that my body just wasn’t coping anymore. I struggle to breath most days, and yet, whenever my breathing would get better, I’d use that opportunity to smoke again. But, enough is enough.

I managed to quit weed for three months about a year ago, but fell back into it soon after. 

I know it’s possible. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But damn, am I bored... I have so many things I could do, yet nothing interests me. 

But I know I have to stick to it. For once in my life I’m going to show myself who’s the boss: me. 

I want to be free of all my addictions, and the only way I can do it is through sheer power of will. 

It’s day 3. Again. If I fall, I’ll get up again and start over. But until then, I’ll keep up the good fight. It’ll be worth it one day. I know it will.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42118657}"

2021-07-29 01:45:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/otrhh7/day_1224/,Day #1224,"Hey guys! 

I haven't been here in a while but I thought it was time for a check in. 

Reading everyone's post that are in their first few days/weeks helps me so much. The further I get from my last smoke the more I tend to forget what it was like back then. 

I can relate so heavily and on days like today I really needed that reminder of just how bad it was. I can never forget that if I go back I'll be right back there. 

I saw someone comment today that when they smoked they would immediately hate themselves for it and it would get really dark. That was me x1000. 

My story is long and arduous and I won't bore you with everything. I'll just give you the short of it.

I started smoking at thirteen and went on for almost a decade. I've been to inpatient rehab, spent several years in sober housing, and still attend AA meetings (not as often as I should). My last relapse was the worst of all (it always gets worse, never better). I was in a very dark place. If I'm honest I don't know that I'd survive another relapse after that. 

So as you can see relapse is a big part of my story. Those around me would say I ""wasn't truly ready yet"" which infuriated me but maybe they were right. Maybe I had to go to that dark place to truly understand. My longest period of sobriety before today was just a year or so. Today, at 25, I can proudly carry my three year coin with me. 

The reason I'm here today is because I felt like I was being tested today. A coworker hit a dab pen right next to me and when I got home a neighbor was smoking a joint where I take my dog to go to the bathroom. It just smelled so good. The thought crossed my mind that it would make the pain/stress of life go away. 

Work, COVID, my marriage. Things are tough sometimes and I thank God that you guys are here to remind me what happens if I go back. 

I don't want to be all doom and gloom. My life is better now than it ever has been and I would never be here if I didn't quit. I take my blessings for granted far too often. 

I guess at the end of the day I want you all to know that you're not alone! Everything you all talk about when you are first quitting I felt. 

Everyone is different but for me the cravings never go away completely. There's good days and bad days and I need to remind myself frequently why I do this. 

Things definitely get easier and I want you all to know there is a light at the end of the tunnel. 

If I leave you with anything it's this: I remember my first month sober (been through it a few times) and it is TOUGH. The sleep, the emotions, feeling alone in a crazy world. I just want you to know that it does get better and you are definitely not alone! This place saved my life when I needed it most, hang out here if you're having a tough day. 

If anyone ever needs anyone to talk to I'm always around. Always feel free to reach out. For me, having someone to talk to was my saving grace. 

I love you all, and again thanks for all the posts I read today. I really needed them!",28,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4102914}"

Hi! 

I’m 18 and I grew up in a family full of pot smokers. Mainly my older siblings. Bc they did it I started doing it. I started smoking two years ago, when I was 16. But when I left home I really picked it up. 

And it wasn’t bad. I had a great past year smoking weed. A lot of good times. But also a lot of bad times. I’m not sure how much weed contributed to either, but I do know that I don’t remember much. 

I hate not remembering things. I also hate being anti-social. As someone who wants to become an improv performer, a sketch writer, standup comedian, or actor (I like to keep my options open ;) ) it was extremely difficult to fully focus on my craft. 

Today is my second day of not smoking weed. Well I kind of cheated and used not THC flower but the other kind that’s more chill, but still even just one bowl of that compared to the 4-5 I used to hit regularly, is a huge improvement. 

I’m moving to New York soon to pursue my dreams and there’s a lot of pressure on me. Which makes it easy to want to go to pot. But I know that if I can stay clean, keep my head clear, I can get myself where I need to be. 

I’m really glad I found this community a couple months back. These past few months I’ve been working up the courage to truly stop, but I decided last night, it was time.

I’ve struggled with cannabis use disorder for 10+ years (I’m 30). I didn’t even realize I was addicted for the first 5 or 6 years. In the past few years I have taken some breaks - a few weeks here and there - but could never make it stick. It was easy to quit when I would move to a new place, or be on the road traveling, but each “new chapter” would slowly devolve into full on addiction, self-isolation, and depression/anxiety.

Late 2019 I hit rock bottom. I hadn’t left my apartment for a few days. There were delivery food boxes everywhere. I looked around and it really hit me - holy shit I need to make a change. It was close to January 1, 2020. A new decade. I told myself this was it. This was my time to turn it around. I got high as hell after my New Years celebrations and threw all my weed and paraphernalia out the next day.

I was clean for 2.5 months, going strong, feeling like I had finally turned a new leaf. But mid-March, when countries started locking down, I left my international job and returned to the US to live with my parents. I thought it would be temporary. A couple weeks went by in lockdown and I was fine - didn’t feel like I needed to get high. But then I got bored of being locked in my house all day. I started smoking again, and the downward spiral began.

It’s been almost 1.5 years and I’ve basically been high ever since. I tried quitting numerous times. I’m still living with my parents. I have no job and basically no job prospects. I know I will never break this cycle while being stuck in my childhood bedroom.

I’m on vacation with my family now. It’s been 4 days clean. Today I’ve been in a sour mood all day, dealing with suicidal thoughts, even thinking about the best way to off myself. I don’t actually want to die, and I’m not gonna kill myself - but the mind is a crazy bitch!

After vacation I’m moving out. I just need a change of environment. Gonna keep this streak going.

Anyway, fuck COVID. Totally derailed my life the one time I was finally back on track. To anyone with a similar story - I feel you. Let’s get this thing back on the rails. ✌️",63,"{'covid': 2, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.698505}"

For a while I was afraid that I would become someone I didn't know; that I would be a different person on the other side of all this.

You figure out what works and doesn't work and you get to appreciate all your successes and accept your failures so you can continue to move forward in life. 

This has been and will continue to be an insane journey. I have learned that I can survive a whole hell of a lot more than I thought I could and that I do have willpower; that I am fully capable of making positive changes in my life, even among all the bad shit.

I got my degree, 2:1, got into an amazing relationship with the love of my life when I was 20 (still with her now) and shuffled nicely into standard office job and was renting a house. Figured I'd done it all right, as you're supposed to and could still smoke everyday so what's the problem?

Then the penny dropped. It's the repression drug, the dream killer. Everything I wanted to change about myself, or improve on? Nah, too long, have a joint instead, you'll feel better.

Finally had enough and since I moved home to my parents at the start of the pandemic (fuck paying rent when you're working from home). I eventually was smoking during work, and all night after work, sometimes even before work. It all got too much. Decided I needed more hours in the day to sort my addictions out. Quit my full time job with the hopes of stopping smoking, cooking and eating better, exercising more and just generally being more appreciative of life.

I quit my job in February and went to two days a week at my friend's car business, and have only just done my first month without weed. Fuck me, I miss it. I've repressed so much over the last 7 years that I'm struggling to handle it all. I've been working on the other stuff too, but Christ, most days I wake up and have to spend hours convincing myself not to just get a shit load of weed and whatever else I can get my hands on and fuck off to somewhere on my own, have massive binge and end it all.

TL;DR: Thought that stopping smoking weed would cure all my problems, it doesn't work like that.

It's been 48 days now with absolutely *no* cannabis!! Feeling pretty proud of myself right now, especially seeing as I have been a regular, every day, smoker since I was 17 (I'm now 27). Except for a nearly year and a half stint of quitting two years ago, I've been smoking and dabbing and vaping to excess. 

Full disclosure, the almost year and a half sobriety I achieved before was kick started by a psychotic break that was most likely drug (dab) induced at a music festival. Fun times. 😬 And yet, after nearly a year and a half, all it took was me smoking a joint on New Year's Eve with my friends to get me right back into that harmful pattern of addiction, even though it was damaging my mental health and sanity. 

48 days ago, I decided that enough was enough. I was spending so much money and time getting high. I was zoning out of life. I was increasingly paranoid, and had started to hear voices again. I was scared. My psychiatrist and therapist had been gently urging me to quit again for some time, and yet I didn't want to listen to them. Until 48 days ago. I've realized that I don't need to smoke before everything I do anymore. I don't need to numb out of all my difficult emotions. I don't need to waste my mental health and intelligence on always thinking about when I was going to get high next, and where I was going to get weed from. I finally came to the conclusion that cannabis *wasn't* making my life better. It was actually making it worse. 

Now, after 48 days, I'm so much more conscious and clear. I'm less paranoid, the voices are starting to dissipate, and I'm getting my motivation back little by little. It isn't easy, by any means, but it's worth it. My life is worth it. Here's to growth! 🌱

TL;DR
I quit smoking weed, for the second time, 48 days ago. I was a daily heavy smoker from the age of 17 (now 27). I had quit for almost a year and a half before relapsing two years ago. I initially had quit due to a psychotic break. Now I'm feeling so much better, and am looking forward to more changes and growth.",24,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.40265188}"

I ended up getting so sick that I went into DKA and an ambulance had to get me. I remember asking the nurses to please put me out because the nausea was so awful. I told them I had two children and would do it again to trade the nausea. It was unbearable. 

They did end up knocking me out with medications because if I was awake I was dry heaving.

To read the relapse stories to remind myself how brittle recovery can be. And to feel part of a bigger community.

I'm going to the boxing gym several times a week, I started running, I meditate daily, I eat healthy and I read instead of staring at a screen in my spare time. I have goals I want to reach.

Every day I'll stop smoking tomorrow and every day I feel so upset with myself that I ended up smoking.

Yet I keep doing it every night or afternoon with some new excuse every day. I feel like I'm just stuck in this awful loop. 

I don't want to do it anymore but it feels like every day I'm just stuck inside my house with no structure cause of this fucking pandemic, I'm usually an out going person but I've been smoking so much these past 6 months/year that I really just want to smoke and hide and be alone yet I don't even enjoy it when I do it. It's always so easy to just crawl back into that hole and skip a day but I really don't want to do this anymore. I know I can't self moderate so I keep telling myself I'm going to quit but it's killing me waking up every morning going to quit yet every night finding an excuse to smoke. It's an emotional roller coaster every fucking day. I've tried giving my pieces away but I always find something hidden or leftover or find some way to smoke, it's so simple and easy to just walk down the store to a dispensary.

 I can actually have conversations with people now without having blank moments where I don't know what to say.. that is a win in itself!! I no longer avoid people from fear of acting weird around them!

Managed to make it 200 days clean and wanted to share how much less effort and more fun holidays are when sober! 

When I arrived my ""spidey sensors"" were going overtime. Within 5 minutes my head had scouted out all the places I could vape away from my cabin, which walk I could do first to vape a little bud etc. I started smoking weed when I was 13 and now early 30s and have struggled with this addiction so much of my life. 

Holidays used to be a huge sense of anxiety, if staying in the UK I would be scouting out spots to vape (you cannot vape in the open here, well you could but 100% not ok around kids/families) and if abroad I would be forced to have a week in withdrawal (also not fun). I spent my honeymoon in withdrawal and didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. 

The relief of being able to relax and enjoy this holiday without cannabis really makes me realise the control this addiction has on me and even now I'm clean my brain scouting out all the ""vape spots"" was such a reminder of this.

(Rattly breath and black stuff was every 3 or so days, like it built up for a few days then I'd cough it up- and repeat) 
I recently went for a doctor's appt and asked about it, but of course they had no real answers for me and ordered a lung function test, a chest xray, and a blood workup. Waiting on those results. Just curious how many of you experienced this and for how long? I can imagine that if you also smoked tobacco it would be the same if not worse.

I've gone through phases where I've smoked everyday but my usage has been sporadic since I started 5 years ago. I've tried quitting, but it's hard when all your friends get faded every day. It's even harder when they're not nearly as dedicated as I am to quit. They know they're addicted but don't want to quit and it's honestly super sad to know that my friends and I are addicted. I've always been the ""light"" smoker compared to most of my friends, but I don't even consider myself a light smoker. The longest I've abstained from weed willfully was 54 days and then I convinced myself that I'm the problem, not weed. Which is true to some extent, but I also know weed is a problem when you're craving/thinking about it often. I think abstaining for at least 6 months will give me a better idea of how I function with no weed in my system. I relapse because I tell myself it's okay to smoke as long as I'm getting my shit done and not being a lazy slob. I guess I'm a ""functional stoner"" but I also feel like I could be stunting my potential by getting high often. I've been sober for a week and my irritability is awful. I hate it and I can't focus on my schoolwork now. I've passed all my classes with decent grades whilst smoking, but I don't quit during school because I know my mood plummets and my irritability skyrockets.

Once you break away from the false reality that Weed provides, the real world is full of beauty but of hard work and hard realizations. We are all working through these. If you're reading this now on this sub, you're making an effort. I never thought I would be at 40 days, but here I am. You have all the tools to do it too.

Here's my story. I had been smoking non stop for over four years straight. 2-3 grams a day. Edibles. I even had a stint at a start up where we allowed to smoke at work. Abused the fuck out of that. I never even enjoyed what weed did to me after I began more than a year of consistent use. I never realized that I was using it as a psychological crutch to numb the pain I wasn't willing to uncover or explain to myself. I always had this deep desire to know things for certain, (what I now know as OCD) and would use weed to see if I was able to figure out the world. I thought with my high brain that I could come to conclusions about religion, morals, societal issues, etc. Now I know this may not be you. It probably isn't. But the point of these words is to highlight that I had a desire to use weed and then had a desire to stop. My reason is my own and yours is your own. I recognized a problem. This is good news. And I stumbled many many times. This is the first time Ive posted on this sub where I feel like I have genuine control and very few urges to smoke again. The ultimate catalyst for what made me stop was that I began to lose people around me who didn't know how bad weed was for me. Thats the crazy thing about it. Its become so normalized to smoke weed in our culture that it's become difficult to differentiate between who should and shouldn't use it. It's just normal now. And I definitely should not have ben using it. I know I'm susceptible to smoke again, I am tempted just like you who is reading. I'm not any more strong-willed. Any better. But I made the decision to accept that weed isn't for me. It's not bad, it's usually pretty funny. It's not an evil compound, it just doesn't work for me, and that's ok. Much of my own mind shift has come from understanding that weed is not BAD, it's just not something that is helpful for my own set of mental circumstances.

Now much of my own sobriety over the past 40 days has been a real test. It's not easy, because you start to understand that reality is no longer synonymous with reality when consuming weed. In some ways, when I was smoking all the time, I just saw the world in a different way. I wasn't really present, I just wanted to get high. When I took away weed, what I really took away was my urge to leave my present reality. I had to endure and still have to endure it every day. And that's fucking hard. Giving up weed has been incredible because I've started to remember who I was outside of it, but it cannot be stressed enough that it comes with the new problems I've never faced with a sober mind. There is no way to sugarcoat this reality. I still have much to learn, especially from those who have gone much longer without weed, but I want to encourage those of you who want to start right now. Who want to approach the world with a fresh set of eyes. I am really thinking only the best for you here. If any of you need a boost or just someone to chat with, feel free to PM.

The first two years I would smoke 1-2 packs of blunts every day while taking many other drugs. I've frequently quit for a couple of days at a time with my longest break lasting about 2 months (the first time I got all 90s in university despite having my most difficult course load) after which I relapsed brutally. I also drank frequently and I also consumed a fair amount of nicotine daily (which I never quit during the 4 years). This time I've quit nicotine and weed cold turkey for about a week.  


It's strange to say but I have attribute quitting so easily this time to two factors. One, I spent my whole life very nihilistic and atheistic believing I am infinitely small and meaningless in the universe and after careful consideration of other viewpoints along with extensive reading I've come to regard that as equally legitimate to the alternative theory which is that there is a god and that I am more meaningful than I can understand (for example, my butterfly effect on the universe is infinite, or I am infinite as I am part universe, etc). The latter being a more useful philosophy for life. The other factor is a series of negative experiences that haunt me in the most healthy way possible. Every inch of my apartment and car is clean, I've knocked out an enormous amount of errands I've put off, I haven't missed a day of working out, and my hygiene is impeccable. Anytime I'm about to slack off or be lazy I allow the memories in willfully and try to feel them in the worst way possible. I've never prayed in my life (maybe when I was a little kid but I don't remember) before this last week but I read somewhere that if you want to pray and have your prayer answered then ask for enough suffering and terror to make you stronger. That is the only prayer that will be consistently answered. I think many (if not all major) religions have a take like this which makes me wonder if that is the entire purpose of religious systems in our minds. In the past, it was a conscious effort of resistance every single day not to have weed but strangely enough, this time around the thought of it disgusts and annoys me. It's not that I'm unaware of the pleasure but more so that I see the part of me that wants it as something alien almost like a virus.

This reminds me of my last quit, which lasted six months until one day I looked at my life and saw I was still seeming to have the same problems as when smoking daily. Back there again… main problem is lacking motivation/discipline to get work done every day, not just money work but household chores, late tax returns, unpacking the car from the trip, etc. 

I posted from another account this weekend about a victory in choosing not to smoke when I had every reason to. The next day was even more - I was at a party where everyone else was taking bong rips, and I was in pain from a visible injury earlier in the weekend, but still stood firm on not smoking. Then on my way home from the trip I had a little heartbreak when I found out the woman I’ve been texting with for a month isn’t even single, because I’d never directly asked before… and I felt used and profoundly alone, and really wanted to get high to get away from my thoughts and emotions. But still I didn’t smoke. 

Not smoking has actually been way easier than I expected it to be, once I just made the firm decision that I wasn’t going to do it. Of course I still haven’t fully committed - there’s still a few grams of medical weed and all my kit where I’ve always kept it, just in a drawer slightly out of sight. I really should get rid of it. I just don’t see it as making much difference since I’ve gotten rid of it many times before and it takes me no time at all to restock everything.

Before I had no idea how I let it get so bad? Now I’m starting to forget how I turned it around.

But I won’t let that happen. I’ve kept a journal, not consistently but often enough that when I look back on it I can see how my thoughts and feelings have changed over time, I can see myself maturing and taking on newer and bigger challenges. I can see myself coping with failures, big and small. I see that my life has been leveling out and not rocking back and forth so much.

It scares me when I have moments where I miss the high. It scares me that I look fondly on the times I had. It scares me that if I were to meet someone I really liked and wanted to hangout with, that I would be tempted heavily to smoke again.

But I am willing to face that. Because I am more certain of this path. Compared to my whole life, my childhood trauma and the years leading up to my decision to quit, these last four months I have never felt so confident and so sure of myself and the direction I am heading. I’m starting to look farther and farther ahead and dream bigger dreams and life goals. I’m actually building out plans with short term goals to aim for that will help me get there.

This isn’t the end of my story, it is far from it. I know that I am more than my addiction.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49007556}"

It kinda feels like dropping out of the world and I can't engage with anything. And I don't go outside, don't exercise, don't eat well, and it all goes downhill pretty fast.

I recently started getting really anxious and felt like my life and my control over it was falling apart so I finally decided to just stop.

The last week was extremely difficult, lots of panic attacks and just a general sense of no direction and meaninglessness but today and yesterday I feel like I'm becoming myself again. Im finding myself thinking of doing things I enjoyed doing while high (I thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy them if I stopped smoking).

I've been more readily available to help those around me and actually more eager to do it. I'm more willing to do small tasks that I would put off for days and weeks (like cleaning my cats litter box or something) now I'm just doing them everyday. I've stopped biting my nails incessantly and I don't have the same need for jerking off as I used to as weird as that may sound. I just feel more humbled and less cynical about my life. I really hope I can keep this going and build up from here...

Just felt like posting somewhere about it cause I can't really tell anyone lol. All my friends are stoners and Ive been skipping my turn and I don't think they'd get it since they all started smoking at like 18 or 19. I have a very different relationship with the herb than they do.

First time posting here. I'm a little over 2 years sober from alcohol, and have frequented stopdrinking, and found a lot of help in posting there in the beginning of sobriety, so I thought I'd try posting here since I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new sobriety chapter.

I don't even know what to say right now other then I'm struggling to admit to myself that weed is actually effecting me as negatively as it is, but idk what other things in my life could be causing my anxiety and depression to take such a strong hold. I quit my job because I have money saved and I wanted to pursue making my art for a living, but I ended up spending most of the first month just self medicating through my fear and anxiety of being able to actually do this. A month in and I somehow feel even farther away from my goals. Also got some health anxiety over some symptoms I've been having, and so far the doctors haven't figured out what's causing them. Plus starting therapy again recently and reflecting on my childhood traumas. Plus getting engaged and being afraid of such a big step, and also feelings lots of feels around how much I want my own family involved. Now that I write that all out, it's easier for me to see that there's a lot on my plate to make me feel overwhelmed and to make me want to escape.

It's interesting how much more subtle yet just as damaging the hangovers are with weed compared to alcohol. Sunday I went all out, lost count of how many edibles I ate in-between the joint and countless vape hits. Yesterdays hangover was maybe one of the worst weed hangovers I've ever had. I tried convincing myself that if I got less THC focused strains, it wouldn't be as intense for me, but nope, THC in any amount seems to just fuck my shit up. Just complete brain fog, moving my limbs took way more effort then I had energy for, talking fluently was difficult, I felt irritable with my partner, and like I was just a disappointment and drag to be around. I actually was able to focus on some art yesterday, and I have a little more this last week, even throughout the highs. Honestly the highs felt like they helped me to show up to creating, but not as focused and intentional as I'm looking for, and I also don't want my creative routine to be tied to needing a substance to get me going.

So here I am. At yet another day 1, just looks a little different then my alcohol day 1s, but addiction is addiction no matter what you're using, right? I got a little camping trip this weekend. I'm hoping my withdrawals aren't too bad because idk if I can handle roughing it with people that I'm a little socially anxious around while dealing with intense weed cravings. I'm gonna try my best though.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7001726}"

I felt so much better, and I was able to actually live my life instead of slugging along, waiting and fiending for the next time I was able to get high. My anxiety all but disappeared, I had energy, and was getting more out of my relationships and hobbies. I was genuinely happy.

I relapsed about 2ish months ago, and have been smoking everyday after work and all day on weekends since then. Now here I am, right back to where I was before I quit the last time. I'm painfully exhausted all the time, paranoid and scared of other people, and wasting money on something that just makes me feel bad.  I don't understand how I can go from knowing with all my heart that quitting weed is the best thing I've ever done, to being in the throws of dependency to the same substance within two months. I suppose that's the nature of addiction.

I know I am strong enough to quit again because I've done it before. I even quit drinking, and that was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Today I'm going to stubbornly make myself stay sober after work. There will be no compromise. I'm very thankful for this sub, it seems that ya'll are the only ones who understand that weed isn't for everyone, and that some people are better off without it.

But then I started my sober path, on Monday, and she texted me asking if I could go again in a appointment with her. Even I feel like a “stress monster” I said yes because she is my family and I need to give support.

I just turned 33 and have been smoking since I was 14. Daily smoker since I was 18 and was doing about 2-3gr a day up until last Sunday when I decided to quit.

I don't feel weed was holding me back as much as some other posters but I wanted to quit because it is MY choice and I want to show (prove) myself some discipline for a change.

I don't have anxiety when I smoke. I have a loving environment of family and friends. Money isn't an issue (but it sure feels like a waste of it).
  
Now I'm almost done with the 2nd day and I couldn't be more depressed. All I think about is how a joint would make me feel so much better now.

It's hard to justify my resolution to quit when I'm only experiencing downsides.

I also don't know what to do with myself. During the day I can focus on work and it's fine but in the evening I crave it so much. I don't feel like playing games or watching Youtube sober, but I also don't know what I should be doing if not that. Most of my hobbies are also very compatible with weed so I want to avoid doing those things.

Started when I met my partner (32m) who has smoked since age 16. I have always been liberal in relation to weed but it is way too normalised for me now. In the beginning it was helping me sleep a lot and also deal with the aftermath of an abusive relationship I had just gotten out of. Since smoking weed I have learned very well what (chronic) anxiety is as I had never experienced it. I went from being known amongst my friends as a resilient and stable person to someone who cannot even leave their house at times because panic attacks. 

Last summer I was able to travel for a month on my own and I didn’t smoke anything which was amazing. I have previously stopped a few times for a week or two when at home but the temptation of having/others smoking it in the house and my partner also offering it to me (like pls have one with me because it’s the weekend!) on multiple occasions made me relapse. Btw I have explained to him how weed makes me feel and why I am struggling so hard with quitting, and he has first hand seen my panic attacks. I’m now again traveling alone for a month and I’ve already been off it over a week. I still feel anxious but I’m also totally over weed and feeling stronger than ever. 

My question is WIBTA if I ask my partner not to smoke weed indoors in our house, and to keep his paraphernalia hidden from me as best as he can? I also probably would benefit from him not mentioning weed at all. At least until I know I am strong enough that I won’t relapse again. I have asked him this before when things were super intense (me having panic attacks I knew were caused by weed and in desperation attacking what I see as my biggest enemy/weakness) but we always end up in our old habits. I am not saying he’s the cause of me smoking as I am a human being with free will, but I also know that if it’s out of my reach it’s so much more likely I will be able to cut it out of my life for good. I respect that weed is his choice, but this is probably a relationship hill I will die on, and it’d be extremely sad if a relationship which is otherwise perfect would end because of a stupid plant.

So dear r/leaves, WIBTA if I asked my partner to stop smoking in our house, and potentially as well whenever he’s around me, until my head is clear enough to review the situation and I can be confident I can stay clean? It’s his apartment btw if this makes a difference, but we are also getting married next year! Planning our wedding we both also agreed that we need to go three months without weed before the wedding because a) I want to be sure both of us are able to do it so when small kids are in the picture weed will not be part of our lives and b) because I honestly want a wedding without even thinking about weed (if my friends want to smoke I wouldn’t mind as long as they keep it low key). 

Appreciate your input!

EDIT: 1) when I say I feel amazing being away I know I’d feel like even more amazing with him here, but he has work commitments. So it’s definitely not a relief to be away from him - during this trip I have actually realized even more what an unique and special person he is and how lucky I am to have him in my life. It’s just that I feel amazing in that I don’t succumb to my weakness here! 
2) when I say I wanted us to be without weed for 3 months it seems like it’s my decision altogether but he has on many occasions agreed and also voiced that cutting down weed would be helpful for him personally (he says he feels amazing and invincible when he has previously taken breaks) and also for our relationship. I just feel that together we both fall for it and sabotage ourselves, and that if I (who is the one with the biggest issues/side effects with weed) am able to get a grip of this addiction we will be able to find a way forward together being stronger than ever.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45844647}"

Never had a relapse never smoked again. I started smoking in High School and I smoked a lot (me and my friend measured once and together we smoked around 400gr every month). The first JJ  morning on my way to school, and then throughout the day (the lessons would be funnier high). In the evening I would watch some nature documentaries and get high. On the weekends me and my friends would always get high and drunk. So I spent 5 years like that. So life was good, until I got kicked out of school for missing too many lessons after repeating a year for the same reason. So I stopped smoking never did again. I do not miss it, when people ask me about it, I always tell them I smoked enough weed for a whole lifetime.  I cherish the memories, I had fun times, but It was good I stopped. The most important thing I learned in the process, is saying no. I have a lot of friends that smoke weed and every know and then I get offered a drag but I learned to politely refuse. And people that say they don't have no longterm side effects from smoking weed, its bullshit in my case. Weed kinda weakend my ability to learn names. Its not like I can't remember names I just takes me longer to learn them. If I am in a new class it takes me like half a year to remember everyones names. And I am also forgetting names faster. Its not a big problem just something annoying. Why I think weed has to do with it, because when I began High School I had no problems remembering names. How I stopped, I just stopped from one day to the other, it was hard in the beginning but got easier after half a year after that never looked back.

I honestly don’t know what to say but the truth hurts. I myself have been trying to run away from it for the past couple years but I think as hard of a pill as it is to take, it needs to be swallowed. 

I’ve been smoking for the past 4 years to avoid reality. Convincing myself it was a “hobby” I was doing out of my own volition, and that I could stop any time I wanted… Well, let me tell you, there were times where I was playing the whole “oh weed can’t get you addicted” speech but couldnt even go more than a day without experiencing withdrawal symptoms…  
I personally think that weed smokers tend to be a bit defensive and I’m literally not saying this to offend anyone bc I’d technically be offending myself. It’s kinda true though… I mean, despite all the positive stuff that’s been medically proven, you can’t ignore the fact that a lot of people do smoke weed to avoid a lot of feelings they have within themselves, or about their life, or about others. Whatever the reason is, I’m not judging you. Heck, I’ve been there. I’m just saying the path to sobriety is never moderation.. simply because there is no such thing and there never was. While your brain craves those dopamine hits, your heart knows the consequences your addiction carries yet it still chooses to experience that temporary high; and you’re hooked— and the cycle starts all over again… Realize this and understand and ask yourself what is it that I’m trying to run away from? Is my addiction something that I have to hide from others (such as family and friends)? Why? Why do I keep coming back to it no matter how many times I try to stop? What does my need to seek an external tool in order to manipulate my reality say about how I handle both internal and external conflicts

I’ve wasted the past four years of my life while my friends are out there making careers and a life for themselves. I’m responsible enough to take accountability for my actions, faults, and mistakes. I realize i WAS trying to run away from a lot of internal issues but that that was never anything to be ashamed of. I honestly can’t say I’ll be perfect but no matter how many times I fall, as long as I keep getting back up I haven’t lost and neither have you.

All in all, For me, smoking weed was a way to escape reality. As a result, sure yeah I was basically manipulating my brain chemistry to get those dopamine hits but in the end, this addiction was really never worth it. I can’t do anything without wanting to take a hit first because life isn’t fun unless I’m high. WRONG. Literally, the fact that I subconsciously thought this way for years blows my mind and the fact that I was subconsciously spending thousands on this addiction when sometimes I had no money just shows me to which extent this whole situation is something I’m totally over with. See, in the same way that it wouldn’t make sense for a person that’s about to die of lung cancer to moderate their tobacco use, there is no such thing as moderation for weed either. Growth is uncomfortable but so is staying somewhere you’ve outgrown.

2021-07-26 17:10:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/os87a3/a_week_without_weed_my_experience/,A Week Without Weed: My Experience,"Hey folks! Been following along on Reddit for a while, but this is my first time posting!

I’m working on day 8 of sobriety today, and I am so, so proud of myself (and also all of you for being such an inspiration to me of course!).

My story is simple really: I grew up living a sober life in a small town. Somehow, I survived consuming any alcohol or drugs throughout both high school and university -- and even though I was surrounded by it often, I never felt tempted.

Fast-forward to last September: I lost my mother to stage 4 breast cancer. Leading up to this, it's almost like my body somehow knew she was sick, because in June and July I was constantly visiting the emergency room for these insane anxiety attacks that had me thinking I was dying. I was put on prescription medication that I continue to take to this day -- and the only reason why I'm mentioning this is because I think this is one of my greatest saving graces now today (of all the withdrawal symptoms, anxiety has not been very present).

With my mother passing, I decided that I needed to get out there and live a little because life truly can be short. I had alcohol for the first time late last year, and while I did and still do enjoy it on occasion, I didn't have any difficulties controlling myself. Today I'm a somewhat social drinker when I’m out relaxing with friends – but rarely to the point of intoxication. On May 28, 2021, I tried cannabis for the first time. I started off with a 10mg edible on a Friday night, and since then it really just became a blur. I maxed out around 650mg of edibles in combination with constant vaping of 510 cartridges in a day – and this escalation was all over the course of less than 2 months. I have no idea what it is about weed that I enjoyed. Even at absurd amounts the high wasn’t anything to write home about, and it never really heightened my enjoyment of any activities I was doing. Looking back, I attribute the escalation of what I in hindsight can only classify as an addition to general boredom in my life that crept up on me. Needless to say, trying to solve your boredom with the ol’ Mary Jane is not the answer.

After about the first month of consumption, I began to develop some nausea whenever I began to sober up. That nausea was at its worst right after I would wake up – likely because that’s when I was most sober in any given day. I never learned growing up that there could be negative repercussions as a result of marijuana consumption. The drug is painted as all sunshine and rainbows, and even people I’ve spoken to in my personal life over the past week are surprised to find out that one can actually experience withdrawal symptoms as a result of consuming it. It’s absolutely insane to me that it’s not discussed more, and the only reason I myself came to the conclusion that how I was feeling could potentially be linked to my consumption of marijuana was the result of a Google search that led me to this subreddit.

Anyways, I kept consuming to escape the nausea, and with more consumption came a higher tolerance which meant having to consume more and more just to feel something. Roughly 7 days, 15 hours, 20 minutes, and 5 seconds ago I finally clued in that this was a legitimate problem, and that marijuana was bleeding its way into every aspect of my life (work, home, social, etc.) in a way I felt I had no control over. So, I told myself enough was enough, and I quit!

The first two days were absolute hell. I hoped that I would somehow dodge a bullet because I hadn’t really been consuming for that long, but boy was I mistaken. I decided to pair quitting marijuana with getting back into the gym, and on day 2 I found myself hopping off the elliptical to dry heave into a bucket because I couldn’t escape the nausea, and the exercise just seemed to exacerbate everything. My Day 1 note from the I Am Sober app reads as follows, “Day 1. Fucking brutal. Remember when you moved into the bathroom for part of the night just to be closer to the toilet?”. So yeah. That’s about how the first couple days went. Extreme nausea, chills galore, my body temperature was just going from one extreme to the other, I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat anything, and my mouth almost seemed like it was rejecting water. On Day 3, things got a bit better. I finally managed to get a bit of sleep, and the nausea started to come in waves rather than constantly existing. On Day 4 I saw improvement once again, and over the past few days I’ve been feeling MILES better than how I did on Days 1 and 2. Today I even returned back to the gym and absolutely crushed my workout – and it was in that moment that I knew this was a turning point in my life.

I want to thank you all for your posts and messages that have inspired me so much this past week. I genuinely, genuinely couldn’t have done it without you. I thought I was insane, but seeing post after post of people dealing with the same struggles as me was so relieving, and it strengthened my mind to the point that I knew that I could quit for good.

It feels like someone's taken an ice cream scoop out of my chest and there's a gap there now. It feels like I'm a little sail boat on the ocean, and the wind has gone from my sails.

Low self esteem cause I'm looking over my shoulder at what other people have, I'm being hard on myself and not appreciating the progress I've made. I'm working towards goals and giving myself no appreciation for the journey. Because I'm not validating myself, my people pleaser is working over time trying to get other people to praise me- this comes at a cost to the real me, I lose myself.

I don't know where it's come from, all I know it's that it's here. I am aware of it's presence because I'm not smoking it away: I am sitting with the feeling, I'm not trying to wish it away. I feel proud of that. 190 days sober and new feelings are still popping up. New opportunities to find coping mechanisms that are not reliant on substances. 

This week I'm going to try to set small goals that I can celebrate. I'm going to try to see my friends, I'm going to share at NA meetings and I'm going to welcome the people pleaser inside me.

I'm about to be 38 soon and I've been smoking since I was 17. I was a late starter compared to my friends who all started around 15 and 16. My parents were drug addicts at the time and I didn't want to be anything like them. Eventually I gave into peer pressure and now it's 20 years later and I can't believe how many life experiences I missed out on because I was high. I would smoke every day before work and then non stop once I got home. My life's been pretty much a blur.

Recently I lost my girlfriend of a year and a half after she dumped me because I couldn't talk to her about anything really. I would get really upset over nothing and just leave and lie why I was leaving so I could go home and smoke and feel better. I promised her many times I would stop doing this but I never did. So she cut me out of her life completely and I lost not only my girlfriend but also my best friend. I really thought she was the one for me. I had never connected with anyone like I did with her and I would have loved to spend every day with her for the rest our lives.

Losing her was a real eye opener for me. I realized I'm really unhappy with myself and who I've become. I have a really hard time talking about myself because I really don't like anything about myself and it comes down to smoking really. I work a dead end job because I never felt like trying at anything because I could just go home and smoke to feel good. I work for a good company with lots of opportunities in IT. I told my ex last year that I wanted to go to school to get a better job but I never did. Just another lie I told her.

I've tried quitting many times but it never stuck and I would just fall back into my same old habits of just sitting at home alone smoking and playing videogames. I felt like I've spent so much time alone and high that the social part of my brain atrophied and now I really don't know how to talk to people anymore.

Saturday I had the courage to finally throw out my weed and pipe and I was instantly feeling regret, like I needed it. I felt like I wouldn't be ok without. Honestly I still feel that way but I don't want to go back to my old ways at all. I'm doing my best to take it one day at a time and not look back at what I lost and try to focus on my future.",22,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7733725}"

Although, I did that, everyday, for weeks with small breaks that didn't mean as much as I'd have hoped.

I left my credit card in my car, my car parked at my workplace, with only 10 bucks in my wallet.
Thinking ''I won't buy'' 

I didn't have cigs either, really difficult to make do huh? 

Still, I wanted to smoke.

I went around the neighborhood to ask for cigs, three people told me yes, but two offered rolled ones so I had to decline because I can't roll them.


 The last one offered the smallest cigarette I've ever seen.



Still, I wanted to smoke.

I searched my flat for money, found a couple coins, ''Awesome, I'll buy cigarillos if I get hash''


I went to the ''shop'', but when the transaction was about to happen, a yell: scatter! 
Cops were on the way.

I left and went on a walk.


Still, I wanted to smoke.

So in prevision for later consumption, I went to the tobacco shop and bought a couple cigarillos, that would do for a couple Js.

So I came back to the shop, half an hour later, bought my 10 bucks of hash, placed them in my phone case and left.

On the way home, I check my phone, something is off: I open the case, nothing in there.


Fuck.



I check every pocket, the phone case again, trace back my steps: it's nowhere to be found.

No buses to go back to my car in which my credit card is.

Well.

Yesterday night, I ran out of pot. I saw myself open all my drawers, search for small particles of weed, and so on. Sounds like an addict behavior to me, so I decided I had to stop. I threw out my pot stuff.

Some weird pressure in my forehead and not really motivated to do much. Everything seems like a big ""eeehhhhhhhh...""

Then I have thoughts here and there, where I'd go pickup some dank and ease my feelings.

Those thoughts are immediately seen as false, because in the end, my irritation is mostly caused by lack of homeostasis, aka lack of weed (or my body's natural chemical) in my system. Thinking about it in the long-run, I'd just delay this same moment by going out and buying and smoking my brains out. That'd make it worse cus' I'd just be adding ""the poison"" into my system again, and it'd be harder to be sober tomorrow.

As much as I'd like to believe the golden-thought of ""I'd just smoke today, then put the rest away or sell it to a friend"", I've seen many times how it never turns out that way. It'd be another week of smoking, then quitting, then feeling like shit, and the usual cycle and here I would be again, feeling worse than I am. I already have probably close to 7 days of sobriety in the past 2 weeks, so my tolerance isn't as high right now.

This is a good time to quit. Sure I feel low rn, and it's not that fun, but I just don't want to give into the illusion of feeling good for a moment, only to make my body more out of balance again.

It's the end of day 2, I'm staying the course.

My mantra is: **""there's plenty of reason to be sober"".** I say plenty, because I tend to forget all the 10's of reasons why not to smoke, while my only reason to smoke would be to feel better or ""have fun"", which isn't really a good reason at all, because as I implied earlier, smoking is what brought me to feeling this low in the first place. It's not going to get me up feeling better. I'd just be fooling myself again.

The number of times I've bought and regretted it, and smoked and regretted it, is beyond my ability to count.

The number of days I've been sober and been grateful for having the strength and determination to act for the good of my own well-being, even if those days have had hard times, that number is also beyond my ability to keep up with.

I always say this, but I don't think that I've ever truly regretted being sober for the day. That really says something in my opinion.

Very tempted to smoke after a bad trigger happened today. I’m not going to, but it made me curious why I quit to begin with. I smoked because I wanted an escape from reality and difficult emotions. I felt that the temporary “relief” for euphoria and giggles and dissociation was better than feeling so deeply, but eventually I became dependent on the habit, my memory became so bad, paranoia increased, I dissociated all the time, and I felt miserable after comedowns which only made me want to smoke more. I was sick of depending on it, so I quit. And after almost two weeks I feel much better, but the temptation is still high. It helps to remind myself why I started this journey though.

Thought I’d share my experience after being a near everyday smoker for 5-6 years, then quitting for 8-9 months and smoking a few times over the weekends the past couple months.

I quit because weed almost made me feel anxious, cloudy headed, depressed, and just like a shell of myself. No sense of humor, like living life in a weird fog. I tried to quit multiple times but was honestly so physically addicted, I would get hit with long bouts of terrible insomnia that always made me smoke again. 

Once I finally pushed through and got off of it, I really had no desire to smoke again and realized life is so much better without it.

Over the last few months I tried smoking some bud a few times again on the weekends just out of pure curiosity, and despite me getting pretty high it really was not enjoyable at all. The weird state of mind you get into returned, it through off my sleeping schedule for the next few days if I smoked a couple days in a row, and it made me feel lethargic, depressed, and just overall lowsy. I definitely feel my relationship with weed has changed permanently and I have no desire for it anymore. Some people should never smoke again because they can fall back into the same trap, but I’m glad I tested it after all this time and realized I really don’t care or need it anymore. 

I wanted to share this so people know your relationship with weed likely will change with it, especially after a long break. And it won’t necessarily become a chore trying to avoid it. The benefits you get when quitting will be felt pretty quickly and the downsides will be much more apparent when(if) you smoke again.

I've robbed myself of so much in exchange for a high. Today I'm quitting weed for my dog.,"My dog turned 8 not too long ago. His chin is graying, our walks are getting shorter and his naps are getting longer, play time isn't as intense, I can see a little hitch in his gate, and sadly we're on the later half of our time together in this life. I was feeling sad about this, so I got high to help ease the pain and during this I high I sent myself into an extreme bout of sadness accompanied by borderline panic-attack levels of anxiety. This happened because I realized how I've been smoking weed ever since I got my dog. Ever since my memory has been so poor and time seems to have flown by due to living in a disassociated haze. While I certainly remember so many of our experiences and time together, I can't help but feel like I've lost so much of that time and memories due to being high nearly every day for the last 8 years. I've spent most of our time together stoned, while he's spent none of our time together as anything other than himself. I feel like I've robbed myself of valuable memories and time that when I'm much older I will certainly regret. I know a lot of this is guilt I've placed on myself, but I'm also not making excuses for the marijuana use. I gave it up for 4 months in 2019 and my short term memory, memory recall, sleep, and overall brain fog improved so dramatically I'm not sure why I came back (kidding - I thought I could have a ""healthier relationship which turned into daily smoking shortly after). 

Today I'm quitting the daily life of being a stoner and not just for me, for my dog. I don't want to wake up one day and feel like he never existed because our time and memories are so ill-defined and blurry. Maybe in the future weed and I can meet up on the rare annual occasion of a birthday, backpacking trip, or night under the stars. You know, times where maybe the memory of getting high will be one worth keeping. ""Hey remember that time we smoked some pot and counted the shooting stars.""  

But, what weed gives me is nothing in return for being present in the moment with my dog, the things I love, and my life.

I know I can do it. In fact, I put my pipe in a bag of alcohol before I left for work today to clean it off to remove any chance of scraping the bowl. Tonight is going to be tough and so will the next week, but it wont be as difficult as waking up when I'm 40/50/60 and realizing I smoked my life away. Realizing I would have rather been high than in the moment with my best friend.

This is for you, G monkey.

2021-07-26 10:35:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/orzyfk/hello_lovely_people_of_the_rleaves_community/,"Hello lovely people of the r/leaves community. Haven't posted on here for quite a while, but today I decided to drop by and share some of my story and progress. After many fruitless attempts of stopping, this month I am finally clean! And I don't even crave the herb anymore.","So, long story short, a few years ago I moved to The Netherlands. Cliche as it may sound, it didn't take long before I became a weed addict. In the beginning it was all fine and dandy, good times and fun, positivity, no stress, good vibes only. But about two years in I started experiencing difficulties. Firstly, financial problems. Secondly, I was living with a roommate who was constantly shaming me for being a stoner, and after some time my good times turned into a nightmare, because I was constantly dealing with this feeling of guilt for being a smoker, a waste, a failure. Let's just say she wasn't approaching my problem in the most positive way, so I really ended up hating myself.

At that time though, I didn't want to stop smoking weed. I was still enjoying myself, even though my days were also starting to become monotone and sort of gloomy. I tried forcing myself to stop a couple of time, but didn't last more than 3-4 days or a week. I needed to take short tolerance breaks because the weed wasn't making me high anymore and that was frustrating. But deep down, I did not want to stop. I just wanted to feel good again, like I did in the beginning, and I was desperately trying to achieve that feeling.

Needless to say, that didn't lead to anything. Over the next few months, I fell into a pretty bad state of depression and self-loathing. I moved out, struggled to find my place in the world, started experiencing constant anxiety and paranoia. My physical health was also not doing so well, I didn't have an apetite, I was losing weight and had no energy or motivation to get through the days. At some point in June I hit a wall even with smoking. Basically, smoking cannabis started making me so uncomfortable that after a few puffs I would start having a mini panic attack for no apparent reason. Panic attacks are no fun, so experiencing that discomfort was the final straw for me. For the first time in years, slowly, I started reducing my weed consumption. It happened without me even consciously trying to stop. It was more like *my entire being was telling me that I was sick, unwell, and the herb wasn't going to help anymore, only make it worse.*

I kept trying to roll up and smoke up, but it just wasn't working. And oh man, I am so grateful that my body made that decision for me on its own. All these times before when I had tried to force myself to stop, all for nothing. I know many people can do it with willpower and motivation, and I really respect them for that. I strive to be like that. For me though, I had to be forced into literal physical decline in order to lay off the weed for a few weeks and then experience the benefits.

Anyways, now let's talk about the positive bits of this journey - **the aftermath.**

I am now spending the summer in my home country Bulgaria together with my Dutch boyfriend. Funnily enough, the cravings are not chasing me anymore. It's also very nice here because cannabis is illegal and not readily available to purchase, which makes it much easier to stay away from it. My boyfriend wants to smoke, so I occasionally call up my dealer to get him some, but I don't take part in it anymore. See, when you get through the first few weeks, even the temptation isn't really there anymore. *I find this feeling of liberation from the herb to be so satisfying!*

I was lucky enough to experience my liberation as an intuitive and natural kind of process, but I can only imagine how fulfilling it feels to be free from the cravings when you've been fighting to stay away from the drugs for weeks, even months on end, even though you were still craving it. My admirations to all of you beautiful people on here who went through this process, and made it out.

All I can say is, it takes time and patience. And you need to listen to your mind and body, they will be giving you signs. Push through the discomfort and you will arrive at the land of liberation and will rediscover comfort and calmness.

To all of you who are still fighting, I wish you strength and persistence through your journey. It may not work the first, second, fifth, seventh time. *But eventually you will get there*. Maybe when you least expect yourself to.

When I was wanting to quit but constantly failing, I kept using my weekend as an excuse to get some final smokes in before I would change my life (I work a Monday - Friday job). I would always tell myself that Monday would be a new work week and the start of a new me. I’d ditch my remaining weed on Sunday night committed to doing this. 

In reality, dealing with the earliest days of sobriety when you have other commitments and stresses, for me at least, was always too much. By the end of the work day I’d be exhausted and because I hadn’t smoked that morning (since I didn’t have any), I’d end up justifying a return since I was productive all day, so why not? 

This is flawed thinking because you’re not actually better or able to moderate at that point, you just had the addiction convince you otherwise. What I actually found helpful was quitting BEFORE the weekend. Use those days where you can be as stress and commitment free as possible to get a few wins under your belt. Entering the Monday on day 3 of your journey versus day 1 can make a big difference.

I didn’t intend to smoke this much when I took it up and I find that every time I’m running out of weed I tell myself I’ll have a break for a bit then I just cave a couple of days after I run out. 
I feel like it’s all I’m doing and all I look forward to doing when I’m at work and I’m getting a bit lost. I feel like my girlfriend is losing me and that I’m losing myself a bit, I don’t really know what I like doing or what makes me ‘me’ anymore, but she’s reassured me that because it’s helped me mentally that she only sees it as a good thing.

It negatively affected my ability to create strong and lasting relationships in an important time in my life and I feel like I have set myself back mentally. Im tired of wasting the prime of my life being a slave to a deceptively addicting plant. Some symptoms I have noticed over the years of my use are the following; complete lack of motivation/complacency, aggressive mood swings, appetite all over the place, muscle mass loss, lack of dopamine from things other than smoking weed (yes, even sex) inability to think clear about a single topic for more than a minute or two, and a severe lack of mental well-being (borderline depression). My freshman year of college I played soccer (A dream since a kid)and I let the herb even get in the way of that. After completely losing interest in that (HOW?) I transferred to big state university where I smoked pot religiously 4-5 times a day. Blowing through my life savings in a scary amount of time, It got to the point where I would use my grocery money on a half oz. Lying to my parents and even calling my sister up for 40 bucks (she was an idiot for giving me money, God love her) I then failed half of my classes first semester and decided a gap semester might help. Not being in school I was required to pay rent at my house at school. My paychecks went towards rent,bills, and weed. I saw how easy it was to be ok with living paycheck to paycheck, as long as I could come home and rip the bong. Recently, I decided to go back to play soccer at the JuCo level. I AM FUCKING DETERMINED TO GET TO HIGH LEVEL COLLEGE SOCCER again and I’m not fucking it up this time because of such a deceptive plant. In the last 2 and half weeks I have put on around 7 pounds (thank god the appetite came back so quick) have gotten semi game fit and am starting to feel the fog subside. Sleep has still
Been iffy but holy fuck the dreams man. I hopefully will never look back but it is unrealistic for me to say that I will never smoke weed again. So right now I’m climbing out of the hole and ready to experience the highs and lows of
Life without my security blanket. Thanks for listening friends ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤟🏻",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8396025}"
2021-07-26 02:24:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ort03z/i_feel_like_weed_makes_it_hard_to_connect_with/,I feel like weed makes it hard to connect with people. Can you guys relate?,"I am 24 years old and I’ve been smoking weed since I was 15. Something that started as social activity slowly turned into an isolating activity. I was just driving the other day and I finally made this realization as I’ve had trouble keeping friends over the years. Before I started smoking I used to play sports, and making friends was so easy. Maybe I’m just getting old and it’s harder.

I should’ve realized in middle school/high school, that people who smoked weed were a negative influence. The people I smoked with didn’t have the best image among other students. I felt like associating with them brought me down too. Eventually people associated me as the stoner and it made it hard to make new friends.

But at the time I trusted my stoner friends. Not going to lie some of the coolest friends I had were through smoking weed. That was a draw of the herb, as I felt like I was a part of the cool kids club. I thought we would become friends for life. Except when they didn’t. 

But all this did was limit me and put me in a corner. It was hard to become someone in high school when I was labeled a stoner. It got to my head and I dropped all my hobbies and vowed myself to my stoner image. I was shy so I never got to got out of my shell as weed put me in my comfort zone. 

But after college most of my stoner friends went separate ways. We still saw each other occasionally but it wasn’t the same. I felt lost because I couldn’t share my weed habit with anyone anymore. What started as smoking with friends and doing something fun, slowly turned into an activity I did alone to feel better about being alone. 

I was comfortable with half ass friends who were fake or just used me for weed for a while. Because I knew I would go home to Mary Jane at the end of the day. This was good for a while until a breakup. I needed some real support from friends but I couldn’t find any. The only thing I had was weed.  

This made me realize I had no close friends anymore. I failed to find new friends so I ended up alone. Not only that but when I’d see people occasionally, I couldn’t connect with them. I was so comfortable in my ‘zone’ that I couldn’t ever put myself out there. I ended up becoming the friend to always hit people up and being an afterthought of the group.

Basically I will hang around people sometimes but not really be myself. I’ll put on a fake, nice persona since i know I’ll smoke after. But at the end of the day I feel like I’m not being myself so I don’t  attract the right friends. And I feel like I won’t do that until I quit weed.

But this is just a theory so id love to hear some similar experiences. I want to quit but the uncertainty makes it hard to last. I often worry that I’m too old to make serious changes and that it’s pointless to quit. Weed has helped me deal with loneliness but now it’s just making me lonely. I’ve smoked for so long every day, that I find myself being torn on quitting or not. After all weed had been there for me than people have so until someone special comes along it’ll be hard.",47,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48167202}"

A little bit about me, Im 36 yrs old, I started smoking I think if I recall correctly like at the start of 2019, when I met a guy who became my partner for some time (now ex partner), and he introduced me to the this world. Before that Id never smoke, not even normal cigarrettes. I used to be depressed, on and off for a large part of my adulthood, for many reasons, not accepting myself, being gay raised in a homophobic household, never having a normal healthy relationship, and a looong etc, etc, After trying weed I finally felt happy, I think it helped me with some issues in my life, I started to see things differently, at least at the beggining. Eventually weed became my happiness, my drive, my will to do things, my inspirational thoughts became from the moments when I was high, and you know all those things we feel when we get high. A lot of things happened and weed started to became a problem, after 2 years of use I knew I needed to quit. I smoked everyday, I smoked before going to work, after coming from work, before and during my work outs, before going to meet some friends, before sleep, like I needed to be high all the time. 

Me living alone just made things easier, weed became my company, my family, the connections I never had. But I knew I needed to change, I have made my first (and hopefully only) attempt to stop, and so far so good, the only real problem Ive been having is... my dreams. I have had some cravings to smoke but since Ive replaced smoking with exercise, Ive been feeling pretty well, and I have some very clear reasons why I wanted to stop so I just keep reminding them. 

But as I said my main concern are my dreams. When I smoked I barely remember any dreams, the first days after my last smoke, however, I found that my dreams returned, but they were VERY vivid, and even frightening. The first week was horrible, I was afraid of getting sleep, because the dreams were so bizarre. Now Im on day 16, and dreams have became a little better, but the main reason Im looking for help online is to see if anyone knows how to make them stop, or at least make them more bareable in the long term. How long am I going to continue to have these dreams? I wake up feeling like s\*ht bc I cant really rest well bc Im exhausted from my dreaming.  What things worked for you? Please I need some experiences to know what to expect. Thank you all in advance. And big hugs to everyone. I never realized how hard it is to accept ourselves like we are, to give up our weedself (as I call it), and most importantly we are all brave for getting rid of those chains.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45852315}"

I had an extremely high sex drive and never had an issue with sexual performance until the last year. I smoked weed every day for 10 years and am now 30 days clean. 

I quit because I started experiencing erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and a shrinking penis for the last year. I could no longer get it up even alone. I was abusing particularly hard when the pandemic left me with a lot of free time. 

I saw a sexual health specialist who tested all my hormones, which came back normal. Since then. I have been living a completely clean lifestyle, with maybe a 5 percent improvement in symptoms. After lots of obsessive research, I suspect that this happens from a disruption of dopamine in your reward system in your brain. 

I have posted here before, with people offering their experiences, and this seems far more common than I thought. Marijuana was always presented as a benign drug. If I knew it would affect my dick I never would have touched it. It was always a sexual enhancer for me, until now. If I recover, I will write an article on this for other men to benefit.

Now i know exactly what he was going through. Weed does not calm me down at all. Telling myself to calm down does not work its like something takes control of me.

I have to much to say and it's all swirling around in me. I did find some weed and I want to escape these feelings. I'm going to go throw it in the dumpster that is full of rain water. Hold on a minute, I'll be right back.

Wow. I wasn't expecting that. I feel so much better after getting rid of the weed. I've stopped crying and my anxiety is greatly relieved. I also have some good news.

A few days ago I talked with my 19 year old son. He is my only son. I have been a single dad since he was 3. He lives a state away now. He has also been traveling. I have seen him once since the *cor*ona* began. We have been very close in the past but have been drifting apart lately. I felt like he didn't want to see me anymore which could be true but I'm not sure. In week three of quitting I couldn't hold my emotions back anymore. I told him how I felt and that I really want to make definite plans to get together soon. I apologized for some of the stupid things I did in the past. To my surprise he apologized for things he did too.

We made plans to go on a trip together to Maine. I've always wanted to go there. We are in Arizona and California. Exploring is one of our things we love to do together. I am really excited about this trip.

I was at the park yesterday on a rare, beautiful, stormy day. So many many emotions have been welling up lately. Seeing all those families together and all those couples and people with friends was tough. It's not that I'm jealous, it's more like I am just human and want to share in those emotions too. I have just never been very relatable. I have a tough time socializing and forming meaningful, lasting, intimate relationships. 

I wanted to smoke the weed I found. It smelled really good. Where do I even begin in forming new relationships. I'm so akward and It's hard to imagine that I have anything to offer. I can't have sex with the wrong women anymore either. It takes a toll over the years. I need something solid. I'm trying to take steps to create stabilty and create something to offer but this could take years. It may never happen. I would love to have another family but I am not sure if I am being delusional about that at this point in my life.

I sat in the park looking out at the lake. I saw people in little boats and the sun was starting to set. The late afternoon light shown through the monsoon clouds and glimmered on the water and boats. A cool breeze was such a welcome relief from the usual ruthless summer heat. 

I thought, smoking that weed would feel so nice. But another thought came to me. If I was still smoking I wouldn't have had the emotional need to express to my son that I needed to maintain a good relationship with him. It wouldn't be necessary to tell him honestly how much I loved him and missed him. I would not have had the faith to plan a trip and spend the money. It may seem needy, but so what. I'm not ready to disappear. I want our relationship to be strong as he becomes a young man.

The golden light on the water, the boats, the sky, and everyone around me began to solidify my thoughts. My trip to Maine is just over a month away. I want to be clear for my son when we go on this trip. I want to be his rock. Especially in this day and age. I need to maintain sobriety. That's golden. He is golden. He deserves a dad that is clear headed and present. He needs me as much as I need him. I could smoke but I know it's no good and what if I just keep smoking. No don't do it! Work through the sorrow. Be greatful for your good health and be greatful to be alive on such a fine day. Be greatful for this trip. Be greatful you have an incredible son. These decisions may seem small but they are not. They are more valuable than gold. They are about legacy, karma, and love. These decisions define your life.

My whole life was wrapped up in smoking pot. It was my motivation to get things done. It was my joy, my happiness because I had none. It was my social network because so many of my friends smoked too. It was my chill time, my calm down, my creativity, my “I deserve it”, my drug of choice. If I were stranded on a desert island with an unlimited supply of anything, one year ago I’d have chosen weed. 

Problem was, it was also everything that was going wrong in my life. I was losing connection with my family and friends. I was living in a perpetual fog. I was chasing that 20 minute high for the next sixteen hours of every day. I was angry, anxious, impatient, and becoming more and more difficult to live with. But weed was calming me down! No, it really wasn’t. It was just laying a thick blanket of “who gives a fuck” over everything in my life. And that creativity I mentioned? While sober, I’d listen to songs I wrote stoned and wonder how on earth I ever thought that was such a masterpiece. It was destroying my lungs and my brain. 

Weed is a liar. It’s a temptress that leaves you empty handed at the end. Worst of all, it takes your authenticity and leaves you wondering who you are without it. I have spent the last year finding myself, and I can honestly say I have never been happier, more confident, more secure, or more sure that I made the absolute best decision of my life when I smoked that very last joint and threw away all of my paraphernalia.

For a long time, I genuinely believe weed saved my life- it kept me on a normal sleep schedule, it kept me from diving into heavier stuff when I was spiraling, and it kept my depression at bay when it threatened to overwhelm me. But for the past year or so, it doesn't feel like it's helping at all...it felt like something I HAD to do to feel normal, and that's just not who I want to be.

I've felt for the past couple months now that it's time to quit, and yesterday was the last straw. I spent all day yesterday- I'm talking like 16 straight hours- on the couch, watching stupid shit I don't care about on TV, smoking the rest of my weed, making this list of reasons I don't want to smoke weed anymore. I felt like garbage. I felt useless. I felt like the biggest fucking loser on the planet. And I don't want to feel that way anymore.

So here's a list of reasons I'm over this shit. This is day 1 of me not smoking anymore. And yeah, even though the craving is there and there's a small part of me that wants to be high right now, the rest of me is laughing at that guy, because he's a fucking idiot.

The list (Why No More Weed?):

1. Weed makes me fine with being bored

2. I'm dreaming of things instead of working towards them

3. It's getting in the way of work

4. It's stopping me from feeling and I need to experience my emotions to heal from them and move forward as a person 

5. I feel like I'm smoking because I have to, not because I want to

6. Once you get high, that's it, you have to maintain all day...and I get high at like 10AM

7. It's feeding my other bad habits- social media, junk food, TV, sex addition, etc

8. Brain fog SUCKS

9. I want to dream/have healthy sleep again

10. I'm wasting so much money and time on NOTHING useful

11. It's bad for my health

12. I want to actually remember things

I’ve been a regular smoker (daily) for 45 years and feel that I was able to successfully maintain a good career and relationships while using. I definitely don’t have anything against weed and have enjoyed my time with it.

But I’m 61 and became dependent on prescription medications 5 years ago and am trying to get myself off the prescription medications and have decided to try and purge the THC and the prescription medications from my system, because lately my sleep has been just terrible. 

I’m not sure if the bad quality (or downright lack) of sleep is attributable to developing a tolerance for the prescription medications but that’s my hunch.

So nearly 3 weeks ago, I stopped my daily use of weed cold turkey. Haven’t smoked at all since 7/6. 

I know what you’re thinking “well, pot should help you to sleep.” But for me, it was never that way and I found that it would often disrupt my sleep (especially if I nodded off for a half hour early in the evening and then attempted to sleep the entire night just a couple hours later).

I’m beginning to believe that stopping cold turkey after such heavy use is the reason my sleep sucks so much now. All I want to do is get my sleep back because without that, life just sucks and I’d rather give up weed for good if it means finally being able to sleep the night through.

If I can get my sleep back, I may reintroduce weed back into my life, but I have noticed that I’m not as moody since I stopped, despite the lack of sleep.

PS: I am an active member for on the insomnia Reddit but haven’t gotten a lot of help on this subject there so decided to try this board.

I should also add that my weed use was 99% solo. The only times I smoked with others was an occasional visit with HS friends and on my annual business trip to Amsterdam when I enjoyed getting high with coworkers (and even my boss, occasionally!)

So I’m going to brain dump here to help myself and to connect with anyone else who might relate.

I’ve smoked off an on for the last 10 years. This last bout lasted a solid year of smoking all day every day. It’s the only way I’ve know to treat my CPTSD. 

In the past, that amount of consumption has had me going to the ER for CHS, only to learn what CHS is and quit cold turkey in 2018.

During this past year, I hacked my biochemistry to avoid CHS, or at least stay in the prodromal phase for as long as possible. This was done by eating copious amounts of capsaicin (hot peppers or hot sauce) with every meal in order to regulate my TRPV1 receptors. 

I started seeing a therapist again this past Fall of 2020. I’ve had many bad therapists previously, but this one has been incredible. They’ve helped me unpack my childhood traumas and pointed me in the direction of copious amounts of resources to thrive without pot.

This past week my wife and two boys all got COVID. Even though we were vaccinated, the virus broke through and got us. It triggered my immune response, giving me intense dysphoria, headaches, and diarrhea, but I never tested positive. The family is all nearing the end of their run with the virus but it’s been a stressful week!

Lastly, I’ve got a Disney trip planned for the fam in 40 days and I owe it to myself and my family to sober up. And truly, I’m ready to face down my demons without pot. 

So here I am, day 3, cramps 10/10, emotionally underwater, and sticking with it until it’s all behind me.

Psychology student here and I recently learnt a new concept which I found super interesting. 

The concept is called “self-handicapping”, sometimes also referred to as “self-sabotaging”.

“Self-handicapping has been commonly defined as actively seeking or creating situations which will interfere with performance and therefore create an explanation for possible failure outside of individual ability attributions” 

For example, say there’s a student who has a very important test the next day and they’re afraid they won’t do well. 
They might decide to join their friends and party the night before the test instead of revising. 
Why? 
So that when they get their grade back and see that they didn’t do well, their brain instantly goes “you didn’t do well because of your friends and that party” instead of “you didn’t do well because you’re not that intelligent and you have a poor work ethic”. 

Self handicapping serves as a means of protecting the fragile human ego by shifting the blame of any prospective failure onto external factors rather than internal ones. 
It serves to preserve our self esteem. 

Does this sound familiar? 

Allow me to give you another example, this time linked to weed. 

Say there’s a person who has had social anxiety their whole life. Since discovering weed, they’ve developed a habit of smoking before social gatherings. 
Logically, this makes no sense. Why would they use a substance that impairs social skills if they already have poor social skills?
The answer is simple. 
Without weed, their poor social skills will be internalised and become damaging to their self esteem. The individual will be painfully aware of their awkwardness and will therefore be more self conscious of how others perceive them, too. 
With weed, the person’s social awkwardness will be attributed to the fact that they’re high. They will be less self conscious too, because they know that everyone else knows they’re high and will therefore link the person’s poor social skills to the weed rather than them personally. 

After some thought, I realised that I use weed to self-sabotage so many different areas of my life. 
It’s a lot easier to live with yourself as a person when you shake off personal responsibility and instead find something in the world to blame. 

Yes, it’s so comfortable keeping myself wrapped in cotton wool. I make it through the day easier, I sleep better at night. 
But my life will never change if I continue like this. 10 years from now, I’ll either be stuck in exactly the same place or I’ll be in a worse place. 

The only way out is through. I need to unwrap the cotton wool, take a long hard look in the mirror, take responsibility for my actions, and finally reclaim control over my life.

Yesterday was rough as hell. 

Started off my day waking up from a dream that I had gotten high (too high, like uncomfortably, anxiety ridden high) and I was trying my damndest to keep my composure and try to hide it from my husband. 

Woke up, did my best to brush it off. Decided to hop on FB and do some mindless scrolling. Had a notification for a memory from last year; a picture I had taken of my son (4 at the time) and me at the lake. I remember that day vividly.

I was always one of those potheads that didn’t feel comfortable driving high, so instead I’d toke after arriving at my destination, ride it out and then drive home. In all honesty, prob still was high when I left somewhere.. but at the time I thought it was okay. Anyways, I took my 4yo to the lake near our house with his bike with plans of letting him ride around in the pathways/enormous parking lots. When we got there I hit my cart a *little* too much. Didn’t feel great being that stoned, in public, in the MORNING, with my kid but figured okay I’ll just ride it out and we’ll hang here until I sober up a bit. Fast forward MAYBE 5-10 min, 4yo is hot, over riding his bike and wants to go back home. Okay, reasonable.. except I’m high AF and I can’t get him there. I play it off like, “no we drove all the way out here and we’re going to spend time here.” Cue tantrum, cue me reacting irritably due to my own frustrations and guilt. Eventually we compromise on taking a walk, skipping some rocks, sitting by the lake talking. I snapped a pretty cute pic of us that day and posted it. But the memory isn’t cute.

Left me feeling all the feels. Worst of all? ALL I wanted to do was get high. Numb it out. Not feel what I didn’t want to feel. But I didn’t. Another day in the books.

I'm 36, and 21 days weed-free after four years of daily smoking and many more years of casual use. That beats all my records in the last four years, which were mostly abstinence through lack of availability traveling and such. I knew there was a problem when I realized I was stoned whenever I wasn't working. Then I got laid off last August, and wasn't sober and awake for more than a week since then. 

I'm riding out the nightmares which have been wild the last two weeks since dreams returned, but grateful my withdrawals have been mild. 

The following four reasons to quit have seen me through.

*Be present in my life*

A wise woman once encouraged me to live life with my eyes open, and not stumble through it as if through a darkened room. I'm finally ready to take this advice. 

*Be prepared for emergencies*

I want to be a person who makes things better and helps others when the shit hits the fan, but I have not been living up to that aspiration as a daily smoker. 

*Be stable in my moods*

I have bipolar disorder II. My brain is wicked sensitive and weed interferes with both my medication and the discipline I need to regulate without medication. I have to stop self medicating.

*Become a mother*

This is a life goal that is much harder with the point above, but in reality it's the reason that finally got me to quit. I have trouble feeling like I'm worth it in the present, but my future requires it.

I'm going to increase the number of times I walk my dog next week but I'm getting my second dose of vaccine so I'll see how it goes. Hopefully I don't relapse on weed like I did on my first dose.

I'm waiting for D2R to come out but that's in August so still weeks left. I'm bored af without playing any games as I'm unemployed atm. Also planning on going back to school which is September so another thing I'm waiting on.

I'm just hoping that I don't relapse between the waiting as I'm getting so much cravings and make my waits all worthless.

My mental game is all on ""tommorow will better"". ""One more day without weed is a victory"".

First of all, I want to thank this sub just for existing. 

I have been a “nights and weekends” weed smoker for about 7 years, and since the start of the pandemic I started smoking all the time while in Home Office. It does not help that I am a highly functional stoner (even my eyes were not turning red anymore). I even participated in video meetings completely high and never had an issue. 

I am a very active person, hitting the gym around 6x a week (or doing home workouts while in lockdown) but I felt my lungs getting worse and worse. I tend to breathe from my mouth by just walking normally (I am constantly sucking on my mask).

Then the amazing thing happened: a friend of mine invited me to join him and his family in a trip to a resort in Mexico, and I treated that as a forced rehab for 10 days. I left a little bit of weed back home for when I come back.

The trip itself was great and I almost did not crave weed at all except for the first 2 days. The change of scenary plus loads of new things to do kept me distracted and I was able to sleep well for my standards mainly due to fatigue of doing things on vacation.

I returned this monday, the 19th. I decided to chain smoke everything I had left and haven’t bought more since. So I guess I am 4 days clean but those 10 days in Mexico were the real eye opening ones.

I suffer from anxiety and mild depression, probably due to the serotonine being affected by weed and I have a very light sleep. My biggest problem right now is sleeping, I could only fall sleep stoned so it has been a challenge getting to bed before midnight. Yesterday I watched the Tokyo Olympics until 2am :(

My friend gave me a couple of non prescription drugs to help, I have been taking 1/3 every night, but it is not working. Instead it is just making me drowsy until noon the next day…

I have restless leg syndrome and its much worse than normal.

Overall its been a good week that I honestly did not think I could do it.

I am going to a psychiatrist tuesday next week to basically tell everything I am writing above. It will be my first time being completely honest about this matter with a professional so if you have any tips or anything to add that might help his diagnosis I welcome.

I would love to have a support group to Zoom sometimes. I am from Brazil but I speak very good english.

2021-07-24 20:25:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/or1fyt/for_those_starting/,For those starting,"Hello reader, my name is Mei and I have been ping-ponging the idea of posting something to this group for the past few days. To start off with a little background of myself, I was a heavy THC user from the year 2017 up until April of 2021. I was a heavy daily user, sometimes (like most) using multiple times per day. During my 'stint' I had lost a significant amount of weight, friends, life direction, and overall happiness. The reason I am here is to send out a message of hope to all of those who are just starting their newfound journey and for those considering the switch to sobriety, be it drinking, cigarettes, or MMJ. Some continued background information: I got a DUI (drinking) in the summer of 2019, I consumed cigarettes in a variety of ways from 2017-2020, and ultimately I drastically improved my life by my own choice.

So if you have read this far I would like to personally thank you for taking the time out of your day to do so, I promise you will learn something from this so don't stop now! It all started when I got my DUI in 2019, I was a fairly heavy drinker from the months of May through August (the month of my DUI) and through that time period I had experienced a whirlwind of different emotions and life changes. After I had gotten my DUI I knew that it was finally time to start making changes in my life, changes that would stick and follow me, changes that I ultimately wanted to make because I finally wanted a better life for myself. My DUI was my rock bottom, through drinking and other substance abuse, I have recently learned I was following the method of  'escapism' from any and all problems I came across. The biggest reason I wanted to change was the fear of further consequence, my DUI in total has costed me roughly $10,000.00 USD all inclusive, looking back people might say it's ""not a good enough reason"" to change or to purse a better life, but I say F\*ck that! Any reason to change is a good enough reason, and we as a society should not worry about the acceptance of our personal reasonings to become better people.

After leaving drinking behind, I continued on through COVID lockdown and the rest of the year with heavy MMJ and cigarette use, and as my lungs grew worse quality as time flew by, so did the quality of my life and the things I was experiencing. I became stagnant at video games, progression got harder, relationships and problems began to get trickier to navigate as I had no proper coping skills/problem solving skills built up. In some ways I believe I was 'coping' with the loss of one substance by substituting another one, I really thought I enjoyed MMJ, I thought it was really helping my anxiety. Ultimately my anxiety was becoming increasingly bad through the rest of 2020, I had quit for roughly a few days in December of 2020, only to go back shortly after. At the end of December 2020, I made a decision to quit nicotine for good. The first week sucked, and so did the second and the third but as this time away from now two substances grew, so did the consumption of MMJ.

So here we are at the main topic of this group MMJ, and my struggle to quit this substance. My struggle with using MMJ became increasingly hard after the new year due to the ability to obtain dispensary quality goods, at a moment's notice. I don't believe marijuana, specifically medical mmj is 'bad' and i do think there are people who benefit from it more medicinally than I was, but ultimately it was no longer for me. After repeated use of high concentrated doses, tons of different research of terpenes, and lots of misuse over the years, I started to realize that the effects that I thought were helping me were actually punishing me. I found my anxiety to become increasingly difficult to work with, it was affecting people around me along with activities I was agreeing to do, but once high i felt unable to complete normal daily tasks. It was hard because for a long time I tried the methods of self justification, everything from the fact I have ADHD, to the fact it's medicinal, to the licensure, to the rising legality around the plant. Ultimately, in my formative years instead of creating healthy coping mechanisms, I turned to substance to escape my problems and issues, which lead to never dealing with problems.

Fast forward three months, it is now late July and I am three months fully sober of Medical Marijuana, and almost 8 months sober of cigarettes. My life is great, I have been able to uncover some underlying mental health issues, I have fallen back into love with video games and other hobbies (I always loved the hobbies, but before it was more mindlessly enjoying things because of the visual amplification received from MMJ) and ultimately clear mindedness. I now have the power of choices, decisions, and responsibilities in my arsenal. I can finally set goals and stick to them, I can finally love myself for who I am, to accept my flaws and mistakes. Ultimately, I don't regret the time I was using substances. There are some experiences I wish I didn't have, but the way I work I think some of those needed to happen to get me where I am now.

My final tip of info I leave to all of the readers, don't fret about the time spent using substance, we made those decisions, and that's that. But think about the future, and be positive, pick up a new hobby, enjoy life for what it is.

I love you all - sorry for the weird paragraph structure, I have good ideas but bad sentence structure.

Honestly wasn’t planning on quitting. I mean, I have thought about it for years in that “eventually” sort of way. Usually like, “after this bag runs out I won’t get anymore”. I’ve had some small breaks in the past but obvi nothing permanent.  It’s odd how it happened. 2020 broke me, I lost 3 people to death (my childhood best friend to a hard narcotic addiction, both my grandma’s to general old age) and almost lost my mother to heart failure. I have been traumatized by all the fear and isolation and loss and have been stuck in a mental health all time low. Anxiety, suicide ideation, the whole bit. I noticed though that I actually stop craving weed when I am in the worst of it. When my mom went to the hospital with what looked like terrible covid symptoms that we found out was heart disease (which killed my grandpa at 60) I was terrified not knowing if she was gonna come back home and I didn’t smoke the entire time, I was too freaked out. Once things regulated a bit, I went back to smoking. This week I took another tumble into the mental health deep deep end, suicidal thoughts came back, extreme anxiety came back and I just thought “I don’t want this fucking weed in my life anymore. YUCK.” and haven’t smoked in two days. I’ve since then regulated emotionally a bit and am starting to breath easier and relax a little and suddenly I find myself craving again. Does anybody else experience this? I think it’s the association between coziness and getting stoned. Like if I’m feeling cozy, the addiction says weed will emphasize this when in reality it invokes paranoia and crippling self awareness.",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8524001}"

When I was smoking regularly it was really bad and I usually wouldn’t experience much joy from having an orgasm. Since quitting it’s gotten a lot better but it’s still really hard to get a full erection on my own. And a lot of the time I still have the same types of intrusive thoughts while I’m masturbating that prevent me from having a satisfying orgasm. It’s mainly the fear that I won’t have a satisfying orgasm itself that causes me not to have one. I’m 19 now and have had this problem since I was 15. I feel like I’d make a lot of progress if I had sexual opportunities but I’m scared that when I do I’ll disappoint the person by either not being able to have a full erection (which I like to think won’t happen) or cumming way too fast. But I know that if I had regular sexual interaction it would get a lot better. I’m posting this here to see if anyone else struggles with this and has any advice on how to heal from it.

I doubt the vast majority of y'all will be able to fuck up your life as much as I did with weed, but it's definitely possible and you should know the risks.

I'll start right before the pandemic kicked up, around February, since that's when I really started kicking up my usage to cope. I'm not really sure if I was more depressed at this time because I can't really remember much, but I would guess it was my seasonal depression that had me smoking every day. I started blowing off my schoolwork and smoking instead of going to class, and nobody really questioned it because college students don't think weed can be a problem.

 It was also around this time I started blowing off my girlfriend, which I still regret because it was a pretty good thing we had going on. As the pandemic started and we had to isolate, she started to get more clingy, but it was also probably because I was putting no effort into our relationship whatsoever. I definitely took her for granted, and surprise, come April we've broken up. I told her to her face I found her annoying and honestly didn't even think it was shitty because all I gave a shit about was smoking and watching random bullshit online. We're friends now but sometimes I can't help but wonder if shit would've worked out if I wasn't such a jackass.

Summer was pretty uneventful, just a continuation of the same shit I'd been doing the past couple months. I got on unemployment and didn't do shit but smoke. This was honestly a big mistake- not doing anything for months and months at a time makes it extremely hard to get back into the swing of things.

 I had to take an extremely difficult course at double speed online come September (still pandemic times), and it was at this point things really started going to shit. I was anxious as fuck all the time, high every single class period, and borderline suicidal because it was clear I was the least skilled in the class and dragging people down in group projects. I dreaded every single painful 2 hour class, and was probably sleeping 12-14 hours a day just to deal with it.

Come mid October when classes switched (due to really weird pandemic scheduling), I was so incredibly relieved that this class was over to find out I was just as fucked in another class because I blew off the prereq classes earlier that year and didn't know any of the building blocks. Not being able to deal, I just dropped the class and only did creative writing, essentially just falling back into my old habits of doing absolutely nothing.

At this point I was literally doing nothing but getting stoned and extremely anxious. I would start shaking from anxiety sometimes and think something was really wrong, come down, then get super stoned again the next day and think I might be dying or something stupid like that. But that is all I remember doing- I wasn't even watching any shows, I'd literally just get high and scroll my phone or stare at the ceiling until my anxiety went away. This went on from October to January.

This is where shit started getting really bad. Besides the stuff mentioned above, I started gambling a lot, and I was already spending more money on weed than groceries. I gambled away about a grand in a month if I was to guess, and didn't even give a shit because I still had enough money for weed. I also started making extremely risky investments which I'm stuck holding now because it isn't worth selling at a 30% loss since they're more or less at fair value now. Worst part is some of it is loan money that could've gone towards my education, and now I'm pretty financially fucked. My thoughts were really dark at this point, with the worst one being ""if I run out of money for weed or college I can just kill myself, because no way I'm going to be able to hold a job."" So yeah, that's where I was at for a few months. 

Come February I was borderline agoraphobic, and thought people looked at me like I was a freakshow every time I went outside or to a business. From February to June I probably left the house 5 times, 2 of which were to get vaccinated. It was also in February I started getting seriously bad shakes and terrible stomach issues whenever I smoked. The only thing that would give me relief was an extremely hot shower, which is textbook cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (look it up). Of course I was in denial that it could be the weed that was fucking my stomach up, and come March I was literally throwing up every day and showering 3 times a day because I kept waking and baking. Sometimes I'd have the epiphany that it was the weed, then would forget the next day because I was stoned and sick as shit and focusing on that. I couldn't keep food down at all and lost 10-20 pounds in the span of a couple weeks.

In late March of 2021 I ""took a T break"" meaning my dealer was giving me a hard time and I didn't want to deal with it. Did I mention I also was stealing weed from my friends and roommates at this point? Yeah, great guy I was being. But anyways my symptoms started to ease up and instead of vomiting all day, it was only in the mornings. Of course the second I got more weed I forgot this, and for another month I kept throwing up until early May of this year.

At this point I was genuinely trying to quit, but it wasn't until the last week of May that I got more than 5 days without smoking. I was extremely sick, super pissed all the time, and my brain was so foggy that listening to someone speak and responding was near impossible. I'd just use generic responses like ""yeah"" or ""damn"" depending on their tone of voiceand hope it was good enough to pass (I'm still having difficulty with this now). Come early June I was extremely emotional every day due to withdrawal, and was crying every day and having suicidal thoughts a few times a day.I literally had to stop driving for a while because the urge to veer into traffic was scaring me. I also get panic attacks now, so that's great, granted they've slowed down a lot since the thc has made its way out of my system. 

2 weeks sober and I was so unstable I decided to buy a plane ticket for the next day back to my parents house, knowing I wouldn't be able to smoke there. I said it was just because I couldn't find a job, which was true, but it was definitely because I was too emotional and high to get one. The one interview I went to was super exhausting- I literally puked in the back alley before going in because I knew I couldn't go that long without puking due to my cannabinoid hyperemesis. When I got in the hiring manager wasn't even there, so dead end. My mom was really worried because she could tell my mental state had declined and heard me puking a lot, which I just said had been happening a while and that I would go to a doctor if it persisted.

A week of being home and I got an email saying I'd gotten the job back where my college was. I was planning on staying with my parents the whole summer, but considering it was a decent job I impulsively flew back the following week and have been working 40 hour weeks since. At first I was super anxious because I honestly thought they'd fire me or I'd be too sick to go in a lot of days. Luckily by this point I'd been about 20 days sober and my puking was getting less and less frequent, and I was able to hide it my first week. By my second week on the job I had stopped puking almost entirely so long as I avoided triggers like alcohol or too much sugary food. 

The suicidal thoughts have unfortunately stayed, but are a lot more subdued, and so did my shitty finances of course. Right now I'm trying to work out if I'm going to be able to pay for my next semester or if I'll have to take some time off school to work, and I'm about 70% sure I'll be able to secure the extra aid I need and make enough money working to do so. People at work think I'm smart but quiet, and I've been pretty reliable so they seem to like me well enough, which is good. Honestly it's gone a long ways in building my self confidence back up, and these past couple weeks I've even started to get to know some people. 

I do regret jumping back into things so fast though- 40 hours a week and a summer course (free due to pandemic so couldn't pass it up) while trying to live on your own for the first time is kind of insane and stressful, but hey I'm doing it. My brain also feels like it's finally losing some of the fog that's been there for a while, and I can actually tell you what I ate yesterday now so that's an improvement. Honestly I can't even imagine going back to how I was living- no wonder my anxiety was so bad and I absolutely despised living, I was sick and completely isolated and left with my thoughts for months. It gives me chills just thinking about how horrible it was. Don't get me wrong, I still have the urge to smoke, but the fear overpowers any addiction I had. I have my roommate hide hers now because I just don't even want there to be a chance I go back to it, that's how scary the thought is to me. I just want to spend the next few months recovering, graduate, and then go from there, and I'm fine doing that sober.

Hopefully this at the very least was an interesting read- I'm pretty sleep deprived as always (weed always put me to sleep and now I actually have to learn good habits), so my apologies if the grammar isn't good or it's hard to follow my train of thought. If you're struggling with your mental health, I guarantee you weed is making it worse. I didn't even realize how bad I was struggling because of my usage, so hopefully this can give you some perspective if you're struggling as much as I was.",13,{'pandemic': 5},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.80366725}"

I'm strongly considering quitting but have the issue of strong addictive tendencies and tend to use cannabis as a crutch just to get over anxiety, sleep deprivation, and, honestly, just through my days most of the time. In the past when I've tried to quit for long periods of time I would often replace the euphoria/comfort from smoking with eating which is how I used to deal with my emotions growing up. 

I'm trying very hard to steer clear of further self-sabotage and I want to indulge in habits that build my discipline and benefit me rather than take me down a path of induced euphoria/reward with nothing to show for it.

I've started reading more books (which apparently still exist, WHO KNEW!) and I'm trying to convince myself to lose weight by exercising but admittedly I'm lazy which is nothing new for a stoner but I also fear I'll fall into bad habits to seek familiar comforts when the anxiety sets back in after quitting.

I'm quite habitual so the drug itself wasn't as addictive to me as it would be to others, I wasn't trying to escape anything, I just simply enjoyed myself and got into a routine of it, one or two cones (Australia, so like 1/3 of a bowl for you big bowl smoking Americans). So when I finally put the bong down I didn't really think twice about it for about 3 weeks. Since then I went on holiday for a week and smoked a fair bit in the evenings, it's been a week since that holiday and I haven't thought about it or smoked once. In essence everything is very under control. (Although in saying that, the need to declare it does throw up red flags).

Now the thing here is, I'm a software developer, absolutely love it and would find it hard to leave my computer when I smoked. I just had so many ideas and so much motivation to continue working on the next project whilst I was stoned. Since quitting I don't do anything, I read my phone and watch TV. I've tried going for walks, keeping my house clean and all that but I still don't want to touch my computer or work on any of my projects that I was so passionate about a month ago. I don't feel depressed by any means, I know what that's like when you first stop, been there done that, this time was different.

Also, I recommend making a list of phrases that you calm yourself with before you break down and smoke a joint. Once they are on paper, they begin to sound like a joke. Reread them several times and you will no longer be able to use them and get trapped on these mines. I wrote on paper all the phrases, that I’m telling myself before smoke joint. After I wrote it, I understood that this is absurd, weakness and shit. Here is examples: 

- After everything I've been through, I deserve it 
- I'm a Lion on recreation 
- If I lived in the USA, I would be discharged as a needy person
- It's not as deadly as other drugs or even alcohol 
- I do not feel any direct harmful consequences from the use of marijuana
- The herb helps me to suppress emotions
- My lifestyle may be different from the lifestyle of other people, because I am special 
- I have nothing to lose 
- Someday I will deal with this, but today is the day for this 
- I don't feel uncomfortable because I'm not on one wave with the guys 
- I need to smoke to eat 
- I need to smoke to fall asleep 
- Videos and TV shows will be much more interesting if I smoke 
- I have a lot more, why not 
- In order to feel comfortable and not get annoyed by people, I need to smoke 
- I do not have worthy people for spending time together, I will spend it with grass and with great pleasure 
- You need to let nerves chill
- I'm just such a person 
- I just need it 
- It's just not given to others, I'm special and I can afford it as a genius 
- fuck it
- The fact that I smoke does not mean that success will bypass me 

How wonderful it would be if we didn't have to pay for most of the undesirable actions. However, almost immediately after indulging our whims, our words follow: ""I shouldn't have eaten so much"", ""I shouldn't have spent so much money"", ""I shouldn't have smoked that joint"", ""I shouldn't have worried so much"".  In other words: ""I shouldn't have allowed one part of me to completely take control of me. This part is like a demon that is beyond my control.""

Anyone else struggling to figure out your mental health diagnosis because smoking seems to have changed you?,"I'm struggling to not totally shame spiral over the fact that studies show prolonged weed use can cause a permanent decrease in dopamine levels. I'm 26 and began smoking regularly when I was 18. Mental illness runs in my family, so it was no surprise when I started feeling social anxiety and low moods as a teen. I was in a huge transition period, lost a lot of friends & community when I moved to a new city alone for college. To cope with this (probably normal response to my situation), I started smoking & self isolating. It was an easy way to relax, and a social activity everyone around me was into.

Now my life as completely fallen off the rails. Every time I try to stop smoking, I go a few months before my anxiety/intense moods/executive dysfunction (literally being stuck) start acting up and I relapse. The problem is, I can't tell if the anxiety was there before the weed, or if it created the anxiety. Same with the ADHD symptoms I've struggled with since I started smoking - executive dysfunction (being stuck in bed, not doing important tasks or hobbies for no reason), not texting people back, being late to everything, forgetting important dates, not being able to finish school or hold down jobs, chronically distracted, disorganized, sensitive to external stimuli like sounds and smells. Those symptoms all sound exactly like the negative side effects of smoking. They also are the expected symptoms of a woman with late-diagnosis ADHD/ADD.

I guess at this point I'm wondering if it even matters what did this to me, as long as I get treatment. It's been too long for me to remember if I had symptoms as a child. It just feels so lonely and difficult to figure these things out when the general culture of psychiatry & psychology is to either consider weed a helpful medicine and ignore the fact that some of us do get dependent on it, or to just ignore it altogether. I've had a doctor tell me it's normal to smoke every day, and another tell me it's my fault so many medications aren't working because I just refuse to quit smoking. I've never had a problem quitting drinking or cigarettes.

I'm on day 4 of trying for the miillionth time to quit forever. I've been unemployed for a year and a half  and the pandemic has had me couch-locked, stoned, and deeply depressed the entire time. At this point I can't wait any longer to get my life together, I went from being a high achieving gifted child involved in every extra-curricular who got scholarships to top schools, to a dropout with no career or money or friends who rarely leaves the house. I'm starting an ADHD medication tomorrow while I wait for an official evaluation. I guess I'm just wondering if there's any one else out there as confused about this as I am.

EDIT: I realize I worded the title weirdly. I should have said ""It FEELS like I gave myself ADHD"". I understand that ADHD is something you typically have from childhood. Hence my confusion.",92,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.77099603}"

Just now I'm finally coming to terms with how far I can trick myself to continue consuming. I've been and on-and-off consumer for about 8 years. I've quit for months at a time with no major issues but when I fall back my dependency grows considerably. COVID really slammed the breaks on my plans for the future so I've been pretty much binge-smoking since March 2020. Around 4 months ago I got fed up and said I'd quit ""smoking joints""... so I moved to cartridges, 6 weeks after that I said I'd quit cartridges... and started smoking herb on a coil. 2 weeks ago I said I'd quit smoking all together... only to start consuming edibles. Every single time my brain just said ""it's ok because the high is different"" and ""it's not the high that's bad, it's the way you take it"", along with many other comments on why it made sense not to quit altogether. Yesterday I overdid it with the edibles. I woke up with a severely upset stomach and I've been on the toilet purging out of both ends.   
  
This is not the first time my consumption has left me in such a pathetic state, but I'm finally holding on to this as a wake up call. The idea of committing to NOT consuming EVER AGAIN was always daunting but with nothing but suffering this past months, I can now get why it's not that bad. I had my fun.

I would smoke about a bowl a night out of the bong. The negatives weren’t very obvious at first. They emerged so gradually that I didn’t realize it until I was deep into the habit. Weed started to make me get consumed in negative thoughts and emotions. These thoughts and emotions would start to slowly turn me against family and friends and make me feel paranoid. My motivation to really work hard to become something in this world gradually faded because I had no energy anymore. I became content with working an ordinary job and coming home and getting high. It also made activities I normally enjoyed seem boring unless I was stoned. I eventually realized that using weed kept me from becoming the best version of myself and that something had to change.

A big kicker for me, was challenging myself to go 2-3 weeks without it just to see what it was like. After a couple days, I noticed my mind would remember/romanticize the first euphoric hour of being high, and forget about the following two days where I felt like a depressed shell of a person. After a week or so of sobriety, my clarity, positivity, and presence came back and it felt like I woke up from a dream. I resolved at that point to give up my habit in pursuit of living the best life I could. It wasn’t easy though. 

I fell back into the trap of smoking and getting sober again and again. Eventually I realized the reason I kept relapsing was because I kept listening to the thoughts and feelings/urges that tried to get me to smoke. It hit me that the thoughts/feelings are only thoughts and they have no actual power over me unless I let them. I had a choice to not listen to them and choose the path I wanted in life. After a month I felt completely back to my old self. My happiness, social life, and clarity was back and stronger than ever! I met an amazing girl who is now my wife and I feel more fulfilled than I ever have. I didn’t realize how much of life I was missing out on while living in a haze. I’ve been sober just over two years now and I’m not looking back.

I'm J, a high functioning weed addict. I'm 36 years old and have been smoking every day for about 18 years, except when I'm on vacation. I have a STEM PhD and my papers have hundreds of citations, and in addition I am CTO of a STEM-heavy start-up I co-founded. I am happily married to the beautiful, witty, sharp, and kind woman of my dreams. I'm physically fit; I run a sub one hour 10k, and those vacations, when I don't smoke, are typically 1-2 months per year spent doing yoga, hiking, cycling or mountain climbing somewhere beautiful. I speak five languages, play two musical instruments, and win more than I lose when playing online video games with my friends.

""So J, you sound like a successful man. What brings you here?""

I vape 2-3g of fairly potent stuff per week, mostly at night (down from 3-4g when I used to smoke). It *always* feels nice. But then at night after my wife goes to bed, I burn another bowl and space out in front of youtube, watching video game streams, or re-runs of old sitcoms, until 2, 3, 4am, when I go to bed. I wake up pretty late feeling guilty about it.

""But J, you say your work output is good, and your colleagues and collaborators are OK with you not schedulign meetings before noon. What's the problem?""

You see the thing is, my reasonable life makes it extremely difficult to argue with the demon. I'm not in control of this, not even a little. Countless days I've woken up saying ""Today, no"" only to light up at night. It's hard to argue with the inner junky reminding you ""but it feels soooo good, and there's nothing else to do right now anyway"". There's nothing to do, because this is all I want to do. I am totally missing out. Missing out on mornings, missing out on evenings out. Not that I'm a big go-out-to-bars person, but a beer in the park in the summer is lovely, and I'd prefer to go home so I can toke up and watch video game streams? Sad.

Countless days I've said ""tonight, I wont smoke. Only tonight. Just for one day."" only to predictably fail. For years this has been going on. At least once a week I break such a promise to myself. Even more pathetically, I can't count the times I've decided not to buy any more tomorrow, after I finish my stash today - only to call my guy *during the day* the next day, not even waiting til evening when I'm going to hit it.

I know what I need to do. I know that I should break this cycle of addiction. I spend a month or two off the weed on vacation every year and have a wonderful time, going to bed a bit earlier, waking up a bit more energetic, reading more books, socializing more. I know this can only happen as long as I don't have it in the house. It's stronger than me if it's at hand, I know that. But I can't bring myself to decide that now is the time. It's really hard to argue with the demon when he is right - weed feels *SO* good, and my life is great, so can't I afford this one tiny indulgance?

Thanks for reading. I'd love to read your comments. I plan to spend more time on this forum until I hopefully get the motivation to take the difficult step somehow. Keep up the good work, amigas and amigos.

I initially came into the program with no intention of sobriety but my intentions quickly changed also as accepting I at least had to stay sober for a bit as they drug test pretty much all drugs in existence daily.  I kind of realized how much weed and hiding from my problems and insecurities has fucked me over and how now the thought of sobriety scares me to death. 

Last school year I went into highschool with some shitty friends and went to school high the first day and threw up because I got very anxious and had an awful breakfast and pretty much was avoided by everyone for the rest of the school year because they thought I was weird because of that (sorta small private school btw). The friends I had went there with just constantly talked shit about me and were awful to me but I didn't have a lot of friends so i put up with it. I had never had trouble making friends before this and overall I'm not like a super shy person so this was hard for me. 

I came from a very very small school before this(30 kids in the grade) so its not like I had loads of other friends before this. At this highschool I was very socially anxious because of the throw up thing and thought people were always judging me for it and looking at it from a logical perspective it was probably just the anxiety talking but a lot of the people I did try talking to and stuff just didn't seem to intrested in being friends with me since I didn't know loads of other people and I just sort of got the vibe these people valued things like class and athleticism and my family is just middle class really and didn't have all these ""prestigious"" things the other people had like country clubs etc. 

Sorry for kind of over elaborating on that, I just had to get it out of my system really, but point being I got pretty depressed and latched onto weed for an escape of everything in my life. I got to the point where I was smoking constantly and there was only a few hours of sobriety throughout the day. I really do want to fully stop but its just really hard for me I feel as without it i just don't get as much enjoyment out of life(which I know is a lie just hard to get past) and lots of role models and and social media influencers I support act like weed is harmless and nothing is wrong with it and it just fucks with me sometimes. All of my social media is also just fluttered with this shit and its so hard to just get out of my brain and because of this I'm always changing my perspective on weed. 

I was 2.5 weeks sober and then just 2 days ago I had a really rough night the day before and found a little crumble of weed and smoked it and got a little high and figured it didn't matter since it was still in my system anyways and now I'm back at square one. I also know a lot of you guys might say ""hey you're in a program why do you need our help?"" but I just find personal advice coming from people  in the same footsteps as me to just be a lot more helpful. Anyways if theirs any tips or anything helpful you guys could offer on relapse prevention or anything that would be very helpful. Thanks.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7821681}"

But my addiction was so bad that I just brushed it off. But I decided that enough was enough and I decided to go cold turkey in order to advance further in my life and my professional career. I am a functioning addict and it baffles me sometimes how I advanced in life with these habits.

I find that I am dreaming again which I missed dearly. I am forming better sentences which for so long I dismissed weed as the cause for my stuttering.

But thats what addiction is. Its for life. And i still regret starting. 

But preserving then and now has been the best decision in my life. Since then, i have been able to meet my now wife, take care of a dog that is so damn cute and now get myself enrolled in a PhD program. I would never have done all this without quitting. When i was smoking, i had social anxiety, was in debt because of weed, and was on the verge of failing university. 

Weed really stopped me from achieving my potential. But once i stopped i really saw what i could really achieve. But i want to say its not easy, quitting has been one hardest thing i have done. But the process of quitting has made me stronger and wiser in my life. It showed me that if i could do it, i could do many things. 

So i just want to say, i know its tough. I know what its like to relapse and beat yourself up. But i also know what its like to pick yourself up and move forward.

I don’t have who to talk with about this, so I hope you can give me your point of view on this.

First, I’ll give you some context. I started smoking 4 years ago, at my 25, influenced by me (first of all), a few friends and later on by an ex boyfriend (weed was a great way to relate to each other). A year on smoking almost daily I had a panic attack that ended up with derealization feeling and insane anxiety and paranoia. 

I live with my brother who’s a heavy smoker since before I started, and it was hard for me to quit while being with him. So I kept doing it. I always was this sparkling person with the need to do things all the time, I used to have a YouTube channel, so Stand Up Comedy, have shows, and a digital community that grew at the velocity of my career. Weed helped me realize the struggles I had inside and that lead me to have that personality that needed so much attention (childhood and parent issues and traumas + being gay in a South American country).

But at some point it was too much. It was messing up my memory, capacity to focus, both very important to maintain my job. Plus, anxiety and fog sensation was unnecessary to me. So after trying and trying a lot, I quit successfully.

It’s being more than two months, and even though cravings visit me every once in a while when my brother smokes around or I have a bad day, I’m very committed with this journey and proud of where I am. I’m very persistent with the goals I ambition for myself and also this community has filled me with strength to stay focused.

The reason why I’m writing right now is because getting to the two months has been different. Anxiety is gone, only if I think of it I can barely feel something, but nothing like it was before. Clarity is more and more every week, to the point I’m starting to realize where weed mentally had me. How much I isolate myself, felt paranoid and had a different reality in my mind. And that hurts a bit. Makes me think of the time I lost. 

The thing is I don’t know if I got to the point where I’m at my 100% or if I ever be again that person I was 4 years ago. I’m close to me 30’s and of course we change, grow up and mature. I’m still figuring out whats me being  and adult and what’s me being numb and emotionless. 

I’m also dealing with fatigue from my job (I’m tired of it but concerned cause there’s a rent to pay and I don’t live in my country, so don’t have family support or anything), and I’m starting my transition. After all I wasn’t a gay boy, but a trans woman.

So a lot is going on and I had a couple of bad mental weeks and wanted to come here to rant and try to find some support. If you got to this point, thanks for reading me and good luck to all in your journeys💕",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45752108}"

I had been an everyday smoker for about 8 years, and never thought that something like that could happen to anyone, let alone me.

It’s hard to put into words what the manic episode was like, but believe me when I say that cannabis-induced psychosis is a very real thing when you’re smoking an eighth a day; it resulted in an intervention by my family/friends and landed me in the psych ward for a week, which is where I started on the path to recovery. I went through a long period of denial that substances were the source of my problem, I believed that grief over the death of my dad the prior year was the source of my erratic behavior. I then spent 3 months in sober living, where I began to see the truth on the major adjustment that I needed to make- getting clean.

Now it took awhile for me to admit I was an alcoholic as well, as I’ve never blacked out or gotten a DUI or anything like that, but it was very apparent that I was abusing weed in the same way that alcoholics abuse alcohol. Although it’s not for everyone, AA has been incredibly helpful in uncovering a lot of my fears/resentments and doing away them. Confronting those has done a surprising amount for alleviating my desire to get high, and although I many times feel out of place at AA meetings, I learned early on that many feel that way.

I wanted to thank r/leaves specifically for offering a discourse related to quitting weed.

Throughout this time, I did a lot of soul-searching and introspection. Upon my return, I decided it was time to sober up. I have been a regular smoker for about a decade now, and in the last few years, I never had more than a few days without smoking. I am one of those people that decides to take a break, but after a few days I get so stressed that I fail. 

After going on this trek, I decided that this was the beginning of a great change for me, and if I am capable of climbing mountains, then I am capable of anything. I also really want to get past my loop of dead end jobs, and I had been given a few offers that required a hair follicle test that goes back 90 days. So with this motivation and feeling stronger and more confident than ever before, it was time.

I have to say: it was tough. Upon returning to civilization, my brain underwent immense shock. Hearing cars and seeing people everywhere put an emotional strain on my mental state, and the lack of stars in the sky at night here made me depressed. I would wake up not knowing where I was for my first few moments, and falling asleep was nearly impossible for a couple weeks. I am not really sure how much of this was actually compounded by the fact that I wasn't smoking, but I imagine it didn't help.

So hear I am, 3 weeks sober, and doing pretty well overall. I think that choosing to quit while undergoing a lifestyle change probably made it much easier to not think about weed. I was a mess, but very rarely did I sit here thinking ""man I really wanna get high right now"". My main problem at this point is boredom.

Now I know there are a ton of hobbies to undertake, and I am searching, but my motivation to begin is just not there. I can't really get into video games and guitar like I had most of my life, but I think part of my enjoyment in these areas was heavily linked to my habit. Now when I try to do them, I just don't enjoy it like I used to.

I really want to get into writing like I did through my childhood, and even have some really good plots to write some short stories on, but I don't feel like starting on them. If I don't find something to dive into and truly enjoy, I'm worried I might get a slip of weakness and lose all of my progress, so I could really use some tips to regain my motivation.

I started smoking after I was exposed to it at my first job, a fast food job. I was 15. I never really used it heavily until my junior-becoming-senior summer break in high school, when I got a dab pen. I started using heavily as a crutch for all the issues in my life. I have aspergers and felt alienated from most people, and on top of that I started feeling useless. My grades were slipping in school, I was lazier, and mentally I was spiraling downward and I wanted to die. I was uncomfortable with my sexuality, with my weight and looks, with everything about myself.

But on March 9th, 2020, I decided to make two changes. I’d stop drinking soda and try and diet, and I’d stop smoking. And 500 days later, I’m 50 pounds lighter and healthy, both physically and mentally.

It was really hard because it was right when the pandemic was picking up, and I didn’t have something to hide my issues away with, or that thing to pass the time. But it allowed me to learn a lot about myself, and how to be a healthier person. I don’t hide my problems away in a blunt or a dab pen anymore. I can face my issues head on now. I am more confident, physically healthier, just everything I thought I could never be two years ago. I may have my host of issues still, but I am dealing with them a lot healthier now. And I’m beyond grateful for that ability.

It's been a long, long time, hasn't it? 

In that time I relapsed so hard it was scary. Back to daily bonging. Sometimes during the day even.

It got real and it got real pretty quick.  When I think about it I could have afforded a monthly installment for a decent car with my monthly weed spend.

I have been trying to quit for the last two years. I went to rehab at one stage to do it. The longest I have managed clean is 6 months.

Then people started rioting and looting in my area for a week and I couldn't go out and I couldn't get weed. 

Before that I was thinking of stopping due to how tired I was all the time and how I never could seem to get high even though I was going through 10-15 grams by myself in a week. 

Also I started noticing my cough was not going away and everytime i woke up I would have black like things in my spittle. Perhaps my lungs were trying to tell me something. 

So I stopped smoking during the rioting week and smoked once, last Saturday after sourcing a small bit.

Things have settled down, the weed dealers and stores are open again and I have money to get weed. The thing is I can't or don't want to be that way anymore.

I can't be caught unawares and down and out like that again. I need to have my wits about me and have my physical strength, in case things get real again and we have to go back to defence mode. 

I guess I finally realised I can't hold myself back like this. The stakes are too high now and I don't want to fail because of my own stupid habit and inability to control myself. 

I haven't bought weed and it's been a week I think (barring that slip up Saturday past). 

I don't know what to say. I'm just amazed that this is going this way.

Today was a tough day and I got really stressed out at work. But I didn't reach for it. I knew it would not help fix or sort things out. 

And things need to get sorted out ASAP. Lest the instability returns and the threats and the like. Need to be ready and smoking everyday ain't gonna allow that to happen",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7097744}"

I have a lot of health issues and I can't work out, so I feel incredibly guilty for eating and end up purging. constantly body checking.

I have a bunch of treatment resistant infections and I can't go to the doctor because my job is understaffed and there's no one to cover me so I have to wait over a month to get help

I am working at a new job and somehow It's so hard. 40 hours a week seems pretty standard and it pays pretty well, but after every zoom session I just cry because of the pressure. 

I also have bipolar disorder so it's really easy for me to get out balance. once I'm done with work I get really hyper and I can't sleep.

I think my main issue is I'm really really lonely. My only friend just moved away and I'm really feeling the distance. I tried dating apps but I'm too scared and my infections make it impossible to really do anything anyway. I really need a friend and I really hate myself. 

this is the longest I've ever gone without weed and I have no Idea how I did it. I'm just depressed and wishing I didn't isolate myself so much. I just can't trust anyone because of all the abuse I experienced growing up I hate feeling sorry for myself but I have lost so much.

“..and by either grade I was in therapy three times a week - and the truth is.. Weed is the only thing that could ever balance me out”

Just because I’ve had success in life while smoking weed everyday doesn’t mean that smoking everyday is at all helping me. I don’t even know what else I’m capable of because I haven’t let go of a crutch I’ve leaned on for so long. I’m ready to walk, then run and do it on my own. 

---

I’ve always been labeled as “13 going on 30” growing up and now well into my 30’s, I’ve built a fabulous career and life for myself and family. I lived a privileged life, free of hardships many others face, but also worked very hard to reach a high level position in my field. All the while, starting in college, I was constantly saying “Yeah, I smoke everyday but I’m high functioning and I just need it to slow my brain down to chill.” I took this to heart and I’m now realizing that this was such a defeatist attitude and it put a cap on my full potential or at least in enjoying more of what life has to offer. 

I’m on day 9 of quitting weed after 13 years of daily smoking. I’ve had short stints of sobriety, almost always under the motivation of a “tolerance break.” This time is different. My life is different and my goals are different. This is the move I need to make to better myself and so far I am absolutely thrilled with how I feel.

I’m finding myself:

* Reading more
* Not needing to smoke away the day’s stresses but process them
* Thinking and planning further ahead in the future
* Calling my Mom after work because I’m not stoned immediately after getting off
* Doing projects I’ve put off for months or years

This is just the start and I’m excited to build better and better habits to make more of the above happen and add to the list. Yes, I’m dealing with some initial anxiety and slight cravings but this time around it’s so much easier because I want sobriety so much more now that it isn’t a break. I’m thinking about it as a permanent change. 

7 years ago I quit smoking cigarettes after 12 years of smoking. The thing that worked best for me was counting each and every day. Each morning I would write the number of days without a smoke on a whiteboard in big bubbly numbers that I colored in and had fun with. The morning I erased 37 and went to 0 felt so bad that I never went back. I stopped after 180 because I didn’t need it anymore. Now, I’m on day 9 with weed, my last vice, and I look forward to this 7 year anniversary feeling as good as that of my cigarette anniversary.

So I hadn't consumed cannabis in any form for *decades*, and then a few years ago someone passed a j on a camping trip.

A week ago or so she told another coworker in front of me that I was getting sober, using an app to track my progress, and laughed about it. When the other coworker said oh I didn't know you had a problem. My ""friend"" laughed and said, she doesn't. Then this past weekend she told me a huge lie about her baby granddaughter. I called her out for it and she tried to circle around it and make up excuses. I have been avoiding her but decided last night to ask if she wanted to talk. I told her what was bothering me and she continued to lie and make excuses while apologizing and telling me she didn't mean to hurt me. I'm so confused and angry.

I’ve been smoking since I was 15.
I’m 21 now, and it just feels like most of my adult life has been trying to get weed.

I’ve tried to understand it a hundred different ways, but there’s just this undying desire to be stoned, even when my whole life is falling apart.

Recently hit rock bottom I think, car was broken, didn’t have money to fix, didn’t have money for food. Had to catch a ride with mum to work every day, and she bought all the food this week.

Decided to quit again, made it a week, then relapsed with a j, made it three days and then relapsed with an edible.

Almost completely relapsed, pay check is coming on Saturday and I have been planning how to get more weed, even though I can’t afford it.
I was planning how to grow it, where I’d smoke it, who I’d get from, how much I’d spend.

It felt inevitable, like the decision was made and there was no going back.
Then I came on here, and started writing replies to people’s posts.
Suddenly I wasn’t just another hopeless stoner, I was someone who’s been practicing quitting for 6 years.

All the advice I had been given, I gave, and it reminded me why I want to quit.

To be brave, to know I tried to be myself.
To truly feel the happy moments and the sad.
To love fully, and give to others honestly.
To feel calm and happy knowing that I’m not gonna start coming down in a couple of hours.
To actually save some money for once, money I can use to make my life, and the lives of the people I love better.

I know it’s going to be hard, but we couldn’t know the light without trying to see in the dark. Tomorrow I know I’m going to wake up and start planning again, planning for my high.

But coming here and talking to you guys gives me strength.

But, coming back to weed. The attention our mind gives to things has improved 10 times. Like back then even when I try to focus on something, on the back of my mind I'm always wondering when I'll smoke my next joint. So I wasn't fully present in the moment.

And, I've started to meditate after quitting smoking pot and learning a thing or 2 about mindfulness.

This sobriety is giving me more pleasure than smoking a joint.

I’ve always had vivid dreams that I can recall ever since I was a child but it’s normally not every night, just periodically. Over covid lockdown, I got back into smoking very heavily (previously, I had smoked a lot through college but then smoked very little periodically through the past five years or so). Coming off this lockdown habit (I mean let’s just call it an addiction I guess) was a lot harder for me and I did experience a lot of withdrawal symptoms that I never had experienced before. Now that I’m past the physical withdrawals and cravings, I’m just wondering what others’ experiences have been like with dreaming and how long it will last/if there’s anything I can do to help deal with it?

I started smoking nightly at 18, after all my priorities were taken care of during the day. I was responsible with it, but it turned into a self destructive habit very quickly. 

When I turned 19, my girlfriend and I (both 22 F) got our own place together. We smoked weed all day every day, other than when we had class and whatnot. It was great, I felt that it helped open my mind and reduce anxiety- whatever I had to tell myself. Half way through that year my gf stopped smoking because she began having panic attacks pretty much every time she got high. I continued smoking, and it began to get in the way of my priorities. Weed became my priority, I had been smoking daily for over a year and was unknowingly very dependant. 

I didn’t know you could become dependant because a lot of the stoner community believes that its harmless, as many of you know. For me this wasn’t the case. I couldn’t even take a T break, because if I stopped smoking the world would end. When I was sober, my anxiety and depression were through the roof. I became irritable and was becoming a totally different person. 

When COVID hit all I did was smoke weed, morning to night. I got a job during the summer of 2020 and continued with this routine of spending all of my free time smoking until about September 2020 when I decided I had enough. I quit for a week, the longest I’d gone without smoking in 2 years. After my week of quitting, I was at a party and my friend offered to share a joint with me. I thought hell, it’s just one joint so we smoked it and I immediately fell back into the cycle the following week. I was giving into triggers left and right, making up whatever excuses I could to continue smoking. 

As 2021 rolled around I was back to smoking every night and all day on weekends, and last month I finally had enough. I was tired of relying on substance to feel content, tired of having foggy thoughts, not remembering my dreams, being irritable, anxious and depressed while sober. Tired of my brain looking for weed as a reward after any task instead of actually focusing on the task at hand. Tired of not being able to eat or sleep without weed, and only craving junk food while high. I used to be a very active, healthy person, but while I was smoking I quit working out because the depression got so bad that I just couldn’t, even though it’s something I used to enjoy every day. 

I’m currently 2.5 weeks off weed and I’m feeling very heavy but I know I’ll get through it. I am medicated for my depression which I know will help. I went to the gym for the first time in over a year today and have been much more productive while sober. It hasn’t been easy and I do crave it a ton, there are times where I almost give in, especially at night. But I know I have to stay strong because the people who love me can not stand to see me like this, and I want to be the best person I can be for them. I love weed and how helpful it is for some people, but it just wasn’t working for me any more, I have no intentions to start smoking again. 

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this, and for providing a safe space to share my story.

I am just putting this out there to see if anyone can give their experience/thoughts in relation to an issue I am experiencing at the moment. 

I smoked weed (daily smoker) for around 5 years, I quit around late last year. Ever since I quit I have been experiencing short term memory loss (and some long term memory loss), basically, everything I did when I was high I cannot recall very well and now everything I do in the present (being sober) I cannot recall very well either. If you asked me what I did yesterday I would need to really to think about it and sometimes I just cannot remember, I remember the obvious - like that I worked or it was the weekend but I can't remember what I actually did. This is really bugging me out because when I smoked I didn't have this issue and definitely did not think this would be an issue after quitting. I thought it would be the opposite.

My partner quit at the same time and he has perfect clarity of all his memories, past and present, I'm so happy for him but I'm so upset about this situation I am in. I want to go back to uni and I can't remember what I had for breakfast let alone learn new things.

I got introduced to weed in my first year of college and never looked back again. After my Master’s, I briefly quit(for 3-4 months) when I was applying to become an officer in the military but as soon as I failed my 7-day interview, I started smoking again, thinking this time it would be different or I would handle it much differently but to no avail. 
Even though I hated being lazy, lethargic and high all the time from morning to evening which I knew was affecting the growth of my Edtech company I recently started I couldnt get my self to quit until 2020. I would try to think that I would quit from next Monday but that didnt come until I got married and the pandemic hit us. 

There was a total lockdown in my country (I’m from India) and I thought this is the best time to quit and I didnt touch it for 3 months and 12 days. Then I wanted to resolve some issues with my business partner and tell him few of things that were on my mind, so thought smoking up and chilling was the best thing to go on about it. I had insane confidence thinking that I could quit whenever I wanted so smoked with him and the next day and the next day which continued upto July 5th of 2021. 

I’ve changed my careers from growing and building a start-up to managing my family’s educational institution, so I had relatively stable work-hours. So I told my self that if I smoke aftwr a long day of work, it’s actully beneficial hut that would again sporal into waking and baking and making up excuses to myself to not go to work that day and just chilling on my bed while watching netflix.  I knew smoking in the evening was affecting my energy, mindset and making me feel comfortable which is the worst that we could be feeling especially when we’re running a businnes in very crowded market-place and it’s a dog-eat-dog world out there..! 
I was sick of my inability to quit or stay sober and I was feeling very low when I made up my mind it’s now-or-never situation as i’m 27 and cant afford to fuck up my life-goal of impacting as many people I could for better by changing the educational ecosystem here in India.
Finally I found this group and got myself to quit cold turkey and it’s been around 17 days since I last smoked. 

It’s soooo hard this time as I never felt the withdrawal symptoms this intensely ever before. I’m waking up with a huge hangover like symptoms : terrible headache and brain-fog. I dont know if it’s because of this or something else but I cant make myself get out of the bed few days and other days 8’m brinming with energy. I’ll sit on my desk to do some work which has been oending for long time and suddenly Idint feel like doing and I just wanna go and lie down on the bed and do nothing for that whole day except watch some netflix or things like that. 

Could you guys please help me with few tips and routines which I can incorporate so that it’s much easier for me to stay away from this medicine-turned-poison: Mary Jane.

Smoking morning, noon, and night and I wasn't even getting high anymore. Just robbed of my energy and motivation to do anything at all. And coughing so much my ribs were hurting. I started prescription drugs about 6 months ago for my depression, and since then have quit drinking and smoking cigarettes too. I also got in therapy for some PTSD that decided to pop it's head up after 17 years. I just want the most out of this life I can get and my good friend, weed, was holding me back. 

I read a great analogy on here about it. Say weed is at a level 3 or 4 on a spiritual growth chart. When you are at Level 1 or 2, weed really can help and pull you up. It's an amazing non-prescription drug! But when you want to progress past that, like to levels 5, 6, 7, etc., weed then pulls you down. At that point it's no longer helping.

Weed IS medicine. It helped me thru most of my life. I've used and quit all the other non-prescription drugs, hardcore style and everything, but never left weed. It insulated and protected me from all the trauma and pain I've ever been thru. But I really do believe that our True Power lies on the other side of our pain. We have to go thru it. There's no way around. My therapist is really helping me recognize my triggers, and the core issues it touches on for me. It is enlightening! I want that true power. I want to be done with the stupid shit that's held me back in life. I want more! I'm almost 50, and finally investing in myself and my spiritual growth. It was all about survival up until now. Sick of surviving, time to start thriving! Better late than never. Another great line I read on here is ""Choose your hard."" Powerful statement!

Over the past few weeks though I can't stop thinking how MUCH I would loveeeee to smoke a joint.. I miss getting high 😕 
I've just got into a relationship with an occasional smoker (Which I don't mind) she doesn't encourage, smoke around me or even want me to smoke as she knows my reasons for stopping and tells me it's not worth it. I just cant helping feeling that ""one joint wouldn't hurt""

Last November, I decided enough was enough, and cut myself off from drinking. At the time, the idea of also quitting weed was too much for me to accept. But lately, I've come to realize I'm seriously emotionally dependent on this drug, and it's only holding me back from realizing my full potential as a human.

Since I was 15, I've consistently used weed or alcohol (or whatever drug I could get) to cope with life. Now, at 25, I can't wait to see what it's like to exist in the world without my perceptions being blunted by some kind of mood altering substance. 

I'm currently on day 2 without weed, and sweet lord, this is not easy. My mood is all over the place, I have no energy, my digestive system is wilding out. I haven't felt this miserable in a VERY long time. But, I know the only way out is through.

I work at an inpatient addiction treatment center, and a large part of my job is basically teaching the patients about how they can lead successful, happy lives after they leave. I try to show them that they CAN feel okay without drugs. And I can't wait to be able to honestly tell these patients how much better life is without weed. 

I want to be the best role model I can be for these guys, and give them some real hope that anything is possible if you're determined! A couple years ago, I never would've believed I could be happy completely sober. Now, though the withdrawals are dulling the light I see at the end of the tunnel, I know that this journey will bring me so much closer to the life ive always wanted! 

So to anybody else struggling on this day, just remember- if weed were any good for you, it wouldn't be this painful to get through the day without it. Don't let your brain trick you!",27,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5302987}"

But.. I always promised myself when I turned 30 I would quit it all.

So here I am, teetotal me.

I want to start off by thanking you all because I cannot express how grateful I am to be able to have a community like this where we all share this same common 'struggle' with weed.  Years before when i tried to quit my addiction, I used to think I was alone in this before I found this community.  My stoner friends never quite took me seriously about this topic and I would sometimes be ridiculed for it with the same old ""Weed is not addictive""  ""You are only imagining these withdrawals"" etc.  It actually got to a point a few years ago when paranoid me began to believe that maybe something was wrong with me or that I had just been smoking laced weed my whole life and I was maybe hooked onto that!  So thank you all again for sharing all your stories and helping one another here, it really is nice to see, and to be a part of a place where I feel I fit in.  I have visited this forum on many occasions taking advice and inspirational stories from people, so now i figured I would stop being an information leach and actually try contribute to the community for a change.  

I had smoked weed every single day, all day, for 8 years straight from the age of 19.  I was a straight A high school student and athlete that went to college and purely 'Went off the rails' having discovered weed, and from that point on my life had just been an absolute wasteful blur.  I didn't just smoke weed, I abused it. When I say I smoked every day I am talking 10 fat joints a day minimum every single day non-stop 24/7 high.  I feel really ashamed just typing that.  What started as trying weed for the first time with new friends in my new college dorm room became a full blown addiction 1 month later to the point where I could not function as a human unless I was high.  Damn I thought I was living the life at first, thinking I could complete my daily tasks high out of my mind, but wow did it all come back to bite me in the ass!  My life just spiraled out of control.  My addiction was so bad at 1 point that i had a huge panic attack after I smoked every single time, yet knowingly I would still keep smoking and 'ride it out' just because i needed my next dose of THC.  It all happened so quickly and I am still not sure how it happened, but it did.  From someone who was enrolled in a degree in chemical engineering and meant to be a success story, ended up being a self loathing unemployed 27 year old still living with his parents.  That is my brief summary to where I was a few months ago. Pathetic I know. 

I myself now am currently 6 months sober, having tried to quit smoking weed twice before over the past 8 years, but this time it is different.  This time I know for sure I wont relapse because I have learnt to love life again whilst not being in a permanent numb haze.  What hit me hardest at first was looking back on those years and not remembering most of it.  Life is precious, and to have flushed away so many years in my prime was a big downer at first, but that leads me to my next bit:

I want to tell those of you who have just quit and are fresh into withdrawals that **IT DOES GET BETTER**.  The joys of life do return, but it takes time.  How much time depends on who you are and also how well you look after yourself during your recovery process. I used to come here often reading deeply into people's posts trying to find that golden answer of when I would feel 'normal' again after quitting weed, and I would end up spending hours in circles and driving myself crazy.  Of course we are all different, so there is no definite answer but I can tell you now from personal experience that there does come a time where you will be happy again.  This journey is yours to take and your answers will all eventually arrive.  One might say but who am I to say that having only been 6 months sober?  Well let me tell you this: 

In my previous attempt at quitting back in 2016 I also went 6 months sober (1 joint got me completely hooked again for many years) but damn I was a miserable, paranoid mess the whole time, every single bit of the way.  Even after the intense physical withdrawals of no sleep, no appetite, diarrhea, cold sweats, blurry vision etc, I was still so morbidly depressed and angry all the time.  Now this leads me to my final point below of what I changed this time around and i honestly and truly hope it helps at least one of you too.  These are the changes I made this time around that made the world of difference to me:

Yes okay I went through the same terrible physical withdrawals for around 10 days directly after going cold turkey this time too, but my mental state was completely different.  I went into the withdrawal phase knowing the demons that were coming my way, but this time I was mentally ready to battle them head on.  Instead of laying around as time passed and just hoping things would feel better, **I decided to love myself and changed my negative mindset.**  That was key.  Yes of course it is easier said than done, but changing your mental state will make things so much better along your journey.  Your brain is one powerful tool so use it to your advantage.  Neuroplasticity is real, so rewire yourself into the new best possible you.  In my case, in my height of withdrawals I made the conscious decision to go back to college and also to give a huge amount of focus into my health by doing intense cardio and weightlifting every day to repair all the damage I had done to my body as fast as I could.  You obviously don't have to do what I did, but find YOUR new healthy obsession/hobby that will propel your life forward and make you feel good about yourself.  I'm not saying you are going to feel like gold immediately, but when you get yourself into a healthy obsession such as looking after yourself and wanting to be the best version of you, it makes you take your mind away from the negativity and channels it into positivity.  It even took my mind off the weed cravings altogether because this was my new healthy addiction.  It wasn't always rainbows and unicorns at first of course.  It was tough to muster up the motivation when feeling a bit empty at times, but telling myself that I was going to be the best I can be and visualizing my future success is what made me want to get out there straight away again!  I would keep telling myself that I am going to beat this and that I am going to give my utmost everything into being the best version of me that I can possibly be going forward.  Instead of loathing in depression and being fueled with self doubt, like I was in my past attempts at sobriety, I channeled everything into making positive changes.  When you begin to see small results from these positive obsessions, that then begins to spike your natural dopamine back, and in essence 'fixes' your brain faster.  I'm not trying to making it all seem so simple, because it was hard at times, but just try your best to suck it up in that moment and push forward and you will feel that natural sense of accomplishment and joy from the endorphins afterwards.  6 months in and I am truly happy.  I wish for you all to be happy too because it is worth it and you will get there. Never ever give up even at your weakest moment.  

I'm sorry if this all sounds like a bit of a preach, but I just am hoping the things I have learnt along my journey towards feeling normal again without weed will hope some people on here too. I wish I had made this mental shift years ago because I'm sure I wouldn't have been so miserable and relapsed.  I once too felt like life would never get better. I really hope this helps at least one person out there.

Some other tips I have learnt from my previous failures and self experiences:

Do not use alcohol or another substance as a crutch whilst quitting weed, because it wont allow your brains' reward system to rewire itself and you will still feel crappy and have cravings to chase the dragon.

Do not think after a certain period of time that you are no longer addicted to weed and so that it will be okay to just have 1 joint, because before you know it you will be blazing hard again.  We must accept that we have an addiction problem to weed (Otherwise you would not be here on this forum!) and must just cut it out forever. 

Do not ponder on the past.  There is nothing at all you can do to change that, but rather focus on the new you and the amazing future you are going to work towards.

Distance yourself from your old stoner friends unless they can respect your decision to not smoke and do not do so around you. 

Eat lots of veggies and drink lots of water, and yes exercise definitely does help!

Appreciate the small victories on your journey and get that natural dopamine pumping again!

All the best everyone :)",16,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3927642}"

I’m here for the same reason as many of you: my usage has become a serious problem and I don’t enjoy it anymore. I feel trapped by it, and it’s not bringing me happiness. There is so much more to life than what I'm doing right now, and I know that if I make it a few days, I will already see benefits. I’ve had so many day 1s it’s laughable, but I’m trying to stay positive and optimistic and keep reminding myself that my heart is in the right place. I just need that extra push.

I’ve thrown away all my paraphernalia and don’t have anything in the house anymore. The next 7 days will be extremely busy for me, and usually I would use that as an excuse to not quit. Since weed is the way I deal with stress, it feels like I will never get through a stressful week without it. But I think I can. I really want to be able to turn my mind off for a week, and just focus on the tasks ahead. No thinking, just doing, that sort of thing.

2021-07-21 15:07:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/oowoan/we_have_the_power_to_change_things/,We have the power to change things.,"I (27m) feel like this statement is often overlooked due to constant stress and anxiety about the past. I remember watching this Breaking Bad episode where Jesse Pinkman is in a rehab meeting. Pinkman berates the counselor by asking him if he’s ever hurt anyone. The counselor tells him that he accidentally ran over his daughter, who was playing in the driveway, while on his way to buy more alcohol. Jesse then proceeds to ask him, “how do you not hate yourself?” The counselor replies, “I did for a really long time. But guilt and shame accomplish nothing, they only get in the way.” Jesse asks, “in the way of what?” The counselor states, “true change.” 

We can think about how much we have ruined our lives. We can spend hours criticizing ourselves over the lives we chose to lead. We can remain heartbroken over “the one that got away.” We can hate ourselves over how much money we’ve wasted. We can pity ourselves for having no direction in life. But at the end of the day, what does any of that accomplish? There’s work to be done. 

I know the withdrawals suck but what ya gonna do ya know? Go through it. I’ve done a lot of shit in my life that I wish I hadn’t. Shit, I’m kinda in debt up my ass with no job right now. But constantly thinking about my problems and feeling sorry for myself isn’t going to help anything. Like I said, there’s work to be done and I have the power to change shit. 

Anyway, I hope this helps someone. Stay strong, my friends!

Long story short, I was an addicted heavy user for 10 years which eventually got me a psychosis and to a mental institution.

I haven't smoked for a year now.
The big question is if I meet with people, especially girls and they wanna smoke.
Should I say it bothers me and prefer they won't? Or should I learn to live with it around me from time to time?
I know the obvious answer is to avoid as much as I can from even smelling it but i regret I'll miss getting to know people who are weed smokers.
I'm moving to a new location in the countryside which has a very spiritual scene and believes there are alot of smokers there.

And boom like a light switch I started getting depersonalised again, I got scared by my surroundings, I felt disconnected with him again and even he didn’t make me feel calm and safe like he always does. I basically ran back home and now I’m slightly better. 
I’m really scared this is a psychosis and that gives me major anxiety. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I’m scared to tell him I quit weed or even smoked to begin with as it’s illegal where I live. 
Should I stick it out and hope it will get better?

I've begged myself, God, the Universe, to rid me of this addiction I was so convinced I'd never fall into. To no avail, of course.

Venting!,"The fact that i even considered quitting is that i realized I didn’t even like smoking in the first place. You know first times made me anxious and trapped in my own mind with bad thoughts. Sure it was nice to comedown and chill and eat but the relaxing feeling was all because the horrible situation ended , pretty much like taking off a very tight shoe after a long annoying walk and ofcourse it feels awesome. It was like i tried to learn the addiction to enjoy it! By increasing my tolerance (which the anxiety was still there but it was less sometimes.) I’ve gotten high on days that i felt totally great but hit the joint and turned to an overthinking anxious fuck instantly. I used allen carr’s method for quitting cigarettes which kind of helped with the mindset towards quitting weed too,but yet still i have thought loops about situations i might miss smoking which somehow makes and doesn’t make sense at the same time because of the reasons i told above ( not enjoying smoking weed truly in the first place).for example what if I’m at great music festival (I’ve never been to one)and i miss the opportunity to listen to all that beautiful music high, and  what if the crowd and the atmosphere would make me forget all about the anxiety and have the time of my life! (Therefore i should say that most of the times at the peak of my high I don’t really like music cause sometimes it makes me more anxious and make my bad thoughts bolder and sometimes I’m in a very dark place mentally that i can’t even listen to the songs i find amazing while sober ,and I can’t focus on the music. BUT on the other hand sounds feel different and sometimes deeper while I’m high at any stage of the high that’s for sure. The time i really like listening to music while I’m high is when I’m slowly starting to come down which i think it relates to the the tight shoe theory and when  i start taking them off it is amazing lol !of course there have been highs that i have enjoyed music on the peak but they have been rare and the anxiety was still there only less those times! ). So i think of two possible outcomes everytime first is drowning in the atmosphere and maintaining a anxiety free high and second the bad high experience all over again. The festival thing is the only situation i feel i might miss something. I pretty much know in every other situation it would only makes things worse and i won’t enjoy a damn thing. i feel my obsessive ass mind is creating the whole festival thing as an excuse but at the same time i think what if the feelings i get while i think about those music festivals are real and in fact that would be a delightful experience. I have hard time managing this thought and it really bothers me throughout the day. It’s like a mental torture having one annoying thought drilling my fuckin mind. Any same experience or any suggestions about whether my fuckin mind has a point or it’s just a fuckin illusion would be highly appreciated. I know if i can manage this thought to find out is it real or just another false mindset , would put me in a situation of never ever wanting to smoke weed ever again!

This one's mine ;),"Day 2 here, although I think I’m in a better spot than some folks. I’ve had a lot of sober time from both alcohol and weed, although about a month ago decided to try Delta 8, since weed is not legal where I live. I loved the LESS intense high, because I really could take it at any time and didn’t need to get all angsty and paranoid. 

But in just one month of use, what has gone by the wayside?

* Healthy food prep. I was on a good roll for a while there. Not doing terrible, but lots of lazy nights.
* Exercise has only happened so far on the days during this month where I was like, “No more! I’m done!” (and then went out to buy some after the gym).
* Writing. I’ve been working hard on writing horror fiction for 3 years now (the same time I’ve been sober from alcohol, oddly). Haven’t done any this past month; not really. My usual routine is to get up at 5 a.m. and do my writing then. I’ve felt foggy and tired in the morning, and the couple of times I DID sit down to right wasn’t mentally agile.
* Chores in the evening. After 5 p.m., all bets off as far as getting anything else done for the day.
* Avoiding certain tasks or chores because they would ruin my high. Today for instance, I went to pick up our farm share box, and instead of hurrying back home to get high, took the time to stop by the food co-op for fruits & veggies. 
* Bailed on my sugar-free streak (have spent most of 2021 sugar-free, which is a whole other thing).
* Avoiding social events because I’d rather be home to zone out on the couch.

But what really gets me is how many days in a row I’ve been like, “no more, not today” and then I end the day high. Day after day. The whisper of “just one more night, one more weekend, just this next week” because I knew that once I got some sober days down it would be harder to mess them up. 

But that whisper… that is exactly how a day turns into a month to a year and then a decade, or more. The headspace this has been taking up feels like such a familiar pattern, and I don’t know why I keep poking the bear. (Addiction history: mostly quit drinking like 13 years ago minus experiments with trying to have “just some” and then “maybe try now?” and then, “well, how about now?” Then, messing around with some other substances – thankfully not the heavy hitters although one did have a pretty rough withdrawal window.)

I would really like to get to the point where I just stop all of the nonsense. Because that whisper has us giving our lives away, our potential, and really, our ability to enjoy life on its own terms. So, I know better, I really do. On my behalf, I have had some family stuff going on with an aging father and a literally batshit crazy sister, but… there will always be things. Some part of me is apparently still hanging around waiting for an excuse.

Anyhow, Day 2. Spending a little time on these reflections to get my head in the right space. Very grateful to probably NOT have a rough a road coming up as some folks here (given the nature of my substance and relatively short period of regular use). But I also won’t be getting that glorious fresh look into sobriety and freedom from this particular bondage that many of you have waiting for you. It’s pretty freaking amazing.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43195134}"

About a month ago I wrote a silly post on here asking about ""smoking occasionally"" as I was sure my 2 month break at the time was enough to overcome years of smoking to escape bad emotions, depression, anxiety (until it mostly turned into a habit, i.e. *dependence*).

I was warned by the good people of this subreddit not to smoke, but I had already decided and I lit one up. It was alright, tried to be ""healthy"" about it and not feel ashamed. At first I managed, but as soon as I had a larger amount at home it turned into smoking as often as possible; couple of nights in a row on a weekly basis, even when I felt tired and *knew* the better option would be to go to sleep.

I have to accept that I can't smoke no more, and that's actually hard - the fact that I crave it just reinforces the notion that I am addicted. Seems it's harder for me to actually come to terms with that...

I have been very anxious, even depressed lately and I'm wondering if it could be from stopping again? I mean, I only smoked for a couple of weeks, after the 2 month break, wasn't even always daily. Could my withdrawal symptoms really be that bad? 

I hope this time I quit for good... Now I have to fight the cravings for weed, as well as alcohol and just straight up anxiety meds; I guess my body and mind are looking for alternatives.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5686835}"

I have 1 week left of classes, and the whole reason I quit after 15 years of smoking multiple times a day is coming up!

The entire reason I quit is because I can't smoke and do this job, it would probably end up costing someone their life. I knew I would have to quit well before the end of my class because of my heavy use, started taking at home drug tests and still came up positive, up until this past weekend, I had my first negative drug test! I honestly felt so proud, I ended up keeping the drug test as a reminder of how strong I actually am.

I'll be honest, the first 2-3 weeks were horrible, I couldn't sleep, didn't have an appetite, and was constant having diarrhea, and all I wanted to do was just spark up again. I can definitely say after 70 days, my routines have changed, I don't plan everything around smoking, and I for sure see a difference in my life. I won't lie and say I don't miss it, because I definitely do, but I know I'm doing the right thing.

The only negative out of this whole experience is that my cigarette smoking has increased once I stopped. I've been a cigarette smoker for about the same amount of time, 15 years, and had a small success in cutting back, I was only smoking about 5 cigarettes a day, opposed to the pack a day I was smoking. Now that I'm not using marijuana, I've noticed I'm back up to a pack a day. I don't know if it's my subconscious trying to fill the voids of the routines I had while smoking or what, but it's definitely been my biggest downfall so far.

For anyone out there thinking about quitting or just starting, just remember you got this!

I started smoking weed when I was 15 and have not stopped since about 6 days ago. Wow. The fact that I look at my life before I was 15 and see almost every moment leading up to that point but not one real first person memory from when I started smoking. I was the most talkative happiest person truly, and then sure enough one day I seemed so distant. Doing the things I love, but just not in my own mind. When realizing the fact that I can’t experience life to it’s fullest while diluting my heart and soul for motivation I wanted to stop. I stopped for 2 days and it all hit me. Weed is my life, was my life, and I have to change that. It feels weird let me tell you, mood swings are real! Feeling lost is real! Feeling 0 motivation is real! But the truth is, you weren’t like this before the physiological imbalance. You have to tell your self that your brain is addicted not you! After 6 days I’ve realized the life I was living literally was not reality and I have to make this my new reality. I’m trying and trying to find motivation and it’s hard but I know I’m not crazy. Trust me if I know during this time at 6 days that I’m not crazy and it will get better shortly than you can manage to do the same thing. The addict voice is the beast inside you wanting normalcy or wanting pleasure, but in reality you need to create your new life and stick with it until you find your reasoning. Feeling lost is all part of the process, hell I can’t even sleep because I’m up every night thinking why I don’t feel normal or like doing anything. Take every little step as a positive and keep going! Update you soon



*update* 
I made the addiction my “beast”. I tell this thing that it wants to smoke and not me. I’m not a smoker but it is. I’ve realized so much about myself and how happy I can be without weed. Tonight I enjoyed a group of friends for real for the first time in 3 years. Wow it feels great and I never wanna go back. Temptation to drink and smoke is real but the fact is I have an addictive personality so rn is not the best time. Smoking made me hide all of my insecurities instead of face them head on to make a change for myself. If you can’t so no to drugs, think about what else you can’t say no to?  I mean literally the beast has a hold of u I guarantee in many aspects of your life. Idk how ima feel tomorrow but I’ve never been so confident in believing in change for my all around better self. All the issues I brought upon my relationship was pretty much me, figuring this out makes you so confident.

I honestly didn't think I'd be posting on this sub for a while, but I subscribed back on 4/20/21 when I found out about it, knowing I'd eventually want to cut off my usage. 

I had surgery 7/2 and used regularly for nearly 10 years prior. I cut off my usage a couple days before surgery because I know that smoking increases certain risks. After surgery, I used for pain management for about a week, but once I went back to work last week, I found the desire to smoke at nearly 0 and went Monday-Thursday without. On Friday, my day off, I decided to have a little and found that all it did was zap the life out of me. What should've been a fun afternoon playing Terraria with my partner turned into a struggle to stay awake and focused. I *hated* it. I regretted taking the few hits I took. 

And now here I am. I somehow quit without intending to quit and I'm feeling really good. My daily anxiety at every little thing has calmed down. I feel focused and centered. I want to keep this feeling. 

I know it'll take a while until it's totally out of my system (seriously, 10 years of daily usage), but I'm looking forward to moving on without feeling the need to smoke at the end of every work day or every hour during my off days, or before every social function.

I started about 15 years ago, and became a daily smoker 10 years ago. Near the end my partners dad would gift us literal garbage bags full of mids from their harvest. It seemed like there was no way to get away from it.

But I did. After years of knowing it gave me anxiety, knowing it impacted my motivation, knowing it negatively affected my relations with my family, I quit. April 20th was my last day to smoke, and I haven't looked back.

The first 2 weeks were certainly the worst. Sleep was awful, my appetite was almost non-existent, I wasn't able to avoid the things that weed helped me forget. After 2 weeks though the clouds broke, and the sun shone in.

In the past when I tried to quit I though putting down the pipe was enough. What was different this time?
 I've been addressing the feelings that led me to want to smoke in the first place.

1: I've always been avoidant and struggled with anxiety. Weed helped me be so involved in my hobbies that I could ignore my troubles. I've been confronting the things that make me anxious instead of letting them fester. Meditation along with mindfulness and stoic practices have been a godsend. 

2: I've given up the idea that I just need a break. In the past I've thought that I could moderate, and it always ends with me blazed out of my mind.

3: I've gotten medication for my ADHD. Now its so much easier to actually make an actionable plan for my life and goals and stick with it.

4: I've built other habits. Now every day I play guitar, lift dumbbells, and am working towards doing daily runs and body weight exercises. If I'm not getting endorphins and engagement from weed it has to come from somewhere!

There is absolutely no roadmap to getting through withdrawals or fighting those urges or even getting a good night's sleep. What works is what works for *you.* I had tried countless things from people on this thread and some of them are now part of my routine! But what works for one person doesn't always work for someone else, so don't be afraid to drop something if it isn't working--just like you dropped weed.

With that being said, I am now on day 46 and I feel...almost human again. I still struggle with the depressive moods, bouts of anxiety and feelings of loneliness. But, like other symptoms of recovery, these will all improve with time. Once you are past the initial physical withdrawals, don't be surprised if you are still experiencing some wild emotional roller coasters. Who knows how long they will last as your brain continues to re-learn what chemicals to release and when. Some people will experience them for months, some may not at all. Our bodies recover differently and we have to try to take things in stride. I'm no expert, as I am woefully impatient, but I am learning to go slower these days and just worry about the next hour and not the next day.

I also want to say that it is 100% fine to seek the help of a mental health counselor/therapist or even your doctor. It is important to keep on top of your health through this process and if your doctor thinks you could benefit from a medication, then give it a shot.

My dad actually helped me get my first ""green card"" so I was able to buy medical weed easily whenever I wanted.

At first it was fun, always having weed, experiencing new situations. However when I went off to college that year I spiraled into a depression, always looking for the next hit, spending my nights in my dorm hitting the bong, paranoid my roommates would know (of course they knew I smoked inside), and wandering around eating whatever I could.

This cycle has happened numerous times, with different roommates and houses. My boyfriend of 6 years hit if off due to our shared interest in weed. My dad and brother both smoke so it's something that I'm often around.

Only in the last few months have I realized that weed has become my self-harm replacement. I used to cut, burn, etc. but since weed have really been away with those behaviors.

Weed now is my self-harm. Smoking until my throat is sore. Isolating from social situations to get high, which leads me depressed. My anxiety is worse when smoking, and I seem to crave the altered state of mind that tells me I'm worthless. Spending a whole day high just because I want to see how it feels and regretting it by noon. Eating to the point of pain, and forcing myself to throw up, just to feel a bit better. I don't enjoy smoking now, I can't enjoy it by myself, and even in social situations I find all I can think about is relieving the munchies and not actually enjoying the high.

I'm making a goal to hit 6 months free of smoking. I went 6 months without drinking last year and that seems reasonable. I need to stop the self-harm and self-hate and learn to love myself again.",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5041461}"

Hello Leavers! First off, thank you all for everything you do, I wouldn't have made it this far without you. Today I'm celebrating two weeks sober! Everything is going pretty well except for one thing: **SLEEP.**

I'm falling asleep fine. In fact I fall asleep almost immediately. But I'm waking up between 4am and 5am every day, and am unable to get back to sleep. Did anyone else experience this same end-of-night-insomnia? Did it eventually resolve itself? Did anything help?

**INFO:**

\-The last two and a half years have been a patchwork of sobriety and binging. I've been in a Quitting-Relapsing-Binging-Quitting cycle since March of 2019 (I was sober for six years before that). I have not been able to string together 90 days sober since I first relapsed in 2019. Insomnia is usually one of the primary triggers for my relapses.

\-This became a problem early in the pandemic and has been a problem on and off (more on than off) ever since. I've worked in an office during the entire pandemic with the sole exception of April 2020, when I was able to work from home. I didn't really have this problem for that one, amazing month. I was also mostly sober that month, smoking only with a local friend on Saturdays. That devolved to a full on binge when I was called back to the office in May 2020.

\-I exercise strenuously every day, I meditate every night, I take an otc sleep supplement that I can't name but you all know what it is. All of this helps for falling asleep but doesn't seem to do anything for the specific problem I'm having.

\-I am not remembering my dreams, nor am I waking up with the psychological residue of intense dreams, so I don't think that's the problem.

I want to quit for so many reasons, like having more money, better for my lungs, I want to prevent binge eating, I want more time, I want to focus on my hobbies, and I want to use my whole brain more often.

I've tried quitting so many times and fucked every time up. Last time I quit in April, I had a huge mental breakdown after 2 weeks of no weed. My preferred method of ingesting is vaping with carts. I live in an area where I can get medical weed very easily, so deleting dealers' numbers doesn't work for me.

I'm at work now and I'm fucking bummed. If anyone says ANYTHING to me, I take it as a personal attack on my own character. I know that's not reality but it's how I feel. I have undiagnosed ADHD, insomnia, low self esteem, and peek-a-boo depression that make it really easy for me to vape copious amounts of weed to be able to focus on a single task, or go to sleep, or get an appetite, or just to zone out and enjoy some entertainment.

I'm looking forward to seeing a new therapist tomorrow for my many small issues. I feel embarrassed at these issues, because I'm very privileged in every other way.

I'm pessimistic about gaining control over my weed addiction. I'm worried I'll be depressed and inattentive forever, or that I'll be a stoner forever. I really wish I could moderate but it's clear that I can't. I want to NOT WANT weed, I want to dislike it, but my want for the high is so strong and always has been.

I am a 20 Y/O M who smoked for the first time at 17 and on and off in high school, but have been heavily smoking daily since Fall of 2019, my freshman year of college. I am now a Junior in university who always considered themselves highly functioning (getting high marks even when leisurely smoking) and typically unaffected by marijuana. I was also a e-cigarette smoker since I was 16-17 years of age as well, but quit nicotine vapes (5%+) a year ago and have been clean since. Last July, I thought quitting nicotine would be one of the toughest tasks I would have to do in my life. When I finally broke the cycle and my nicotine withdrawal symptoms subsided into nothingness, my victory seemed short-lived. The time/money I was spending on vaping e-cigarettes had been completely redirected into marijuana use. The habit has become near unsustainable and almost like a chore for me to do everyday. The Coronavirus Pandemic has particularly exacerbated this, and last year in particular was when I realized that I had a problem with marijuana use. Fast-forward to a year today, and I begin the Fall semester of my junior year very soon. I am very lucky to be attending the prestigious state school that I go to, and I wanna do everything in my power to ensure that the studying and hard work pays off (I hope to go to graduate school one day). However, I notice that attaining these goals becomes markedly more difficult when high 85%+ of the day. That is another reason that I have decided to quit marijuana; I spent a lot of time thinking about the things that I wanted to do, rather than actually working towards them.

&#x200B;

I have lurked this sub for a couple months now, toying with the idea of ceasing marijuana use like I have with nicotine. I will be checking back in here for a couple weeks and wanted to know what everyone else's first couple days were like? Quitting nicotine was a monumental task for about 3 days, but became an afterthought after 2 weeks, mainly due to the fact that the time was spent smoking marijuana. I plan on going hard in the gym to kickstart my body in excreting the metabolites. What do you think should I expect as my body adjusts to less THC in the blood? Really happy to finally get started on this road to recovery! Cheers!

I gave myself the opportunity to grow and kept a small sliver of hope alive through the dark times. All I can say is that the pain of quitting will pass and you’ll have an opportunity to make different choices instead of being a slave to the addiction. I met a girl who was just as addicted as I was, high 24/7 for a decade plus, the other night. She was itching to get high again after just a few hours of hanging out. So glad I’m not that person anymore. She confirmed she is addicted and weed is addictive no matter what people say. Anyone who is working to break that cycle deserves a medal because it is really hard. Harder than anyone who hasn’t gone through it knows. I know. I see you. Keep fighting. Keep believing. It will get easier.",13,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.75335014}"

Growing up I was your typical teenage stoner, though I always prided myself on being able to keep a presentable facade. I quit once in my lifetime years ago due to anxiety and was off of it for few years, happily too. Then covid happened and living with stoners, locked in all day, I started smoking again, and abused it like never before in my life. Long story short, I eventually had a pretty intense panic attack and the aftermath of it left me incredibly shook: I decided to quit and I just know that this time it’s for good. I don’t know if it’s the withdrawal, or just my anxiety (probably both) but the first week (especially the third day) was absolute hell. I felt like I was losing my mind, the anxiety was off the charts, derealization, intrusive thoughts, the mood swings, insomnia (still dealing with that), it was just too much. Starting my second week clean, I’m starting to see the light. Still having trouble sleeping, but I’m glad to even just feel a wee bit more grounded than I did last week. I know I’ll feel better though, and this whole ordeal finally pushed me towards seeking professional help to get on top of my anxiety. For anyone going through this, be strong, have faith in yourself, have faith in some higher power if you believe in it, be close to someone you love and who loves you, and persevere. You’ll get through this

At first I thought just quitting was going to automatically make life wonderful. It definitely makes life better, but it really just frees you up to make it wonderful yourself. It's not automatic. You can still just sit around and veg, eat too much, waste time playing games, watching tv etc. If that's what you choose to do, you're going to have the same outcome.  You're just not going to have weed to numb you to the dissatisfaction of it. I love being more alert, being around mentally at work and for family and friends. Love driving without worrying about having it on me. Love smelling better. Love not being tires all the time. The biggest gain is the anxiety loss. I was feeling constantly on edge either on or off in the end. I'm way more even kilt now. I've had to push myself to do other things. Working out is a huge thing.

But I’m going to go ahead and write it anyway because it took me a solid 5 minutes to work up the courage to actually search up this sub as much as it kills me having to now accept the fact I do need help, and what I’m doing is not okay. 

A quick recap about me and my mental state: I’m 19 years old born in April so still early, a female, I’m currently studying a certificate in AOD (Alcohol & other drugs) other then that, I’m unemployed. I have worked hard long hours in the past and I have proof and truly mean that. It Sven shocks me how after I went through all these medications trying to find the right one I have never been able to get that same normal head state back that was me. I am currently diagnosed with Aspergers, ADHD, and bipolar 11. According to doctors  because I wasn’t diagnosed and treated properly it made me go into the severe depression i went through-I changed so much it’s actually unbelievable. And I feel for the girl I lost. The girl that was once myself. So after that I was misdiagnosed and given the wrong medication and that gave me a drug induced (?) (plz correct me if I’m wrong I don’t quite remember the exact term) bipolar II. 

I’ve been self medicating with marijuana ever since I fell into a severe depressive state and was misdiagnosed with the wrong medication which made me manic. 
I just want to make it clear *I had never touched marijuana until my depression became mania.*
I have done every drug except via injection, and for fairly long periods too ‘just to test them out’, and surprisingly I could go cold turkey without a care in the world time and time again! But with bud, it changes me. I feel that rage and temptation that you hear about in cases where people kill others for money just to be able to get their fix.

I am more addicted to bud than I ever thought was humanely possible. I start getting mental, social, physical, and psychological withdraws all after a couple of hours if I don’t have a bong... I can’t even imagine what more than a day would feel like... please if anyone has been through or experienced the intensity or anything when it comes to the addiction of smoking weed specifically smoking bongs—how did you deal with it?",20,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.73890984}"

Anyways, I know what I’m about to write here has been posted a million times over so I’m sorry for the redundancy but as I said above, I’m doing this alone and haven’t really talked about it in full detail to anybody as of yet. So here’s my backstory... I’ve been a heavy chronic user of THC in the form of concentrates for the past 7-8 years now. I did a little math and found that I averaged around 4 dabs per day this past year. Before concentrates I was a mod-heavy user of flower for 4-5 years. Of course, I took intermittent breaks throughout my use history for drug tests and to lower my tolerance but the longest I went was for a couple of weeks with every intention of picking it back up once I was able to. Flash forward to now and I’m a little over a month into my THC celibacy. I decided to quit because...well 10+ years is a long time to hide from an unhindered state of mind and body. With that being said... Holy f@ck I feel like sh!t. I was expecting to feel a bit edgy and lethargic but not full on withdrawal symptoms similar to when I quit nicotine. I’m still 100 percent committed to my decision and know that things will get better with time from what I read on here, I’m just blown away by how bad my body and mind feels right now. Definitely depressed, aches and pains, extreme lethargy throughout the day, and an inconsistent sleep pattern. Luckily for me, I’ve conditioned myself to associate these feelings with using again so it’s been pretty easy for me to resist the urges (kind of Pavlov’d myself there). I have a very supportive girlfriend but she’s never even touched the devils lettuce, or really any kind of illicit substance for that matter, so she can’t really relate. I live in Colorado so...yeah most everybody I know partakes and has no intention in quitting unless it’s for a T break so my support system is quite weak so that’s why I’m on here with this very long post.

I quit back in January and February this year, but started up again after that. That's the only time until now that I've quit. The last time I smoked was on July 4th. I have to quit now because I've gotten into a college program that I've been wanting to get in to for a long time and they drug test. 

The first time I quit in January I had a fairly easy time. When I started back up I was smoking more than ever. I'm about two weeks in and seriously struggling. I constantly think about the act of smoking. My routine was so calming and relaxing to me. I have severe anxiety and depression and I credit my being alive now to marijuana. Any time I had stress I could look forward to my routine. I've been restless, not sleeping right, having night sweats and strange vivid dreams. Intense cravings and anxiety. 

I feel like I've started coping in other ways. Drinking a lot. Today I broke down and bought a Juul because I just needed something to smoke on, but it didn't satisfy my craving. I'm afraid I'm trading my marijuana addiction for something much worse... alcoholism and an addiction to nicotine if I continue this vaping. I'm not sure how to cope and I've been feeling so depressed. It takes every ounce of my energy to actively avoid smoking. It doesn't help that a lot of my friends and family smoke it as well.

I am sick of the weird intense dreams they're ruining sleep which still comes easy. I'm not eating particularly different. No mood changes. My motivation is more or less the same. My bouts of anxiety are just as frequent. My daily activities are unchanged.

My smoking was minimal before & throughout the day, maybe a bowl or 2. I know some people see a major benefit from quitting but I'm just bored. I get it, it could be me wanting to smoke. But can anyone here at least acknowledge that it's possible that SOME people CAN smoke a reasonable amount & maintain a productive & healthy life?

I'm not doing it to escape anything I just enjoy it. I will refrain from smoking for a few more days at least but the longer I go the less of a reason I see. The point of me not smoking was to improve myself, see if I can & to see if I was addicted.

I get a week isn't a long time but if I was able to cut down & then stop with little to no problem isn't that a good sign of how dependent I was on it in the first place? I'm not trying to justify starting to smoke again I'm trying to understand what it did for me & how it affected me.

Idk dudes I'm just not sure if I'm breaking a very bad habit or something that's just another bad habit of which everyone has some. Am I just depriving myself of something I enjoy? How long did you go before you saw a noticeable improvement? No one in my day to day life has even noticed any kind of change in me.

Either way I plan on not smoking to see if a noticeable improvement does actually manifest because right now I'm just having shitty weird dreams & everything else is just the same as it was when I smoking.

I’ve been smoking for about 12 years, from ages 14-26.

I’ve tried to quit an absurd amount of times, for different reasons. Thinking it will make me more confident, kick anxiety/depression, etc. Unfortunately, quitting doesn’t seem to do much on its own for these issues. 

So, I’ve been on the hamster wheel about whether it’s even worth it. Back and forth endlessly. I’ve been somewhat successfully ‘moderating’ my use the past few months, only toking at night after a productive day. 

However, I’ve realized that even in the most ideal scenario of using, I’m just not present like I am when I’m sober. I might be able to still workout, keep the house clean, work done, etc. but ultimately I’m not growing as a human being. I’m just existing, even if it’s high functioning (no pun intended). 

I’ve recently sought medical help for some of my anxiety and depression issues. You know, what normal people who don’t have a drug addiction would do. I feel now that with medication, along with some supplements, I have the best chance of being done for good that I’ve ever had. 

I know that I will not be able to be as productive, at least initially, after I quit. I’m cool with that. I’m not seeking a miracle from quitting either, like maybe I’ve done in the past. All I want this time around is to be present. I am hopeful that with proper medication and a good support system, that I’ll finally move past this plant. And learn to appreciate life simply as it is.

I love sitting there, slowly grinding everything up, loading a bowl, rolling a joint, and watching my favorite TV show while I blaze. It helps with my anxiety, helps me go to sleep, and helps me unwind from a nice long day. In this regard, marijuana has given me a lot of benefits.

This makes it really really fucking hard for me to quit, cause what marijuana has also given me is a fucked up dopamine reward system that makes everything not seem interesting. Its given me excessive boredom, and even while im doing the things id normally enjoy that should be integral to who i am, and slowly made me stop doing those things.

Marijuana has given me the inability to have genuine fun with other people who arent also smoking at the same time. When people come over, marijuana gives me the choice to be present and mindful, or carefree and mindless. 

And most importantly

Marijuana has given me a reason to be content with the problems in my relationship. I love my girlfriend very very much, but im at home all the time while im ""not really home"". She comes back and wants to hang and talk and do something interesting with me, and marijuana gives me the option to turn that down when i wouldnt otherwise have that option.

Marijuana has given me a laundry list of crippling issues to deal with. But marijuana has given me one more thing: the task of getting rid of everything else its given me, good and bad. 

I've tried quitting so many times just to fall flat on my face, and honestly after the most recent fight with my girlfriend (which weve only have had 2-3 fights in our 2.5 year long relationship) im just kind of upset at myself for not commiting and stopping completely sooner. Fuck dude i managed to kick nicotine 2 weeks ago so what the fuck is stopping me?

I’ve posted here before, I’ve gotten clean for a month at a time probably 5 times now in the past 5 years. Like clockwork. I get motivated, I use the anxiety from withdrawal to push myself into personal projects and for a month it’s like my whole life is starting over; like I’m finally changing my course. And then I always go back.

Why? I can hardly ever remember the justifications I use to smoke again. But it always sucks me right back in. I just want to be able to take care of myself. When I smoke I’m trapped in the “analysis paralysis”. I can’t stop daydreaming, it makes my inner world feel so vivid. There’s this gorgeous ocean of pink red and green psychedelia that flows behind my eyelids. But I never do anything, I sit around on the couch and short out my attention span browsing Apple Music without even really listening to anything actively. I tell my psychiatrist that I think my adhd is getting worse as I get older but it’s probably just the weed shrinking my brain matter and ruining my executive function. Fuck!

I met a good friend last year while working at an Amazon Warehouse over quarantine, a guy from Azerbaijan that was helping me learn Russian and I helped him with English. I drove him to work everyday for like 8 months. He got fired because Amazon is a cruel master and you know what I did? I stopped seeing him, talking to him for 4 months. Not on purpose. It was the weed. Without work forcing me to see him I couldn’t get out of my drug addled social anxiety enough to text him back. To make plans. I just ghosted him like a total asshole and I hate myself for it. It’s happened like this tons of times, I can’t follow through with any kind of real social relationships when I’m just smoking all day every day. I saw him for the first time yesterday and I’m so full of regret. It was great to see him but I know he must think so much less of me even if he won’t say it. All it took was 2 fucking days of exercising some self control and I was able to get over that stupid anxiety-avoidance hurtle and call him.

Here’s to another attempt at quitting, hoping it at least can last a month like it has before and hopefully more this time.

I often convince myself that sobriety is a dramatic goal and it makes more sense to develop a relationship with the substance that's healthier, but that mentality is only making this addiction run deeper.

I've been really socially anxious as the world has been reopening, like I forgot how to socialize. During the pandemic, I used cannabis as a way to entertain myself each night as I was not seeing anyone for weeks at a time. Now, the habit has become deeper engrained that I cannot go a night without smoking weed and spending hours mindlessly doing nothing until I fall asleep hours later than I wanted to.

I hate that I want to leave social obligations early so I can smoke weed and dissociate. It would be one thing if I were using cannabis as a way to be more present with myself, but that is not the case. Hours fly by. I smoke at 10pm and next thing I know it's 3am and I have no recollection of where all the time went. The craving makes me feel disconnected with myself and with the world around me.

I know I cannot mention specifics, but other drugs have become a part of this cycle as well. I am realizing now how deeply we use substances to cope for anxiety or unrequited emotions. I want to quit and know what sobriety feels like, but I'm 24 and my social circles are all engrained in substance-based numbing. I'm queer and in electronic music scenes, so people around me make drugs feel like no big deal. But this really feels like an addiction.

It hit me last night that when I feel socially anxious I take a substance hoping it will numb that feeling and make me more fun to be around, but I should already be fun to be around without needing to take drugs. And the years and years I keep up this habit is not making me believe that any more.

ANYWAYS I feel kind of hopeless. I've been trying to quit for years and years but I always go back. I'm not sure how to even talk to people about this because this struggle has become so repetitive. I just want to be free of it.",16,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7507158}"

I just concentrated on staying sober and slowly started putting plans in place to improve other areas of my life. I saw a therapist, I joined NA, I spoke to a careers guidance counselor.

I'm 34 and I started smoking at 14. I don't think I became a daily smoker until around 16. I smoked a few times a day since then and it was rare to take a day off. I 'took brakes' a handful of times but never made it more than 4 or 5 days. I'm a functional stoner, my life isn't in ruins or anything but that's kind of the problem. I thought I could get away with smoking multiple times a day. I was happy to get stoned all day and do nothing on days off. I'd tell myself it's not harmless but I got this. It's way worse than not harmless. Weed killed my motivation. I always have 30 things to do. I'd cross one thing off my list and then just get high and play video games all day. I thought it was helping me cope with shitty days. I thought it was helping me deal with people. I thought it was helping my anxiety and depression.  I thought it was helping with the constant existential dread I feel... The weed was not making any of these things better, and it was probably making it all much worse. At best It would numb me. But going through life numb to everything isn't really living.

Last year I had a really bad panic attack. Like chest tight, short of breath, extremities cramping up, thought it was a heart attack bad. Ever since then I've been on edge, waiting for that to happen again. Sometimes I'd get high and feel the anxiety swelling back up. I've known I need to quit for years but just couldn't bring myself to do it. Smoking was just too big a part of my life. I would sometimes lay in bed at night telling myself 'Times up I just have to bite the bullet and quit, weeds not helping anymore.' Then I'd wake up the next day and say 'I'll start tomorrow' or 'I'll quit when this bag is gone.' 

I lurked on this sub for a while and I think that's what helped me finally realize this is doable. It really helped reading other people's stories and seeing people going through the exact same thing.  I've told a handful of friends and my heavy smoker parents that I'm just taking a break because weed has been such a huge part of my life that it's hard to admit I've been fucking up this bad for so long. And the idea of actually quitting just seems too big or drastic. But here I am. 

Reading people's stories here helped me realize that I HAVE TO QUIT. That's it. I had a good run but enough is enough.

Even with them shut I can still smell it sometimes.
I don't feel like I can talk to her about it because up until recently I was probably doing the exact same thing to her house with the weed I was smoking & besides I've noticed that she sometimes smokes in her bedroom but the stink still escapes into my house.

Sure, there's always some bad lows ahead, that's life, but what about those moments of real, true, memorable happiness you'll have? What about your friends and family who can respect and trust you more sober? The people who enjoy and love the real sober you, not the high shadow-of-yourself when you're numb and dumb?

**Won't you be proud of all you can be when you're sober? All you can do? All you can have?** Maybe you don't feel proud of yourself at the moment. That's okay. Please, be kind to yourself. I believe in you. You can do it. It might be totally new and unusual for you to live life un-high, un-stoned, un-foggy. But I bet even though it might not come naturally for a while and might be a real struggle sometimes, it'll be worth it. **YOU are WORTH it.**

The real you, the one you've been ignoring and pushing down for so long, the one with energy, thoughts, feelings, motivation, life - they're in there. And you want what's best for them, don't you? If they were your friend? Wouldn't you want what's best for them and to help them if you could? Do you want to get to know them? Do you want to see them be their healthiest and eventually happiest? I really do. Do it for them, aka, you.

I've only got one life. And when I smoke, I don't have a life at all. My mind might try to trick me into thinking I can control it, I can have just a teeeny bit, I mean^justalittle,notveryoften^cmonmannn - but no, I have to shut them up, fast. Because they're lying. **I have lots of evidence that I CAN'T control it. It controls me.** I become a mindless vessel that inhales and exhales smoke all day, every day, and feels high but feels nothing, meets other stoners but makes no connections, might do something or go somewhere (rarely), but have extremely washed-out memories of everything and nothing to show for it, nothing to be proud of. And the people I care about most start to not respect me or enjoy me when I stop taking care of myself or don't follow through or forget things or never have any money. And it's **sad.** *I don't want to be that shell of myself any longer. I don't want to keep holding myself back.* You probably don't either.

I want to stay away from that stuff and never touch it again. I won't be disappointed I can't, or argue with myself about it. I won't even entertain it when the thought happens. I'll laugh and move on. I'll keep living life. I'll treat myself like some silly child asking for a thousand pretty ponies they could never take care of, or a cake as big as a king bed for their dinner every day, that eating a fraction of would make them sick as a dog. *""Not gonna happen, not good for you, not realistic, and just all around ridiculous and silly.* I mean, first of all, **just THINK of how damn EXPENSIVE it would be!""**

###Think of all the other ways to spend time and money. We all have dreams and goals. You deserve them. Don't smoke with me, today and the rest of your life. We can make our lives our own when we're sober. I know we can do it.

This is my first post on this sub, and I am new to reddit so if any of this isn't formatted correctly I apologize. I also am on day 1, and my brain feels more jumbled and foggy than when I am stoned, lol.

I have been an extremely heavy pot smoker since I was 15. Of course there has been the occasional break here and there, with various increases and decreases in usage. I am now 21, so about 6 years.

My biggest hurdle with quitting is, typically within the first 12 hours, I start to feel extremely shameful/guilty about how I have acted these last few years. I don't know if anyone can relate, but I am an extremely lazy stoner. Since I have been smoking I have distanced myself from my friends and family (a lot of my family seem spiteful of the fact I haven't spoken to them in quite a while.) and I no longer have a single person I can consider a friend. 

I lost 2 jobs because I'd wake up so foggy and unmotivated that I would just simply not show up for work. 

My teeth are disgusting because I smoke and get scared of going to the dentist, even though I have needed to for years.

I have been supported by my girlfriend this last year while I go to college. I have gotten a good GPA, however I don't remember shit since i've been fazed the entire time.

I was raised to be the opposite of the way I am now- and as dramatic as it sounds, I find it hard to even look at myself sometimes. I have turned into a loser. If some of my family knew that I was being supported by my girlfriend, they'd disown me.

I'm sorry if this seems like a jumbled mess of thoughts, my brain is fuzzy, it's 3 AM and I feel like I could run a marathon, and some of the feelings of shame are starting to kick in so I thought I would just share how I felt.

Any experiences/advice would be greatly appreciated.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.80645615}"

Recently, having really only initially expected to go for a month or at a push two, I just hit 6 months free of smoking and getting stoned, after being high every day for the past 5 years. In under two weeks it will be 200 days since my last smoke.

I think the biggest thing I can take away from this experience is that, it is impossible to know how deep you are in something until you have the perspective from being out of it. In many ways it was obvious how weed was negatively affecting aspects of my life, there were a myriad of depressed feelings I was refusing to confront and ambitions I was willing falling short of by choosing to get stoned. Though, in other ways it was much harder to recognise the detrimental facets of being high. Prioritising being high may have felt like a choice, but looking back it wasn't really me choosing it. I wasn't present for much of my life / social engagement and only now do I truly feel in control of myself and my future. My mood, attitude, capacity to enjoy: nature, food, art, music.. are all deeper from sobriety than the perceived, yet hollow at times pleasure of engaging in these activities high.

I hope this does not read as animosity towards weed, the blame is entirely on me. I am certain there is real value in the plant. For me, as I'm sure many can relate to, these problems were present in my life and weed whilst being used to avoid them, was exacerbating them also. 

If anything, I hope anybody reading this might try to adopt a positive and optimistic outlook on their choice to try for sobriety. I never thought I would be in this position having spent over half of a year sober, but I am feeling good. And proud of myself. The inspiration to make this change came of wanting to achieve more and I am doing exactly that. I never completely let being high obstruct my work, but speaking honestly this is why I knew I must stop. My judgment was clouded. I was not putting in as much hard work as I could have been, and was setting myself up for little growth, or comfortable failure. So, it has been just that, hard work, a lot of it. 

The last thing I would say is, 6 months ago I was thinking how could it be possible to never smoke again, I relied on it for so many things but having reached this point it no longer feels impossible at all. Rather, I am excited to get up every morning and go to sleep feeling present. The notion of staying sober is no longer an unobtainable goal, I really feel good about it. Here’s to another 6 months! Sending you all positive vibes. Have a lot of faith in yourself, you are stronger than you think.

Today, I hung out with my stoner friends all day/night (who also drink quite a bit). They smoked four separate times, passing around joints, everyone smoking but me. The smell was tempting, the social ritual was tempting, but I didn't give in. I'm feeling really proud of myself. My friend handed the joint out to me, a couple of inches from my face, and I said no. That's pretty great.

I am even happier to report-- they gave me absolutely no shit about abstaining and didn't ask me if I wanted a hit (or drink) more than once. Demanded no explanations, no weird looks, nothing. I know the general gist here can be that stoner friends leave or isolate you the second you quit, and that's not to say that doesn't happen because it clearly does from many stories posted here, but sometimes people surprise you. Everyone was drinking and smoking all day, I partook in none of it, and they didn't bat an eye. We still had a great time: belly aching laughter, a lot of love, and plans to do it again. It was exactly what I needed after a week+ of withdrawal.

Just realized I made it 30 days!! It feels like a lifetime


I've been struggling to quit for some time now (I've been smoking since 21, almost 10 years I'm just now realizing). At most I'd make it few weeks here and there, maybe one or two months before I end up giving in. It wasn't an every day thing (I'm a musician and I CANNOT perform while high hahaha) but through the years my usage became more frequent, and then with the quarantine I had wayyyy more free time and almost no responsibilities so the opportunity to use all the time was just there, and so I did.

We'll anyway a month ago while playing some gigs up in Denver of all places I was stuck in a hotel room for a few days without much transportation and decided to just hole up and toss the habit for good. Let me tell you those 3 days were ROUGH. A very deep depression hit me immediately and I hated EVERYTHING. Usually when this hits me I escape with a hit, but this time I wouldn't, or couldn't. 

 It seemed/seems different from previous attempts, where I would tell myself I needed to quit but... not FOREVER, you know? Like the idea of giving it up for eternity was horrifying and unconscionable. Weed and sex was definitely a thing, too. How could I ever untangle the two? 

Maybe I realized it was fucking up my creativity and overall happiness in a profound way, or maybe it was the slew of double-bookings, forgotten/procrastinated parking tickets and insurance bills that blew up in my face, but I told myself I had to choose between my passion (music) or my vice. It  suddenly and finally became very obvious I couldn't do both. 

Long story short I feel way better than I have in years, I've replaced weed with more practicing and writing, reading and a ton of biking which I love, and some working out... Finished a 100k bike rally today! I never would've thought that was possible. Not gonna lie I'm terrified of the future and that somehow I'll slip and start smoking again - being a musician means I'm around it ALL THE TIME -- but the haze is gone and I feel much more confident in myself 🤞🤞

I've (27f)  been trying to quit for a while now. Compared to others on this subreddit, my husband (27m) and I aren't the heaviest smokers. We have had it down to 2 bong rips per night for each of us (aka one bowl in our bong) and that's been good. Lately, I've picked up some new freelance clients (I work from home) and it's been challenging me more and more. It's gotten to the point where I will smoke during the day to take the edge off my work anxiety, but then I'm left reeling from the high and unwilling to do much. There's also the emotional strain that comes along with this disappointment in myself. 

I've expressed this to my partner and how I want to stop cold turkey. I just don't feel like this substance is serving me the way it used to. It irritates me that on top of all the work I have to do, I am also having to battle with my own willpower not to smoke at home. He also doesn't ""approve"" of midday smokes, so it can be a way to passive-aggressively get back at him if I'm upset, which also isn't helpful.

**The Main Problem**

When I tell him I want to quit, he adopts this as his plan too. Solidarity is fine, but he does it in the way of ""I want to smoke...but not alone. So it's ok. I'll be ok."" and it makes me feel bad. He also gives me this wounded, martyr look that just grates my nerves. I don't want to force him into a decision he's not ready for, and I also don't like my choices affecting him like this. He knows I'm an empath and HSP, so part of me wonders if this is a manipulation tactic to keep me from changing. I don't know. I've been going in circles trying to quit, and it just feels impossible.

My partner also has a really high-pressure sales job. Changes to his mental well being, or overall attitudes can really impact his sales, and our income. I don't want to force him into a decision he's not ready for. 

Overall, I just want to feel the clarity of being sober. I want to get really into a book and remember it. Everything big and important I've accomplished in my life has been sans weed (graduating college, getting married, getting my first job, a big move). I'm also quite ashamed of my habit. I'm from the Bible Belt, and although I live in a more accepting place now I can't shake the guilt I have over depending on it. I know this plant has medicinal qualities, but the shame mainly comes from how I've been using it recently. I've healed greately from my CPTSD and I'm excited to see what the world is like without this dependence.

I got on a health kick, and it seemed like a great alternative to booze. I was living on my own, working and boxing to pass the time and get in shape. At first, my relationship with MJ was a good one. I curtailed my boozing, I rediscovered my love for music and sex was amazing when MJ was involved. The conversation really seemed to flow as well. Everything was just a tad better, I guess. A tad more interesting, more unusual when MJ was with me. 

When my assignment in Cameroon ended, MJ came with me to my next gig. I liked to party with her, play cards, watch documentaries all weekend. And music. I always had music with me whenever MJ came around. I went through two divorces, MJ was there for me. Lost jobs and business partners. She was there. Soothing. Telling me to pay it all no mind. She came around everyday now. On the weekends, we woke up together. Ordered food. Watched movies. Made Spotify playlists. Stayed in and smoked. She didn't like me going out on my own. She always came along. When I was with my kids, she taged along as well. I took her on countless plane rides. I would consume it to pass the time. To be silly and watch a movie. She was there. Always there. 

Now I can't remember myself with out her. I would even bring her to my therapist meetings. I am 45. I want to end this relationship. I want to be on my own. Remer what food tastes like when she is not around. Going on a trip or an adventure without having to bring her along. She slows me down when I hangout with my kids. She always wants to stay in and chill, while they want to go out there. Experience the colors of life with their dad. I want to join them for that. I don't want to bring her around them. I think she clouds the relationship with them a bit. In May I left her for for couple of weeks. She didn't seem to mind. I was on my own. Facing things I didn't care to face. She is good at that, making sure you didn't have to face what you didn't want to face. 

When I got back, we hangout. She is the same. Clingy. Inserting herself in every facit of my life. Wrapping herself around me. Whispering to stay with her a while. To chase the good times we had. But, I am moving on. I am thanking her for the times we had. But, I outgrew this relationship. I want to be on own. I want to experience that. It's a great and fascinating world out there.

I'm on day 18 (smoked for 5 years everyday age 17-22) and going through an intense depressive period still. I realize how quitting weed, doesn't necessarily solve any of my problems, since i have been heavily depressed, anxious and suicidal since before i even started to smoke. Quitting weed has left me extremely isolated since many of my friends are still smoking and caught up in escapism. I feel like i have destroyed my life so much already that it's impossible to bounce back, and my friends who don't smoke are just on a different path with careers, girlfriends and living in their own apartments, while i had to move back to my parents and quit my job because my mental health was getting so bad.

 I live with my parents in a small apartment in the middle of the capital and i'm super anxious about going outside because you can't find a peaceful spot no matter where you go. I'm very dysmorphic and going outside just fills me with anxiety and paranoia. Therefore i just feel stuck in my room and i can't even get a break from intense anxious thoughts that very much border on the suicidal. 

I have my own theory about my mental health and i think i'm dealing with dysmorphia, depression, anxiety, ADD and weed withdrawals that just enhance all of this - but my psychiatrist tells me that i have to be atleast 3 months sober to actually start treating these symptoms because according to the guidelines of psychiatry you can't diagnose anyone who are clouded up by withdrawals. 

So basically i'm completely broke, stuck in my parents place, can't really go outside because it feels horrible and i'm told that i can't get any help for months. To top this off its in the middle of the summer, so the heat is making it so uncomfortable. All i do is pretty much reading posts in r/leaves because it helps me to know that many others are dealing with similar problems and i'm not the only one whos ""going crazy"". I have tried to quit before and reached 3 months a year ago before relapsing intensely for the past year - so its also very depressing to know that i'm in an even shittier situation now than i was the first time i quit. 

First time i quit i had a lot of motivation to better my life and change my habits - but this time i'm just horribly depressed and watching all my friends getting further ahead, or on the flipside - getting further involved with drugs to deal with their problems is just a lot to handle for me since i can't stop thinking about other peoples situation also.

Just wanted to share this since no one i know can relate to all this. I'm glad i found this subreddit and its at least relieving to read about how this is a more common phenomenon that i thought, because it's not talked about among my friends and family. It also really opened my eyes to how addictive weed really is, and how alot of people saying stuff like ""its just a plant bro"" ""there are no withdrawals"" ""weed helps me with anxiety"" are probably still living a lie or atleast just very different from myself.

I just know that smoking weed will certainly set me back even further in my progress and i just want to  encourage other people to stay sober and realise that weed is in fact ""the devils lettuce""",25,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.905923}"

Crazy dreams, sweats, irritability, headaches, insomnia, the works. Does not help that my lower back issues are hampering my usual exercise routine. Was having a super productive day (who knew quitting made you more focused) in the office at home. And was helping my wife clean out some in the basement for an upcoming reno. Lots going on. I come across my grinder in the file cabinet (its 22 years old and is wooden - thing is an antique compared to these modern metal grinders with all the compartments etc) and wouldn’t you know it there was a good amount of weed all ready for a nice little pinner in there! Immediately I start looking for papers, thinking “lets party!” I’ve been good, so help me, I was thinking of ways to smoke in an pop can (was never a pipe/bong guy) it was pathetic how I was searching in old luggage, toiletries for papers, I even thought of driving to the gas station or going to my neighbour for papers! All this while trying to put the kids to bed. 

Then I stopped searching and leaned against the kitchen counter and breathed. And breathed some more. I held my cats. Hugged my kids. Talked to my wife about the weekend plans. Tidied up my desk, cleaned the dishes and the kitchen, had a hot shower and slept sweaty and woke up on day 13 at 3:40 am. I found the grinder and cleaned it out - threw out the weed into the cat litter trash - litter locker, figuring it would be a place that I would  not go through to pick through. 

For those that have read this and are struggling, toss your stash and breathe some. Cravings will pass but it does not leave you entirely! It’s your responsibility to be sober. That does not mean it is easy.

I didn’t really realize it, because obviously when I woke up I was much better than I had been during the panic attack, but since around then I’ve just felt like I haven’t really been /in/ my own life, moreso just watching it happen. I’ve felt so disconnected from people and places around me. 

I stopped smoking for a little while, but then I had a traumatic event happen which kept the derealization going without me smoking, and then I went back to it anyways.

In 2015 I quit smoking bud, started to exercise and even began a grad school program.  The first week off was real rough back in 2015. But after 6 months or less I was fully focused on the self improvement grind and never craved it again....

My main motivation in 2015 was mostly financial, I just got fired from my shit dead end job. Other motivations were to have more energy to focus on grad school and self care. But the real reason was I had no money coming in.  

Unemployment proved to be a great way to kick start new habits and break old ones. My personal growth during those 5 years was great, finished my masters and found an amazing job in my desired field. And have greatly increased my baseline fitness.

And then there was COVID!

March 2020, I have my great job, ( for which I am lucky for)  but as we all know the world went to shit.  (Especially here in NYC)

So I figured what if I call the dude.  I got the money! For the first 2 months of lockdown I practice great self control. Only one small bowl in the evenings.  

By the summer of 2020 I was back to my pre 2015 usage. The addict brain took over again.  I rationalized that my main reason for quitting in 2015 was no longer valid as my personal finances greatly improved.  Wake and bakes, going to (zoom) work stoned. Again I needed to toke up to catch zzz.  By September 2020 I was had to return to my workplace in person as which was very stressful.  (I teach in an elementary school).

New Years 2021,  time to make a resolution, I tried to quit again.  I didn't like being hooked so I tried to quit.  I didn't really flesh out my motivation beyond that.  Withdrawal was terrible, no appetite, no sleep.  I tapped out after only 4 days and quickly returned to my high consumption (btw 1-2 oz/month). January 2021 was a very stressful time!

About 5 weeks ago I got my first pandemic cold.  I am fully vaxxed.   But still of course I freaked out and got tested, covid negative, thank god.  Just a shitty summer cold.  Through the course of my illness kept smoking as I would have pre 2015.  The lungs of a 30 something aren't the lungs of a 20 something.  

I coughed up the terrible black shit day after day for like 10 days.  My cold was steady improving but the cough was gnarly, and getting worse!

So I decided to quit..

This time no withdrawals, no prob sleeping, or eating.  This confounded my previous periods of cessation.  

Now what is different about this time that I didn't feel  shit withdrawal.  I have some theories but I really don't know.

My main motivation is to never cough black shit again.  My other two times I quit was either financial, or it time to pick a new years resolution ( because that's what people are supposed to do).

Perhaps not wanting to cough up black shit is more motivating and I therefore did not have withdrawal symptoms?

Time for year theories-- in 2015 and this past new year I tried to quit in the winter.  This most recent time it's the summer.  I am a very active and fit person, but in the summer I always dial up to 11.  Biking to the beach swimming, etc. Biking 30 plus miles per day, swimming about 1-2 miles per day.  ( I work in education and have summers off: ) so no work stress too!

Level of physical activity theory, more active less withdrawal?

I firmly believe marijuana is a beautiful and powerful plant that many people can use symbiotically in moderation.  My addict brain has shown me I am not capable of moderation.  Lucky hangovers have prevented me from having the same affinity with alcohol.

My addict brain will have to settle for coffee!

I also know many people who quit do have withdrawal. I have in the past, but not this time. Perhaps my theories can help ease the symptoms of anyone going through withdrawal.  Maybe I just got lucky.

it’s just time to put it to rest once & for all, start seeking improvement in your life. don’t look at this withdrawal process like a hassle, look at it in the positive light that you’re smart / strong enough to give up a negative habit in your life, not many people can do that - especially if they’re not forced too.

I’ve been smoking  for 11 years, chronically for the past 9 of them. Throughout that time my daily habit evolved from late night dirty bong rips and nickel bags to 7-8 two gram blunts (dutchmasters, baby!) and the occasional night of frosty dabs. I’ve lost so many years to the complacency that comes with this habit. I’ve lost so many friends, missed so many opportunities. 

But that’s over now. I’ve reclaimed my time going forward, I’ve reclaimed my mental health and finally have some semblance of control over my depression. It’s like night and day.

Once upon a time I was an extremely angry and violent child who lived in a constant cycle of abuse and self obsession. After the only constant in my life left me (for  good reason) I decided to smoke for the first time which I had I strongly opposed prior to. I can honestly say that weed saved my life, it granted me to be introspective, it allowed me to register empathy. But most importantly smoking pot allowed me to slow down and just enjoy the moment. 

So as any young boy with poor impulse control would do, I decided to make it my life. And so I did. I was the plug, I worked at the smoke shop, I had access to the most beautiful bud and wax I could ever dream of. Everything young me could ever want (sans a savings account).
But my depression spiraled, my social anxiety was out of control, panic attacks I could set my watch to and worst of all I had no ability to regulate my suicidal ideations. 

So after two years of failed “moderate use” and a horrible panic attack due to worsening health issues I’ve finally managed to cut the habit entirely and besides my near constant vivid stress dream I am better for it. 
I feel so much better, so much more productive. Everything is looking up.

Yes it’s your environment no you don’t need to cut off all your friends.

1. Make the decision to stop- no really, when you finish your last bud and you actually want to stop make the decision consciously and THROW OUT ALL YOUR SMOKING CRAP.
2. In that same breath delete all your dealers from your phone, delete any messages that come through.
3. Get real- get angry remember your why. I mean why do you want stop?
4. The next day will be the hardest. Even the day after I did all the points above I searched my house high and low for some bud.
5. DO SOMETHING. I didn’t do any of the boring stuff like “clean my house” but instead I went on a date just to take my mind away.
6. Well done you’ve now gone 24 hours.
7.  Decline events where people will be smoking and tell them you’ve stopped and that you feel amazing even if you don’t.
8. Remember your why. It may seem boring but soon you’ll be so much better if only you guys knew :/
9. Go 48hours for me I joined the gym as I cannot afford both weed and gym.
10. Feel amazing and don’t look back for now you’re on to great things.

i think i'm prone to addiction, just in general. i think the combination of mental illness and trauma and environmental factors predispose me to it. i was addicted to diet soda at one point, for example, i drank 6-8 cans a day at one point. weed feels much the same, in that it's something i do in excess, spend a lot of time and money on, and can't seem to control. it definitely got worse during the pandemic/quarantine because time lost meaning, i could smoke whenever i wanted because everything was at home or cancelled and now... now i can't stop? i have to resist the urge to hit the bong before work at 8am, i keep trying to think up ways to smoke at work even though my new job is definitely something that requires attention to detail and accuracy... it just feels like a lot of red flags. i quit for about 4 months and then had a physical injury that left me in so much pain that i started again and now i can't stop (again). 

i'd like to say it started out socially but that isn't really true. i picked it up while in college and working a stressful job where i always had to be ""on"". i was struggling in school even before the weed, but weed certainly didn't help. but it felt nice to feel... nothing, i guess? it made my brain be quiet, y'know? but i'm realizing that it's just a way of numbing myself and not having to think or process anything. i can get high and lay in bed doing nothing, not even scrolling mindlessly on my phone, for hours. 

i'm considering smoking herbal cigs or using a nicotine free flavored vape, because i like the physical act of smoking. it gives me an excuse to step away from my desk, is a pleasant sensory experience, can sometimes be social, etc. but i don't think i can handle weed even sometimes, i think it's something i need to take a clean break from entirely. 

i live with folks who smoke and im nervous about that, because while we smoke the same amount it's not my decision to make on their behalf. im nervous ill be too tempted. 

i don't really know what im looking for here. kind words? support? reassurance that it'll be okay? im fortunate and will have to opportunity to process all these things with a therapist but until then im just sort of... sitting with it

I’ve also been playing guitar for about a decade. I would never want to play music when I was high, always opting for YouTube videos, video games. Every time I would try to quit, if I made it long enough I would start playing my guitar again. But I always went back, “just for a weekend” which would turn into 3-6 months of morning, noon, and night getting high.

On July 5 I decided that enough was enough and chose to move on from weed for good. I am grateful to have a plan and support and I am ready to move into another chapter of my life. I also have so many things to look forward to, like my music again.

Yesterday, the music finally came back. First song I played was the old western classic “Big Iron”. Now it’s time to finish all the original songs that I’d left unfinished in my previous haze. 

I am so glad to have the music back. I hope today that you all get to enjoy whatever it is that you got back when you quit too.",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8737888}"

This is my first ever post done here on reddit, which I believe it'll give me a sense of relief of satisfaction by sharing it with you.  


My history with weed has started 10 years ago as a way of rebelling and trying to be a cool kid, only to in later years to realize it probably made me look more of a stupid dumb kid, some years after acquiring the habit of being a stoner I've got into dealing  weed and hash as I've always had connections for dealers and clients, usually as a side hustle, but in later years It became my main source of income.  
In March 2021 I had the opportunity of working on a project doing the mapping of roads for a big tech company, we were in France for a month and while I was there I didn't smoke any ( although occasionally I would try to score some, fortunately it never happened) , but then unexpectedly we moved to the Netherlands were weed is legal, so as we arrived at the hotel on the first day, a colleague already had picked up some from a coffeeshop, and I was so baked the first times smoking it again, was like smoking for the first time!  


Whilst staying there for 3 month all I could do was smoke unceasingly with a few other colleagues, by the last month I was already smoking on shift almost everyday, leading for my performance to go down and making lots of mistakes which ultimately led for my dismissal of the project.  
I felt like I needed to have a proactive attitude in dealing with this issue, as It's messing with most important aspects of my life, such as relationships, mental health and physical health etc.  
But, as soon as I've had returned I'd already had a batch ready to sell to some regular costumers, seems like I'd fallen back into my old default mode, making me even more anxious lately.  


Recently I've tested positive for covid-19, and although my symptoms are very mild, I'll still be in isolation for 10 days until I've a negative test.  
I've decided to deal with this issue now rather than later, and do my second ever attempt of leaving weed, hopefully it'll last more than a month this time, and I hope to get back to my original self, and thrive on the natural joy of life whilst dealing with it's ups and down without the assistance of weed to numb me out.  


I'm on day 2 of quitting weed, cigarettes, and caffeine, It's a full on detox that I am willing to go through.  


Thank you all for your motivational stories, and wish you all the courage to overcome this  toxic relationship with weed.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45712927}"

It was my coping mechanism as a parent and business owner I have been using for 4 years and it is what got me through my post partum depression. When I smoke I don’t feel pain or suffering and it stops the anxiety in my body. It brought me comfort and relaxed me in times of stress and anxiety. But weed is the cause of my infertility issues and I am addicted i barely felt high anymore so I have decided to stop to grow my family and take control of my addiction hopefully find alternative ways to be less stressed out.

Finding this subreddit has really helped in terms of hearing other people’s stories and how they feel as time passes. Currently the main symptoms I’ve been feeling include awful migraines, cravings, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, no appetite, nausea, and an increase in depression. This morning I woke up with a horrible migraine, fell back asleep, then woke up hours later feeling intense rage I haven’t felt in a long time. Does anyone have any advice in terms of dealing with these side effects? It’s hard enough having mental health symptoms I struggle with on the daily and then going through withdrawal symptoms on top of it. It makes me want to push everyone away. Some distractions I’ve turned to include art, since it’s a part of my career, but since I’m trying to sell my art and getting nowhere, it can add to the feelings of intense frustration and wanting to relapse.

I get to enjoy dreams every night. 
I can read and accomplish tasks without staring mindlessly high into space for hours at a time. 
I can write and turn in papers for grad school. 

But best of all—for me, is that I can approach the deities of Radha-Krishna completely clean and sober. I’ve always been attracted to the Hare Krishna devotee lifestyle. Reading the Bhagavad Gita As it Is has completely changed my life but being high and drunk weighed heavily on my conscience for years. I felt like I couldn’t approach God while high, so I wouldn’t at all. It was a very spiritually depressing time for me. Now that I’m clean, I can chant Hare Krishna, offer gifts to the deities, and read the Srimad Bhagavatam without guilt. It’s the most beautiful nectar my soul has ever tasted and I can do it thanks to being clean and sober. 

In this way, my journey of sobriety and spirituality has just begun.

I had a breakthrough in therapy last night, where I realized that all this time I've believed that I was using weed to self medicate for anxiety, and I am, but I now realize that anger is the bigger issue. I have been using weed to control my anger, and without it, I feel like I'm going to explode. 

People ask me what I'm angry at/about, and it's just everything. I'm in NYC and a lot of people have stopped wearing their masks on the subway. I'm angry at them. It was also just legalized here, so I can't walk two feet without walking through a cloud of it. I'm angry at every person I see smoking on the street. I work with a bunch of conservatives who constantly parrot Tucker Carlson talking points at work, and I'm angry at them. The guy who sits right next to me talks all fucking day, constantly makes Dad jokes, and makes the same ones EVERY SINGLE DAY (seriously, he's made the same stupid Dad jokes every day for the last YEAR AND A HALF (I had to work in an office throughout the entire pandemic, despite the fact that it was illegal, and there's a whole host of stupid reasons for that that I won't get into here). He also makes vaguely sexual jokes that don't quite reach the level of ""Sexual Harassment' (we're both straight men, if it matters), but are unprofessional and annoying, especially when it's every day. I'm angry at him. He also makes comments disparaging democrats. He just lacks professional decorum. 

My anger has risen to the level of rage, and I'm constantly finding myself having violent fantasies about the subjects of my anger. I'm not going to act on them; my anger does not outwardly manifest, I keep it all bottled up inside, nobody who knows me really well would even know that I have anger issues. I feel like it's probably worth noting here that I grew up with a Father who was basically a rage monster, and his anger definitely DID outwardly manifest, and I was often the target of it, although he never hit me. My Father, at 72 years old, is now also a very heavy cannabis user, and although he would never admit it, I think he is also using it to self medicate for anger.

I now realized that I was using to control the blinding rage I feel every day. Without the weed, I have nothing to keep the anger in check, and I feel like it's poisoning me from the inside. But more importantly, I now realize that this anger is an imminent threat to my continued sobriety. I'm only on Day 10. 

Has anyone else dealt with anger issues - chronic anger issues - but also early-sobriety anger issues? If so, I'm looking for some pointers and tips, things that have worked for the community here.

\- Stopped stressing about doomsday and actually just started preparing, but with less all-consuming anxiety.

\- Created the most awesome work from home set up. Looks like a stock trader set up.

\- Picked up the guitar and loop pedal again.

\- Best sleep. Instantly fall asleep. Having dreams again.

\- Dreams are no longer scary as f.

\- Not avoiding my GF because I would rather be high.

1. My problem wasn’t weed per se, it was just maladaptive responses to stress. I started seeing a therapist right away and she has made me see that is the root of why I habitually smoked. BetterHelp provided a means to link me to a therapist right away. Highly recommended. 
2. Withdrawals were lessened by switching from smoking to edibles for a month or two before quitting. I knew I wanted to be healthier and felt the physical effects of smoking cessation right away. Mental health has improved dramatically since moving on from edibles as well. 
3. If you were using marijuana to deal with anxiety like I was, you might want to consider lessening caffeine intake as well. I switched off coffee at the same time as I quit weed and now just drink tea. I find it gives me much more even energy throughout the day.

I'm really trying my best to get it out of my system by exercising and eating healthy, but I still have a terrible anxiety. It's not even that much because of withdrawal, but more because I'm constantly thinking about the upcoming test. The hardest thing for me has been regulating emotions, since I ehhh... cry a lot for long periods of time, and I'm no longer able to just reset my head by getting high.

Any words of reassurance would help a ton, but I also want to give tips for those who are struggling during week 1. Be as busy as possible. Clean your apartment, do some stretching, go for a walk, anything. Any time when I sit down and start to think about smoking, I get physical anxiety and/or cravings.

For 3 months, I was better, I hadn’t touched weed, the cravings seemed to subside and my bank account and general quality of life was better off for it.

However, last year things got hard.. Due to personal issues I started using again and made the typical excuses I’m sure you’re all familiar with: “it’s only one bag, won’t do anything”, “oh now I’ve got a full bag of tobacco, I’ll just buy enough weed to get rid of it so it’s not wasted”. 

It was a constant spiral. Now I’ve spent so much money that it’s effecting my chances of moving to the apartment of my dreams.. Now I’m back to square one, another wake up call made me realise that this *IS* an addiction and cannabis *IS* a drug, no matter how much it’s normalised in the media these days.

Moderation does not work for people like us. All it took was one bag to start the cycle again and once again this drug has left me in a black hole that consumes my relationships, future, and the people around me. I need to stop, not just for myself but for everyone who depends on me.

I’ve thrown out everything I needed in order to smoke and this time I must be stronger.

It has been a very bumpy road in the beginning: sleepless nights, emotional rollercoaster, lungs purification, feeling lost and alone.. At crunch times I was constantly repeating to myself that the addiction was leaving my body and exorcism was being performed. ""Just 5 minutes, 5 minutes more, I've got this...""

Incredibly, it worked! Since then I've changed cities, learned a new language, developed new hobbies, made new acquaintances, dropped 12 kg, found how to be at peace with myself.

Despite all those benefits, it felt like there is something missing. And then it happened.. I've decided to treat myself with a poof on my birthday. Needless to say, next 10 days the addiction returned with new unbelievable strength. Spent over 500 GBP in those 10 days. One would think that I have given up? Actually, not this time, somehow all that groundwork made in the previous 9 months was not fruitless. There was actually a voice saying: ""STOP! Look where it is leading you to?"" This time I've listened to this voice and not to the demon inside. Since then been 3 months free and counting the whole period. It was just a slip.

""Progress, not perfection.""

Today I feel more confident about myself and have refused several occasions to rewake the demon inside. Real-life just feels much better.

Thank you each and a single one in r/leaves, you were a cornerstone to my resurrection from 10 years of addiction.

Good luck. You've got this!

So…I’ve kind of found out some things about myself. I don’t think weed is what was the problem. The problem was myself the whole time. Weed was an escape to mask problems that I wasn’t working on. It was a way to just put those problems on a back shelf and just…not worry. On that note…

1. I’m back in school! Yay masters degree here I come!

2. Still working. Steady income is so much fun to have. 

3. Proper medication management with my doctors + bi-weekly therapy to help with my depression/anxiety issues. The anxiety was a big one when it came to my former use. I’m very routine orientated and if I start doing something often I have to do it everyday otherwise my whole day feels….terrible. Like out of alignment if that makes sense? That’s EXACTLY what happened with pot usage, and then the constant smoking led to tolerance which led to the INSANE amount I was using before…yeah. It’s amazing what therapy can reveal about yourself sometimes….

4. Healthy eating + workout. Around May I really started to get serious about it because I was at my heaviest (197) and I was not happy at all with how it affected my body. I’ve lost over 20 pounds already (175 yay)

more than anything, i thought i missed “the vibe.” i enjoyed smoking socially but i honestly enjoyed it more alone, the headspace id get into. but i just have realized tonight that it’s not the weed that made that possible, it just made it easier. i spend so much time alone, for better and for worse, voluntarily and at times involuntarily- but rarely any of that time actually in my own presence. being comfortable in my own presence, smoking brought that out of me. but after reflecting a lot today & going through a lot of temptation/ missing the “good old days” i had smoking, i felt that feeling without being high. and it was amazing. 

been reading posts on this sub for awhile n it’s helpful to see others experiences. keep going. i was really surprised that for myself, the first month and a half seemed very easy, my mind felt so fucked when i’d smoke, like my body was literally rejecting it, there was no desire to continue. but the last couple weeks i’ve been feeling nostalgic for my “old life.” i’m 20 & smoked for the first time at 15, smoked an outrageous amount daily from age 16 on, minus one year of probation summer after junior year till graduation. i wanted to take breaks so many times but only was able to that one year, when legal repercussions were involved. my fear of going back to juvie (lowkey a traumatic experience for me, even though it was just for the weekend) was the only thing to overpower my addiction lol. 

i’m gonna keep going. today’s a day i can say i don’t even want to smoke again. it comes and goes in waves. growth isn’t linear as they say, & it’s true. learning some lessons can be a spiral- you keep coming back to the same thing, but with new knowledge, a new perspective, new experiences you can apply for a deeper understanding. i think of this in terms of changing your way of thinking, which i think is key in freeing yourself for good of something like addiction.

My favorite routine is to smoke, meditate, do yoga, and then play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

My plan for when the pandemic ends was to move to Japan to teach English. I taught in Korea before and had a great time. But sometimes I worry about moving because there won't be any trees there. I think the fact that I feel like it would be tough to live without it might be a sign I'm addicted.

Anyways, just curious if anyone has any opinion on whether life can be as good without weed? If so, is there anything in particular you've found the fill that hole in you?

This time though, I have a lot of support. I verbalized to my husband, and his family since we are living with them, that I am doing this (they all knew I smoked and often toked with me). This helps take the shame away and helps me feel empowered. I'm so lucky to be surrounded by such a kind, non-judgmental family.

It’s been triggering for me these past couple of days because someone moved in who’s pretty much the spitting image of my mother personality wise. I moved out of the apartment and to the recovery house to get away from her and now I’m in the exact same boat. 

My mom is disabled and has been my entire life. She’s been playing the victim card ever since her diagnosis and hasn’t stopped. She has RA and bunch of complications from it. From all the research I’ve done into RA is that if you don’t keep active and exercise regularly then you’ll be in constant pain. My mom sits in her chair, eats, watches TV, and plays games on her laptop all day long and does nothing to even take care of herself anymore. I was doing all the chores, cooking all the meals, and even clipping her toenails. It was horrible and disgusting. She’s a hoarder so the apartment was cluttered with things and constantly messy. I can’t live in a mess. I just couldn’t handle it and anymore felt that I needed to escape. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to get clean in that toxic environment.

Hey all, I guess I'm on yet another Day 1. I used to smoke all the time, quit drinking (mostly, except when experimenting with moderation) about 12 years ago. Still smoked sometimes (when I could get it) after that, then when my son was in middle school and I found HIS stash, I was like, yeah... time to quit for real.

So I did, made simpler by the fact that it's not legal where I am and I never had a regular connection or supplier.

And then in the last 4 or 5 years, I've just struggled with sobriety. I've gone through experimenting with a number of other lightweight substances,  most recently Delta 8.

Delta 8 is proving to be a tough one for me, although I'm only coming here after about a month of regular use. It's easy to get, the high is more manageable than with regular weed, and it works, in terms of providing a little euphoric bubble.

What are the downsides? The same ones we all know. Not wanting to socialize so that I can use it. Wondering about an hour after I've taken it when I should take my next dose to keep buzzing, vegging out on the couch doing nothing, foggy-headed in the morning, and wishing my day away until I get to take some more. Not doing any creative work (I've been doing a lot of writing in the last 3 years). Life on it's own terms not feeling like enough.

So, I don't know. I KNOW how good sobriety is, I KNOW that I've only hit my life and career goals BECAUSE I got sober, so... why do I keep messing around wanting to find a substance that will altar my state but not have consequences? Ugh. I've done SO FREAKING MUCH back and forth with this over the years. Super bored with myself and replaying this particular loop over and over.

My aunt's dog fell and sliced open her paw at the park which required surgery and she now, basically, has to be cared for around the clock. Last night she was in so much pain that she cried all night. None of us got any sleep.

This triggered a major depressive episode in me and caused me to have some pretty awful insomnia. I woke up crying and I continued to cry most of the day. I did, however, get on my Peloton for 30 minutes and did a few weights. This helped boost my confidence a little, but it didn't clear the depressive clouds over my head.

My aunt and I had a great routine going where we walked the dogs every morning and now I don't have that. I am finding that any change in my routine tends to send me for loops. Really, the depression is over nothing, although my brain continues to tell me its because no one cares about my problems and everyone is sick of hearing about my withdrawal symptoms.

I am finding it hard to be positive, but I am going to continue to push through and recognize that my emotions are at a 10 right now and they wont stay that way forever. Its hard to be patient when you're so uncomfortable, but I'm sure many of you can absolutely relate.

it was day 3 of smoking (yesterday) and i was already anxious when i lit up my joint. i felt euphoria and pain relief immediately but it didn't last long. i started to panic. i tried to ground myself but that some how pushed me fattened into a panic. i lost control of my mind and body, something i had never experienced before while smoking. (keep in mind this was dispensary weed, it wasn't laced.) i started to fade in and out of consciousness and was freaking out. i blacked out once, came too and then ran to a safe spot. i remember sitting down in a chair, still feeling racey, confused, out of control, and way too damn high. next thing i know i wake up on the ground. i passed out and fallen out of my chair. it was so fucking scary. it's hard to describe what i experienced because i felt like i had taken some type of hard core drug. it's what i imagined speed would feel like. (idk if that's accurate but that's how i perceived my experience.) it was terrifying. i thought i was about to die. genuinely i didn't think i would survive this experience. 
and you know what the absolute worst part is? i want to smoke again. after all of that. after the blackout episode leading to me unconscious on the ground. after a severe panic attack that i thought was leading me to death. i still want to smoke. and that's why i have to stop. here's to day 1 (again)

Ultimately, the question that continuously arises within myself, is that I don't know, for certain, whether the path I continue on in life, has been directed or affected by my pot consumption, and has my usage made me lazier throughout my college/post-college years.

I’m actually amazed. So far, every night I’ve been asleep within an hour and am waking up a lot less. Still getting the messed up dreams of course, but I’m getting way more sleep than I have the other times I’ve tried to quit. It’s low-key actually working and as I said to my gf after the first night ‘me and this blanket will never be apart’.

I know these things aren’t cheap, but with all the weed you’re hopefully not buying it should be possible.

I quit weed along w nicotine a little over a month ago. Over a weekend visiting some friends I thought it would be fine to give myself a pass and smoke some with friends. I had a good time and didn't have an urge to smoke the night I got home, but I had made the mistake of not tossing my stash thinking I'd be able to use in moderation after a break. This was false. I don't even remember how it happened honestly. I think my rationale (sounds kinda silly in hindsight) was that drinking had lowered my vibrations and I needed to bring them back up. It felt kinda true because I had been feeling so good over the previous month sober until the weekend's hangover came and I felt like I was back to square 1. I also kept saying to myself ""you've done so great for quitting nicotine!! a little weed is ok!"" but it quickly took over all my thoughts again. I spent the work days wanting to smoke and evenings after smoking wishing I hadn't and thinking about how I wanted to quit.

Anyway, smoked for about a week anytime I could, telling myself each day would be the last, but today I did it! Threw it all away this time and the worst day is behind me (wasn't even that bad, a little irritable but honestly feel better overall)

The problem is, even if you are able to function and make progress in life, it’s very clear to me how impactful heavy consumption is in mitigating a person’s ultimate potential. I’ve tried to quit many times and have been unsuccessful, but I finally reached the point where I am tired of weed having control over my life. My anxiety and depression have been awful lately, and I know that heavy THC levels in my brain are only contributing to my issues (was smoking carts, dabs, bud, literally anything that tested high). I have a lot more I could say but I will save that for a later time.

My dad had been really sick and I’d been nothing but self absorbed, he needed me and I couldn’t be there.

Well I saw a psychiatrist and now I’m off to the hospital for a month worth of in-treatment.  That’s how bad it’s got… I can’t live like this and now I have to do what’s right to get better.

It’s ruined my life and the lives of those around me, it’s not to be fucked with and it can be extremely difficult. I’m lucky that I’m getting help, but it sucks that I have to do this because I have so much regret and anger inside and that’s the tip of the iceberg. Look after yourselves, keep being the wonderful community that you are, but don’t for a second think this isn’t serious or isn’t a real addiction. It is and it needs to be treated a such.

Today is day 3 of me quitting. I haven’t had any massive cravings except randomly a few times during the day or when I’m bored. I mainly decided to quit due to mental health concerns. For about 11 months I have struggled with general anxiety disorder. I have seen a therapist for the past 7 months and have took 5mg of prescription meds for a month and it has now been 2 weeks on 10mg. I’m yet to see any changes in the medication until maybe today. For the past 2 weeks I have had a couple bad panic attacks, and the weed definitely has not helped. All I want is to be my old self again, so quitting had to happen. It will be tough going back next month for my last year of college, so if I get through this month before school starts without smoking, I’m hoping I can very occasionally smoke at school. All in all, mental health was my main concern. It has been hard for me to drive places and see friends and simply leave the house a lot of the time. I was never ever like this.

For some this may sound so dramatic and Not relatable, but for others this is maybe just what you need.

I have been going through PAWS now for the past few months and experiencing really scary symptoms that made me feel like I was losing my sanity. 

My main issues were: memory loss, depersonalisation, loss of concentration, really flat emotions and anhedonia, and no pleasure from anything like sex or eating.

I did some research and found some scientific basis for PAWS. This is basically what I found REALLY simplified:

When you smoke marijuana, obviously neurotransmitters and receptors in your brain are completely overstimulated. When you smoke chronically or abuse the substance, these chemicals adapt and become used to the high quantity of freely available chemicals that flow into the brain from smoking or ingesting cannabis. One of these being “cannaboid receptors” which are directly related to mood, pain, emotions, cognition and memory. So when you quit cannabis, these receptors are deprived and can cause a harsh effect on all of these things. However this is only one example out of the many receptors and neurotransmitters that are out of whack after cannabis abuse.

There was actually a study of rats which focused on the impact of cannabis on the normal rebalance of these receptors which showed the levels of cannaboid activity in their brains resumed to normal within 4 weeks of abstinence. 

The conclusion? These receptors are elastic and can reverse and rebalance. You are not brain damaged and you will get better!

This post may help nobody, or help one person. Either way I feel like understanding the scientific basis for the way I feel makes me a lot more relaxed and eases the self loathing. I hope this offers the same relief to one of you guys",454,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42410293}"

At the end of the day, I'm glad I didn't cave. Instead I cleaned up all the dishes and went for a run. No regrets, as I'm about to head to sleep feeling positive about the day.

Setting the intention when waking up to stay sober can be helpful. I'm a spiritual type of person, and I asked for help and strength to keep me sober today (same as yesterday). I believe it actually helped although I've never done that before. Even if you aren't religious or spiritual, I think when you really truly want to be sober just for that day, you can do it if you just ask to have the strength to do it.

If you are scientific minded, I can shortly explain how this works. Visualising or meditating on your goal for that day (e.g. being sober) makes connections in your brain, which enable that event to happen more effortlessly, because there is a pathway that you create.

So I decided a couple days ago to just take a couple days off, and honestly it’s not going so well. I last smoked Monday night and felt regretful about it, but smoked more before bed to try and help sleep. Yesterday I found I really wanted to smoke around 9:30 PM and decided to force myself not to. I tried to get some exercise instead but had a hard time getting started. Around 10:30 I finally got on my bike and rode to a bar across town for some beer and wings, and when I got home I again craved to smoke but was feeling good from the exercise and good food. But I couldn’t sleep. Not even remotely. I ended up falling back to alcohol because I just couldn’t handle how I felt naturally.

Is this withdrawal? I don’t remember ever having withdrawal before. 

Anyway the temptation to smoke is stronger than ever. I just want to shut my brain off. But I know I’ll regret it. So I’m trying not to.

I had a bit of a headache last night but I'm not sure if it was related. Besides the odd craving, I'm not noticing too much of a difference, which makes me wonder, what exactly was weed doing for me? I'm sure I'll have more insight when the THC is completely out of my system in 60-90 days, though.

This does make me think about when I first I started smoking weed in 2007. I was only 13, and the experiences were almost psychedelic! It was a lot of fun and I felt more creative and imaginative, and it made me feel a little less angsty about the world. Going from that, to feeling like weed doesn't make me feel noticeably different 14 years later is ... interesting. Getting stoned hasn't been ""fun"" like that in a long time, it's just been my normal state.

Typically I get home from work and chat with my sister (who doesn't smoke) while getting high, and yesterday after work the urge was definitely there but I resisted! Then realized it was probably best to remove the temptation and get rid of everything, so I gave my brother-in-law my remaining stash/paraphernalia and threw out the broken bong and mostly-empty dab carts I was saving for a rainy day I guess lol

Quiting weed for me wasn't just stopping using weed. It was much more far reaching and was more about changing my life in general. A lot of work was put in around changing my mindset and general outlook and how I viewed things. I longed for a better life and I knew that not using weed was one of the major obstacles to achieving that.

The expectations I had around quitting prior to this last time were not realistic. Some of the important ones were:

\- Merely quitting weed wasn't going to change my life profoundly.

\- It was going to be a long process to quit and before I would see significant improvements

\- Weed cravings weren't so strong that I couldn't resist them

\- Life wasn't going to be like what life was like shortly after quitting weed

**Profound changes -** Before I use to have this expectation that once I quit weed and had been clean for a couple of weeks that my life would drastically change and things would get better. This wasn't true. Whether it was from weed or just life in general or a combination of the two there were a lot of negative patterns (mostly around my thoughts) that I had developed over the years. I needed to work on this independant of stopping weed. With weed no longer in the picture however I was in a much better position to work through this issues more effectively.

**Long Process -** In the past I thought that after a few weeks I'd basically be free from all the detrimental effects weed caused me. The reality was that it was going to take months - if not years to fully recover from the chemical imbalances weed caused in my brain. For me it took about 6 months of experiencing phases of high anxiety and depression before I really came through the other side and things became more peaceful in my life. Things continue(d) to get better from that point as well.

**Cravings** \- I always had this false belief that weed cravings were so strong that I had to obey them. This is exactly what I did in the past - I always obeyed them to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Its what fueled the addiction. Getting high just to avoid the bad feelings rather than getting high for the sake of getting high. Sometimes the high was just a negative side affect of trying to avoid bad feelings. I didn't always want to be high but I definitely didn't want the bad feelings like uncontrollable mood and aggitation. I had to face those bad feelings for a while and realize that I was in control over whether I consumed weed or not. It came down to just being a choice I had to make for myself if I would smoke weed or not. For me the cravings were mostly made of patterns of behavior instilled in me from years and years of routine weed smoking. It wasn't that bad, not fun, but managable. The worst of this part of it was behind me after 2 or 3 weeks from the day I stopped (June 14th, 2020).

**Life** \- There was this false belief that the way I felt in the weeks and months after quitting weed was how I would feel for the rest of my life. Frankly if that were the case I would have just carried on smoking weed because I wouldn't have been able to sustain my life living that way. The depression and anxiety and negative state in general that I experienced after quitting weed was pretty intense at times and I would not want anyone to live that way. Through my own learning I developed a trust in the process. The process of my brain healing and things gradually and eventually getting better. To use a phrase, things were going to get worse before they got better. They really did get better and it also really did take quite a long time for that to happen (about 6 months for me, as I stated before). Life got better and now I enjoy day to day life. Little things are more appreciated and I get satisfaction from the normal things in life again. My motiviation to do stuff has increased and life feels very much worth living again, its rewarding. There are ups and downs of course and there is a much better balance now.

To summarize all of this it took a long time to recover from having used weed for so long. Weed caused changes to my brain directly and indirectly by influencing my thoughts, behaviors and patterns. It took time for the physical changes to heal and it took a lot of work, effort and patience on my part to fix the pyschological impact and I continue to work on that to this day.

Quitting weed is a lot of work. You need to take steps to change your life to suit a sober lifestyle and start thinking like a sober person. Whatever negative stuff accumulated during your time smoking weed needs to be addressed and dealt with. Its a huge committment and for me having knowledge of what to expect was what really helped me succeed. We all have different personalities and needs, this approached worked for me and it might not suit everyone. Spend time thinking about what you need to be successful and work towards that end.",132,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43831238}"

Two days after that I had a mental breakdown at work, which resulted in me staying home to recuperate. Which was a gigantic trigger for me, since I never have been ""sick"" due to stress/burn-out symptoms, feeling like I failed and being alone at home is way I used to smoke. And one thing let to another.. let's just say I had a big relapse. Smoking several grams of weed a day, from the moment I woke up till the moment I fell into a weed-induced coma. All while gorging on fast food and starring at a screen.

And you know what? I'm grateful for that experience. Because that proved that I was not an ""functional addict"" like I claimed in my first post here. It proved that I was (once again) underestimating my addiction.

That realization thankfully let to action. Tomorrow I'm going to my GP for a referral for treatment. I had that several times before in my life and going back always felt like a failure. It also doesn't help that I'm a mental health care professional as well (for some reason that makes me feel more ashamed, because I feel like I'm supposed to have everything together). But I pushed through that, because I realized that I'm not going to get far without some help, one way or another. I might be able to quit a few days, a few weeks w/e. But if I want to really get my addiction under control, I need help. I need to take my addiction seriously, and that's what I'm doing right now.

So, wanted to make a post here to share, because sharing is also a way to keep in touch with the reality of addiction. And it feels good as well!

Also some advice & tips that helped me so far in the ""physical withdrawal"" phase:

Do a lot of exercise! I'm trying to go for a run twice a week, picked up boxing (going several times a week) and started lifting weights. This helps so much with being tired at the end of the day and it will help you feel healthy in general.

Eat healthy! No more ordering unhealthy food (which saves a ton of money). Just alot of whole grains, fruits and veggies with a daily protein shake.

Use an app that tracks your progress. 

And in general: Don't do activities that you used to do when blazed when you are trying to quit. For me, smoking is always accompanied by gaming, binge eating and watching porn. I have noticed that if I do those things while not being high, I feel like I'm missing something and I just feel shitty about myself. Which results in craving which might lead to another relapse. So limit the amount of screen-time and go for a walk or read a book.

I've tried a bunch of times but don't make it far, maybe a week or two. I have decent self discipline in regards to knowing how to distance my self from temptation, but I always crack eventually when I know there is weed in my house. My best friend is a (semi) functioning alcoholic and stoner and my wife is a casual smoker. How do I deal with this? I don't want my addiction to be a burden on my closest people. I feel like I have no right to dictate their smoking, but I keep relapsing. Should I just buckle down and try to willpower my self through this even if I'm surrounded by people who smoke? I really don't want to turn into a controling spouse or friend, and I don't think ultimatums will do any good. I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut where I'm always the only one in the friend group that wants to cut back on the smoking. Then when I try to stop I succumb to unintentional peer preasure when weed is brought into my house. I haven't bought weed or sought it out for a long time, It's just hard to resist when someone is ripping the bong in your living room.

I purchased a sleep mask to try since the morning light comes right in my window and I thought, perhaps, that was why I was waking up at 5am every morning. Tried it last night and slept right through till my alarm! I was so happy to have gotten (nearly) a full 7 hours. I hadn't previously been a light sleeper, but I am accepting that this may be the new normal. Hopefully, this is the solution!

I also decided to start volunteering at a local dog shelter and yesterday was my first training day. It was nice to be around all the dogs and to take my mind off my situation for a little while. The woman running the rescue was super sweet and I really look forward to spending more time helping out. It feels good to be of service--to do something nice without seeking a monetary reward.

In addition to all that, I think I found a new therapist. My old therapist is not giving me the support I need right now and I feel like the work we were doing has become stagnant. So, I reached out to a local clinic and they will be setting me up with a therapist (hopefully) today. I look forward to a new relationship with someone who can better support my sobriety and mental health.

With that said, I am still experiencing anxiety, depression and a little residual autophobia but I expect, with more time, all of those will continue to improve. Some days are better than others and I am beginning to realize that that is just life.

2021-07-13 23:00:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ojve19/day_2_finding_distractions/,Day 2 - Finding Distractions,"I am a 20 year old male. I smoked daily throughout college and frequently in high school. I remember how confidant I was in my ability to keep my shit together and being high all of the time. I would even say that I could work better high, or ""oh man, I need a few bowls to get through this assignment / work project"". I perpetuated this lie for so damn long. 

Before I became a daily smoker, I was excited about life. I was grabbing at every opportunity thrown my way, and being genuinely thrilled to work long hours busting my ass. There was no downhill spiral, no rapid deterioration of my identity. There was a faintly sloped road, going out to the distance, and eventually down into the ocean. From out on the road, everything seemed flat, I was me, and the marijuana was not impeding that (or so I thought). But as I drove closer and closer, I could see the ocean coming. The growing anxiety, the lack of ambitions, the ever-approaching idea that my life is not what I want it to be. The most ridiculous thing about it all is that with the ocean in sight, I didn't want to turn away, I wanted to keep getting high, to keep making it work. 

Even early on in my addiction, I knew inside that one day I would have to ""grow up"" and stop smoking-- there's a last day for everything. Despite that, I never had any intention on actually stopping. More than anything it was an elaborate marijuana-induced stupor of constantly believing that one day I'll just quit, and that part of me will be gone, and I will once again be a productive human.

I graduated college this past year, and I applied to many PhD programs, and while I got some offers, I knew that I ultimately half-assed the entire process, and was not pleased with my work. More than anything, I knew I could have done so much more-- just if I wasn't so damn high all the time. I finally came to a few conclusions:

1.  I could try to smoke my way through graduate school and probably fail miserably.

2. Somehow pull off getting a PhD stoned knowing that I could have done so much more.

3. Finally take a U-turn on my own road of destruction, and do something I can be proud of.

And I decided I wanted option 3. I didn't want to keep seeing myself accomplish less. I didn't want to keep seeing myself unable to go to a class unless I smoke. I didn't want to keep seeing less of myself and more of the weed, so in 2 hours, I will be 2 days free of the devil's lettuce, and I couldn't be more thrilled.

I planned my quitting to coincide with my move (which I accelerated so I could hopefully have some time getting my head clear). On Monday, I left my college house of stoners and all my goodies behind. Waking up early and driving 10 hours may not have been the best decision in hindsight, but it gave me something to do, which I desperately needed. When things really started getting hard is when I couldn't actually move in to my new place since the only leasing agent left the office early. All the anxiety I was trying to suppress with years of cannabis had suddenly started to boil into a frenzy. I was homeless for the night, with a car completely full of shit, and without any AC for the hot and muggy summer evening. Despite all of this, I had confidence in myself, because for the first time in a long time I was sober.

I ended up staying in a RV park and pitching a small tent I acquired from Walmart. At this point, because of the withdrawals, I hadn't had any desire to eat all day, but I was able to eat half a packet of cheese crackers.  Similarly, despite waking up early, and being entirely exhausted, I was only able to get an hour or two of rest. For now, I am just going to keep trying my best to eat some food whenever I can, and enjoying the few hours of sleep I get when I get them. 

And you know what, today, I felt better. I ate more food than I did yesterday, I meditated for half an hour and tried to really focus on how ravaged the weed made my mind. Maybe tomorrow will be worse, but if it is, I'll know there'll be better days after. And regardless, I know that tomorrow will be a day where I'm sober, and it'll be another day of driving on that long sloped road, but this time I will not be heading for the ocean.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5837793}"

Then later his wife offered me an edible (it wasn't in an undermining way, just an option) and I thought about it and said no thanks, because by the time it kicked in we'd be leaving.

I have been smoking about 0.5-1gr of weed per day for 3 years in regular. Before that, I was much more successful both in my social life and in my career. But since I started drinking this regularly, I'm not the person I used to be anymore. I turned into a more depressed, lazier, more careless, and antisocial person. Apart from these, the thing that affected me the most was memory loss. I am having a hard time remembering my memories from 2 years ago. And this is really getting on my nerves. Can someone who does not fully remember what they went through in the past, that is, someone whose past has disappeared, know who they are now? At least I don't know right now. This journey, which I started in a time when I was in a psychological collapse, to throw my problems back and distract my mind, was like the water I drink at every opportunity. I've been trying to quit for a year, but I'm not completely successful. Last year, I stopped drinking for about 1.5 - 2 months. In the first 20 days, I felt the withdrawal effects very heavily (especially not being able to sleep) and I was trying to reduce it by doing yoga and meditation. Later, it helped, but this time I was afraid that my muscles would be damaged by excessive exercise and I had to take a break from it. So I went back to smoking weed again. Now I'm determined to let it go, never to return. It started to hurt me a lot, both psychologically and physically (nausea, itchy, wet eyes). My body can't take it anymore. But the problem is that I live in a place where weed is illegal. So non-prescription medications or supplements, are also not sold here. I don't want to use a prescription medication just to be able to eat or sleep and then get used to it. I really don't know what to do now and I'm so confused. I haven't been smoking for 2 days but I always have smoking on my mind... Since I have ongoing problems in my private life, I want to drink more in order not to think about them. But I'm sure I have to let it go. Besides, I can't get professional support out of fear (because it's illegal). So I can't tell anyone what's inside of me. I'm so full now and finally, I signed up for this site to pour my heart out to you. Sorry for the long text I wrote and my not very good English.

That health truthfully is wealth. I would see healthy people while I was smoking & be so subliminally jealous, but wouldn’t admit it because I had adapted weed as a personality trait essentially. I am 22M (6’1 &  a little underweight) I smoked for 3 years everyday / all day. I understand now, 1 month in. Healthy living is completely the way to go. 

As far as appetite loss goes, I suggest if you’re in the early stages of quitting weed, you change your diet completely (unless you’re already eating healthy). What you eat will definitely effect how you feel. I went from snacking on unhealthy food for most of the day & eating a big dinner (usually fast food) to now eating 2 big meals (home cooked) & constantly snacking on fruits, veggies & nuts. 

As far as insomnia goes, I would take a hot bath an hour before bed, have the setting dark & light a candle, play slow music & close your eyes (meditation basically). It would relax me & I would sweat buckets. When I got out I would read for ~30 minutes & sleeping wasn’t an issue in no time 🙂

As far as mood changes / swings go, I would let important people around you know what you’re going through & trying to accomplish. If they’re not understanding, cut them off at least for the time being. Positive people in your life, people that really care about you will understand & be supportive. If you explain to them the side effects of what you’re going through, they’ll at least know you’re not just being a douche. Support systems are a very good thing to have, those first couple weeks are horrible. This sub can really help, if you have no one in person.

As far as exercise goes, I started out pacing around my house (I was mess), I eventually started running 2 laps at a nearby school, I am now running 6+ laps every single day. Exercise really is a key factor in your mental / physical health. It will help you sleep at night too, which is a bonus. 

As far as anxiety goes, I was an anxious mess for the 3 years that I was smoking. I would use that to justify my over the top weed habit. Jokes on me, weed was causing the anxiety (fuck me, right?). That first week my anxiety was at an all time high, now 1 month in it’s essentially nonexistent. Time is the key for this one, you’re just gonna have to fight through it & doing breathing exercises.

I think or weed as toxic ex girlfriend now, why would I miss her if all she did was slowly take me away from my full potential? I think that’s why my cravings have been minimal. I can’t speak on cravings because I really haven’t experienced them (I’ve seen some people get them really bad on this sub)

I am hoping all of you have a speedy recovery & If you have any questions, I’ll answer EVERY reply 🙂 Helping people through there journey (even if it’s just a little bit) has helped me through mine so far. Good luck ⭐️",75,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4627751}"

2021-07-13 17:54:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ojpyqz/my_experience_copied_from_one_of_my_comments/,My experience (Copied from one of my comments),"I'm an 18 year old who started drinking with their friends at early 16, gatherings slowly stopped being Gaming LANS, hanging out at houses, chilling in the day time.

Everything became parties with alcohol being brought out every time. It later became a mix of parties, clubbing, going to mates houses, all with weed and alcohol ever-present. 

I became very addicted to the idea of weed. As much as I was a binge-gamer as a child, I had weed to keep me entertained and was a thing I used to socialize. 

I developed a strange, manipulative sort of empathy. Anyone else relate?
I felt like I could change the way I acted very easily, almost mirroring what the person I was speaking to wanted to hear. 
Whether or not I was successful or even remotely correct in my belief doesn't matter, I felt I could change the way someone felt or acted with my own 'social techniques' in a way. 

Anyway I feel I battled the weed down after a couple times where I smoked for weeks/months straight.
I had many many 'last smokes' until I buckled with friends. Noone reading this should feel ashamed doing the same, you'll do it less and less with time and effort. 

I feel I slightly turned back to alcohol but even that I reject now, though I still end up drinking. 
I reject the idea of all substance, as a South African almost every adult male I know drinks.
I've seen addiction first hand, within me and others. 
My friends talk about wanting to try other drugs. It repulses me more and more from them. 
I can't stand my friends being these stoners who say and do the same things that I once did and other stoners I've met have done. There's nothing bad about it truly, but I reject the culture now and I feel torn apart to still be connected through these people. 

At least you can't normally drink alcohol every day but weed it's every afternoon. I saw addiction in myself, it held me back in my academics and now that I'm studying my dream subject, mathematics, after battling quitting weed and getting accepted into uni. 
I don't want to throw my mind away when I'd like to see where it can take me.


After gaining a huge interest in rock climbing, gymming, fungi (Ironically after researching how to grow another mushy drug), family and nature (Also a liking I developed with weed). 
I don't want to be around substance anymore, there's way more to this world for me than weed and other drugs. 
There's family, culture, knowledge, sports, music and much more. Everything I wouldn't have a quarter of the time showing interest in, if I still smoked weed.

It feels like all my friends drink and smoke weed, I feel the pressure (external, mostly internal) to drink, similar to what I felt with weed. Why couldn't I have a nice barbecue? Can I chat and feel a nice warm day?
I know I have addiction problem though I've haven't had nearly the same experience as most people on this subreddit. 

I know this post isn't entirely about weed, but my battle was with weed, I don't think I emphasized it enough but it affected me terribly.
I don't want to have the same problem with alcohol.

I wanted to share my story in case there are any people out there who are just beginning their journey to quit and need someone to relate to.

To begin with, I've been smoking weed nonstop for about 5 years now. Once the pandemic began and I started working from home and I went from smoking when I got out of work till bedtime to being high all day, everyday. My motivation, creativity and joy flew out the window. I felt like a zombie. Nothing would make me happy anymore. I stopped getting excited about the things I'd usually feel passionate about like writing or drawing or watching one of my favorite shows. Everything became a huge pain in the ass. I was eating poorly because all I wanted to do was order food. My apartment was a mess... it was a disaster. 

Eventually the zombie feeling gave way to anxiety, constant air hunger (when you feel like you can't take deep breaths), wicked insomnia and depression. At first I thought something else was wrong. Maybe the food? Maybe lack of exercise? It's a fact that both poor food choices and lack of exercise can damage your body but not once did I ever want to admit that it was the weed and that I had a problem. I mean, it's just weed! Right? But no, as the THC content and its accessibility increases the more life changing it becomes. 

Here I am, years later trying to quit and I'm struggling through some intense withdrawal. I'm not actually craving weed which is a miracle but my anxiety is a nightmare. The insomnia is torturous. I'm easily frustrated and it's hard to be positive. But honestly, I know this is the best decision I've made in a long time. I know for a fact that I'll be in a better place 6 months from now. I feel hopeful and strong even though most nights I'm crying because sleep is so fucking hard these days. Even with the challenges I'm going to keep pushing forward and I hope the rest of you do the same. Don't give up just because it's challenging. One day, you'll look back at this difficult time and be grateful that you didn't give up. Hang in there! I wish you all the best of luck and thanks for reading!",6,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.52371126}"

I have searched the internet for others who have had the same experience, but I haven't found much about it. Here was my experience with, what I consider to be ""short-term autophobia"" from week 1 to about week 5:

First of all, I quit smoking weed after a traumatic event that spiraled me into a massive panic attack that nearly sent me to the hospital. I have dealt with depression since the death of my mother and a little anxiety on top of that, but, I have never experienced the range of emotions I have experienced during that specific event, nor the weeks that followed. While this is just my story, I am curious to know if anyone else had a similar experience.

Up until the point that I quit, I would smoke a bowl every 2-3 hours all day to stave off the boredom of lockdown. I was smoking constantly for about a year and a half. I had smoked before that, but usually only at night or with friends; very casually and in small doses. I went from buy $200 every few months to $500 every month. I was smoking several ounces a month. I had also started to lie about when I was smoking and to worry about what would happen if I couldn't get more weed. For some reason, this just made me want to smoke more. I was stuck in a feedback loop.

After ""the event"", I dumped my stash and threw away all my tools. I was terrified of the stuff. What I had considered my best friend had turned on me and now offered me no relief whatsoever. And that's when shit got real weird.

Week 1

My brain was in absolute overdrive for most of these days. I would wake up anxious and spend the entire day terrified to be in my apartment. Literally. I spent nearly every hour in my aunt's apartment (she lives upstairs) so that I didn't have to be anywhere near my place. That alone was scary. My mind was telling me, ""Bad things will happen if you go down there. You'll get lost in your mind and never come out."" Luckily, my aunt is an absolute star and she let me just chill on her couch and watch M\*A\*S\*H episodes all day. I was sweaty, fatigued, anxious, sad and had zero appetite. I ate one meal a day, which my aunt had to, basically, force me to eat. I would doze off and wake, terrified of everything. Looking back, I can see that this was some kind of **autophobia**. I had suddenly developed an extreme fear about the place I called home.

*Week 2*

Things didn't improve much for me here. I still felt anxious and terrified almost all day. I continued to not be able to eat much and guzzled coffee to try and fight the extreme fatigue I felt all the time. It was as if my eyes decided to go on strike. I was petrified to leave my aunt's house to go ANYWHERE because I thought my eyes would close while I was driving and I would crash. I still couldn't be in my apartment for longer than a few minutes until bedtime. Then, as if by magic, the anxiety lifted and I felt like myself again for a few hours each night. I slept like a baby, but would still wake up to choking anxiety.

*Week 3*

More of the same, but I was able to function a little better. The sweats, shakes and fatigue eased up. I could now spend a little more time every day in my apartment and was able to manage the anxiety and worry well enough. I still experienced intrusive thoughts; I would think about death and dying a lot. But, when I was down in my apartment, I was absolutely manic. I rearranged furniture, cleaned my bathroom, cleaned EVERYTHING and then went back up to be with my aunt again. I was unable to relax at all. I gave up coffee and switched to green tea at a Redditer's suggestion. The headaches sucked but I was willing to deal with a headache over crippling anxiety.

*Week 4*

Finally, after weeks of debilitating anxiety and worry, I began to feel a little better. I was able to spend several hours alone in my apartment and watch TV on the couch. I had moved my computer into the living room so that I could sort of ""nest"" in one room of my apartment. This felt better for some reason. I didn't question it. It all still felt uncomfortable, like I was living ontop of a painful memory, but spending time online distracting myself helped a great deal. 

*Week 5*

Sleep has gotten crappy over the last few days. I don't sleep much more than 5 hours at a time and if I try to stay in bed I end up just flopping around like an uncomfortable fish. The depression has set in in the morning instead of the anxiety and I often find myself sobbing for no reason over, really, nothing at all. Again, I know this is all due to the chemical imbalance in my brain, so I try to allow myself the time to cry, but ultimately, I push on with my day. It's still one of the hardest things I've had to do. I've incorporated 15-20 minutes of rigorous cardio into my morning routine, green tea and positive affirmations during breakfast. I spend quite a bit of time here on Reddit and in the Discord to help keep me on track. I have a therapist who has been somewhat supportive, even if he doesn't truly understand what I am going through.

I have thought about smoking again, if only to make the painful side effects stop, but I haven't. I often tell myself: ""You only have to do this ONCE and then it will be better."" Some days that thought helps and some days it doesn't matter. I try not to expect too much of myself, but I often beat myself up for not feeling ""cheery"" enough or for crying for no good reason. I have forgotten what it was like to feel intense emotions--its been over 6 years since my mother passed away--so when they come (and boy do they come) I am often caught off guard and scared.

I wanted to share this (very long post) with anyone who is curious or may have had the same experiences. I don't know if autophobia is a common side effect of marijuana withdrawals, but what about any of this is really ""common""? After all, we are all pioneers in this department since no studies have been done to provide us with recovery timelines or assistance other than ""just get through it"".

I am still struggling as I head into week 6, but I am doing my best to just let the days unfold as they do. The only expectations I have are: go to work, eat at least twice a day and don't worry about the rest.",15,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6754876}"

I picked up my first joint around 13 years old and other than vacations (in other countries), toked up every single day. Couldn’t miss one, 100% dependant. 

Present day: 11 days no weed. Feeling better than ever and consciously never looking back. 

What helped me the most: Running. Without running, there’s no way I would be where I am today. It reduced triggers that would constantly have me coming back.

2 Main Benefits Why Running Helped My Problem: 

1. When you run, your brain naturally releases more endocannabinoids. 

Endocannabinoids (class of brain chemicals) are similar to what my brain relied on. I was going through heavy withdrawal, and this minimized the withdrawal symptoms and cravings for weed. The issue that always kept me coming back. 

2. Being tired enough to fall asleep. 

Another reason why I would cave into the pointless habit was due to the ‘monkey mind’. My brain uncontrollably thinking in a circle. Having my eyes wide open, I thought I would be up all night. Ruining my next day and sleep cycle. 

As exercise has the same effect and produces the same solution, I chose running because all you need is a pair of shoes. Almost everybody can run (or exercise). 

I could go on and really get in depth, but I’m trying to keep it simple. I really hope this helps somebody like it helped me, even if it’s just one of you beautiful souls.

By chance I came in at the same time as someone who I had been in a band for a little while years ago. I'd been wanting to speak with him about band stuff for a while, because I had seen him a couple of times before, but we didn't have a chance to talk or it was a bit awkward situation for me and I might've been high or something. I had sworn that next time I get the chance to talk with him, I will do it, because I felt like I missed a few opportunities before.

This time I wasn't high and, I waited outside for him, when I saw him come to the cashier behind me.

And he recognized me, it all went good (I have a bit of social anxiety around not well-known people) and I got his number and we can start to maybe make something happen or just meet as friends, who knows.

Now, the fact that I mustered up courage and was sober to properly communicate without being too awkward or out of it, felt so good. I was basically fist bumping the air that this happened, idk why, but I feel genuinely good about it. I did what I promised myself to do, and opened up the potential for other experiences to happen.

Started smoking in 1973 at the age of 17. Mexican brown weed with stems and seeds was common until the early eighties.Then sensi bud took over. I would smoke about a gram a day through my bong. Although I got high I lived responsibly was always employed. I made it a point not to indulge while at work. I must say those were great times growing up during the seventies and eighties. We partied hard and attended many great rock concerts. As time moved on life became more serious and I matured. Eventually weed became legalized for medicinal purposes (1996) here in Southern California and a whole new era was created. The stigma was still there but the cops weren't the constant threat anymore.. I had a good relationship with weed and beer (my go to buzz each afternoon- evening. Many years passed and my health started to decline. The strains became so strong that I could no longer enjoy smoking weed because it was starting to make me paranoid. Anxiety would take the pleasure and heart palpitations and chest pain were happening. So I made the wise choice to hang it up.... Not the first time I've quit but I only lasted 3 years last attempt. So here I am now at day number 420 and I don't have any desire to indulge as I think its finally ran its course. Went through all the withdrawal and still have some PAWS to deal with. But all in all I know I'm in a much better place now......,594,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5561232}"

I wasn't able to understand that my problems in life weren't getting any better but rather I just cared less and less and never did shit about them. I thought this was relieving my anxiety but it actually just made my problems worse by ignoring them. It's pretty hard to articulate I guess but eventually while still smoking I became conscience of this. I would still smoke and everytime felt guilty I was doing this to myself. 
Then the thought that made me quit came to my head:

Why would I keep myself in this cycle of wanting to smoke constantly and then when I do smoke I feel shitty? 


That thought keeps me going. Being sober for 8 days now I'm starting to see things a lot more clearly and my performance in everything I do has drastically improved.",31,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.629368}"

Former pothead here. Smoked daily from 15 to 25, the most crucial years of development for your brain. Litteraly physiologically build my identity around smoking. Trust me, I was a big addict. Smoked like hell, forgot to eat, forgot to do basic things. Failed my studies, failed my romantic relationships, failed my parents. All I was thinking was : 1. smoking and 2. how to quit smoking.

I quit 2 years and 3 months ago, never touched it again.

If you’re in the process of quitting, you’re probably suffering. You have strong craving, you can’t sleep, you feel foggy, bored and/or depressed. Moods swings happens too.

And you’re thinking all that would stop if I only smoke one joint, it’s so tempting. I can quit later, be more prepared etc..  Oh sure this one joint will make you feel good. After all your body is craving it. You’ll sleep like a baby, and you’ll enjoy watching your favorite tv show again.

All are excuses made from your brain, which is suffering because it doesn’t get his daily dose of dopamine. That’s it.  **The pain you feel when quitting WILL STOP.** No matter how addicted you are. The urges will stop. It’s a matter of time.

What will not stop however is the pain of being a pothead if you keep smoking.   Pain is unavoidable, but one is temporary. The other will last as long as you keep smoking.   I never feel any urges anymore. Even when friends smoke around me. I’m totally free from this addiction. Will I smoke again ? No, because I know myself and I could fall back easily. But you know what’s great ? It’s not even a tiny bit painful to tell myself I’m never gonna smoke anymore. I just don’t need it anymore.

Here is a roadmap of the process of quitting. It may slightly differ depending on everyone.

&#x200B;

* **-first few weeks :** strong cravings, struggle to sleep, foggy brain. We all know this phase.

My advice : be gentle with yourself. Play video games, go for porn, everything else you want. Try to minimise the willpower you need to quit. Keep yourself busy, you don't have yet to do something productive, just keep yourself busy with whatever. Avoid replacement with alcohol or other drugs though.

&#x200B;

* **-2-3 months :** well done. Strongs cravings are gone, you sleep normally finally. But this phase is tricky, and probably the most important one. You **NEED**, and this is not negociable, to change your habits. Or else you will fail, without a doubt. Your addiction is fuelled by underlying issues you might have like emotional trauma, anxiety, depression, self-esteem issues, etc. **That is the fuel of every addiction. Emotionnal pain**. This pain will make you come back to drugs.

My error : at this stage I basically replaced weed with a ever progressive alcohol consumption. Don't do that.  I struggled to quit that as well.

My advice : understand that you need to learn how to manage emotionnal pain in a healthy way. Meaning not with any kind of drugs. **This is the big deal**. This is what can really free you. Seek a therapist, it's worth it. Write your thoughts, meditate, exercice. Basic advices but actually DO IT. It will help tremendously.

&#x200B;

* **6 months and more :** very well done, the hardest is behind you. At this stage, if you applied my advices, you will have not fallen back. Now, smoking is still in your mind, you still have some vague cravings and ''what if'' moments. Still don't do it. You'd fall back quickly. You don't erase years or decade of addiction in 6 months. Beware of this, because as you feel much better you might think you can smoke again and you''l be fine. It's a big NO. It's not worth it at all, you only playing with your willpower and it will be harder to sober up again after a few joints.

My advice : you need to understand that by quitting smoking you chose to face reality. And reality can be painful. You will feel shit at times, really shitty. And you don't have weed to numb this feeling anymore. Hence why you need to work on your emotionnal resillience, a skill that every addict lack. Meditation and exercice.

Meditation teaches you how to not transform the pain in suffering. Pain is physical, suffering is made up in our minds. This one is avoidable. You can start with meditations apps like Headspace. For more advanced I recommend books like The Mind Illuminated by Cudalasa.

Exercice release feel-good hormones in your body, teach you discipline and resilience, and make you look good and have a better health. Also depending on the sport you practice you can make friends and have a new fun hobby. all good.

&#x200B;

* **1 year :** and WHAT NOW ?

Now cravings are gone, you freed yourself from your addiction. You don't need it anymore. But you still feel empty, inside ? Yeah guess what, life is not all beautiful. You can't create superficial feel good emotions with drugs anymore. So you sometimes suffer, like all human beings. Sometimes you feel joy as well. Not fake joy or superficial joy, real joy. And this is beautiful.

As I said, you might have underlying mental issues you were numbing with weed. You need to treat them because they won't go away just because you quit smoking. You need to understand that quitting weed is ONLY THE START, but it is the first most important step.

What if you don't have any issues at all underlying ? I don't believe it, neither you do. Addiction comes from a need to espace reality, and to numb pain. It's as simple as that. Why would you be addicted otherwise ? Be honest with yourself.

&#x200B;

Now you can do whatever you want. You know you have the willpower to stop a decade long addiction, so you can do much more. What about these projects you keep under the carpet while you were smoking ? It's time.

&#x200B;

*Here the most importants points you need to remember :*

&#x200B;

* Pain is temporary. Always.
* Addiction is a symptom, not a cause. You need to treat the cause in order to heal.
* You will not feel good forever just because you quit. Life is a rollercoaster. Good moments, bad moments. Accept it.
* Quitting weed is only the beginning
* You can do it. If I can, you can.

&#x200B;

It baffles me how often I've bought a large bag (usually only bought ounces) and after a few joints I'm like ugh why did I buy this, I don't even want it. I kept smoking consistently until last week, when I finally decided it was time again to quit for good. Of course, a few days later I get actual COVID symptoms and now I have to isolate again. My addict brain tried to convince me that I ""deserve"" to feel ""better"", and that smoking will do that. The reality is that I've smoked through every sickness I've ever had, and it probably made the healing process that much harder. Now I'm using this as an opportunity to easily not smoke, since I'm just going to feel like shit either way.

this is just a kind of desperate try to offload some bad craving thoughts. I stopped smoking in November 2019 because I had to. I admitted myself to psychiatry after I had a catastrophic year, where I lost my apartment, my job, basically my whole goddamn life (with lots of liabilities/debts created). Since then I have been trying to get my shit together and didn't do too bad. I went for a treatment of my addicitions (Amphetamines and Weed) for about 6 months. I'm currently living with a few other clean addicts in an assisted-living kind of thing and I've been earning money in a new job since February. My debts have been reduced from about 10.000 € to about 500 €. So far, so good.

I was still smoking cigarettes until about 1.5 years ago, when I switched to vaping e-liquids with nicotine. Now today is my seventh day without vaping. I need to cut down on nicotine heavily since my pancreas is also infected (pancreatitis). I have to admit the last days my craving for cannabis has been intense as never before in those 2.5 years. Nicotine-withdrawal is fucking with my mind. Although I 'm administering nictoine via chewing gums and band-aids, so it's ""only"" the whole act of handling a vaping device, inhaling, etc.

I feel like I have had it with this whole clean lifestyle, it just never seems to get any easier since I stopped. Now I'm attacking my last addiction (nicotine) and it feels like I'm starting all over again and if the last 2.5 years didn't even happen.

Until I stopped vaping e-liquid I felt like I was in ok-shape addicition-wise, but now it's scaring the hell out of me. Day after day more and more thoughts emerge such as: When will I feel better? Is it ever over? Will I ever be happy without weed or will i feel fulfilled? Why am I doing this to myself (causing constant pain (this is what it feels like right now) by beeing sober when I would feel better if I smoked weed (which I can't really know I would do after beeing sober for 2.5 years).

In therapy everybody always says: addiction is an illness and relapse is one of the symptoms of this illnes (meaning it is normal that it happens).

I have never had a single relapse after beeing sober since November 2019. I'm starting to think if it is maybe overdue for me to have a relapse (and then I ask myself is it me or the addicition speaking. LUL and cry).

Right now it just feels like I'm not cut out for living a permanent sober life. It feels like a constant battle  which I can hardly ever win.

I'm aware I'm dramatizing to a degree; I'm just hoping for input of any kind and wanted to get this off my chest. Thank you for your understanding and your patience.",2,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5813782}"

I see posts about people at 90 days, 100 days--a year and I just start sobbing because I think, ""I will never make it that far.""

My father told me, my whole life, that my achievements were ""nice"" but he never told me I was good just as I was. In the same way, the man I loved always told me ""that's great, but I know you can do better"" about anything and everything I did. My mother was the one who supported me and accepted me as I was--all of me. But, she passed away in 2014. I feel like that solid support was taken out from underneath me and I reached for anything I could to fill that void. I reached for cigarettes, for food, for alcohol and then for weed. 

I have accomplished so much in my lifetime through hard work and dedication, but I have never looked at myself in the mirror and said, ""You have done enough for now. You are good just as you are."" It feels so alien to me to do that. It feels like I am settling or that I am giving up.

People would tell me I was a better person on Weed, socially.

I told myself I would not even think about smoking until I was done coughing up stuff -- still am -- lungs are fine but it is more psychological how I wish to ""elevate"" again.

Advice?

Another thing... I was at such a creative peak... I would make multiple beats and freestyles EVERY DAY for OVER 2 YEARS... now it is like once every few weeks... maybe if that... Everything felt so RIGHT before!!  I know I am ""better"" but I wonder how long before I am ""myself"" again?",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4295933}"

Yesterday I talked with my sister and she's taking care of everything by herself in Venezuela. She's having anxiety attacks and panic attacks due to all this situation. I understand her of course, I lived with that almost all my life.

I tried once at 15 and then at 17 it became a habit since then. I think I stopped 3 times, no more than 2 months each time and I always find my way to relapse. I'm 33.

I just want to get better and I really feel weed it's holding me back to improve my mental health and deal with all this with a clear mind.

Zero motivation.,"Hey all, just recently I’ve accepted that my smoking habit is not ideal. I could use some advice on finding motivation to make changes. 

During quarantine weed became my coping mechanism to kill time, now we’re 8 months of daily smoking later. 

I’m a student, so I’ve been shut in my 12sqm studio for months, with university campus closed and working online. I feel exhausted all the time, am constantly lying down, and completely demotivated to do anything (yes its impacted my work). 

I’ve always had an addictive personality, I also smoke cigs and drunk alcohol before I started smoking weed.  Depression and anxiety are further influences and while Ive been in therapy for months i am still scared to reveal how often I’ve been smoking.

Still what’s stopping me from quitting (or how it feels) is that time moves too slow when i don’t smoke. It’s 10:30am here now, and the thought of spending another full day alone inside with my thoughts is the worst. 

I’ve never reacted well to advice as: go for a walk, or practice mindfulness. It feels arbitrary and just as a reminder that I cant find the motivation within myself.

I’ve been a heavy consumer (~2 grams a day) for about 4 years now and it’s gone from a helpful tool to a massive liability. Like many here, I seem to have an inability to consume in moderation. 

I decided to start growing earlier this year. I managed to get 2 plants to completion and hung them to dry. My AC went out the day after they were cut down and the humidity went over 70%. Long story short, I had to throw my plants in the garbage after some mold inevitably developed. I was so disgusted and angry. I broke down and sobbed openly after all the TLC I put into my plants. Then something truly amazing happened: I didn’t want to smoke anymore. I was planning to have my own homegrown bud for a while and the loss of my crop totally killed my desire to consume. 

I would never have imagined that I’d see this as a blessing, but here we are. It was a project that motivated me, growing cannabis. Then it became the tool I needed to quit. Sometimes in life, you fall flat. It’s often in those moments where you learn the most about yourself. I’m so grateful for the lost crop now. I’m also incredibly grateful to all of the users in this sub. Your stories have motivated and inspired me.

I’ve been smoking for a few years but prided myself on the fact that I smoked small amounts and maintained a pretty active schedule, working full time and running a small business, exercising and being a newly married man.

I have family involved in cultivation so large amounts of green lying around for free became normal which is where I seem to have lost the idea of doseage and spending money on it. Getting it for free has created the monster. 

My first attempt lasted about 12 hours. My second about 4 days. I realised that I use cannabis to reward myself for working hard (or at least I perceive myself too) and quitting feels very difficult.

Watching podcasts where everyone is completely baked talking about interesting things gave me a false sense of security that it’s fine to smoke a lot and as long as your functional who really cares. Some of these guys are millionaires and highly successful, it must be ok right?

The real kick in the balls came when I lied to my wife, trying to get a blast when she goes out etc. Really shitty behaviour that I’m not proud of.

I have not experienced any physical withdrawal outside of some irritability and cravings. No sweats, disturbed sleep etc. But giving up is hard and I find myself waking up craving wake n bake and I’m worried where this will end.

I do genuinely believe I can have a relationship with cannabis that is not abusive but 30 days off just seems to be the right calling for me now.

I had just been laid off and my girlfriend of 6 years left. The biggest reason was I a useless shell of my former self that got high, smoked, ate food, watched some porn, and went to bed.

Today I am optimistic, sober, motivated, positive, gainfully employed (six figures), dating seriously, independent, not anxious, and my health has improved 100x.

Of course this is a factor of many things, many lessons, support from friends and strangers. But if I had to pick the #1 foundational choice I made it was giving up weed. No matter how difficult. And boy was it difficult.

I had experimented with sobriety before. Always felt great. Always slipped back. I've now been more or less weed-sober for 2 years (2 short relapses a year ago, but nipped them in the butt). I drink occasionally, but I get really nasty hangovers and don't enjoy it much so it's never been something I abuse.

**My timeline:**

* The first 2 weeks are the worst by far. I had full blown withdraw. The shakes, zero appetite, insomnia, panic attacks. I had to call my mom just to ask her to make sure I ate 2 meals a day. She would sit on the phone with me while I made a Peanut Butter sandwich.
* The next 1-4 months are hard, but progressively easier. But will come in waves.
* After this I felt much better. My anxiety dissipated.
* This was also when I started feeling like I could get away with a smoke now and then. I was wrong. Immediately back on a 2-week long binge with a mild hangover. I flaked on friends, was a shell for others. Then pandemic hit. One of the biggest regrets of my life was being a stoned POS that month.
* Sober again. This time I finished out the year and a little more.
* Feeling 100% better about my life and body.
* Studied, got a new job, made a bunch of friends, am more optimistic about life than I ever have been.

**A few lessons and advice:**

* Do whatever it takes. Let yourself play videogames all day. Eat some junk food. Go for walks. Delete the phone numbers of any plugs.
* Sleep might be really rough for a few weeks. Everyone is different and it happened in waves for me.
   * I had hot flashes, difficulty falling asleep, brain fog. I don't remember when it stopped
   * Setting a bedtime, no screens, and reading or journalling in this time helped me. 
* Anxiety might get worse before it gets better. 
   * I had the worst anxiety of my life the month I quit. Panic attacks and all. Then I had moderate anxiety for 6 months. Now I literally never feel anxious, even under stress. 
   * The weed I was using to ""treat"" my anxiety was likely what actually caused it.
* Tell your family. I don't know your situation, but chances are they will be much more supportive and nonjudgemental then you are thinking.
   * Many adults (your parents, aunts, and uncles) have seen people go down bad paths and some recover. It happens to the best of people. They know it's hard and will have empathy.
   * They will respect you for identifying this on your own and being brave enough to ask for help.
   * No one will shame you for trying to get sober. They won't even shame you for making mistakes and slipping up.
   * They probably wouldn't even shame you for lying and coming clean. But they will if they find you sneaking around. Just be honest.
* It can be done alone. But it's so much easier with support.
* Delete the number of any plugs. Tell your friends you are going to quit.
* Don't hang out with people who are smoking. You can hang out with them other times. But never when weed is around.
* **Never sleep in a house that has a stash.** (This was the single most important factor for me). Get rid of yours, don't stay with friends that have. Even if you resist, your brain doesn't need the overhead.
* Use the I Am Sober app. Checkin Daily.
* Giving up things can feel hard. Set milestones for yourself to get past the worst part. Plan to reach at least a year and then break that down to monthly milestones. (esp 1mo, 2mo, 3mo, 6mo).
   * Know the dates and celebrate those wins.
   * Using a streak track was a big motivator for me.
* Avoid weed completely for this 1 year period. If your with friends and it comes out, try to leave. Or go for a walk. Or take a call.
   * After a year, use your judgement if you can just stay and say ""no thank you"" but it's usually easier to just leave.
* Find the things weed is helping you avoiding dealing with, and go deal with them.
   * I prioritized going to the doctor (I had undiagnosed IBS-C which I was self medicating with weed for 2 years). Once that was resolved, my need for weed was much less.
* I talked on the phone with friends. A lot. When you have no job and need to distract yourself, find people you can talk to. Whether about sobriety or just anything.
* Other hobbies I used: DJing, Oil Pastels while listening to music, walks, writing. I kept my TV pg, chill. Nothing sexually charged or super dark.
* It helped me to give up drinking for several months as well. Mostly because drinking lowered my willpower and made me more likely to smoke. Hangovers were also a trigger.
   * I'm not saying you need to stop drinking, but it helped me a lot to just do 100 days pure sober.
* Use this sub reddit. Support one another. There were a few people here who had a tremendous impact on my success. Just find someone at a similar stage or one stage ahead of you. I am happy chat.
* In the beginning - focus on yourself. If you can find someone to buddy with, great. But if their messages are spiraling and triggering you, encourage them to write a public post and explain you just need some space. **In the first few months, your top responsibility is to get sober.** If that means you can't be someone's support, OK. In the later months, try to help others. We all have our time and our place. You can help others better when you're sober.
* If you need to leave this sub for awhile (you're doing good, but the posts are triggering), then leave for a bit. Come back when you're sober if you can to write a post like this. But take care of yourself.
* Set goals other than sobriety that will be aided by sobriety.
   * For me I decided I wanted to become a software engineer. It took a lot of studying and hard work. I couldn't afford to smoke and hit my goals. That made it easier.

I was really addicted at the end. Blowing through a Q a week (I'm a lightweight too\_, wake-n-bake, vape carts lasted 2-3 days. Hit a joint one day at 10am and felt nothing.

Keep on keeping on. You've got this fam. You're on the right path. You can't believe what waits for you a year or two from now in sobriety. Life is so much better with a clear mind and a stable mood.",114,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3794535}"

Last year I kicked both habits, but only quitting cigarettes was successful, within a week or two I found myself smoking joints in the weekend. Once the pandemic started I was back to smoking daily. Not in large quantities and only after the working day. But still too much in my opinion.

Ofcourse my addicted brain said it didn't count as smoking. The strange thing is, I've gotten so used to not smoking cigarettes, that 'regular' smoking is completely out of my system. The obvious benefit is that I smoke less in total, but whenever I smoke, it's a joint. Because I don't want to be stoned anymore, I hugely reduced the amount of stuff I put in it. But I still smoke hash, and once I smoked the first joint, I'm always thinking about the next one.

And the ritual is still there. Fabricating a joint, have a few puffs, the illusion of satisfaction, and keep myself occupied with low effort activities while thinking how late I will light up my next one.

Most of the time I feel guilty and try to analyze where it goes wrong. And I found that I would prefer 4 light joints to only one that knocks you out. So it appears to me that the act of smoking is more tempting than getting really stoned. So in my opinion, my addiction to nicotin makes it a lot harder for me to quit. And because I refuse to start smoking cigarettes again, I keep myself in the cycle.

I know it eventually comes down to 'just do it'. And to be honest, the cravings aren't even that strong. But I keep on finding myself giving in the very first day, it almost seems like a compulsion.

I woke up feeling alright, but as the morning wore on, I began to feel the crushing weight of depression come on. Generally, nothing is wrong--I'm having a pretty boring day overall (I used to just LOVE boring ass days). But, for some reason, the tears are in full swing this afternoon. I've noticed that if I ""cry it out"" I often feel better but, it's not always a good time to just start sobbing.

While the anxiety has lessened over the last few days, it seems to be replaced with some pretty powerful mood swings. I get to feeling like I don't have a purpose in life and like I have lost my ability to create or enjoy things. My mind tries to tell me that my life is meaningless; like I am just killing time until my demise. On the other side of the coin, I have begun enjoying things again (like going hiking and working out in the garden). However, it seems that the depressive swings override the happy swings and I forget that its not all or nothing.

I realize that this is all garbage thinking and that, somewhere, there is something for me to do that has meaning. But, pushing through these feelings when I used to just light up a bowl is incredibly difficult. I miss being able to make these feelings go away in an instant.

Bored? Smoke a bowl.

Happy? Sure, smoke a bowl!

I quit once in 2016 for a year it was very hard and I had uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms... loss of appetite with weight loss, heavy sweating, insomnia and nightmares but I got through it and did not smoke for a year. However in the middle of 2017 I started smoking again and I think it was because I was in a toxic relationship. I ended the relationship in 2019 and even moved to a new city but still continued to smoke. The pandemic made my habit worse then it has ever been in my life. I was laid off and worried like so many others about the future and staying safe but with all the time spent at home in lockdowns and the added stress I found myself smoking all day.  Now I find pot is making my anxiety worse and I no longer want anything to do with it.

So I noticed, like many others, that weed makes me feel stagnant in life, as Others have often said, it makes me okay with being bored.
That leads to me not growing as a person, as I don't do anything even remotely challenging. 
I've always struggled with studying while high, I can't get anything to stick, it's harder to make connections and concentrating for even half an hour is pure dread. 

So I realized that I smoked a substance on a daily basis, that a) stole all my motivation to even study or learn anything new in the first place and b) made it impossible for me to learn new things if I could muster a little interest and willpower to educate myself. 

Weed doesn't make me stupid (though the brain fog and inability to concentrate can make me feel that way), it just makes me so complacent that I barely add to my knowledge or skills.
If that happens for years on end, of course I'll have nothing to show for myself.

I've been an off-and-on smoker since 2015 and, when COVID started, retreated to my drug of choice and went downhill.  I had tried and failed over and over and over to quit and made it 6 days once. Every other time, I would be back smoking by day 2-3. 

This weekend was the toughest battle for me as it would be when I would smoke the most.  On Friday, I went to get my nails done and came face to face with my biggest challenge yet: avoiding the legal weed shop (I'm located in Canada). My previous habit would be to get weed on my way home from getting my nails done as it was on the way.  I managed to walk by it and didn't stop!! It's a big fucking win for me.

The insomnia started this weekend and today I feel irritable as fuck.  I hate everyone and everything and just want to yell at everyone. I know this is normal and I'm keeping away from most people so I don't lash out at them accidentally.

I want to try to keep my story short. I was smoking for 5 years now, almost daily with little pauses or vacation inbetween. 
Last year I started self-analyzing myself very offen while being high. I googled very much about how to become more self-conscious, how to be more succesful in life etc. I looked for too much things and the things i read overwhelmed me. I read more and more things I couldn’t Relate to. I was so scared. This turned into some kind of anxiety over time. I kept smoking and giving in to the anxious thoughts. 
I read about People founding their own business, learning coding in their free time and thought: „Why am I Not like this? Why am I just watching Netflix and playing video Games while some People at my age have their own companies etc.?“
Don‘t get me wrong, I wasn‘t sad or anxious because I am not successful, but because I couldn‘t understand how other people think different from me. I started to think that I‘m crazy. That my way of thinking or my thoughts are wrong. The more anxious I got, the more I started overthinking and googling. And the more reasons I found why I am crazy now. I was already feeling anxiety because of that, but ist was manageable until then.

I really hoped that weed was the reason why I felt like this. So I stopped smoking in April this year, already anxious and hoping that it will get better. But then, the worst time of my life started. I felt MASSIVE anxiety from day one of quitting. My overthinking about going crazy started to be there from morning to evening. My heart was racing constantly. I couldn’t even think straight. And feeling like this confirmed my thought of becoming crazy or having damaged my brain. But I kept on going, hoping that the anxiety will go away after time. I Managed to quit for 35 days, but I felt not in any way better. The anxiety became so hard that I think I got scared of the fact that I have to live with this anxiety. I am anxious about not becoming normal again. I feel so hopeless.

My theory is that weed and overthinking made me anxious and through quitting it just got way worse. To a point where I am just anxious because I am scared of the anxiety. 
My only hope is that all of this is just because of withdrawal. Could this be possible? If yes: is it possible for anxiety to start getting worse only One day into quitting? And could it still be withdrawal if I don’t really feel better after 35 days?

After relapsing, I am now on day 2 again.

Hello everyone. It’s been 35 days since I last used any cannabis products. And while I thought things would get easier, I’m not gonna lie - this last week has been tough.

While the first few weeks were hell and the mood swings and anxiety were intense, I often had good days mixed in with the bad. One would be awful, while others I felt extremely proud and good about myself. I liked the direction I was headed. But my mood has since leveled off, and now I just feel down.

Sleep seems to be getting worse. My dreams are very vivid. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. They can be quite trippy and fun. But once in a while there are some stressful ones, and I wake up in a cold sweat which makes it hard to go back to sleep. Video games and TV don’t hold my interest like they once did. And I’ve just been in a general low mood for the last bit.

I still run everyday which obviously helps the dopamine get going. I also bought a pull up bar and have been working with that. Having small exercise goals always help. I also have talked to my doctor and a few councillors that deal with mental health and addiction. They’re helpful too. 

I met a girl too, but I don’t know how I feel about her. And I’m scared shitless I might hurt her badly. I feel like I’m leading her on, and I just don’t know where things are going.

Does anyone have some advice, or words of wisdom to keep on going? I really appreciate all the comments and feedback. I don’t think I would’ve gotten this far without this subreddit. You are all very helpful.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38494328}"

Tommorrow marks one week clean and like many I have been experiencing vivid dreams. 

In my dream I was part of a huge team of people who were searching for a missing member of our group, she was feminine and we all feared the worst. No one rested until she was found, when we did find her she had been sexually assaulted.

I woke up and immediately began thinking about my own sexual assault which happened 6 years ago. I was 19 and in my first week of working at a restaurant the boss offered me a staff meal and a drink after work, he kept topping up my wine and then forced himself onto me. 

I have never been able to face this memory since it happened. I never spoke up, I never defended myself. This incident also marked the beggining of daily heavy drug use... first non prescription meds and then weed when I couldnt handle the come downs. I never really considered that I had been using since this happened to me, a past version of myself would have prefered to never remember it again for as long as I lived. 

I keep thinking about all those people in my dream, all those little peices of my subconcious who fought so hard to retreive the girl that we had lost. When we found her, even though she had been hurt, it was such a huge success. 

Today marks 7 days sober and the first day of me speaking up and advocating for myself. I never thought I would be strong enough to do this...

I visit this subreddit daily to stay foccused on my goal to be sober, I thank everyone who has been vulnerable and shared their stories, it has been so encouraging.

It's been happening. I know it has something to do with going through a really stressful past year with my partner. We're doing better now but it's on going, some weeks better than others. And the thing is that the progress we've made is because I've been sober and therefore much more open about my feelings and honesty and not retreating from tough talks. 

However I find myself fantasizing about getting high and just having some ""me time."" I know that's part of what drove the addiction. Anxiety and that feeling that weed just kinda puts you in a fuzzy little bubble and the outside world can't touch you. 

There's also some part of me that neurotically LOVES having a secret. Not fully sure what that's about, I guess probably another ""it's all mine and only mine"" kinda thing. The big step for me getting clean the last time was finally telling my partner of many years that I'd been secretly getting stoned nearly every day for many years. Not when we started dating but I went back on weed about 5 years into our relationship despite bonding over both not being stoners in the beginning. Taking the risk to tell them that i'd been addicted and was taking the steps to really quit was a big moment. 

The recent stuff we've been dealing with also requires being super open and vulnerable and there's this little part of me that's reacting by being like, ""look how good you've been doing with all this honesty! your reward is to make a little secret for just us, just you and me, self.""

I don't know if will work for me but really don't know what else to do. It's an advantage maybe that people here doesn't know who you are at all.

My life has been trapped into a bad period for the last 2 years almost. Yesterday I found out that my father has COVID-19, and he's living in the worst country's of all to deal with that situation: Venezuela. My father has diabetes and a lot of problems related to that. He lost his sight and he got in an out from hospitals regularly for other plenty of issues, and now this.

I've been dealing with depression for a long time, and besides all that, problems also at work. I found out this last week that they will not renew my contract. I was glad, my boss it's a narsisistic crazy man and we all know that he's taking the company literally to the garbage. In a way I'm glad because all the extra stress and worries this job has brought into my life are not worth it and I know that maybe next month he will not have money to pay all of us, not only me. It's a crazy situation, my roommate thinks it's like a latin american novel in my office. Anyway, the good thing is that I have an unemployment payment for at least 6 months, is not much but it's something, and also my mother it's coming to Spain to live finally in August, and I wanted to spend time with her, I haven't seen her in 5 years.

I don't have so much savings because I don't earn so much and also I'm the worst administrating myself but I'm willing to hold myself on spending in stupidity and also: weed. Weed is the only thing that can calm my anxiety (for a while). I really want to quit because I want to be a better version of myself and move on but it's seems to be impossible with all this mess going on in my life. I don't want to go anymore to the psychologist, I feel like I haven't got any better and I'm spending this money for nothing. He just sit there and listen what I say and then answer me with obvious stuff to say. I need someone who can truly help me, giving me some tools I can use when I feel the world it's coming on me like I feel right now.

I never felt like everyone else, I always felt different and really, at my 33 year's old, I find myself in this shitty situation were I feel so lost, so freaking lost and alone. Not knowing what it's going to happen with my future makes me so anxious. No job, no money, no peace of mind and no self-esteem. I just feel my life it's a huge mess right now, more than ever. I left everything in my country to come here with almost nothing, 5 year's ago. I don't know how I was so strong before and I managed to do all that with almost no help and alone. I see me now and I'm full of fear and guilt.

Sometimes I just feel the best it's to not exist anymore but I'm to scared of doing something about it. I hope this period of my life passed quickly and that my father will overcome this. My mother was saying that we must make ourselves, me and my sister, ready for anything, because my father it's very sick and that we must be ready for the worst. How can I?. After this nightmare with my ex and all that shit.

Brand new member of the community.","So late last year I was diagnosed with a heart condition that requires me to take a prescription medication. This medication, especially the one I just changed to, do not interact well with many things, such as caffeine, alcohol, and surprise surprise, marijuana! I've been an off and on to daily smoker for around a decade, with breaks in between. I'd been keeping a healthy relationship with weed for the past year in part to prove to myself that I can do it and to make sure I don't slip into too bad of habits (I had a moderate drinking problem in college. Depression is a bitch). But as of the past couple of weeks I hadn't been enjoying smoking as it made me panicked and anxious about my heart, not to mention the chemical interactions between my medication and weed. I'd been experiencing my heart issue a little more frequently as well.


With all of this happening I've made the decision to at the very least suspend my consumption until I get to a healthier weight (on my way) and feel more comfortable with my medication. In all reality there's a strong chance that it'll be a permanent change. But I'm trying to view it as me taking control of my life instead of being forced down a path. I'm not jazzed about it, but it's definitely a great trade to not experience episodes with my heart. I've got enough to worry about after all lol.


I don't really know the point of this, just wanted to share my personal story. Felt good to get it off my chest. I've really been feeling like my life is getting dramatically changed without my input but I think this is something I can do to make sure I'm doing better

This page helped me a lot in the first few weeks of quitting weed and for that I’m grateful. It was posts like the one I’m about to make that kept me motivated. All I can say is that it gets easier.

I was a heavy bong smoker for 10 years, every single day, morning til night. The only time I didn’t do it was at work.

I just woke up one day and decided today is the day I quit. All of my friends were confused, but I just explained I needed to know what it feels like to be sober, I want to know if I can do it. All of my friends and my fiancé still do it daily, and it doesn’t bother me to be around it. I think the main reason for my success is that I felt ready, no one was forcing me to quit. So I don’t preach to my friends or anyone about it, because when I was an addict I didn’t want to hear about other people quitting. It is something you have to do when you are ready.

I am so happy I found this page. The first 3 - 4 weeks of my journey I spent reading all of these posts, and sweating profusely in the night, crazy dreams, waking up in puddles of my own sweat, having no appetite. After the 3 week mark there was a noticeable difference in all of that. Not sweating at night and waking up to soaked sheets…honestly that was the worst. My appetite is back in full force. I have always been petite (while I was smoking especially) about 108-113 lbs. I am now 138 and I have gotten many compliments that I look happier and healthier. They say I looked good before, but a bit of extra weight looks good on me and I agree, I’ve always been trying to gain weight and I didn’t realize how much weed was impacting that. I’m now 135lbs and I feel great, I actually have boobs and butt now which my fiancé seems to love lol.

Anyways, thanks for listening, thanks for this community. And if anyone out there is struggling and needs to talk, I’m here!

I've had a few urges to use, but none too strong to predominate over my reasons for quitting. As I said last time, almost everything has changed since 2016.

Other areas of notable improvement are executive function, concentration, appetite, wakefulness, and reduced emotionality and anxiety. Meditation has been an interest of mine for years, and now that I'm sober it's possible for me to practice without getting mired in solipsism. I'm not painfully bored. Got a gym membership to get me around new people and a subscription to Netflix so I might be able to relate to them. I'm gonna apply to a bunch of jobs this week that aren't customer-facing, or at least in settings where professional conduct is expected. Then I can focus on building a healthy community and actually doing my own thing, which weed has been standing in for this whole time. After that, I don't know.

For reference I’m 20 and have been smoking pretty heavily ever since covid went into full swing and online classes were a thing. It’s crazy that’s it’s almost been a year since then and I barely remember any of it. Anyways, I’ve been smoking with my 2 best friends from high school who are basically brothers to me. We’ve done everything together, except quit smoking. I’ve wanted to quit since I’ve admitted myself into therapy but I just couldn’t do it. A couple of times Id quit for a week and reward myself with a toke, we all know what happens after a celebratory toke though. Now it’s halfway through July and I’m done. Every time I smoke I just sit there and tell myself how much of a failure I am. I want to go to medical school when I graduate, and I have the resources and means to do, but I can’t go to medical school and continue smoking weed. I get so lazy when I smoke, I just sit there and worry about what I should be doing that I never end up doing anyways so I just get to watch the days go by , weeks, months, and it drives me insane. My house is always a mess, I never eat, I never sleep, I’d even leave family events to go smoke with my friends. To make things worse, I was the best version of myself I’ve ever been last summer, I worked out and put on a lot of muscle, roughly 30lbs which is a lot for me since I was underweight all of my life. I got an amazing girlfriend and I was ready for the school year, then I got sick with covid and lost my sense of taste and smell. Fast forward to now I lost 30 lbs because I stopped eating and replaced it with smoking, I got my gf hooked on weed, I’m the complete opposite of myself one year ago and I’m over it. I’m sorry for making this post so long but it’s certainly overdue. This is my promise to myself, my gf, this awesome community, and most importantly to the future Dr. DietWater. I am done with weed.

Weekend smoker for 6 years, daily smoker for another 4, multiple attempts at quitting.

Today is Day 11; that's 1 day longer than I made it last time! My sleep is still crap. Waking up feeling really tired has become the norm, but today it was accompanied by extreme crankiness.

Yesterday morning was a bright spot though. I woke up feeling normal. I went to the waterfront and enjoyed breakfast like I used to, picked up a few things, got a haircut, and just hung out near the water. It felt great. I felt more connected to reality and better able to enjoy simple, small things than I have for a while. It only lasted a few hours though until the tiredness, headache, and irritability set in again.

When I started this post I ordered delivery. My order arrived but was mostly incorrect (yet again). Oh boy! I haven't been that angry in a long, long time. I had to take it out on my pillow. After going ballistic on my bedding then eating, I seem to have calmed down a bit. A new Harry's Garage video helped (car nuts say hey).

The point to this post? Simply to log my progress, acknowledge my struggles, and maybe help others going through the same things.

Basically, I've hung out with several friends since I quit smoking and got out of the bad part of withdrawals. And I have to say, I thought at the beginning of the summer that maybe post-covid I had developed social anxiety or something. My social battery would drain so fast...   


Nah. Just an addiction. I was getting anxious when the weed would wear off, anxious when I was high... I have had wonderful days with my friends since I quit, making boba tea from scratch, going to the river, and I've honestly never felt happier or more grateful to be sober in the presence of people I love. My ADHD hyperactivity is coming back in full force, but so is my *personality.*   


I'm funnier when I'm sober. I'm a better listener. I'm a quicker thinker, and I honestly have more fun hanging out with people. I can't believe I psyched myself out. Plus, the confidence that comes from saying ""I quit because I was addicted"" -- priceless. My friends were all really genuinely proud of me and some of them said they felt inspired to try cutting back their drinking because of me, which made me feel so loved and happy. Now I feel so free, because I can go anywhere for any amount of time and all I need to feel alright is food and water. I don't have to plan around coming home to smoke or feel guilty for sneaking off to have a hit in the bathroom or anything. I'm so happy I quit. Life is good.

Brief background: I smoked multiple times a day for the past year and was off-and-on for several years before that. I quit two weeks ago because I felt for a while that I wasn't living up to my potential and was using weed to suppress boredom and difficult emotions. Two hours after I quit, my girlfriend and I broke up. I thought it was mutual--she said she needed space to deal with her mother's death and underlying anxiety. I took it okay though I still wanted to smoke to get away from thinking about her, but I resisted.

The first week was hard because of physical urges to smoke. I was tired every day, even after getting a full night's sleep. I drank plenty of coffee, but it didn't do much good. Overall, I felt agitated and found it hard to focus on anything, including my work. The boredom also hit me hard. I got so accustomed to smoking after work--the mere act of lighting up burned time (pun intended), and the rest of the evening seemed to fly by. But since quitting, I've had to find new, healthier ways to pass time. I was working out 2-3 days/week before. Now, it's more like every day. I feel like getting a lift or run in has helped with pent-up aggression, which I was forcing down before by dulling my senses and focusing instead on mindless activities. In general, not smoking has revealed more physical tension, so I'm trying to be more mindful of the need to stretch.

Last Sunday, I learned that my ex was actually cheating on me. I loved her, and the heartache has been brutal. I've wanted so bad just to smoke and run away from this. I haven't though--and won't. I realize that my impulse to smoke is literally evidence that I was abusing weed to avoid confronting difficulties in my life, whatever they may be. There will always be challenges, and I'd rather get stronger by overcoming them rather than pretending they don't exist. It still hurts so damn bad though.

The upshot of week 2 was that my physical cravings largely subsided. Especially toward the end, there was a lot less fatigue; and I started remembering what ""normal"" feels like again. My breathing has also improved a lot (turns out it wasn't year-long allergies after all...) That said, I haven't been sleeping through the night: Every day, I wake up around 2 or 3, often because of disturbing dreams. I hadn't dreamt in so long--even when I wasn't smoking every day, I don't remember dreaming, probably because I was never sober for long enough to completely get THC out of my system.

That all might sound worrisome, but it's all been for the better. I feel alive again; even when it hurts, I'm happy living in the moment. I realize I was carrying some guilt: Every time I lit up, I knew--consciously or otherwise--that I was avoiding *something*, whether that was responsibilities or emotions. I feel more confident (despite being cheated on), like I'm no longer hiding something. I never want to feel like I'm running away again.

Anyway, I hope this helps someone out there. I'm going to carry on with my head up as I write this new chapter in my life.",34,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6777866}"

I've had so many day ones it's starting to gnaw at my sanity. Like every week, I have like 3 quitting attempts. Needless to say, I'm on day 1 again. 

I'm a day trader, and have had a terrible week this week. I'd like to think that's the reason for my smoking, but really, even on great days I've got to smoke to celebrate. Like wtf. Good mood? Smoke. Bad mood? Smoke. Meh? Smoke. I feel like I'm going insane. 

On the one hand, I have goals to aim at in life, you know, get my career going, work on programming skills, find a girl to settle down with, learn a few foreign languages, support my mom so she retires, buy land and build, start my own company, set up a nice farm and rear animals. The list goes on. Now I know deep within myself that I'm capable of all this and way more. I feel like I just have to work on myself, build small constructive habits and soon enough everything will fall into place. But that shit ain't easy. It requires self discipline and you know what fucks that up the most? Weed. Constantly thinking about it, planning days around sessions. Freaking out, like I am on every day 1, that if I quit, I'm never going to find happiness like I do with weed. My brain has been wired to rely on this shit for 7+ years. I know that given a few weeks, months, it will be completely out of my system, and I will survive, thrive even, without the need for a smoke. But jfc just getting past week 1 is a nightmare. I know i should live one day at a time, just stay sober till tomorrow, but the slightest emotional stimulation, whether +ve or -ve, and I'm on my way to my dealer like a fucking robot. Cognitive dissonance at its best. 

I know deep down, that if I don't quit, I will never amount to anything past the mindless living of most of humanity. You ever know you can be anything in the world, but you just keep screwing yourself over and over? I believe that's what happens to most of humanity. I want to believe I'm better that that, but my actions prove me wrong every fucking day. Honestly I'd rather die that live out such a hollow existence. Don't worry guys, I'm not suicidal or anything like that. 

Tbh, this is not a commitment to quitting for good. I'm painfully aware that relapses WILL happen. I write this here to remind myself of what's truly important to me, hoping to one day find the strength to overcome my own bullshit. Honestly, I wish myself the best of luck.",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6841871}"

She had asked me to come to an event that would (most likely) contain weed and alcohol. I explained that I was now sober from both and that I wouldn't be able to come. We had a small conversation in which I mentioned my withdrawal symptoms. 

She laughed and said, ""There is no such thing as weed withdrawal. It's all in your head. You're just missing the way weed made you feel.""

To be fair, the second part is half true. But, when I tried to explain that there are real physical ramifications to quitting weed, especially after having smoked heavily for over a year, she continued to tell me I was wrong. 

Now, she is a HEAVY smoker and has been for years. She uses weed to self-medicate her anxiety and depression (like most of us!). As I was about to ""go off"" on her and get into a big discussion about the science of THC and the brain, I stopped. I decided that I wasn't going to argue with her since she isn't where I am when it comes to wanting to quit. So, I just said ""Thanks for inviting me to the party, I hope you have a good time"" and left things at that. 

In the past, I would have been savvy to get the last word and try to convince her that she was wrong, but I don't think that serves a purpose, except to make me upset. I'm learning that its OK when some people don't understand what you are going through and its OK to walk away from those people if they don't serve to help you in your sobriety.

It was very hard in the beginning but now I like being sober and don't feel like I have to tolerate it at all. I am not pulled about mentally by this need to be high and it is so worth the terrible first few months. 

I am feeling generally more stable (still have the odd dip) and I have achieved a lot more this year than I would have otherwise. I had emergencies that I could deal with approprieately because I was sober, I'm far less irritable, I eat better and I have been able to see some situations more clearly in terms of my own needs. My joy has returned. My old traumas have gone quiet in my head again. When I was smoking everyday, it was like a mental gate to my trauma was open and I was reliving them all the time. It was a nightmare. I have realised that my focus issues are not necessarily all weed related and have started the process with the doctors to look into ADHD. The main thing is the sense of freedom and flexibility in the day. I'm a bit bummed that my memory didn't recover as much as I hoped but hopefully that will continue to improve. 

If you want to quit and haven't started yet, it is hard but it is so worth it. You'll never regret not getting high. Just take good care of yourself when you do stop. If you can use some holiday days up in the second week, that might be good. You might feel that socialising is too much for a few weeks. Listen to that if it comes up. If you're experiencing anxiety, move a lot at the beginning of the day to metabolise the adrenaline and avoid caffeine. Meditation helped me too.

Started at 15 when I found Moms stash. I turn 40 this year. I did a lot of deceiving myself. My dad was on prescription drugs all his life. I didn’t get to know him until I was an adult. I wondered if he was really crazy or if taking those potent drugs all his life made him crazy. He eventually killed himself. I know I have some of my own demons and I made the decision to not take prescription drugs and the like and just jumped enthusiastically into all natural organic cannabis. 
It didn’t ruin my life, but it was affecting my relationships with others early on, which should have been a clue. I sold bricks and smoked that sweet cheebah all thru college. I made mostly A’s and B’s because I never missed class and did homework when I had to. I met my future wife and we blazed into a family of our own. When I started my career, my faults started to show. I didn’t focus like I needed to and and the necessary socializing that happens at work, I was unavailable for. I would smoke more often when I was depressed and I was pretty much always at least low grade depressed. I travelled far and wide looking for the right strain. Come to find out it didn’t exist. I switched to concentrates and edibles because I got so tired of always smelling like and being paranoid about smelling like potent cannabis. I cringe when I think about when complete strangers or my friends or family would point out that fact that I smelled like a skunk.
      When I had my fist kid, I didn’t quit. Didn’t really even consider stopping. My mom smoked and I turned out ok, right??5 days ago I decided that I was so miserable with the status quo, that something needed to change. The physical symptoms I’ve felt since quitting, stomach cramping, sporadic crying, sweating, hot flashes. Loss of appetite. Trouble sleeping, fucking lucid dreams about relapsing. It’s been an eye opener. My life was centered around  procuring, hiding, and using cannabis and i just reached a breaking point. I’ve quit more than a year at a time at a couple points in my life but each time that I break the sobriety, I go immediately full force into addiction. This time quitting feels different because I made the choice to quit without prompting from anyone else.
Looking forward I want to be more present for my wife and kids. I want to be present for my career and friendships and for myself. If I’m blitzed out of my mind and can’t even articulate what’s on my mind, how could I effectively advocate for myself or the ones I care about in my everyday dealings??  Thank you for the support.

Been here many times before, but this time it feels like it will last. I've spent the past 8 years spending $400+ a month on weed, smoking \~4 joints every day. I would throw out all of my weed shit, bowls, pens, and I'd end up digging them out of the trash or rebuying them days later. But this time it feels different. I know that I have to stop because of how it's affecting every aspect of my life, but it's so easy to convince myself to just get one more bag, or one more cart. But I realize now that every time I smoke it's pulling me farther from who I want to be. My biggest goal for this year is to buy a house, and the fact that I smoked away a downpayment's worth on a house with nothing to show for it is insane to me now. I look at the people on here that are much older than me posting about their addiction, and I know how much deeper I would be in it if I let it go on any longer.

One thing that has made quitting easier for me is simply accepting everything that comes my way. It sounds simple, and I suppose it is. But it really is profound when you think about it. We can't control the majority of external events in our lives, but we can control how we respond. The fact of the matter is that I will not be smoking today, or tomorrow. So my options are to accept it: this could mean anticipating the withdrawals and treating myself like I have the flu, making myself tea, watching Netflix all day, being gentle with myself. Or, I could resist. I could spend all day thinking about how badly I want to smoke, justifying in my head some reason why I should. I could wonder why I'm not able to immediately get up at 6 am, go to the gym, meal prep for the week, do yoga every day, meditate, etc. I could try to distract myself with unhealthy coping mechanisms, but the reality is that I can't run away from myself and whatever I was running away from by smoking weed constantly. I cried every single day for the first week every time I quit, but at a certain point I became grateful for having the ability to feel strong feelings. Even negative feelings are nice after feeling numb for so long. All of these feelings are temporary, and they will pass if I'm able to just observe them without judging. In fact, being able to observe myself sober is incredibly fascinating now that I'm able to see myself more clearly. It's strange to think that I have no idea who I am as an adult without weed, and observing the new thought patterns and ideas in my head since being sober is teaching me a lot about myself, my past, and what I need to work through. While I dreaded this in the past, it really is an opportunity to realize exactly where I'm at and where to go from here.",21,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5058268}"

I workout stoned.) and HOO LEE CHIT the first thing that came to mind was ""this song actually exists?"". I was in fairy tale land this entire time and had a glimpse of the emotions I felt when I would listen to music sober.

 I think a part of always smoking before doing an activity is because we are afraid to experience these emotions. That is when I realized that natural dopamine is like marijuana dopamine but on steroids. It's kinda like how it's better to cook your own food with your own ingredients rather than ordering out even though the gathering process may take longer you are being rewarded in the end, naturally.

And that brings me to the 2nd bird. I don't even want to order take-out anymore because I would rather stir a pot for an hour to make sure everything is right. It's like I've become a crack fiend for the dopamine from these small achievements that I complete sober.

I think the biggest tip is to not take life for granted. It passes by so quickly when your high and your emotions are nulled and your senses handicapped. When you are sober, life begins again as you remembered it pre-weed.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43383116}"

Although the withdrawals are now mostly gone, the mental pull for weed is stronger than ever. Not in a smoke-20-bong-hits-per-day kind of way. More like a “I feel like I would really enjoy a singular joint right now” kind of way. 

My first thought for hitting 2 week sobriety was to celebrate with a joint. Since moderation is key, right? All my friends (who have never had a smoking career like I have) think it’s a bad idea which makes me think I probably shouldn’t.  But then it got me thinking: when was the end to this then? Am I really quitting weed forever… meaning I can never smoke again or did I just want to kick the habit. I didn’t just smoke weed because I was addicted to it, I smoked weed because I actually enjoyed it.

Driving while stoned was something I tried to avoid doing, but let’s be real “tried to avoid” means giving myself 2 hours between getting stoned and getting in the car. I think getting busted/hurt for driving while high was the “you’re in danger now” low water mark I always set for myself but it might never happen, or worse, it might. I’m rambling with no point but was just curious about whether this actually happened to anyone—and then what came after.

Thanks. My first post. Glad I found this place. And if any parents see this and want to talk about the double edged sword of parenting while high, come sit next to me.",26,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4680572}"

Day one was the hardest for me. Why? Lack of confidence and a fear of the unknown. 

If you’ve never quit before, it’s normal to be scared of what the world will look like through the lens of sobriety. This is the fear of the unknown.

If you haven’t quit before (Your true day one) you have no idea if you will make it. The fear of failure often immobilizes us with indecision and complacency. Your confidence is much lower than your fear. 

The moment you get 24hrs without weed, the balance starts to shift between fear and confidence. The fear of the unknown subsides a great deal and your confidence that you can do this skyrockets.

Have had stronger symptoms than I expected. Over the past 3 days, I have only eaten roughly 1200 calories and I still don’t feel hungry. Probably gotten roughly 20 hours sleep since I’ve quit but oddly I don’t feel that tired! The return of REM sleep maybe? I’m sweating so much that the past three days three separate co-workers commented on my smell/perspiration while on the job. My sex drive has been nonexistent. Used to masturbate at least once a day. Haven’t been interested in women or my cock since I’ve quit. Really strange symptom I wasn’t expecting. No dreams at all yet. Even back before using weed I wasn’t much of a dreamer so I’m not surprised by this. 

As for the positives, my overall mood has improved. I feel upbeat, energetic, “alive” and attentive to what’s going on around me. My mind feels much sharper and wittier, like for example I’m able to come up with quick witty jokes with co-workers and customers like I was able to prior to weed use.

I'm happy cause no more stomach pains, I'm still sweating in bed but not as much! Still wake up a lot cause I'm anxious of not waking up for work and the like. When I smoked weed I used to still have vivid dreams. I've had overly vivid dreams and an overactive mind my whole life... now the coming off weed dreams... man it's fully HD like i'm in there. It kind of sucks because I keep dreaming of my ex betraying me nearly every night. I am mostly over him but with these dreams they upset me and put him in my thoughts.. god I want them to stop. I'm sick of seeing him every night with another woman lmao it's pretty upsetting.

Since quitting I've 
- passed my driving theory first time
- saw an old friend and we hung out and he's quit weed, he wants to get involved in the art community locally and we have great ideas together.
- Volunteered at my local gallery again (I used to volunteer when I was 15 and they remember me) and I'm going to apply to become a residential artist there as well so I'll have my own studio space in this awesome weird victorian building which should make me pick up all my art again!!
- Planned my future better slowly with mind maps and steps like the things above.. 
- I'm consistently going to work and doing really well there.

I look forward to actually getting things done after so long.

However, I remember EXACTLY why I used to smoke. I'm a very manic person. I have BPD and CPTSD. I have so much energy which I try to channel positively but it's also a lot of angry energy. The other day I had to go down and up the stairs in my house like 6 times after I made my dinner for a charger and I got so wound up so fast I fucking annihilated these cardboard boxes like a psycho punching the shit out of them and screaming cause I was so fucking pissed off. I can feel my blood boil so fast. Some days I come back from my customer service job where I treat everyone nicely and just... I'm so angry it's like I'm masking.. I come home and I'm just soooooo fucked off and everything fucks me off. I want to scream constantly. I'm goi to pick up roller blading and hope that channels energy.. I'm trynna listen to donna summer and bust some moves, fuck it i'll sing in public if it makes me happy right. 

I used to smoke cause my mania tires me out. I always wanted to damped it cause i'm always on the fucking go..I mean I've missed it.. I've not been manic for like a year now and it's more fun than being in a depressive state I must say.. but it's tiring. I used to smoke to just shut down, calm the mania, shut my mouth, not be around myself... I guess that takes working on the relationship with myself which relates back to one of my earlier post on leaves.

I'm more present with my family, which is sad to think how much I wasn't present and didn't care about it when I was constantly high. I was still there for them but I was just a zombie. I am proactively showing my efforts now. I actually had a big argument the other day with my mum and usually always need a smoke to calm down but I went to bed depressed instead, and the next day made a big effort to cheer the situation up, and it worked. One thing I've always been good at is not letting my ego win over my love and care for someone (albeit my lack of ego gets my own feelings hurt by others sometimes)

I'm slowly moving out of the very foggy brain state but it's still there. I'm starting to feel very tired of myself, days like these I want to smoke. I no longer crave it to play RDR or watch a show or eat food. I'm eating food normally now which I am thankful.

Anyway just a little rant little update.. I'm doing well but .. I wish I could take a break from myself. Even typing that out makes me want to smoke a joint... anyway I think I'll get to some equilibrium of more calmness and mania that I fully approve of.. but it will take work... it will take time and not avoiding... anyway have a good one everyone wish u the best on ur sober journey x",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.71928066}"

I cried alot this morning. I cried a few days ago, and in the hysterical kind of way. Very depressed , world crashing down sort of feeling. Asking what is there to live for. (Not actually suicidal, mostly philosophical and I have alot of actual extreme stressors right now)
I knew the depression would come rolling in, and it did, no surprise. What was a surprise was , I am ok with it. I don't really know what a sober emotional landscape looks like. I don't know what ""a normal amount "" of sadness and desperation is. But I feel. And I realize that any other time (in the last 7 years) I would smoke any time my mood went down. So I never really cried or reached the super lows that I'm feeling now. I had a sort of epiphany that it's ok to cry when I'm sad. So basic right? But not so obvious for someone who totally avoided the feels.

I have actual worries , things in my life I need to stand up and change! I've gotten to the point of feeling indignant - at myself! A part of me like ""how dare I not follow my dream!?"" ""How dare I leave my inner child behind and loose sight of my goals!?"" Of course im sad! Of course im angry! I need to DO SOMETHING about it. And it's been so ...SOBERING to realize --> I can cry when I'm sad because it's fuckin SAD to not truly care for myself. It's SAD to ""not be able"" to have fun without weed. It's SAD to want to smoke before anything, before I want to play with my kids, and if I actually play with them to daydream about how it would be more fun if I was that unattainable ""higher then I am now"".

What a line of shit. 

I have strength to not smoke because the anger of selling myself short has turned to fire. I would rather feel my emotions even if they feel like too much. Because I have hope. Because I know other people can live without it and be happy and in the moment. Because when I was a child I was happy and free and nature was beautiful and the sun was shining and I needed nothing to supplement the glory of the moment.

I started smoking weed when i was 17 on dancing course. It was so great experience for me. Everything was so detailed i remember i stuck looking on floor how great shapes it had and my dance partner was pushing me in shoulder because i wont move. After that we occasionaly smoke weed at my friends house. We dont even know how to roll and our dealer was rolling for us. I remember one time we were walking around table in circles on all 4 like dogs and laughing like crazy. So we did this sessions every month. Around that time i developed asthma as reaction to cat allergy and figured out that weed will make me relaxed and helped me with asthma attack. So we did this sessions more often ( i had excuse). 

Year passed and i have to move to different school in another city because i had some problems with one teacher. Now call it destiny or what. But i ended sitting with guy who was weed dealer for entire school(fun fact: he ended as police officer and last week was convicted for manipulating with child pornography during night shifts). So i was welcomed in biggest smoking group in city how great. Now i had access to best weed. When i showed that weed to my friend in my hometown he introduced me to rest of the group. They were not smoking joints but bongs. How great! It was not so smelly and high was more intense. My friend later said ""bong is what makes weed a hard drug"". I cannot agree more now. 2 years passed i smoked bongs every day after school going home at nights when everyone were sleeping. 

High school ended and i went to university. In first year i met people from first high school which i left. So i was smoking now only on weekends when i went home. Year passed and i met smokers at uni. They also had bongs. We met every day smoking weed all day long. I think in this time i lost control. Joints did nothing to me, but weed helped me focus on study. I was able to be smoked whole night and study. In this time i bough my own bong. My roomates were not happy. But we all passed as bachelors in engineering. I went to get my master degree. But the guys did not wanr to live with me. I smoked every day and moved to guys which were doing bongs. (i choosed weed) 

In this year i met a girl and decided to quit school ( i had problems with short-time memory). We found a flat and lived together. She hoped that i will quit. I did.. But after one argument i went to my friend and we smoked because i wanted to calm down. So she figured out and left me. (i choosed weed) 

Now i was devastated and i didnt want to talk to anyone i wanted to forget. I quit facebook nd cut all my contacts. It lasted 5 years of really heavy smoking i lived alone. sometimes one my.friend lived with me. He smoked more than me and it started to be only purpose in our lives. Work weed sleep every day. I had rule that i will not smoke in the morning before work. This rule stayed with me. I had only few friends and everything went to hell.

I wanted to finally do something and i started company for 3D printing. With two guys from uni which i did not know personally but friend said they are ok and know many things. 
But they were alcoholics and i was only one leading company after a half year with two alcoholics which did only  mess in company. I was smoking every day at night because i had so much work and weed was keeping me awake.It lasted year and half and i was working my regular full time.job from 6 to 14:30 and i had to be in my shop from 15:00 to 19:00 and drawing models from 19:30 to 2-3AM every day except weekends on which i smoked all day because i was tired from work week and i want to be shut down. This lasted 1,5 year until corona came and we have to shut down our shop. 

I met a girl on Tinder and we bought our own apartment. I was still smoking every day. My girlfriend was not happy but i was already deep in weed addiction. I did not saw that anything is wrong. She was reading books all day i was smoking playing games. We had problems with communication, sex and everything. I did not saw that because i was on home office. Cleaning apartment everything except giving proper time to my girlfriend. Year passed. She asked me.many times to smoke less or quit if i cannot smoke less. I ignored her...

It was 6 days ago when she was really pissed off and argued that i should really quit and i cannot do it like that. I was smoked ass hell and wasnt able to reply. But next day i said that i have something left and after that i will quit. So for next 2 days i smoked my ass off. It was too much for me. BIG MISTAKE. 

Next day i was driving a car totaly sucked out of serotonin and dopamine because of weed. I had anger explosions everything was bad, everything a everyone was stupid. In one moment i shout on her ""if you raise your voice again on me you can get out of the car"". I am fucking idiot. It was first day of my windrawal.
We went to my parents on weekend everything seems ok to me.

3th day i started to see more clear and i started to remmeber what i have done. I started to have a nightmares about that my girlfriend is leaving me. I could not be more right. 

I send her message ""good morgning sweetie"" but she did not reply. so i was asking if is something wrong and she reply ""we have to talk"". Ou Shit.... So i went for flowers and wine. But she come home and said that its too late for this and she want to left me.  Because we did not talk we dind have sex because i was too high. I spread my toxic mood around and she stopped smiling.


It was 4th day without weed and i started to see light on the end of the tunnel. I was happy that i can finally make everything better. Everything will be ok i though. Nope. 

I lost another awesome person in my life because of stupid weed. 

Now iam sitting on couch and thinking about how much i want to smoke again and run again away to weed clouds. 
But not this time. I started writing to reddit to keep me busy. Waiting for ex girlfriend when she came back from pub. Looking for better tomorrows. 
I want quit so much, but iam affraid the worst is before me and i dont know how i am going to handle this. 

After 15 years of smoking iam human trash.
I have problems with memory, i have anxiety, social phobia, depression, nightmares i cannot eat i cannot sleep, iam sweating i have that feeling that i need to smoke. I have toxic behaviour to others. Today i started to have diarreaha and i have eaten anything for 3 days. Also i have problems with breathing.

My life is ruined for now. But i will try to be clean. Iam 32 now feeling like scared whining 17 year old boy who dont know how to handle with emotions and how to interact with people. i want to be a man not affraid to get reaponsibility for things. To have some self esteem. 

I hope it will be better. Iam doing small steps. And iam.start to feel.better every day.
I have dog now from this realtionship. We were on walk today and i was trying to start conversation with other people with dogs. It was great to speak to some strangers. But still little shy. I want to travel, excercise and do things like normal human being. Not making plans and then get high and do nothing.

Iam thinking about using some supppement to help me with stress. 

Also i want to say that i smoked weed with tobacco so i have addiction to this also. So i vape but its not the same.

Previously I had only quit for a week at a time for vacations. (Which made me miserable going through withdrawal on a trip). That’s why my goal this time was to make it 2 weeks until my beach trip. I’m proud to say I haven’t even seen weed in 2 weeks. Much less used it. And tomorrow I will get on a 7 am flight and enjoy sobriety with my wonderful fiancé. Life is beautiful you guys.

Got kicked out of my houseshare by formerly stoner best friend of 15+ years.,"I had a real bad, multi-day trip that resulted me going to the ER thinking I had bugs under my skin and in my ear, under advisement from a national medical hotline. Turned out to be fluid behind the ear and an ear infection as a result of accidental overdose of ear drops - (I took these to try and clear earwax while high a few days prior). What are normally fairly mild symptoms had been magnified a hundred fold by super strength cannabis.

The crucial part of this story is that I was specifically instructed not to drive to the ER by the medical hotline. This makes sense for many reasons as I am sure you can fathom.

Cannabis had so warped the mind of my supposed best friend, let us call him A, that he refused to take me to the ER in a supposed medical emergency. As a result I had to do it myself, fighting waves of nausea as I did so. This was Day 2. I could have easily crashed.

This came at the end of increasing tensions between us that had been building over time. Whilst I have, despite my addiction, managed to carve a fairly secure life for myself, A has long stagnated. In typical narcissistic behaviour, he blames everyone else for his situation and refuses to take any action. If I did something wrong, I would get a heap of shit. If someone else did the same thing, there would be a much more benign reaction. Sounds like an abusive relationship right??

I had accepted living in dank conditions in this house as well because my attachment was so strong. I appealed today for help to clean the house top to bottom. Unsurprisingly, none was forthcoming. An argument then ensued. I was still feeling angry and betrayed that A had not helped me in my time of greatest need, and now he felt it appropriate that the house remained in squalor.

No more.  I managed to stuff almost everything in my car while getting berated, and now I am safe at my parents house. I feel emotionally drained, and really sad more than anything. I didn't have any friends before I met A at school. I offered his family's contractor business the opportunity to work on my first development project (which was a shitshow that cost me a significant amount of money to rectify with a real contractor). I was willing to look past all that, and A's friends were supposedly my friends.

This has only emboldened me in my decision to quit though. As I only obtained weed through A, my source of supply has now been cut off anyway.

I was a hardcore stoner dedicated to smoking the plant every day, all day long. I defended it religiously. I even worked as a supervisor at a cannabis dispensary. I truly believed it was helping me through my chronic pain and mental health problems; when in reality, it was holding me back from the growth I needed to be able to properly address these issues.

I wanted to take a moment to celebrate my success as well as perhaps spark some inspiration for everyone who is just starting out as to why we should stick to our paths of sobriety!

This is what a regular day looks like for me now:

I wake up around 6-7AM, something I deeply missed doing as I am a morning person, but not with weed in my system. This also was attributed to the fact that I was seriously sleep-deprived when I smoked because I would stay up until 3AM most nights & now I try to be in bed by midnight at the latest.

Next I do my 20 minutes of meditation, something I also deeply wished I would do when I was still smoking but just didn’t ever have the self-discipline to do. 

Then I eat breakfast. I have seriously changed my diet around for the better. I just didn’t care about what I consumed when I was high. Being able to almost fully ditch sugar because of this change has been most rewarding as it is the biggest trigger for my chronic pain.

Then I take care of myself. Meaning I wash my face every single morning (something I constantly shamed myself about not staying consistent with when using cannabis as I struggle with acne) and do my hair and get properly dressed for my day. Seriously, this alone has increased my confidence so much, as self-care/grooming can really be neglected when stuck in a cycle of addiction. I also stopped picking my face, which in turn has dramatically improved my acne. My self-esteem and insecurities have greatly improved and I am less self-conscious about what others think of me and more focused on truly loving the real me.

Then I get on with my day with a big smile on my face knowing I CAN face the ups AND the downs in life because I am a capable human being. This was hard to believe when still smoking as I believed I needed to smoke to embody this feeling. Thats just it though, smoking may have given me that FEELING, but it was just a feeling. Now, without smoking, I can actually move on to the next step with this motivating feeling: ACTION!

I have addressed so many traumas and deep-seated issues I had been masking and repressing with weed for years. I developed & strengthened my psychic abilities and have found joy in new hobbies (like tarot & playing crystal sound bowls) that help me expand as a person, not hold me back as weed did.

One of the most rewarding benefits for me has been that I am able to stay present during my day to focus on what I need to get done (on my phone & social media a LOT less - even kicked Snapchat to the curb the same time as weed and that was my biggest time waster) and most importantly, being able to actually be present and enjoy time spent with my children.

The biggest reason I quit was for my kids, but also for my own health and career. I was drifting through my psychology degree barely progressing when I am more than capable. I just finished my first full semester of senior university classes with straight A’s!

I hope sharing my story can help motivate you to keep going. If you fall off the wagon have compassion for yourself. Remember you can keep working towards your goal of living a life free from weed and that so many people will never be as strong as you to even attempt this feat! Its not all sunshine & rainbows, I still have temptation from time to time, but then I reflect on all of these improvements and remember why I cannot go back to my previous way of living!

You are amazing, you got this, and sending so much love & strength to all who need it!

The symptoms have lessened a lot, but the depression and anxiety is hard to kick. My therapist tries to remind me that I am too hard on myself and that I need to be alright with myself where I am today. I have taken up the mantra of telling myself ""You are doing enough. You are enough.""

My aunt (I live in an apartment below her) has told me that she needs more ""alone time"" without me up there in her apartment. I've been spending most of my time with her during this entire process because I fear being alone with myself. I fear spiraling into my depression and I fear relapsing. I'm just afraid to be alone. I have lived alone most of my life and we used to spend a lot of time apart so this feeling is very new to me.

It reminds me of when my ex (whom I was deeply in love with) left me alone after my mother died. He went on a vacation without me for three weeks with his buddies about a month after my mother passed away. He and I were living together in a house he just bought and when he left it felt like a void opened up and swallowed me. I spiraled out of control and began experiencing extreme health issues that no one could figure out. I went to doctor after doctor after doctor and was told ""it is all in your head"". I became depressed. He broke up with me after that.

I fear falling into that same hole that I did then and so, being alone without weed to prop me up is extremely scary to me. I don't seem to like any of the things I used to and I feel like I am not at home in my apartment anymore. 

Anyway, that's the long and short of it. I don't have much choice except to deal with it and try my best. I am hoping that I will continue to improve and, maybe, learn that I am not the same person I was back then and I wont fall into that hole.

I am currently in the process of quitting smoking, both weed and cigs. It’s rough. I am hopefully through the immediate agonies of quitting regular tobacco, about a week in, but I’m still on and off with weed, which is the bigger challenge and the one that I’m psychologically reliant on.

I’m looking for tips on how to improve my recovery process. I (30, M) am a bit of wreck right now, physically speaking. Smoking has left a huge dent in my fitness, and my head is a foggy haze. Obviously, sleep, good food, and water, are necessary. But I feel pretty terrible, and I wonder if there are more specific tips on improving one’s physical recovery after a period of substance abuse you can share with me?

Usually, I would start with yoga, but I barely feel up to it. Just went on a long walk with my parter and I’m exhausted. Even something as simple as reading feels difficult.

My brain clearly wants to fix the damage done by weed with weed. It has been conditioned that way. I am used to digging the hole deeper when I’m feeling this rough. Cravings are gonna be wild.

I googled it and read an article about a 17 year old who died from it after moderate use for three years. I know it’s rare but for some reason this was the thing that pushed me over the edge.

Do not wait for rock bottom to hit!!","I was a daily smoker for 13 yrs. I am on day 4. I had quit for a year or so back in 2014 and then when my life was starting to turn around I re-introduced marijuana and have been a daily smoker since. 

I hit rock bottom on the 4th of July this year when I found out that my partner wanted to separate (not due to my smoking). I had told her the week before that I was quitting (prob for the 50th time) and that I realize I have a problem, no one should smoke all day, I need to improve my life, etc. I have a counselor that I talk to about my usage (among other issues) and have been trying to cut back and quit. The thing is, no matter how bad I wanted too, I couldn't commit. Well, on the 4th I threw everything out. Everything! And only bc I was losing my family. 

See, I wasn't living life. I was just going through the motions. I would come home from work and smoke and stare at my phone until she got home. No motivation, no drive, minimal help around the house. Just smoking and letting life pass me by. I wasn't working to improve myself. I didn't have a healthy relationship with Marijuana or my partner. 

I have been aware of my personal issues for as long as I can remember. I knew I didn't grow up in a healthy household, I knew I had anger/depression/anxiety issues, and the thing is, I was working on it. But it wasn't enough. I still had my vice, my crutch, my daily relaxer that allowed me to numb everything and keep floating through life without living it or actually facing and changing my problems. I would go to my counseling sessions, walk out of there feeling a little better but the next day was right back to the old ways. 

Now that my partner is leaving, I have all the clarity in the world. I see the light. I know what I need to do and its going to be damn hard. This isn't about marijuana and quitting, that seems so easy to me right now. The hard part is going to be facing all the issues head on that I used to use marijuana to hide from, facing them head on and improving myself so that I can win back my family. 

I didn't treat my partner the best. I wasn't physically abusive but I didn't show her the love and respect she deserves. I attribute a lot of this to my parents relationship. I'm not sure if I've ever seen my dad tell my mom he loves her, constant belittling and snide comments, and yet they are still together, my mom is a saint. But the point here is that I have known I had these personal issues and I wasn't really making the changes I needed to make to improve myself. 

What I am trying to get across here is that no one can help you but you. Sure people can support you or lend a hand or give guidance, but it all comes back to you having the drive to change yourself for the better. I thought I wanted to quit smoking last week and this week its been a cake walk bc I am losing my family and I hurt so much from that that I literally have 0 thoughts about marijuana or smoking. Don't be like me and wait until the pain is so unbearable from hitting rock bottom that quitting smoking is the easiest task in front of me now.  I have 0 urge to smoke but the amount of pain in my heart right now almost feels unbearable. 

I have a big task ahead of me, and I am lucky to have built up a bit of a support system over the past 4 days but now what needs to happen is I turn all the hurt and pain I have into motivation to change. Trust me you do not want to wait until your life hits this point to start making the change. Rip off the Band-Aid and start helping yourself! You need to face your problems head on, not hide from them with marijuana.

I like to think I was quite a functional stoner, as during that time I had no problem holding down a job and attended university whilst doing so, ultimately graduating with a first class honours degree. I also took on additional voluntary work at the university, and despite the social anxiety brought on by my weed use, maintained something of a social life (until the last year). 

2 weeks today was when I began going cold turkey and I haven't touched the stuff since. The first week was really rough for me, I've always struggled with getting to sleep and without smoking I was only getting around 2-3 hours sleep a night despite being tired all day and my emotions were all over the place as a result. But I pushed through, tried eating well when I could eat and exercised when I had the energy to do so. I'm now getting more sleep (albiet with super vivid and exhausting dreams) but I think I'm really struggling with anger, impulse control and just generally letting things go.

In the last week alone, I've fallen out with my family for issues that originated from around the age I started smoking weed, which makes me strongly believe that I used weed as a for of repressing and controlling negative emotions. and now at work, I think i'm on the verge of being fired and honestly, I just keep on pushing things further. I just can't seem to help myself. 

To give an insight as to why I believe that... I work for an organisation that essentially has a toxic nice culture, whereby if you provide any feedback that isn't exactly what they want to hear you get repremanded. I've noticed that the organisation is incredibily inefficent and I've raised this several times through the offical channels and although I've been thanked for this and people agree'd nothing happens out of a fear of hurting someones feelings. Usually, I would be able to let this go, but Sober me seems to be incapable of doing so, so i ended up drafting up a 1000 word report that was purely objective and based on figures to highlight how much has been wasted and sent it to upper-managament. Since then, I've been given the silent treatment from my manager and those above them and I just can't bring myself to continue being a part of something so ineffective and inefficent - anyway sorry i'm getting to far into it again... I have a strong feeling that I'm going to be let go soon as a result of not being able to just sit down and shut up and fall in line like everyone else, despite being very competant with my job.

I had this problem way back in school before I started smoking weed as well, I was constantly arguing/clashing with teachers and other authority figures. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced the same or something similiar? I think weed made me much more passive and docile but now that I've stopped everything come back in full force and now I have the additonal confidence of being quite educated. maybe I'm just too confident now? weed did give me a lot of anxiety which i think maybe helped me in a way.

Before I quit I would smoke at least 2 joints per day. Quitting wasn’t easy, but I knew it was a step in the right direction. Below is a timeline of my journey to sobriety.

Day 1: still feel “high”, brain fog here and there, cravings are intermittent, short term memory loss, depersonalization 

Day 7: brain fog still present, sensory memory is starting to come back. Short term memory loss is subsiding. Intermittent nightmares/strange dreams, feelings of despair, sadness, irrational fears, irritation

Day 10: less brain fog, gathering my thoughts better, little to no motivation, still feeling irritated, despair, irrational fears. Cravings are still present

Day 14: paranoia/anxiety subsiding, no more nightmares, better sleep, organized thought process, more socially active, less cravings

Day 21: motivation is back, mental fog is almost completely gone, sensory memory has improved significantly, able to stay focused without trying hard, anxiety is at its lowest in years, life generally feels more “real”

Day 25: I haven’t been this happy in a while. I can stay focused, I can hold a proper conversation, my social anxiety is almost gone, my cravings are barely there, i am more comfortable in my own skin, Im forming friendships/relationships that I thought I could never have and I actually WANT to do things. 

I’ve always been told that marijuana was the answer to helping me cope. Feeling depressed? Weed. Feeling anxious? Weed. Gonna go eat some food? Weed first. All of this just reinforced mental instability. Whenever I told others it wasn’t really helping I was told I was using the wrong strain. My feelings were thrown under the rug and people just wanted me to be apart of their addictions. 

It took me too long to realize that those type of people will get you nowhere in life, they’re not real friends. I had enough of people treating me like a doormat, telling me what is right and wrong for my own life. I respectfully walked away from this lifestyle and got my life back. 

When you want to improve as a person, there’s no person or substance that can take that away from you. It’s your God given right. Even if it means letting go of people, leaving things behind and stepping away from your comfort zone. Take it from me, Don’t let anyone tell you what’s right for YOU. Don’t let anyone mock you for wanting to quit drugs. In the end, only YOU know you. 

With that said, I owe it all to God for helping me get through this situation. I know I couldn’t have done it without him, and my relationship with him has strengthened like never before.

Long time member but first post.","I first smoked weed out of curiosity in 10th grade. Then, for 5 years, I was smoking it like 5-9 times a year. After 5 years, I smoked it everyday for almost three years. Then, I quit. I then started it again after quitting for a year and a few months. When I started smoking again I was smoking very less compared to before like maybe 2-4 times a month for almost a year. Then, I quit again. Now, it's been two months since I last smoked. But I really miss listening to music, watching movies, trekking, camping, etc. while high.  


I also extremely miss the nostalgic and melancholic feelings I get while high. Whenever I think about anything, it's like I'm literally inside the thing I'm thinking about. Like I usually remember my childhood while high and I remember little things from my childhood which I didn't know I was still capable of remembering. It's like I'm literally in that place and feeling the exact same feelings I felt as a child again. I always tear up. Such a beautiful, indescribable feeling.  


I'm always tempted to go to that corner which is a 15 minute cab ride, meet my dealer, (she's a 40 year old woman who's been dealing there in that SAME SPOT since her early 30s LOL) buy weed, come back home, smoke, listen to music, go to the countryside (2 hour car ride from my town) for a trek in nature, look at the beautiful clouds, sun and sky, admire the little details, get nostalgic, have euphoric, beautiful, indescribable feelings, remember my childhood while watching the sunset, become melancholic, come back home, roll another one, watch  movie and sleep.  


Problem is I can't enjoy these activities anymore when not high. I can't get those nostalgic, melancholic, beautiful, indescribable feelings anymore. I don't enjoy music or movies anymore. I had these same problems the whole year when I quit, which I mentioned before, before starting again. These were the reasons I started again in the first place. That year was the most boring, dry and dull year ever. I tried replacing weed with alcohol but I just can't enjoy alcohol. I always drink till I'm piss drunk and can't even walk anymore and do things I regret the next day.  


Can anyone please help me like giving me any suggestions on how to be able to enjoy those activities and hobbies again. Oh, I only started enjoying trekking, camping and nature after I started smoking weed because I notice the little details and because of those feelings it brings out in me.

I just can't get my mind out of thinking about weed. There where times where I would smoke from morning to night, even during my work breaks or would just stay home alone smoking.

I've tried many times to stop smoking but without success, the emotions and frustrations of my life just resurface every time I try to stop. That has literally made me cry on occasion (I'm a 29 year or male that doesn't cry easily)

I have gotten it under control sometimes, but at the end it just gets the best of me.

I do poses a desire to stop smoking, but my current partner doesn't see a problem with it as long as it isn't negatively effecting me. And the thing is for the longest time I didn't think it was, but it has been harder to get up in the mornings, I feel less motivated, my mind feels completely scattered when I don't smoke for a day or two and I can feel a different side of myself returning (completely sober self). I feel so guilty for convincing myself that in the past I haven't had a problem simply because I exercised decent self control and I feel I did a lot more damage by not confronting the problem head on. My tolerance got to the point where I was smoking 2.5-3g of wax a day as well as 4-5g of bud just to get a little blitzed (natural tolerance is also insane).

A few days ago I was messaged by someone here in r/leaves after I made a post about struggling. To my surprise, I was gifted with some wonderful wisdom and encouragement. It took me down a path of introspection that I hadn't considered even attempting.

I began to see that my withdrawal symptoms, while absolutely uncomfortable, unpredictable and awful, were not a punishment but, instead, an opportunity to ask myself a lot of questions about my mental health and its relationship to marijuana.

Instead of hating things about myself, I discovered that it's Ok to accept these things and ask questions like ""Why do I feel this way?"" ""What is making me want to smoke?"" ""How am I feeling about XYZ?"".

It seems so simple on the surface, but introspection can be scary--I still don't feel totally comfortable diving into my brain sometimes. It can be a scary place, especially when we haven't been there in a while.

The point is: you're not broken, you haven't failed and you aren't ""stuck"" the way you are. It's Ok to sit with yourself and your feelings and ask ""Why?"". Don't worry, I'll be right there with you. <3",9,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.47561002}"

Recently it became my addiction because i was smoking daily and putting off important things just to smoke. So the day after 4/20 i gave up smoking with a HEAVY smoke sesh. It was great but it was the end. I was sober for a whole month and my life changed a lot for the better and i thought i had beat it. Then i went on vacation for 3 weeks with my fam and i had lots of clarity and told myself i could smoke responsibly now. 2 weeks ago i came back from vacation and BAM. Fell right back into it. I smoked around a half oz of weed within 2 weeks and i went right down the shitter. Im an uber eats driver and I've only worked 2 days so far and my self esteem has gone way down. Yesterday, i was going ""to work and smoke after"" but i ended up going to smoke more weed and didnt work at all. During the high i realized this was a huge problem in my life and it needed to end NOW. I had 2 joints left so i said ""fuck it. If my addiction ends today then im gonna fuckin send it and finish all of it."" So thats what i did. I smoked 2 joints in my car and that was it.
Something funny that happened was on my last puff, some dude got mad at me for smoking behind his house and told me to leave. I took that as a sign from the universe that weed is no longer for me. So i went to sonic to get an ice cream to feel better. I felt bad because i was spending money without thinking again but turns out my order took longer than expected and they gave it to me for free! I took that as another sign of support from the universe lol. 
But yeah its day 1 and i feel kinda meh today but im playing The Last of Us for the first time so thats keeping me busy.

Effectively this would change my friend group entirely to kids I would just hang out with to smoke with. Having quit now I feel very lonely with minimal friends.

I’m housesitting for some friends, and they have all the weed I could indulge in if I wanted to. And it’s really hard.

I feel so much better without the fog brain sludge feeling. Smoking has always made me feel invincible, giving me more confidence, I suffer from anxiety, and I thought that it helped, that was the lie. We all suffer from things that causes us to smoke, and I don’t wanna list every single one thing, but I know that working on it alone is hard, so I thought I’d post for the first time.

Yesterday I ran out of weed and I was convinced to stop it once and for all, thankfully it is not that easy for me to obtain weed, which is probably the only reason I'm still sober after a single fucking day, because when I try to step out of weed at first it is only dreams about finally being independent from my inner demons and stop being a slave to myself, I know too damn well if I had smoked a joint a couple of minutes ago I'd be feeling bad, telling myself the same stories about how I am destroying myself little by little, but the hard truth is when I don't have weed I feel even worse, I just wait for days to pass one after another without a glimpse of motivation to do anything.

&#x200B;

I was diagnosed with severe weed dependency. I've been seeing a weed dependency counselor/psychologist since March. We developed a plan for my quit date (first day of sobriety) on July 4th. I had practice quit dates throughout March/April/May/June. I am really confident in my **feelings** about being done with weed and semi-confident in my ability to say no. I got rid of all of my stashes, gave most of my pieces and accessories to my friends that still smoke, and have a strong motivation. I'm feeling okay. I'm bipolar so most of my withdraw symptoms are mood related so far (I get really really down and disassociate really easily if I'm alone) based on my practice quits. I dipped a little yesterday but then I went out to Taco Tuesday with some supportive pals.   


SO. Later today I am going to my best pals place to meet J's new girlfriend. The two of my best friends from college (M & A) that will be there smoke and we've smoked together most of our friendship. They are really supportive and I know they are not going to pressure me and probably won't even ask me to join. This is where I get worried. I want to be invited still. I feel like what's going to be hardest is dealing with the FOMO of them being outside smoking and laughing and me being inside just sitting and watching A's wife play a videogame. I don't like just staring at screens so I am anticipating a mood dip and getting emotional when I don't want to do that. She's been so excited for me to quit so she has someone to hang out with while they smoke since she doesn't smoke. I think I can sit outside in the circle and just pass so I can hang with M & A to help negate the FOMO.

My life is not terrible when I think about it, I've somehow managed to find and keep a cushy high paying job for the past few years but I've realised a while ago money isn't everything. Weed really prevents you from taking action on your purpose.  It has been holding me back from doing some other stuff I wanted to be doing. It also prevents me (personally) from socialising, as I'd often prefer to be high at home alone. If I weren't high or constantly rushing to get home as soon as possible anticipating getting high then I'd be open to more social encounters.

2021-07-07 11:05:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ofkpoj/7_month_milestone/,7 Month Milestone,"Hi /r/leaves,

While I am proud of myself for not smoking for 7 months, I need to be honest with everyone and myself with this post. The next few paragraphs are background to what got me to decide to quit smoking - feel free to skip if you just want to see the results of abstaining from smoking.  

> Had a good childhood, parents divorced when I was 16, moved away from home at 17, and never returned.  Started smoking at 15, became a daily smoker at 19, and stopped at 40.  This seven months has been the longest period in which I have not smoked - *I am proud of this accomplishment and plan on continuing in abstaining.*  I have lived the last 19 years in Portland, OR and lived through the legalization process of marijuana when there.  The culture of having high quality weed available was established and after moving to Oregon after college thought I had ""found my people.""  I have since moved away, which helped in this process, more on this later.  

> Quick milestones which have led me here - got married to first love from college (22), had two children (25 and 28), then my wife left me (31), and I spent many years single.  The divorce really destroyed me.  I had a mental breakdown episode which almost cost me my job and access to my children - I didn't put anyone in danger other than myself, thank God.  That's the lowest point in my life and it took me many years to rebuild myself - I often wonder if I really ever had or will.  Financially, I'm still struggling to keep up with my life. 

> After some time, I met and married my wife (37), and had a third child (38).  After the 'honeymoon' stage of my second marriage, things started getting really complicated in my life.  My ex-wife started to try and dictate what went on in my household and started turning my two daughters from my first marriage against me, my wife, and our son.  I wasn't able to participate as much in my daughters' extracurricular activities due to the commitment of raising an infant.  My ex-wife's intrusions became so bad that she snuck my daughters out of our house the night prior to my son's first birthday party so they could go skiing - an activity planned by my ex-wife that I did not condone.  At this point, my previously ""amicable"" divorce became very challenging, and I lawyered up.  My wife spent a month living with her brother with our son to get away from the drama - very hard for me - smoked a lot during this time.  I don't think my relationship has fully recovered after this separation and it's difficult for me to even admit this.

> In November 2020 my wife and I decided to move from Oregon to be closer to her family in New Jersey.  I'm happy for both my son and her to have an extended family to be around (which we didn't have in Oregon), but I'm devastated from leaving my two daughters (12 and 15) back in Oregon.  This was a difficult decision to make, but I still feel it's best for everyone to remove drama from our lives.  I've landed a good job, bought a house (first time since divorce!), and am paying down old debt.  Incurring more this month with lawyer fees and flying my daughters here, but I'm still optimistic I can make it work.  Life is challenging for me still - I was even getting weed shipped to me in NJ until the end of the year.  I'm in tears right now, but I feel it's important for people to understand my circumstance and challenges in life.

> I left my support system and am working to rebuild it, but I am failing it - I still need to get a primary care provider and therapist, but I'm trying not to be too hard on myself.  I was diagnosed with ADHD last fall and have battled depression/anxiety my entire adult life - makes sense why I self medicated with weed.  On to the good stuff!

**Results of Leaving Weed Behind**

* Pro: Not spending $500+/month on a selfish drug habit

* Pro: Being more grounded in my reality and having to confront many personal issues

* Pro: Being more clear-headed and honest with myself

* Pro: Not having to hide a bad habit from those closest to me

* Pro: Being more religious/spiritual - I rely on prayer and 'letting things go' more than I ever have before.  I'm starting to work on my mindfulness again.  I'm taking small steps toward healing myself - not doing great, but again, I'm trying not to be hard on myself.  

* Pro: Reading - I can read again.  I spend most nights reading for a half hour before bed.  This is a life-saver for me - it gives me a little time to myself away from the worries of my life and helps me fall asleep.  

* Pro: Finding support and supporting others in this community - people here are very truthful, supportive, and non-judgmental.  I've not found anyone else besides people I pay for help that act his way.  Eternal thanks to all here. 

* Pro: Dreaming again.  Sometimes I have very vivid dreams about weed, but most the time they are nice and a good experience.

* Con: I'm drinking more...  I need to not drink so much.  It's becoming an almost daily habit and that's not good.  It's starting to become a substitute for my weed use and is masking much of the progress I made with myself.  I'm very ashamed of this and am hiding it from those around me.  I used to not be a drinker, but I see myself becoming one and it's scaring me.  

* Con: Eating more.  I used to 'reward' myself with a smoke - I moved that poor behavior to eating food I enjoy.  I've since curbed my eating and am working on losing weight and incorporating exercise back into my life.  

* Con: Occasionally thinking weed can help me move on in life - this is a trap for me.  I am staying the course of abstinence.  

Questions I have: Why am I not able to just enjoy life as it is?  Why do I feel the need to alter my state of mind to cope?  How do I incorporate exercise in my busy life?

Last night was night 3 and I slept for a solid 5 hours according to my health app. My boyfriend and I still sweat but the towel under the shirt trick really does the job. Yesterday I was able to get all of my laundry done even though it took me hours of focus to try to do it. I’m proud of that. I basically felt okay for the first half of the day but definitely really off as soon as the later half of the day started. 

Still not able to stomach things but my boyfriend was able to eat a bowl of chicken soup last night. I’m still getting by on my crackers, smoothies, and protein shakes combo. I’m really hoping I can eat more solid things without wanting to throw up every single time. 

I realized something that made me so incredibly sad yesterday and it’s probably going to sound stupid but.. I was rewatching New Girl for the 8th time in my life.. and I found myself not remembering certain things from episodes and being surprised when I watched certain scenes. How is it that I’ve seen this show almost 8 times and I was having a hard time remembering certain plot points in a show that I LOVE LOVE LOVE. 

It’s 7:43 am on day 4. I’m writing this after waking up feeling so low. Almost worse than I woke up yesterday. I think it’s actually the no appetite finally coming in to tell me that my body is starved and tired. I’m going to try my hardest to get some chicken soup down soon and then listen to my body and sleep. I don’t remember the last time I felt this exhausted BUT I do feel clearer. 

These last couple of days have been an emotional rollercoaster as I’ve cried EVERY SINGLE DAY. But I realize now I’m just readjusting to FEELING things again. I feel both dead and alive at the same time right now. So I guess I’m kind of indifferent to this process this time around but that’s also withdrawal brain speaking so.

I never had a job, I am on the second year of college, and I can not study. The main reason is I just don't care. I don't care if I ever finish school, I don't care if I ever get a job, if I ever get my own apartment. I am pretty sure that it was all caused by weed. I just get high and do nothing. Right now I am not studying because all these emotions of regret and sadness. I don't know how to cope. I was considering suicide for short time, but can't do that to my family. You see, I don't have any aspiration to live, to become someone, or to do anything worth saying. I don't know about advices, I really dont think anything anyone is going to say is going to help me. I have been on this sub for cca 5 years... Don't know why I'm writing this. Just wanted to vent I guess. Put that all aside, you guys are great and have helped a lot of people, I just don't think there is any help for me.

There was trauma my sophomore year, and then I started contemplating suicide, then planning it. But after I started smoking weed I got a couple of friends outside the choir and stopped feeling suicidal. (Would you believe it?) In 2019, I graduated with a degree I didn't even want. That's what a cult mindset will get you. And then I had to move home while my dad had a year-long break from reality. And then Covid happened. I have been using weed to cope with the solitude and the pain of it all.

But I moved out again last month, and reconnected with three old smoking buddies, in effect my only friends. My daily smoking habit drug on into the lease. Then disillusionment set in. I realized that one of them just uses me for sex, the other one has narcissistic tendencies, and the third is a sleaze. I also worry about my mental health. I've begun to experience brief moments of depersonalization while high, and I can't concentrate. It's about time I had some real friends, so I got rid of my little smoking supply box which I had formerly been toting around for about 5 years.

I’m listing 30 shitty things I’ve done /dislike due to my marijuana addiction as a reminder to myself why I’m done smoking. I chose to share because I’ve never told anyone some of these things and also I figured many of you will be able to relate to some of them and will help remind you as well why we don’t smoke.

1) When I smoke I cannot moderate, I will smoke all day starting at 7am till 10pm when I go to sleep. This means I am literally never fully clear headed.

2) When I smoke I eat complete garbage and never cook for myself.

3) when I smoke I lie to my friends about “plans” I have when in reality I’m ditching them to go home and get high

4) I’ve stolen weed from my friends 

5) I’ve skipped family events to get high. I’ve had occasions where my parents would want to get ice cream/dinner/go to a movie or something and I decline. I now live 45 minutes away from them and they’re divorced and feel like I’ve missed out .

6) I’ve hit up people just because I was dry and wanted to smoke, not because I actually wanted to chill.

7) I’ve abandoned practically every hobby/ new skill I tried to learn such as guitar etc.

8) I went from reading all the time to not reading for years 

9) I’ve cancelled opportunities to go on dates because I was high and had anxiety 

10) I’ve made my anxiety far worse 

11) I’ve woken up ona beautiful day and spent the entire time inside on my phone or playing video games. At first I’d tell myself I was gonna get high and go hiking or something but that never actually happens.

12) I’ve spent A LOT of money 

13) I’ve sat around for hours with friends trying to score a bag Instead of actually going and doing something fun

14) my career hasn’t progressed as much as many of my friends I went to college with

15) I’m naturally lazy, weed only intensified this 

16) I’ve sketched out hard about a workplace drug test 

17) I started smoking at 15, I’m 28 now so I’m literally 2 years shy of smoking half of my life 

18) I’ve had a strong panic attack from a 400mg edible 

19)my breathing has gotten bad, noticeably short of breath 

20) I’ve had more than one close call with the police (before it was legal here )

21) I’ve neglected aspects of my life that I’m unhappy with

22) when i smoke everyday I’m an irritable dick when I come down

23) I’ve lost my train of thought and sounded dumb more times than I can count

24) I’ve said things that werent meant to be offensive but because I couldn’t properly articulate myself they came out wrong and caused issues.

25) related to the lung one above I’ve developed a minor smokers cough

26) if I combine weed with alcohol my memory becomes very spotty

27) even without alcohol my memory is poor. I can’t remember  on Friday what I did on Monday 

28) I’ve put off simple tasks for years like setting up my workshop (ill do it tmrw, I’ll do it this weekend, I’ll do it next weekend, I’ll do it when it gets warm out etc etc)

29) I’ve spent years convincing myself that people can’t tell when I’m high but in reality people see me as a  “pothead” and are just too polite to call me out 

30) high me just daydreams about a better version of me instead of actually trying to become him

31) Late addition here but super common one for me is when I’m high I always am losing shit. I’ll put my keys, wallet, phone down somewhere random without actually registering where I’m putting them. I then have to spend the rest of the high searching for my wallet that’s in my refrigerator lol",114,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.74429464}"

I started smoking in high school. It was occasional, fun, and I think relatively harmless at the time. When I moved out to college, I gradually increased my usage until I was a daily smoker, even multiple times throughout the day. I convinced myself that it wasn't a problem. I was able to get good grades, maintain a social life, and smoke on the side, I was pretty damn sure I had life all figured out. Mr. Willpower. I had been able to quit cigarettes completely, furthering my idea that I could stop anything if I decided I needed to, and that I just didn't need to. 

But, life moves on. Eventually I've made it to professional school, working on a medical doctorate. I wouldn't smoke in the mornings or during the school day, but I always topped off the night with at least a bowl while I sat and unwound from the day. In some ways, I don't think this is an awful system. However, moving about halfway through my program, I started to notice my anxiety skyrocketing in general. I would find myself beginning to have panic attacks for no discernible reason. 

I had had a couple of instances of panic attacks in the past, and I realized that they were always when I had smoked too much and received too much stimulus. Those particular attacks had gotten so bad that I straight up passed out. These anxiety attacks while sober throughout the day were all about me being afraid that I would collapse again, I was panicking about having a panic attack. 

I've noticed that over the past couple of years, smoking isn't what it used to be for me. I think I'm in love with the ritual, and what it used to do for me. I never enjoy the current high in the same way. I think about how nice it would be, smoke some, realize I don't feel very great, then wake up the next day and start the cycle again. 

Smoking makes me anxious now. I don't smoke and go out anymore. I don't smoke and enjoy car rides anymore. I don't like to smoke around people anymore. But perhaps most importantly, I don't want to live in a fog anymore. I've realized my memory isn't great, and I'm afraid I did that to myself. But, I think it's time to change.

I think I've known for a good while that weed just isn't what it used to be to me anymore. Times change, people change. I think it's time for this guy to change.

I’m just going to start typing and maybe this will be a long rant maybe just a short story but I feel like I need to get some things out there and said. Also keep in mind i’m a 20 year old male.

I’d say everything started last summer when my life changed a lot, I got my first job (a grocery store where I just put in my 2 weeks yesterday) I started smoking, I met one of the best people ever, a girl who I ended up being in a relationship with for 8 months and ended sort of rough for me leading me to smoke more often.

I smoked a fair amount of weed but the thing I believe really messed me up was smoking carts. They were so easy and convenient that I smoked them all the time, eventually going through 3-4 carts a week. It got bad enough that earlier this year I wasn’t even getting high anymore and when the high went, the anxiety came.

One day the anxiety was so bad that I sat in my car before work and just cried. I wasn’t sure exactly why but I just broke down. That told me I should stop smoking. I decided right there to quit and the next day I threw away everything I had, rolling papers, cart battery, weed grinder, bowl, everything. 

This was good but it was only the start of my problems. Quitting sent me into a weed withdrawal (mixed with cart withdrawals which i learned were worse) which gave me anxiety, sweating a lot (especially at night), loss of weight (down to 125), chest pains, etc…

The next month or so were incredibly hard to get through but I managed to do it and made a turn around and felt much better for a while. Great right? Well guys i’m sad to say I’ve fell down the rabbit hole again. 

I’ve gone back to smoking although no carts, just weed. It’s not quite the same experience as before but some chest pains are back, and the health anxiety is definitely back. 3 nights ago (Saturday night, posting on Tuesday) I went to a party and got hammered and although I had a blast I haven’t felt great since and today noticed a slight pain in my stomach, between the belly button and sternum and of course made the golden mistake of looking it up and boom. Results say gastritis which could mean ulcers which could cause stomach cancer. 

On top of this i’ve had some sleepless nights staying awake and thinking about the girl I previously mentioned. Maybe too much information here but i’ve had sex with 2-3 girls on different occasions since her and it’s like I can’t feel any connections anymore and can have sex and never text them again without feeling a thing.

2021-07-06 17:30:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/of4law/one_month_off_weed_this_is_my_story/,"One month off weed, this is my story.","Hi guys, just wanted to share my experience with this sub and MJ in general, so today I hit one month off weed in the last one and a half year, no cravings, lots of withdrawal symptoms, but lets start with the beginning.

I was a heavy daily smoker, basically smoking my stash out and contacting my dealer for some more, until I was out of money, then I would brainstorm on how to make more money to buy some more weed, I couldn't eat without it, I couldn't sleep without it, basically I couldn't live without it. 

I struggled in the past with what I think it was alcoholism, but if I try to remember harder, until the hangovers became scary, I didn't even think to quit.

It all started with a trip to another city for work, with people from the same company, but from other cities, we were working from 6:30am to 2:30pm, the whole thing lasted a week and I didn't smoke there because I couldn't bring the herbs with me. In that week I slept like 10 to 12 hours in total the rest of the time was spent drinking huge amounts of beer. I had a g saved for when I would come home and you might guessed it, the first thing I did when I got home was to roll myself a joint and blaze it, all good smoked it and enjoyed my high until suddenly I felt like an powerfull electric wave on all of the left side of my body, which was scary as hell, the first thing I thought was that I was having a heart attack (I am diagnosed with high blood pressure), but I managed to calm myself down and go to sleep. The next day my brother came at my house to you know, smoke, and so happened that a colleague of mine which with I smoked before wanted to bring a friend who never did it to try with us, my sleep depraved brain didn't thought that it was a terrible idea, I even rolled a giant j with almost 0.6g of strong weed in it. In my country is illegal so I didn't know what I bought, but I was happy that it would fuck me up good, I would feel it from the first puff. So the guys came and we blazed it, all good, we were laughing and talking about the work trip, but I noticed the newbie was a little too silent, asked him how he feels and all he could said was ""It fucked me up"" then he passed out, I catched him before he could fall and hurt himself, put him down, smacked him good and he eventually woke up, he was good, the problem was that after this event, I couldn't calm down, my heart was beating super hard and fast and I was shaking like hell, this lasted like 10 mins before it happened. First, the roof of my mouth went numb and the electric waves started again but much stronger and persistent, but only on my left side of the body, I started to panic, the guys left and it was just me and my brother in my rented apartment, I tried to sleep, but I felt my heart beat too loud, I tried to walk around the apartment but I felt like was gonna pass out, when I looked at myself in the mirror I was pale as a ghost, my lips where white as milk, I was convinced that it was my last day. I even felt like my heart had stopped a few times. To be clear, in the past I had a broken rib on the left side, near the heart zone, my heart was beating so strong that it broke it again... or I think that happened, idk but the next days that rib hurt just like after I broke it.

I struggled to calm down, but when I started co calm I was feeling that my heart is stopping and would go again. This hell lasted like 3 and a half hours before I called the emergency services and described a heart attack, they came, took my vitals, all was good, it turned out to be a acute enterocolitis and my body wasn't retaining nothing, but mentally I was a mess, I was almost screaming at them that I am dying why the fuck do they just sit there? It was the most traumatic experience of my life.

And here I am now after another 3 trips to the emergency room from the same symptoms, exactly one month off everything, I don't smoke nothing anymore (I was smoking cigs too), I don't drink any alcoholic or even fuzzy drink anymore, I don't drink coffe anymore, I even moved in with my parents again. And I still have some weird sensations in my body and anxiety that fucked up my stomach and social life. Tomorrow I finnally gonna see a cardiologist to make sure nothing is wrong and the day after I am going to a psychiatrist. Anyway, I am much better than I was physhically and the anxiety its almost gone, but man the dread I felt in the past month changed me forever... Sorry for the long post and for any mistakes on spelling or  grammar, english isn't my first language. I planned to share my story with you guys. It's my longest and most personal post on reddit till now.

On one hand I love it for I've always really been able to appreciate the high, and I've always felt like weed and me just click, you know? On the other hand I hate that it's such a big deal that I'm here writing this, and that it's so difficult to abstain totally.

I think I've been smoking regularly for like 5 years. I quit last fall, made it almost 4 months and I did feel sharper and I had past a lot of the withdrawals which I was happy about. However, I missed it. Even with being sharper etc. I couldnt shake the feeling that it's just what I wanted.. That it would help with my motivation for studying. That I should ""enjoy life and smoke up"". Perhaps unsurprisingly it was almost daily pretty quickly, and that's how it's been for around 5 months now. Sad to look at it now and say I've got almost nothing done study-wise. Even though during it all I felt like it wasn't because of the smoking, it seems too much of a coincidense doesn't it?

Ran out last week, and I've been tapering off with off days and veeeery minimal scraps. Technically this was day 1, but it's not entirely accurate. I didn't make a big quitting decision but now I feel like I should maybe just stick with it and not go buy more. Sobering up a little has made me read this sub again, which I found helpful when I was on my 4 month quit during the fall/winter. 

The conflict? I get more what I want to done sober, but with less enjoyment and I guess I have some strange anxiety issues, so it makes me wonder why struggle so much? When I smoke, I do enjoy myself but when thinking rationally it does make me more passive, which in my heart of hearts I dont want. I would like to have the best of both worlds, but I suppose it's not possible.

Thanks for reading. Would like to hear if this sparks any thoughts. I'm trying to really convince myself of the fact that weed is not something that will help my motivation/drive/performance. I tried that this spring, in reality it's been the same old same old. But now that I'm sober (even though still early/withdrawals), again it FEELS as if I'd get more motivated if I just smoked a little. How crazy am I?",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4926682}"

I can't live like this","Started the year great, first 6 months I smoked less than 10 times when I began to quit. I was feeling pretty good about my habits and sobriety, having gained clarity and being more social.

Then I slowly slipped and bought the first time in a long time. Just 0,5g, it can't be that bad?

That small amount lasted me a week, I did have a few days of break in there. Well then I bought a gram, thinking I needed it for some reason, and I've been doing so good, it's okay right?

Wrong, the cycle continued with another gram after that, 2g after that. Now I've pretty much smoked the whole month and I'm feeling more down than in a long time. Irritated while not high, disappointed when I get high, and coming down makes me want to smoke some more. Also got the problem of overeating unhealthy foods to the point where I feel sick next day. I also do not rest well when I sleep.

Idk how I ended up here again, but it doesn't feel like the place I want to be. I'm half-lying to myself cause of addiction, I don't want to smoke but I do... Everything's just f\*cked all of a sudden, I feel hopeless sometimes.

While sober I have trouble maintaining interest in things, just browsing youtube mindlessly searching for distraction. While high it's actually kinda the same, but I'll just feel more guilty at the same time.

I'm seriously angry for the situation I'm in. I can't believe I fooled myself thinking it was okay to smoke, only to end up in a pit of despair after idk, 4g's? Maybe it's hard to believe that relatively small amount gave me the opportunity to wreck my wellbeing. It's of course not just the weed, it's how I use it to avoid my emotions and deal with life in an unhealthy way.

Will I ever learn? I just can NOT buy some weed, enjoy it and leave it in a cupboard. Nah I'll be tempted af to smoke everyday, and I give in too easily, like I have no self-control or something.

If I'm honest, returning to smoking has made me mostly anxious and depressed. I've had short-lived good moments and felt like it's a spiritual experience from time to time, but in the end I received the short straw. I feel so conflicted about smoking, and none of the times I've smoked during the month have actually been ""worth it"", never completely. It's like maybe 30-60% positive usually, but in the end I tend to be more like a zombie everyday that goes by, and that justifies me to smoke again, to feel energetic for a moment, only to feel more tired the next day and as the tolerance rises, the enjoyment decreases and the emptiness inside grows.

Please don't relapse unthinkingly like I did. It only takes a little for your life to turn back into everyday smoking. I don't enjoy the apathy I'm experiencing, not one bit of it.

I'm starting to think weed doesn't have much to offer me anymore. I'll just end up regretting it at some point. Time to move on I guess. Pot holds me back from growing, and it makes me anxious and angry, that I'm even smoking it.

Bit of a ranty all-over-the-place post, but I just needed to let out some of this feeling. I've never said this, but I hate what my life becomes with mj, I actually HATE IT.

I'll try to make a sobriety post in the future when I get out of this hell I'm in.

Just wanted to post this here. A lot of my friends don’t understand how big of a deal this is for me but I know a lot of you do!
 I just want to let you know if your struggling with staying sober you are doing it right. The ability to stop something that makes you feel normal, numb and or “good” is one of the hardest things a person can do. 

When I quit I had lost my dad 10 months ago (09/07/19) (Took care of my declining father for 2 years at 20) I used weed to numb my pain. I was anxious, depressed and didn’t have anything going for me… it was pretty scary to face. I spent alot of the first 3 months crying and anxious went to MA meeting that helped a lot in the beginning. Between 3-6 months I started back to school to be a nurse. Still was anxious and went through huge dips of anxiety,depression and grief. ->Every time I came out the other side of an anxiety/depression/grief wave. I gained a better perspective that this pain is not going to last forever. <-
(This was the biggest help in growing my confidence in myself that I don’t need weed to numb me) “feelings are feelings and they won’t last forever” 

6 months to now. I became clear headed enough to realize I was dx with ADHD when I was 10 so I went back to the doctor got on meds and that has also been huge for me. Realized I was using weed to medicate my underlining mental health condition. Life has gotten better honestly never want to go back because the work to become who I am today is not something I wanna start again. 

I just want to say you can do it. It’s hard if your struggling then your doing it right. If you have smoked for a long time every feeling will feel new and scary once sober at least for me it did. Remember your feelings are valid and they will pass. Happy to answer questions y’all might have!

I perpetually have a problem sticking the landing. Weed has been the biggest struggle for me, worse than alcohol. I initially decided I should forever stop smoking as far back as 2015 - the problem has inconsistently plagued me since then, but more consistently in recent months. 

Typically I’ll go off for a few months after a short initial struggle, then somewhere down the line my willpower folds and I give into a moment of anxiety or excitement and set myself down the inevitable road again. 

For the past few months, this has become practically an every day or every-other-day process: Get excited to acquire weed and tell myself that this time I will behave differently around it; smoke and almost immediately regret it and fall down a hole of closed-eye binge-eating in my room; dispose of all my weed and paraphernalia the next day; binge-eat again to congratulate myself and “seal the deal”. A day or two later, I’ll conveniently forget about all this and restart the cycle.

I’ve put this addiction on my friends and even my younger brother - i.e., announce that I am addicted to weed and that I need to stop; get their support; gain initial comfort and self-assurance in the support; baffle everyone by starting all over again. 

Wash, rinse, repeat. Delta 8 has imploded the amount of difficulty I’m having pulling this off right now. I am trying to sort myself out and know my baseline again - THC doesn’t even make me feel happy any more. This is all just something I’ve become used to and I am so frustrated at myself for it and tired of it.

My last update included letting you all know how terrible night sweats were on the first night for me.. as well as the normal withdrawal symptoms. 

Last night was night 2 and while my boyfriend and I were both sweating, it wasn’t nearly as bad as the first night. We both changed shirts once throughout the night and we also started laying towels down under our shirts and let me tell you, that was amazing and left things much drier than before. I did turn throughout the night but I was able to get at least 3 hours in which is much better than the 45 minutes I banked on the first night. Honestly I really want to take a nap sometime today because im so tired but I feel like that’s going to make sleeping later tonight harder for me. Does anyone else get so much anxiety before bed? I understand why it happens but wow. My chest really feels like stacked bricks from anxiety every time we approach bed time. 

I woke up on day 3 feeling a little better. Body temperature regulation still sucks and the rollercoaster of hot and cold throughout the day is honestly one of the more irritating withdrawal effects. Also, eating still sucks. I’ve been making us try to eat something around mealtimes and if that doesn’t work, protein shakes and smoothies with crackers and bland soup really are the only things going down. (I tried to eat a scrambled egg earlier and it didn’t go so well) I’m excited for the days my fantastic appetite comes back. Until then, I make sure to take my vitamins and I drink plenty of water with at least one pedialyte running throughout the day. 

Exercise has been really difficult considering I’m used to working out heavy 5-6x a week normally. I worked out yesterday to get tired and honestly it was the slowest workout of my life.. but I’m going to try again today because I could use the endorphins. 

This time around I feel much more prepared handling these awful side effects..all I’m really trying to do is make this more tolerable to get through this first week hurdle. They being said. Im at the beginning of day 3 and I’ve already been hot and cold more times than Katy perry mentions that in her song. Still pushing through though! I know things will get better!

Had a lot of “issues” with alcohol and decided I needed to give it up and quit drinking in 2007.  I also needed to stop smoking at that time due to legal issues.  During that break I realized weed wasn’t the greatest thing for me anymore. Think I quit for 1.5yrs however once my legal issues were behind me I convinced myself I could smoke again because it’s only weed and I didn’t do anything stupid when I was stones…alcohol was what got me into trouble.  I hid my use from my recovery friends and knew deep down I shouldn’t be smoking but the addict in me won.  I thought as long as I wasn’t getting into trouble I was fine.

I hid my usage from my girlfriend (now wife).  She didn’t like how much I smoked so I did it behind her back and lied to her face whenever she called me out or caught me. Weed has been a major issue throughout our relationship and I carried HUGE resentments against her for trying to control me, and honestly I think that led me to want to smoke more.  I’ve always had trouble with sleeping about 2 yrs ago she gave in and said I could smoke every night to help me sleep instead of taking all the medication I was on even though I had been secretly smoking almost every night anyway. 

So I finally got what I wanted and been smoking nightly for about 2 years. We have 3 kids 5,3,4mo.  I noticed I’d rush at bedtime so I could go do my thing.  I’d stay up late and binge eat crappy food and feel it the next day…. And then do the same thing again. Over the past 6mo I’ve really not been enjoying this cycle and felt I’ve been wasting my time, energy, and life around getting high.

(coming up on 8 years of abusing this drug, 26 now). But I feel good enough to share that I've successfully gone 14 days since last using. I believe this is the first time I've made it that far since graduating college in 2017!

Since becoming legal in CA, I've been hooked on vape pens. Disposable ones, like draining the bank account quick ones. I've even been thinking about celebrating today's accomplishment with a ""reward,"" but I've tried that in the past too many times just to end up in the same place I started. I'm honestly repulsed by that idea at the moment.

A couple thoughts that have helped:

\- Keeping yourself busy / in spaces with good friends and influences help tremendously. I finally told my mom after keeping this behavior a secret for over 7 years. I also spent the last week with my best friend who doesn't use any vices. I've just found that staying stuck by yourself, in your room, is only gonna fuel your eventual need for that ""boredom supplement."" You really do need to make active changes in your life / routine if you hope to find long-term success, doing that in tandem with sobriety makes the process feel much less intense.

\- As cliche as it is: Taking things one day at a time. Really, don't put so much pressure on yourself for ""failing"" to meet checkpoints or slipping up. We're human dammit, and particularly if you're using a tracker app it can feel profoundly defeating to make it a certain number of days only to be forced back to ""square one""/day zero. But those clean days absolutely count for something, and they add up - they should serve as a reminder that you are on the right path and you're making the right choices for yourself.

To top it off on my way home from work today I stopped at my mums house to grab some bits and noticed one of my draws stunk of weed, there was a grinder with a pretty decent joint in there, I stared at it for 10 mins, rolled it, put it in a pot in case of emergency and then again went on to roll and have a fag instead, this was over an hour ago, knowing I've got a joint in my bag is hard but I'm so impressed that I didn't just roll it and go out and smoke it in an instant.

I really hope I don't give into it, it's going to be a hard battle but one that's worth it.

With the stop and go time periods so short now, it is just astonishing how clear everything is to me now. I love sobriety and have actually grown to hate weed, but yet.... here I am. 

When i am sober, I wake up early, eat well, check things off my to do list, answer the phone when people call me. I am just a regular, normal person living life. When I am smoking- I am either 1. in bed all day trying to find a show to binge, or 2. out doing things that I think sound fun to do high- but never are, bc nothing is easy when I am high. I can't find my keys, i can't find my phone, where did i put that pen? The most mundane tasks seem to take forever, and by the time i find my phone and am ready to leave, i think ""i should just smoke again."" 

When I smoke, I am stupid, I feel stupid. I forget everything in the middle of talking, i start sentences I have no idea where they are going. Once I smoke enough I start to crave alcohol (another vice i am trying to give up), and eat crappy foods. I also hang out with friends who smoke, and am growing to realize- maybe i don't even like these friends but for the weed.

I wanted to reach out to those still struggling to quit, I'm not saying a I won't trip, but I am saying I won't fall (MacMiller). It took multiple times to finally to reach this milestone (approaching 40days) I don't want to call them failures because I learned from each of them that I wanted to quit more and more, smoked for about 10 years after graduating HS never wanting to acknowledge I had a problem, but I started to become numb to life and life events like deaths and family reunions things that one must face and feel the emotions both good and bad ones. I'll be 30 this December looking back I don't regret what I did because I had to go there to get here, 2020 was the year I realized I had a problem, I felt like I was never present (still don't at times) but I must now create new experiences to feel emotions and new memories, I stumbled across this community in a video about quitting about 3 years ago and I found a safe place to know I wasn't alone in what became of me mentally and physically. I get happy seeing these milestones hit from some of you and the relapses too that reinforced that ""we can do this attitude"" now I dream so much more and am closer to my brothers and family than ever before, I had to learn to say no to some ""friends"" distancing myself to focus on myself. It's tough but that's life we just have to assign it a reason to push through. I don't feel like I'm clean just yet because I was a heavy smoker mainly Dabs, but I am looking forward to seeing a clean drug test that I plan on taking around December it's gonna be the first clean test in years. Sorry if I'm all over the place with this post, but I hope this community find it helpful, don't beat yourself up so much you're all you got at the end of the day and we all have demons that one must suppress, these mental battles must be won. Dominate yourself.

It smells great and horrible at the same time.  I have a very small, very quiet demon that understands I could find it and ask for a toke, but I have a very loud foundation that is called “play the tape all the way through” and I know where I will end up.  It’s not a lie, I will stop showing up for work, I will blame everyone around me for getting in the way and I will not leave my house, nay, bedroom until the stash is gone and I’m out looking for more.

I reflect often on the psychosis I was having for years.  The revelations, the metaphors and analogies, the delusions of grandeur.  I was so moved by the spirit so much I tried to join a church.  I had new an amazing revelations about spirituality.  That was an embarrassing journey.

I’ll be honest.  I permanently hurt my brain.  Specifically the reward system of my brain has definitely been damaged.  Pleasure and reward doesn’t come like it used to, like that satisfying feeling of a job well done.  So, my motivation is gone and it takes anxiety to get me working, not a satisfying sense of a job well done.  It’s not totally gone, but it’s very diminished.   It’s tough going through life without a healthy reward system.  It’s laziness and anxiety and depression.   I’m medicated for it.  I’m so glad I was pushed into therapy by my now wife and was diagnosed with depression.  This was when I had about 3 years clean.  

I have found mindfulness one of the only ways to get the joy of life back.  I was just at the water park with my son today.  If I didn’t really pay attention to what was happening in the moment and how special it is to swim and play and experience with my 5-year-old son, I naturally find myself just ‘existing’.   My normal state is like a goth - all intellectual and very articulate about how everything around me is fake and pedestrian.  I had dippin’ dots today for the first time and waxed poetic about how inferior they are to real ice cream.  I sincerely apologized to my son for this.

But I can honestly say I’m GRATEFUL to be sober.  It took some time to get there, like 2 years or more.  

I did it through MA, AA and NA.  I got tons of good tools through that program and some great sober parties to be totally awkward at for the first few months.   But full of awesome people who were also awkward at their first sober party and totally understood.  I needed this in a bad way.   Now I actually feel uncomfortable jamming with musicians who are drinking and smoking.   It doesn’t feel normal anymore.  It’s not a show stopper tho.

I refuse to be a whiny bitch, so I’m constantly looking for solutions to be happy and fulfilled in life.  Just like someone who lost their legs, I’ll never run again, but I can sure move fast enough with my meds and my positive attitude.  It just takes a bit more effort to feel joy.  It doesn’t come as easily as it did when all it took was a few bong hits to feel fulfilled in life.

Tomorrow I go back to work.   I must keep in mind that I will indeed feel good about myself if I work well and accomplish more than just laying on the couch browsing Reddit.

EDIT;  I made a stupid dumb amateur mistake at work on Friday and just found out today.  A coworker had to point it out to me b/c I couldn’t find it myself.  I feel extremely embarrassed and the imposter syndrome has flared.  Parts of my unhelpful committee in my head are telling me I’m going to be fired for incompetence.   I didn’t break anything or lose money, just time and a slipping schedule on a project I feel is already late.  No one has told me flat out that it’s taking too long.  I just feel it.  I wanted a sense of accomplishment today and got this instead.

I’ve posted a few times here and am wondering what some of the longer cannabis users who stopped experiences were : how long did it take to feel consistently better from not ingesting cannabis? I smoked for the better part of 14 years, and have abstained pretty much for 3 months. I have seen massive improvement in many areas of my life, but realize there are some aspects that I think may improve gradually as I continue to be on the sobriety path. I’m 31, almost 32 in a few weeks, so I recognize this is a massive shift for me and will take time. I am willing to be patient. Specifically I feel like my sleep has been really messed up from cannabis consumption. I have a hard time waking up, and sleep incredibly deeply with vivid dreams for a few months now. Doesn’t seem to be waning either. I don’t know how sustainable it is to have to sleep 10+ hours a night as I’m incredibly busy. That’s just one of the changes I have noticed. Another is my reward pathway. I feel like I don’t understand what things I should look forward to anymore. Used to just be excited to come home and get blazed and do fuck all.

Habits are hard to kick, especially when they are associated with a positive response. Smoking cigs provides comfort/relief, pot brings the high, relaxation, separation from reality ect ect. Habits are also born from negative associations usually creating an avoidance of whatever causes these negative feelings. 

With all that said I'm happy report that had an experience (2 in fact) that switched how i feel about smoking pot. At this point iv been 3 weeks pot free. 

Long story short my partners cousins came 4 hours to hang out for the evening. They're around our age 29 so we were looking forward to an evening of drinks and good conversation. I knew they smoked so i picked up some pre rolls with the idea of ""enhancing"" the evening. Well they showed up conversation was great and we started to get a couple of drinks into us. One of the cousins asked if we could light up a joint. It was only us two for the first round and we didn't smoke very much but right away the vibe changed. Conversation was more difficult, i found it much harder to be my usual animated self and i felt it was more difficult to find my words and ended up dumbling me down. I found myself withdrawing from conversation and became more of an observer than a participant. The cousin that smoked with me seemed to be feeling the same. When my partner asked how he was doing he mentioned he was hanging on by a thread, he was completely overwhelmed and retired not long after. 

So weed turned a fun energetic evening into a struggle for us both. We haven't seen them in almost two years so it was very disappointing to have it stunted and cut short. 

The next day after everyone left i was incredibly hung over. Thinking it would help (I'm not smart) i smoked the rest and was literally a zombie all day. I played videogames and before i knew it the day was over and i hadnt had a single meaningful conversation with my partner all day. I felt disconnected and weighed down. It made me think of how many days iv spent in a similar stupor. How many days have just flown by without anything meaningful? Its created huge gaps in my memory.. I thought ""i just have a bad memory"" but the truth is i was so blazed that i didn't do anything to create memories in the first place. After 15  years of this i have huge gaps of time i can hardly recall... I'm done wasting my precious life being in a partial coma of my own making.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46092367}"

I was really down the drain for a few months and weed was the only solace through it. Now I am with a different girl and I see weed doing its thing again.

And now, I am at a point where weed doesn't even make me feel good. Just normal. 

Anyway, so I have been thinking about quitting for a long time now. Joined this group for all the motivation. I recently switched to a new job and tommorow is my first day. I really need to dedicate time for this job as it is requires me to learn a lot. I finished my last stock of weed yesterday and the only way I could possibly go without smoking is by not having any with me. So I won't score anymore. 

I have an anxiety about it, that all the burried sorrow is going to slowly creep out . That I will have trouble sleeping and life will feel very dull.. 

But it's about time I do this. My support is this group and all the kind well-meaning people who are in the same boat as me. Thank you all and wish me luck. Together we can.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63444054}"

I've been dabbing multiple times a day every day for the past two and a half years. I recently made the decision to quit, as I'm about to be leaving the city I've been living in for the past six years and figured it would be a good time for a change.

Since quitting, I've been having awful withdrawals unlike anything I've ever experienced. The closest thing I can relate my mental state to is almost like lightly tripping. While the mental stuff seems like it's starting to get a tiny bit better today, the physical side of things keeps getting worse. I've been having cold sweats, hot flashes, insane nausea, and can hardly get myself to eat anything. One of the main reasons I started smoking in the first place was because of my chronic insomnia--a problem I haven't really had to deal with now for years. Since making the decision to quit, the first few nights I smoked the tiniest amount possible, once right before going to bed. This allowed me to fall asleep slightly more easily, but not stay asleep for the entire night. I was only smoking enough to help with the symptoms and going to sleep, but not even close to enough to get me stoned. I did not smoke last night and didn't sleep a wink, and do not want to keep smoking (even if it's the smallest amount) to fall asleep. I'm wondering if this was making the withdrawals worse, or if this method of tapering helps in the longer run, given that I've been dabbing about a dozen times a day for over past 2 years? Obviously it's different for everyone.

I turned to weed for the reasons above. I can't sleep or function or socialize without it. 

Quitting is so hard and it is especially hard to be sober while the pandemic is happening and my country is also far off from normalcy. 

I'm on day 3. And honestly, going into this I was just thinking of taking a tolerance break, but now going through these withdrawals and reading about it, I've decided to fully abstain.

My reason for quitting are the ff:
- to help my mental health
- I love my sanity more than being high
- because it has also consumed me financially and now I'm so deep in debt
- its withdrawals effect is scary and what used to make me happy is now making me miserable
- I've been using it as my crutch

All of these has made me realize that I am addicted to it and the addiction has to go. 

But at the same time it's so easy to just go back to buying another cart.

I don't know how you guys get through this.

My depression and anxiety has gone through the roof. I can't sleep. I have no will to do things in general. I have cold sweats and I'm just angry and irritable all the time. 

Weed is still illegal here and so bud has been really hard to access so I've just been using carts and dab pens which is why I feel like the withdrawals are much worse.

Generally - it's just a vicious cycle. 

I feel worse because my mental health is worse. My mental health is worse because I feel worse. Put that on loop, on repeat x100

I was mostly alone and didnt have to justify myself to anyone.

One of the main reasons I was able to quit drinking, was because I had cannabis to help me past the worst cravings.  

Now... With my new found sobriety from alcohol, I want a better life, a better job, specifically I am planning to join a trade union, and I want to do it right.  In order to action that plan, I need to quit smoking.

But also, as amazing as it is to be alcohol free for(almost) a year, I shouldn't lie to myself, I havent been truly sober in probably close to 20 years.  Sure there were some dry spells in those years, but I was always looking or waiting those out.

Now, Ive been plannimg to quit for a couple weeks, but its always tomorrow, and never today.  I am scared of what will happen to my sleep. And I'm also scared about my eating habits, long ago as a teen, I didnt really eat much, diagnosed with IBS, but when I started smoking I started to enjoy food too.

Earlier this year I started to feel chest pain, stomach pain, and neck/ throat discomfort. I went to the ER and got x rays done and blood tested. Everything was fine. Lungs sounded good which is shocking considering how much I’ve smoked. Stomach pain was just because I was eating a lot of greasy foods during that time, but pain was amplified because it was all anxiety. 


I came to the conclusion that I was highly addicted to smoking weed. There would be days where I would throw away my pods and next day getting them back by asking for money. Shit is tough when it comes to addiction. It led to anger and anxiety issues which I never had before I started smoking weed.

I've been a long time lurker on the sub, and I can't tell you how much it's helped me through my journey. 
I started smoking every single day about 5 years ago and I loved it, it made me feel amazing. About a year ago that feeling went away, and when I smoked I would have increased anxiety and a strong urge to quit. I have a plethora of mental health problems, and unfortunately the weed was making them worse.. Over the past 6 months I've quit twice and given into temptation no more than a month in, despite the overwhelming guilt I would feel when I did.
In March I was able to stop until sometime in April, then I picked it back up. I wasn't smoking heavily, it would take me 2 to 3 days to finish a blunt but I'd have a hit or 2 every few hours so that I was high all day everyday. 
June 12th I had my last hit and tonight I passed my first at home test. Seeing those 2 lines took away every bit of craving I had, and I still can't believe it. Knowing that I'll finally be able to get a good job and just be able to pee in a cup with no issues is a huge weight off my shoulders.

I was never a smoke up before work kind of person. I would always burn out a couple hours into my shift, and getting away on a lunch break to re-up my high was always more of a hassle than anything. So I would always smoke up after work, it was the very first thing I went to when I got home. From 2017-2019, I would even load my pipe and leave it out in the backyard shed so I wouldn't have to go inside before toking up! I didn't want to see or talk to anyone, all I wanted to do was get high by myself and sit outside scrolling my phone for up to an hour some days. Any break from this routine and I was crabby, shitty, bitchy and overall a miserable sack of shit to be around.

My misery, anxiety, and frustration with the way my life was going reached a breaking point around May long weekend 2019. I took a sabbatical from my job for a month to take care of my mental health. I realized with my previous experience with quitting other substances, and with my need for a structured daily routine, this would be my best shot at quitting cannabis altogether. So about 5 days into my break, I gave it up cold turkey. I used supplements for about six months throughout the day for anxiety. I still use them to this day for sleep, but that has more to do with working graveyard shifts now than anything. During that month off, I reevaluated my work and decided I wanted a change. I took care of myself and found joy in other things, even if it was just playing video games or watching pro wrestling like I did when I was younger. I kept busy by working out, eating right, temporarily giving up caffeine and cutting out sugar completely. And I went back to work completely reinvigorated and I've been clean ever since with very little desire to go back to the way things were.

TLDR, it was very hard, since I'm a routine oriented person, to quit when I was in the middle of a work week grind. Taking some time for myself, doing things that made me happy and eating and living healthier without the pressure of responsibilities made giving up my addiction of 10 and a half years much easier.",33,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45436278}"
2021-07-04 23:12:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/odynkd/4_day_beleaver/,4 Day be-Leaver,"Hello all you beautiful be-leavers,

Started smoking 10 years ago but kept it limited to the weekends. It was incredible because I got hella stoned each time I smoked: the giddy, giggly, great high of new smokers. 5 years ago I returned from an awesome vacation and was confronted with the fact my life wasn't what I wanted it to be. I began smoking more and more until it got to be a daily habit just to numb myself. In tandem with/because of the weed I began to eat more and more food that was less and less good for me and stopped going to the gym.

Now it's gotten to the point where ""getting high"" doesn't actually get me high. And now I'm fat. I've tried to stop several times. Recently I made it 10 days smoke free after 4/20. I caved and told myself I'd only smoke 2 pre-rolls. That wasn't the case.

June 30, 2021 was the last day I smoked. I took the 4 day long weekend (Canadian eh) to jumpstart my detox. I knew from previous attempts sleep would be an issue, so I wanted a stretch of no work commitments so I could sleep when I was tired and stay up when I wasn't. What did I do? Not much of anything. I laid in bed and watched Netflix, browsed Reddit, and generally did what my life had become with weed, just without smoking.

The thing I'll miss the most? The creative inspiration/the perspective getting high gave me. It only ever happened after I had taken several days off weed and then only the first time I went back to smoking. The next day or so when I'd smoke again it was right back to feeling nothing. But genuinely getting high gave me the perspective to see things I couldn't normally see.

I'm in a creative field, so getting high and having a breakthrough felt awesome. And even getting high and having the perspective to self reflect (e.g. I've been treating so-and-so unfairly or I never thought of this situation from that perspective before) felt awesome. **My question to all you beautiful souls fighting the good fight:** what do you do to take yourself out of your own headspace, to give yourself that distance and perspective that getting f\*ed up used to give us?

My advice to anyone who's read all of this: don't give up! No matter where you are on your journey keep progressing forward. Setbacks are normal, but giving in is never going to feel as good as you think it will, and your happiness is worth more than a dose of herbal novocaine.

2021-07-04 22:32:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ody3s8/july_4th_day_4/,July 4th day 4," I've quit weed again after 9 months just disappeared in the field of green. I went a year without weed before going back. It just seemed so brutal not having anything to change my state of mind once in awhile (and secretly I missed the rebelious, skin of my teeth, crazy shit I did while high too).

   Ok I will be honest again. That year I was sober was very eventful and productive compared to the nine months I was back on the weed again. In those nine months I went back to daily use but I didn't always lose control and I took tolerance breaks. Things were different that go around with the green bitch because weed had been legalized.

 There is a drastic contrast in time perception between sobriety and active use. I feel like sobriety is a much a faster energy than weed energy. I had positive things happening for me rapidly when sober and I just accomplished a lot more overall. This has a perceptual effect of making sober time seem longer in retrospect. Or should I say; time isn't just burning away when I'm sober.
 
 Sure enough, in the last few months of using, those negative voices in my head started coming back. Those psychotic auditory disturbances began re-emerging as well, oh and the shadows, and those darting black things in my peripheral vision. Weird, I thought I was over the anxiety after smoking but that seems to be returning sometimes too. I could ignore the creepshow for a while but what's worse was I could feel the weed chipping away at the self confidence I had gained during sobriety. I started having those depresso thoughts like; I will just smoke weed because I will never have another LTR again anyway,  you have no friends that want you around, your work is worthless, you can't off yourself, so at least it is fun being stoned when your lonely until it's not and your a full blown addict again so....

So I just recently got back onto Reddit, almost solely for this sub because I'm trying to quit smoking weed. If you go back in my account you can see that I was successful for about 4 months last year, but I fell back into about a year ago now.

This past year has been a haze and has flown by so fast, which happens whenever I stay high half of the day. I'm feeling unmotivated to do the things I love, so I know that it's time to quit for good, at least for a long while.

I have a lot of motivation to quit smoking, mostly because it costs me a bit of money (prolly $20-40 per week, which isn't bad but I could use it for much more productive things) and I know I will be much more motivated to get on my grind and make some money.

So, if anyone has any tips on how to overcome cravings when they come up they would be much appreciated 🙏💚

In the last year and a half, basically since the beginning of the pandemic I’ve been smoking non stop and have spent thousands. But even before that, I’ve been a regular smoker for well over 10 years. I have no clue who I even am anymore, all my joy for life has all but gone and the only thing I look forward too is being high to drown out the ‘monotony’ of every day life at the end of the day. Ive given up on friendships, lost interest in hobbies and the outdoors. Ive gotten 2 warnings in my job in the last 3 months for making repeated mistakes, simple things that i know the brain fog from weed is causing me to do, which is a pretty good job, good pay and easy too do, yet I’ve managed to become so detached from the routine of it, I’d just rather smoke and drop out of it all instead.

I like weed, but I recognise it’s taken a hold over me now and it’s made me miserable, or maybe I’m just miserable anyway and the weed is exasperating those feelings even further.

In the last week I’ve made 2 mistakes that are very unlike me, but I ran out of contacts and turned to Snapchat and got robbed not once but twice, ordering bags while high and then realising I’d been scammed. I feel so fucking stupid because the logical side of me is like, this isn’t you, the old you never would have fallen for that, how have you become this desperate to make such stupid mistakes. 

Anyway, I dunno what to do, this is my day one. Ive thrown out all my smoking paraphernalia and gotten rid of any number I know I might contact when I get the urge but I’m just terrified of what will come next.

Long story short context : am 27, started smoking at 12, 17 days sober now.

- I still feel as if sometimes my body get me high (or something like that) on its own, as if all the storage is slowly emptying itself. Is it normal and how long might this last ? (Stopped for a few months a few years ago, and still felt that, though a bit less).
- my sense of self feels really weird (like I lost an arm or something). Is it common, and how does it evolve through time ? What can I do to ""reaffirm"" my sense of self ?
- I keep drinking so much water yet feel dehydrated, especially at night. (Maybe from the cold sweats of nightmares ?). 
- I red some psychological studies that all seem inconclusive on the long term effect of cannabis when used during teenage years. Some people who smoked heavily as teenagers and quit for years can share their insights on this please ? 🙏

-- 
Long context :
I started at 12 when my brother (then 17) called me to his room to help him cut his plant and dry it, a few weeks later, I smoked for the first time. 
Smoked every once in a while, and at 14, started smoking daily. 
My brother killed himself 4 years ago, after diagnosis of schizophrenic paranoid (a few months before his suicide, after, almost killing my father and breaking his knee : the argument started about weed consumption. (Even I saw he was so different when he smoked and wanted him to stop, though felt my consumption was under control)).

In those four years, my view on weed has changed back and forth from ""it's helping me and is magical"" to ""it's the root of all wrong in my life"".
In those four years the desire to quit grew, quit a few times, found so many excuses to continue.

During the first confinement, I was at my parents place, near a forest etc, I quit both weed and cigarettes, went running everyday, had no stress whatsoever, and it was ""easy"". (The craving was for nicotine, not weed).
As soon as I got back to my ""real life"" I started smoking again.
Prior to quitting now (like in those past few months) my consumption was a steady 20g/week, smoking was the first thing I did as I woke up and the last thing before going to sleep, thinking it helped with depression and anxiety, hardly pondering if it might be the cause of it. (Or avoiding the question everytime it popped in my mind).

I stopped when I went to visit my parents, as I didn't have any. 
This time I feel it's different as my desire to quit feels .. so obvious., like I just needed some ""inertia"" to stop.
When I got back to my place 10 days ago, the weed was on the table, and I was exhausted and wanted to smoke so much. 
Then I thought ""then what ? If I smoke now, I know I'll smoke tomorrow morning and back to it. And when will be the next ""inertia"" to stop ?""
I put the box aside, and went for a walk, came back home and slept.
I have now given all my smoking gear and the weed I had left to a friend, and feel like this is truly a new chapter starting. 

I view it as saying goodbye to an old friend, that may have been a foe in disguise in my case.

In some way I feel sad knowing (thinking?) That I won't be able to smoke every once in a while, as I have to realise every time I smoked again after a break, habits came back rushing.
Sad because I hoped I could handle this as I managed my drinking problem, but feel like I won't.
(Was once at 1 bottle of gin a day + all the rest, and can now have a drink socially every once in a while without wanting more).
Maybe because my alcoholic phase was short lived (about a year), and cannabis has permeated through my life.

In some ways, it's also saying goodbye to one of my many selves.

I’m 18 years old turning 19 in 2 weeks. I’ve been vaping for almost exactly 3 years now, and have been going through a cart a week for the past 10 months.

I’ve quit nicotine for 10 days last month but gave in because of the cravings. With Nicotine I didn’t have any withdrawls except for cravings which started around day 9. I used a 5ml 50mg disposable every week. 

Carts on the other hand are something else. I’ve taken 2 tolerance breaks before and they were terrible. The carts were 98% THC. Withdrawls included depression, suicidal thoughts, boredom, trouble sleeping, waking up sweating at night, and I kept picking a fight with everyone I know, lost a couple of friends during withdrawals.

Yesterday (Day 1) was very easy, nothing was different for me. I went to sleep at 11:30 feeling very tired from work, but ended up waking up at 5:00 AM freezing cold, and covered in sweat. For some reason I still don’t get any dreams at all. Anyways, I was 100% expecting this to happen. Other else than that I feel a slight change in my head right now. Like a small fog in my head I guess? I’ve had no cravings from nicotine, in fact I can already feel the benifets from quitting that I felt last time, I can breathe from my nose again, I can take a full breath with my lungs, and the weird shaking anxiety and paranoia shit I had is gone too

I’ve never tried to quit carts, I’ve only taken tolerance breaks so I’m hoping its easier this time because I have willpower but I’m still expecting and ready for the nightmarish withdrawls tommorow or after tommorow.

I can’t let a cart decide when I’m happy and when I’m not!",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4957966}"

* Pacing around my room at night trying to burp myself like a baby because i drank some sips of tea
* Crying and sweating while I'm lying awake unable to sleep or calm down 
* Crawling around on my floor, on the porch, looking for little scraps like a beggar
* Sneaking into my brother’s room and stealing little scraps from him. A week after apologizing and crying for doing the same thing. FUCK I hate that I did that.
* Sneaking off in the middle of the night/early morning/wherever to smoke secretly out of an apple with a fucking candle??? Like that’s not insane behavior??? Hiding from my family and doing drugs off in the woods alone, not even having fun, just trying to stave off a panic attack?
* The compulsion. ***I hate being compelled.***
* *The money.* I don't even want to add it all up. I'll cry. 
* Letting my sewing machine gather dust on my desk, after all the plans I made to sew. 
* Letting my zines sit unmailed all summer, after all the plans I made to share my poetry.
* Not ever finishing that painting I promised my mom I'd paint her for Christmas, 'cause I got high all holiday break instead 
* Calling my friends up to hang out just to smoke their weed and half-lying to myself about it
* The fact that I barfed banana on myself in January and pineapple in June, *why didn't I learn?* 
* Seeing the girl I used to be in love with for the first time in a year, going to an ART MUSEUM for the first time in a YEAR, and not remembering anything because I had to take anxiety meds and smoke in the bathroom before we left. In 2020 I would've killed someone for that experience, and ***I don't remember it.***
* The brief moment, standing out in the yard on my way home to smoke and convince myself it’s because it’s fun and not because I’m scared of what my body will do when I finally stop, when I think with perfect clarity: *this is bad for me.* And then I put the thought off and get high, and I feel better. Until it wears off. Then I need more. And I get more desperate, because I hate withdrawals, and they terrify me.
* Are you doing this because you like it or *because you have to do it to feel okay? It always starts as the first and becomes the latter. All roads lead to Rome.*

I’ve done the dramatic, cathartic, “throw my paraphernalia in the garbage and say, I’m not doing this shit anymore” scene two or three times at this point. But then when I’m around my friends who smoked, when they would casually offer me a joint or an edible, I‘d cave each time. I thought I’d be stronger than that. Maybe those stupid DARE officers from elementary school had a point about peer pressure {sorry, Officer Hernandez, I’m sure you’re disappointed in me :-)}. But I’m not stronger than that. The only way I’ve been able to stay clean is by never having cannabis around me at all.

I bought a house a little under a year ago, and the friend who’s living with me has also had problems with weed and is trying to quit. We wrote it into our lease agreement that there would be no drugs in the house, and we’ve kept each other to that. I don’t see my stoner friends anymore. I don’t go to parties where I know there’ll be weed. I don’t have any dealer’s numbers in my phone anymore. I can’t trust my own willpower, so I’m building my life so I never have the option to say yes.

A year ago today, a friend of mine came over to my apartment. They were already a bit stoned. I don’t think I had told them I’d been trying to quit. Or maybe I had, but they’d forgotten. They offered me an edible, and I said yes, because I always said yes. A family on my block is very into illegal fireworks, and every year they get boxes and boxes and boxes of them (at least a thousand dollars worth, it’s wild), and set them off one after another for hours. And we, stoned, watched this amateur fireworks show, and held hands, and I thought “This is lovely, and I’m pissed with myself. This is a good farewell to this drug. I’m disappointed I relapsed. But if I never touch this drug again, I’ll have this memory of a beautiful final night with it.” It felt exactly like a bittersweet farewell with a (somewhat toxic) lover before I moved away across the ocean, never to see him again. It was at least good to say goodbye.

I was able to get over the food and insomnia. But these past couple of days i am mentally messed up. I started getting severe anxiety and I am getting a panic attack everyday for the past 4 days. I talked to a psychologist for help because I feel like this is way more than thc withdrawal. I definitely had anxiety before this, but smoking a joint would put a bandaid on it. Luckily I am home and with very supportive parents, but it’s at the point where I can’t even think anymore. It’s a constant feeling of when is my next panic attack going to happen. It’s easy for people to say just don’t think about it, But when you’ve been using weed for so long to run away from your problems, it is hard to think about anything else except what’s going to happened next.

Since, the past three years I have kicked every opportunity that has come my way, socially, professionally or in any other manner. All the love, all the obsession I have had, is for weed perhaps. Had anyone told me three years ago I would be here today writing this post, I would've laughed my ass off. A top of the class, academically brilliant high school student like myself being an addict? No way! But I guess this vanity was what didn't allow me to question my choices when I got so crazily into chasing the momentary high. 3 years later, cut to the present, I'm miserable in every sense. I smoke up everyday chasing the high, only to not even like it. The anxiety each time of what a failure it has made me doesn't even let me enjoy the high anymore. Still, I do it. Because, when I see that joint lit in front of me, everything else feel worthless, as if the puff is the only thing that can give me bliss. On retrospect I realise, I'm so wrong, every fucking time. My love for marijuana has helped me made friends. However, it's also such a weird feeling to know that all of your social life is built around a substance. How do I let go of this substance that now defines every part of my social life?

However, I've decided I am done now. I can't live a life of regret just because I could not let my urge for that momentary bliss in check. I don't wanna live in the guilt of missed opportunities. I wanna be the best version of myself, the 100% of what I CAN BE, and I WILL NOT LET MARIJUANA COME IN MY WAY FROM THIS DAY ONWARDS. 

So, this is my Day 1 and for starters, for the first time ever I refused to smoke a joint when my friend offered me a drag. It was hard but it was a good day in retrospect. My friends smoked, I still had fun, just not high. I really really hope I am able to continue this.  Hoping for the support of this wonderful community!

This is where it gets tricky: I haven't experienced a negative consequence from my drug use, aside from my own preoccupation with using and rituals.  I was accepted into graduate school, I have a good job, friends, etc. I made the dean's list all whilst smoking on the daily. I was tricking my brain into thinking that weed had enhanced my ability to cope with stressors and that it would be OK to use in a balanced way (after hours, for example).  The problem is, once 3-4 pm hit, I could not stop smoking all night. My pdoc will drop me if I don't make a real effort to quit, so here I am, attempting to quit for the first time in years. The last time I went 24 hours without smoking was Christmas overnight at my ex-bf's parents in 2019. My internal narrative is very negative due to years of abuse (I have C-PTSD) and my core belief screams at me that ""I can't"" succeed at anything, all the time, even if there is evidence to show that I have been successful.

I found myself awake after sleeping  only 3 hours, so I find myself here, looking to firm my resolve against  the desire to take up the herb again.  
My weed story is a bit odd I  feel. I started smoking when I was 21 after leaving the cult I grew up  in (LDS church) and just stopped this year at 29 after becoming a heavy  daily smoker over those 8 years, with my heaviest smoking starting  during the pandemic. The thing is, I know I need to let my body have  time to ""normalize"", but before weed, I did not experience much  happiness. I was depressed and angry pretty much my whole life. I had  this idea that weed ""taught my brain"" to experience happiness. Like I  was never really able to enjoy a moment beforehand and so weed opened up  the neural pathways in my brain for me to experience the enjoyment of  life. Yes I had moments of happiness in my life before weed, but truly  (not to sound too dramatic) most every day of my life was pretty  miserable from adolescents onward. I did not have a good time with life.  I've learned a lot of coping skills, so I'm not as  bad as I was before I started smoking/left the church. But it is still a  challenge. The thought that gets to me is, ""Was I ever really satisfied  with life before weed"", given I was mostly depressed and hating life  before.

  
I exercise with weights 6 days a week, I eat a very healthy  diet (plant based keto diet, yes I'm getting all the vitamins and  nutrients I need), I go hiking several times a week, I meditate every day. Still I find myself  craving weed regularly, and having trouble getting a good nights rest.  I've also stopped spending time with the only friends I really have that  live near me, as they smoke a lot, but really I stopped hanging out  with them because I realized all they ever do is complain about anything  and everything, and I don't want that in my life. I do feel isolated  and lonely, which I know does not help with addictions.  
I'm just going, day by day, holding onto faith that I might start to feel ""good"" without weed.

As good as my intentions are when I smoke, I invariably end up overeating/making poor food choices, eating late at night, and feeling like dogshit the next day as a result.

If I can give any advice to my anxious/depressed people who are still early in this fight, it’s that it tooooootally gets better. There’s only one catch and that is you have to be willing to suffer a little bit and actually do the work. You won’t just become a happy go lucky person who makes life your bitch just because you quit pot. Quitting pot is simply the beginning. Do things you love, find new things to love, make peace with things you can’t change. Really work on yourself besides just quitting.

Deciding to post now as something to keep me occupied and try to take stock of where I’m at.

I’ve smoked a lot for about a decade but since the pandemic and not being in an office my usage sky rocketed. It used to be every evening, now all day every day to the point where I couldn’t get high any more. I was smoking just to even out. I lost most of my social interest (despite having a wonderful group of friends) - whenever I am out I’m counting down the minutes until I can go home to smoke. Very few of my close friends do.

I started dating someone and noticed that if I stayed at their house and didn’t get high for 24 hours I’d have insane hot flashes, wake up drenched in sweat, become so irritable… not so chic.

I’m currently alone in a one week travel quarantine for a work trip and am at the end of my 6th day. There is no way I would have been able to do this without these set of circumstances but it’s maddeningly lonely. I really want to kick it for good this time - I managed about 6 weeks last year before falling right back into old habits - I know my willpower is paper thin. I worry that when I arrive back home I will fall at the first hurdle (the weed still in my flat).

I feel pretty horrendous still, anxious, restless, hot flashes, unable to concentrate unless I’m spiralling and focusing on something I shouldn’t be worrying about, no appetite, no energy and getting a couple of hours of nightmare steeped sleep a night. However today and yesterday have been miles better than days 1-4 where I really would have lost the will to live without reading posts on here.

GOOD:

3. Sharper brain. 
4. A bit proud of myself. So, feels good that way

BAD:

1. I'm afraid I can never hate weed. I still love it, and probably always will.
2. Used to smoke up over video calls with few of my friends. Miss that sometimes

This is my second time officially quitting after about 4 or 5 years of heavy daily smoking. There were periods were I would be going through half an ounce to an once a week but generally at least 2 grams a day. 

My last quit was just over 2 months before relapsing and that is the main thing I want to share with you guys today. Last time I thought I would be able to control myself with doing it just once and a while and I was very wrong. This relapse ended with me going right back to where I was smoking all day every day for months on end before I pulled myself together again and got back on the wagon so to speak. The first 7 weeks or so were pretty bad, anxiety was through the roof, nightmares, constant stomach pains, you name it I had the whole 9 yards of symptoms. Slowly but surely the symptoms became less and less. I won't say that everything is sunshine and rainbows because it isn't. Life is still life and dealing with it sober is its own challenge but one I find worthy of taking on.

 It does sadden me every time I think about smoking because when I do I think of the ""good times"" but I snap out of it when I realize how much better overall my life has become as a result of quitting. Of course there are the obvious things like saving more money, being sharper, having more time. But for me its more than that. When I was constantly high I always thought I was doing fine, better than fine actually I honestly believed that I was better than average and I was high. I cant over state how wrong I was again about that. Being sober gave me the opportunity to actually start working on myself and truly getting somewhere. Not only do I believe now that I am better suited to  learning new things, advancing in my career and future prospects but also an aspect of my life that has always been difficult for me which is building a relationship with a partner. When I was constantly high I really never really cared about others and never took responsibility for my actions or behavior. I am still learning how to do those things but at least now I think I'm on the right path going forward and I feel like I'm actually starting to build a real future for myself.

Tl;dr, is cold turkey or or weaning off better?

I'm sure many have a similar story, started smoking mid to late teens. Always struggled with sleep and weed really helped. Moved out early 20s and began smoking a bit more regularly. At 25 moved in with an old friend who also partook, and we began smoking regularly. 

Fast forward a few years, I left my job and went to university, and I was happy with my usage. It wasn't overwhelming, I likened it to having a beer or 2 after work, that sort of thing. I didn't smoke much on days off, occasional haze day but only once every week or 2. In my first year I would sometimes smoke and do coursework, but in second year I started to notice that I would struggle with more complicated stuff when high (physics degree so not overly light). No issues, just stopped smoking and working. 

Then the pandemic hit. Suddenly there's nothing else to do. My usage increased drastically, and I could feel my brain getting slower. I started to struggle with uni work even when not high. I tried to cut back, I’d say during my nightly that I wouldn’t smoke in the morning, but then the morning would come round and it would just feel so right to smoke. 

About 3 months ago I was due to visit a friend 150 miles away for their birthday. I said to myself I’d leave the weed behind and just treat it as a small tolerance break. I tell you something, my brain did not like that. The week leading up to going my anxiety started peaking and I got very restless. The day rolls round and I’m a state, really struggling to cope (this is now the last couple of months of final year of uni so pretty intense as well). I force myself though, even though my brain is screaming to just bail, so I go to the shop to get supplies, stressed the entire time and as I’m parking up at home I reverse into another car. No injuries or massive damage, paid the fellow £200 for his trouble, but I immediately bailed because there’s no way I’m driving 150 miles in that state. 

That was the real wake up call for me. That the idea of going for a couple of days without smoking could send me into such a state was ridiculous, so I committed to stop after uni was done. 

Well guess what, unis done and I’m trying to stop. I said I’d just go cold turkey over July as a rule, but holy shit it’s 2 days in and I think it’s gonna be a real struggle. I couldn’t sleep last night, everything today has been overly irritating and I’ve just been feeling miserable. I still want to quit, but I am wondering wether a little weaning off before going cold turkey would be better. I really liked the idea of just not doing it for a month, but I have work in the morning and if tonight is anything like last night I’m gonna have issues. I also have some extra uni work to do that got dropped on me yesterday, so being constantly tired is gonna be a problem. 

I’m very aware that this is how addiction works though; it creeps in and makes it seem like not a big deal. There’s always a reason to smoke, never a reason not to. My usage is not the worst, I see stories on here of smoking before work and needing to be high to get through the day, but for me its always just been sleep and the allure of a non-cognitive day. If I’m doing something I usually prefer to do it sober. I just don’t know if this is the best way to do it, even if it felt like it before.

Idk I’m gonna try and sleep, but if not I will have to cave. I am serious about quitting, or at least no longer being reliant on it for sleep, so I’m gonna post here so you guys can keep me on the straight and narrow (or even if no one reads this at least I’ll have documented my attempts and maybe that will motivate me). If you read all this, ty, from other posts on the sub this isn’t exactly groundbreaking or interesting.

Probably didn't see it, because I was too high all of the time. Stupid high brain. 
Has anything like this happened to any you before?

One good thing came out of it though, I am more motivated than ever, to never ever smoke again.
I just hope I still can get the help I so desperately need.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8483311}"

It's amazing what a difference a week makes. Just last weekend I was over quitting and couldn't imagine being comfortable being sober and was ready to use my handy app to order weed delivery in 15 minutes. Now I'm at a point where I don't even want to drink either. Just want to be in my feelings and focus on being the person I always thought weed was holding me back from. I've set health goals for myself and career goals and reading stories from Marijuana Anonymous members. When I've quit in the past, I've had so many dreams about using and having regrets and guilt only to wake up happy I was still sober. But last night, for the first time ever, I had a dream where I turned down weed and proudly told my friends that I no longer smoked. This felt significant to me, and I'm hoping this is a mental shift from all the other time's I've tried quitting in the past. Something that has really resonated with me in reading all of these books and resources and hearing others experiences with marijuana abuse is that addiction is usually a result of trauma or unresolved issues. It opened my eyes and helped me identify some areas and fractured relationships that I can no longer hide from and I need to deal with head on to feel that sense of resolution and maintain my sobriety. I don't know if I'll quit forever because that still sounds overwhelming to me, but I try the ""cliche"" of just focus on today and not getting high today, and that has been really helpful for me taking it one day at a time.

2021-07-02 12:05:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ocd7zk/only_two_paths_to_choose_from/,Only Two Paths to choose from...,"  

I told myself I would get sober on the first of the month (yesterday). I smoked that morning. But half-way through my joint I came to a realization. I told myself: you have two paths to choose from, there are only two paths. The first path, or trail, the one you have been travelling on, is a loop. It is a loop with a lot of thickly wooded, dark terrain in which you can barely see 30 feet ahead of you. It is a loop with very few clearings to see your environment and enjoy views of lakes and valleys and see clearly the path that is behind and ahead of you. It is a glum, flat, uniform path, to the point that the few tiny openings you do see are masked and seen as pretty, or decent, or worth it. There are also lots of forest fires around your trail and the smoke from them harms your health and fogs your brain, to the point which you often forget that it is a loop, and you can just get off at the exit and take the other path any time. But you have also tried that path before, and the beginning is rough, so you get scared and stay trudging along the boring path, in hopes that maybe the clearings got a little clearer or the smoke has died down a little. 

Well, it has just reoccurred to me, for the first time in a while, that this is in fact a loop and not a straight trail that burns behind you. So I told myself: you haven’t given the other path a fair shot, you may have started it several times, but you’ve never gotten more than a couple miles into it before turning around. But, from what you know from your last few attempts, and from what the map at the trailhead says, the beginning is pretty rough, and there is some challenging terrain throughout, but there are many lakes and rivers and ridgelines overlooking mountains and valleys and amazing views, even overlooking the old path you just got off. The further you trace your finger along the map the more spectacular things are marked: waterfalls, cliffs, bridges, even a zip-line and some hot springs pretty far along the path. The map also changes terrain as you walk along it, since it is not a boring old loop, and there are many side paths you can eventually take which lead you to beaches, or ski-hills, or a variety of climates of your choosing. 

At first though, it is very steep and rocky, there are lots of rocks falling back at you that you need to dodge. There are lots of fast-flowing river crossings that you need to keep your feet firm, legs sturdy, and mind focused to get through. There are lots of twists and turns and not-well-marked terrain that you must skillfully navigate using your best discretion and awareness. There are also some dark, thickly wooded areas that are reminiscent of the first path, but these areas are brief, you must not succumb to the glum, keep trudging through these with faith and composure. There is some quicksand as well a little ways out, and if you move too slowly or think about turning back, you’ll get sucked in, don’t think twice about turning back. Ignore the urge and pick up the pace and intensity at that point. You need to maneuver through this terrain with focus and composure in order to reach the good part of the path. I wish I could speak on the good part of the path more. All I know about it is from what I’ve seen on the map, a map which doesn’t have pictures, only small, symbolic images for reference. I don’t know how fascinating the views are, how big the waterfalls are, how clear the lakes are, or how warm the hot springs are, I just know that it is worth getting past the rough stuff to see and experience the path for myself. I just know that will be better than the old path. 

Well, after a few days of covering my mouth so as to not inhale too much smoke, and after a few days of going slowly and making sure to be perceptive of my entire environment and path, I have finally found the exit. Though my head may not be clear right now, it is a little clearer stepping off the path, clear enough to know that staying along the other path through the rough beginning is going to be worth it. I am entering the new path today, and I will continue to tell myself throughout that there are nice parts of the path after a while, there are nice views and places and things to experience after a while, you just need to keep trudging along through the beginning and put a mental block between the pain and you. The pain may make your body hurt, it may make you weary, but it will not change your conviction about yourself and the choices you are making. You will keep your mindset resilient, stoic and confident, and remind yourself of the strength you possess to get through this. You will keep your head held high when it gets rough and will not let the current pain discourage you from continuing. Then, when you have made it to the clearings, when you have made it to the beautiful (from what I’ve heard) hike along the ridgeline, when you have made it to the hot-springs and can relax with peace of mind, it will be all the more glorious because you will know that you took a treacherous path to get there, a path that tested your character, discipline, will, and toughness. It will be all the more glorious because you will know how much better it is than the old path, a path that many people are fortunate enough to have never attempted, or to have gotten off quick, but knowing that path will allow you to be more grateful of the path you will be on, and more receptive of the blessings along it, so it is not a complete loss. 

I am done following the dark, boring loop-trail that I have been on for years now. It’s time to face the struggle and suffering to get to the good. Although I am still foggy and glum from the old path, which may make facing this path even harder, I am eager to get going and face the challenges. I am taking with me a “bring it on” attitude, because I believe in myself, and any test along the way will only make my conviction and belief in myself stronger, not weaker, like last time. Last time when I was tested it made me weaker, I doubted myself and thought: well, I will probably turn around eventually so I might as well just turn around now. This time will be different. This time I will use my mindset to my advantage, not disadvantage. This time I am going to believe in myself, and be a mentor and a wise, optimistic companion of myself. Though this mindset may not make it any easier, it will make it more empowering. Going through treacherous terrain with a positive, disciplined, tough mindset will make me a better, stronger, more powerful person when I make it to the good part of the path. It will also make me a more emotionally intelligent, stable, wiser, calmer, and enjoyable person for myself and others to hike with, because I will embrace the good times with so much gratefulness and joy and will embrace the bad times with so much grit, determination and positivity. 

Use your mindset to empower you. Use your awareness and will to bring your mindset back whenever doubt creeps up. Be your companion, be your friend, be your mentor and guide.

At first it started as a side job along with my studies. Slowly I lost all my motivation to study and had to take a break from school.

At the time I did not mind, after all it ment I could work longer hours and get more money to satisfy my addiction. My days consisted of waking up at 5 am in the morning, going to work and as soon as I got off work I was going to smoke. I would smoke till 1 am and pass out for couple of hours before waking up. Needless to say I was VERY sleep deprivated. Every morning I'd tell myself to take a nap as I get off work but instead I just rolled yet another joint. This cycle was my life for two years; ""work-smoke-work-smoke"" every day was the same. I had no real friends and only people that would hit up my phone were the ones who needed weed because they all knew I had the best plug in town.

I tried quiting time and time again but everytime I would fall back into smoking. I realize now that it was because weed was (and still is) the only meaningful thing in my life. I tried speaking to my so-called ""friends"" about my addiction but non of them could relate. They said ""its just weed, take a break"" slowly after they stopped talking to me because I was too heavy to be around.

I knew I had to make a change, I knew I cannot keep living like this. Therefore I quit my job. 
I did this because  I desperately wanted to break the cycle I was living in. Today was my second to last day of my job.
I got off and I just have this hollow feeling inside, almost like something is missing. I know for a fact its because this is my 3th? day smoke free (I quit counting the days because I kept backsliding).

I have found myself since I got sober and I love who I am, I am happier than I have been in years. I'm finally going out and living my life. Hitting a year of sobriety was a big step for me and the beginning of my realization that I haven't been living my life. I'm 22 and have been smoking regularly for close to a decade. 

I lied to my ex-fiance about quitting, when she became my ex I turned to weed to make me feel better. For a little while I tried to date but I couldn't do it, I still loved her. So I found a FWB that would smoke with me and hang out, I fell for her hard and she fell for me but we always knew that what we had wouldn't last beyond that summer because she was moving to Florida. When she finally did leave I dropped out of college, it all happened the same day, I couldn't afford tuition and felt that it was no longer worth trying. I realized that she was just filling the hole left by my ex-fiance. I haven't dated a girl since, its been over three years since I last had a girlfriend. 

I filled my life with meaningless things to try and fill the hole left in me, I smoked weed almost constantly until I got into trouble and almost lost my dream job. Two years to the day from when I dropped out that job started paying me to go back to school. That was when I was a few months sober. Now I'm getting paid to go school and making more money than I ever have by leaps and bounds.

About a month ago I took a trip to Minneapolis and while there it hit me how much I have missed out on. I realized that I was finally ready to start living, since then I go out more and enjoy the real world. I'm finally talking to girls with intentions of finding someone to spend my life with, I don't think I would have made it here if I hadn't gotten sober.

Maybe I'm attributing too much of the change in my life to my sobriety but maybe I'm not. All I know is that only I can keep myself accountable now and I'm scared that I'm not capable of it.

Has anyone else experienced this?,"Sorry bit of a rant, I’m not sure how common this is among people on this thread. I’ve been smoking weed since 15 and I’m 24 now. But the past couple years have gotten bad as I’ve slowly isolated myself further from the world. For the past few years my life consisted mainly of just smoking and going to work, coming home drink/smoke, sleep and do it all over again. It’s been making my life feel empty and overall unsatisfied with my life and hopeless about the future.

I remember playing sports and having tons of fun with friends in middle school without substances. Then people started to form groups in high school and I ended up becoming part of the stoner crowd. At the time, I was still close friends with kids who I grew up with who didn’t smoke weed. 

It bothered me at the time since smoking weed was seen as taboo by kids in my grade. I didn’t like having restrictions on the people I could associate with. I wasn’t exactly popular but I was well known amongst guys and girls which attracted people even if they weren’t my friends. 

But being a stoner I felt the most comfortable with people who also smoked. I’d go with friends to smoke with other stoners from school. Not going to lie, I met some cool people through smoking that I wouldn’t have met otherwise. 

Unfortunately most people who smoked back then had a bad reputation, not only for weed but their behavior and who they associated with. At the time I didn’t care I just wanted to meet people. But now I feel like associating with them hurt my image too. Eventually I’d start smoking more and more often by myself than with friends, which I feel like was the turning point in my addiction. It went from a social hobby with friends to something I treated like medicine.

I didn’t play sports anymore in high school and I had no hobbies. The only thing I did was smoke and most of my friends were stoners. This made me feel like I wasn’t good enough to have healthy relationships and i was too boring to be who I wanted to be. I watched so much potential wasted.

Fast forward to now I just graduated college. It was the best time of my life as I was out of my shell more, socializing a ton and partying often . I feel like I was trying to make up for the shitty high school experience. I made some friends and lost some and lost my v card. I felt happy for once I barely needed weed. However I often ended up drinking too much at school and got in trouble a lot. I also lost a lot of my friends back home due to some conflict. Then I go back to smoking because I knew it wasn’t as bad as drinking was, I didn’t do stupid things. But it still made me feel unhappy and disconnected even if it’s safer than booze and cigarettes 

So I sit here depressed as I reminisce the best time of my life being over. It doesn’t help that I don’t have many close friends anymore. I want a social life so badly. Since moving back with my parents this summer I haven’t chilled or talked with a girl, and I only hung with some friends a handful of times. I’ve hit up so many former friends to chill on the weekends, even the ones I stopped talking to but none of them want to chill anymore.

Even my stoner friends stopped chilling with me. I’m running out of people to hit up and enjoy the summer with. The weekends and holidays are the worst because I rarely have plans back home. I feel like nobody wants to hang with a guy who has no friends. It makes me feel desperate at times as I’m always hitting people up to chill.

This is my ultimate weakness in this weed addiction. When nobody wants to hangout  with me I feel worthless and lonely so I’d smoke to make the pain go away. Except it’s only temporary and my problems are still there in the morning. 

Ive been doing this more often over the years, and I’ve noticed my social skills and motivations dwindle. It scares me to think that I’ve let it go in for so long. I worry that the weed makes me feel too comfortable being alone and living a miserable life. I don’t want to be 40 still smoking weed and feeling lonely.

But it’s the cycle and lifestyle that makes it hard to get out of. I try to be make friends then someone ignores me and I’m back to smoking weed. Whenever I try to quit I tell myself that it will help with making friends as I’ll be a better version of myself. But my mind questions if it’s even true.

I will think of stoners with great social lives and conclude that weed isn’t the issue so I continue to smoke. But then I’m back to square one wondering why my life is the same. Even though I’ve assumed people who don’t smoke, tend to be more social. I’ve seen weed turn friends to outcasts who’d rather smoke and play video games than go to parties and meet people or have any real hobbies.  

That is why I try so hard to make friends and create a social life as I don’t want to live like that. I still struggle with hobbies as I’d rather smoke and chill after work. I can’t help but think that is why my personality is boring. My friend once said weed isn’t a personality trait and it makes sense. 

Sometimes people act like that when all they do is smoke. A lot of times I’d feel depersonalization in social settings after I’d smoked. I’d just sit there in my head, not being able to add to the conversation. I’d feel numb as all I could do was smile and be nice, because my personality sucked. 

Like I couldn’t be playfully aggressive or engage in debates so I’d just sit there. I never had my own opinion or thoughts I’d just agree with everything. I feel like this made me boring to be around. Ive always been shy but weed made it so much harder to connect with people. I literally felt socially retarded at times.

So I guess I’m looking for more evidence that what I experienced is true. Have you guys experienced similar things? Did quitting make it better? I would like to quit but that uncertainty makes it hard. I’m also 24 and sometimes think it’s too late to make serious changes especially with friends. That I may be stuck like this forever and it makes quitting seem pointless. I wanted to share this on this sub because you guys can relate.

By the second week, I felt I had gone over the hump and was feeling really great and motivated.  This lasted through the third week.  I thought I was flying and that it was smooth sailing from there.

Around the month mark is where sobriety took a dark turn I wasn't anticipating.  At this point I began to feel all of the emotional centers of my brain begin to fire up...and what came forth was just horrific.  It made me look at my life through a new lens, and all of the mistakes I made being stoned for so long.  Specifically, an off-and-on relationship I had with an amazing girl.  Weed was the final wedge that drove us apart, and for a while it didn't bother me that much.  I loved her, but knew that our lifestyles wouldn't be compatible and I thought it was for the best.  I wasn't able to understand and empathize with her emotions due to the weed.  We still maintained a friendly relationship, and still cared about each other and went on walks sometimes.  But we had essentially gone our separate ways.

But after being a month sober, I began to see everything more clearly.  I wanted to reach out to her and hangout, and talk about how I've been sober for a month. In my head I was thinking that we could try and rebuild on a stronger foundation.  But when I reached out...she informed me she had started seeing someone new.  This absolutely crushed me in a way I wasn't prepared for. It was in that moment, when I read the text message, I realized just how much I had squandered. My heart sank out of my body, onto the floor and shattered into dust. I realized, when it was far too late to make amends, that I still loved her.  I realized that I had squandered one of the best things that had ever happened to me.

That was about a week ago.  I'm still trying to piece myself back together.  It's almost like a delayed heartbreak that was 2 years in the making.  A huge backlog of pain and processing that I hadn't dealt with due to numbing myself with weed.  I've never experienced such a deep, demotivating depression.

If you've read this far, thank you.  I'm writing this as a cautionary tale to those of us that think this is something you can kick in a few weeks.  It's not. Especially if you were a chronic user like myself. Your brain takes a lot longer to heal than you might think, it takes time to reprogram itself.  Being free of weed doesn't all of the sudden make everything ok.  You have to reckon with lost time, poor decisions and lost opportunities.  And it hurts in a way that I certainly wasn't expecting or prepared for.

I'm still weed-free and intend to continue that way.  But I feel I'm entering into the most difficult part of sobriety.

I used weed to quit nicotine and it worked. It also fostered a denial I ran with for way too long when it came to weed.

Now I find myself at 22, having my dream job with a engineering company and I haven’t even graduated yet, I work from home and for the last month or two, every morning has started with a bong hit. 
I can barely type out the fact that I hit a bong before I brush my teeth in the morning. I know, how gross.

All my friends smoke and I can’t wait for that to change honestly. Whether I’m an example for them or I outgrow them in my sobriety, I’m ready. Just like I was with nicotine. 
I have 13$ in my account, I started my day with the same bong rip as the day before, smoked through an 1/8th realized I was out and then started thinking of how I could buy it on the credit card or to text my sister for an advance till pay day.

2021-07-01 19:17:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/obxr26/i_need_help_stopping_ganja/,I need help stopping ganja,"  I am not much of a stoner. I have been smoking nightly for two years ...Started at age 50 for PTSD related to childhood trauma .. Basically I would often get triggered at night by my wife, and ganja helped snapped me out of it by being more objective and compassionate.. It allowed me to take a ‘Bird’s eye view’ of everything.. At my height, I was only smoking about a 0.5 grams a night of high potency ganja in a joint.. However, it pretty much always had a negative consequence of making me hung over in the AM.. That is lazy and a-motivated. 
I am not employed right now secondary to PTSD and I went half-blind.. So it’s hard to get motivated anyway .. Weed definitely doesn’t help .. 

I was on a low dose antipsychotic for a few years given to me to help with irritability and anger..I wasn’t always that way. It was just uncovering my history of child abuse (it was pretty bad), made me pissed off, hyper-vigilant etc. It definitely worked ..So did ganja .. I had to go off the antipsychotic as it was making me diabetic, which is a huge risk factor for going blind.. It’s been a month. Good news is the out of control anger hasn’t returned.. 

I’ve cut back my ganja intake to 0.25 grams in a bowl a night. Yes, I know that’s not a lot but it is really seeming to back fire now.. That is becoming more a-motivated and lethargic.. If I do more than 0.25 grams, I am definitely hung over, so I think it’s the weed and not just a side effect of being off the antipsychotic, but I don’t know for sure. Working with a psychiatrist, of course.. 

I guess my question is simple and perhaps obvious, but did anyone find that weed just started to make their mood plummet? That is, it was no longer a good thing, and was contributing to anxiety and depression? 

I feel a bit stupid for writing this as I know I am not much of a stoner.. But I am finding it hard to just quit. Probably because I don’t have much to do in the evenings and it’s become a habit to fill a void.. I started running twice a day, particularly at night, and smoking later .. Instead of at 7, I am smoking at 8:30.. That way I just go to sleep instead of smoking more .. I was able to do 0.1 grams last night.. I think it’s wise for me to taper off as my mood state is fragile and don’t want to throw too many things at once .. I’ll stick to that amount for a few days and then go from there ..

I found that I would look for Mary J even when I change countries/cities  to quit this habit. I first started smoking in college for ""socializing"". The habit haunted me and made me feel helpless.

&#x200B;

July 1, 2021: I smoked my last joint. Over the month of June 2021, I struggled to quit Marijuana smoking. I stopped for the last 1 week (before relapsing on July 1, 2021) and found that I feel better when I am sober. Relapse is due to my depression and I want to get out of this rabbit hole. It was good sometimes but it largely made me unproductive. I promise to myself that I will never smoke again (including any other smokable substance) and that I will take back my life. I won't call my dealer, M, and find ""Js"" by street peddlers. I will never hide from facing my true self and will not tolerate being disrespected for something that I can control. I will be better to my brain, body and overall health. I will look back here every time that I feel like relapsing.  I WILL NEVER BUY A LIGHTER, WEED AND JOINTS AND HIDE IN A TOILET. I want to stop regretting. I will share my progress here over time till it becomes a thing of the past. Devouring books, coding and exercising will take the place of me getting high. Wish me good luck as I make these new changes in my life. Thank you, fellow redditors.

2021-07-01 16:37:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/obun1l/my_experience_with_marijuana/,My experience with marijuana.,"Hi, 24M from small country in south America where weed is fully legal now.

Started smoking weed at age 14-15 years old, peer pressured by some friends which I skated with. Used to practice longboarding for several years, until 19/20 yo, when I started college, so I hadn't time to practice anymore.

I still got a board which I intend to use to cruise around or whatever. 

So, this went on for years, let's say 2-3, and my parents (old fashioned) never knew anything about my consumption even though they found a grinder once (they didn't know what it was for, so I made up some bs and went on as nothing happened) and I knew they wouldn't even be open to hear shit about it.

I also smoked cigs (behind my parents back), and used to drink regularly, mostly with friends when we where out skating (this is commonly accepted in our country so it wasn't a big deal for my parents). 

So I developed this lifestyle: I'd woke up, went to HS, then home, had lunch and went out to meet with my friends to smoke, bomb around the city, then go home play some Xbox, back to bed, and again.

One time, an acquaintance of mine which I bought weed from a few times before told my sister (who was an english teacher at the moment at his high school) about me, and how he knew me. 

I don't know if he really told her about the weed but he was know as a stoner, so I imagine my sister just connected the dots.

So she tells my dad about it, and he confronts me, totally devastated. In his eyes I was a drug addict now and had profoundly disappointed him.

So time goes by, I'm now 18, had finished high school, I picked up the Arts Diversified path, (which are the two final years of high school where u have to choose between Science/Biology/Humanities/Arts) mostly because I'd never put into consideration my future. 

My father had a landscaping/maintenance small company, so I figured out I was gonna go down that path too. But no, my parents wanted me to keep studying so I had to choose a career now, so I narrowed it down to journalism. I moved to another city, got a lame ass job, and kept on with my life. 

I moved 3 times in two years, due to conflicts with roommates/tenants and finally landed in a great apartment an uncle rented me which I shared with a female friend from college.

We are around 2016/2017 now, first year goes by, we had minor issues (stupid things like dishes undone, or clothes left on the laundry) but we got along pretty good. 

This is when shit went south. 

Her sister was about to rescind a contract on her apartment and was a perfect opportunity for them to move together. So she gave me a month notice that she was leaving, for me to find someone else to share the apartment with. 

I kind of panicked, so I reached out to a buddy who I had share a room before, I knew he had other drugs related habits but didn't though much of it at the moment. 

This got up to a point when I couldn't keep up with him anymore, I would feel depressed if I didn't somke a joint as soon as I opened my eyes, everything seemed uphill, started to have suicidal thoughts so I pretty much gave up everything and thought to myself ""This is where I draw the line"" 

I sought psychiatric help for myself, went back to hometown, stayed at parents house, back to my childhood bedroom.
I was  really ashamed of myself, lied my parents about why I dropped out of college and started working alongside my dad. 

At this point I was really done with other drugs habits I'd picked up, for real, but still smoked weed regularly, almost every day, I was open about it, my parents didn't like it very much but they couldn't do much about it. 

I started to feel more and more depressed as I saw myself turning into my dad in the future.

Just struggling with adulthood, I'm 22 now and see no future to myself other than work a shitty job as a gardener for the rest of my life. 

So I poisoned myself, with a fairly common plant that gives you cardiac arrest. I was found vomited in the bathroom of my parents house. 

After this I'm hospitalized, recovered in a few days, and went on with my life, hiding myself behind weed, I didn't want to know anything about psychiatrists or medication. 

I moved out of my parents house (the where never married, but growing differences over the years made them to ""divorce""/break up, they are an elderly couple in their 60'/70') and made a place for myself in an old garage, cleaned it, and made it a place quite habitable. 

I'm growing my weed now, great quality buds, smoking indiscriminately, high 24/7.

And it happened, I started fantasizing about getting into the Air Force, and started disassociating myself from reality. 
Wouldn't eat properly, wouldn't sleep properly, started to ""work out"", going jogging 3am in the morning, suspecting random people being undercover agents surveilling me and shit like that. 

This place where I'm living is kind of  ""next door"" to my mom's house, so one night I'm tripping balls, putted on a welding mask, a shovel as a ""rifle"" and went to my mother's place as if I was a soldier in my head. 

I scared the shit out of her, and was hospitalized again under ""psychotic delusions due to abuse of substances"" 

Was medicated, taking almost 10 pills everyday,  things were normal for about a month or two and then happened again, same shit. I would believe people where after me, covid was starting to make headlines on international news so I started making theories on my head, absolute delusions and this led to another hospitalization, which I was released on 1st of July 2020. It took a 6 months treatment with different medication for me to regain some control of my life again. 

I was clean for a few months, let's say, nov/dec 2020, and started smoking with some friends. 

I've been trying to really quit it since around March 2021, and I've got pretty good at identifying the things that trigger me, nevertheless I've relapsed several times, but I got to maintain +20 days sober last month. 

Today I'm a week sober and I'm taking it day by day, I go to therapy, and I think I'm starting to see a light a the end of the road. 

Anyway just wanted to put my story out somehow, and found this place to do it, o went on the discord r/leaves lounge today and chatted with great people there, I will be attending regularly. 

Best wishes to everyone, stay strong, one day at a time.

I'd like to start by stating that I am a very depressed person. I am constantly struggling to get up from my bed and I generally feel bad most days. I used to smoke to make my days easier and to remove the pain from them, but with time I realized that I have become nothing but a shadow of my past self and my self hatred only grew.

I stopped smoking 3 days ago, thinking it might help me get myself together again. But something went wrong this time (I made several breaks from smoking before, the longest one being 18 days) and I simply cannot find joy in anything anymore. I am simply sad all of the time and I don't even want to smoke at this point, I just want the pain to stop. I'm thinking about relapsing to ease my days until I figure something out, perhaps eventually I'll get some pills to help me live but for now weed seems to be the only thing that can help me.

But I really, really don't want to relapse

I didn't know I was becoming increasingly lethargic until recently. 

It's not like weed made me anti social I didn't really talk a lot in the first place but was always up for a chat but now looking back on my whole uni experience, majority of the time I was in my room high. 

Fast forward now and putting the dots together (how weed causes a dopamine release) I feel like I've wired my brain to ""chill"". pleasurable activities like talking to people, especially women, no longer excites me that much and actually makes me nervous &/ triggers anxiety. This is coming from someone who was regarded as smooth af.

And In my second year at uni I was heavy into gym, I got up to a 250kg deadlift and a 190kg squat at 76/77 kg bodyweight. I stopped going altogether and of course was smoking during this time. I attribute the trigger to being going down the rabbit hole of what the system really is and how a lot of people walking the earth are soulless beings and the political Manipulation, democracy is an illusion, mk ultra, operation fishbowl, annunaki etc etc but If I wasn't smoking weed I don't think those decisions to read and not work out would've been so easy to make. 

Weed deffo upped my lethargy. 

Am I overthinking it or is this a legit story based on how weed affects people?

If you can do that, it’s a great start! I

Now that I feel comfortable in my sobriety, I’m sober enough to see other areas that need improvement and can take sensible steps to address them.

Porn: After weed, my second strongest addiction is to pornography. I work from home now, so yeah. When I was smoking, I couldn’t control my impulses, but I feel better able to tackle this one. I’ll take suggestions if you have resources to help! Subreddits, advice, your experience.

Reading: when I was stoned I couldn’t read. I wanted to be a reader, but with my ADD and weed addiction it was just impossible. Seeing discussions of literature on r/ books made me feel like I was missing out on something I desperately wanted to understand and contribute to. I’ve ready a couple of books so far and started a third. Surprisingly, one of the biggest motivators to read is that I’ve spent the pandemic stoned and watching every show/movie under the sun. Being sober, sitting and watching tv like that just isn’t as much fun. Books open up so much more. I’m still early in this journey but I hope to make reading an important part of my life going forward.

Exercise: I see this one a lot here, and I can understand why. It helps release my negative energy, which I still have but can manage better. I’ve lost a few pounds since going to the gym. It helps me sleep. I started taking measurements using a smart scale and a lot of my metrics are well below average. It kind of scares me to think how out of shape I’ve become. Obviously my weight is an issue. But Vascular Health, VO2, BMI, Muscle Mass, and Bone Mass, are all things that I know I need to work on. Now I can because I can focus on my total health outlook. Another lifelong journey.

Diet: Tied to exercise. I eat lots of veggies and control my portion sizes and cravings. I eat fiber. Fiber is your friend! My digestion has been dramatically changed for the better. Without getting too graphic, my poppies are regular and well shaped! I don’t worry about going out and having to “go” somewhere else because I ate garbage the night before. 

Savings: Also talked about frequently. I have an emergency fund! Never had one of those. Look into financial advice subreddits for good tips and find something that works for you. No late night impulse purchases! No large weed buys. No late night food deliveries with massive delivery costs and huge tips because you’re a little too generous when you’re high. Save money if you can, folks. It makes a world of difference in my well being.

Relationships: so much better. Difficult to quantify, but I’m more present, more understanding, more forgiving. Damn if I didn’t become a bitter asshole while I was smoking. I thought weed would bring inner and outer harmony. Boy was I wrong!

Forgiveness: speaking of forgiveness, give yourself a healthy dose of it. Forgive yourself early in the journey and often. With sober clarity, you’ll likely start reflecting on things you regret. You can’t change the past. Forgive yourself. Make amends where necessary, but move on. Don’t be stuck in grief, in my experience that can become a new addiction.

It was a classroom setting. I was seated on a bed in the front left the class, my back against the wall. The teacher was speaking about some sort of nonsense. It was the beginning of the class so it was just the standard blah blah here's what to expect. I was doing things for attention, so the teacher called on me and we had a little back and forth. He was silent most of the time. 

The back and forth was about me and my perception. I can't remember the specifics. I was looking around the class for validation after each time I spoke. I recognized no one. At the end of our talk he said something like ""In your life, do you always have this perception?"" He came and stood next to my bed, and he put his nose against the wall. He then turned around and looked out over the class. I said ""No, maybe that is why I am using it here"". He then went back to teaching, using what we just talked about in an example as teachers do sometimes. 

I looked to my right into the class and I immediately saw the girl that I have an unhealthy borderline obsession with. I thought her eyes were inviting but I can't read eyes, so who knows. I awoke about 5 seconds after the conversation ended.

I thought this was important for two reasons. One, my dreams are already coming back after one day. Two, the potential meaning behind the discussion of my perception.

The alcohol part is relevant because, for me, the downsides of marijuana are not necessarily unique to marijuana, FOR ME. I have realized over the last 406 days that I have this innate desire to just 'tap out'. I'm not depressed, but I'm misanthropic. I used to wake up, eat something, and just think about how I could speed up the events of the day, so that I could start medicating and distracting myself from my thoughts & feelings, or just until I could go to sleep and 'try again'. But I noticed I do this all the time; ALL through my undergraduate & graduate programs, I would do this with my homework too - skipping through the day, finding excuse after excuse to not do my homework, until it was late enough that I could justify going to sleep because ""tomorrow I'll have another shot"". But I'd wake up and do it again. Skip through the day, distracting myself any which way, until I could justify going to sleep. Same with alcohol. If I'm drunk, I can't do anything with integrity: can't do homework, can't work out, can't do much of anything other than drink with other people. This amazingly served as a legitimate reason for not meeting my responsibilities. And to the point of the post: same with marijuana. I wake up, and toke. I'll think about my responsibilities, and then think about how early it is in the day and how much time I have to complete my tasks. This allowed me to justify (again) getting stoned, turning on Netflix, and watching the hours go by. I've got this time away from alcohol and a few days without weed, and I'm finally finding myself having to face that innate desire to 'tap out', although I no longer have any methods for doing so. It's a strange feeling.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.51377845}"

So I finally made it and have been clean now for about 2 weeks. This is my 4th time quitting weed and I am really scared of failing again. The problem I'm having is that every time I quit. I have the worst couple of days(around 2-3 days) but then slowly I start feeling better until around day 10 I am actually smiling and feeling really good(almost euphoric) when outside doing things. After that though it's always the same. Slowly I start having issues falling asleep(my mind races in a way where it feels like there is nothing I can do to stop it) and I wake up after like 6 hours of sleep and can't fall back asleep and I feel so tired and destroyed in the mornings. This usually continues for long(last time around 6 months before I gave up and started smoking again.) 

Why does this happen to me? Why do I start feeling better only to start feeling like sh\*t and then getting worse and worse instead of better?

I really don't know what to do at this point because I keep thinking it's gonna be the same every night and I honestly don't even feel like going to bed at all anymore.-            

I workout everyday and try to leave myself tired and I do feel that way right up until the time I have to go to sleep. Then my brain decides to actually ""wake up"".. 

Anyone who's had something similar? I appreciate any answers you can give me.

It didn’t take long till I was just getting high all day everyday. I really didn’t like the Brian fog and all of that cause it was causing my grades to drop and it made me feel visibly dumber so I decided to just quit cold turnkey on April 1st I barley even knew weed withdrawals existed at the time and thought it would be no big deal. Honestly it was really kicking my ass but I pushed through it for a couple weeks but on April 17th it was my 18th birthday and so I got high again to celebrate (not a good idea) and to make matters much worse later in the day these random assholes came up to us started harassing me and my friend (never seen these guys before in my life) and it got bad fast and when I got in my car and left they followed. I don’t wanna get into details but basically in the end I didn’t get my ass kicked but it still caused me to develop mild ptsd and to make matters even worse the next day i got a stomach virus. That following week was the worst week of my life and the worst introduction to my adult life. I was throwing up my guts every 10 minutes while being completely overwhelmed with stress and anxiety that I started smoking more again but ran out in a day in a half  so my withdrawals were right back into full swing. I ended up staying home from school for a week right when all the big grades were coming in while we prepared and studied for finals and my grades were not good enough to not worry. Even after I got over the stomach virus I was still throwing up just from the amount of stress. Thank god That my parents saw how much I was struggling with stress/ anxiety they had me go to therapy and I got a delta 8 pen so I could self treat my stress/anxiety while dodging the weed withdrawals cause I couldn’t deal with it all at the same time.

After going to therapy for sometime and using the delta8 every day I was able to mostly move  on past the shit that went down on my birthday but I was still smoking everyday and I felt like it was making me slow again (not as much as normal weed did but still noticeable) My therapist and I both thought it was a good idea to quit delta 8 at least for a couple of days to see how it effects me and I decided I was gonna go camping with some friends and not take any with me but every time me and my friends would try and make a plan it would fall through so I never ended up stopping and I was holding off on going back to therapy till I could quit at least for a few days. Almost a month past of me debating with myself if I should stop and about 5 days ago I looked into how delta 8 is made and all the sketchy companies that I was buying from (the state I live in delta 8 is technically illegal but vape shops still sell it) I looked into the product test and didn’t trust what I was seeing so I decided it was time and threw all of it away. The first 2 days I simply could not eat and started throwing up like 12 times a day again. I’ve got past the nausea but still have a hard time eating and although I got past the stuff on my birthday my depression and anxiety have just been so overwhelming and goddam I am having such a hard time. It’s like every time I think I’m good some thought comes into my head saying I’m such a piece of shit or i fixate on some mistake I made when I was younger and I just can’t escape it. Shit sucks but I’m just trying to push through it I just wish I was better at living in the moment and could stop hyper fixating on the past while being absolute terrified of my future.

I stopped smoking 10 months ago, and since a few weeks I got tempted when I found a grinder on the pavement, and with a friend who smokes a lot and that I've been seeing more. 

I started again with dusts of weed sprinkled on top of tobacco, this lasted quite a while but a few days ago I actually got offered weed and took it.. 

This morning, I smoked the strongest one I have since I quit and now I remember all the reasons why I quit in the first place. I have so many things to do and so little time and I'm really regretting starting again and thinking I could control it. 

So now that I have realised that it is an issue, I need to act on it and I'm quitting today again. 

Things I have learned about myself after quitting for 2 years with 2 relapses:

- Even after quitting for quite a long time, you will still get tempted. 
- Smoking weed is having the motivation for everything with the willingness to do nothing. 
- Weed affects you more than you think, for me it's bags under the eyes, anxiety. 
- Relapses can happen, they can be managed, it's good to see them as obstacles or challenges also as reminders of why you quit, showing you how much you've changed so far. 

I wanted to share my feelings and the situation. Usually when I quit I try to do it before going to my mum's on holiday, where everything is different, it makes it easier for me to quit. So I'm going there for a month from Monday.",17,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4631232}"

I have been dealing the mental turbulence of weed guilt and knowing that it is time to let it go for months..

My weed usage started back in 2016. I never did the wake and bake, it was just my end of the day treat after work and school. I got my Masters degree and smoked the whole 3 year program. Weed never was a hurdle for me completing my goals. However, once COVID hit my usage increased my personal goal, things I want to learn such as languages, and reading more, painting more. All got pushed to the side. 

I am turning 30 on Saturday and this decade of my life is for the family I have always wanted. 
I really had to reflect on my usage and sort of grieve it. 

Weed has helped me grow so much in my 20s. I was always an emotional person that FEELS everything. Weed made me feel proud of those emotions. Allowed me to not feel shame for feeling my feelings. Most people use weed to cover their feelings up. Weed helped me process through them.
I loved meditating high and doing yoga. It provided a clarity for me to reflect on the stress in my life, connect with nature, and develop myself spiritually and emotionally.

But, it’s time to let it go. 
It no longer provides me w that feeling of excitement. After I smoke I feel nauseous, I get headaches, I feel gross and groggy. Each time I smoke I regret it because I felt better before I smoked. For me, its sort of like a sign from my body its no longer serving me and it is time to let it go. 

One of my goals is to make it a year sober.

I also plan on starting a family the end of the year and did not want to go through withdrawals while pregnant. Thats ultimately the driving force for me letting it go. 
Telling myself I am letting it go allows me to feel in control rather than say I am quitting. When I use the word “quit” I feel forced or a sense of pressure which makes me want to use because This idea of ”I quit I’m not suppose to smoke”

I have been putting this off due to trying to avoid withdrawals. I know what withdrawals feel like and how uncomfortable they are. How irritable and angry I get. How sweaty and sick I feel. Ughh…
But, this time I know I NEED it. 

I wanted to spend my 30th birthday on the beach smoking a fat bowl,but I will be bringing in my 30th bday weed free! Probably grumpy, but weed free!!
