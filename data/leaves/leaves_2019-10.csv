My brain has been finally working somewhat better, I had maybe 2 days where about half the day I was in a bit of a fog but other than those I felt great. I’m feeling a lot more social and more upbeat than usual. Weed was really a bane in my life, I can’t believe I wasted all of that time. But now I can focus on being more productive! Thank you to this sub for all the motivation! I relapsed probably about 20-30 times honestly and this time I really had to tell myself this is it and this time it worked!",8

2019-10-30 23:18:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dpht38/day_3_ending_and_withdrawal_is_literally_making/,Day 3 ending and withdrawal is literally making me feel like I'm dying :(,"# First of all I hope everyone is doing well. I am gonna try to keep this post as short as possible. No one needs to read this post. I'm writing this so I can be relieved of my pain and let it out instead of keeping it all inside. Even if this doesn't get any comments, tips, help, or views, then I understand since this post might be lengthy. Please do read if you have the time and interest. 

Basically I started smoking weed around 4 years ago (I was 16 at the time and now I am 20). My first time was just a joint and a few shots ""celebrating"" my birthday. I honestly didn't like the feeling since it felt heavy because it was my first time I guess. I didn't feel any withdrawal symptoms; probably because it was my first time only. After that I honestly think that I didn't do it that much until 3 years ago (I was 17 then). I have only smoked here are there a few times and probably had a couple shots of alcohol during that 1 year I started drugs and did it on a low-scale. I didn't feel any negative effects besides the typical high school depression which happens randomly in high school, such as school work and other dumb high school drama most highschoolers go through. 

3 years ago was my second last year (I was 17) in high school and I was doing pretty good. My studies weren't bad, probably because it was a private school, I was doing decent except in a few courses I had a week spot, such as Math. My grades in most courses were 80 to 95. I was doing extremely amazing in computer courses such as coding. I loved it and even got awarded 3 times for have a 95+ in those courses. As for math I didn't fail but it was tough and managed to get through it. Even took a math course twice to try and make the mark go higher even though it wasn't even a bad mark (70%). So during this year of school, I had quit alcohol fully even though I had only taken a few shots in the duration of a year. I just didn't want to do it because I felt like doing marijuana was just as bad so doing both would make it worse and other reasons as well. Again throughout that school year like the previous year, I didn't smoke as much, probably here and there. And again, I didn't feel any negative effects besides the typical high school depression which was lowering down on its own as high school was wrapping up.

2 years ago, my last year of highschool (I was 18). I didn't smoke until December all the way to June, and this time I was doing it more, probably every other day now or at least every 3 to 4 days. I started experiencing the depersonalization/derealization stuff and was getting more depressed since school was coming to an end and I would miss all my friends and the good memories I had with them in high school along with other great memories I had during that time. I contacted my teachers anonymously and they helped. I felt support and I opened up to a couple of friends and told them to keep it a secret and they helped too. Unfortunately they helped in terms of support, but not actually quitting the drug since none of them had ever done marijuana and didn't know what it would be like to quit. They did refer me to support groups and medical help but I don't like that for personal reasons. So, I was still doing drugs but I was being supported by friends to quit, even though I didn't, at some point I even tried online anonymous crisis chats when I felt depressed. After that, I had smoked weed and drank once during the summer at vacation in Cali, I live in Ontario, Canada. I drank because of the peer pressure and also because we couldn't get weed since we didn't know where any local dispensaries were. Drinking that one time didnt have any negative effects I think but the following days, we found the dispensaries and I smoked around 4 to 5 times in the duration of a week. I think my body was starting to get used to the weed because we stopped after a week since we went to a cottage in Cali far from the city to spend the rest of the vacation. I was feeling some withdrawal effects but to a small degree, probably the next one or two days I lost my appetite and had trouble sleeping. But when we came back from vacation, my oldest brother, who was the one that was always smoking with me and my other 2 brothers, had quit. I was going into university for Computer Science and this is where things go downhill.

If you're still reading, I'm surprised u managed to read all that boring content, or skipped through it. So, I was happy going into university. I was already a year back in studies because I took a year off in middle-school for something important I had to do. I didn't mind though, because what I did was important so it was worth it of course. I got accepted for Computer Science at multiple universities in Toronto, such as York, Uoft, Ryerson, Uoit, etc. I went to York and my first few lectures were all computer-related. I was craving marijuana still but I got happy that I quit so I can focus on my studies and other benefits of quitting. But then I had a math lecture and for some reason I had lost hope in that program of study even though I really enjoyed computers. That math course made it really hard and I dropped out of university. I wasn't doing drugs anymore but I got super depressed and I didn't know what to do. I was looking for other computer programs to get into but they all had math and it was really hard for me. I went for tutorials for extra help and much more but it was still insanely hard. OSAP (Ontario's financial ""assistance"" program for students) caused an issue for me as well. They lowered down grants (money not owed back), so I had to pay some money dropping out, not a insane amount. I worked at a store called Tim Hortons and during that time I was working and throughout that year, I was sad, because all my friends are at school and here I am another year behind in studies working at a minimum wage job. I was also happy too because I had a lot of free time and made a lot of online friends playing games (this was last year and I was 19). So, my online friends helped me cope with the depression too, even though it wasn't because of the drugs this time I think. They made me had a blast and a really fun time when I would get back from work and on weekends. Sometimes they wouldn't go to school because they wanted to play with me on my days off of work. They were all mostly younger than me by a year or two, some older, all supportive and great people. But then during the summer vacation that just passed, this is where I absolutely lose control of my life.

Last paragraph probably, I hope.  So my oldest brother, now getting engaged, and on his last two years of study. We went to Cali which was where the engagement took place but over there, we had a blast overall, except for the part where I started to smoke again. I got the cravings since I was in Cali and did it before here. I smoked couple of times and I got really high and ""enjoyed"" it since it was my first in a while. Coming back from vacation, next school year is starting and here I am trying to apply for a different field of study, so I applied for Information Technology at the same university and got accepted. I was happy again that everything's gonna be fine. Until I got my first weed pen. For some reason it was more addictive and easy to use due to no smell and prep. I lost couple hundreds of dollars burning through cartridges for my pen and I had stopped working too since I went to vacation and was gonna start classes again soon. I started off with two carts in the duration of a month and after a short while it was getting more addictive but I wasn't still that addicted I think. My delivery guy went for a vacation for a week so I decided to wait a week too but this time I has symptoms of withdrawal, but I didn't even know it was a thing. I had insomnia and couldn't sleep well, I was sweating from my palms, night sweats, depression a bit, loss of appetite, a flu feeling and a few more things but it was on a lower-scale compared to how things are now, probably because I wasn't too addicted to it I think. Then I started to smoke again when my delivery guy came back, the symptoms went away but I didn't know it was symptoms of withdrawal. I remember researching about sweaty hands and didn't see anything about marijuana, just dehydration. So I started again and did it on an extreme scale I guess up to 3 days ago, my tolerance would be so high that I would eat an entire 500mg shatter bar, put 5 ml of tincture oil under my tongue, smoke almost 2 carts in like 3 days, smoke some joints along with it, and I still wouldn't get high anymore like I used to; probably because I think carts make your tolerance go high faster but I'm not too sure. So on the Sunday that just passed, I was coughing like crazy and couldn't even take a hit on the lowest voltage on the pen. I couldn't talk to anyone since I would start coughing if I started to speak. This made me realize that wait, if I don't stop, my coughing would get worse, plus I would get medical issues, I wasn't working so I was loosing a lot of money, and I was messing up again in my studies. I had a math course again and it was supposed to be easier than the math of computer science. The class avg is 48% and my average probably lies between there sadly. I tried to go to tutorials and still no help. I got 100% on my coding course but failing miserably in the math course. I have another test tomorrow and there's only 5 classes left of university before final exams. I am only on day 3 and I feel like dying now, literally. During the day, I have a lot of depression, anxiety (never had before, now I get random panic attacks and get nervous and scared for no reason and this sucks), my palms keep sweating and now I have to get a towel because of how much sweat would randomly come, it literally takes me 45 to eat one banana while before i could eat an entire pizza box, I fear night as well, I literally toss and turn and cant fall asleep and when I do, I wake up like 20 minutes after and feel like shit and again hard time to sleep, then towards the end when I am about to wake up, I have super vivid dreams that are very lucid as well and when I wake up from them I feel like I did what I did in the dream but in real life like I would be exhausted with a high heart rate. Because I am 20 and going through adolescence still, I usually never have wet dreams, probably here and there but now I literally have a wet dream every time I sleep so then I have to go shower as soon as I wake up even though I am so exhausted. I cry randomly now whenever I get negative thoughts (I have some positive thoughts but they last for a short while but they feel good when it comes.) Every other 30 mins I go to a random place like the couch or my bed or on a chair and just curl up into a ball and re-evaluate and observe my current state. I feel like I broke myself like I can't even eat one banana in 45 minutes? And when I am re-evaluating my self, I always say to myself ""you"" instead of ""I"". It's like a don't own my body anymore and that I am viewing my life though someone else's eyes now. I can't study so now I feel even more broken because I can't sleep at night, I have a test tomorrow, its so hard to study, especially in math which was already my weak spot, and then I have to go to class in the morning and I am gonna be super tired and then I am probably gonna mess up even though I am messing up super bad already I think, I come back at night from university so the next day at morning I have class again and I would be super tired. I feel like a failure because I love computing and coding and I think I am good at it perform well but the math just messes me up and its the second time again and I don't want it to happen for a third but I think I am failing already and theres only a few classes left before semester ends. I even tried tutorials and stuff. I honestly miss the weed and its effects, I would be happy, eat a lot, sleep well, have a blast but it would all be temporary until I sober up and then I have to get high again so I can be happy, eat a lot, etc. I used to be happy and stuff before marijuana but not I can't. When I listen to my favorite songs and watch tv shows and movies, and think about good memories when I was high, now I can't even think about those good memories I had because I was thinking about it when I was high and it makes me feel sad about the memory instead of happy. Same thing for a movie or tv show, if I think about a scene I enjoyed and like, it makes me sad now, when I listen to the songs I did before, it would get me sad. 

# I feel like nothing is gonna get fixed, I honestly feel like dying due to everything overwhelming me at once, like studies, family, friends, religion, wealth, health. I am facing problems from all directions now along with these withdrawal effects of marijuana. I've never felt like this in my life ever, it's hard and I feel like I won't even make it alive by this weekend :( 

Everyone says withdrawal effects usually go away but I see posts over here that people are still experiencing these things even after 30 years of quitting. And when I too my 1 week break earlier due to the delivery guy on vacation, the withdrawal effects lasted 5 to 7 days before my delivery guy came back and that time my thc addiction was so low as well. Some people have posted that even at the age of 60, their work is to wipe ass because of their past. Others posted that their friends committed suicide due to marijuana. Some are positive as well though. if you read through all that then damn I can't believe u read all of it. Anyways I am gonna go. I hope everyone quits one day and with ease and that their successful. Posts here were supportive to. Thank you all :(",5

I was feeling super emotional, instantly woke up with that pre-migraine feeling in my head and I noticed it wasn’t getting any better once I had direct light hit me in the eyes. So I did what I always do. Went back to sleep. Pretty much slept my day away and I woke up hoping it would go away and nothing It felt like my head had a fucking heartbeat (not even exaggerating). I was so out of it, attitude was so fucking low, even started crying to my wife, out of pure frustration (mostly bc of the headache) so I went and rolled me up literally the worlds smallest joint. Or how I like to call it I rolled a bowl lol and went skating around the neighborhood with my dog and it was instant relief... no headache, my mood was so much better as I was skating. Had my AirPods in jamming to Fleetwood Mac and I just felt instant bliss. I guess what I took out of it was wow, had I been abusing this plant for the last decade that I totally forgot all the benefits from it, it was like I was smoking bc I had nothing else to do, bc it was a ritual almost. I have been so much more clear minded I can hold conversations with people a little bit better and I even noticed my stutter has reduced drastically. I’m slowly but surely beginning to like the sober me. My main goal to stop was bc I’m in the process of getting my residency but I think I’m starting to see the bigger picture now. :rant over:",10

I am honestly blown away by it. It's like as soon as I get high, it's all so obvious. The dependent brain can really throw you for a loop when you're sober.

The ideas that made me relapse are quite common. I thought maybe I could moderate, and thought ""eh weed wasn't that big of a problem."" It quickly has become clear to me that moderation would be impossible. Every day I have woken up since smoking I have just wanted to get high
Even if I could somehow manage to moderate, it would take way more self control than completely quitting, if you could believe that.

I also have realized that weed DID have a big impact on my life. I have gone through so much pain and anxiety because of it. I have repressed traumas because of it. I did things I normally wouldn't do because of it. It has been one of the biggest things on my mind over the past year. O think that fact alone is enough reason to quit. Why think about something so much?

I have enough weed right now to last me for a while. I would normally say, ""I'll quit when I'm out."" Honestly though, I now understand how unsustainable this habit is. All the tough classes and all my works shifts are still here in full swing, and picking this habit up has seriously fucked with  the very smooth progress I was making in these areas just a week ago.

I'm tossing the weed tonight in a manner that it cannot be recovered, because I'm pretty sure otherwise, I would find a way to get it back.

Good luck to everyone out there trying to get back (or stay) on track",11

But i've got almost 6 years of being clean from weed. It took me 6 years to quit after I wanted to ""kill off my stoner self"" after 6 years in of being a regular user.  I just want to relax, so I like to have beer from time to time responsibly and moderately. I also like everything from tea, cigars, and yoga to ""relax"" but there is nothing quite like that floaty feeling that weed can give you (dont' mean to trigger anybody, but hey, lets be real - a lot of people do it for that reason , and want to, and do, do it all the time).

I consider myself to be a MJ addict - it's my drug of choice, and if i did it i would be obsessed with it and want to do it all the time (one of the many reasons why i don't) but I also choose to be sober from it. Because I made the choice and worked hard at adopting that mindset, I have come to peace with it as well as stopping it completely, finally, after hating on people who did it (holding resentments!) for so long.... I just think it has more potential for abuse and or addiction than other drugs. Similar to cigarettes -- widely accepted to smoke, but also widely accepted to rank it more addictive than heroin. But anyway, anybody reading this should know that it's a huge factor of self empowerment to make that choice not to do it. I like the saying ""don't hate the player, hate the game"". totally rings true with what i'm trying to say about addiction. 

Luckily, i don't have to smell it when I go outside like i have heard its everywhere in the air now. I live in Mass. I could really use the support from anyone who lives in a legal rec. state , or anyone who has using dreams, cravings, etc. to inspire me to do better things than get high. In a time where it's accepted , glorified and HUGELY misunderstood, i think all of us on this sub could read some words of encouragement. I am hugely inspired by words on this sub. So feel free to chime in.

I have given MA phone meetings a try but lately they have been pretty bad.. They used to be really helpful but people now just love to complain and dis-empower themselves. This sub has ALWAYS been helpful though- no idea why that is. Maybe people think more before they write instead of talk... also, editing lol

Extreme anxiety and panic. It wasnt the first time weed fucked with my brain in a bad way, it also makes me socially anxious days/weeks after I smoke.

Anyway, I threw my bag of weed out on a grassfield after I got this weird panic psychotic episode almost a week ago now.

Guess what popped in my mind today? 
""maybe the bag is still there?""
 ""maybe I should go out and find it and just smoke that bag and then im finished with weed for good!!?!""

Even though I freaked out to the brink of insanity last time I smoked, even tho I fuck up my life and risk my job every time I smoke, IM STILL TRYING TO JUSTIFY AND FOOL MYSELF INTO SMOKING again and again...

It made me feel insecure around her so I had to smoke every time we were together. It made it hard for me to control my emotions so we’d get into fights a lot.

Eventually she got tired that I couldn’t be sober around her. Sometimes when we’d be chilling I’d waste time by going to pickup weed or going to smoke. I proclaimed I needed weed to feel calm and enjoy movies if we were watching them. 

She was cool with it at first. But then she started bringing it up occasionally. After 6 months of being together she had enough. She encouraged me to quit it. She didn’t like how I’d be irritable and cold with her when I couldn’t smoke weed. It’s like I needed to be high to enjoy being around her. 

I even considered quitting multiple times before I met her but I never stuck it out. When the relationship started I used it to handle the stress of it all. She gave me a chance to try and quit it at first but I said I needed to quit on my own. So when I was still smoking a lot 6 months later I’m sure she lost hope. I kept telling her I’d quit or take a break, to start using it soon after.

She wasn’t completely against weed. She smoked it before at concerts and dated guys who smoked occasionally. The problem was that I was using it everyday to help with my issues. I couldn’t be happy and relaxed without it. I couldn’t enjoy being with her if I wasn’t high. She saw this and started to pity me for not being able to be sober around her.

I thought of quitting last semester when we first dated. But when summer started, I found myself alone and bored more often. She worked a full time job so she was only free at night during the week. So with all the free time I chose to smoke weed. I dealt with a lot of stress at home from my mother, so I would usually use it a lot back home. 

But the other issue is that it wasn’t the weed. It was what weed turned me into over the years. It made me emotionally unstable, where I felt like a kid throwing temper tantrums sometimes. I had trouble with self control and decision making, so she would usually have to tell me the right thing to do. She had to hold the power in the relationship because I wasn’t capable of it. And I’m sure she didn’t want that.

Weed also made me into this boring person with a boring personality to match. It made me complacent with my life where I wasn’t putting much effort into the relationship anymore. I easily fell into a routine with her and since I was high, I thought it was so fun. But looking back, she must’ve been so bored and lonely in the relationship. I couldn’t be there for her emotionally and I prioritized weed over her.

So finally she dumped me. I tried to quit up to the breakup, even giving her my pen. I went like two weeks before I asked for it back. I didn’t think it mattered since two weeks felt like enough for me. She didn’t care about giving it to me, which made me confused. It seemed like she was already done at this point. Me asking for my pen back just convinced her that I wasn’t going to improve my life.

Now I’m sitting here alone typing this. I have so much guilt and regret for letting my weed habit get in the way of my relationship. Even when she said it was getting in the way of the relationship, I didn’t take it seriously enough. I was in this fantasy that weed was cool and my ex loved me, so she’d never leave me. It sucks because I already wanted to quit. I already hated who it turned me into and what I was missing out on.

She was the only person to ever correct me for my weed habit. Most of my friends accept it as normal so I’m used to smoking with them and thinking it’s a normal thing to do. But compared to them, my ex was so much more social. She was confident. She didn’t have barely any emotional issues and she was only 19. Meanwhile I was 22 acting like a little boy. My short term memory made it so that I’d forget what she’d say, so she’d be mad when I’d always have to ask again.

I can’t help but think this is because she hasn’t been relying on weed so much to fix things. She believed you can’t smoke weed when things go bad. I should’ve listened to her. She had a genuine experience in high school. She dated around, made a lot of lasting friendships, played sports. I did none of those things so I always questioned what she saw in me. She didn’t deserve some boring stoner like me.

I hurt her so much, cheated on her, manipulated her. I don’t know why I turned into that person. I was just so jealous of her social life that I made her feel ashamed of it. But in reality I was the one without experience, without friends, and that really showed her who I was. She tried her best to point me in the right direction but I didn’t listen, I lost her and she’ll never get to be with the sober me, it sucks. I don’t even remember all of the times we had together well since I was always high.

Now that she dumped me I’ve been smoking to help me get through the pain and regret. But every time I smoke now, I can’t help but feel guilty that I’m not changing myself. I literally lost the love of my life and weed played a big part in that. I can’t even enjoy the careless nature of weed because it just reminds me of my failed relationship and past mistakes.

She will probably find a secure, social guy who doesn’t need weed to get by in life. Someone who matches her own values. I feel like a scumbag, letting my drug habit ruin this for me. I wish I would’ve quit sooner maybe I’d have her still. Because I know it isn’t healthy and I hate the person I’ve become as a result. I really want her back and I’m going to stop smoking. But I worry that she may never come back and it’s painful to accept",4

Last night a friend said some hurtful things, and as I was curled up in my bed being sad I thought ""I deserve better than this"" and of course the voice in my head said ""no you don't, you're a piece of shit and deserve to suffer"".

BUT for the first time ever, I felt stronger than that voice! I can't exactly explain what I mean by that, I just didn't feel the need to listen to it.

I'm *approaching* 6 months sober now and have slowly been making progress improving other areas of my life too. It feels good to know I'm on the right track (even though its hard sometimes). I don't need to listen to anyone who says otherwise.",32

I leaned on it more and more, until I realized I had been sucked into a sort of stoner culture energy that's difficult to escape from. 

I ended up surrounded with stoners as high school went on, gravitating towards stoners in college, and dating stoners (though my SO now is trying to reduce/quit as well). As weed culture acceptance has spread and more and more people seem to smoke it (at least in the environments I've been in) it's felt even more difficult to escape from. It was sort of an open secret that most of the non-sports kids in my highschool smoked, and at college that became nearly everyone.

In high school I smoked maybe once every few weeks or months. The summer after senior year it became a couple times a week. I quit when I went to school, but my parents pressured me into Greek life, which led back to drinking and then, when I quit drinking, smoking. When parental abuse and a stalker put pressure on me, I completely caved, smoking several times a day to be numb, staying in bed all day to the point of skipping meals, and dropping classes until I had to drop out.

Now, I live with my SO far from home in an expensive city that I'm financially struggling in, I'm isolated, and I smoke several times a day. I'm finally trying to quit, but coping with the nausea, sweats, nightmares, and general wooziness of endocannabinoid recovery is so discouraged by my present environment.

My SO goes to the dispensary (for themself and their sister and sister's boyfriend who also frequents here, and until a couple months ago for a friend who lived here and was also a daily smoker) every couple days. Paraphernalia and weed/wax containers are all over our room. I sometimes try to remind myself that I don't want to look bad to their parents (whose house this is) by being high all the time, but they frequently remind me their parents don't care. 

And somehow my whole conservative Christian family, who can't handle my transition, have become okay with weed. I tried to talk to my grandmother about it but it was difficult to make the point while sitting in front of her brother's pot plants, and she just mentioned how it helps anxiety. I tried to talk to my mom, who I thought quit years ago, but she's a regular smoker again and talked up the benefits. My dad and stepmom never quit afaik, so they're no help.

It just feels like the more I try to quit, the more everything around me pushes back.

I know I've attracted this energy to myself and created these circumstances. I just don't know what to do to block out these external signals and internal forces of habit at the same time. I feel so uncentered.",11

I slept a lot better last night, I did take a liquid sleep aid but I was having bad anxiety before bed but I didn't sweat as much, barely tossed and turned, still having vivid dreams (no nightmares thankfully) and I'm feeling more rested today. Slightly better appetite, I sadly have lost 7 lbs since Sunday but I forced myself yesterday to eat small things and today I'll do the same. My brain is still in a fog, my mood is off but I'm active and talking to friends and my girlfriend came by yesterday to keep me company and take care of me, it's just when I'm alone my mood is weird. Unfortunately my anxiety is still bad, pretty much all day anxiety with shaking and it's making me very emotional (crying at random points of the day) I mean I am upset and scared about this whole thing so that's why I'm crying too lol.

I'm seeing my old physician tonight thankfully to be put back on anxiety meds, I really didn't want to go that route but I really need the daily help with my anxiety to suppress it. When I was on meds last year it helped a lot suppressing it daily so I need that help again.

The first few days were the hardest for me.  I smoked every day, after work on weekdays, all weekend.  It was the first thing I did when i got home from work.  I did it even when I didn't want to.  This went on and on, and I had to have been near clinically depressed.  I had to take control.

I think the key to my success at this point has been that I didn't just quit smoking weed.  I started living the life that I dreamed about when I was stoned, but just couldn't find a way to pursue when I was sober.  Once those first 5 days or so were done, and I had introduced good habits back into my life (and dropped other bad habits), my confidence in the decision to quit snowballed.  I started working out, cooking, dieting, studying, taking care of everything I had been neglecting and just focused on being more productive.

And that leads me here.. 10 lbs lighter, feeling much healthier, being able to retain information again (albeit not at an amazing rate at almost 40 years old), talking to and spending more quality time with my friends, my family, and my wife.  Finding balance...

My side effects from quitting have been very minimal, so I feel bad for those experiencing things like insomnia, night sweats, migraines, loss of appetite, etc.  Maybe the other changes assisted me with avoiding these things.  My mood swings have been the worst (ask my wife), but I've been sober, hungry, tired (mentally and physically), so who can blame me :)

I am still very much on the recovery high.  The rapid positive reinforcement is invigorating!  I know that won't last forever, and I am prepared to keep visiting this sub to support and seek support.

But I know it's for the best. I've had to go to the hospital a few times for my anxiety but the panic attacks have stopped all together. I feel like I'm thinking clearer. But not sure if these feelings and thoughts i'm having I've always had? Or is it a byproduct of the weed abuse. But either way I'm pushing forward. My dreams have become more lucid. I'm still sluggish getting up in the morning, but the day goes by so much smoother without bud. Don't get me wrong I've snapped at a few people, and I do regret it. I've apologized for my behavior and hopefully I can better manage my anger. 

I've been around smokers, just soaking in the smell, but haven't had the urge to smoke, Thank God. And I don't want to seem like a religious freak or anything but reading Bible chapters have helped me aswell. 

Ive began reading Recovery by Russell Brand to better help with my addictions back in the summer, but I was still using. Now that I've been sober the book is resonating with me more, giving me drive. The one thing I do feel like I need is a Mentor. Someone I can talk to that can show me there is a better place to be, other than self medicating and self loathing.  But with time all will be well, positive thinking is something I have to train my brain to start believing.

Back when I was first deciding to quit smoking I heard about this sub from a friend and I thank him for that.

So I’d like to express a deep thank you to the community and the moderators for being here and sharing your stories. Now that I feel like I have accomplished the ultimate goal of quitting weed for a year (and probably forever) I’d like to share some of the things that I realized and learned through my many failed attempts and then my final attempt at quitting weed.

* **The problem with weed is that there is no problem with weed.**

The reality about your situation is that once upon a time or perhaps even still to this day you have come to really enjoy/depend on/respect the effect marijuana has had on your life. That is for a few very simple reasons. The studies are still true. Weed has no serious health risks and is considered physically harmless by most professionals and educated people. It can be a fun, cheaper and healthier alternative to more common recreational drugs like alcohol or tobacco. Weed can be smoked frequently with little repercussions (especially for the more experienced of us) and make any of the most mundane moments in life more meaningful and enjoyable. I'm sure there's plenty more reasons to mention but the point is: Weed can sometimes be pretty great and you honestly all already know that. It is by no means an inherently bad thing. If you think that you will convince yourself that something you have been using for days, months, maybe years on a regular basis was actually a bad thing all along then you are just lying to yourself. What's important is that you see the reality of your situation for what it is. Quitting weed is an exercise in honesty and immense self-reflection. The truth is: weed isn't bad. Weed is just bad FOR YOU.... and that's okay.

&#x200B;

* **Your real reasons to quit smoking.**

If you are like me then you have tried and failed at quitting weed more than once. As hard and as weird as it may be to admit, it may be something that you can no longer control. And if you are like me, you might've never thought you would reach this point or that you would feel this helpless towards it. Weed can take control of you and at times without you even noticing can become the center of your focus. I remember planning out my entire day, going to work, to school, to visit family, etc. No matter what I was doing, I was always subconsciously planning the moments I would smoke first and then plan out my entire day around those moments. After I had thought about the idea of smoking at a certain time, the situation was out of my control. I was convinced and determined to smoke. I would do anything I could because my subconscious had already decided I was going to smoke. I would do things like driving 12 miles at 3AM to the nearest 24 hour dispensary just to get myself a $10 joint and be able to sleep through the night. That was what did it for me. Maybe it was a sense of entitlement or pride but I decided that it was not okay for this thing to be in control of my life. Was I really this weak? Well yeah, I was. And the more I thought about it the more I began to hate that. That's one of the most powerful ideas that really made me rethink marijuana and to later push myself to quit. I realized the problem wasn't with weed. It was with myself.

&#x200B;

* **Stoner Stigma**

Weed is generally accepted in almost every city which has made it legal for recreational use like here in California where I live. Even though there's this very blissfully ignorant culture of people glorifying weed as god's gift to the human race, there are always going to be remnants of the infamy and bad reputation that comes with weed. No matter what the studies or our favorite celebrities say on late night shows, many people will still see you as more lazy, dumb, unmotivated and sometimes even as far as to see you with no purpose or contribution to society. I know this is obviously not true. I personally know many smokers that are healthy, productive and successful people. The stereotype behind marijuana-smokers is false and should be exposed and eliminated. Yet we have to consider that we can't always be waiting for society to catch up. When I smoked every day and word might've gotten around, I was being judged by my colleagues at work, professors at school, acquaintances, distant friends, my family members, etc. It wasn't the worst thing in the world. My closest friends and family still understood and knew who I really was and that all I needed. I didn't care what uneducated ignorant people thought. I was honestly okay with it. Right up until I wasn't. Until I realized I wanted people to not instantly assume I was a lazy, uncaring, unmotivated loser. It's your choice to decide if you care about that, but you could also decide to see people's opinion of you as your own responsibility. Not for them but for yourself.

&#x200B;

Whatever your reasons, find them and use them as your foundation to quit. Those were just some of the ones that really spoke to me personally.

&#x200B;

* **Preparation is the key to long lasting sobriety.**

Now that you are fully convinced that you want to stop smoking it's time to make preparations. It's just like the saying: easy-comes easy-goes. If you want to make it through to the other side then you're going to have to put a little focus and time into it. You're going to have to think about what factors can benefit you and which can hinder you. The next 4 or 5 points are all about the preparation and how you can help yourself before the big break. If you don't put any physical, mental or emotional weight behind your decision to quit smoking then you will naturally fallback and fail. The temptation will outweigh the consequence of failure. Failure is perfectly human and normal. Just be aware that the bigger your temptations, the more preparation and planning you will need.

&#x200B;

* **Anyone can quit when it's easy. Prepare for when it is hard.**

In an ironic way, the moments I felt the most ready to quit smoking was during or right after smoking. You probably have already experienced these moments of motivation. You probably also noticed that like everything else, these moments don't last. That's probably because quitting seems easy at times. However, there will also be a time when the opportunity to smoke presents itself and the conditions are ideal. Maybe you just got out of work and have some well earned time to enjoy yourself. Maybe you and your friends are hanging out for the weekend and there's a joint being passed around. Maybe your best friend just brought out a newly bought $100 bong and is packing the most savory bowl you've ever seen. Maybe Snoop-Dog rolls up out of nowhere to offer you a hit of a freshly rolled blunt. Moment's like this will 100% inevitably happen (maybe not the Snoop-dog one). The perfect opportunity to smoke weed will always appear and stare you down in the face. It is at these moments that most people will fail. That is why you have to prepare and be ready for moments like this to occur. Write them down and take note of every single time the opportunity to smoke was presented to you. Your victories aren't counted in days not smoking. Your victories are counted in the moments that you choose not to smoke, especially in the beginning of your break from weed.

&#x200B;

* **Ask yourself & take note: When, where & with who do you smoke?**

One of the best things I did was forcing myself to write down every time the opportunity to smoke presented itself and I said no. I would write down, When or at what time it was, where I was and who I was with. The 'With who' part can be particularly important for some people. You must ask yourself: Who was there supporting me and who was there tempting me? Taking note of these things can really help you understand the reality of your temptations so that you can address them and prepare for when they might occur again. Try to visualize how these moments happen and when they could happen again.

For example:

\- My house, Oct 28th, 2019 @9pm with my buddies.

\-The beach, Oct 27th, 2019 @7pm with my cousin.

&#x200B;

* **You** **are deciding to quit. Not your friends.**

To build upon the concept of ""who"" you smoke with. It is very common to see friends or people that smoke together attempt to organize a tolerance break or quitting together. I know I'm certainly guilty of being that friend that wants to organize a t-break with the whole gang. The truth is that this rarely works. It usually only takes the one weak willed or one friend who didn't really care to fail and so then the whole group also doesn't care and gives up. Then everyone is back to smoking again. Getting your friends to support you is important and can be really beneficial, especially from the friends that you frequently smoke with. However, you must never come to depend on them or their promise to quit. You have to be willing and ready to go through with it on your own. Not everyone will be on the same page as you. Weed is uniquely different for every person and not everyone will feel the same way you do. Everyone has different experiences and different conclusions about what weed is for them. That is why you can and should use your friends as a support mechanism but never allow yourself to depend on them.

&#x200B;

* **The first two weeks are everything.**

I've seen this mentioned a few times on this sub already but I really wanted to highlight this point this to anyone who wants to quit. The first two weeks are always the most difficult. Some would argue that the first month can also be difficult but I and many other people have found that the first two weeks are the most challenging whereas after that it begins to get easier and easier to go on without weed in your life. To be honest, this was so true for me that my initial plan to quit smoking was planned to only be a one month tolerance break. After one full month of zero smoking, I felt like I had gotten the hang of it and decided to triple-down and did 3 months. After the 3 months I had no doubts and felt completely ready that it was time to do a full year. Everyone may vary on this, not everyone will find only the first two weeks hard, you might feel it get easier sooner or later. The real point is that: **It does get easier.** You just have to push through.

&#x200B;

* **Taking weed out of your life isn’t the same as adding something new.**

Finally I want to address a common misconception about quitting weed that I see many people go through. This applies to those that have done weeks and months without weed and still find themselves falling back. I've seen close friends of mine decide to quit and make it to one or two months only to go back into their bad smoking habit. I think that happens because a lot of times we find that our expectations on quitting weed aren't really met. Some of my friends felt like quitting weed was going to completely change their lives and productivity. This really isn't the case, especially in the first few months. Just because you stopped smoking doesn't mean you're going to enter some kind of extreme productivity phase.

Many of you might feel like weed is stopping you from achieving certain goals or standards within your life. You might feel like weed isn't allowing you to be a productive or to be fulfilled with yourself as much as you'd like to be. This is a great idea and a good reason to stop smoking weed. However, just because you are taking weed out of your life, doesn't mean you're automatically adding better working habits, better financial habits, better social or better personal habits. Those are entirely different things on their own. If you want to achieve those goals, it's not as easy as just 'quit smoking so much weed'. Those goals take work, habit building and further determination. When I did three months and was congratulated by a lot of my friends they would all ask me. ""Have you felt different? You probably feel way more productive and focused right?!""... Nope. I honestly felt exactly as lazy and as unmotivated as I usually was when I was still smoking weed. I just had a little more time and a little more cash in my wallet.

Please set big goals for yourself but don't think quitting weed is gonna solve every problem in your life. Quitting weed sets you up for those big, character defining changes but it will not be step 1 to achieving all of your dreams. Quitting weed is taking you to Step 0 and puts you in the perfect position to then take Step 1 towards your goals. Just because you haven't started waking up at 6am, working out, eating healthier, have a new romantic partner, etc, doesn't mean you never will. Form those habits, accomplish your goals. Just don't expect it to be as easy as 'quit smoking weed' because then you will see how you haven't become the things you wanted to be and will begin to think that quitting weed hasn't changed anything in your life.

In just one year of being weed-free I decided on a major, got my first ever 4.0 GPA at college, began working full time, made many new friendships outside of smoking buddies, I have drastically changed people's perception of me, my parent's respect me more, my friends look up to me for being able to quit and I even found myself a girlfriend. These were all personal goals of mine and even though quitting weed set me up for all of these things, they are not owed to quitting weed. Those are things I had to pursue on my own. Things that I had to work for just like I worked for being smoke-free. Great things can come from quitting weed, but remember that you have to put them there. Weed isn't replacing anything.",169

After that I realized that the weed wasn't letting me properly process the pain. 

It's been months and I am still devastated and heartbroken and in pain but I know for a fact that the weed wasn't going to make the pain go away, only time will. 

My friend was struggling with mental illness, used to self-medicate with weed. I know if she had better access to mental health care she would still be here today. 

But I also know for me personally, I've struggled with my own mental illnesses, it is a constant battle, but weed wasn't helping my situation and her death was a wakeup call that I need to do EVERYTHING in my power to take care of my mental health and for me that meant doing the hard things. Weed was giving me mood swings and occasional anxiety spirals, but the sober moments between joints was where my anxiety was the highest, and despite all of the negatives for me, I would still smoke because I was addicted to being numb and dissociating from real life. 

I was addicted to escaping, I was scared to live in the present moment. I'm not making any judgements about my friend though, she did what she had to do to survive, and I wish she was still here and I wish she had the help she needed, but this is the world we live in where therapy is so expensive and other resources are limited. 

Anyways, to anyone in a similar situation, quitting after a death or quitting to be mentally healthier - I see you. This is our journey.",27

It started out as a weekly thing after a bad breakup, then a weekend only thing, then an every day thing. I never buy it myself anymore because my parents are constantly buying it and leaving it out during the night, so the financial strain that a lot of people talk about when quitting doesn't apply to me (and therefore cant motivate me). When I get home I tend to do a quick check of the living room, grab some, and go upstairs to my room to smoke and then go to bed within a couple hours. I keep telling myself I'll quit but I end up checking the living room every night anyway. At this point I've built such a tolerance that it isnt even fun for me to do anymore, but I have trouble sleeping without it. I've tried melatonin tablets but they havent been working very well. And recently I've been drinking on top of getting high just to actually feel /high/. I don't want to get addicted to alcohol and I don't see myself doing so, but I never thought I'd let my weed addiction get this bad either.

Thanks again to everyone who replied to yesterday's update. It completely took away the thoughts of getting out of my head. 

I wouldn't have relapsed yesterday regardless. But the first stages of relapsing were beginning. 

I'm sure the thoughts and cravings would have gained steam over the coming weeks, to eventually end in a relapse. This is the way I've been carrying on for the last ten, yes TEN years. Lol. 😐

So thanks again everyone. I can't really thank everyone enough to be honest!

So anyway, withdrawal symptoms: 

I'm still having mild night sweats. I think they've almost ended now though.

My moods are still up and down somewhat. But starting to level out. No more feeling so sad that I feel like crying anymore.

I’ve given up the pot and alcohol because I didn’t want the depressive after effects...but I’ve been holding on to coffee and my occasional cigarette binges to feel like i still have something. Plus all the sugar and carbs I just feel like...i want to feel better! I know I have to give up these substances because they jack me up and then i come crashing down.  But how? When? Is it too soon if I only have 75 days free from weed and alcohol? Isn’t my brain still healing and adapting to sober life? I’m still having very emotional days trying to learn how to feel again after 25 years of being stoned.  Just hoping that it comes as natural and easy as giving up weed and alcohol was. As much as I struggled with the emotional upheaval, I never thought about using again. I made the decision and it was just a done deal. I never considered giving up or going back. I will need that sort of determination to give up the “less harmful” coffee, nicotine and sugars. Anyone have a similar problem or words of advice?

2019-10-29 10:58:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dor05w/really_bad_withdrawals/,Really bad withdrawals,"I've been smoking for about 2.5-3 years now, and this past Saturday I had a wicked bad panic/anxiety attack induced by a joint I smoked that I bought from a dispensary. I'm talking heavy breathing, body shakes, tremors, shortness of breath, I was just not having a good time and it was very scary. I never experienced this bad of a trip before so it shocked me. I smoked a tiny bit of a J on Sunday, felt the anxiety coming on again so I just chilled out and it went away since it was a tiny amount I smoked. I was fine Monday, especially at work, I didn't smoke and then at night I had the same symptoms, shaking, tremors, very high heart rate (I have one of those finger pulse readers) then I had fever dreams, I was sweating all night. I think I got some sleep, but I woke up an hour before my alarm with a very high heart rate that I couldn't stop. I called out of work today and I'm going in soon to the doctor to test my heart, throat and hopefully have lung x-rays done. I'm scared shitless because my heart is acting in such a weird way, and I read withdrawal symptoms that you guys experienced here and they're pretty similar to mine, which sort of makes me feel better I guess.

It's just odd because Friday I smoked a J and was fine, lately my throat has been being irritated by smoking and feels like it kinda swells up and feels like it's filled with mucus and residue, so maybe that was my tipping point. I increased my smoking this year to smoking after work, then smoking before bed and then my typical weekend smoking. I quit cold turkey off my anxiety meds last year (which I know is stupid) and I continued to use weed to self medicate and I didn't have withdrawals from stopping my meds, yet had the WORST stopping weed just for 2 days. I don't smoke when I'm sick and I'm sure I've gone 2-3 days last year without smoking (haven't really been sick at all this year) yet I didn't have withdrawals then. Which is why I'm confused why I'm having them now? I know I have to ride this out and it's going to suck, but I'm just worried why my body is acting this way and maybe you guys have any insight? Note I've been battling anxiety and depression for 10 years now, and last year I stopped taking my meds and switched to weed to help me but now it's biting me in my ass. Sorry for such a long post too!",6

Took me about 50 days or so to start to feel 'normal'. This takes time, commitment, consistency, hard work and most of all, patience. STICK WITH IT, DO NOT GIVE IN!","Guys and gals, 

My mood has been much more consistent. Before, if I had a lack of sleep, that was a trigger for a depressing day. No joke, I'd be stressed and angry and just not in a good mood and I would be depressed. Now, I'm just tired like a normal adult. Wake up in a decent mood/kinda excited or whatever, but just tired like a normal fucking adult. I track my moods and the last week has been great. Even on Sunday, I was hungover AF but I wasn't depressed or triggered to smoke, I was just tired and hungover lol. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, DO NOT FUCKING GIVE IN. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PROGRESS AND GOT TO START OVER AND GO THROUGH ALL THAT DEPRESSIVE BULLSHIT AGAIN. 

&#x200B;

I have never been more determined to not smoke again or for a longgggg ass time. I love this consistent mood/sobriety life. Here are some keys:

&#x200B;

1. Consistent exercise 
2. Good diet
3. Talking with people and stepping out of your comfort zone 
4. Compliment and love yourself 
5. Take ownership of your life and stop being a bitch. Stay sober. Do the hard thing. Be an adult. No one gives a shit about you except you. Be cognoscente of your life decisions. The past is the past, the present in now and the future is determined by what you do right now. 
6. Fill your schedule with other things. You have to swap out being a stoner and doing nothing for actually doing something. Boredom is the biggest trigger to smoke.

2019-10-29 10:16:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/doqffw/sleeping_tips_that_sort_of_help/,Sleeping tips that sort of help,"This is my 3rd big quit attempt since Aug 2018. Each one of those has had it's share of sleep challenges. Here are some tips that have worked a bit for me.

1 hour (or even 30 mins) before bed; turn off all screens, turn off the lights, and put on some audio. I use something sort of interesting, but mellow. Like a history podcast. Definitely not a comedy podcast. Music doesn't work too well because the mind just wanders. I am looking for something with structure. The tricky part here is that you have to look at your phone just a bit to start the podcast.  The idea is to stop my mind from racing on its own and keep it busy.

If you have to look at a screen like a phone or laptop around sleep time, make sure to have a bluelight filter. Sometimes called twilight filter or something like that. 

Another technique I use if I don't have a podcast or other audio is to try and remember all the details of a recent day that I really enjoyed.  I think back to a day I went on a hike with my dog for example. I remember how I got ready for the hike, got in the car, the drive, parking, the hike itself, what I did after, etc.  In all of those things, I try and remember as much detail as possible... Like minute by minute.   This again is a way of keeping my mind busy instead of letting it wander with circular thinking.

The biggest issue I have is waking up too early and not being able to fall back asleep.  My mind just turns on. My body starts to feel sore. I start to worry about how tired I will be all day. This is an important time not to turn on lights and screens. That makes it much worse in my experience. Instead I start a podcast or do the thing where I remember all the details of a good day in the past. I try to avoid putting on news radio as that can lead to more worries.

One last thing that has helped is a lamp that simulates sunsets and sunrise. They cost $30 and up. 30 mins before sleep I start the sunset feature with a podcast on. I also set it to start the sunrise 30 mins before I need to be awake.  This is much better than the sudden blast of lights in my room or bathroom.

If none of this is working, I still keep the lights and screens out.  I get out a yoga mat and do some relaxing yoga stretches that I have learned from YouTube yoga with Adrienne. This helps with the inevitable stressful muscle tension that comes with these times.

If possible I eventually just get out of bed a little early and start my day earlier than planned. This is not optimal, but sometimes it's the last resort. Those days are usually pretty tough by the late afternoon.

Hope some of this is helpful to all of you sleep deprived leavers",4
2019-10-29 10:09:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/doqcdp/the_tiger_in_a_cage/,The Tiger in a Cage,"**I wanted to share a thought exercise that helped me and many of my friends reframe our addiction and the process of getting sober.** 

Imagine a tiger in a cage inside your brain. The tiger is always hungry, and you're the only one who can feed it. Right now, the tiger is confident and strong, because you're feeding it everyday. You spend a ton of time and money feeding it, but the tiger stays quiet, so you're happy with this arrangement. 

One day, you decide not to feed it. The tiger doesn't know what's going on, but can go a day without eating. 

Then you go another day without feeding it, and the tiger starts to get angry. It throws its body against the cage, it roars until you can't think, it screams at you until you finally give in and feed it. Then the tiger is powerful and quiet again, and you feel comfortable again.

But if you go another day, the tiger starts to get hungrier, weaker and confused. It starts to whine and beg, it starts to claw at the cage, and with each passing day it gets more and more frantic, clawing and whining and begging louder and louder until you feel enough pity or fear or anxiety to finally feed it just to get it to stop. And then the tiger regains its strength until it's once again strong, confident and in control.

But if you stay strong and don't feed it, if you ignore the screaming and the whining and the clawing and the begging, eventually the tiger will get weaker, and weaker, until the screaming stops, the whining stops, the frantic clawing and begging stops, and the tiger dies. And all of that space it was taking up, all of that time and money spent feeding it, is yours now.",55

Two years ago I needed to quit for a hair drug test and this sub helped me immensely. I was able to stop smoking for 6 months and in that time I was my  best self. Ever since then I have been on and off with smoking. I knew the harm of this, but I was in my final few semesters away at college so I wanted to enjoy ""being a kid"" as much as possible. When I graduated this past May, I thought I would quit for good as I now had to adult. That lasted 3 days being home. All summer and now going into November I am still smoking. However, this time, I cannot bring myself to quit. I am working a shitty in-between job to make money to go back to grad school and on top of that my girlfriend who is my everything is in a different city for the time being. I'm still doing all the things I need to get done and then getting high after at night, but I do not want to live this life anymore. I know I have so much more in me than the bare minimum that I am doing now. I want to find a new job, but weed is making me comfortable with the terrible job I have now. I do not know why, but I just cannot bring myself to quit. I've tried throwing my weed away and breaking my pieces, but even after that I found a way to smoke the next day. I know how shitty the first few days of quitting are and I am terrified of them and keep pushing them off just to get a little high every night. I do not know what else to do at this point.

But this time around  I need to give up alcohol too. Was definitely abusing it and using alcohol as a replacement “getaway” during my almost 7 months away from weed, although I couldn’t use it everyday like weed. I would get so used to looking forward to the nights of drinking on the weekends as a respite from the monotonous office grind, the sameway I would get used to looking forward to a nice joint after-work. 

Sadly, I feel like my reliance on alcohol as an escape triggered me to start using weed again. I thought “hey I can’t stay sober so I might as well start my weed abstinence over when I’m not getting drunk every weekend and still being a time/money waster” and even posted on here about how I was frustrated with that tempting thought. But a few days later after I made that cry for help post, although it made me delay my relapse, I still eventually caved into the seductive thoughts of trying to smoke again and enjoy it for a few weeks before kicking the habit. 

Here I am 16-days later, after smoking 16-days straight, eating a ton-of junk food(to the point where I had diarrhea twice) and spending a ton of money on dumb stuff that I was trying to save. I didn’t do as much damage as I thought I would in 16-days, but I sure do see the distinction between high me and sober me very well now. I definitely didn’t realize how detrimental that post-high malaise you feel stuck in is to your next day. I see weeds effects more acutely now. If I can make it to the end of tonight then I will be at day 1 again. Ugh. Don’t be like me y’all, don’t relapse. It’s not worth it. I hope I can make it to a year this time. The feeling of failure right now is pretty demoralizing though. And the thing that sucks is, that feeling of failure from relapse leads me to more relapses. I hope I can escape this vicious cycle and finally quit for good.

-slight paranoia when returning to work
-long term natural dopamine deficit 

I just didn’t WANT to! It’s great when I internalize these things to the point that I put the stuff down because I just lose the appeal. 

Hoping and praying for continued mindset switch.

I swear the grass was 10x greener today, the fall colors just jumped out and hit me hard. When I was a smoker, I was never too into nature. I never looked around and appreciated it. But today... it was different. It's 5 PM now and the sun is about to set and I have this deep primal bliss and happiness. Nothing really interesting even happened today. Or this entire week. But every day since quitting, the random meaningless shit just started to feel better and better, like it was gaining meaning.

The fog that comes with weed hides these things from you, it robs you. Truly amazing.",20

I started getting high at uni, but didn't start smoking regularly until before my junior year, after my boyfriend and I broke up. It started off as making me feel good and relaxed and giggly, but I guess I never realized that it might have been my way of coping at the time. 

With all my friends smoking around me, it just kept going. I didn't think it was too bad, since I wasn't the only person who smoked so much. Plus, I'd eventually gotten to the point where I could function high, so why wouldn't I? I could do things and feel good at the same time. Eventually, though, I noticed that it was harder to quit. 

I graduated college, started a job, and hated my life. I should've been grateful, I know. I had my life together, but for some reason, I found myself getting really depressed. I turned to weed, even more than I already did. Then I was in a short-lived shitty relationship that didn't end well, further making me resort to weed. I was smoking so much weed at this point, I was rarely not high. 

I'm trying to be an adult and be healthy and take care of myself, because I'm tired of feeling shitty. While I have my issues, I've honestly never felt so helpless. I can't help but to think that some of the blame goes to my weed addiction. I think I unknowingly depended on it, and now I don't know how to feel normal. Being high has become the normal (even though I barely get high now). 

I've tried quitting a few times, but I HAVE to now. I'm almost certain half my anxiety is coming from my addiction. I quit 2 days ago and the symptoms are so tiresome. I wake up with severe anxiety, to the point where I can't fall asleep. Night sweats, short temper, inability to sleep. The worst of all, though, is my lack of appetite. I don't want to eat anything, because I feel nauseous, but then not eating anything gives me more anxiety and makes me more nauseous. Everything is effort. 

I guess I'm scared, because, what if I stop smoking and I still feel shitty? I've heard a lot of people say I'll think clearer, have more clarity, feel better, remember things, etc. But will I really? What if I don't and still feel like garbage?",1

Dam...,"I felt anxious about going to Dam as I was on a sober streak of 5 days (something I couldn't keep up for the life of me!)... I went into the trip knowing what's to come HOWEVER my mindset had changed. I was already coming around to the idea that weed is shit and has no benefits and that all its done is had a negative affect. So because I'd already felt this, although I was auto pilot smoking, I was disgusted with myself the whole time and became very withdrawn... It was strange but needed. I also noticed the patterns, pressures and triggers my stoner peers had picked up as addicts and my respect for them had lowered (including my self respected). Previous to this trip I had been reading alot about Schizophrenia as my uncle suffers from it. 
Anyway ff to Saturday eve, I end up taking truffles in a concert venue and having a bad trip which felt like a psychotic or schzyophrenic episode. It was the a blessing in disguise (although the most traumatising experience) and is what I manifested from addictive years of guilt, shame, paranoia and fear. 

Addiction to weed does not open your mind, it actually closes it into a bubble of obsession with SELF. Whether it's the obsession with wanting to make your SELF high or the obsession with getting your SELF off it... It consumes you, it isolates you from loved ones and it can be what opens your world to more mental health issues, depression and anxiety. I hope you don't have to experience a traumatising trip to put you off it and I surely hope you read this and think your mind deserves better. X",2

2. Often tired
3. I second guess my sober self (my real self) when I get high
4. Recurring negative thought patterns
5. Bad memory
6. Always craving something
7. Anxiety when not high
8. Big distractor from goals and dreams
9. Dulls the senses / emotions
10. Less emotional maturity (runaway from problems mentality)
11. Slower reaction time
12. Loss of wide range of vocabulary
13. ""I'll do it tomorrow"" mentality
14. Uncertainty of my true feelings
15. Gateway to other addictions
16. No energy to do mentally difficult tasks or tiring tasks
17. Easily more irritable when doing meticulous tasks. I think ""screw this I just want to be high""
18. “Pot is for the people who want to distract themselves from the difficulty of reality”
19. Wasting time, sitting around, lazy, anti-social
20. Causes daydream about a different, better life that leave me stuck

Ive been getting high for about 8 years and I realize how strongly its affected me living the life of my dreams. In fact I've realized that getting high has been a distraction used as a tool to make myself feel better for not following my passions and what my spirit is telling me. Im on the spectrum of one or the other. Especially when I'm home alone getting high often.

Don't get me wrong, weed has many beautiful benefits. But when it becomes an escape from what I'm really feeling, it causes suffering. Weed has always been there for me when I haven't been there for myself. When I've neglected my feelings, my energies, my passions. I turn to weed to make me feel better. So thank you weed for what you've done so far. But I can handle the rest without you.

As many of you know, smoking causes us to waste our time and that was the same for me. For me, I had smoked habitually for 7 years and, as a result, my college career went up in smoke. I managed to graduate, but not with the best of grades and that forced me to switch majors into something I find little satisfaction in. I wanted to be an engineer but now I'm an accountant. I realize, I'm still in a decent position relative to where I could be and I'm grateful for that. But it still hurts to swallow that pill.

For those still struggling, know that I had failed to quit weed many times, countless times, really. So what made this time different? Well, I had already failed to quit so many times that I realized this time had to be different. I had just finished school and most of my friends moved away. If I let weed take control me any more, I'd never get out of my shell and leave that couch. 

How I quit:

After smoking a bowl or two and coughing my lungs out (I'm asthmatic and smoking didn't help that), I decided enough was enough. Previously, when I'd try to quit, I would smoke away the last of my bag and tell myself that I just wouldn't buy again. Next thing you know, you hang out with a friend and he brings a bag and your back to smoking everyday.

So this time, I had all my supplies in front of me, still about an eighth left of my bag and a freshly burnt bowl. I was alone which had become more common than smoking with friends. I said, ""Fuck this, I'm done."" I had been planning to, again, finish my current supply and vow to never pick up. Not this time, I grabbed my bowl,  my weed, my bong, my grinder, hempwick, my weed, everything and I threw it all in the trash. Then, I told my close friends that I was quitting and some of my smoke buddies that I had an upcoming drug test. It became so much easier to say no after to people who wanted to smoke with me. I could sit next to people smoking and be fine. 

Hope this helps! Stay strong.",3

I started smoking daily as a freshman in college, and nearly 7 years later I have begun the process of quitting, and am now 9 days sober. I've gone from smoking all day everyday in college, to smoking only all day on the weekends for years, to in the last year only smoking at night, to in the last couple of months taking a few days off here and there, to finally no longer wanting to smoke at all. 

I've tried to quit in the past, but this time feels different. Before, it felt like everyday I was making a decision NOT to smoke, because my default was to smoke. But this time, it doesn't feel like I'm choosing not to smoke, but that I would need to choose to smoke. It's a new feeling for me that just naturally happened, so I'm going with it. I didn't plan this out, and because of that the withdrawal symptoms timing is less than ideal.

I am struggling right now with extreme mental fog. It feels like there's a filter on my brain, and I can barely access my thoughts, and that I'm mentally reaching through sludge to pull them out. No matter what I do it's not helping. My brain normally runs extremely quickly, and my job relies on this - I'm the CEO of an early-stage startup, and everyone at the company is counting on me to make quick decisions and tell them what to do. 

I've never dealt with mental fog this bad before and I have no idea what to do to break through it. I know if I give it enough time it will eventually go away, but I'm looking for any short-term tips that can help me stay on my game - if you've ever worked at a startup, you know every day counts, and I don't want my journey to sobriety to have a negative impact on my business. 

This is an amazing community and I've been reading a lot of the inspiring posts here, so figured I'd come here for help. Thank you!",3

I just passed one month. What a difference a week makes! Now I’m battling with caffeine withdrawal, conquering the last of my serious life-impacting addictions. 

The nature of my personal relationships (what few survive) is dramatically increasing. People respond so much better to me, and I to them. I can sustain eye contact... better than the other party, usually. I am present. I am helping people. And people want to help me. That sense of isolation, of utter aloneness, is just a lie that Mary Jane tells us so we’ll spend all of our time with her. 

Helping, and listening, and having genuine human connection, feels a lot better than any high alone in my apartment ever did. 

Caffeine withdrawal is bringing on a ton of anxiety, but I know I can handle it a lot better simply by talking myself through it, talking to friends, working on meaningful projects/hobbies, and of course, eating well & working out. 

My secret trick? A part-time night job at a warehouse. It helps me beat the nighttime anxieties and insomnias, while getting me in shape. I have four-pack abs already!

I was just craving the feeling of getting high because once I got high it was just shit.
I saw myself lose control of my life that I had build over the two months before that.
I saw myself falling back into the same cycle so easily.
I saw myself become lethargic again.
I saw myself take fucked up decisions over the last two weeks again. 
I saw my insecurities and anxiety - that were caged with great difficulty - come out again.

2019-10-27 19:49:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/do146g/1_month_sober/,1 month sober!,"Today marks one month for me not smoking weed! I’m so proud that I can say that! I used to believe I wasn’t addicted until I had tried to quit before and realized I just couldn’t handle that shit. If anyone ever called me an addict, I would get very defensive and it wasn’t until I was able to tell myself that I was indeed addicted that I was finally able to break the habit. I had been smoking weed for almost 15 years, pretty much my whole family does. They are the type of people that think smoking weed is completely okay.

But now that I’ve finally hit a month, I can’t imagine going back. It honestly feels like it’s been way longer then 31 days. I recently went to my parents for a visit and they were nice enough to smoke in their bedroom because I didn’t want to be around the smoke and I was completely okay with not smoking, not a single craving!

In order for me to do it, I had to get rid of all my bongs etc. I made it so I couldn’t even if I wanted to. I wrote some reasons for quitting on a board and everyday I would up date the number.  Sleeping sucked for a long while but once the night sweats eased up it got better! I hope this helps anyone out there because this group has really helped me!

But I just realized I didn’t like where weed had taken my life and wanted to change. I realized mental health was a daily struggle. I realized I wanted to rewire my brain to enjoy life and be with people and get things done.

I knew I had to say goodbye. So I drove up to my favorite smoke spot, put on Blonde, and smoked my last blunt or whatever it was. This was my farewell. I had a good cry. Genuinely grieved losing what weed had been in my life. I just know I can never go back. Not once I’m healthy, I’ve believed that lie before. Weed is a sneaky little fucker. No this was for good.

What helped? Umm around the same time I started meditating more. My counselor advised me when I was wanting to quit, to just make a deal that I could smoke but only if I meditated 5 minutes before it and was present while I was smoking. Mindfulness is something I believe in and the same thing dissolved a porn addiction too. Makes ya realize you have a choice maybe. But maybe on a deeper level than you realize.

Soon after I quit I had something else happen that changed my life and realized I wanted to meditate an hour a day. 

Realized how amazing and energized it feels to just talk to the people that are close to me. About life. I think that’s maybe the biggest one. I went through life so lonely for so long, not even knowing I was lonely, not even knowing many have friends they talk to every day. And share life with.

I still have been having struggles with that. Just sharing the simple eternal everyday struggles of life with people. It’s a big world, easy to get lost in the fray. But this I have found to be the biggest determinant of life quality. Going through life *with* some people and not just in a vacuum inside my skull. My self was a good place to start.

That and a good night’s sleep. 

Good luck to everyone. Thanks for everything.

Since quitting I made some big changes in my life and will continue to once I can stop working and commuting so much. It gave me much more motivation and much more awareness of my patterns that have held me back from living the life I desire. For the first week (and from then on too) I advise daily cardio. Your body will be anxious if it doesn’t move around some of the energy you’ve been stuffing down for a while. Plus those endorphins and serotonin. Do it outside, in the sun.

In fact, throw everything you have at quitting. Every single resource you have at achieving an enjoyable sober mental state. That mentality really helped me and I still find it useful in every day life.

Been feeling emotions I haven’t felt since a kid. And my body won’t let me neglect itself. If somethings wrong I have to face it and fix it. Like today. I’m tired and I haven’t shared life with mostly anyone this week. And I can’t escape that I have to fix it.

Much love.

Say, you want to write a song. Or read a book, watch a tv series the whole way through sober or save up to travel. Just pick one thing and really zero in on it and remind yourself of how if you continue smoking weed, you can't achieve this goal.  
And when you've achieved it - dude that's amazing! Celebrate! And set a new one. One day you will feel able to set many and have the capacity to achieve them all.

Yeah it was tough. But oh wow, the benefits have made it so, so worth it.

Some improvements I've noticed/changes which have happened:

- I've been more creative (art, taking photos, making birthday cards, writing poetry)

- more sociable (and actually really enjoyed the social situations I've been in far more than when I'd been smoking as I hadn't just been basically waiting to get straight home for another joint/been very overly anxious being around others)

- decided to move to a new city and had a load of opportunities have opened up to me with that

- planned two trips out of the country using money saved/that I knew I wouldn't have to put aside for my habit anymore

- I'm much more awake in the mornings and feel better rested

- more motivated to exercise and do more active things that I enjoy

- more organised (use a bullet journal to plan my weeks/track positive habits I'm trying to maintain)

- smiled and laughed (genuinely) a LOT more

- been weirder and more expressive of my personality (which makes me much happier and feel at ease with myself)

- smoked less cigarettes

- ate less shitty food

- been around to support my family and friends more 

A month can change so much!

Is this normal? I've already gone to a heart specialist and got ECG, Echocardiogram and also got a holter for 24 hours.

The ECG mentioned it was a Borderline ECG but it also mentioned that I had left atrial enlargement along with sinus arrythmia. The holter showed normal results with the lowest bpm at 33bpm while I was asleep. Doctor said it was normal because it was regular.

2019-10-26 19:08:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dnlc2k/physical_pain_can_be_part_of_withdrawal_and_it/,"Physical pain can be part of withdrawal, and it can start weeks after you stop smoking.","Hi everyone,

I'm writing this in the hopes that someone who is planning to quit will be better prepared than I was for what it's like to go through withdrawal. I'm in debt to u/pawsleaves for his posts, as well as [this thread](https://www.uncommonforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=90939) at uncommonforum. They are what helped me understand what was happening to me. I wish I had figured it out sooner and spared myself over a month of terrible health anxiety. 

""Everyone knows"" that withdrawal from marijuana is mild and doesn't include any physical symptoms. At worst you get some mood problems and insomnia, right? This is what I believed when quitting, and I was wrong. Withdrawal \*hurts\*. If you're in physical pain after quitting, there's a good chance it's caused by withdrawal.

My symptoms:

* Joint pain. The worst was in my shoulders, but also in my elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. I don't have any restricted movement, and the pain actually seems to be more in the muscles / tendons that attach near the joint, than in the joint itself. But it feels like ""joint pain"" most of the time.
* Chest pain. I feel sharp pain in my left side, kind of in the ribs under my armpit, that comes and goes and moves around. Sometimes it's under the armpit, sometimes it feels like it's in the diaphragm. I also have pain where the ribs connect to the sternum on both sides, very similar to [costochondritis](https://www.healthline.com/health/costochondritis). This moves around as well.
* Muscle pain. This is worst in my upper back and shoulders, especially underneath my left shoulder blade, but also flares up in my lower back, down my arms, and in my legs (less often). The muscles feel very sore and tender, like I've been working out, but I haven't. Rubbing them helps, as does physical activity to loosen them up. Painkillers seem to help as well. Again, moves around day to day.
* Headaches. Mostly low-grade but last all day sometimes.

For me, all these symptoms came on about 3-4 weeks after I stopped smoking. I had been a daily smoker for over 17 years, on a nights and weekends basis. Probably went through a gram of flower a week or less -- not a super heavy user by the standards of this subreddit, but very regular and consistent every night after work and several times a day on weekends, for almost 2 decades with no breaks longer than a couple weeks. Never touched concentrates, rarely used edibles / tinctures. I sometimes quit for a few weeks at a time for travel and never had any serious issues, so I thought I knew what quitting for longer would be like. I was totally unprepared for the physical symptoms I encountered, and developed very bad health anxiety as a result when I began experiencing them. The first 3 weeks after quitting I felt basically normal, maybe a little irritable, but then things rapidly deteriorated.

At about 3 weeks after quitting, I came down with a bad case of bronchitis with a dry raspy cough, and a week or so later began noticing more and more physical symptoms. In retrospect, I am not sure whether this was a coincidence or if the illness brought on the symptoms of withdrawal / made them worse. What I do know is that I went to the doctor once a week for 6 weeks, had many blood tests, a chest x-ray, and other diagnostics done, and none of them showed anything wrong with me. I was completely convinced that my pain and other symptoms (see below) were caused by lingering effects of the illness, and was freaking out worse and worse when doctor after doctor told me there was nothing wrong with me.

At first I was convinced I had pneumonia / pleurisy from the respiratory infection, which would explain the chest and back pain. A pulmonologist I was referred to eventually convinced me this couldn't be true, but was sympathetic that I might have had pneumonia earlier that had since cleared up. But if it was cleared up, why were my back and chest still hurting? He didn't know. I got tested for hemochromatosis, which would have explained the fatigue and joint pain. Negative. Next I latched onto the idea that I had walking pneumonia caused by [mycoplasma pneumonia](https://www.healthline.com/health/mycoplasma-pneumonia), which would explain the joint and muscle pain. I convinced a doctor to give me a Z-pack to treat it, but weeks later the symptoms had only improved mildly, and a diagnostic test for the bacteria came back negative. At that point I started considering more exotic ailments I might have, like MS, or that the virus had done nerve damage somehow. I also noted how closely my pain overlapped with the symptoms of fibromyalgia (which has no known cause), and was considering trying to get a diagnosis for it, just to have an answer.

It was around this time (10 weeks post quitting, ""sick"" for 6 or 7 weeks) that I discovered this forum and learned about PAWS. I spent a lot of time reading u/pawsleaves excellent posts, for which I will always be grateful, as well as the uncommonforum thread I linked above. The puzzle pieces clicked into place. I might have been sick a month ago, but what I was feeling was not caused by a virus or infection. It was caused by withdrawal.

Other physical (but non-pain) symptoms of my withdrawal:

* Dizziness / ""wooziness"", often paired with nausea and a sinking feeling in my stomach. Made me feel like I needed to lie down. Worst in the morning, but flared up throughout the day. The nausea killed my appetite.
* Muscle fatigue / unsteadiness. I never felt out of breath or like I was about to collapse, but just generally weak and unsteady on my feet.
* Hot and cold flashes. Burning up one moment, freezing the next. Sweating with clammy palms.

For the first 2 months experiencing these symptoms, I had very bad health anxiety, convinced that something was very wrong with me that needed fixing. One day home sick, the anxiety was so bad I was convinced I was having a heart attack and checked myself into the ER. A very patient ER doctor assured me I hadn't had a heart attack, and recommended that I talk to someone about anxiety. I spent the next 6 weeks looking for answers online, but it wasn't until learning about PAWS that things started to actually make sense. After a week of reading, I was feeling much better, because I finally had some answers about why I was feeling the way that I was. I believe my anxiety would have been much reduced (or at least not focused on the idea of my having a terrible disease) if I had just understood that withdrawal could cause these symptoms.

It's important to note that not everyone goes through what I have. But enough people obviously do that, at this point, I'm satisfied with withdrawal as an explanation. And that peace of mind is really invaluable.

It's crazy to think that I used a drug daily for 17 years without understanding what it was doing to me, physically, besides making me feel happy / sleepy / horny. I didn't know anything about the endocannabanoid system or how many parts of the body's homeostasis processes it helps regulate. If you're interested in learning more, I strongly recommend reading this [osteopthic paper](https://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2093607) about what the endocannabanoid system does in the body. It helped me come up with some plausible-seeming hypotheses for why I and other people experience these symptoms quitting after long-term use. The TL;DR is that when you're putting external cannabanoids into your body on a regular basis, your body adjusts to this as the new normal. Then when you stop, it takes your body a while to find the right balance again. I don't know enough about medicine to say whether this would be primarily due to your body no longer producing enough natural cannabanoids, or if the recepters themselves become less sensitive due to chronic over-exposure, or some combination thereof. But it's uncanny how many of the symptoms of withdrawal are related to the functions of the endocannabanoid system:

* Inflammation and Connective Tissues: endocannabanoids reduce inflammation in the joints. Medicinal marijuana helps relieve the joint pain of arthritis sufferers.
* Temperature regulation: responsible for hot and cold flashes in withdrawal
* Nociception and Pain: There are CB2 receptors throughout the body's peripheral nervous system, and these receptors actively dampen pain in the surrounding tissue. ""CB2 signaling decreases the release of activators and sensitizers from neighboring mast cells and macrophages. Functioning of the endocannabinoid system at the peripheral terminal of the nociceptor provides the “first line of defense against pain.”
*  Hunger and Feeding: should be self-explanatory

Of course, there are very many CB1 receptors in the brain itself, which are probably responsible for the more mental and emotional aspects of withdrawal (mood, sleep, anxiety) that are more typically associated with marijuana. But again, those are the things people already seem to know about and expect. For me, the real surprise in quitting wasn't how my brain responded, but how my body did. It caught me completely off guard. My mental symptoms would have been much more bearable if I understood what was happening to me physically.

I hope this finds someone who needs to read it. I wish I had read something like this when I first quit.",42

I thought I’d try something new and searched for a shaman near where I live. I found a few and picked the one that resonated with me the most. The shaman was a sweet old lady with blonde hair - you would never have expected her to be a shaman if you saw her in public. So after talking for a while I laid down on the bed she uses to heal her patients. She started by playing the drums and then started chanting. Nothing special was happening at the beginning. Then the emotions hit me and tears started rolling down my cheeks. I felt like I saw my inner child and saw myself for who I really was, and a tremendous burden of self-hatred, guilt, fear, and resentment was lifted. I felt like a newer, lighter person when I left, as if an old part of me had died. 

She said a few things that really stuck out which I thought I would share here. She talked about how there are two aspects of addiction: there is the void which you are trying to fill, and then there is the habit of smoking. She helped get rid of that void which was filled with insecurity, guilt, and self-hatred, and I felt like I had been reborn. Seriously. I saw my self and my suffering and all the suffering caused by others and had only compassion. And that was the main thing I learned, which is to have compassion for yourself. If you are constantly battling against yourself or putting yourself down, you will only make your life harder. The last thing she said is that if you want to break the addiction, you have to thank the plant first. No matter what you try, until you thank the plant you cannot move on. I realized it’s wrong to think that cannabis is a bad thing, or that using it is a bad thing. I learned to respect the plant and develop a relationship with it, instead of blaming it for my problems and trying to abandon it, believing that full abstinence is the key to happiness. I’m not saying you shouldn’t fully give it up, because that’s what works best for some people. But in my experience, cannabis gives me lots of things that nothing else does (I have depression, anxiety, and many other mental health problems). So instead of deluding myself into believing that I will one day miraculously throw it away and be gone with it forever, I’ve chosen to respect the plant and use it wisely and righteously. I don’t always follow my own advice and sometimes go over what I would consider to be the limit, but I’ve learned to have compassion and empathy for myself, rather than beating myself up. 

This was a pretty basic overview so if you have any more questions feel free to ask

TLDR: saw a shaman, cried a lot, and learned about compassion and forgiveness",18

2019-10-26 08:12:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dnd2xu/dont_think_of_it_as_quitting/,"Don't think of it as ""quitting""","I don't know about you guys but when I think of stopping smoking weed as ""quitting"" I can't help but feel some negative connotations associated with the word. It makes me feel like I'm admitting defeat - that weed got the better of me and forced me into submission and so by quitting I'm simply tapping out as if it's not a choice I would have otherwise wanted to make. It just doesn't seem like a solid conclusion or that there's any closure to it.

&#x200B;

I stopped for a number of reasons but it was ultimately because I wanted to, and I think that this strength of mind played into why I really didn't struggle to keep away from it. I'd ""tried"" to quit in the past, but my heart was never really in it and I felt that it was a big part of me, so even though I wouldn't smoke for a few days (big accomplishment at the time!) I'd still keep my rolling tin, my grinder, my papers, lighters, etc and I'd still hang out with the same crew of stoners before eventually caving back in to temptation. That's how far ""quitting"" got me on several occasions - I didn't really want to stop, but I knew I *had* to because of the effects I was starting to see.

&#x200B;

When I made the final, absolute decision to fully kick the habit - I didn't think of it as quitting or even stopping, as if it was some sort of journey. The journey was over - ""**I am not smoking weed... I do not smoke weed... I am not a weed smoker...**"". It just ceased to be a part of my identity and so the dissociation began. Getting rid of any traces or secret stashes of weed, binning all the paraphernalia (rolling tray, papers, grinder, etc...), deleting dealers' numbers, and gradually distancing myself from my group of friends whose entire social live revolves around smoking weed. People will be on the back foot, feeling as if you're distancing yourself because of something personal against them - you don't need to explain or justify anything, just that you've got your own shit you to focus on now.

&#x200B;

A lot of ex-weed -smokers on here mention experiencing physical withdrawal symptoms - none of which I personally experienced so I can't really comment on how to deal with those, but I'd also ask if they are actual withdrawal symptoms or just things that you didn't notice before? The only thing I really observed after stopping was having insanely vivid dreams for the first time in years, and I wasn't sure if this was an effect of the weed or just because I'd always been going to bed high or stoned so would never notice or remember my dreams the next morning. People have mentioned mood swings or getting crabby - this was something that I realised I was doing while I was smoking, usually if I'd had a long day and didn't have some weed readily available to take the edge off at the end of it. 

&#x200B;

I kicked the habit just over a year ago and honestly in the time since I've never once found myself wanting to have ""just a couple tokes, for old time's sake"". It didn't even take me long to get to the point of not liking the smell of it anymore - which until then I'd always just thought that weed has a universally nice smell even to people who don't smoke it. Even been to Amsterdam a couple of times and the thought never even crossed my mind, while back in the day I would have criticised any trip to Amsterdam as a complete waste of time and money if you didn't pop into one of the coffeeshops even if you weren't a weed smoker.

I used to think that people who didn't smoke weed were seriously missing out. That they didn't smoke it because society and the media tell them it's bad, but that they should just find out for themselves because they'd probably enjoy it. As for people who were positively or actively against it, I thought they were absolutely mental. I could never understand why people would quit, especially since ""it's nowhere near as bad as cigarettes or alcohol!"". But now I can definitely say - I get it.",3

Can you believe it's raining again!? 😮

This is about the 3rd or 4th week where it's rained every, or nearly everyday, right? 

Anyway...

I had an emotion provoking dream last night. I've wrote some notes upon waking as so I could remember the interesting parts: 

In the dream I was still with my now ex girlfriend. She was about to go home one morning and leave me alone. 

In the dream I had a rush of loneliness and anxiety kick in. Then I found a tiny amount of weed and thoughts of relapsing and going to buy weed took over my mind (this was all a dream just to make it clear).

So, a pretty scary dream. I was relieved upto waking up. Then smiled as i realised it was just a dream. ☺

So back to reality: I'm still having (mild now) night sweats. 

And reality is still a bit scary, but I'd rather feel like this than be in a full blown addiction. 

Oh yeah; i had a 20 minute run on my treadmill today. That felt amazing ☺

How's the good people of r/leaves  doing?

I imagined it to be much more difficult, as that has been the case all the times I have tried this before. This time around the first 2 weeks were a piece of cake. I had it with this drug, the night before I stoped this time, it screwed me over so bad by taking a very big opportunity away from me. I was so angry, that all I felt was pure hate for it . The last 2 weeks my semester started. I had to much s*** to do and had to get up to early, that I didn't even think about it much. Yesterday though I was with a couple of friends, who all smoke. I had a bad week in uni and also had my date for Friday skip out on me. That's why I was with the mates. I didn't have a strong urge but I knew, that for a couple hours I could be in a good mood again, if I just took a couple puffs. So I threw a coin. Heads was I smoke, tails was I don't. It landed on tails. So at least I didn't break my streak, but I felt so s**** the whole evening and probably was not a pleasure to be around. Today I feel the same. I can't cope with having to do the same s*** each week now for the next half year. I am already tense and it is only going to get worse. I am afraid, that I will not be able to handle this and the next time, the coin might decide differently. I can't even be proud of me, for not smoking yesterday, because I totally would have, if the coin had landed the other way. 

This is just random thoughts I know, but I feel kinda lost right now and had to write something down and this community is just so friendly and nice... I feel safe posting here. 

Stay strong guys!",10

As the day passes I slowly begin to sober up and feel like my mind is getting clear.
Yet as soon as I'm in a state where I can again make rational desicion the desire to smoke arises and it's almost impossible to resist? Why would I want to resist in the first place? I'm feeling great right now and should treat myself with a joint. 

But the next day I wake up with an even stronger dizziness which I just want to go get rid of as soon as possible and the cycle just continues.

It's getting harder and harder to fight against it every day. The fight really takes a huge toll as I'm in a constant battle with myself with no one being able to understand the situation in my head and able to help me. I'm also really not good at opening up to people and letting them support me.

If I stop resisting the consumption of weed will most certainly lead to a major mental breakdown, but resisting the urge leads to a deep inner struggle with constant failures, as I'm hardly able to say no.

I just needed to get rid of this, let me know if you have any advice.

All the best from Zurich",8

In the first school week I was hanging out with my old friends from my previous school on a public roof and we smoked some weed, police came and arrested 3 of my friends. Luckily I was the only one who didn't have anything on him so I was sent home.
I was arrested twice and was on probation twice and I did not want it to happen again so I hired a lawyer, it cost me 500 dollars and in the same night my phone was stolen..
In a single weekend I realized I lost my friends, my phone and all of the money I earned to enjoy during the year, and probably a clean criminal record is no longer so far from being true.
A week before starting a new school year I promised myself to smoke only on weekends, and I made it through the first week, and then I smoked with some friends and It all went to shit.
After my old friends quit smoking they just rejected me out of their social circle.
At the same time I started a new school, I started studying there two months ago and met Moran Which became a big part of my life the day we met.
And we smoked everyday since..
After losing all of my friends and starting a new school Moran was the only one there for me, and she had weed All the time.
I was in a bad place and she was the solution.
I simply became a slave to weed.
I take medication, antidepressants (prizma) and I have been arrested twice for weed, so smoking can really fuck me up.
I know I need to quit, and I also know I can't.
My life is a mess right now, I simply can't bealive how friends of four years just dumped me in a night, I'm broke as hell and I don't have friends other than Moran which smokes all the freaking time.
I'm trapped and I don't know a way out.",14

I have now seriously considered stopping.","I have a state medical card and have been getting the most incredible product from one of the few dispensaries available. I helped a good friend chop down his medicine garden recently and I have 6 Oz waiting for me as a gift, which is a great way to stop spending on this habit. But that’s not the point of my post. I want to stop using this medicine altogether, or at least enough where it is an exception instead of a rule.

When I wake up I use a Pax along with a cup of green tea, every single day. This works really well to have a great, active morning. My mood is great. But by lunch I feel such a strong urge to do it more and I indulge. Then mid afternoon, then the ritual 4:20, then right before dinner, then while washing dishes, then when the kids are in bed. Then right before lights out. Rest, repeat. It’s been this way for years. Except for long stretches of being away from home (I work in my remote office) I’m usually some degree medicated. I refuse to smoke anything, and edibles just aren’t going to work because of anxiety.

My energy sucks. I eat really clean, have maybe two cups of tea a day with some dark chocolate, but I’m tired as shit all the time. In college I’d take a 3 hour nap in the middle of the day, almost every day. I have no time for naps now. I wonder if my low energy is caused by the plant or is this just general depression of finding myself in a life of young adulthood with no way out (not that I’d want to, this is the happiest I’ve ever been). I also lost about 15 pounds in the past 18 months for seemingly no reason. My doctor says bloodwork looks fine, my thyroid is fine, and that I’ve always been thin so it’s just normal.

I really think that cannabis has become such a baseline experience of reality that any anxiety that comes from it is just part of my baseline and I don’t even know it’s upon me. Like how fish have no concept of “wet”.

For those who remember the first week stopping, what was your mood like? I feel that if I try to go without plant medicine I remind myself of the worst parts of both my mother and father, especially when dealing with the kids. It’s a part of my life now, but I know I could be applying myself to so many more worthwhile endeavors: personal, professional, and familial.

I don’t really know what I’m asking for from all y’all, but I’m ready to start slowing this thing down and making it a special treat rather than such a cornerstone of my life.",6

First time I tried it I instantly fell in love. It made me forget all my problems. Everything. It was fun. At first it was just something I did on occasion whenever I was with my friends. But occasionally eventually turned into sneaking out every night to smoke before bed. It’s made me lazy, unconcerned, made my anxiety worse, and has just made me feel foggy for the longest time. I can feel myself rotting away. Stoned on my phone all day. I used to love reading books and being a more productive person than I am now. Weed has turned into an escape for me and I’m ashamed. I’m ashamed that I’ve used it to run from my problems. I’m not even going to college or doing anything right now expect working at a dead end job. And I’m always stoned when I’m not working so I always am too lazy to do anything like enroll in school or think about what I want to do with my life. I live everyday thinking about when I can smoke again instead of setting real goals and trying to better myself. I want to take a break soo bad but I’m in too deep. I’m addicted. I guess the moral of this story is to now get consumed in drugs to escape your problems. I love weed but I just can’t keep my smoking in moderation which is fucking up my priorities. It sucks.",30

I have a very hard time falling asleep, I feel depressed and stressed, there are moments in which I feel euphoric and a hour later I’m depressed again, additionally I feel kind of high from time to time, something as a “head high” for about an hour, it comes and goes, although my head does feels “cleaner” but at the same time I’m kind of scared that I’m going crazy, as the weed fucked me over for good, which doesn’t help my mixed-weird feelings. 

It’s important for me to say that before smoking I NEVER felt like this, I slept just fine, never was depressed etc..

I'm 21 and have been smoking regularly for ~3 years now. Time seems to move on, while I stand still and enjoy the view, when the enjoying stops I roll another one. I am stuck, time isn't kind, and the responsibilities of life in our modern world are piling up. I've tried to quit many times, but eventually I always come back for more.

This time, I decided to try a new approach. There are so many things I wanna do and try out. Making a bread, learning some dance moves, building a wooden bench for in the yard, getting to know new people and rebuilding my social network which I let collect dust over the past few years, etc. 

So i decided to put these things on notes, and whenever I have free time, i go through them and just start doing one. I know I probably won't get to much enjoyment from them for a month or two, because my brain needs to adapt back to normal. But I have to hold on to the idea that it's all gonna start getting better the further I come. My friends are supportive, and I got to know some really great new friends past few months who would love to support me when things get difficult. I just need to focus on the positives I have in life right now. 

Anyways I am starting to feel selfish for blurting out all this stuff about just me. I wanna ask you, the people here who are also trying their best, who have quit for a while, who have toked one yesterday and feel horrible, who have been planning to start stopping but it just won't happen. What is your story? What helps you get through those first few months?",24

Started with regular weed, having other people roll for me. It was fun at first to feel high and giddy. 6 months in I had weed but no one to roll, so then I rolled my first blunt. 2 years in I upgraded from Reggie's to the exotic weed Sour,Kush & Haze. From then on I have not gone a day without smoking a blunt. 


After my daughter was born in 2018, I made a promise to myself that at 33 I would cut weed altogether out of my diet. I'm 32 now and my 33rd birthday is 5 months away, so I figured I'll start slowing down, I don't have income to buy as much so I started weening down.


This passed Saturday I rolled up a blunt early in the day around 2ish. Waited till 10pm to finally smoke. I'm actually praising myself because I'd probably smoke 3-5 blunts to the face a day. So I'm feeling accomplished. Not even 10 minutes after smoking I have the only anxiety attack. My chest was burning, heart beating a mile a minute. My mother died of a heart attack so I'm thinking this is the Big One. I live alone, I started freaking out called the ambulance. As soon as I sit down I start relaxing. Finally calmed down. So of course I mention to the EMT I smoked, automatically it's the weed. But in my head I'm convinced it's my heart. Get evaluated, Doctor says it's not my heart or lungs, it's probably anxiety. At first I'm like I don't suffer from anxiety. Only time I ever felt anxious or had a panic attack was when I smoked some really dank weed. Freaked out for about 5 minutes and chilled out. So it can't be that. So I decide no more weed for me. Discharged. 
Ended up smoking again, felt the same way again. Called EMS again to my house, they calmed me down didn't need to go to the hospital. 


Next day, no weed at all, not even thinking about it, watching Jets vs Pats, Boom, happened again. Called ambulance went to the hospital. Not my heart or lungs. Discharged. So now I'm still feeling these symptoms there aren't going away. But I don't know how to get rid of the burning in my chest. Stupid me smokes again, but with people. Panic attack again, so I decided to go back to the hospital. This time I have Acid reflex which is why my chest is burning.


Got discharged and ended up going home. Been home alone all day no problems. No weed. Finally a FULL day sober no weed or anything. Again it happens. I'm writing this in the hospital. I've never felt like this before, never been thru anxiety, is this withdrawals? Or is this all in my head? Can you get anxiety from quitting weed? Am I losing it because of the weed? Is this normal?

2019-10-25 00:03:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dmrzfv/running_away_from_home/,Running away from home.,"  I stopped using last May after almost 20 years of daily use. I have had a long history of health issues since I was 14 (now 40) that the doctors diagnosed as fibromyalgia, Lyme disease and recently Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (autoimmune). I started taking plaquenil for the MCTD two months ago and unbeknownst to me, the side effects are the most severe depression that I never thought possible. I was constantly thinking of death and dying and thought maybe it would go away.  I started using cannabis again which I think made things worse because it allowed me time to ruminate and get stuck in a time loop of horrific thoughts of death and dying. All I could think about is how I will die and if I should go ahead and preemptively end my suffering.  It was like the bad part of a psychedelic trip that lasted for two solid months. I quit cannabis again 7 days ago and also quit the plaquenil, so it feels like a double whammy detoxing this time. My morbid thoughts are starting to fade, but I am deep in a hole of depression that I dug for myself and I know it will take some time for things to get better. It’s only been 7 days, but I already feel a change for the better. Luckily, I have a loving and caring wife and another addiction that I can lean on to get me through this difficult time. That addiction is running. It’s hard to get out the door some days, but I know I will feel better if I go for a run than if I sit on my but and do nothing active.  The past 8 years that I’ve been running have probably been the only thing keeping me sane and alive. I know I’m just trading one addiction for another, but at least running isn’t that harmful as long as I am mindful of not overtraining. There was a time when I had a stress fracture for several months and couldn’t run, so I was severely depressed, but I was also vaping cannabis at the time, so that wasn’t helpful. 

  Tomorrow I am leaving for a 100 trail race and I’m uncertain if I will finish, but I prefer it that way. This will be the 4th time I have attempted a 100 mile race and I hope I finish, but I know it won’t be the end of the world if I fail. I’m used to failing, but I don’t look at it that way. I always learn from my failures and think to myself, “OK, now I know what not to do.”  Overcoming addiction is the hardest thing I’ve ever done and I’ve both succeeded and failed many times. Alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis and prescription meds have all come and gone in my life, but I’m still trying to improve and not fall back into old destructive habits. At least with running, the addiction is self limiting and not nearly as harmful. I know I’m just trading one addiction for another, but as long as my body will allow it, I’ll keep on truckin. 

  I will keep you all in my thoughts this weekend as I attempt this seemingly insurmountable feat of running in circles as I watch the sun rise and fall and rise again. I can always quit early and go home to my wife, but what fun would that be?  

  You are all true warriors on the path to righteousness whether you fail or succeed. It is the will to change that leads to the first step towards salvation. It gives me comfort reading these threads and knowing that I’m not the only one in this struggle.  Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories to help shepherd the weak through their darkest time. 

  ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."" - Samuel L. “Bad Mother Fucker” Jackson

And if it’s not a good day, I would’ve gotten high alone to distract myself. But today I chose to make my future my priority  and worked on homework that I normally would have procrastinated.  I put in the time to eat healthy meals. I put in 5 good hours of homework. I talked to my friend and brother on FaceTime, and talked to my boyfriend for hours over text. Normally I would’ve just gotten high and scrolled for hours. And now I have time to reflect on what I’m thankful for. I also got a lot out of Proverbs 23 today, which talks all about how wine and drunkenness can take u over. It really helped me to read that, knowing the same thing applies to any substance that fucks you up.  
I’m glad I’m already feeling more fulfilled in my life. I kept searching for answers and they were right in front of me, even though it was hard to face the truth. That I was mentally addicted to feeling high. I was using it to self sabotage and hide  forever in my immaturity. Part of me still wants to do that, but a bigger part of me knows that I need to stay strong and continue in the direction I’m going. Days 1 through 8 were so difficult. I ended up crying a lot.

If you get depressed three things you should know, 

1. Its going to happen, its okay.  Its like ""morning the loss of a 24-Year long relationship.""  This is normal with detox and recovery.  
2. Go to the gym, I can't stress this fact enough!  I didn't want to go to gym last night as some part of me wanted to stay in that depressed state! I know this sounds dumb, but its the truth!  Being high for 24 years I have felt depressed long enough!  After the gym that depressed feeling went away quickly.
3. P.A.W.S (Post Acute Withdraw Syndrome) is real.  If you smoked heavy like I did for 24 years your going to have to deal with P.A.W.S. at some point.

With P.A.W.S. as I have leaned recently your headed in the right direction as the brain is retaining itself after you quit.  If you have P.A.W.S. don't give in too old ways and DON'T give up!

What are your best tips for getting through the withdrawal?","This is going to be long- my apologies. I just need to get this out.


A little over 3 years ago, I started my gender transition from female to male. I also started smoking daily. Initially it was to cope with the immense anxiety that such a life change was causing me, and I'm grateful that I had that tool to get through it. But once I was at a stable place in my life again, I found I couldn't stop. I didn't want to stop- after years of depression and anxiety this magic drug allowed me to float through life on a cloud. I rationalized it because by societal measures, I was doing fine- better than most, in fact. I had a full-time job as a graphic designer that I loved, my own place, was paying down my debt and paying all my bills. Then back in February, my company had a massive layoff, and I was shell-shocked from being one of the ones let go. I naturally turned to my best friend weed to get me through. And what would you know, I've felt 'okay' for the last 8 months of unemployment. Even when I had to move out of my apartment and into my mom's because I could no longer afford it. Even when I was doing the bare minimum in trying to find a new job. Even as my social circle and hobbies started shrinking into oblivion. Slowly, I started to realize just how much weed had taken from me. Maybe if I hadn't smoked so much, I'd have been better at my job, and I wouldn't have been part of the layoff. Maybe I'd be in a new job by now. Maybe I wouldn't be so lonely, and would actually have friends I can turn to to get me through this. Maybe I'd still be creating art- my greatest passion in life- which I hadn't done for myself in any meaningful way since I started smoking 3 years ago. Maybe I'd have more in my portfolio to show potential employers- and all of the skills I could have learned by now to make myself a better applicant! I came to the point of wanting to be sober while high, and wanting to be high while sober, and started there for awhile. It didn't even feel good when I smoked anymore. Finally I've had enough. I smoked all of my stash, thoroughly cleaned all my paraphernalia and started on the journey towards sobriety. It's day 2, and I feel okay now, but I know it's about to get rough. I have a sensitive body, and withdrawal tends to hit me hard. But I'm determined to make it through.


So, what tips do y'all have for getting through the worst of it? What are your quitting stories?",7

But today it struck me that it can totally be my breakup song for weed! I know Selena's music isn't everyone's fave, but it's a nice song. Here are some of the lyrics that really spoke to me:

&#x200B;

**You promised the world and I fell for it**

**I put you first and you adored it**

**Set fires to my forest**

**And you let it burn**

&#x200B;

**I saw the signs and I ignored it**

**Rose-colored glasses all distorted** 

**Set fire to my purpose** 

&#x200B;

**I needed to lose you to find me**

**This dance, it was killing me softly**

**I needed to hate you to love me**  


&#x200B;

I guess you could technically make any breakup song about weed if you really want to lol 

It feels cathartic to mourn the relationship I had with weed, which I didn't do during my first attempt at quitting. I'm on my 4th day without the ganj and crying often! So it's great background music for a good bawling sesh :)

One thing that comes to mind is my weed habit. I’d constantly feel the need to be high around her. If I wasn’t high then I’d get irritable or just shut down easily when we were together. This made her mad as it kept on happening and nothing seemed to change with me.

Even more than that, I had made weed my life up to this point. All my “friends” from high school still smoke and when I’m with them the habit feels fine. But over time it has prevented me from my potential. I haven’t developed any hobbies, feel emotionless and lacked in social intelligence. I always noticed a similar patter with other people but mine was worse.

It was a shock to meet someone who didn’t encourage me to smoke. Who didn’t need it to have fun and be around me. She would be sober and enjoy my presence even if we were just watching shows. At the time I was like, that’s dumb I’d rather be high to watch movies. But looking back I wish I could’ve had sober memories around her. 

She made me realize that weed addiction is real and that I could meet people who were potheads. She had been around people her whole life who didn’t smoke everyday. Maybe sometimes but not as much as I did. She even smoked weed before but felt like she didn’t enjoy it much. I tried to quit for her near the end but I think it was too late. 

She was tired of me saying I’d take a break or quit weed. In my mind I wanted to but I just ended up going back to it. She ended up losing hope I guess. That this person is supposed to be my future partner and he doesn’t seem like it at all. I was immature. 

Now that I’m broken I want to quit so badly. I wish I could quit, improve my life and hope she gives me another chance. Because I had love for her and the weed got in the way of expressing that. She always deserved better and I want to be a better person for her. But I am not sure if she’ll take me back.",3

What's important, for me, is that with this girl I noticed I had absolutely wrecked most interesting things I do, because I smoke weed instead of doing them now.

I used to absolutely just binge information on the internet, just to learn new shit. I don't anymore, and when I do, I do it high and don't remember the details of what I learned.

I used to be a huge cinephile. I still watch movies, but I watch them high, and don't remember the details well enough to discuss it.

I've always been very into martial arts, all way back since I was a kid. Started training Karate around 10 years old. Currently doing BJJ. The problem? I keep skipping classes now, because of brain fog and ""eugh, just wanna go home and get high"".

I used to run my own business on the side. I still technically do, but I'm high all the time and don't do anything with it (apart from just thinking) anymore.

What about art and design? I have a Masters in this, used to draw a lot, paint a lot, etc.. Haven't done either for around 7 years now.

Travel used to be incredibly important for me. It's what I would save up money for, by default. It was THE thing for me. But now, I spend so much money on weed throughout the year, that I don't have money to travel anymore.

I used to run one or two half-decent YouTube channels, but I don't anymore. Why? A) worried about saying shit that can be problematic with work in the future, and B) it actually takes effort to get going, which I provide zero of.

What do I actually do with my time? I get depressed I'm not doing anything with my life right now, then I go buy weed to forget that I'm not doing anything with life right now, then I get high and CAN'T actually do anything productive, usually end up playing simple games (like Hearthstone or such) and watching a ton of pornography. Then I wake up next morning anxious that I didn't get anything done, get depressed, the cycle continues.

I used to have big opinions on politics, philosophy, religion, morals, international matters, all these things. And now? Eh, I just don't care that much. I don't read or watch the news anymore. My head is foggy and takes longer to think of the point I'm trying to make. Since I'm high so much, I often forget the details of what I read/saw/thought previously.

&#x200B;

 

Keep on setting the intention in yourself to quit and continually remind yourself that its actually a wonderful thing to stop. You might feel mad because you feel like you're missing out, or in some way you're still attached to weed. Find out where that attachment lies, and what it is. For me I was attached to the feelings i would get from listening to music while high and that kept on sucking me back in. In the past I would be upset because i felt like i was missing out on the great feelings.. But reframe your perspective and it will be easier.

The fact is you're here because some part of you feels like your life would be better without it. For me I had to seriously remind myself of all of the great opportunities and doorways that would open for me with sobriety. I thought of all of the things Ive been missing out on from being high all the time. When you flip it on its head like that (rather than feeling like youre missing out on getting high) and seriously find a reason to rejoice in sobriety, you are dissolving the attachment to weed.

For me now when theres an urge or a thought comes up like ""oh i could get high right now"" i force myself to think ""no, weed does nothing for me anymore. i have used every ounce of benefit from weed, it has served its purpose. I no longer have anything to gain from weed, but i have EVERYTHING to gain from sobriety.I will gain clearer thought processes, easier time socializing, easier time planning and following through with what i TRULY want in my life, i will gain self-respect and a sense of accomplishment for finally doing what i know i must do.""

And by the time i remind myself of the fact that this is LITERALLY ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS I CAN BE DOING FOR ME, the urge is gone. Because i evoke the legitimate emotion of rejoicing. And, friend, Im sure you have used up weeds benefit long ago. You're here after all.

This process of rejoicing is much easier than gritting your teeth and forcing yourself to stop when in the back of your mind you think you're still missing out on something. Write yourself a list of all the things you gain from getting high and be honest. Really see if theres something you think you still gain from it. Then write a list of all the things you will gain from sobriety.

I am only 9 days in this time around, but it has been the most easy and even enjoyable process for me because I have solidified it in myself to look forward to a wonderful, beautiful future for myself. For the record, it took many many many attempts to quit for me. Which is why I say continue to set the intention to quit and even if you slip, set the intention again. It will click for you, I promise.

And as a side note, since my attachment to music while high was a big one for me, I was pleasantly surprised to see my emotional response to music skyrocketed, rather than being half-there stoned out of my mind trying to recreate the same feelings of when I first listened to music while stoned. If the attachment to some pleasure of media (ie: tv, video games, music) is still there consider the fact that, assuming youve been getting high for years, it will actually be more pleasurable when you're sober. Because thats the great news, it will be. You will be refreshed and satisfied to see you will enjoy everything you enjoyed while high to an even higher degree. Because you will be truly present with the media you like.

Best of luck, much love, and dont beat yourself up for failing. You WILL get this. You WILL get the life you deserve, free of the insidious plant that has held you down for so long.",223

I'm working a dead end service job and I realized that I need to learn an actual skill so that I don't have to worry about the whims of a boss when I have no plan B.

I started thinking about how even something as simple as expecting anesthesia during a dental procedure is just an extraordinary luxury. Every time I go the dentist I think, ""I sure am glad I don't live in the middle ages where they would have to just pull teeth out or let them rot with no pain reliever."" Tonight I realized I AM still living in that world, it's only because of complex societal systems(education, people willing to be dentists, the production/transportation of the numbing agents, a method of paying for it all) that I'm able to have that pampering. I guess I'm starting to feel gratitude for subtler things that I never would have noticed while I was smoking.

2019-10-24 00:23:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dmb921/weird_experience_at_the_psychiatrists_office_day_7/,Weird experience at the psychiatrist's office (Day 7),"Hey folks. This is my first post-- I wanted to do a proper introduction and tell a bit of my story, but I also had a weird experience today at the psychiatrist's office and I was hoping you could lend me and ear and tell me what you think. I'm know I'm quite long-winded, but I hope some of you will be willing to read this and talk with me.

I've smoked cannabis recreationally since my senior year of high school, but it was 8 years ago that I started becoming a daily, heavy smoker. I didn't realize it until recently, but I have been using marijuana to self-medicate for a variety of ailments. I first started using heavily after ending a relationship with a long-term ex-bf and coming out of the closet as gay, and I am still recovering from the trauma and sexual abuse of that relationship. I've been in therapy for 7 years, and over the course of that journey I've come to recognize that I have C-PTSD stemming from my childhood with my narcissistic mother and worsened via my narcissist ex-bf, as well as depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I've known I've had depression for years and I've been doing a lot of trauma work especially in the last three (can't recommend brainspotting/EMDR enough! so much healing!!), but it wasn't until this year that I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. I never suspected I had either disorder because I've always been seen as a bright but spacey girl who was good in school and could handle her shit.... but on the inside I was an anxious, scattered mess barely holding it together, constantly dissociating and daydreaming to deal with my trauma.

Pot \~seemed like\~ the perfect medication for me because it could help me chill. the. fuck. out. and also the right sativa could trigger my hyperfocus and get me to engage in productive activities that I had previously felt too depressed to attempt (mostly cleaning and organizing... fuck, I LOVED reorganizing my art room or my spice drawer after getting stoned. What a weird way to spend countless fucking hours). It helped me stay numb to my trauma, kept my brain foggy enough to let a bunch of those memories stay repressed, made me feel like dancing when I was depressed, made wasting time on the internet feel like \~doing interesting research\~... it didn't solve any of my mental disorders and it certainly didn't help me heal from them, but it did help me fucking COPE. I've been able to survive these past years because marijuana has kept me afloat, but it's been like sitting in a little ring buoy in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I was still stranded in the MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING OCEAN, but at least I wasn't drowning, eh?

Once I realized I was using marijuana to help medicate alllll these disorders, I thought to myself that it would probably be a good idea try getting medicated with some actual meds. I felt deeply dependent on marijuana and it was having a lot of adverse effects on my life. After (shorter and shorter) bouts of hyperfocus, I would swing towards lethargy, apathy, and self-hatred, and my creativity felt sapped from me. I'd feel numb and dissociative and I was always relying on another bowl to get me back ""up"" and make me feel energized and alive again. It became an endless cycle, and the additional physiological symptoms of being a heavy smoker (morning stomach pain and nausea) meant that getting high always meant escaping something that felt bad and running towards something that felt good, until the good feelings faded and I needed to chase them again.

I trialed a couple different medications until I ultimately found quite a significant bit of relief from taking a combination of sertraline (zoloft) for anxiety and amphetamine salts for ADHD (adderall). I started to be able to handle my shit a little bit better and move my life forward in small but significant ways. It felt so good to finally admit to myself that I had been medicating all along with pot and that I clearly couldn't cope without medicating, and to seek a more effective medication with less life-sapping side effects. My mental health was improving, but pot still had a grip on my life, and despite being treated with medications, I was still self-medicating with smoking. I decided on a very significant anniversary that I needed to finally change my relationship with smoking and face my mental health recovery sober. I needed to fully feel my emotions, process my trauma, and move on from this phase of my life. I was done merely surviving. I wanted to thrive.

So, a week ago I quit smoking. And OH MY GOD.

I HAD NO IDEA WHAT AN ANXIOUS MESS I AM.

I'm getting an entirely different picture of my mental health now that I'm not smoking. My anxiety is through the roof (my partner called it ""debilitating""). I am being bombarded by repressed memories. I feel awful inside of my body and I can't escape it. My anxiety is manifesting in all sorts of nervous, fidgety behavior, from wiggling toes and gnawing on my lip to picking scabs on my scalp and chewing on my fingers. I've been dealing with intense night sweats and insomnia because of withdrawals as well. Mostly, I've noticed I seem to completely lack the ability to self-soothe. I feel like a bundle of nerves. After the first couple days I told my partner, ""No wonder I smoke all the fucking time, BEING ME FEELS FUCKING UNBEARABLE."" I hope some of this stuff tapers off as the withdrawals peter out, but I think some of the stuff... might just be regular, old, anxious, sober me.

I went to see my psychiatrist today to discuss my medications because now that I'm not self-medicating with pot alongside them, I'm realizing that my meds aren't doing enough to help me cope. We ultimately decided to increase my dosage of sertraline and see how that goes, but my appointment was really weird......

........ I started to tell my psychiatrist about all of the symptoms I was experiencing now that wasn't smoking weed and that my anxiety was at an all time high. He knitted his brow and looked at me in confusion. He asked me why I didn't want to smoke anymore if it had been helping me with my anxiety (note: I live in a state where it's legal). I started listing off all the ways that pot was negatively impacting my life, and he kept looking at me skeptically with his knitted brow. I told him that I know pot is a great solution for a lot of people, but I felt like I was abusing it and it was negatively impacting my life. He suggested trying a 1:1 CBD:THC and I said no, I really feel like I don't have a healthy relationship with pot and that I didn't want to keep using it.

I recalled during our intake session a couple months prior I had been a couple days sober off of weed and told him that I was addicted to weed, abused the substance, and was experiencing heavy withdrawals in the form of night sweats and racing thoughts. During that intake he had told me, ""I don't think that's weed, I think that is just your baseline anxiety."" He has also said, ""Weed isn't weed isn't weed, and you're probably just smoking the wrong strain and that's giving you even more anxiety."" That convinced me to quit my sobriety and try smoking a heavy indica before bed instead of my euphoric, energetic sativas..... all it did was lead to yet another weeks/month long smoking binge.

I usually like this doc and have had good experiences with him in the past, but I feel like today he treated me SUPER weirdly when I brought up being addicted to marijuana again. He seemed incredulous the whole time and acted like I was being confusing in my reasoning. He didn't ask me a lot of follow up questions and didn't make a lot of commentary or provide suggestions as I was listing off all my symptoms. Our appt only lasted 15 minutes instead of the usual 30, and when I left his office I felt incredibly awkward. I felt like I had stumbled upon my psychiatrist's own bias and he was unwilling to admit or believe that marijuana addiction is real and can cause turmoil in a person's life, despite everything I had said and also, y'know, EXPERIENCED. After I left, I realized he didn't even ask me how often or how much I smoked. He had come across as uncurious, incredulous, and judgmental. I called my partner immediately after and shared the whole story, getting emotional. My partner said, ""It sounds like you know how you feel, you know your experiences, and you know how this is impacting your life. He doesn't. Just because he has a degree doesn't mean he's free from bias, and just because he thinks he knows what's going on with you doesn't make him an expert in your own life.""

The fucked up part is while 90% of my brain was saying, ""hey! yeah! he's wrong! I have a problem and I need HELP"", 10% of my brain was going, "".... hey. maybe this guy is right. he is a doctor. smoking does help with my anxiety.... maybe I could just go to the dispensary and--""

But I know that's the addicted part of my brain talking. Because I AM ADDICTED. I have enough life experience with pot to see that by now. But that experience rattled me. It made me feel ungrounded. It disturbed me that I was putting my own mental health and CHEMISTRY of my FUCKING BRAIN in someone else's hands and now that person wasn't treating me as a credible source. I feel gaslit. I have had SUCH a strong resolve to quit this time and have been really working to take care of myself and my life, and I feel like that resolve has been shaken a little by this encounter. I'm still sober, and I still want to be sober, and I also want to find a way to manage my debilitating anxiety and inability to complete anything due to my ADHD. There is so much in my life I need to work on and move forward, and pot has been a hindrance to all of that.

Most importantly, I want to feel alive. And when I'm stoned and apathetic, I feel like I want to slip away and hide forever. On my fourth day sober, I woke up sticky and covered in sweat, but with the most fantastic dream still dancing in my head. I had been in a dark room with all the lights off, holding a baby, and I had the awareness that someone, somewhere was looking at the moon, and wanted me to show the baby the moon so they could be looking at it at the same time. I took the baby over to the window and we stared out at the crescent moon glowing in the sky. My partner was beside me and put their arm around my waist. Suddenly, the sky began to fill with the most beautiful, vivid images of indigenous art, just the most gorgeous, detailed, expressive art all dancing in the night sky. Suddenly the sun began to rise into the scene. It looked like a stunning depiction from an illuminated manuscript, with wide golden rays reaching across the sky. The moon and the sun shone together in the sky as this breathtaking tapestry of human art and expression sparkled between them. I felt so happy, so overcome with emotion. ""It is so beautiful,"" I said out loud in the dream as we all held each other. ""We are so blessed. We are so, so lucky to be alive."" When I awoke those words kept ringing in my head.

We are so lucky to be alive.

We are so lucky to be alive.

We are so lucky to be alive.

We are alive.

We are alive.

I'm done with smoking.

I'm alive.",8

I haven't been around much because I've been relapsing... I was doing so well, but then I couldn't get through two weeks without ""rewarding"" myself. And then when I was experiencing some undesired turbulence in my love life, I baked for a week straight. And last Monday, I realized I couldn't do this alone anymore, or just with /leaves-- as great as it is, I realized that I needed to be in a room with \*actual\* people to keep me accountable for this shit. I've been trying to do it on my own for almost 3 years, and I finally realized I can't quit alone.   


I actually went to some AA meetings last week, simply because there are so many of them (I live in NYC and there are literally dozens of AA a day), and MA only meets a few times that conflicted with either work or another 12-step fellowship I go to (ACA, Adult Children of Alcoholics... great group, highly recommend if that's something that resonates with you). I really liked AA too (particularly for its structure and focus on the 12 steps + principles), and while I'll still go to the open meetings NA was great because I could actually talk about my relationship to weed in particular.   


You know, I don't really want to quit. Honestly, right now I'd like nothing more than to blaze up and jam out with my keyboard while riding on this new wave of creative inspiration that's coming to me. But I'm so sick of relapsing... I'm so sick of feeling ashamed. I'm so sick of starting my sober count over again, and over again. I'm so sick of covering up my problems with this shit.  


Big fan of 12-step work. It seems culty at first, but you work your own program and the Higher Power stuff is actually fucking magical.

Hey ents! I’ve been smoking pretty much every day for the past two and a half years and ever since a month ago, every time I smoke my heart starts pounding and it even gets to the point where my left arm starts to feel numb. I would like to point out that this never happens when I’m sober, and I may have a pinched nerve on the very same arm. I also have untreated anxiety and my life has been pretty stressful these past few months and I have a feeling it’s just the anxiety being amplified by cannabis. But in the moment and even while I’m sober I can’t shake the feeling that this is a warning sign for something much more serious and I don’t want to die after smoking a bowl and know there was something I could do to prevent it. (I know it sounds ridiculous to me as I’m typing this) Idk if it matters but I’m 6’2 and around 130lbs and I live a very sedentary lifestyle at the moment. The whole point of this is to see if anyone else has some similar experience because it’s gotten to the point where I’m ready to quit for a while, I just don’t understand how something that used to help me with my anxiety now only makes it worse and has physical effects on my body.

Still kind of depressed....WHY?,"22 days ago I started this sober living journey after 24 years high and in the clouds, to say its been good so ""NO REGURTS"". Got through the worst of withdraws, not eating, not sleeping, vivid dreams, oddball cravings, crying, headaches, dizziness, and tension.

Today while I'm working I feel depressed and even little moody. Everybody around me loves the new me as I am completing projects in a fast and efficient way then ever before.  My libido is good, wife's happier in that department now.

This depressed and moody feeling I can't quite wrap my head around. I have no reason to be depressed with all the change that's healthy and good in my life now.  I'm going to the gym daily with a buddy so why am I so depressed today. My oldest son tells me ""I am still withdrawing from weed.""  Is this true for people who are on 22+ days clean?",33
2019-10-23 19:04:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dm7h2c/quit_but_qol_has_dropped_dramatically_wait_it_out/,"Quit, but QoL has dropped dramatically. Wait it out, or?","I have been using cannabis for about 6 years to help me cope with Anxiety as well as some pretty severe migraine issues.  I have a Dr's prescription for this, and have been seeing the Dr for many years on follow-ups.  It helps to numb my overthinking mind, and never really felt that it hindered my productivity or daily habits.  If anything it helped and I have had a noticeable QoL improvement.  However, smoking has always been a concern, and recently my teenage kids found my waterpipe and I had to have a conversation with them on why Dad smokes weed.  They were understanding, but I felt a bit disappointed in myself that I couldn't find better coping mechanisms to deal with Anxiety and my overthinking mind.  I do also use oils/edibles but often turn to smoking because it kicks in faster and is way cheaper than the alternatives.  Also tried vaporizing but this wasn't for me (had throat issues I think due to it).

Before I turned to weed I did have great results with mindfulness and meditation, ran through the MBSR program and I would definitely recommend it.  However, with time I found this too also faded and with my blood pressure spiking to unhealthy levels decided to give Cannabis a shot. I wasn't a daily user before I started, only trying weed here and there, but since I had become a daily user and more recently noticed that due to the tolerance levels I had built up I was consuming about 1oz in little over 3 weeks.  Also, even though I had been smoking \~20-25% THC levels I hardly felt 'high' anymore.  I use a 1:1 ratio of CBD and THC normally.

So day 7 of being sober here now, and I have to say that my life is turning to shit.  I'm sleeping more hours, but feeling more tired.  I can't get up to meditate because I'm absolutely exhausted even on 9 hours of sleep, where my average was 5-6 before.  I exercise almost daily, but since quitting I have only been twice, and both times were the most lackluster gym sessions I've had in quite some time.   I'm absolutely miserable again, and the anxiety levels are spiking so bad I'm finding it really difficult to cope day-to-day.  I was on SSRI's before, but they weren't for me as they brought on some pretty harsh depression in the first two weeks and I'm not a depressed person normally.  I want to turn back to weed, but I'm also telling myself to stick it through that this will pass and that this may just be a result of withdrawals.  However, I'm not so certain.  Thankfully I haven't had a migraine yet.

So tonight I'm trying to outweigh the pro's and con's of staying off, but the cons are definitely winning.  Anyone else been in the same situation and want to share their story, or can offer any advice to me?  I want to be a good role model for my kids, and I'm fearful about what cannabis smoke is doing to my body.  Outside of this, I don't have many objectives for wanting to quit.",5

I don't feel confident anymore. I don't meditate. The more I use it, the worse it gets. 
I don't know how to stop and I'm going insane!!!
How can I just stick to the process?",3

Evenings are the most tough. Just need to make it through 3 days and then it’s smoother sailing for me.

I had the tinniest bit left and i invited a mate round he brought his weed out i felt kinda bad so i had to take mine out. We ended up smoking about 1.5grams yesterday :(.

Clearly i have no self of control. But im talking to friends about it and its helping. I need weed subconsciously still. 

Me and my roommate got a hamster so that should be a better distraction then weed. I am not feeling as lazy as before because I actually got up at 9am today and i feel like im sorting some stuff out but at a slow pace.

It helps to write things out that im thinking about so its easier for me to process what just happened. Weed makes me pretty dumb. Or just not give a shit about things. But my actions do have consequences in my life and the struggle is real.

Although its not actually my day 2 i feel like writing about the process can show people its not a thing you can do straight away it is gradual.

I have actually cried a lot over the last 2 days, I can't stop thinking about all my troubles, I have been writing again which I think it's good. My partner says I am actually processing again. 

I think I want to keep this going, i think I need to talk to my doctor. 

Anyway, I just wanted to vent this to a group that can understand me. I don't have many people in my life who can understand this, most of my mates still smoke up apart from one. They have been super helpful and supportive plus my partner too.

2019-10-23 01:34:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dluqh7/mind_of_an_addict_day_2/,Mind of an Addict: Day 2,"Hey all, I’m back with another daily update. [Here is my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dlbsuh/mind_of_an_addict_day_1/) so you know what I’m talking about. Well, it’s Day 2 while being a daily smoker for over a year and a half, so how am I feeling? I’ll break down **each withdrawal** I’ve experienced today and **each piece of humanity** I’ve gained back, too.

**Withdrawals**:

* **Insomnia** began last night. Somehow, I managed to get 4-5 hours of sleep in. When I tried taking tolerance breaks in the past, I wasn’t able to fall asleep for the first couple nights until 5am, so I was pleasantly surprised to get some rest.
* **Excessive sweating/high body temperature** made me extremely uncomfortable today. The worst part was that it was above 90F degrees today and the air was particularly dry, so this made me even more uncomfortable.
* **My anxiety “attacks”** became stronger today. I put “attack” in quotes because they were not full-blown panic attacks: they were those brief moments that we experience throughout the day whereby one becomes adequately anxious for a short period of time. For example, I saw my crush today and before I approached her to hang out with her, my anxiety was through the roof like never before and I was sweating like crazy. I was able to overcome this moment by being patient with myself and reinforcing in my head ""you DON'T have to talk to her"" today. That thought made me feel a lot better. And the minute I felt better, I decided to just go for it immediately and not give my mind time to get anxious again.
* **Cravings to smoke** were beginning to creep in today. But here’s something MAGICAL I figured out: figure out what kind of marijuana addict you are! For example, [as you saw in my first journal](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dlbsuh/mind_of_an_addict_day_1/), my go-to smoking medium was rolling a tobacco blunt. I found that hitting my friend’s water vapor device last year when I was trying to quit helped immensely with the process. This is because half of my smoking addiction was the actual “action” of smoking: bringing something to my mouth, taking a drag, having my lungs fill up, and exhaling the smoke out. I made sure that my friend’s vape was water vapor only so that I wasn’t replacing THC with nicotine or any other nasty chemicals. So today, when my cravings were kicking in, I thought about the revelation I had last year about the “action” part of my addiction. Here’s what I did: I closed my eyes and thought to myself, “Could this craving be filled with a couple puffs from a water vaporizer?” And the answer was YES. This realization alone calmed me down and reinforced the idea that my marijuana addiction is still *completely psychological* and that the “action” of putting something to my mouth and taking a drag of anything is what I was actually craving in my moment. Now, will this be the same for someone who typically takes bong rips or takes edibles? This could be different. But I wanted to share my thoughts about this.

**Pieces of Humanity**:

* You know when you wake up and a song is implanted in your head already? Or is it just me? Either way, 5 minutes after waking up today, **a bunch of old memories began to flood my mind** (and it’s only Day 2). On top of that, one song came back into my head today after not remembering it for over a decade: it was some music video my mom  always played for me when I was about 6 years old. This was such a cool feeling! I attribute this to quitting because every time I had quit in the past (temporarily), my mind began to flood with old memories and distant thoughts that I have had at some point my life but haven’t thought about in YEARS. This was my favorite part of today.
* Today, **I was stringing sentences together more efficiently** than I’ve done before. Additionally, I was stringing in academic vocabulary into my speech effortlessly, using words that I would never have used before. I sounded a lot smarter today! This felt very good.
* We all have anxious/upsetting thoughts that pass through our mind. But as a stoner, these thoughts took such a huge toll on my self confidence. But today, **as these same thoughts passed through per usual (e.g. embarrassing memories) I didn’t have a strong reaction anymore**. Yes, the thoughts are still embarrassing and demoralizing, but I was able to respond maturely without any effort. This is HUGE for me! If you’re anything like me, anxiety dictates my life and today it had significantly less control over me. Please note: I still felt anxiety today as a whole, meaning I still had the chemical imbalance in my blood and thus felt INCREDIBLY shitty still. However, those little thoughts that usually trigger anxiety attacks for me did not do so today. I just wanted to clarify this.
* **I had way fewer mood swings today**. I felt more level headed tackling my day even though today was very difficult.
* **I felt less depressed today**. I can’t really describe depression: it’s like living in a cloud where you hate yourself while being paralyzed inside of your own mind. Today, I felt less paralyzed and thus, better than yesterday.

These are all incremental improvements. But I’m telling you… they really outweigh the withdrawals I faced today. Here are my MOST SUCCESSFUL tips for getting through withdrawals:

&#x200B;

* You KNOW what anxiety feels like. When it’s Day 1, Day 2 or Day 3 and your blood begins to have that chemical imbalance that makes you feel shitty (anxiety), RECOGNIZE it. Tell yourself *out loud* what’s happening. Get out of your head.
* Like I just said, get out of your head. Many people in r/leaves tell you to “distract yourself” or to “keep yourself busy” while quitting, and I feel like that’s the right idea but it's delivered in a bad way. Think about it this way: do ANYTHING that involves physical activity. Yes, exercising is great (and is the best coping mechanism for quitting, in my opinion) but what I mean is for you to do anything physical with your body. TV is a really bad distraction: you’re stuck in your head. Instead, **go on a brisk walk**. Knit something with your hands. Go wash your face. Socialize with someone. Paint. THROW ROCKS IN AN EMPTY ALLEY. Do something physical. These are the best distractions. Activities like listening to music and playing video games are stimulating, yes. But
* The easiest way to fuck yourself over when quitting is to substitute marijiuana with another substance, so PLEASE be weary with this advice: if you’re already a crazy coffee drinker like me, go have some caffeine. It’s a stimulant. It actually makes me feel better. But seriously, do NOT overdo it or it could stop working for you as a benefit. Allow yourself one to two cups of caffeine a day but don’t consume more than three.

Thanks for reading! Please comment and talk to me about your journey! I want to hear from you guys. Everyone has a perspective that’s valuable for everyone else on this subreddit. You guys are amazing <3.",4

2019-10-23 00:57:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dlue7w/i_need_to_harden_up_take_responsibility_for_my/,I need to harden up. Take responsibility for my life!,"22/F been smoking weed/tobacco all day everyday since I was 13. I managed to quit for 10 days last month, partied my face off while sober and slumped back into smoking every day feeling ashamed. I have no control over myself. I sobered up from weed and replaced it with nose drugs, and then I relapsed on weed feeling like I just couldn't win. I just couldn't face myself sober. I'm having some realizations.

I need to take control over my life. This is a choice. Only I am accountable for my actions and I need to hold myself as such. Nobodys going to take the joint away from me and nurse me back to normalcy. This is a fight I need to fight every damn day. I need to stop being content with this mediocrity. it's not enough. i jog my lazy 5k every morning stoned but i can do better than that. I'm able bodied. I'm healthy. I'm extremely lucky and i'm taking it for granted, asking for lung cancer with spliffs while i could be challenging myself and being the best version of me. Making good choices is HARD. We need to embrace the hard things. Harden up.

I've wasted an incredible amount of the last 8 years staring into space, staring into my computer, forgetting who I really am. Weed took away my choices. I haven't been able to CHOOSE not to smoke weed for 8 years. I gave it all of my power. It's a big comfy duvet that perfectly stretched over and softened the hard ridges of my life. Now I haven't met sober me since I was 13, and the glimpses I have gotten of her haven't been very pleasant, and I certainly don't trust her to operate myself without some serious self work and discipline. I commit now to putting in this effort to discipline my estranged sober self. No more 5 party benders when I quit weed.

If, in my sobriety, I'm not strong enough to find pleasure in the things I'm doing, then I will embrace this and find suffering in something hard instead. This suffering will inevitably cause pleasure, or at the very least, relief, when subsided. (I mean suffering as in working out/pushing myself to do math for longer, btw, not like, self harming suffering)

I want to turn that 5k into a 10k - eventually into a marathon. keep pushing. I need to stop settling for less than what I'm physically and mentally capable of. I want the same satisfaction I get from smoking to be from my achievements through the day. Not some bullshit work achievements - I want to feel good about making myself better than I was yesterday. I want to get good at things.

I'm going to take my own advice this time. Feeling uncomfortable is a gift. It allows us to analyze ourselves and our reactions. It challenges us to face and overcome them. I'm going to embrace feeling uncomfortable. Grow the fuck up from it. i'm sick of being a controlled baby. This stops here.

I'm going to discipline myself. As of tomorrow morning, I'm not a smoker anymore. No weed or tobacco. Wake up at 6am, do yoga, and run 10k. I'm writing this because it feels motivational. Sorry for the rant.

This is the last joint. It's over.",33

 Little background, i went to therapy 10 months ago during christmass time for a whole 21 days thats i finished. Sadly i relapsed on weed.10 days out. But that therapy made me realise a lot of things and made me stop speed and alchool but weed stayed with me. Somehow i wasn’t hating her as much as i would and truthfully i may have mentally planned that relaps in advance knowing how weak to resist i would be to the plant. 

This weekend i snaped. Started reading all the post around here. Installed Grounded, which i find fantastic, and went from there. I tried to curtail the early temptation by stoping cigarettes. Might have worked but i went back to it a day later. But still no weed :-) 

Now guys, how much sleepless nights should i expect from this? In therapy i was medicated for the first 10 days, not now. But i’m motivated more than ever. I never felt that focus on stoping and never that serious. 

Cheers guys! Stay strong! Calm, collected, present, focused and GROUNDED!

2019-10-22 20:23:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dlr6of/day_1_no_weed/,Day 1 - No weed," My journey with weed began all the way back when I was 15 in England. Back then it was just something I would do with friends occasionally. It was fun, and I never thought much of it. Meanwhile, high school was tough, I was bullied, and I know that this took a toll on me. Once I graduated, I had no plans for college and just wanted a change of environment. My first option was to move to the USA and live with my Dad (parents divorced when I was 6). At the time I thought things were going well, a new environment, the change I craved. I was running away from the stress. I had no self-esteem, and I just wanted to fit in. I had an accent, and it was my wish to speak like everyone else so I wouldn’t stand out. Whilst trying to fit in, weed came into my life again. It was just like I was 15 again, but this time I was smoking a lot more. I got a job at this cleaning company; the environment was relaxed which eased a lot of my anxiety. I got myself into college and finally; I thought I was really going in the right direction. I majored in psychology because I have always been that guy who everyone comes to for advice when I was the one who truly needed it. I loved the idea of helping others and to this day I hold on to that. Up until this point, I wasn’t buying my supply and I never even fathomed doing that. The risk, what if I get caught, I just couldn't. Two years pass, and I have my associate’s degree and I was pleased with my achievement. This was around the same time I smoked on a more regular basis. I would buy around twice a month, wasting all the money I could have been saving. Again, it was fun and at the time I truly believed weed was the cure to everything. I would tell myself I smoked through college and got honors, what could stop me. Fast forward, to the beginning of 2019, I had just graduated with my bachelors and I started making plans for the future. Yes, I was still cleaning at the same company making the same shitting money, because that was the easy option. I convinced myself that no other job was as convenient settling for less because of my fear of change. Oh yea, my boss was a jerk and constantly gave me a hard time but would never fire me because deep down they believed nothing would make me leave. This was my turning point, and I had enough. No more stifling my dreams with feelings of inadequacy. As my story ends, I realized after so many years I have a lot of social anxiety. Recently every time I smoke weed it has been making me anxious. I just can’t anymore, and I won’t let it be a hindrance in my recovery. 

Sorry for the long post. If anyone has been through a similar story, feel free to leave a comment below. Another reason I need to stop this habit is because I left the cleaning company and found a job in social work.

I was planning for a while to do one post about my progress, about the changes I feel since, about hardships of quitting and what are my plans going forward.

I've been smoking for the past 5 years, I have smoked very regularly, and daily for the past year, about a gram a day. I have been praising and enjoying weed for the longest time, oblivious to the facts that it has been poisoning my life, my relationships, my hobbies and my physical and mental health.

But 28 days ago I've decided that I've had enough. This is my 3rd time quitting, but the one I felt most successful and right about. The first time I tried to quit was early this year and I lasted about 3 weeks, second time I only lasted a week, which was super discouraging to try again. I came to terms that I am a stoner and that I need weed like I need other things in life and it's cool to smoke and it's a part of me. I learned later that I was wrong and that it was nothing but me convincing myself to not try hard enough to alter myself. Now I am not saying that weed sucks and everyone should quit, but probably if you're reading this, then you are already considering to change yourself - so maybe this is for you.

Unlike the first two times, this time I knew that I am done, I felt like I can do it and I know why I was doing it - I wasn't doing it for people around me, but because I was ready for the next step in life. I've done significant changes in my life before, like picking up learning music instruments somewhat late into my life, losing a lot of weight by having a healthier lifestyle, things like that. I know I can do it if I have the right attitude, motivation and goals. And I love nothing more in life than the sense of progress and change in me. Not that I am trying to be happier, but I want to experience more of life, and I've realized that weed was not letting me do that. Maybe not so much weed, but me being high. I would choose to stay home and get baked over going out for a social event, doing something productive like exploring my hobbies or getting in touch with friends and family with whom I could not talk while I was high for the fear of them finding out.

Now when I quit, the first couple of days were a bit tough. I still knew what I was doing and why, so I had my motivation, but coming home from work and not having the usual routine of eating some junk after getting high and watching a movie or a TV show threw me a bit. I still had to do the same things but without the weed making everything more enjoyable. Except a week later I quickly realized it barely makes a difference. I am still enjoying my life just as much, even more in fact, with all the negatives gone that stoners usually don't talk about, like lack of decent sleep, lack of dreams, increased anxiety and avoiding socialization.

What helped me a lot and something I suggest, is trying to figure out why you're quitting and focus on it. For me it was music - I know that smoking was getting in the way of me practicing music instruments I've just recently picked up, and ever since I quit I've been creating music and I am now getting to work on some interesting projects with friends that I would not interact with as much before. I think a lot of us try to quit but don't actually have a clear purpose or goal set in mind, so inevitably fail, and then make it harder to try again for the fear of failing again, unable to take a failure as a sign of progress and going further down the weed addiction spiral. Know that your failures are the biggest signs of that progress, you just need to have a better plan next time. And if that fails, then work out an even better plan, until it works.

Another thing that really helped me is this subreddit. Not only is it super helpful to read like-minded people, but interacting and encouraging others made me realize how much I actually want to quit myself. The things I've been advising to other people were advises for myself too, and that was super super helpful - talking about things is about the best thing you can do for your mental health.

I also had the struggle of hanging out with friends who are stoners and we'd use to smoke together for years. I was worried our friendship would grow weak without getting to smoke together, but I realised it didn't have to be that way. Talking to them about my issues and asking them to be accepting really got us closer - they felt like they were helping me out and I would appreciate that, so really our friendship only got stronger. When we were hanging out, I had some whiskey and tobacco, which of course isn't great for you either, but hey, one thing at a time, Rome wasn't built in a day and all that.

Going forward, I am not planning to ever go back to the anxiety-filled life I lead for the past 5 years. It's time for some new and exciting thing - I'll let my love for discovering new things and hobbies drug me instead - something tells me that'll be more fruitful. :)

I am really sorry for the long post but if you read this - I really appreciate it, I wrote it for me and you. If you have any questions or looking for any advice, I'd be more than happy to reply.  I really wish you all the best of luck on finding your path towards the life you seek - a path not shrouded in green smoke.",3

**tl;dr:** Haven’t struggled too much with the quitting. I know I’ll want to smoke when I visit a friend this weekend. How bad of an idea is it?

So I’ve been smoking for about 5 years, basically every day for 4. Long story short, finally decided it was time to quit and I’m now on day 9. The big reasons I wanted to quit are for motivation/memory improvements. I just finished college a few months ago and figured I should stop smoking while I figure out my next step, since weed makes me content with not really moving my life forward.

Unlike a lot of what I’ve read on this sub, I didn’t really have crazy withdrawal symptoms. It was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be. Urges for a couple days (more out of habit) and then I’ve been pretty fine with not smoking. I’ve just got kind of an addictive personality and smoked out of boredom, but wasn’t really escaping from anything.

But here’s where I’m curious to hear some of your experiences: were you able to smoke for a day and hop back off the stoner train? I’m gonna be staying at a friend’s this weekend, and her mom grows pretty dank weed. She (the mom, my friend won’t be there) just harvested her plants and is excited for me to try some of it. I honestly really want to smoke with them and try some of this year’s homegrown, but I’m not sure if it’s a bad idea?

So what are your thoughts/experiences? Is it too easy to slip back into old habits? Is taking a day off not too big of a deal, especially since I haven’t had significant withdrawal symptoms, and since I’ll be in a different setting than my everyday? My friend’s mom is a therapist so maybe this would be a good chat to have with her? If I say I’m not smoking right now I know she’ll be supportive, or probably have good advice for healthy ways to handle urges.

I think I know the answer I’m gonna get from you all, but I just really want to hear that it’s okay to skip a day of weed sobriety. And honestly I might do it anyway... so any tips to help keep it a then and there kinda thing if I do slip up?",4

📷

**Quitting bad habits is EASY, you've just been using the wrong method!**

Normally people quit a habit using willpower, but willpower is a limited resource.

When we rely on willpower we encounter ego-depletion - We lose all motivation to keep fighting and give in to our raging craving.

For example:

When you first quit, you can do well for a few days...

Then you start to think *""Maybe just this one time""* or *""I've been good, I can just do it a little""*.

And you give in.

But don't worry, **THERE IS ANOTHER WAY:**

Using this strange method, I have quit alcohol, sugar, binge eating, smoking, porn and procrastination.

As a result I have lost 70 pounds, found a girlfriend, quit all medication and I wake up with a smile on my face.

Here is the method:

1. Meet your Addiction Voice (AV)

You bad habit or addiction has it's own voice, the AV.

The AV wants you to give in to your cravings, and works by hijacking your inner monologue.

It will say things in your own voice like *""Why don't you just smoke one more time, it won't do any harm!""* or *""You need to smoke, or you will get grumpy and damage your relationships.""*

The truth is:

**Everything the AV says is a lie to get you to give in to your bad habit.**

2) Learn to recognise your AV

Your AV can be brought to light by making The Law.

The Law is unbreakable, and doesn't require any willpower to follow.

Does it require willpower for you not to steal a car or rob a bank?

NO!

The Law cannot be broken at any point.

Write down your law if it helps, but the most important part is defining it.

E.g. ""I will never smoke again"".

But how can this help you recognise your AV?

**Because any thought that pops in your head that contradicts the law is the AV, not you.**

3) Create an AV Avatar

Assign an avatar to your AV.

For example, my smoking AV was an old, ugly man who chain smoked and had cancer.

Whenever I'd hear him say *""Go on, just have a quick one, it can't hurt!""* I'd say ""Screw you old man"" and give him the finger.

This also helps with cravings.

**Cravings aren't really happening to you, they are happening to your AV avatar.**

Your AV Avatar wants to give in, not you!

Without you giving in, they will disappear and die!

Your true self is already free of this addiction, so the cravings aren't happening to you, they are happening to your AV.

Extra tips:

* NEVER NEGOTIATE. If you keep playing with your AV and trying to argue, you will just end up giving in. AS SOON AS YOUR RECOGNISE YOUR AV, SHUT IT DOWN.
* Make your avatar ugly, not friendly. They are the scum of the earth. My binge avatar was a pig - not a cute little one, a fat smelly, warty one.
* Always remember, your AV cannot make you do anything. All it can do is speak to you, you don't have to do what it says!
* Your cravings and voice will disappear faster than you realise, but NEVER let your guard down.

Now go out there and kick your AV's ass and say goodbye to your bad habit!",1670

I have to write, I have to draw, and I have to think of concepts to work on. It’s still hard for me to see these things as something that I want to do, because i used to hate putting in effort and using all of my brain power.

I don’t like who I’ve become and I want to make serious changes...setting a date of November 1st to quit cold turkey while reading through this thread for strength and inspiration.  

My question is.. what about partners? 

I have a partner who smokes daily as well—in fact, my usage started when I started dating him. 

He does not buy into any of the harmful side effects and he doesn’t think pot has affected him negatively in any way.   (Which I disagree with strongly lol)

I don’t want to force someone to quit when they aren’t ready... but at the same time, I can’t have it in our home anymore.

Started as a casual smoker when I was 15, then around 22 that became all day every day. Buying weed often took priority over things like paying rent on time, keeping my car in good repair, or dressing like an adult. I'm 30 now, and this is by far the longest I've gone without. 

I'm originally from California, and weed is a big part of my community there--all my good friends smoke, my parents grow, my brother works in the business, etc. Fortunately I'm in NYC now so while it's still super ubiquitous I'm not quite as immersed in the culture. 

I also gave up alcohol 110+ days ago, and have been going to AA meetings. Most of the people in my meetings also have given up weed after realizing they couldn't moderate, so it's nice to be in good company and have that accountability. I'd say the desire to smoke is greater than the desire to drink. I miss the ritual and the feeling of smoke in my lungs. 

I've saved a ton of money, but I feel like I feel the same. I haven't gotten that wave of clarity others mention, nor do I have PAWS. My tolerance was so high that getting high was a pretty rare occurrence. So I just tell myself, why harm your health and your finances to end up in the same place?

Aside from that, nothing major really changed, I still have the same behavior.

This is where I know that being sober is a mean to be productive and not the end itself.  I know that the best way not to relapse is to keep busy but I can't seem to do anything that keeps my mind off it. I'm afraid this is what will lead me to relapsing again but also that I'm losing the momentum I gained by quitting in the first place.

Today... I am filled with uncontrollable anger. All I can think about is smoking or drinking so that it goes away. I have nothing to redirect this anger other than my fucking useless internship which is being cancelled all the time by my teacher. I have no routine and I can't stand this fucking college town. I'm 27 and way too old for this constant playground. I could study, read or exercise, but the only thing going through my mind are violent thoughts, I feel like screaming at random people on the streets or, alteratively, drink and smoke myself to oblivion. It's way too early and I have jack shit to do. There's nothing I can do, I'm stuck. Maybe tomorrow will be better but right now every minute feels like eternity.",26

My SO never really smoked except on weekends when he’d had a few beers. I’d come home from work, get high, and then we’d lie around in the couch watching tv and cuddling. I’d do the dishes while I cooked my endless dinners and snacks. It was great in a way. 

Now that I’m sober I am so bored and frustrated all the time. I come home to a messy house and a husband flopped in the couch watching tv. I cannot watch a single repeat of kitchen nightmares again or I’m going to scream. I want to go for hikes or runs or take the dogs for a walk and he just wants to watch tv. I try to cook healthy meals and he just eats takeout. Our sex life was amazing after I quit but now I’m so frustrated I can’t even pretend to be sexually attracted to him lately. I get frustrated with lack of caring and notice how mean he is now that I’m not in the clouds. I mention all this to him and he says he’s tired from work. Part of me wishes I could go back to being a stoner so we could have a great relationship again but I don’t like being foggy and tired all the time. 

Anyone else have this problem when they quit? How did you fix it?

I'm pretty sure my appetite as returned to 100% normal though. Or close to.

No dreams last night that i can remember. I'm still having night sweats and changing t-shirts in the middle of the night and swapping wet pillows. 

My moods aren't great either yet. Still up and down. I'm looking forward to starting an exercise regime soon.

The process of accepting, grieving, and forgiveness is really difficult. 

I am accepting the reality I was dealt. Grieving for what I didn’t have in life. Crying for all those times I never did, never allowed myself to. Forgiving myself for the mistakes I made. Sad that there were times that I didn’t allow myself to feel sorry for me, I just kept going, survival. 

I am grateful to have the ability to feel these emotions, to finally see the difficulty I have survived.  This six weeks has been a journey, and there are still so many roads to travel. I am grateful to have a connection here, to know I’m not the only one. 

For those who have just begun, hang in there. For me, the first 2 weeks were torture. Then the cravings subsided. I still struggle with boredom at times. I am scared for how this journey of mine will continue, but also realize the processing of trauma could not have happened while numb.

2019-10-22 02:25:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dldui3/day_one_almost_over/,Day one almost over,"I've probably tried to quit at least 100 times, and they all end the same way... cravings would hit (and i have many many many triggers, boredom being the top), i would cave almost immediately, smoke a bowl, feel good for a while but feel like shit right after because the rest of my day is a write off, and smoking more to make myself feel better. 

It's a really deep, slippery hole to fall in. For me personally, this  cycle of smoking-regret-smoke-some-more is exhausting. It's draining. it's disheartening. I don't even care about the money. I care about my brain, my happiness level, the people around me who don't smoke, and what i am missing out in life. I want to feel feelings again. I want to remember experiences. i want to feel connected. i want to participate again, tired of being a spectator.

I started smoking in Uni when i was 21. i never thought i would get addicted to it. I always thought, i am the master and weed is my bitch. well... took me a while to finally admit, even to myself, that i have a problem. it became very apparent when i snapped at my girlfriend when she called me out on my addiction. Still i didn't stop. i was in denial. i was convinced that the only way to live, is to YOLO, and that justifies the smoking. i didn't have a reason not to smoke.

and it's always the same story. at the end of the baggie, i would promise myself, i'll stop. but no... there's always a reason to buy a new bag. i promise i would be disciplined. no more waking and baking. i'll only smoke with friends. i'll only smoke after 9pm. but i guess, those were all empty words. i always buy in bulk because it's cheaper. guess what? my intake rate is proportional to how much weed i have. i promised i would make this ounce last a year. nope... lasted less than a month. And repeat.

today, i struggled not to buy a new baggie. it was tough, as i was driving home from work, Monday was rough, and i have to work a bit more at home. usually i would get stoned to work from home. It's my way of compensating myself for working overtime. luckily there was a traffic jam on the way to the store which made me change my mind.

which lead me to this post.  what i learned, and i am hoping you find value in my lesson... is that, cravings come in waves. they usually go away as quickly as they come. the trick is to ride it out. I made it, but not without difficulty though. i had to be really present to how i feel when i am stoned, which is having a muddled mind, slow reaction, inability to connect with people and surroundings, and many many more shitty feelings. Also, reading posts in this sub totally helped, which is one of the reasons why i want to contribute. 

I made it. fucking rights. i don't feel like shit, and tomorrow should be a good day.

take care, you guys. i'm with you. all the way.",8

The technique originated with Jerry Seinfeld. He used it as a way to force him to write jokes every day when he was an up-and-coming comedian. 

The technique was shared with a younger comedian who asked Seinfeld for advice on how to be a better comedian. His response was as follows:

>He revealed a unique calendar system he uses to pressure himself to write. Here's how it works.

>He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker.

>He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. ""After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.""

>**""Don't break the chain,"" he said again for emphasis.**

I am someone who has terrible trouble staying motivated on many different things and can confirm that this DOES work for me. Once you see the chain and you internalize that your mission is **Don't Break The Chain!** you will do everything in your power to succeed. The longer the chain gets, the more attached to it you will become.

Seriously, give it a shot! 

Most of the info from this post came from this article here: https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626

But if you do a google search, you can find a bunch of resources available to incorporate this strategy into your life. Calendars, phone apps, etc. 

Remember: **Don't Break the Chain!**",28

Longtime lurker of this subreddit. LONGTIME, like three years. I thought I’d do something cool for everyone and provide you with day-to-day updates on how I’m feeling as I go through the process of quitting weed. I made this account specially for this. Here's an important timeline to illustrate how my addiction came to be:

**Winter 2015:** Got high for the first time at 15 years old with a pipe.

**Spring 2015:** Experimenting with weed still; I turn 16 years old.

**Summer 2015:** Getting high with friends every weekend with a pipe or bong. Started smoking blunts (weed wrapped in a tobacco cigarello). I started with Swisher Sweets.

**Fall 2015:** Getting high every other day with a pipe, bong or cartridge.

**Christmas 2015:** Got my first weed pen. This was the worst mistake of my life.

**Winter 2016:** Because of the pen, I start to get high every day.

**Spring 2016:** Officially a daily smoker; I turn 17 years old. I’m smoking blunts and the pen every day.

**Summer 2016:** The “best” summer of my life; smoking and drinking with friends into oblivion every. single. fucking. day. It was a LIT summer and my body was able to handle it. The sad part is I can barely remember this summer at all.

**Fall 2016:** With my normal weight being \~165lbs., I now weigh 205 pounds in the Fall of 2016. I’ve stopped running and I’m eating like crazy because I’m smoking every day. At this point, I am smoking swisher sweets, the vape pen and a bong. This is when I first started to feel the effects of depression. This is when I first found r/leaves.

**Winter 2017:** My depression begins to become “invisible” because all of the smoking I’m doing.  The depression is existent but not disabling and is hard to recognize since I’m getting high all of the time. I start to run to lose weight and fight depression. I’m still smoking a blunt or hitting the pen every day at this point.

**Spring 2017:** I begin to lose weight and I become less depressed, but the depression is still there. I start to blame my physical appearance for my depression. I start to smoke way more than usual and thus begin to “turtle” away from everyone because I’m content being high and existing by myself. I start smoking Dutches and Backwoods (two different tobacco wraps). I’m smoking around 2-3grams per day. I turn 18 years old.

**Fall 2017:** One of the first peaks of my marijuana addiction. I’m smoking blunts every day. I’m hitting the weed pen every hour or two. I start to ditch school to get high. I start coming to class high. Honest to God, I have little to no recollection of this time period. The only memories I have from this time period is when I look at Snapchat memories and give my friends the “oh yeah” response about the whole experience. But the truth is, I can only remember the moment I see on the Snapchat memory. (Snapchat memories are like iCloud photo storage, except they show you your saved photos/videos on the exact date you’re currently in).

**Winter 2018:** I just remember finishing college applications and being stressed out all of the time. At this point, I’m down to 180lbs. (woohoo!). I started having more and more thoughts about quitting weed during this time. But with college acceptance/denial letters around the corner, you can bet your bottom dollar that I upped the smoking I was already doing. I’m smoking a backwood every day at this point.

**Spring 2018:** I got into a good school! Everything felt vivid. I decided that, to celebrate my university admission, I would try my best to quit smoking weed. I waited until May 1st to quit. When May 1st came around, I went cold turkey **and quit for 24 days!** This has been my greatest accomplishment so far in fighting my marijuana addiction. But, here we are, over a year and a half later. I turn 19 years old.

**Summer 2018:** Best summer of my life. I resume smoking weed because I was “able to quit” for 24 days. Boy, did I slip back into it REAL good.

**Fall 2018-Spring 2019:** I’m smoking a dutch or a backwood every day. School was incredibly stressful. **This is the only time period during my addiction that I will stand my ground and say that I** ***actually*** **had too much pressure to quit smoking marijuana**. I tried quitting in the spring, but I cracked  hard because of midterms, final exams and peer pressure. At this point, I'm now 20 years old.

**Summer 2019:** The absolute height of my addiction. I came back home for the summer ready to quit. But, as I’ll reflect on in my future posts, boredom is a HUGE killer when it comes to abstaining from pot. Thus, I irresponsibly let myself loose and began smoking more than I have ever smoked in my life. I was half-ass trying to quit during this time. I did cut down my tobacco intake, though. I started taking edibles instead of smoking at night because of some newfound breathing problems (I would like to elaborate, but I have homework I need to go work on right now).

**Fall 2019:** Here I am, back at school. My anxiety is getting the worse of me and I can see it affecting my social life and my happiness. I bought a bong when school started to quit smoking tobacco wraps. I did quit the tobacco successfully. However, I know I really need to cut marijuana out of my life.

There’s a lot I want to reflect on and share with you guys. I will do so in my future daily entries. However, I’ll leave you with one last thought: why quit now?

I have a lot of motivators to make me quit. But the main reason why I’m quitting? There’s this girl I really like and I want her to be mine. But she absolutely DETESTS smokers. She told me this one story about how she was going on a run one day (near the beach, I think?) and she said she ran past someone smoking a joint on the sidewalk. She said when she ran past the dude and smelled all of the pot, she wanted to fucking strangle him until he suffocated. When I heard her say that, I could immediately see myself in that guy’s shoes (because I smoke in public sometimes). After that afternoon I spent with her, I went back into my dorm and decided that I didn’t want to be a bum anymore and that I could be worthy to have this girl be mine one day.

So… here goes nothing. It’s night time right now. The last time I smoked was last night. I was ripping a bong and had a “celebratory” backwood with my roommate and one of my old high school friends for my last night of smoking. I can feel the withdrawals already kicking in right now because I haven’t smoked today. Headaches. Anxiety. So… I’m gonna go on a run right now and finish my homework. I will tell you more about how I’m feeling tomorrow! For now, I’ve officially started Day 1.",3

Also realizing the degree to which I am, and have been, a stimulant addict. Namely, coffee & energy beverages. I used the two together. Caffeine would spin my brain up; weed would take the edge off, so I could abuse caffeine even more. Like, I’d knock back 4 energy beverages before making morning coffee. I was slowly killing myself while thinking I felt great. 

I quit energy beverages at the same time as weed. That was its own hell. Now I think I need to quit coffee, and all caffeine, altogether. The anxiety... the daily cycle to my own behavior... I can see it. It’s already created a rift in one personal relationship. Without weed to take the edge off, it’s become my new “partner,” and I can finally see what a hard drug it is. Socially accepted, even encouraged, but a hard drug nonetheless.

It caused me to actually *look* at how much I was smoking, and how I was using it to not deal with any of my emotions. It wasn't easy, but I stopped. It's been about four and a half months since I got clean from pot, and I haven't engaged in drinking or anything else since then either. I never had any issues with alcohol, was never much of a fan of it, would drink 1-2 times a month tops and never had more than two or three drinks. I've been happy, for the most part since I quit, and am definitely a better person than I was when I was using.

But fuck, man, do I miss being able to get out of my head. My depression has been really bad lately and I just want to be able to dissociate for a minute. When I first got sober I thought the hardest part would be the social stuff, but I never really cared for parties or bars or anything like that in the first place, and honestly the sort of social interactions I had that were based around drinking or smoking were never fulfilling in the first place. That's not the case for me now. I'm just so miserable in my head and I want to get out of it so badly and stop thinking for a minute, but I'm terrified. I can't smoke again, nor do I want to, and I know I never had any problems with alcohol and doubt it'd be a problem, but I'm afraid of all the issues that it would bring up in my relationship with my mom if she ever found out I was drinking at all, or how it would impact the relationships with the sober friends I've made. 

I just feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because I want to get out of my head but I don't know if there's any safe way for me to do it. Do I run the risk with drinking and then go back to being fully sober if I ever need to or do I just stay like this and stay miserable? It's just really tough. 

I don't know what the purpose of this post was, but I just needed to vent. If anyone else is in the same place I am, please PM me. I'd love a friend I could talk to.",8

Quitting weed is hard enough.,"So I've made the decision to live a sober life. I've struggled with depression and CPTSD, and I know I have to do it for my health, both mental and physical. I've quit before, so I'm confident that (with this sub's help and other support) I can handle getting clean.

My main problem is my best friend/former roommate. She's a huge stoner, to the point where it's a part of her identity and pretty much all we do when we hang out. She's also bipolar and has a lot of bad habits and outlooks that just won't jive with a healthy lifestyle for me. For example, she still does other drugs like Molly and acid, which is her prerogative I guess, but she brings them up to me all the time despite me saying I'm no longer doing them and think they're not good for her.  

Ok so I guess she's toxic and I should just drop her out of my life to achieve my goals and be a better person? It's not that easy! I'm struggling because for one, she's essentially my only friend that I see regularly. (Like I know other people but it's mostly social media type friendships.) We also became roommates during a super dark time, and she literally saved my life. I had just been through a traumatic breakup and would've been homeless had she not given me a place to stay. I moved into my own place about six months ago, but we're like family, despite everything. 

I can see the ways she's toxic, but I can't just drop my best friend. How do I deal with this? I'm not going to get all preachy with her. I won't create a fight to end the friendship. I can't just ghost her. Can I do a slow fade? Do I just tell her ""hey I'm sober now,"" and let the chips fall where they may? Help!

TL;DR - My best friend isn't sober at all. How do I kindly end the friendship so I can get clean?",1

Honestly I’d really like to smoke but to be even more honest I feel way better about myself being able to finally say no and stick to it. It’s really refreshing to feel like I’m in control of myself. I know it’s a long journey ahead but I really feel like I’m finally ready to put that chapter of life behind me.

Sure people smoke cigarettes everyday but they are often looked down upon. People who drunk everyday are labeled alcoholics. People who use any other drug everyday are definitely labeled addicts, because they are hard drugs.

But weed? It's totally fine. I agree that weed is harmless for a lot of people and it's BS that's it's been illegal for so long. But I think many people have reacted to that by preaching about how weed can't harm ANYONE. Weed CAN harm people and does regularly.

Everytime I have a good sober streak going, the thing that makes me cave is this exact thought, ""I have plenty of friends who smoke weed a lot. It's normal. Weeds not that big of a deal. It seems like I'm overreacting by quitting forever.""

But as soon as I relapse, I realize I wasn't overreacting. I feel anxious, regretful, in a haze. I have no motivation. My entire body itches to get home so I can smoke. The highs aren't even good. They feel desperate, empty, and tiring.

Here's My Story.,"wow - It's already been 6 months since I started my first day without weed in years. I've been lurking in this sub for a while, and I'm a busy college student with a crazy week ahead of me, but I really want to share my story with you guys to hopefully help others who went through or are currently going through a rough time right now.

Like most of you here, I started smoking when I was in High School. My best friend and I started smoking in sophomore year of High School, just on occasion when we were skiing or hanging out with other friends that smoked too. I never bought my own supply, but slowly after smoking more I bought some supplies and a glass piece off the internet and started to smoke just on the weekends in my basement when I was done with work. I tried to keep this habit secretive, and too this day I kept my OPSEC and my parents never caught me red-handed. This weekend use slowly turned into daily use by Junior year, where I would smoke right as I got back from school, until the time I went to bed. I always made sure I wasn't high when I was at school or at work, but that slipped as I got out of a gap-year and into my first year of University. My roommate was a huge smoker, dealed flower, dabs, carts, etc out of the room, and I got almost all of my supply for free for helping him sell to people that stopped by throughout the day. We hit my PAX from the time we woke up, after class, and throughout the day. I was smoking close to 2 grams of wax a week during my first semester. My procrastination got worse and worse, and I started to slip up academically. I ended my first semester with just above a 3.0 GPA (I could've done so much better if I didn't smoke, those classes were easy af in hindsight), but my lazy self thought it was good enough - until January of this year.

I worked at a movie theatre during winter break, and one day I was cleaning theatres with the soapy water mix and a microfiber towel. I must have forgotten to wash my hands or I touched my mouth before washing my hands, and the next morning I woke up with terrible stomach pains and vomited as I have never vomited before. That day was rough, and I have memories burned into my brain about how terrible that experience was. I'm pretty sure I caught the norovirus, but what came out of it was much worse. Over the next week, my appetite fell - I was maybe eating 300-500 calories a day, I was having constant stomach pains and terrible bowel movements where I was literally pooping black. These symptoms got worse when I hit my pax or took a rip of a dab pen. On the day I had to drive back up to school, I got so lightheaded and dizzy I had to pull over multiple times on the highway to take a breather or else I thought I was going to pass out. My symptoms got even odder, any food that wasn't ""simple"" would wreak havoc on my GI tract, and I was going in-between constipation and bloat to full-on diarrhea day after day. I would get motion sick when the room was too dark when I was trying to go to bed, so I had to have some sort of light in order to not get dizzy. This went on for months - I felt so sick on my 20th birthday after eating Ice-Cream I was seriously thinking about suicide. When you deal with this crap day after day, being dead honestly felt like a better solution than dealing with terrible stomach aches all day, feeling like you might puke at any moment, and worrying about where the bathroom is at any given moment.

On April 20th, I was hanging out with all my college friends smoking some blunts, when I just got so anxious and felt so crappy I had to call it and spent the rest of the day on the toilet silently crying. I was so fing done with how I was feeling - I was desperate for anything to make me feel better. I did a lot of research on CHS (cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome), and I was convinced that I might have gotten it after using a lot when I initially got sick. So April 21st, 2019, I stopped smoking weed. My symptoms were still there, and psychological withdrawals were a bitch, but after that first tough week, I started to feel a little more there. However, I still was dealing with the same crap with my GI tract. I ended up going to the doctors multiple times, did blood tests and stool tests, with the only odd thing being a small bacterial infection in my small intestine. After going through the doctors, they thought I had gotten PV-IBS (Post Viral Irritable Bowel Syndrome), and I got prescribed a boatload of antibiotics and other anti-spasm drugs. By this point, I lost around 20lbs of weight, felt super crappy on the drugs because I couldn't even use nicotine, and got depressed. I eneded up going to a Gastroentroligst, where they were a great help in identifying different diets I could try, and let me tell you, I tried almost everything - Low FODMAP, Gluten-Free, Keto, etc. Nothing worked. I ended up getting ordered to do a colonoscopy and endoscopy, but my insurance is messed up and I would have had to pay over $3,000 out of pocket to get the procedure done, so I canceled. twice. I wasn't going to risk paying all that money to get an ""everything looks good, we don't know what's going on"" when I get out of the hospital. I ended up finding that Lactose made me feel extra crappy, so I cut out all dairy products, and ended up feeling a lot better - instead of dealing with pain every single day, I only had to deal with it a couple of times a week. I think the viral and bacterial infections along with the crazy antibiotics I was taking stopped the production of the lactose enzime to an extent. Milk and Icecream still messes me up, but all other dairy products are alright with me today. This went on all summer - some days I would feel totally normal, and other days I could barely get out of bed because I was in so much pain.

Today as I'm writing this, I'm thankfully back to normal. I haven't had a flare-up in over a month, I'm off all my medication, and most importantly I kicked my habit of smoking weed every single waking minute of my life. To those with suspected PV-IBS or CHS, It is absolutely worth it to quit for 6 months and see what happens. You're not going to feel better in a week, you probably won't feel better in a month, and if you have PV-IBS, you're probably not going to feel much better in four months. Stick with it, because I can tell you, it's a long, rough road but you're going to get out of this feeling better, even if you feel like you won't. I believe in you, even though you might not believe in yourself. I literally thought about killing myself because I felt so terrible and there were almost no resources about this. For those with PV-IBS, Famotidine is a great OTC drug to help with stomach problems, It literally saved my butt more times than I can count - you don't need to go to a GI specialist to get it either, but the prescription version is stronger and helps within a couple of minutes. PM me if you need anything, this is my alt because I don't want my family to see this but I will try my best to help you out with anything.

To all of you just starting your journey for health-related issues or not - The first month sucks. I get it. Whenever I felt bored and sober, I had this urge to pack a pax bowl and get high. But every time I thought about that, I remembered how terrible, anxious, foggy, shaky, and pain that would cause. Remember what smoking does to you. Do you really want to feel like crap again? The best way to prevent this is to put all your smoking stuff in a bag/box, put it in a corner of your room or someplace safe, and forget about it. I dumped all the rest of my bud down the toilet and gave my carts to my friends. If all of your friends smoke, hopefully, they will be supportive enough to respect your decision and help you out - not smoke around you, prevent you from changing your mind if you want to be fully committed, and hopefully still do what you guys/girls like to do together, but without involving weed directly. Once again, if you need anything, PM me, or comment down below. I can do my best to be supportive of anything going on in your life to the best of my ability.

What I've noticed and done without smoking weed is amazing - I have a 3.8GPA this year so far, my focus has never been so good, I'm not as awkward in social events anymore, I'm not as impulsive or selfish, and the money I've saved from spending on bud and wax has gone to the hobbies I truly enjoy - my car, skiing, audio and computer equipment, etc. I don't know how I was able to keep so cool around my family when I was baked at home, and instead of hiding in my room playing videogames or watching Youtube, I'm spending a lot more time downstairs with my dad and mom watching movies or talking about what's going on. I also don't have to stress about drug tests anymore, so I was finally able to get a job this semester that I've wanted to do forever but just couldn't do before thanks to this new lifestyle.

I have no plans on smoking again in the near future - this has been the longest I've ever gone without weed since I started smoking. I feel great. Opportunity to smoke happens all the time in my environment I'm in right now - my new roommate also smokes, my hallway always smells like weed - hell, there's a dude down the hallway I could pick up an oz from for cheap. But I'm not going to do it. It takes a lot of willpower to not do it, but I'm in it for the endgame, and my success and wellbeing is worth way more than spending money to feel like crap. If you're still reading this, I honestly thank you for taking the time to read about my story. I will for sure keep you all updated when I hit the 9 months and year mark, and how much I've been able to get done vs what I probably would've passed off If I was still smoking. I'm proud of all of you guys/girls, from your first day-ers to you seasoned veterans with 3+ years off of weed. Keep at it, the longer you go without it, the better you will feel.",19

The weed gives me major anxiety when I’m stoned, and I’m tired of constantly feeling afraid that something bad is going to happen. It gives me depression when I quit, so I’m going to have to work through that this week. I have a big week ahead in University (I’m a mature student) and I’m not going to let my addiction win this time. It’s my body and my brain, and I control it.

Numbing the pain does nothing but make that pain metastasize. Before I ever touched drugs and alcohol, I already used food and video games addictively after Middle School to numb myself to the feelings I didn't want to face. I also used them to hide from the fear of failure throughout high school. Despite being an excellent student, my emotional maturity stopped dead in adolescence because of this compulsive behavior. The only way I will ever succeed and stay sober is to stop being afraid to fail and fail again. That fear has led to untold misery and isolationism for me that stunted my social skills for years.

2019-10-21 10:45:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dl1kpw/day_21_things_i_have_noticed/,Day 21 - Things I have noticed,"Hey everyone,

I am someone who smoked on and off for the past 5 years, my longest period being 14 months sober after 2 years of daily use before relapsing. My 2nd attempt was earlier this year and I only lasted 29 days. Well this is my 3rd time quitting and I am currently on Day 21. This time is different, the withdrawals have been way more intense this time around and no way in hell am I going to go back to Weed again after this. I just wanted to share with you all where I currently am in my recovery, what I have had to deal with and things I have noticed this time around. I'll go through it all in chronological order.

Firstly, the First Week felt like a mild Opiate withdrawal process. I used to be addicted to Tramadol after a Doc gave me hundreds of pills after a car crash when I was 21 so I know what that kind of withdrawal is like. Here is a list of all that I experienced during the first week:

* Vomiting several times per day.
* Severe Nausea.
* No Appetite.
* Profuse Sweating 24/7.
* Violent Diarrhea.
* Wild Mood Swings.
* Insomnia that resulted in averaging only 1 or 2 hours of sleep per night. Some nights I got no sleep at all.
* Inability to work full time.
* Mild Visual and Auditory Hallucinations from lack of Sleep.
* Feeling like I had the Flu.
* Began losing weight rapidly - approximately 1.5lbs per day.

Nothing I did helped with any of the symptoms other than Anti-Emetic medication from my Dr for the vomiting and Nausea. I just had to ride every other symptom out. I was unable to keep most food down longer than a few minutes. I estimate I was surviving on perhaps 300 or 400 calories per day.

The Second Week things started to slowly improve each day.

* The Vomiting stopped altogether.
* Nausea went away too but that could be because I was now on the Anti-Emetics.
* Appetite was still very poor but improved slightly. My Calorie intake increased to almost 1000 per day.
* Day time sweating dropped massively but night sweats were still incredibly bad.
* Diarrhea started to come and go. I noticed on days when I was able to consume a lot of Fiber that it was much less frequent.
* Mood swings got less intense but I started to develop ""Pink Cloud Syndrome"". This became so intense at around Day 10 - 14 that I would actually start ""Gurning"" like I was coming up on a light to moderate dose of MDMA around mid-day each day. I would also have the weird stomach feeling of coming up on MDMA too. This got so intense at one point that whilst Food Shopping I had to clamp my jaw together and strain the muscles in my jaw and cheeks to stop my jaw from moving back and forth of it's own will.
* Insomnia was still a bitch but I started averaging 2 - 4 hours sleep each night instead of just 1 - 2 hours. This was still a pain but a step in the right direction.
* I was still in no state to work full time sadly.
* Hallucinations stopped altogether since I started getting a bit more sleep.
* Flu like feelings and symptoms tapered off into feeling like just a regular manageable Cold.
* Still losing weight but not as much since being able to stomach more food. I was losing less than 1lb per day.

At the 14 Day mark, despite noticing improvements, I was still feeling so overwhelmed by the Withdrawal process that I was getting cravings at certain points when my mood dipped. If I hadn't thrown out my stash and all Paraphernalia I may have relapsed.

Today marks Day 21 for me and thus I am in the final hours of Week 3. Here is where I really noticed things improving and I slowly started to feel like my old ""Pre-Weed"" Self.

* Appetite slowly returned to normal over the next 7 days. By Day 19 of my overall journey through Withdrawal I was finally able to get my calorie intake up to around the 1800 - 2000 mark which is a healthy range for me given that I am not all that physically active at the moment.
* Day time sweating returned to normal on Day 19 too, Night Sweats are still an issue though they are not anywhere near as bad as the first 2 weeks. I reckon that in a couple of days I will no longer have to sleep with a T Shirt on or have to towel myself off every time I wake up.
* My bowel movements are normal now. When I was a Stoner I had problems with bowel movements, not just during Withdrawal (Withdrawal made them 10 times worse though). It had gotten to the point where I went to the Dr a few months ago where I was diagnosed with IBS. Given I have predictable and healthy bowel movements every morning now I am convinced that it was Weed that was messing my Bowels up and I do not have IBS. I will of course be seeing my Dr about this though to confirm or disprove my assumption. My money is on me being correct though.
* No more Wild Mood Swings after Day 19 either, I now feel fairly well although re-learning how to deal with the ""Ups and Downs"" of life is going to take some time. I've noticed I am a lot more Empathetic towards people now, I pickup on things like body language and the tone of someone's voice now. When I was a Stoner I was blind to these kinds of things most of the time which resulted in people being less interested in talking to me. I am now noticing that my relationships with my family in particular are much better and I actually want to help them out with things like housework and running errands. In fact, I'd go as far as to say I actually get happiness and satisfaction from helping out now where as when I was a Stoner I never volunteered to help with anything, I had to be nagged and I resented people for asking for my help. I overall feel like a much better Human Being. Oh, and before I forget, the ""Pink Cloud Syndrome"" has gone altogether.
* Insomnia is still a problem but I am now up to averaging between 3 - 6 hours of sleep per night.
* I am currently debating when to return to work full time. I think just to be safe I will wait until I make it past Day 28 because I don't want to stress myself out whilst I still have some problems sleeping.
* The Cold symptoms have gone but have been replaced with coughing up a lot of Phlegm. From what I have read this is normal and a sign that my throat and lungs are healing after years of inhaling smoke. It's not painful or anything, just annoying at times when I can feel it trapped in my throat. Decongestant Meds from the Pharmacy are helping a lot with the discomfort.
* My Weight Loss has stopped. When I first quit I was exactly 150lbs and I bottomed out at 134lbs. All in all I lost 16lbs of body weight over approximately 19 Days. Today I stepped on the scales and I have gained 1lb in 2 days and plan to slowly put some weight back on. My target is 140lbs with a high protein, low carb, low fat and low sugar diet. I'm also going to start doing some light weight training to ensure the weight gains are all muscle. I don't want to end up with the ""Skinny Fat"" physique I had when I was a Stoner.

So there you go Ladies and Gentlemen, my Withdrawal experience thus far. I have 1 week left after tonight and then things should be back to normal. I can't wait to get back to averaging 6 - 8 hours of sleep per night and being able to work full time again and bring home the bacon as they say. Good luck to everyone else in their battle to beat Weed Addiction and thanks for reading my post. Things can only get better from here out, I've just got to avoid things and people that could trigger Cravings and also learn how to deal with stress and sadness without the aid of Weed. I'm confident that this is my final rodeo with that stinky plant, I really do not want to be dependent on it ever again. No way do I want to go through the Hell of quitting again either.

Good luck to you all! You can beat it if you try hard enough!",7

Still experiencing serious night sweats and broken sleep. Its much easier to get to sleep now and i feel much better in the mornings, so much easier to get out of bed.

My health and diet are improving,  I've been weight training 3 days a week and I'm planning to get a bike and go cycling maybe 3 times a week to, and genuinely looking forward to it.

Dreams are crazy vivid still, ive started a dream journal and been researching lucid dreamin for something to get into.

Cravings are still very real. Usually hit hardest while im in work coming to the end of a shift. Because smoking a fat J was always the first thing i did getting home after work. But I'm finding them easier to deal with already.

Instead of picking up the phone to text a dealer I'll plan what I'm going to do or eat when i get home.

It's not easy by any stretch of the imagination but I'm happy with my progress and feel I'm doing better this time than any other time I've attempted to quit before!",15

I smoked heavily on a daily (hell, hourly) basis for 15 years. Is it possible that it will take longer? I'm kinda worried, if this is what the ""new normal"" is. I'd really like to think that it's still going to get better.

We've all used the cliche before.  The good times are pleasant climbs to the top of a peak, the bad ones quick falls to the bottom.  But imagine you were on a wild roller coaster which is miles and miles long.  Towards the beginning, it's just another theme park ride.  It's fun, the ups and downs are exhilarating.  But imagine that the track deteriorates as the ride goes on.  One hill after the next, a little more rust shows through, overgrown bushes and branches hang a little closer.  With each subsequent hill, the track is missing a few more bolts, and is more rickety.  You want to get off, before the tracks run out, leaving you, the lone passenger of your life, to tumble to the earth.

It all started off so innocently, back in the day.  Just wanted to try it with some friends.  My first experience was actually horrible, I had a panic attack.  For some reason, I wanted to try it again, then again.  I didn't realize what I was seeking was relief and disconnection from my internal struggles.  I wanted to be released from stress or responsibility for my own life.  Unconsciously seeking a cure to discomfort which I didn't need, it wasn't long before I was an everyday smoker.

I would later get myself expelled during my first year at university for selling weed.  I justified it in a number of different ways.  Mainly I was trying to fuel my own habit and smoke for free.  It didn't matter, being kicked out of school made all excuses pointless and obsolete.  I moved to Scotland from the states, where I could potentially go back to University for free due to my citizenship.

That was three years ago, which is about how long it takes to establish residency.  I still haven't quit.  I feel like I've bottomed out a few times, and I'm heading for another one.  Thing is I'm not sure how much track I've got left before I permanently derail my life further.

I want to quit.  I've quit for a few months before.  I'm not looking for a t-break, I want to be done.  But every time I quit, something drags me back, I make some excuse up.  I was two months smoke free when I started dating a girl who was a heavy smoker.  It wasn't long before I was right back into it.  We broke up, but I stayed on it.  Since then, I've made several other attempts to quit, trashing my equipment, giving weed away, etc.  It rarely lasts more than a few days before I've got another baggy.

How do I get off this ride?  How do I commit to staying clean, and more importantly, how do I commit to the things I want out of life.  I have so many ambitions I'm leaving to the wayside, which is causing me depression.  I used to not even understand what depression is, or how it could possibly effect people.  I didn't get that it sets in slowly, steadily, as you watch a hopeless situation get worse.  I'm tired of being a bystander, and an observer of my own train-wreck of a life, and the first step to beating it is quitting weed.  How have you guys managed it?  How can I stay clean for more than a few days, or even a month, but instead for a year, or indefinitely for that matter?  Where do you guys find success?",3

As a result, when I first tried to quit, I found that the minute I had a relapse impulse... I could walk 5 minutes and have my fix again.

Threw all the pipes away? No problem. They sell packs of joints.

So finally, my stoned self took action, believe it or not.

The very last time I got high, I took the rest of my pot, and put it in the freezer. I took my last pipe, and put it in an envelope.

On that envelope, I wrote: ""I want to quit before I kill myself. -- me""

I put that envelope in a drawer in the bathroom.

I know that my stoned self wanted to quit even more than my sober self did. And frankly, I don't want to see that note. It keeps me from opening up that drawer, let alone that envelope.

I couldn't quit by throwing everything away. But by making it a choice, I could.

I hope this helps someone.",186
2019-10-21 02:35:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dkwf27/made_a_mess_of_my_life/,Made a mess of my life,"Well, as you may have guessed, I'm a marijuana addict. I quit smoking for good (I hope) about three weeks ago. Also quit drinking, and quit my addiction to energy beverages. I had been smoking marijuana like a chimney for 15 years, telling myself that it was helping, but it wasn't. I have very few personal relationships in my life, and the few that I have are tortured, to say the least.

I rage-quit my job without a plan two months ago. I've been scrambling to pick up the pieces ever since. I'm declaring bankruptcy. I've managed to get a part-time job and a part-time web development contract (the latter of which will end in less than 6 months), so I can pay rent for now.

EDIT: The job is night-shift, because the panic gets worse at night. I know this is causing other issues, but honestly, it was a necessary step.

I've reconnected with a girl whom I chased out of my life two years ago, when I went into pretty much total isolation. She lives with her boyfriend now. I'm in love with her, but it's just not possible. She's my closest friend. She's pretty much the only person I talk to on a daily basis. She knows how I feel about her, and has pulled back as a result. We're basically Twitter buddies now. You can imagine how it feels.

I'm 40. I feel panicked almost all of the time. I used to feel invincible. I can't even smoke weed anymore to get rid of this feeling, because... if I'm going to be honest... I quit once the weed itself began inducing, and amplifying, the panic.

A few years ago, I was popular. Had friends. A girlfriend. A high-paying job. I had an existential crisis, an emotional breakdown. I was in near-total isolation for close to two years. I chased so many people away. Now, I'd do anything for community.

I guess you guys are it.

I think the ""pink cloud"" has lifted, and now I'm facing what I've put off.

I'm starting a new business -- a ""green"" web site business, something I've wanted to do for a long time, with software I have been working on (in my weed-addled way) for over a decade. Along with a film review web site/Twitter. I know these are things I have going for me.

Every day is a struggle. It went from struggling to not smoking weed, to struggling with this feeling in my chest. I would never actually commit suicide, but every day the thought intrudes on me. I imagine many of you can relate. (I'd like to emphasize, I'm not the type. The thought of having *at least* that power seems comforting, in an f'ed-up way.)

This subreddit has been helping me. I made an account to post. You guys are my community now, I guess.

EDIT: Sometimes, I go to bars late at night, and drink club sodas & lime. The barkeeps remember me from my whiskey drinking days; I was always a ""friendly"" drunk, and they'd often serve me well past closing time. If you can handle being around alcohol without getting triggered to drink, I recommend this, if you get the same feeling. It can help. Bring a notebook with you. Write.

EDIT: I should add... after three weeks, I can sustain eye contact, and a conversation. I can feel my brain coming back. I'm actually quite an intelligent person, aside from f'ing up my life. And this is why I am also a terribly, terribly depressed person.",14

I e quit a lot and I mean a lot.  This time felt different, this time I knew I was going to get pass a couple of days with no smoking. If you really want to quit then you know deep down that you have stopped liking to get high. If you smoke 24/7, take a 2 hour break from smoking and see what you get done in that time. Maybe nothing, but you went 2 hours without smoking and you didn’t die. Trust me it gets tough. I have had extreme depression and panic attacks that last for hours, but I’ve also have been feeling a lot more emotion. The emotions are anger, sadness, and grief but now I feel like I’m alive. Before I never had emotions and now they may be bad emotions but it’s better than drifting through life as if I was a ghost. This quitting weed is not just about the weed. It’s about my life, although I haven’t cut out all my bad habits, I have started with baby steps and the first step was weed. Next is nicotine. Then exercise and eating healthy. I also have been going to therapy. It’s feels good. There are times I have felt so low, like the lowest I’ve ever felt. But I’ve also felt the highs (no pun intended). That’s what life is about. The highs and lows and how we respond.  I felt so low that I started smoking weed and now that I’ve quit, I’m realizing that life has a lot of low points and trying to get out of the lows with weed does not help.

There is an instant camaraderie and an ""us vs. the squares"" mentality among stoners.

I have previously been diagnosed with ""mild to moderate"" depression, whatever that means, but for the first time ever I am really convinced no life is > my current life.

I'm willing to fight if my brain can be fixed, but if there's no going back, I honestly don't see myself making it through this (not trying to sound extreme or like the ultimate victim; just want to know the facts without any bull shit or platitudes that I find IRL)

Thank you

edit:  not sure if this helps, but I haven't had a drink of alcohol in over a year and don't use any other substances",13

I want to like things again. I want to be interested in anything other than sleeping and eating. But it was never weed that was responsible for that. It was there before weed entered my life, and it remains since weed's left. It must be depression. My psychiatrist put me on a new medication this month after over a year on my old one. We'll see how that goes...

I've gone through a lot of changes this year besides quitting weed. I went vegan, I started my gender transition, I've cut toxic people out of my life, I got a job after spending over a year unemployed; all of these things extremely hard to do, and yet I got no satisfaction from any of it.

It wasn't until college started that I began smoking more regularly.  By the spring semester of freshman year I was smoking basically every day. Nearly a decade later from my first smoking experience.... Despite smoking almost every single day I've been able to make it through several years of health professional school.

But a recent breakup has had me reeling. It wasn't directly the fault of my addiction (as in not a cited reason for a breakup).... But it wasn't 'not' the fault of my addiction, if that makes sense. 

 I found myself in the cycle I had been caught in before, where I ramped up my smoking habits and take bong rips and play video games/watch TV/YouTube all day until I pass out on the couch. And I thought about my ex, where despite all of their own insecurities and problems, they didn't make substance use one of them. And I thought about how they worked out their stress and trauma through art and writing. Meanwhile... while yeah, I was still doing fine in school... But basically every minute not at school or at my duties I was stoned. Zoning out. Experiencing life passively with glazed red eyes. 

I don't want this to be my life any more. I want to create. To practice music again. To learn to draw. To write out my feelings. To make a YouTube channel. To travel. To meditate. To be a better version of myself. But I have an addiction. I can't have the life I want to have if weed is in it.

So I did it. I took my last bong rip, smashed it. threw out my lighters. My filters. My papers, my rollers. My two small pipes, my steamroller, hell--my trunk i kept it all in... And the rest of my weed. Basically everything that I don't think I could sell on eBay/Craigslist. 

This isn't the first time I've 'purged', but it's definitely the purgiest. This time feels different. This time will be different. I want to be better. I can be better. And I'm not alone in this struggle.

I will not smoke with you today.",3

It's the fallout of my addiction catching up to me. I also have withdrawals, stomach acid, and a decline in fitness progress to thank for it. The next school period is going to be far far better for me, and every period after that as well. And when I'm a practicing professional I owe it to myself and others to be sober.

Now my life will open up to friends, hobbies, and personal fulfillment. I'm no longer going to be dependent. I'll face life sober and try to enjoy it the best I can.",1

That means I need to drop but I need the deans permission since its so late. If he doest let me, Ill fail and my gpa will be crushed. Again. I JUST got it above 2.5! I skipped to smoke weed. This is all my fault. Im gonna owe at least 2 grand at the end to repay my financial aid and tuition. ILL finish school a semester late. My entire plan to graduate after fall 2021 is ruined. All over 1 class. I dont know what Im gonna do. I really dont. Im gonna go do my schoolwork for my other classes now but Ill be around. I just gotta finish crying first. On the bright side, I have 0 desire to ever partake in in drugs again.



TLDR Im out 2 months of pay for me. My bank is empty, my gpa is going to tank, and now my entire future is off. Dont let weed ruin you. It isnt worth it



Edit: Ive done my crying and worrying. Ive emailed my advisor asking to squeeze me in since they have no open slots. If they cant then on november 4th Ill go to walk in advising and tell her the situation minus the weed stuff and ask her what I need to do to drop. If I cant because the dean wont let me Ill take the F, repay my financial aid and tuition, and move forward. We'll redo my academic plan to accommodate. Maybe even consider taking this class by itself next semester since its a prereq for my other classes I was gonna take next semester and its a hard class. Things are gonna be ok for me if I keep my head on and stay sober. I genuinely hope you guys considering quitting look at me and learn from me. Please don't let any substance cause you to fail at anything. This time theres a chance things will be ok for me. Next time I might not be so lucky.",5

Weed had this magical aurora to it when I was young, and it helped me find a cool and accepting group of friends as the new kid, most of which I’m very close to to this day. Since I was 19 however, I have felt dependent on weed in order to eat, sleep, party, and even study. I’ve been able to do well enough in school, and really excited about the job I’m starting after graduation. But the thing is, weed has eroded my mental health, and forced me into only one way of dealing with stress and anxiety. It used to relax me, but over time as responsibilities grew, I would become paranoid unless I smoked myself into oblivion. What’s worse, smoking w tobacco has led me to development a nicotine addiction too, but that’s a whole other story. 

Point is, my 22nd birthday is in a few weeks, and I’m done. I told myself I’d stop smoking when I graduated high school, I told myself I would stop when I turned 20, then 21, and I’m sick of failing. I’ve been lurking on this sub for months, and I’ve been so encouraged by everyone’s progress and encouragement of one another. I really want to know what that clarity of mind everyone talks about feels like, I want to know what it feels like to be sober and happy about it.

I had no idea my REM sleep had dwindled to such low frequency during that time until I quit and the dreams flooded back. Now it seems that I dream vividly from the moment I go to sleep until I wake up. Wow. Who knew?

My primary reason for quitting is job related. I suddenly was directed to learn a ton of new material quickly (do or die in a high paying job), and found myself unable to do it. I knew my MJ use was surely the issue but I had always thought MJ interfered with learning in a more direct way. I.e., ""stoned too much so can't focus"". It did not occur to me, as I was unaware that I was not dreaming, that poor quality of sleep is another and possibly even more direct cause.

Now that I'm 3 weeks ""grounded"" I know absolutely that I don't want to go back to that miserable foggy mindset. I would lose myself in conversations, getting so easily derailed. ""What was I just saying, or about to say??? Uhh...."" That happened to me ALL the time, stoned or not. I would start reading a paragraph and by the end have no idea what was said when it began. My mind would wander all over the place.

Already I find it SOOO much easier to a) follow conversations, b) read and comprehend long articles, essays, and work-related material, and c) remember names, facts and the tangentially related thought to what you said 3 minutes ago. I have my brain back. 

Is there any research on this? I have read about stage 4 sleep being even more important than REM sleep for well being, and I would assume, learning. And also that these stages are sequential, meaning that you can't get to stage 4 sleep without first being in REM sleep.

Even as I pose this question I'm well aware of the limited science on MJ use in the US thanks to federal laws and such. Meanwhile so many of us have embarked on ""clinical trials"". We are documenting effects chronic use has had on us. Clearly there are impacts to our dreams, although I disagree that REM sleep is entirely absent during chronic use, or we would all be total zombies. Nevertheless the impacts seem to be undeniable. 

Before ending this post, I cannot resist drawing on the metaphor of habitual long term use and ""diminished dreams"". Weed was clearly limiting my literal dreaming as well as tamping down my goals in life both large and small. My dreams of becoming a better person, a better father, a better musician were all negatively impacted. Soooo many times while stoned I would think ""I should..."" and immediately reject that goal. No more!",4

The bad side is anxiety and restlessness. But when I do feel like this I’m just reminding myself it WILL pass and you know what... it does! The dreams are horrible and so vivid, even when I wake up as soon as I go back to sleep I step right back into the same dream, which sucks.

So here’s a little background for context: I started smoking with my best friend when I was 14 and it was some of the best times I ever had. However about 2 years ago he passed away and things have gotten out of hand. I went from smoking with friends on the weekend, to everyday after school, to multiple times a day after I graduated. It went from a social activity to a full blown coping mechanism.

I feel as if weed has made me stagnate; I was hesitant to go to college because I was comfortable where I was and I was so indecisive as to what I wanted to study. For about a year my routine has been: wake up, smoke, nap, go to work, and smoke again once I’m off. I have always had slight anger problems but I can’t help but feel like weed has made it worse, along with amplifying any depression I had (since I started smoking around puberty idk if it’s the weed or teen angst). 

I’ve been well aware of how detrimental weed was to me but my urge to smoke overpowered my rationality.  I have recently made the choice to quit because I noticed people leaving my life for various reasons along with spending well over half my paychecks on marijuana. Last night I smoked with one of my friends for the last time and gave him the rest of my weed so I wouldn’t be tempted to relapse. I intend to use this time of sobriety to save money, see if my personality improves, and figure out what I want to do with my life. 

Basically I’m posting this to seek advice on how to stay clean and occupy myself while sober, along with any other general suggestions on how to improve my life you guys may think are helpful. Sorry if this was all over the place I had many thoughts about this, thanks in advance!",7

Edit: I should also add that one of the reasons I've been able to abstain was because I wanted to have absolute mental clarity on an upcoming, very important assessment. That test was this morning.. so that burden being gone is making me think it doesn't matter, even tho it does.

I've long since escaped the situation, but never stopped smoking other than a 2 year break around age 20. I started a new life in a nearby state with nothing but the clothes on my back and eventually worked my way up from the bottom of the restaurant business to a server who could then afford basics. Somehow I decided to go back to school, graduated with an Associates from my community college and immediately transferred to the local University.   
Now I am one year away from graduating as an Electrical Engineer, never failed or dropped out any classes ever and I am more motivated than ever to graduate. Which is where the problem lies.....  


The weed smoking has to stop, I'm tired of studying twice as much to get less than spectacular test results. I didn't know why I started years ago (insane parents) but I know now, and I want to quit so I can be the best student/engineer possible, I want to quit so I can have a real relationships with the people around me.  
I just can't? I'm alone with very few friends and zero close friends and it makes the problem infinity harder to deal with as they either don't understand and judge me for it or they smoke themselves and can't relate/support.

  
I've started seeing the our campus provided therapist recently (scheduled for 2x a months, but the meetings so far are extremely short (1 hour )and  I'm doubting they will help me anytime soon. I started writing down every time I smoke and it helped for the first 2 weeks when I dropped it to 1 time per day. Unfortunately my girlfriend at the time decided she was fed up with my lack of intimacy and left me, and I spiraled into smoking multiple times a day.  


I told my dealer not to bring anymore by unless I say so, and have a vape pen with only than a few hits in it left. I'm planning on hitting it once or twice over next couples days before finally quitting for good. I'm deathly afraid that without support I am going to end up calling my dealer within the first few days of detox. I need advice, or support or something. PLEASE ANYTHING!!! I don't want to see my last big chance to get somewhere in life slip away AGAIN. 

Thank you for you're time and any advice!!!!!",18

From my experience, just stopping abruptly will only make you feel like you're losing a limb and will cause you to long for it. It needs to be gradual, else you'll find yourself slipping back in no time.",1

tldr: can you quit weed after abusing it for years then go back to managing it CORRECTLY months after quitting",4

I began smoking weed when I was 19 (2005). Started as a curious diversion, and manifested itself into an all-consuming addiction. Combined with World of Warcraft, I began to retreat from all aspects of my life school, working, social life.  

My life was just a rolling disaster with enough positive momentum to resemble a ""normal"" life. Moved out at 24-25, moved back in at 27. I would clear about an eight a week, limited by money. I went into debt, ruined potential relationships, squandered an education and just a lot of regret. 

At my lowest point - I was jobless, broke, no real social life, no car, no personality and no pursuits. I was a liar, an addict, depressed and a loser.

Porn, weed and Warcraft. 

I was not striving for any kind of improvement. Living at home, with nothing to look forward to except waiting for everyone to goto sleep, so I could get high and stay up to play WoW. 

I went to therapy in March 2013. Slowly, things began to improve. 

I got back into school and tried to be productive. 

I got a customer service job at a high end gym. 

I leased a new car, having my own wheels for the first time. 

Still smoking. Still playing WoW. Got a club card (California) because I was tired of waiting on dealers and wanted more control over my smoking. 

But I still wasn't fully clicking. I was still a loser. I needed a jarring change in my life. 

Enter pre-contemplation. 

I had always wanted to be in the military, but I never thought I could make it. I looked around, and decided I needed to prove to myself that I wasn't a loser, and that I could do something worthwhile. 

Transitioning to contemplation.

I told my parents that I wanted to become a United States Marine. They were skeptical that I had the commitment and capability to do become a Marine at 28 years old. I was too. 

Decision and action to get sober. April 28th 2013. My brother's birthday and season finale of Game of Thrones. 

It took about 3 months for me to pee clean for a drug test. Once I could do it reliably, I went into the recruiter's office. 

August 2014, I swore in.   
April 13th, 2015 I arrived to MCRD San Diego. 

Now, a Sergeant of Marines, I am potentially 6 months away from transitioning back to civilian life. I am going to pursue my goal of becoming a pilot, but in the event my flight officer package is denied *( I am an incredibly competitive aviation candidate, but shit happens)* I will get out and complete an engineering degree or be a heli-logging contractor and go to school part time. 

This is what **terrifies** me. The possibility of getting out, when I'm not sure that I am ready. 

I have gotten a lot of amazing, life changing experiences in the military and I want them to continue. 

Civilian life looks kind of boring now.

I won't have a circle of friends like I do now. 

My purpose will have to be self-defined. 

My identity and relation to the world will be super dynamic. (Rank & hierarchy expectations)

Stress and overthinking where what originally attracted me to marijuana. Being able to slow everything down, heighten sensations etc. It was a perfect drug for me. 

I wasted my 20s in my room, playing video games and jerking to porn. I still play video games and am trying to ween myself off porn. But I don't smoke. 

I don't want to get out and fall back into old habits.",7

2019-10-19 08:50:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dk3cgu/i_feel_anxious_and_exhausted/,I feel anxious and exhausted,"Hey guys,



I've been to this place months ago, when I quit weed the second bigger time in my life. Started again after a 2 months break or so.


I wanted to quit for some weeks, maybe even months now but never managed to make it over 2 days or so.


Whenever the temptation comes to write my dealer, it barely takes an hour and I fall for it.




Back when I started smoking I would NEVER consider smoking during the day, now it's 3 p.m. where I live and I'm already high.


I don't even enjoy this anymore. I smoke joint after joint, wasting money that isn't even mine (don't wanna go in too deep, but I'm a student and get support by my family but waste it for weed and bullshit).


All the time I'm waiting for that one special high, you know, like it used to be.


I spend much time inside, alone, listening to music, playing games, watching movies But none of it really has any substance to it.


I also produce music but I often find it hard to get into the creative vibes when I'm not high.




I know that it's usually just the first week that is so hard to overcome, but that's the week where everything comes up, my depression, my anger, my regret about all the bad things I've done, how I treat others etc.


And in a few moments of thinking about numbing myself again, it happens again.


I know it is a chain of events, not one single moment in which you fall. 
But I often don't find a real reason to quit.

Yes, I spend money that isn't really mine or at least considered to be wasted to such extent.
Yes, I miss classes because I'm going to bed in the morning and oversleep.
Yes, my life is boring and I basically waste my young age for nothing.



But as soon as those feelings arise, they overwhelm me so much and I get so anxious that I immediately just wanna get out, numb myself, forget everything around me. 
Be like a kid again.



Smoking weed, especially alone always gives me that feeling of living in the moment, what I don't really do otherwise.


I tried meditation before but it's difficult for me to do it frequently.



All I know at this point is that I want to stop, I want to quit, at least for a good amount of time, maybe even once and for all.

I'll try to take the days one after one and analyse my triggers.

I just hope and pray that I will stay strong in the tough times and remind myself why I want to stop.",5

During this period ive went on and off multiple times for various reasons. Ive come to realise that weed is really unhealthy to me and that it causes more bad than any good. 

This is probably my 15th attempt at quitting. Ive tried a lot of methods, did a lot of things to prevent me from falling back in and yet here I am today going at it again. 

Through the years, ive surrounded myself with friends and family members using cannabis daily. Its really hard to be around them because ive known them for so long and all they remind me of is smoking everyday. 

I know why I shouldnt use, I know how to stop using but somehow I keep falling back into the pattern. I think im just being weak mentally at this point. 

Im happy to be in a relationship with a girl who fully support me through my struggles. Shes a great inspiration and helps me with my resolve. Im blessed to have her in my life. 

I dont really look for any advice in particular im mostly here to vent. Thank you guys for being there!",12

I went out for a few drinks with a friend, the first time I've properly socialised since stopping. Bit risky with the alcohol but I've sailed through the past week with ease so I guess I was lulled into a false sense of security.

After 2 pints the cravings kicked in and it was all I could think about. I wasn't present with my friend at all... And the pub atmosphere was very draining to me. 

I had to use every single ounce of strength I had to just get a taxi home and not stop off at my dealers house to pick up. It was ridiculously hard. 

I mean I did it, and I'm feeling good that I got through the night without smoking. But I'm feeling pretty disheartened... Is that what it's going to be like every time I fancy a pint with my friends? The temptation to just stay in and isolate myself is overwhelming. At least on my own I can hack the cravings.

Words of inspiration and support are much needed... Thank you guys. X",13

At home. At school. I just think about the next high. I havent been to class since I smoked again. Normally no problem cause the work is all online, but it even made me not turn in work for school cause I was too busy being high to study. So I gotta make it out this time. I just gotta.

I think all that thc is finally out of my system now which is great, as I really struggled with withdrawals during the first month.

As I look forward, I almost feel it would be healthier for me to stop counting my days of sobriety. Initially I counted to motivate myself to continue, but now I’m worried that I’ll end up telling myself something like “hey you’ve gone 6 months sober, what can a little edible hurt?”. 

When I first quit, I did intend on learning to be disciplined with my use of weed and only use a handful of times during the year. Now I’m wondering if I’d be better off never using weed again, and if that’s even realistic for me. I guess anything is possible but I’m wondering how others feel about the thought of never using again? Is it liberating or daunting?",11

After I lied about my usage and it has gone to far. I have asked my girlfriend to help support me quitting. 
It has done nothing for me lately other than cause problems in my relationship. (I get guilty when I smoke and hide it from her, others in my family, co workers etc). When I get stressed out I immediately think about smoking weed and have to talk myself out of it. I know I can quit because I have before and it was easy but sometimes friends and influences around me make me want to smoke with them from just being around them and seeing the weed. I’m looking for some advice to stay clear from it, I have online classes to focus on and a full time job, probation and lots of responsibilities. I need as much support as I can get, today at work she sent me the app “grounded” and I seen this support group. Recently when I smoke all I feel is guilt, depression, really bad anxiety and paranoia but for some reason I still do it. Then I hide it from family, friends and my girlfriend. If asked about it I deny it. I don’t get it. Maybe I am addicted?
Anyway it’s been 12hours that I have been quit for and my goal is to quit indefinitely and become healthier mentally. I don’t want to keep smoking it isn’t enjoyable anymore unless I’m with the girl.

Like a flower, your scent alluring 

I can’t help but touch you

My love, deep within conjuring 

As I bring you to my lips 

I inhale your love with a kiss 

Your sweet ash coats my fingertips 

~

You came to me, in a dream 

A true natural beauty 

I fell for you, in your kiefy gleam 

As you shone in purple and green 

I needed to hold you close 

Even though you couldn’t be seen 

~

For three years now, you’ve been my love

It once a rare rendezvous 

Now every day, smoke rises above 

No matter cost, I must have you 

To keep close for lonely nights

My need as strong as gorilla glue 

~

In restless nights, you bring me sleep 

I could toss and turn for years without 

But with you, my love, I count the sheep 

Not only that, you help me eat 

I’d forget for hours, become so weak 

Now with you, my dear, I seek a treat

~

But let’s not forget, how you drain me so

My energy, gone in a flash 

And sleep is all I want to know 

I wish it didn’t have to be like this 

That I could have you and keep our bliss 

Yet you are an enemy to responsibility 

Once your kiss lingers here 

TV and food are the only possibility 

~

I must part with you, sweet love of mine 

You keep me from the real world 

This doesn’t mean you’re not divine 

Not all understand what you do 

Yes, you can make us lazy 

But the woes of life, you subdue 

~

Dearest Mary Jane, this is my farewell 

Maybe one day, our love will reignite

On a Jamaican beach or Miami motel

Regardless, you sensual ganja girl

I’m afraid this goodbye is genuine 

Until you’re understood by the world",8

I hated myself and had no social confidence or sense of self-worth. No one knew because I had perfected sober the art of masking my true feelings and bottling everything up inside so no one knew of the tormenting self-loathing I felt every day. I felt like they had given everyone the perfect how-to manual on life and left me out of the equation when the flyers were being passed out. I was still a virgin and had zero games with the ladies because my games were Halo and Super Smash Brothers Brawl front and center like any self-respecting nerd. I'll never forget the first time I met you Mary Jane in a Hollywood and Vine parking lot at 1 in the morning. That first touch of your sweet deceptively attractive aroma on my lips. The psychedelic tracers and utter euphoria that I suddenly couldn't live without music, whereas before I was utterly indifferent to the subject. That I lost my sexual virginity that same night because I discovered you made me popular with the women because you could make them feel euphoria too. I felt just like everyone else but even better, I finally had social confidence. Marijuana completed my soul and without her, I would have probably committed suicide from my already fatal alcoholism. Mary Jane truly saved my life because she made me not give a shit about alcohol anymore at all. I bought an entire ounce that same evening after my first time having sex.

&#x200B;

Kissing and reverently tonging the bag holding the magic Green goddess as my fountain of youth. Promising God that I would pathologically and religiously smoke marijuana every single weekend by the ounce until the very day that I died no matter what the consequences, and if anyone came between me and what I believed was the truest love, as gentle as pure spring rain that I would wreak unholy vengeance upon them forever! I was in love, true love, and I knew that I was a marijuana addict from the very first hit. I didn't care for shit; it was the best experience I had ever had in my life. Suddenly getting laid was easy as you made women want me. Suddenly my already vibrant creativity exploded and I was writing and painting at new levels I never conceived of before.  Suddenly I was sociable with everyone and no longer wanted to hide from people. Ganja was my medication and ganja was my ultimate cure, the solution to every single one of my problems! The first 1.5 years were the golden years of my pot-smoking career. I limited intake to weekends only, stayed otherwise sober and was killing it academically. I thought to myself, ""They lied to me about weed, said it would make me unmotivated and sluggish, what hogwash! I feel smarter, happier, stronger, better than my old self could ever be! This is who I want to remain for the rest of my life!""

&#x200B;

By the end of 1.5 years was when my love affair with Cannabis would go south for the next 7 to 8 years, where I lived in a religious denial of my addiction. Nothing came before Cannabis in my mind, absolutely nothing. I even interrupted sex in the middle of it just to be with you again. Mary Jane could do no wrong in my eyes and I refused to tolerate any criticisms of my habit, people would stab and betray me, but you would always be there for me in sickness and in health. But then something happened that I never saw coming. Ganja betrayed me. I became sluggish, paranoid, apathetic and unlike my true self, lazy and unmotivated because now you weren't my weekend fling, but an everyday date I couldn't let go of! I told myself daily that I would learn to moderate my time with you Mary Jane, but this was an absolute lie I sold myself so I could continue being a selfish pothead and prioritize you over everyone and everything else I loved and cared for. You took my money, my time, my dreams, my ambitions, my social skills, and my self-esteem in the end; whispering seductively that you would never betray me or hurt me in any way, you were there to make me feel happy never sad or empty. But you robbed me of my true potential, you chained me to your comfort zone. 

&#x200B;

You isolated me from everyone and everything else I love and care about, and I fell for your trickery and lost everything, all for you. You never loved me, you loved the money I spent on you and the time I wasted for you, but you never repaid the debt of $100,000 to $200,000 I spent without question just to continue our destructive marriage.  I wish I could tell you that I hate you now, but you will always hold a special place in my heart as being a fantastic drug when used correctly. But I hate what you reduced me too, I hate how you made me stagnant and complacent and forget my goals and ambitions. I hate the brain fog you left me with that makes me feel sluggish and stupid as I attempt for the millionth time to silence our relationship forever. And I want you to know that although we had many wonderful moments together that you are no longer serving me. You promised me a world you never truly delivered and I'm taking my power and control back from you. Don't expect me to return, I see through the lies you sold me and I want the real me back. Sobriety delivers what you promised but never gave me, and never will. I love you, but this is goodbye forever. I cannot use temperately as others can, so the option is forever off my table. Leave now, and NEVER COME BACK!!!",8

Does anybody else experience this? Do you guys have a solution?  Or will it go away in few days?

Also a little tip for relapsers, if you deeply disgust yourself from your stoner life, before quitting(Try to read as many posts here as you can while you’re high for the last time)I SWEAR TO GOD everything is 100x easier. 
After quitting dont think about past present or future or anything related to your quit. Just consider it as a shitty business trip that your boss asked and you dont have any other choice.
Also instead of smoking the last j and going the sleep, give at least 2 hours then go to sleep, you will experience a lot softer withdrawal symptoms on day 1.

True, i have had music explode into my ears in ecstasy once upon a time, but this was when I began smoking years ago. In more recent years i would keep searching and hoping music would affect me in the same way, trying to keep getting higher and higher so I could feel the same crazy emotions music used to give me while high.

But of course now that I am sober music is so much more crisp, much more emotive. I couldnt help but sob and laugh at the beauty of Across the Universe by The Beatles earlier today. This was the same sort of reactions to music I would have when I was just starting to get high.

If you're like me and absolutely loved listening to music while high, and you're afraid itll lose its magic when you stop, dont worry. It will be even better than when you're high because you will be able to listen to it more deeply, and be more present with the music. 

This goes for any form of media you like TV, video games, what have you. 

It really does not suck more when you stop. Depending on how much and how long you smoked, it may seem bland as your brain rewires itself. But I promise you, you will be surprised by how refreshing the media is that you're consuming. 

So so so much better than being half-there stoned out of your mind trying to experience that same feeling of those first highs. Fact is you will never get the same high of when you first started smoking. 

Life will take on a new brilliance when you stop. It may take a little time but it will. Best of luck, much love to everyone here.",11

This will be day 5 in a row spent in this fashion - wake and bake while chasing the high all day, via prerolls or carts.

I live with my parents. I landed back with them back in May and I've put off moving out because I'm saving up $ and biding my time to go on a 3 mo. road trip, starting in December.

I turn 26 tonight. I smoke weed every day, and have pretty much since I was sixteen. I feel emotionally stunted and trapped. I first started smoking weed to escape how living with my parents made me feel, and here I still am, a full decade later.

Here's some irony - I am a full time yoga instructor. I literally teach and lead people to be present, take responsibility for their own lives, and to love themselves. I know what I'm doing isn't working, and I'm shook at how much power I am surrendering to my habits, my past, and my circumstances.

I believe cannabis is a medicine, but I abuse that medicine. Side effects in my life that I'm aware of are: a crippling loss of drive/ambition of all kinds (sexual, social, career), insane fatigue (I can easily nap 5 hours/day), improper nutrition via munchies (can seriously fuck up a loaf of french bread real quick while high), a gnarly throatfeel, thousands of dollars over 10 years, 2 days jail time $7k fees via cannabis DUI when 18 (whole 'notha story, lmao), and I could go on, but fuck.

I turn 26 tonight. I am tired of living my life like I'm still 16. It's time for a change. If not now, when? Every day, every moment is an opportunity for change, but fuck, I love me some symbolism. Tomorrow is a new day

But I put the weed away at the suggestion of my therapist and here I am, finally crossing the threshold of weed-free days exceeding my stoned ones!

If you’re out there and down on yourself for caving to the temptation, don’t beat yourself up. It’s hard. I’ve had so many failed attempts I don’t even want to think about it. But just try it. Set some goals. Focus on a project or on achieving something you’ve always wanted to do but haven’t. Pick up a new hobby. Pick up the phone and reconnect with a friend or family member. Maybe get outside a little bit. 

You can reinvent yourself, no matter how much time you feel you’ve wasted. Don’t give up—I believe in you!

Today when I was ready to head down to the dispensary I remembered the feeling I’ve had in the morning lately. The feeling of being clear headed and awake. I always wake up so groggy and sad but these past 5 mornings have been easy for me.

I started smoking about 4 years ago after getting a doctor's recommendation and it legitimately helped my immediate concerns at the time. Well, I realize it made me accept things as-is and I was okay with it.  I was heavily dependent on alcohol, and I was able to quit drinking thanks to the help of cannabis.  Out of the two, alcohol was much worse for me so I feel that was the right decision either way, if I had to pick one.

Lately I've started questioning my cannabis consumption.  I'm about to begin a divorce and want custody of my son, and I feel that even though cannabis is legal in my state I'll still be looked at in a negative way. (It'd feel awesome to say ""go ahead, test me. I'm 100% sober."")  In addition, I've also kept my well-paying but boring job because I know it doesn't drug test.  Most jobs I'd want require security clearances and most likely would drug test.

So I've weighed the pros and the cons, and I feel quitting is the right thing.  The thing is, I have literally zero friends.  As an adult in my 30s I've been unsuccessful making friends.  I know that I've turned to cannabis and alcohol in the past as a way to get over the loneliness, and I don't know how I'll do that sober.  Every meetup seems to involve going to breweries or bars, or smoking cannabis.

Some things I've also realized may be related are that I get frustrated easily and don't know where to begin with things.  Like I get overwhelmed with life and just shut down.

I want to permanently quit weed, but apparently get a strong urge to party when i manage to quit for a few days. It was nice to be social again, admittedly.... but This kind of partying really takes a toll on my health- eventually i started smoking again to soothe my hangovers and now i'm back at chronic status. I just feel like partying when i sober up. Anyone else have this issue? i don't know why it happens, i literally never feel like drinking alcohol or doing drugs when i'm smoking a bunch of weed. i guess i just feel out of control when I sober up and make excuses to get f'd up on other things?  Maybe i like the adrenaline? i'm weak!   
sorry for the bad writing, i feel like i have about 3 brain cells right now

i feel like i need some real motivation to better myself when i sober up so i don't fall into bad habits. can anyone recommend some like, motivational podcasts or videos/content that helped them? i already exercise a lot and do tons of yoga so conventional suggestions like that aren't of a lot of use to me. I guess i need some deeper motivation to really address this issue.

TLDR: Quit weed for 10 days and ended up partying a bunch out of impulse and relapsed hard. looking for insight on how to avoid this and stay motivated sober",1
2019-10-17 17:04:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/djcq0q/day_21_17_yr_olds_experience_after_4_yrs_daily/,Day 21 (17 yr old's Experience after 4 yrs Daily Smoking!),"**This may look a long, intimidating post, but I promise that if you read through the whole thing, this may spark a new level of hope for all those still in early sobriety!**

So, I stopped counting the days. In my opinion, that is a great sign that I've truly started letting go of this habit/addiction. However, I counted the days since my last posts, and discovered I've hit day 21! By far the longest I've went in the past 4 years of abuse.

So much has changed in 21 days. The changes are incredible and overwhelming. Every week feels like a month, due to the constant change in life!

Throughout 4 years, I was the lowest I've ever been. I was ready to drop out of high school, failing every class from Freshmen to Junior year. My relationship with my girlfriend began to fall apart, and we had broken up; my first major heartbreak in life leaving me overwhelmed! I no longer enjoyed my many talents such as basketball, writing, making music, and singing. I was, although skinny, highly out of shape and weak. I felt like a worthless piece of plastic, floating and tumbling about the world, just waiting to be thrown away.

But I never lost sight of my ambition. When all else failed, I kept my hopes high. Even when I wasn't taking even a baby step towards improvement. Then something sparked.

After contemplating suicide at the local train tracks, I knew change had to happen.

I went to an inpatient mental health facility for 4 days. I detoxed from drugs, the main one of abuse being weed. And I also had a chance to step outside of my life and change some things.

And I learned I'd been struggling with severe ADHD all my life, and was self-medicating in order to treat that. And this caused so much depression, anxiety, shame, guilt, and self-hate. But I started ADHD medication, and it didn't get me high. But it gave me a reason to stay away from recreational drugs. I no longer had to continue this cycle of addiction. I was now actively treating my disorder.

When I got out of the inpatient facility, life began seeming more and more bright. I began taking my medication. I started lifting weights and running everyday. I connected with old friends I use to shut out in exchange for my stoner and alcoholic friends. I began playing basketball everyday. I started turning school completely around; to the point where I am now on track to graduate early, instead of drop out; thanks to the help of an alternative school.

I began eating a diet full of superfoods, and am now beginning to gain some size and muscle to my figure. I feel so much healthier and alive than ever. My depression has not subsided, but I now have the tools and coping skills to deal with them, instead of numbing them with drugs.

And what's made me the happiest so far, is that my relationship with my girlfriend is now back. Better than ever! And so much has changed since I've seen her last. I am no longer the bitter, depressed person she use to have to put up with. I found my own self-love. I use to love her more than myself. But I've recovered.

And I now love writing again, making music, and playing basketball. My passions are the lifeblood of me!

The first 2 weeks were hell; I hated life sober. But I love it now! I will admit, life has its' challenges being sober. But challenges are fun! They make you grow and develop, and find new better places in life! When you're a lazy stoner, you become bored, depressed, and spiteful of life.

But it's safe to say, that after 21 days, the only direction I can see life going, is up!

Take this as motivation, fellow teenagers. Even to those young adults, and people of any ages! There is hope! I use to look at posts of people like this for motivation! But it's now safe to say, I'm living proof of that hope! So go out there and be a fucking boss! Quit weed! And never look back! You got this!

**Peace, love, and positivity:)**",2

i realize now that weed withdrawals are real. when i'm sober i feel bored, irritated, and moody. that's why i can't last a week because i feel so awful without it, but now that i know, i'm going to try my best to stay sober. i'm so glad i found this community. i don't feel so alone now :)",6

I can’t just do something because I enjoy it or I think it’s cool, if it’s not something “worthwhile” I opt out of doing it. This a horrible place to be as it makes just about anything (like going to the gym, being better at my job, and so on) impossible to stick to. This is one of the things I look forward to working on most while quitting, being okay with improving in something just because I enjoy it.",27

2019-10-17 15:08:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/djb1hb/6_months_cleani_want_to_smoke/,6 months clean...I want to smoke.,"I stopped 6 months ago, almost 7 now. It was bad. I was staying up very late, smoking so much, not even getting high, not sleeping well, not eating well, extreme anxiety and mood swings. Scraping by at work, zero productivity outside of work and strained personal relationships.

&#x200B;

I should realize that I cannot go back to smoking. But I don't.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I got a call from a medical delivery company asking if I'd like to place an order, they were trying to drum up business I guess and they had my info from months ago. I quickly said no and hung up but I can't stop thinking about it now. I just want to order one little gram. Just to smoke on Friday night.

&#x200B;

In these 6 months, I have progressed a lot. I secured a job and in turn, got a promotion. I feel better, life is a lot easier without shame anxiety and sleep deprivation. 

&#x200B;

My husband will not tolerate me smoking. He recently quit his job and is going back to school full time while I support us on my measly salary. I just want to escape. The worst part is he would be totally fine with me drinking and I started drinking more this summer (recently quit again) because I honestly hate drinking and all the unhealthy effects of it. I'd much rather be high.

1. Anxiety has decreased tenfold (no longer have a shit load of thoughts racing through my mind after every social interaction) 

2. Showing more compassion (this includes being more compassionate to myself) 

3. No more shame or guilt in regards to wasting all my income on weed. 

4. More self respect -which makes others respect me more.

5. Better sleep/dreams 

6. Better outlook on life (I think this stems from being tired all the time when smoking. You’re not really angry at anyone, you’re just so fucking tired all the time and have low energy so of course you’re going to be irritable and see life as a drag because all you want to do is smoke and do the bare minimum.) 

7. I can feel my depression starting to lift. 

8. Less bitching 

9. Less sensitive to everything 

10. No more thinking that everything is a personal attack. 

11. Less stressed out at work. 

12. Acknowledging that my job is temporary and I don’t need to stay here forever. 

13. Head feels clear

One benefit that I’m waiting for is smoother social interactions. When I was smoking, I’d usually get social anxiety when interacting with others even when completely sober. Now I don’t have any anxiety at all BUT I still find it challenging to keep up with and hold conversations. I honestly feel a bit stupid like my brain is broken lol I hope this passes.

In that time I started seeing a therapist about my mental health issues, I got to a weight where I was actually happy with how I looked for the first time in years, and I met a girl who I started to fall in love with.

Unfortunately I took this progress as a sign that I was over my addiction and in charge of my life. I went to Denver a couple weeks ago on vacation and ended up buying a bunch of wax cartridges. I was thinking “I’ll just use it on occasion, treat it like I do alcohol”. Well I got back and the girl I was falling for left me because she had to focus on her own life, I started smoking daily, and I’m back to looking at myself in the mirror and hating what I see. 

I was laying in bed this morning putting off my responsibilities as I do every day now, and thought to myself: this is too much. It’s crazy that I went so far with sobriety and then fell right back into the hole that I was climbing out of. I am completely out of motivation and am hating every second of my life. I feel like the world is pushing me down as hard as it can and I’m just barely standing.

It started as something to help me relax, the occasional blunt, but soon evolved into something more sinister. I would bring weed with me everywhere. I couldn’t function unless I was high. My tolerance was through the roof, meaning I was spend an absolute fortune on weed. 

The worst of it, however, was how it altered my mind. I could no longer recall events that happened days or weeks ago- let alone years. I felt unmotivated, paranoid, and reluctant to do anything besides smoke all day and play video games. I wore weed clothing, started on bongs, and would not shut up about all things weed (yes, I was THAT person) 

I decided to quit alongside my boyfriend around 3 years ago as we both realised it wasn’t doing us any good. However, I did relapse a year ago and start smoking again for a short stint after convincing myself that I could just have one smoke, occasionally. (Spoiler: I couldn’t) 

Luckily, that didn’t last long- around 6 months. Relapse is part of recovery after all. 
I’ve gained 80% of my mental clarity back, and my bank account definitely thanks me. 

My crutch is now the gym, and I reward myself with food or clothing, or gaming time rather than a blunt. 
I hope this helps anyone who is struggling with relapse or quitting, as it’s truly worth it in the end.",43

I'm starting to feel like I'm part of the human race again, you know! 
Like I can look at people in the eye and have a conversation without worrying about if my eyes look stoned and slow and drugged up. 

I don't have to hide the smell of my cigarettes either because there's no weed in them. 
Just little things I've noticed like these all add up to a much more peaceful day to day life. 

I'm starting to get out of bed again at a reasonable time in the mornings as well. I can't say my dreams are intense to be honest, although that might change yet 

I left the window open last night and woke up freezing cold. I think that's why I'm not drenched in sweat this morning. I think i went through one t-shirt change last night though, but I honestly can't remember, heh. 

My appetite is probably at around 80 to 90 percent of normal. Still some upset stomach issues but only in the morning. 

I'll hopefully have the energy to start weight lifting tomorrow morning. I do a physical job though so I get a fair amount of exercise at work. 

Hope you are all pressing through those first few days. After day 4. It started to get easier!

I live with them and they keep pretty close eyes on me. I’m 19 so this doesn’t feel good at all. They are also going to be consistently drug testing me. 

I guess this is partially a good thing because I’m being held accountable but I feel so alone and the only way I know how to deal with that is smoking weed. Being told I had to stop kind of made me begin to have suicidal thoughts. I know that’s dramatic but it’s how I’ve been coping with all of my struggles. 

I resent them so much. I feel like I’m in a prison. It’s been almost 4 days. This is the longest I’ve gone without smoking in a long time. It makes it so much harder that I didn’t choose to let it go. I thought about having a final smoke where I get super high, but now that I have already started my break, I don’t want to break that. 

These past few days have been some of my hardest ever, and my high school got shot up, so if that tells you anything. I know it’ll get easier, but I feel like I wouldn’t even have to go through this if I just hid from my parents better.",2

personal info time here: i've struggled with BED (binge eating disorder) since i can remember- at least a decade at this point. BEFORE weed, i would usually have some sort of huge binge a night or two a week that was balanced out by the other 80% of the week when i was eating next to nothing. once i tried smoking, i was able to binge with NONE of that sweet sweet ED guilt. the munchies were \*fun\* and \*normal\*, but it slowly but surely got me into a pattern where i was able to live in ignorant bliss of the extremely unhealthy lifestyle i was living (think 2000+ calories every single night, on top of anything else i ate that day, for a year). i noticed after about 6 months the amount of weight i had put on, and this pattern just kept repeating itself. by the time i caught on, though, it was way too late. i got totally dependent on it to kill that feeling of guilt that comes with eating food, no matter how much my self esteem was tanking as i noticed something else from my closet wasn't fitting the way it used to (or just not fitting at all). 

i don't want to turn this into a bunch of body image talk (i read the rules but for some reason i still feel like maybe this post might not be up to code) but i need to write this all out so i can hold myself accountable. smoking weed has made me feel like shit about myself. i look in the mirror and don't recognize myself anymore. i barely leave the house because i'm so embarrassed about the weight gain, and when i do, i'm constantly worried about seeing anyone who hasn't seen me in a few months bc i know they'll be able to tell how much i've put on. i'm ready to stop and i hope that putting something here will help set things in motion for me. and if anyone else here has been in a similar spot, or is in one right now, any words of encouragement would be much appreciated.

I really don't know where to go with this post, or even who will read it but I need help. I can quit because of supply (if I don't have I don't actively search for/do) but when I get weed, my carnivourous instinct kicks in and I need to be high whenever I can. What do you guys do to get over this? 

Secondly, I need help finding a reason to quit, I think if I have goals and a set in place overarching objective as to why I'm quitting it'll help out. I don't truthfully know how y'all could help with that but anything is appreciated.

Lastly, I'd love someone to talk to through this process. I really don't think I can do this alone as I've depended on it daily for years now. I promise I'm not some weirdo I just need support.

Going to bed sober tonight, but questioning if this is all worth it","I got kind of triggered by a podcast today were the host was talking about how she healed a lot of her chronic health issues by just relaxing and not being so strict with her diet, drinking some beers if she wanted to etc. I was really resonating and relating to a lot of what she had to say but in the end when she was talking about having a beer I was like “fuck! I want a beer!” (I’m two months off alcohol and 26 days off weed.) After listening to that I’ve been thinking a lot during the day and questioning wether this sobriety is worth it. I feel like I’m cutting myself off from pleasure. But I also recognize that this is probably just my inner addict wanting to smoke again. And I know I have serious issues with moderation. I don’t think the host of said podcast had any issues with substance addiction. Which I know to some extent I definitely do. I feel like I got good info out of the podcast but fuck I feel triggered to smoke now. Not going to tonight though, and we’ll see how I feel when I wake up in the morning.

It’s that urge like “damn I want to get high and feel good for the moment “ but deep down I know it’s very likely that “moment “ will turn into craving it stronger and stronger everyday and being back in the cycle everyday. There’s a part of me that’s like fuck it though I don’t care. But there’s another part that’s like No! You got this you’ve made it 26 days (longest I’ve gone in like 6 years) Keep going!

Ramble-y post but it’s late and I just need to get these thoughts out. Thanks

Edit: Right now/today/tonight I’m feeling like I’m getting too neurotic and strict with my lifestyle with my diet (no gluten no dairy ) no drinking no weed. It’s like fuck maybe all these restrictions are just making things worse. I want to live and enjoy life. 

Most of all I’m just trying to heal my physical (mostly stomach/digestive issues but also general body tension) and mental (anxiety/depression) health

I've been paying him $3 a bowl...I've even stolen it a couple times and paid him back discreetly. I can't seem to get it under control. The temptation is too strong, it seems.

I'm behind in college because of this shit. Now I'm almost completely caught up so I don't stay any extra semesters, but here I am late on sooo many fucking assignments and have no motivation to do them at all! I'm so close to graduating...and I'm about to completely botch it if I don't get my shit together.

I need help y'all. How the heck do I quit this shit for good while I have all the accessibility to it? I used an app to help before with the 8 months, but it seems to be doing nothing for me now. What techniques have helped you: striving and thriving people out?

I mostly smoke in the evening when I've lost all my motivation to do work and be a student. I'll smoke, enjoy the ride for a little while, then sleep just go to tomorrow when I hope I'll have more motivation to do something. How do I avoid this?

I hope I can quit for good soon. Idk if it's doing me any good right, but I think I'm so hooked I can't face the reality that I shouldn't smoke...

So I have been sober for 22 days now and I notice some good changes that comes with time. First off I haven't cried in the last 7 days which is great! The morning sweats have subsided and the nausea and headaches are gone. Now I know when people say get through the first week and things start to feel better, it will. Maybe not one week for everyone but hang in there!!!! 

The biggest change I'd have to say is that my husband said to me today that I've been much happier since I've quit smoking pot. Wow!! I never thought in a million years that I'd be happier WITHOUT WEED!!!  I do feel happier because I don't have to worry about when I'll get my next fix or freaking out when I ran low, and finding the money to spend on it. It is so freeing to be in control again. It has been a very long long time since I felt this control. 

Exercise does help! I've been walking every evening for a minimum 30 mintues each night. The evenings are the worst for me when it comes to cravings. I thought weed was the only way for me to relax at the end of the day but guess what, it's not. Even work is easier for me now, I don't get so annoyed with people and I find it easier to get through the day.  Oh and my dreams have been awesome now! I get excited to go to sleep and dream because who knows what my brain will think of tonight.

If you are struggling with quitting, I know you can do it. If you really want it deep down inside, you will achieve it.  Instead of saying this is hard everyday, tell yourself instead that it's not always going to be hard. I would love to message with someone either daily or a few times a week so we can share our experiences and stories because when you have someone who can relate, you don't feel so alone!

But it seems once the balls rolling it does get easier. I know for certain weed literally is destroying my mind. During work today I had random anger and sadness pop up over events that happened years ago. Goes to show how weed really does stuff your emotions down inside you. 

It's hard to quit knowing you will inevitably face pain. It took me multiple tries until frankly I had gotten basically rejected yesterday by a girl of my interest. That was a strange catalyst for me, because she said she would like to but she has so much stuff in her life she needs to figure out before she can get interested in relationships. And I was sad but I knew what she said was right and it pertained to myself so obviously as well. I need to get my shit together. It was easy to not smoke that day because I wanted to feel that sadness of rejection, among other things. 

If I had to give advice to someone having difficulty getting through the first 24 hours, I'd say expect and even desire the pain if you can. Think of it as a cleanse, you gotta get all this shit you've had pent up for however long now out. I know I'm not in a great position to be giving advice as I literally have 1 day under my belt, but that's just my 2 cents.

So for today I am going to a Buddhist center near me to meditate then tomorrow is my first day of therapy. I have so much baggage that i know i need to face. I dont desire weed at the moment, but when the desire comes I am hoping i will remember - it is cancer for my mind, and at the stage in my life there is absolutely no benefit I get from smoking. And conversely so many doorways and avenues open up for me to live a beautiful and satisfying life as a non-smoker. When phrased like that, I rejoice in my decision to quit, not mope about it. This is a wonderful thing for me. I can finally berid myself of this horrible cloud constantly hanging over my head.

I wasn’t a do nothing stoner in high school, i was a tri-varsity athlete who was in AP art and lead role in the musical but i smoked more and did less in college. I was in a solid program for Bio-medical engineering and was doing well until I started smoking more after a bad breakup and stopped caring about anything. Smoking everyday playing xbox and VR religiously. I started failing out and my parents found out after they called out my lying to them. They pulled me out and im living at home in community college as a first year with so many credits over well 100thousand  maybe even 200. Looking at it makes me itch to just smoke. Depressed at the catastrophic fuckup i am I started to smoke daily again and started fucking up in math again. Angry at myself i can get a real job because I couldn’t pass a drug test. I can hardly keep a schedule. No friends to talk to, no motivation, no hopeful outlook. But I’ve been sober for two days.
All my best memories are from my “high” jinks with my friends and brother. Now i don’t really hear much from them. Looking back a lot of my memories are fuzzy, ive been getting stoned and playing video games for an absurd amount of my youth that i can hardly recognize a version of myself without this. I kind of hate it. I look at others i grew up with, younger and more accomplished. I feel like i have nothing to show for myself

I dont even know not being stoned is going to help but im really tired of feeling mentally slow. This shit runs deep and its not the first time im trying to stop but ive been cutting down the past two weeks and i really need to get a handle on my life. I used to and still kinda think of weed as a joke of a drug. But looking back, every holiday, social event, vacation or day at the park revolved around weed for me otherwise is was irrelevant and to be avoided. 

Im actually terrified to venture out into this very uncomfortable sober world. Im scared its just as lonely and depressing as the one im constantly running away from. 

Im scared really fucking scared, of this debt, of my future, and of the potential im missing out on. 

Im scared I could make it work too, move to a state like Massachusetts where I wouldn’t have to worry about a drug test and I could find a balanced stoner lifestyle working with tech. 

But i find myself really questioning some of my beliefs . I used to think it wasn’t addictive, that “i only smoke the weed i dont let the weed smoke mee!!” Its bullshit. It burt me out and turned me into a zombie. But i still LOVE IT. few things i feel more fondly about then that glorious smell of cannabis, i want it. I need it. Stop! 

I think thats the addiction talking , trying to work MY LIFE around IT . WTF am i doing, its just a plant, why do i need it so much?? 

I really do want to get my head clear. The last time i went a month without smoking i must have been 17 ive gone weeks or two without it  but always came back. 

Ive been stoned so long I hardly remember why i feel so compelled to smoke. Then I remember how much ive let slip through my fingers while i was stoned and i get so angry and depressed with myself. Depressed I don’t even have friends to smoke with anymore. Making want to get high more then anything and forget about it.

If things keep going this way I’ll only lose more. A bleak future if i keep getting stoned and remaining mentally checked out. 

TLDR: I never really took my cannabis/videogame addiction seriously and realized escaping “the stress of school” took more from me then I ever imagined.

Any help and support appreciated",3

So I've been smoking since I was 19. I'm (M) 23 now and will be graduating college in May. When I started smoking, I went crazy with it, eventually I had a nervous breakdown and began cutting back, but I still managed to smoke daily. This past year, I've been working on my mental and physical health. I have cut back tremendously—only smoking a max of one bowl a night, but I'm hitting a block in my mental health; I'm not getting better, I'm not getting worse. I'm just stuck. 

I think it's the pot. I have always wanted to stop because I honestly hate being high after the first 30 - 45 mins... The shit just makes me so sleepy nowadays. And if I am high, I can't read or meditate because my focus is compromised. I'm also deeply spiritual and what happens is I will schedule my smoking time around my spiritual pursuits, but that makes me guilty because I'm prioritizing pot above my spirituality, which for me is not a good idea. Sometimes I feel like I'm a caged rat and marijuana is the lock, keeping me imprisoned. 
For the longest, I've used the excuse of ""It helps my anxiety!"" And sure it does help in the moment, but not in the long term. 

It's time for change. I don't want to be a zombie anymore. I want to be awake and clear headed. I want to get high on the beauty of life all around me, not a drug. 
Here's the obstacle though, my boyfriend of 3 years smokes daily and has no intention of stopping. He is aware of my feelings towards pot and has agreed to not smoke around me or encourage me to smoke, but it's still hard not to join him. One of my flaws is that I am a follower, not a leader. I tend to follow the crowd and do what everyone around me is doing. I've gotten better at this, but not with my home life. If my boyfriend is smoking, I want to smoke. And it's hard to keep myself from it. But I know I have the inner strength to say no. I can do this, I know I can. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for your support.

TL:DR I was craving weed so I walked my dog and started a journal 

Day 1: 12:00 P.M.

     I began to desperately crave Ms. MJ's blissful ignorance about an hour or so ago. In an effort to fight my urges I did something new, by simply walking my dod to the dog park, and letting him roam it for a while. Although I was still thinking about pot and the effect that it has on me, I was able to get out of the mindset of actually wanting to smoke by the time I made it back home.
     After making my way back home, I decided to browse Reddit as a source of entertainment and distraction, when I happend upon this page. After scrolling through the discussions and reading the journeys of others I decided to start a public journal about my own experiences. I would love tips on quitting if anyone has any. Thanks for the read!

I was scared to speak up for myself out of fear what other people might think. I went from being an alpha dawg in high school (even though I didn’t even know it) to being a beta lil bitch because of my addiction to weed. It made me feel indifferent about everything. I wanted to be cool with everyone. Even with the people who didn’t deserve my chillness. Because I was indifferent with people, this soon manifested into me being indifferent with everything else. People began thinking that my opinion didn’t matter because I’m chill no matter what. “He doesn’t care anyway.” My communication skills suffered over the years and I was unable to say how I was feeling about certain things. So when I would get  drunk, a lot of these emotions would come out that had been suppressed from chronic weed usage. I got into fights with friends who were never really my friends. And they didn’t know they weren’t my friends because I was to afraid to express my true feelings about them because I was indifferent about everything. I’m done with that shit. I’m done with weed. I’m speaking my mind and I’m going to become whatever the fuck it is I want to be in this life. FUCK WEED. Day 23 let’s get it.",29

2019-10-16 13:18:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dishi5/day_3/,Day 3,"It’s probably useful to start this post off by saying i haven’t been completely sober these three days, but the distinction is that i haven’t bought any for myself and have only smoked a couple times socially in that time.

This is a drastic step for me considering for the past 5 years i’ve pretty much been high morning to night non stop. 

It’s hard to completely quit, especially when in college surrounded by the party atmosphere and being a part of a fraternity, but this is something that i’m aware that i have a problem with that i need to get under control, so here i am. I’m hoping to continue tapering off and only smoke in rare social occasions. 

Interestingly enough, the little bit that i did partake in over the last few days was much more satisfying than being high 24/7. It felt like more of a reward for being sober the rest of the day and being productive in that time rather than being stoned all day and feeling guilty that i didn’t get as much done as i would’ve liked. For me, i used to use because i was “unhappy” with my life. Then, weed became the problem that was making me unhappy after i left the situation i was previously in. Since college started i have more heavily started to realize the negative effects that my constant smoking is having.

Overall, my three days of (semi) sobriety isn’t a major accomplishment, but in my life this is a big step towards getting to where i want to be. i’m confident that i am on the right path and at this point feel like i am starting to become more in control of this addiction rather than it being control of me. 

some benefits i’ve noticed in this short period of time:

-Increased applicable energy and motivation throughout the day. weed always gave me energy/motivation, but only to do pointless things like video games/watching tv/playing on phone. i would then spend hours doing these activities and procrastinate my important work. 

-My days have been a lot more productive. in these past three days i’ve managed to catch up on a lot more work that i was behind on and do a lot of the planning for things that should’ve been planned weeks ago. this probably goes back to the increased energy

-Better social interactions and empathy towards others. when i would smoke 24/7, this and my own personal issues/work/classes, etc,  were the only things that mattered. After class, meetings and work, i would be itching to leave so i could go home and smoke some ganj and be lazy in front of my tv. now i am better able and more motivated to actually interact with my peers and have conversations with them. INTELLIGENT conversations at that. we may think we are geniuses when we have these “highdeas,” but i feel much more able to have good conversation about topics of interest when i’m sober, and better able to remember facts i wouldn’t have if high. I even spent an hour helping a random stranger with a project for a class that i took last semester which is not something i’d normally be willing to do

cons: 
-can’t sleep without melatonin which makes me groggy in the morning
-still very bored during my free time
-not hungry whatsoever

i know these cons will pass with due time though, and the pros much outweigh the negatives of quitting. i’m excited at the prospect of beginning my new life not being high all day.

Thanks to anyone who gave this long post a read and thank you all for being active in this community and supporting each other. this sub is a large part of what gave me the motivation to make this change in my life.",2

i just wanna share a bit. I'm 29 and i've smoked for 10 years more or less, and smoked around 10 joints (or more, and quite strong too if i hear correctly from my friend) for 2 years.

I've quit since july and only smoked 1 day in september. But it's getting worst now. I'm more isolated, i can't stand to see friends or family, i feel anxious like hell, having nightmare almost every nights and i'm barely eating.

I have depression, among other things, and i've quit smoking weed because i'm poor as hell and i canno't afford it anymore. But this isn't helping me at all. I canno't enjoy videogames anymore and the only thing that keep motivating me is my girlfriend and the fact that i can afford little presents for her and for me from time to time.

I just wan't to go back to my old routine: smoking from morning to the night helped me having social interactions and i wasn't lazy at all; i could enjoy having a beer, making a great dinner or tinker things. It helped me having some kind of project too: like finding a job or going back to university. But now i'm just wandering all day long, waiting for my girlfriend to be willing to watch a tv show or a movie.

I've gotten everything back and better than ever - great stress-free living situation, a far superior money situation (amazing how much you save when you're not dropping hundreds a week on weed), relationship with the family better than ever, and I'll be getting off probation in a couple months. My probation officer barely even comes by and when he does it's very friendly because he knows I'm serious about making a change and I've accepted responsibility for what I've done. What makes this period of sobriety different than all the previous ones is that **I am done** smoking. I'm not white knuckling it, I genuinely do not want to see it, smell it, and least of all smoke it ever again. It took 12 years to get it but like my judge told me, some people never get it. I'm so glad I don't have to spend upcoming holidays either back in the lockdown medical facility or in jail or prison. 

It is an absolute privilege to be free. To drink coffee, to have a comfortable bed, to have a hot shower, to be able to watch TV, and shit, just to be able to be outside in nature with trees and fresh air. You never know what you have until you lose it. Not a single one of these things is worth giving up just so I can fry my brain with weed, and for me, and my personal reactions on it, I'd lose them all. I was very lucky and fortunate to receive probation on this last case, and best believe I will never be entangled in the legal system again. Hopefully you all can find strength and inspiration. I completely understand the difficulty of picturing going the rest of your life without weed, but as they say, just for today. Just for today I stay clean because that I can control. And wouldn't you know it, the craving has long since passed by then. God willing I can say just for today everyday for the rest of my life.",7

It really motivated me to finally quit smoking weed myself. I want to do it ""right"" from the beginning and maybe some of you can tell me what helped you in the first days of soberness. I'm also going to share my story of weed-smoking (sorry for spelling errors etc, english is not my first language):

I started smoking weed when i was 15 (23 now). At the same time i also started smoking cigarettes, and basicaly all my friends did too. It went from only smoking on weekends and never having any weed myself to smoking everyday and paying alot for it in about a year. After turning 17 i was already addicted, but i didn't realise or care. I was in the classic ""Weed is so good everyone should smoke all the time, it's so harmless""-phase. Funny how i thought i wasn't addicted, when i litteraly searched every fucking centimeter in my room for a little weed when i didn't have any left.

So I started my apprenticeship and was completely useless, because i was high from lunchbreak until i went to bed at night. I also didn't earn a lot of money and wasted so much on weed. I live in central europe where smoking weed is illegal (no one really cares though as long as you don't smoke next to a police officer), it's easily accessible but quite expensive.

So my boss at the time caught me smoking and basically said ""if you don't stop, you're fired and have to look for a new apprenticeship"". I was 18 at the time and it was my first (and honestly last) real attempt at quitting weed. It worked wonders, i went 3 weeks sober and out of nowhere i was a really good worker (i never was dumb, just high all the time). It wasn't easy, I was sweatting a lot while sleeping. I started to smoke again but not as much and I didn't have a lot of cravings anymore. I again smoked daily, but only one medium joint half an hour or so before i went to bed. We call that the ""guetnacht"" in switzerland, which translates to ""good night"", so a joint you smoke before you go to bed. This one on the other hand was still a must have, i slept really really bad when i didn't smoke a guetnacht.

What i did was starting to drink alcohol too, so joints (besides the guetnacht) weren't as ""important"" anymore. So I formed a habit of drinking 2-3 beers a day and smoking that one joint before going to bed. So as you can guess it wasn't just enyoing weed (or alocohol) anymore, it was to stop thoughts i didn't want and forgetting about my problems instead of dealing with them. So what happend was that i had this sort of combination of smoking and, most of the time, drinking every day but to a degree were it didn't have a big enough impact to fail at my job. I did this for a long time and about a year ago, when I was 22, I decided to drink less as i felt it became very unhealthy.

As soon as I drank less I had the urge to smoke more, to get more of that ""not thinking about anything"" state. Btw I never went back to smoking at work or other important events etc. but I went back to smoking a lot after work.

And here I am, 23 years old and smoking 1-4 joints everyday after work, sometimes drinking too. What pushed me the most to the descision to quit is that I clearly don't enjoy smoking as much as I did, I mostly use it to get away from every day stuff and get in a better mood. Don't get me wrong i love weed and I love smoking when I'm in a positive state of mind and I really think it's not that bad if you smoke a joint from time to time and enjoy it. But unfortunately, most of the time, that's not me. You know what sucks the most? I never really learned how to deal with problems appropiately, I always took the shitty but easy route with weed and alcohol. That's the biggest and most important reason for me to quit, my life has been some sort of a mess for the last 5 years, with me just holding everything together, but not enjoying it at all. And i think the core of it is my addiction. The reason why i never did it is because i'm scared to get to know my real self. I feel like i never was myself since i got addicted and it realy feels like i wasted a lot of some of the best fucking time in my life, aged between 18 and 23. Weed (and sometimes alcohol) were always more important, I runied relationships with friends, a girlfriend and even relatives. It feels like for the last 5 years, I was just here on planet earth. Not more, not less, I was just here ""living"". I think the most interessting thing is that your mind tricks you in believing weed is the only thing that you have in your life that is truly a blessing, but it's actually the one thing that takes all the other potential blessings away from you.

Now to get back to the guetnacht: I think this will be the biggest challenge. The amount of days without a guetnacht in the last 3 years is probably about 10, and always when i was abroad with people who don't smoke. It's like I'm not that addicted to weed trough the day, but then I'm craving for this guetnacht.

If you read all this, thank you, just that means a lot! So anyone here who had the same difficulties with smoking before going to sleep? Or do you have any tips / made experiences regarding the first few days after quitting?",2

Thank you all again for the birthday wishes yesterday. I never thought a group of strangers on the Internet could change my mood and give me a sense of community, but it truly did. 

So, anyway. I'm still changing t-shirts in the middle of the night due to waking up soaked in sweat. I think that's improving though. I wasn't drenched last night, just wet around the coller and stuff. 

My moods remain fairly stable but still up and down a bit. Especially when I start thinking about things i need to buy and debts and bills i need to pay with money I haven't got, thanks to my disease/addiction. 

But anyway I'm doing my best saving what i can. I used to spend at least £105 a week on weed. Plus all the alcohol i was drinking most nights. 

I've cut back to smoking half cigarettes instead of whole ones, like I've done before. And I'm bringing the amount down to a few a day. I'm reasonably happy with that. I'm not bothered if i ever completely quit cigarettes, I think it's a bit of a tall order for an addict like me, I dunno. I feel I need something, ya know?!

Hope everyone is recovering well?

#The story, summarized

I was never in any contact with weed, neither directly nor indirectly, for a very long time. This changed some time after smy dungeons and dragons group started. I invited a friend over to game with us. I felt she was a good fit, and she invited a friend of hers over as well. We had a nice group of 6 people.

And for a decently long time, all was well.

But at some point, weed became a staple topic. No problem there, not at the time. It was brought up more and more often, and I couldn't talk given my lack of experience. I decided I would play devil's advocate a couple times, just to get the discussion a bit more scientific. This fell flat in an interesting way.

What was really happening I didn't notice until a few months before the end. I was always playing the dungeon master, so I really got to experience everything that happened around the table. And slowly but surely, the way the game was played changed. As in, somehow, every session involved a discussion about weed about halfway through. It was almost like an idol, people turned up high more and more often, and this all came to a terrifying climax.

One day, I wasn't there, so I guess this was motivation for them to both smoke and eat weed way too much. This led to one of my friends turning bleak and falling to the ground. Nobody reacted. No humanity at all (this I recently discovered after talking to the only sober person in the room). They all went home safely thankfully. But it was a weird, surreal thing to hear about, let alone experience.

I myself could have gotten high trice. Once I took a quarter of a light edible, which didn't do anything. Other people did get high, and that's when I realised how antisocial the drug is. Talking was impossible. Nobody had any focus at all. So I left. Second time, I just didn't eat it. Didn't want it.again, noticed a total lack of understanding and empathy. Nobody even asked why I didn't.  They just shrugged it off. Gave it to a friend, and when I asked it back a few minutes later, he refused, which was very much unlike him. Last time, I was pushed way too hard into taking the same shit that caused the last paragraph, and that's when I noped the fuck out.

Smoking was out of the question, given that would send me to the hospital within an hour (if I'm lucky enough for someone to bother calling an ambulance). Lung problems from birth. Which were completely denied by the worst offender.

#Observations

What I didn't realise is that for over a year I've been experiencing people falling into an addiction, and I've been seeing the effects of weed abuse. The first person I invited claimed to have anxiety and depression, and that weed helped her. Supposedly, her psychologist told her she should use it as well, which I know is a lie; that's not allowed. People denied the effects, to the point that one person claimed the only effect of weed is just bad short term memory for a while. ""That's fucking it."" It wasn't fucking it.

I've witnessed my friends mentally deteriorating, becoming less and less social, showing less and less empathy and eventually choosing a plant over friends.

And experiencing that is a lot more difficult than I realised in the moment. I lost 5 of my best friends because drugs became more important than caring for others.

So I needed answers. Why did this happen? Was it me all along? I was told I must have HPD, and after some asking around, the conclusion is that I'm the opposite of HPD. So I started researching weed and realised I recognised something. In fact, I recognised a lot.

I realised I literally saw someone fall into paranoia. I saw people isolate themselves. I saw people fail to deal with stress and unable to deal with problems. One was a college dropout, another couldn't hold an internship and was first sent away after a day for a week, and removed entirely after the next week. Someone is entirely isolated already and nobody in that group even knows what he is up to.

It took a threat to my health to realise how fucked up this was, and when people started to dismiss the threat despite it being put in plane sight, I realised this was problematic and things had to change. This ended up with me leaving.

#Effects on me

This is when I ended up here. I wanted to know what weed did, and I went on a long journey to figure it all out. Science helped, but what helped more is the stories here. Behaviours I recognised. Stories that hit close too home.

I wasn't crazy and it wasn't me. There are more people dealing with the problems I saw developing. Especially if you posted here around April, I may have read your post and it may have hlped me a lot, so thank you.

At this point, I was dealing with trauma. Didn't know what normal was anymore. Believed people should be compassionate and knew it had done a lot of good during the rest of my life, but for a whole year, empathy was a foreign concept. I finally got over it last month, when I met another friend, went out to grab a pizza with her and she let me talk about this. I just said what I experienced. All she did was listen to my story and told me it wasn't normal. Said she was sorry that happened.

That's all I needed. Since then I severed the last ties, deleted all messages, fully walled them off. Except for reddit.

My ""abuser"" (not my words, hers) made a post which, if you read carefully enough, incriminates her more than me, and she really shows her true colours in the comments. That's there forever. An inaccurate story about how I was a ""nice guy"", which offers very little in terms of nice guy behaviour and more her trying to justify her behaviour. Poorly.

This should be funny, but it's not to me.

I'm fine. I'm not worried about me. 2019 has been a banger of a year for me. I've got life figured out. But I had to leave my friends, who are still stuck in their little world, firmly believing it's helping them, when I've experienced it fucking them over. And I love solving problems. I wish I could have helped them. But it wasn't going to happen. And the feeling that I know the solution but cannot help them is truly the darkest depths of my mind.

If one day something happens to one of them and weed was involved, I know what I'll be thinking. What if I succeeded in helping. Would things be different. Could I have saved them. Same thing if nothing happens and they're at rock bottom for another 20 years.

If you're looking for something to take away from this post, that's it. Weed abuse can affect your loved ones more than you realise.

If you're here because a friend smoked themselves into a fog, and you struggle to see the light yourself, came here looking for answers, well, you're not alone. I understand how you feel.

#Giving back

I want to thank this community for being so supportive. Not of me, but each other. I've been giving back by giving my perspective, and I noticed some people were really helped by that. That makes me more happy than you may realise. And it lets me know I now understand how the drug works a lot better than I did before.

While I want to keep helping this community, I also need to move on. That's why I am planning to close this account (and get rid of this last bastion of this horrible username courtesy of my 10 year old self). To enable myself to keep helping people, however, I want to give back in another way.

I have my own discord server, and I want to open it up to the public. DISCLAIMER: this server is in no way assosciated with this sub. It is purely my own little place. So please don't remove this post :) There's a small subset of my friends in there, but I feel like opening it up to people here can do a lot of good for you. I also host my own terraria server and minecraft servers, so if you're into that, feel free to join. Send me a DM if you're interested.

Finally, ask me anything below. I'll keep replying here for a little while, so that's another way I can give back. I have a different perspective on things, so maybe that helps.

Thank you for your attention. Good luck in your journeys everyone. Hope you all find what you're looking for.",5

I'm 27 and have had an on and off relationship with it since I was 13 or so. It affects my memory and cognitive function obviously during, but even a few days after. When I wake up the day after a night ""session"" I feel really dragged out and like I didn't get enough sleep. I quit for over a month and relapsed a couple of weeks ago. I feel like I've quit so many times and always picked it back up again. My sister smokes and when I'm around her I am very tempted. I think it negatively affects her quite a bit too but she's in denial. It probably doesn't help that each time I quit I give her what I have so its not around. I want to have a good relationship with her and spend time with her but the temptation is there. Tonight when I got out of my night class I drove to her house but she wasn't there. A good thing I think now, cause I probably would have smoked. I feel compelled at times and when I have depressive or anxious episodes I turn to it if it's around. 

I guess I'm just looking for good reasons not to use it. I'm sick of the back and forth and want to live a non-addictive life. I quit smoking cigarettes a few years ago, and that was such a struggle, but I'm soo glad I did. But this is a different animal, I usually end up subconsciously thinking weed is harmless, and that if I just have it every now and again it would be fine. But really I know I can't have that dynamic with it. To top it off I live in Illinois and it's going to be legalized next year. How does one stay committed? How do I deal with my temptations?

I held on to you. You were always there for me during my hardest and darkest times. I could always count on you to lift me up when things felt intolerable or when I just needed some company. You filled me with so many beautiful lies about how much better I looked and performed around you. I believed it all.

But what you didn't tell me was that you needed a part of me, every time you were there for me. As soon as I turned my back, you quietly and sneakily tore off a part  of my happiness, peace, laughter and desire to live, love and feel. You even asked me to make a sacrifice; leave behind any thing else that made me happy and forget about others around me. I devoted myself to you. I don't know if I could ever forgive you for taking so much from me and for making me feel like I need you. You took so much of me that I became invisible. I could not find myself anymore, even when I looked in mirrors. I only saw despair. 

 How could you deceive me like this? You would take me on so many magical trips ...our private get a ways...but you never quite took me back to my home. You left me in a lonely hole. A hole you dug deeper each time I saw you. I did not know your intention was to ultimately bury me in it. And so, I would continue to trust you because those trips felt so much better than being confined in that dark, troublesome hole where I only kept sinking. Where I had to sit with myself, my emotions, reality. It made me anxious. It made me want to runaway on another trip with you. I could not fathom feeling anything but the touch of you on my lips.

 Just. one.more.trip. 

but now I'm so deep in this hole that it has gotten hard to breathe. I know if I run away with you, you're going to continue digging it deeper until I can no longer see any light above me or have any air to breathe.

I have to get out of here. I can't stay here forever under your rule. But I have to get out myself and with no help from you. You lied and took more of me than I could have ever imagined. But you don't get to take any more. You have taken enough. And I need me back. I miss me. I miss living out in the real world. This hole is caving in.

 I saw the real you in your wicked smile every time you lowered me a little deeper into the hole.  You told me it was temporary but it never was. You promised the next trip would fix it all. And I believed you for years, let you control me. Although I could not see anything, hear anyone or do anything, the promise of you is what kept me alive in that darkness. I was ecstatic every time you pulled me out of there. You responded in a way no one else could. You comforted me. I simply could not get enough.

 But the rude awakening of how empty you have left me  has me furious at you and ready to climb out by my own means. I'm building myself a ladder. A step forms every time I say no to you. I'm starting to see more light. I'm starting to rebuild and recollect the pieces of me you selfishly took and carelessly scattered everywhere.

 I know it hurts you that I'm leaving, believe me, it hurts me too. So much that I almost want to wither away in this hole and forget this ladder idea. But that speck of light coming in from above this hole reminds me of the beauty of the real world. The beauty I have been deprived of for too long. Because you kept me to yourself. This beauty is what will keep me going, keep me climbing even when you try to kick me back down. I will get back up. I will never give up. So you might as well leave for good. I know I needed you before but I don't need you any longer, I am ready to live again.",215

Honestly, I don't enjoy my friendships anymore, all that. The problem is I wake up 3-6 times a night, and have a hard time going to bed in general. I work 50 hours/week in an office setting, and I just wish I was completely sober. I know that I would be smarter, less paranoid, friendlier, happier, more put together, and that's what I want. But I don't know how to sleep. I have tried Ambien, tylenol pm, trazadone, gabapentin... no effect other than feeling drugged out after I take them and after waking up... Currently I take melatonin every night, and magnesium on occasion though it messes my stomach up. And then a big hit. Its enough to guarantee that I get to sleep at a reasonable hour.... Let me tell you how bad it is though, when I wake up, not even shitty weed will put me back to sleep. Sometimes it works, and thats why I have two jars: so I can try to cut back on my thc intake by using the less potent strain to go BACK to sleep after I've already put myself to sleep with the good stuff. It works sometimes but not always....

I know my coworkers see me through this ""lens"", and so do I. I just can't stand the thought of how hard sleeping will be without pot, and how can you work without sleep? My life is pretty boring. All about maintaining. Recently had a blow out with my Dad (didn't think they hired me at all, and tried to fight me after I walked out of his office) so I am just trying to go to work, come home, sleep, and go back. Im just trying to maintain. But I am sick of myself. I hate myself for not being able to sleep. I wish pot was only recreational for me. I will never take anything else, I'm against psychoactive meds. But man I wish there was another way. 

&#x200B;

When I wake up and do anything other than smoke, I know all Im doing is wasting time because a glass of milk and supplements will never do it for me.

Quitting weed altogether may work to get rid of the need. Or it may not work at all, leaving me irritable, tired, and rigid with people.

I had violent vomiting that wouldn't stop, stomach cramps, body aches...it was bad, also was sweating like crazy and was hot n cold, which is pure hell for me. The 1st time I called emergency services and paramedics came and made sure I wasn't dying. Toughed it out that day. 
It happened again before family vacation to the ocean. Toughed it out, my poor mom trying everything to help me.
The third time I started to feel it starting, I told my mom and she took me to the emergency room/ hospital. I was eventually admitted because the vomiting wasn't stopping even after IV anti nausea medications. It was horrible. One of the meds made me crawl out of my skin even more, then they gave me benadryl which finally was able to calm me. This was like 5 hours in. 

The younger doctor I had been assigned mentioned, after testing for everything he could think of, it may be from my long term marijuana use. I thought no way but kept an open mind, I'm no doctor. I was sent home still throwing up here n there but mostly controlled, more benadryl [prescribed by doctor] and finally sleep. 
As soon as I could I looked up what the dr had said; Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome, turns out I had every symptom, it explained everything I had gone through. I thought weed was helping me but turns out it was the cause! [Look it up please I don't want to type all about CHS too rn.]

I'm grateful actually in a way, because I really wanted to quit smoking. [Weed that is, I had troubles quiting smoking before.] I wasn't able to participate in recovery based things [I'm in recovery from drug addiction, whole other subject].
I wasn't motivated anymore to do anything at all, I was gaining weight due to depression and munchies. My mental health was suffering, I'm diagnosed with sever depression and anxiety.

 Anywho I'm like a month off the weed now and my emotions have regulated themselves better, my mood has improved, I can go to recovery things and better myself now like I wanted. I can make friends that don't just smoke weed, can get quite boring compared to let's say hiking, camping, life! 😄😁🌱🌻

Catergorised into 3

My Anxiety
My Thinking Power
My Social Interactions

Anxiety

Its ruled me for 8 years or so in and off and I struggle to enjoy my own company. I'm not quite sure where this stemmed from originally though it has quite severely developed over time.

Thinking Power

I KNOW for an absolute fact that I have the capacity to be smart. I was smart at school, exams, tend to get every job I go for and so on, but I don't think AT ALL when I'm high and usually watch netflix until I pass out because I'm baked.

Social Interactions

This for me is the worst, I can have days where I'm the typical Jack-The-Lad and then there's days I make excuses to go home because im out of my comfortzone. Confrontations are kept to a minimum and moods are constantly up and down. I forget that when I smoke.

So here's to the start, day 1! May I enlighten you with my Journey and hopefully help a couple of people out.

five years ago - i moved to a legal state. and tbh haven't taken a break since. there's been the odd weekend here or there but for the most part - i've smoked at least once a day during the week - but honestly usually more. i work from home so it's easy to submit to the temptation. there was a post here last night about trauma and that's absolutely part of my story. i recovered memories of childhood abuse and got myself into trauma therapy a few years ago. again on some level - i knew marijuana was hindering my recovery. but the feelings were so intense and i'm not on any antidepressants or other medication so i've leaned heavily on marijuana to take the edge off. i told myself that it's not like alcohol - i'm still feeling the feelings, they're just dulled. but i'm not sure sure that's true anymore.

i went on a week long vacation recently and decided this was it. it was a perfect opportunity to get a lil sobriety under my belt. and it worked. i was out of my routine and came home w 8 days smoke-free. but the re-entry has been hard. there are cravings but that's not even the worst part. the worst part is facing the crippling depression that's been lying dormant underneath. it's hard to get up in the morning, hard to face the day, hard to find my motivation. i'm telling myself this is a good thing. i'm finally feeling the feelings that led to my marijuana use in the first place. it's just hard. thanks for letting me share a bit of my story.",11

The 5 or 6 times I have quit, I've stopped cold turkey and have faced bad withdrawals that don't last more than 10 days. The (2nd to) last time I stopped was some of the worst psychological feelings I had ever faced.

So fast forward to now. This past year I was doing it everyday again and kept on learning new things and trying new things and starting to get really excited for my future, but it was always met with ""well when I stop weed, I will give these things a REAL chance"" or everytime I would come out of a conversation I would think ""wow I probably would have sounded way more eloquent and way less awkward had I not been high""

A lot of the shitty feelings I faced were in my head and I knew again that I wanted to stop the past year but I was so scared of going through those withdrawals once more. I tried to convince myself that I had done it 5 or 6 times already so I can do it again. But the thought of facing those shitty feelings again kept me from quitting.

So I searched reddit and researched to see if there had been people that successfully weaned off. I found that most people do NOT recommend it and have little success in doing so.

So for anyone who can relate to me, I'll share how I was able to successfully wean myself off of weed. Idk if this is even allowed in this subreddit, let me know.

It's kinda like the ""smoke the rest of what you have and then don't buy more"" concept except more disciplined. Because everyone including myself thinks like that and as soon as you are running low or out, you just buy more.

So what worked for me was giving myself 2-4 weeks to consume the rest of what I had. I guess it will depend on your tolerance and how much you have left, etc. Idk what to say here, maybe get rid of all of it except for a few weeks worth. 

So for me it was a combination of a few things (and this won't work for everyone but it worked for me). 

1) The easiest way to look at it at first is taking the first hit of the day as late as you possibly can. This really is the key.

Maybe you can get it down to just 1 hit before bed and that's pretty good.

2) If you can, change your environment. I ended up moving back to college town after summer, into a new house with new people. Obviously not everyone can just plan on doing a change like that. But I think being slightly out of my comfort zone and staying busy throughout the day is very important. Sitting around in your room with nothing to do always made me wanna toke.

3) This one will be controversial for sure. After I had completely ran out of what I had, I didn't have an urge to get more or smoke more at all. And what really helped me was NOT counting the days of being sober.

A lot of the issues I had were psychological and I found that keeping close track everyday just kept me thinking about it and I was in my head. When I stopped keeping track, a couple weeks would go by and I thought ""damn I haven't really thought about it at all in 2 weeks. Amazing""

So that's pretty much it. This is just my personal experience with it, there's a lot of people that won't find this helpful. Know yourself.

Just to briefly recap or give an example of what I did.

Day 1: first hit of the day 4pm
Day 2: first hit of the day 4:30pm
Day 3: first hit of the day 6pm
And so on.. 

I think some people will find it surprisingly easy to do this. Don't smoke earlier than you did the previous day!! However, if you do, don't beat yourself up and just keep going. I messed up a couple times and smoked earlier than previous days. It's ok just get back on track. 

By the time I was running low, I barely had an urge to smoke anymore. And I started to lose myself in everyday activities, especially cooking! 

So many things i wanted to do and try and I thought ""yeah I'll do this when I'm not high"" and now finally I'm doing them. 

I didn't feel any withdrawals when I had completely quit. And this was something I was so afraid of! 

I think that's it. I haven't seen too many people talk about weaning off so hopefully this is insightful. I don't know better than anyone else, just sharing my experience. Feel free to ask questions.

I immediately miss being clear headed, not anxious and getting things done/having more time in my day. This morning my room was messy again & filled with dirty dishes. I hate that shit.

He got sober 4 years ago. I was not even a drinker until college (not a very cool high schooler), didn’t start smoking pot at all until after college. I smoked casually, would quit for work tests etc, but my use became more and more aggressive, to the point where most recently I was taking puffs without even quite realizing whether I was smoking my juul or pot. 

I have lurked for a bit but wasn’t ready to quit pot until I had to take a medical leave from work for an unrelated reason starting a week ago. Without the structure and responsibility of work to keep me from smoking, I found myself stoned all day; I kept telling myself I was stressed and I needed it. But then I thought about how work is my main stressor and I’ve been relieved of that worry. So it quickly became clear that something else (habit, other stressors that I’m not addressing, mood, loneliness, etc) was driving my use, which made me feel icky. 

I quit Friday morning, and I’ve been able to stick to it with surprisingly few cravings. One thing I will mention is that I have been taking NAC (n-acetylcysteine), 600mg extended release (made by Jarrow) daily, which was suggested by a psychiatrist to assist with urges to smoke (not tons of great research, but some mediocre data to support this). 

The biggest problem I’m having is that as soon as I stopped smoking my feelings flooded back, and all at once. As it turns out, I’m depressed! Very, very depressed!! And the weed was an easy and convenient, albeit expensive, way to hold those feelings at a distance — they were behind a literal smoke screen. I have a great therapist who is helping me with this. 

Saturday night into Sunday I had a dream that I took a long shower in my childhood home (which my parents recently sold). When I got out of the shower the water was pouring over the railing from the second floor into the first floor of the house, ruining everything. I apologized to my mom, who had been waiting for me to get out of the shower to tell me (🙄), and she said, “it’ll be fine. The last time this happened it was horrible, but we’ve been through it before, and we’ll get through this.” I take this as my worry about the damage addiction has done to my family and my fear of admitting that I’m sick because of the burden it imposes on other people. 

I am trying to remember how much better my brother’s life got after he got sober, how much better all of our lives got. I deserve to feel better about myself, and my family and friends deserve to have me mentally present when I am with them, even if my feelings can be hard to bear. 

Last night I dreamt that I smoked and I was SO disappointed in myself for abandoning these days I have been sober — so I’m hoping to remember that feeling to help keep me away from relapsing. 

Thank you for reading and for mutual support!! It’s gotten me this far... here’s to the rest.",8

I find myself sleeping most of the day depressed or finding most things uninteresting. As soon as I get high, everything's great and enjoyable, but that feeling subtly fades to being moderately happy at best(which is still better than feeling completely depressed and uninterested in anything.) I'm telling myself that weed is harmless to my health and if anything there's known benefits if I just do it a little -- yet at the same time I'll argue in my head that it also completely unmotivates me to do anything with my life, and that I'll never be happy without smoking if I don't fight it now. I'm also telling myself that it should be fine to just relax at the end of a day with a nice smoke, but I also know how easily that leads to me smoking throughout the day, especially if I have nothing to do.

&#x200B;

This is one of the biggest reason I've went cold turkey and just stopped completely. If I knew I was capable of just smoking once to a couple times a week (not throughout the day) I'd be ok, but I know that as soon as the high fades, things will suck and I'll just want to get high again. It also makes me afraid that even IF I'm able to be happy in life without being high, that nothing will ever give that immediate rush of euphoria that smoking a bowl provides, and that I'd forever be tempted the rest of my life and eventually giving in. I guess this post is sort of a rant and hopefully to seek reasons as to why I shouldn't smoke, and why in the end it would be so much better to just quit.",5

I know it’s just a mood imbalances trying to balance out because I’ve made it long enough without weed before to the point where my mood was so consistent and instead of feeling cocky or sad, I just felt content for weeks before I relapsed.

The biggest problem I'm  having is I think I'm using food to replace cannabis.  I'm constantly hungry now, always looking to consume something, trying to fill a void. I quit cigarettes 2 years ago, and I purposely do not drink as I come from a long line of alcoholics, so weed is my last vice, and I'm really struggling giving it up.

I do not want to replace my last addiction with another one. Especially food because you cant just cold turkey on food. I'm concerned because from what I've seen here, many of you have actually LOST your appetite, but I'm the exact opposite. 

I guess I'm just looking for a bit of positive vibes to help me as I figure out how to cope in a healthy way.",3

Getting kind words and support has gone a long way both mentally and emotionally. It’s really cool being a part of something with people who genuinely want others to succeed, it’s a beautiful thing.
I’m on day 8 and something feels really different this time around. I’ve tried quitting many times and have gotten to maybe 45 days before I slip up, but I feel really prepared this time. In the past I still clung on to boredom and nothingness without being too proactive to change it. So I was doing the same things I would do high, while sober, instead of taking advantage of the newfound energy and interest in things I would have.
I’ve been getting outside every day (I live in Arizona so it’s just starting to cool down), walking my dog, getting back into weight lifting, watching more interesting things like documentaries vs mindless shit. I started learning Japanese 2 days ago (something I’ve always wanted to do), which if I smoke I know will completely blow any progress I make with that. I also am in the middle of a good book and a good game which has been convenient timing!
Mentally and emotionally, I’ve felt a tremendous difference. My moods have leveled out and it’s been easier to work through any negative emotions as they come up. I was starting to have panic attacks a few times a month, and I think the highs and lows of pot didn’t help on a long term basis (even though when I did have anxiety it was sometimes a bandaid). My memory is better. I’m not blanking out through parts of conversations with people which in turn, also helps my anxiety.
Anyways, things are good. I like writing posts here and there to look back on and keep myself accountable.

I want to take the next step in life, and I know I can’t do it while smoking pot. Part of me wants to erase that sentence and try to convince you all to validate my addiction and blame the system we were born into, but if I am ready to move on in my life, I need to be honest with myself. Marijuana is not a bad drug, it has helped millions of people in this world, but it is holding me back from becoming a more successful person. 

19 hours though. I was counting each minute. Standing in my kitchen for 45 minutes staring around, unable to make up my mind on where to start my day, thoughts and ideas clogging up my mind to the point that all I could do was stand and stare. This is going to suck. I don’t want to stop smoking weed. I love it. It slows my head down. I can think for two minutes. I’m not as impulsive. I’m not as anxious. I’m not so cold hearted. But I’m not sober. I haven’t gone a day in years without smoking. I’m scared. It has woven itself throughout my body and soul. It has been the one constant in my life for the last decade and now I need to say goodbye? What am I going to numb myself from the world with? Why am I so afraid?

I have created the habit of including weed in almost every facet of my life. I’ve spent thousands of dollars on much more addictive substances, but I did not feel anywhere near the way I do now when I quit those. I need help. Maybe I just need to type this out once in awhile. I have no self control. 


I found this subreddit years ago and thought nothing of it until today after that 19 hours was up and I smoked some pot. I don’t feel like crap anymore, and I actually have the urge to eat some food. I’m hoping that tomorrow when I am busy with work, that I will have started my day off without smoking and it won’t be as hard here in my apartment. It was just so hard to make the choice to step outside. 


I’m sorry for typing all of this out so erratically, this was absolute word vomit. I haven’t gotten to read much here yet, but if anyone could shoot me some pointers on how to handle the anxiety and appetite problems that come with the abstinence I would appreciate it. 


I guess we all have to start somewhere, I apologize if I am being dramatic, I just feel like shit and want to change.",9
2019-10-14 18:40:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dhyfma/trauma_is_the_real_gateway/,Trauma is the real gateway,"Things like cannabis, caffeine and alcohol are not the gateways. Things like molestation, childhood abuse, neglect and TRAUMA are the real gateways. These things manifest into addiction, hyper sexuality, violent tendencies, self harm etc. All of these things are the SYMPTOMS not the cause of a much larger issue. All of these manifestations stem from some sort of emotional trauma or childhood abuse. This is why traditional 30 day rehabs and medications don't typically work. We need to get to the root cause of the trauma that leads so many to look outside of themselves for relief from SELF.

Addiction is manifested in any behavior that brings temporary relief or pleasure yet causes negative consequences. This behavior is then difficulty to give up. We need to realize that addiction is not a CHOICE, addiction is not an inherited disease. Addiction is a physiological and psychological response to a painful life experience. 

I think so many can agree, if able to put their egos aside, that many people have dealt with some sort of traumatic experience. Maybe not as extreme as something like sexual assault, but maybe growing up in a toxic household around parents who yelled and were always stressed or even depressed. Trauma doesnt have to be so significant it can be anything that our bodies/minds (especially when children) cannot comprehend or process. These past experiences subconsciously manifest in creating barriers or walls to protect ourselves. When we become adults they really reek havoc and manifest in all types of issues as noted above. I'm sure many of us can also agree we have at one time or another had some sort of addiction behavior whether it be, overworking, shopping, unhealthy/over eating, gambling, sex, drama, codependent relationships, etc.. We need to come together and stop judging one another. We need to stop bandaging our issues and get to the root cause, the root trauma and reach out for help when needed. This is a sign of strength not weakness. Trauma can also store in our physical bodies which can also manifest into sickness and disease, making us more at risk for cancers and things like autoimmune disease.

TRAUMA is the real gateway.",363

Today’s day 24 no weed and I’m feeling pretty down this morning. Kind of missing the relationship that I left about three days ago, but I know it’s for the best and these feelings will pass. I also have this reaccuring stress dream that I seem to have once or twice a month and I had a version of it last night. 

I’ve had stomach issues for years and in early 2018 I had a CT scan, colonoscopy, and endoscopy all of which came back normal. I’ve been working on my diet over the past year and have read tons of books on the mind body connection, stress, etc and how that stuff can effect the stomach. But HOLY SHIT I’m frustrated with having the stomach tension and it scares me sometimes. The tension and pain never gets too bad it’s more just discomfort and causes me stress. Part of me wants to get another CT scan but it’s like fuck I’m just paranoid I had one last year and it was all good. Plus all the radiation and shit can’t be good for my body. I’ve been to the doctor so many times about this stuff I don’t think more tests are the answer.
I’m also thinking this stomach stuff could be weed related. Has anyone here had stomach issues that was a heavy smoker and then had there symptoms get better after quitting? If so how long did it take?

I have the urge to smoke today but I’m not going to. Smoking has been a way for me to not think about my physical or mental health but it doesn’t actually solve anything . Plus like I said I think there’s a chance it could be causing my stomach issues. Argh I just want to get out of my head though. But I know the only way out of these stresses is through, not to run from them. A strong part of me things my stomach stuff could be emotional too and I use weed to suppress my emotions. 

Ok I’m going to go ride my bike or something. Thanks for reading. Gonna stay strong today!

It all ended up with a thought ""I will only smoke for this one day and then quit again"". Fast forward two months I'm smoking basically 24/7.

On saturday night I lost my bag and how that affected me made me realize this just isn't right. I had a really nice moment with my best friend but once I realized I'm out of weed I just felt so stressed and bad. My reaction made me so sad. How can a thing that's actually very destructuring for my life controll my emotions and feeling so much.

So last night I smoked weed and drank beer. I was heading to bed and said a short prayer about how I'd really like to get rid of this addiction. I got strange feeling that I should throw away the rest of the weed now. I tried to resist it first but more I thought about it more I realized it's the right thing to do. After at least minute standing next to my trash can I was able to do it. Felt relieved but also quite sad at the same time.

Today has been super foggy and I'm also in a flu so I can't go to excercise which makes things a bit more harder. Half an hour ago my brains started suggesting me if there would be some weed in the trash I could still smoke. First I laughed about it but after a while I found myself digging the trash can. And indeed there was one small bud which seemed clean. I was almost on a path to smoke it but just made a decision to take the trash out of my house immediatelly. Now I'm feeling kind of sad and depressed but I know this feeling will go away eventually.

It's very very hard for me to imagine staying away from weed for the rest of my life, or even this week. I've tried quitting soooooo many times. I've been without it longest 1 year and few shorter stints but usually I fail during the first week. I'm kind of hopeless as I know how easily I can convince myself that relapse is my only option. There's no strength in me to do this alone but with this community and God's mercy I may be able to stay away from weed one day at a time.

Today is first day on that path. Thanks for reading this far!",77

For me it’s Muay Thai, and believe me it works haha. Anyway, this post is just to say a few things:

Keep going, don’t look back cos failure is not an option!!
Fight your way through it, it gets easier after the second week!
Love who you are, you are stronger than you know.
Embrace the future and let go of the past.
And finally stay away from certain triggers for the first weeks cos they will drag you back (this includes friends who smoke I’m afraid guys!) 

Good luck to you all! Strength is the power of the mind!",1

Every time I’ve relapsed, I’ve ended up in the same place. Stuck. Trapped. Lots of ideas, very little action. Disconnected. Out of shape. Unemployed. Lonely.

So much struggle, every day. So much confusion, forgetfulness, exhaustion. The mess. The broken promises. The unreliability. The lost potential.

My brain is damaged, my vision is damaged (can’t see in the dark) my lungs are damaged, my retirement is nonexistent.

This could be your future. I hope it isn’t.

After Day 7 I was starting to feel better but a few days ago my physical symptoms came back with a vengeance. Lack of appetite is a big one, I have to force feed myself and even eating sweet stuff feels like a chore. I'm basically surviving on cereal bars and bags of peanuts and I'm struggling to even get more than 1400 calories in me each day. I've dropped from 150lbs down to 137lbs and people are starting to ask questions about the sudden loss in weight.

What is most annoying though is the crazy dreams that wake me up at around 4am - 5am every night and having to then get up, wipe the sweat off myself with a towel then change T shirts and try to get another couple of hours sleep. I've tried covering myself in anti perspirant, I've tried Talcum Powder, I've tried just going to bed without anything on and a thinner blanket yet the amount of sweat is the same.

I'm sick of all this, the previous 2 times I quit I was over all this crap by now. This time round everything is way more intense and drawn out. What makes things worse is my BO reeks of Weed, so much so that even with deodorant and aftershave on I still get looks and comments about the smell.

I'm not gonna give up, I just needed to vent about this. I feel so tired, weak and sweaty all the time and it's really getting me down.",4

(Well I did wake up feeling good , much better after a long night of being high). But it’s only day 2.....

I was feeling pretty good except for around 4/5 o clock. And then I started thinking about x y z. I started to feel anxiety, which I have been dealing with pretty much my entire life. And there was nothing there for me to take a hit of (if you didn’t read my previous post I threw out all my stash yesterday) . I’m not gonna lie. I went down to the big trash bin thing today twice, (I live in a apartment building with maybe 20-30 apartments) and looked in looking for my fucking trash of where I threw out my stuff. That’s how desperate I was. I didn’t see my trash but I was pretty sure it was in there (there wasn’t too much). The stupid thing is I don’t feel ashamed writing this even though I feel like I should be? Digging through the trash? Am I willing to dig through a dirty trash bin with god knows what in it for a high? Something tells me this is a little bit messed up. 

Anyways long story short I was like nope, it’s gone and I’m going to be sober . This was maybe 1-2 hours ago. I have to admit I am still craving but not as bad. I am starting to realize how addicted I am (somehow I feel uneasy using that word?) because if I had some right here right now I wouldn’t be able to stop myself. I have no willpower. And quitting is not about getting more willpower. For me at least it’s about making myself in a situation where the access to it is more difficult (at least for now) .

Would not recommend lol.,"Typical 21-year old struggling with depression/anxiety. I'd previously been on medication but it didn't work out. Because of the success stories, I began smoking weed in March. My usage rose to everyday dependence.

It numbed my anxiety. I went from sadness to blandness, which was good enough for me. I hated sobriety because my emotional spectrum — joy, passion, fear, anxiety — would slam me in the chest. I'd sometimes wake up sober with tears in my eyes. 

I also started emotional eating again. My uni marks were dropping due to late submissions. I could not bear to deal with reality.

A few weeks ago, I took MDMA with close friends. They were laughing and hugging each other. However, I felt a yawning black hole in my brain. I could not connect with anyone else. I was a meat ghost. My serotonin was GONE. That's when I realised my brain chemistry was fked up. 

I have now flushed the weed. I am using my worm farm to help me heal. I'm also seeing a therapist on Wednesday so I can stop running from my depression/anxiety/other underlying issues.

2019-10-13 20:35:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dhj1m3/a_true_story_from_stoner_to_surgeon/,A True Story: From Stoner to Surgeon,"I was standing at the edge of my apartment building 9 stories up, stood on a stool, angry, tears rolling down my face, about to jump out of the window on an impulse of anger while my younger brother watched in shock. It was a cry for help. My senses quickly overtook me and I stepped back down.

It was the summer of 2013, I was in my early 20s, lost and confused. I was DJ’ing at clubs, making electronic music, and smoking weed out of bongs every single day, multiple times a day. I was also studying science at the university but I was at the brink of failure. It was my 6th year of university. Took 2 extra years. I barely studied. I just wanted to make music, party, and smoke weed all day with my friends. I kept trying to quit but I just couldn’t do it. I would always feel the urge to just take another hit again and again. This was my vicious cycle. After that terrible day, I called my parents and told them I needed help. My parents have always been good people but they didn’t know how lost I was. I didn’t really let them know. I was good at hiding things. At around this time, they had been having some Theravada Buddhist Monks visiting our house to teach Dhamma. I had met one a few months back. His name was Tam Dao. Which means The Way of the Mind. He was 21 at the time. Extremely tall, 6’5”, skinny, pale, blue eyes, and caucasian. It was so rare. I have never met a caucasian Buddhist monk before. I wondered what brought him on this path. I got to know him. We immediately clicked. He’s now one of my best friends. He had this calm serenity about him. So attentive, thoughtful, and careful with his words. Fast forward to the moment I almost jumped off the balcony. His master was Thay Tam Hanh. Master Tam Hanh was a wise sage, about 60 years old, and many people in the community say that he has supra-normal powers from his deep meditation, but he would always deny it. I called my parents and told them I wanted to move to the monastery. I didn’t know what else to do. But I needed help. Something about the Buddhist Monks and their energy drew me towards them.

It was October 2014, I had hit rock bottom that summer. I decided to contact Tam Dao, and his master Tam Hanh to become a Samanera at their temple up in the mountains of Big Bear, California. I officially moved to the monastery and ordained as a Samanera, which is a temporary monk. I shaved my head, and put on the ochre robes during a ceremony and made my vows to hold the 5 precepts: Not to kill, not to take what is not given, not to deceive, not to perform sexual misconducts, and not to take any intoxicants. I haven’t told you this, but when I came to university, I was interested in science, and wanted to become a doctor, but the distractions of girls, youth, partying, and my background in music led me away from my original goal. Anyways, back to the story. I was sick. The outer third of my eyebrow hairs were missing, I had acne, I was so skinny from barely eating, there was eczema all over my body, and I was having these muscle twitches all day. The first few nights without marijuana were rough. I had the most vivid dreams. It was like all the 6 years of smoking, going to bed high, had stopped all my dreams and they all came flooding back. The monks set a schedule. The day started at 5am. We started with tea, followed by meditation. After that we would prepare breakfast. We would then do chores around the monastery like cleaning the Buddha statues, and sweeping the floors. We would eat lunch. We would learn about the Dhamma. We would meditate. And we would sleep early. Fast forward 2 weeks. The cravings started to subside a little. I found out that I got a conditional acceptance to a post bacc program and if I did well on all the pre-requisite courses that I would be accepted to medical school. I came back home. I had felt some of the benefits of quitting smoking. When I returned home, I officially moved out of my apartment and moved in back to my childhood home with my parents. But I felt like my time at the monastery was cut short. This time, I decided to become a monk for 1 month on a deep meditation retreat. It changed my life forever. Thay Tam Hanh was always so happy and cheerful, but extremely wise, with eyes that could pierce your soul. He always knew the right things to say to help you. Being around them, there was this energy that was transformative. It was like their wave length frequencies were on another level, and I feel like that helped “tune” my energy out of the previous funk that I was in. I learned about the 4 Noble Truths, the Noble 8 Fold Path, and the 10 Perfections. I learned how to meditate. I learned how to dispel superstitions and delusions. I learned about discipline. Thay (which means master) would tell me my nightly mantra to wish to myself each night. It was to say, “may I be happy, may I be well.” It seems so simple, but the first step is to love yourself. And I did not love myself. As I meditated more, I realized what the Buddha meant about how your actions follow you like a shadow. Do bad things, and bad results will follow like a shadow. Do good things, and happiness will follow like a shadow. This was my great epiphany. During the past, I would do things that would lead to my suffering without even realizing it. Things that would make me short term happy but ultimately would lead me nowhere towards my goals. At the end of that month, the change was gradual, but looking back, it changed my life. I was a different person, but I didn’t even realize it at the time. I had a different mentality. I hadn’t smoked weed for 2 months, it was the first time I had ever stopped for that long since I was 18. It was like I got woken up from a terrible dream. I then went to medical school with that same mentality. These were the 3 principles that changed my life:

1. Good cause bears good fruit, but you have to put in the work for the results to bloom. It’s like watering a plant, The plant won’t grow without any nurturing. The same goes for your goals and dreams.
2. Bad deeds, lead to suffering. Whether it is smoking weed, smoking cigarettes, killing, stealing, lying, cheating, even if they are temporarily gratifying, these will all eventually lead to the end outcome of suffering. I learned to avoid these once I saw things through the lens of Kamma.
3. Love yourself, wish yourself well, if you don’t love yourself, then who else will? If you don’t stand up for yourself, then who will? Once you start to wish yourself well and truly mean it, this is the foundation for confidence

I kept these stickies on my laptop:

*“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure. “ - Colin Powell*

*and*

*“Success depends upon previous preparation, and without such preparation there is sure to be failure.” - Confucius*

Long story short, I excelled medical school. I finished at the top of my class graduating with highest honors (summa cum laude). Looking back, it’s a miracle. I took the medical board exams (USMLE Step 1, 2CK, and 3) and finished in the 90th-95th percentile in the world. By the Buddha’s teachings, with each success, I transferred those merits to the Triple Gem, and I extinguished any ego that should arise from those results. I wanted to keep improving. I quietly kept my successes to myself. Those board scores allowed me to secure a spot in a competitive surgical residency spot. My face is now clear, my eyebrows grew back, my eczema is gone, and the muscle twitching has gone. I look younger than I ever did before. Now I get to help people everyday as a doctor. I apply those same fundamental principles today. Looking back 5 years ago, if you were to see me then and now, you wouldn’t believe it. During medical school, one time after an exam, I remember I smoked weed with my peers to celebrate, but this time it was so different. I didn’t feel good at all. I felt overwhelmed. I just remember thinking that I wish I was sober and clear headed, and what a delight it would be to be clear. I just didn’t like it anymore. Because of that moment, I am just not interested in doing those things anymore. I can’t describe it, but in comparison, it’s a much better feeling dwelling in the state of mind where you feel pure and clean. You are more care free when you are without intoxicants. Less paranoid. I feel clear headed, bright minded, light weight, confident, healthy feeling, and all the other associated benefits with it. It leads into a lifestyle where I just want to be healthy, drink plenty of water, eat healthy, get plenty of rest, keep my mind sharp, and mingle around with people. But I also enjoy dwelling in solitude from time to time to regather my energy.

If you feel like you are stuck and there is no way out, if you feel hopeless, trapped in the vicious cycle, just remember my story. If I can do it, you can definitely do it too. Life is impermanent, including suffering. There is a bright future for you. You just need to apply the principles of the Buddha’s teaching into your life. Without positive action, there are no good results. Wish yourself well. Delight in the purity of living a healthy lifestyle. Stay away from intoxicants that can control your mind and put you in a negative frequency. As your mind and body adjusts, it leads to a state of equilibrium that brings out tranquility and happiness. And as you start to see the relationships around you blossoming, and those around you becoming happier, and achieving success in your goals because you are more mentally and physically in tune to accomplish these things, the good kammas start to multiply.

May you be happy and well.

There is so much more I want to say, but that would take an entire novel to tell you about the stories and unusual things that happened when living in the temple in the mountains. I am indebted and so grateful for everything they did for me. I would not be here today if it was not for them. They are always open and welcoming their doors to those who wish to seek change in their life for the better. You can private message me to get into contact with them. Tell them that the Doctor Monk sent them.

Sincerely,

Magga Metta, MD

**TL;DR:** I was smoking bongs multiple times a day for 6 years. Couldn’t quit. Rock bottom almost jumped out of my apartment window. Met 2 Buddhist monks who changed my life. Learned how to apply the Buddhist teachings of the 4 Noble Truths, 8 Fold Path, and 10 Perfections. Ended up going to medical school and graduating at the top of my class. Now a surgical resident at a competitive program and life is good.

[Day 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/db0ah6/stopped_vaping_carts_daily_now_on_day_3_of/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

Hello everyone. I just wanted to say a few words on my progress: 17 days in, and I feel MUCH better both physically & mentally. I want to share some of the things I did and hopefully it will resonate with some of you. I will divide it into two sections: physical & mental. 

I know it's quite the long read, and I don't blame you for not being into it. I **bolded** the parts that I felt were most important. For those that do read it, I hope it helps you.

**Physical:**

* Stomach: The stomach issues I experienced have subsided and my appetite is back. In the first week or so, I had serious loss of  appetite, and felt like when I did eat that I would get indigestion from everything. What helped me out the most was taking pepto bismol for the immediate symptoms, and switching to a healthier diet free of high-sodium foods. I also added pro-biotic foods like Kefir & Activia yogurt based on /u/comfortfood99 's recommendation and they definitely helped my stomach feel better. I've also been drinking chamomile tea almost daily, and feel like it helps calm my nerves & stomach as well.

* Sleep: As far as sleep goes, I'm still having pretty vivid dreams, but I'm getting more and more used to them so they aren't throwing off my sleep as much as before. None of them have been particularly unpleasant, so it's really just a matter of getting used to having them again which isn't so bad.

* Cravings:  I personally haven't had many strong ones after the first week or so. For the most part, this is because I know that if I blaze again, I doubt that I will enjoy it. At best, I will be high for a time, and will just feel bad about giving up & at worst I will have another terrible experience like I had which made me realize I should quit in the first place.

In general, I started working out more, taking daily walks outside, and have been hitting the Sauna as much as I can (this is more of an Eastern European thing, but I recommend it because it feels amazing). Treat your body well and you'll ultimately feel better physically.

**Mental:**

As far as my mental health, I have gained a lot of progress at keeping myself from spiraling into dark existential thoughts & pointlessly ruminating on things I can't answer or control. The main tools I used are reading about philosophy (Stoicism & a bit of Zen Buddhism in particular), meditation, being active, socializing with others as much as possible, and speaking my worries & anxious thoughts out loud to my friends. One of the big things was realizing that **because I've been blazing since high-school, I had never really developed any internal coping mechanisms for dealing with hardships in life.** If I felt bad, anxious, bored, etc, I could blaze or vape and be fine. This worked for me for over 7 years, until it finally didn't about 3 weeks ago. Once that happened, I realized that I lacked the mental tools to be able to be the strongest version of myself, and that forced me to get to re-building.

* Dealing with anxiety/existential thoughts: This may not be for everyone, but what really helped me out was reading a book about the Stoic philosophy called [A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic-ebook/dp/B0040JHNQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8). The Stoics were a branch of philosophy that essentially tried to create a way of living that would lead to the ultimate goal of mental tranquility, which I'm sure would appeal to many of you like it did to me. While not everything they say should be taken as gospel, I found a lot of wisdom in the way they looked at life. Particularly, I liked how they used psychological tricks like Negative Visualization, purposefully denying themselves pleasures sometimes, mentally categorizing problems into things they can & can't control, etc. I've been trying to adopt parts of it into my daily life, which is easier said than done, but it feels nice to have a goal for strengthening your own mind. **It feels like I'm slowly creating a filter in my own my own mind to prevent negative thoughts from getting in.**

* Meditation: The other thing I've been doing to strengthen my ability to deal with my own thoughts is Meditation. It has really helped me to be able to have a period of time in my day where I can just focus on my breathing, let my thoughts wander without judgement, and gain some literal space in my mind. [Also, for those of you like me that are skeptical of anecdotal evidence & want some empirical proof of the benefits of meditiation, check out this article on a Harvard Medical School study done by a neuroscientist on the effects of meditation on the brain] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/05/26/harvard-neuroscientist-meditation-not-only-reduces-stress-it-literally-changes-your-brain/).

I started out using the headspace app for guided meditation, which is a fantastic app for beginners: You can even select time-periods of 3 minutes at time to get started which was super helpful for me. **I've gotten much better at simply dismissing the thoughts that get in despite my best efforts and simply live in the moment**, and feel like it would definitely help people who are struggling with the feelings of anxiety & depression that withdrawals are giving them (though if you have non-weed related disorders I **strongly** suggest you talk to a professional regardless*)

* Socializing & Putting your bad thoughts into words: I can't stress enough how much simply talking to my dad, or my friends has helped me through this part of my life. Being around people that love you helps so much, and having people you respect & value tell you that things will get better is. Plus, **sometimes putting your anxious thoughts into words instead of endlessly spiraling into pointless rumination can help a lot.** It certainly did for me. That being said, I know some of you may not be as fortunate to have understanding/living parents, or a supportive group of friends. Trying to tackle this alone can be very difficult, so I sincerely hope you utilize either r/leaves or some sort of community like MA. Also, it goes without saying that you can PM at any time.

**TL;DR: Some final thoughts**:

When I was at my lowest point in withdrawal, I kept thinking about how much **I wanted to go back to the way I was before I smoked weed.** The problem with that idea though is that the old me wouldn't be able to learn from my mistakes, and would likely come back to this exact same point. What helped me the most was the realization that my goal shouldn't be **going back to the old me, but rather going forward to the new me.** You can't undo the years of smoking that you've done, but you sure as hell can learn from them going forward. Instead of trying to return to how you were, build yourself into someone new. For me that, that came in the form of reading philosophy & meditation, starting to work out again, and finding appreciation for life in every possible way I can. For you, it might be different, but it will still be fucking worth it in the end.",11

Hi guys, i'm sharing with you because I really don't have anywhere else to go..  i'm 23 and have been smoking daily for the past 5 years or so. Started smoking when I was 14. Recently I have been thinking a lot of how much better my life could have been if I was not such a heavy smoker. I smoke so much that now I can't study without smoking up a little before.

Little background:  I'm a law student who's in his masters degree, and my university path has been quite fine, HOWEVER i am certain that I am way more intelligent than my current state and i'm starting to realise that smoking up all these years has been keeping me from reaching my real heights

Socially I'm becoming more aware that smoking all these years has fucked me up socially.. I have my friends (90% of whom are smokers and my closest friends are heavy smokers too) but i'm finding it really hard socially with other people, quite frankly i'm always overwhelmed when with people.Needless to take about the usual shit that comes with smoking : procrastination, delusion that I can't function without smoking, anxiety, memory loss, less concentrated, days gone by with absolutely nothing done

I've tried quitting many times.. A week ago I woke up without anything on me and was really motivated, decided that that day was a new beginning. Was the WORST day of my life. All those feelings, thoughts and anxiety that smoking has been putting back all those years comes crawling back. I can feel the withdrawal symptoms from the first day : sleeplessness, worst anxiety ever, bursting thoughts through my brain, got nothing done all day because I just sat there thinking about wanting to smoke. Was a nightmare getting to sleep too.Woke up the next day and first thing I did was called my dealer

These days i'm feeling really shit, I really want to quit but I feel that i'm stuck in this cycle that will never end. I always have these thoughts that I love smoking, that it makes me enjoy more the things I love like music, that a night smoking up with friends is really fun,

So I think these feelings are always holding me back from quitting and everytime I try the withdrawal effects drive me crazy that I just smoke

Does anyone have any advice for me???",3

Last night was my first night not using weed to fall asleep. I somehow slept for 10 hours but none of it was restful. 


Last night I dreamt my family needed me. I dreamt I was keeping them safe in a basement during an apocalypse. I took on the responsibility of going out and getting supplies and information. It was monstrous and violent outside, and I was fighting and killing for them. 


This hit hard because my family doesn’t really need me. We only see each other on holidays.






I realize I’ve been numbing myself to protect myself from the feelings of being unneeded for the past couple years. I moved to be closer to them a few years ago because they asked me to.


All last winter, my siblings would go skiing together close to where I live, but never once told me to join, or even that they were going to be nearby. I imagine they know I saw their stories on instagram. I would see them laughing together on the slopes and instantly break down. My next response was to go smoke a joint, and try not to think about them. I had to stop watching their stories on instagram to avoid feeling painfully left out. 


Next, my weed use got worse. I started justifying being a hermit most evenings. I have a couple wonderful close friends, but all I’ve ever wanted was to feel needed by my family. I’m ADHD and have a typical middle child inferiority complex, but instead of numbing it all… I’m feeling it all.


I know I can’t keep using weed to quiet these thoughts and feelings. I also know better than to bring up these feelings of rejection and inadequacy because I still love seeing them on holidays, and don’t want a bad vibe in the air when I finally get to see them. I feel like I have to be an adult, and suck it up.

I don't wanna be someone who can only handle *some* emotions",5

2019-10-13 16:08:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dhfs7r/its_worth_it/,It’s worth it.,"I spent 10 months of relapsing over and over until this May. There are two reasons why I got the strength to stop. The big one, this subreddit. All of the success and motivational posts here which is why I am writing mine. The second reason, it got to the point where I lost touch with reality, lost myself in the rabbit hole. I believe it would be described as cannabis induced psychosis. That was the siren that pushed me over the edge and made me stop completely. I wish I was smart and strong enough to stop earlier as today my life is 20 times better, no brain fog, I’m charismatic with my friends and the girls again, I can focus, and I’m not constantly rushing conspiracies through my head and being confused. No more night sweats and withdrawals. More money in my wallet. I feel like the guy I used to be before I started smoking. It may seem like you fucked yourself up for good but your brain is pliable.  Makes me wonder why I even smoked in the first place. I can’t remember half of the hell that withdrawals are at this point and I wish I could’ve listed everything but I assure you no matter how hard you are struggling in your journey. Gather the strength because you aren’t any different than anyone else, you aren’t weak. Be the best you can be go workout and focus on other things, boredom is a quick route for relapse. Force yourself to get out of the loop.

One of the many many many times I tried and failed to quit. It was a good reminder of how far I've come in the past 4.5 months. It's alot of rambling of a scared guy in his 20's trying to fix his life by himself, but there's a couple things that stand out: 

>Ive refused to see what I've become. I've looked aside as i've changed everyday.

Change happens slowly. You don't become an addict overnight. It's such a slow decent you don't see it happen. I didn't have a problem with weed for close to a decade, but at some point it went from being a fun thing I did on the weekend to an obsession. And on the flipside, you don't change your life for the better in a single day. It takes time and a whole lot of effort.

> Get up everyday, because its a new day. Things to be done. Steps forward to be had. All that you just read and wrote, means nothing if you don't make a change. So step off. March 18, 2015 is a new day. 

It took me 4 and a half years to truly act on this idea. Any day can be the day that you start to change your life. Its a lot of steps to make sweeping change, but you have to have the strength to take the first one. And sometimes you have to take that first step over and over again before you can make the second step. 

My life is infinitely better than it was 4.5 years ago or 4.5 months ago. For me, there's no going back now.",4
2019-10-13 13:32:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dhdmhd/19_days_weed_free/,19 days weed free.,"I’ve relapsed so many times since trying to quit since March. I’ve visited r/petioles a zillion times just to try and convince myself that I could moderate my usage. I think if we’re on here, we obviously can’t and that’s okay. I think I’ve relapsed so many times that I don’t even have cravings anymore. I know what weed does to me and I know it’s no longer beneficial to my growth. Once you come to that realization, shit will get so much easier. I don’t even think about it anymore. If I feel depressed, it’s okay. I feel like a lot of people think they have to do something to not feel sadness. People don’t understand that you can feel sadness, that’s what it means to be human. It’s not okay to allow that sadness to overpower you and make you feel like less of a person. when you’re overcome with a lot of emotions, you’re presented with a opportunity to learn how to cope with the emotions instead of smoking it away. Some of us, those who smoked heavily between 18-25, never really learned a way to properly cope. That’s why we relapse. Bc it’s so difficult to find coping mechanisms that don’t include drugs and self indulgence. You don’t have to do anything right now. Just sit and be with your thoughts. Just don’t become your thoughts. Meditate. You got this. 

EDIT: I’m not relapsing because I want to show all of you that staying clean is possible. I know I’m not in a position to do anything great in my life right now. But if I can help you guys by staying sober then I’m going to do it. Thanks for helping me as well.",11

The cravings were MUCH stronger than yesterday. Still had the mental fortitude to stick with this though. 

Per my pervious post, it’s been distraction galore over here. Movies, games, painting, juggling (I juggle a lot) or whatever it may be, I just need to get my butt up and stay busy so I don’t think about it.

Especially these first 2 weeks I’ve decided not to place much stress on myself for using these things to distract myself. I don’t plan on switching weed for games or whatever, but at least for the initial hump I’m using these things to keep my mind busy.

My nausea was really bad yesterday too. Little tip that I’m finding though is soups/ramen are easy to keep down vs other things.

Someone recommended pedialyte. Definitely want to try this and have some melatonin just in case.

My sleep is still going good. Slept like a rock again thankfully. I remember having a crazy dream last night, but the details have already escaped me. I just remember waking up and being like “wow, that was crazy”.

Other than that things are still going well. I miss it, but I know I need to do this to grow. My fiancée and I talked and even though she doesn’t plan to quit. We came to an agreement that she won’t bring it around me and will lock it up when she’s done. I even gave her the keys to my stash safe so I’d have to ask her before anything happens.

That’s about all I’ve got to report from yesterday/this morning. I’ll keep you updated on my journey as I go along! 

To those on or starting the journey like I am, we’ve got this!",23

2019-10-13 05:21:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dh8c1n/3_days_sober_long_post/,3 days sober (long post),"Ive been smoking weed since my 2nd year of undergrad (2015). I started smoking during summer and winter breaks with hometown friends and later I moved out of the hostel to a pvt apartment and started smoking full time. The final semester was crazy and by the end of undergrad I realised that from it being an occasional activity with home town friends, it became a regular college thing. I always found a way to manage my work side by side and despite of all the smoking I even managed to get into a great college for masters. Smoking did not cause me any harm career wise(atleast not yet). Before i started my masters degree I made a vow in June 2018 that I'll be quitting weed because somewhere deep down i always knew that it had made me waste a lot of time, despite of my achievements. I became disconnected, unavailable, neglected distant friends and family, and procrastinated all my work and duties. Hardly found time for anyone and got self involved. I did/do not have any illness or problem in life that i needed to run away from - just that i enjoyed smoking weed and like everyone else, i enjoyed it a LOT.  

Fast forward 1 year, I found myself consuming more weed than i use to during my undergrad. It again became a regular thing. It became my first chore after i woke up. I went high for work, for classes, for movies(especially movies), for gym and what not. I always somehow found a way to convince my self that it is okay to light up that joint. 

Now is the most crucial phase of my life and 3 days ago I decided that this habit of excessive smoking has to stop. The primary reason being the uncontrollable urge and how it made me feel that i have no control on my mind body and actions. I did not like the way i always gave in. I hated the fact that my will power (which has always done wonders for me) was being punched in the face, occassionally more than twice a day. Ive now been sober for 3 days and had not felt the urge until just right now. This urge is the reason I'm writing this post. Just to get these thoughts of my mind.

The thing with weed is that one never knows when they end up getting addicted to it. And once they realize, they still do not accept it because hey! Everyone knows its non addictive!! The first thing I had to do is to accept that I'm addicted to it. All the good things i had read and learnt about weed are the reason for this situation today. Its a good medicine and no doubt it helps a lot of people in many different ways. But it being a medicine is the reason its so dangerous. Because medicines are safe right? The feel good property of weed is why i got hooked, but i must say it feels even better to take this step and see the number of sober days increase daily. I honestly am not sure how long I will be able to not smoke because i had almost convinced my self that 3 days is a good time and now i could use a joint and go off to sleep. Trying my best to not give in. Will wake up tomorrow and start my 4th day 💪",4

I was a daily smoker for almost 5 years, my habit left me debilitated and barely managing my life. I was caught in this feedback loop of smoking so much my grades would reflect it, then feel low because of it, and then smoke more to not feel bad. It really was my coping mechanism for all my problems. I somehow managed to actually graduate college, I still think that's a miracle, and get a good job with great people in an industry I love. But I couldn't shake my habit, I wasn't ready to yet. I would bargain with myself that this would be the last bowl, the last J, last time I pick up, the last time... But I was never able to stay clean for longer than a few days at a time. Being forced to not smoke during the workday and then coming home and trying to pickup where I left off has made me realize that weed itself was the cause of my horrifying anxiety and panic attacks. Three weeks ago I was finally able to stop myself on my own motivation alone. Prior to this the only breaks I was able to take were ones that had extenuating circumstances like travel or availability but even then I would somehow mange to find weed wherever I was to feed my habit. Tonight I was forced to realize that the girl i'm hopelessly in love with will probably never feel the same way about me and I felt devastated. The only thing I wanted to do was light up and numb the pain. I'm really shook how strong the feeling of wanting to smoke was after feeling so damn good these past weeks. I really am starting to feel like myself again, and I almost gave up all this progress in a moment of weakness. I'm sitting here writing this after having called my mom and opening up to her about my usage and my struggle with getting and staying clean. It feels like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I've always been ashamed of how dependent I was on weed and actively hid it from all my friends and family, who let's be honest, were well aware of it this whole time. I guess I wrote this wall of text to talk myself down, and the desire to smoke has passed, so it worked in its own way. I've made it this far and I know I'm strong enough now to stay clean.

A few observations:

After 3 years of daily vaping/smoking cannabis, I'm finally celebrating 42 days sobriety. What's embarrassing is how I told myself poor eating habits and terrible gut problems, deepening anxiety, guilt, desire to quit but never actually quitting, the panic attacks, total lack of creative productivity, emotional distance and lack of interest in things unless I was high, the messy thoughts and hypochondria, and the hiding it from my kids...after 3 years of this hell, I still told myself: 

""It's not the weed I'm smoking, daily, every day, for years and years, all this MUST be happening because of something else."" 

Well, I'm done with cannabis despite how much I enjoy the state, smell, and initial experiences. I'm done with cannabis despite how much I enjoy the nightly routine, and my weekly routines, and how great music and movies were experienced. I'm done despite the fact I received jars and jars of cannabis free.

When I finally quit - for good, I mean, - and came to this community, I noticed these facts:

1) By the end of the first month, my gut issues are getting better. Less and less IBS symptoms. 

2) By the second and third weeks, depression isn't nearly as bad or frequent. By day 40 I barely notice the depression.

3) Week four and five, anxiety still comes and goes but isn't as deep or nearly crippling and constant. Anxiety was killing me when I wasn't high. In order to be free of anxiety, I needed to be very high, all the time. It was a monstrous loop and I had to pull myself out of that snake pit, trusting things would get better...and they did.

4) Initially, some sweats and insomnia. As time goes on, and this one is a surprise. It's really getting to me...hard to fall asleep, and waking early and not falling back to sleep. 

So. What milestones might I expect, knowing everyone is different, in the next few weeks? I hear it takes 90+ days for everything to heal the body and mind of heavy users.

I don’t understand why quitting seems to help the majority of people but it just seems to make my life even more intolerable.,"For the first two weeks I barely slept and thought about killing myself every day. Now I’ve had to start taking mood stabilizers again after being fine for months without them. The side effects are coming in stronger every day now, but I have no other option, other than going back to weed. Which really isn’t an option. It’s bullshit. Why the fuck does this have to be illegal. Maybe if I had a dr prescribe it to me I could keep it under control and reap the benefits without so much blow back.

On top of this I lost nearly all of my friends over this. I know they’re fake friends for not reaching out after I quit but even fake friends are better than no friends. I hate smoking but I hate not smoking more. If shit doesn’t get better in the next two weeks I’m quitting quitting. Fuck this.",18

Between being a sedated zombie and fighting the good fight. 

If you choose to fight the good fight and build a life for yourself that you’re proud of and that you can enjoy without being drugged - respect. 

Life is brutal. This is why I started smoking but also why i quit. I want to tackle my problems instead of numbing myself from the pain. 

Hope that reminded some of you why you chose to quit and gave you some clarity.

But when I got my own vaping pen at the start of this year (I was in a bad place and thought it would help me .......) things escalated. For the first few weeks I was able to just use it on the weekends at night. And soon I got the urge to get high on week nights. I thought why not? Soon I had to push myself really hard to go all week without it to hit up on the weekend , because I felt that it wouldn’t be good to do it every day. And then pretty soon by the time summer came around I started to do it every night and couldn’t justify going a night without it. I would just get baked and watch tv or listen to music alone ..... and then sometimes I would get so high and feel like I was having some sort of enlightenment, spiritual experience but then often the next day I would feel like crap. Have some sort of hangover . And then I would think nah this stuff ain’t worth it. I’ll just do it on Friday and Saturday. To chill. That never happened. 

I admitted I have no self control. The only way I can stop is if it’s not within easy reach. I can say I’ve been probably getting high every night since the end of May, minus a week here and a week there when I went traveling and decided it wasn’t a best bet to risk bringing that stuff through security. (I did consider it though and I’m glad I did not because yeah you never know). 

This past week things have been weird. Getting high no longer feels that great yet I kept trying because I missed the feeling. For some reason taking some hits just made my head hurt and unable to sleep , and gave me even nausea. One day this week I felt like I had the flu or something and part of me is convinced That it is not the flu but a sign that my body does not want to be constantly bombarded with THC.

I know things are going to be hard and I’m going to try my best to post every day. I’m fine during the day, I hardly feel the urge to get high during the day but I know nights will be difficult . I’m both extremely excited to get this out of my life and deal with my problems head on in more effective ways, but also tbh I am extremely terrified . More excited now though but let’s see how that turns out in 10 hours",7

Sorry for the long post!!

I turn 26 in a few months and I’m making my first real attempt to quit smoking. I started smoking at 18, not long after my best friend in the world died from cancer and I started college. I have not gone more than maybe 10-14 days without lighting up and that was while on vacation. 

I work in healthcare now and l should not be smoking as it is considering I work for a drug free workplace, but I just haven’t been able to quit. Even after I had a panic attack over how to pass the drug test.

I’ve never felt forced to quit, my family and friends are all cannabis friendly so I’ve never felt wrong or bad for smoking. In fact a large portion of my social life revolves around it. When I was a waitress in college it didn’t matter, but now I have an incredibly stressful job (that I love) and the only thing that helps me chill out after work has been smoking. I work in behavioral healthcare and some of the things I see and deal with are traumatic, not to mention they are 12hours shifts multiple days in a row. 

I’m really afraid of what is to come, I see many people struggle with sleep/ eating/ nausea and mood among other things. I don’t want the withdrawal to hurt my ability to function at work. I also have ADD and I take adderall for it, and weed is what I use to help myself chill out and it helps with the side affects.

I’ve been on this page most of my morning but I’m looking for any advice out there. Or maybe just reassurance I’m not going to die without it... (kidding). It’s going to be rough but I know I need to do this for myself.",0

I denied it for years, and looking back I should have seen the signs sooner.  Im 21 and had been a daily smoker for the better part of 5 years. It didn't really evolve into a problem until I got to college and didn't realize that I couldn't do what I was doing in high school, which for me really was HIGH school. I'd smoke every morning before homeroom and reup during lunch, and before my extracurriculars. I played soccer in the fall, did the musicals during the winter, and played tennis in the spring. And I was pretty good at the first two, tennis was more of a all my friends did it so why not.  I got to college and actually made the soccer team as a walk on, played like 4 games until I saw that I couldn't keep up with the rest of them if I didn't stop. But I didn't. I joined the theater department, and saw that I was having a harder time trying to juggle my school work, rehearsals, and my pot. Again, I chose it over something I genuinely loved to do. My grades started slipping, and by my sophomore year I was on academic probation. I was high before every class and when I wasn't, I was a zombie sitting in the chair. One of the big differences between college and high school I noticed was my income. Everyone always talks about a broke college student, and that was me. When I was in hs, I had a job at a local deli and all of my income was disposable. In college, I was part of work study and making significantly less and I would choose weed over the necessities. There were times I did thing I'm not proud of, like stealing from my suite mates just to grab a dub to get me through, selling my iPad just for a little bit more. I began isolating myself from my friends as they weren't the biggest fans of smoking which I think is my biggest regret. When I couldnt get any on my own, I'd scrounge up what I could find in the spots I knew people smoked at. Roach here, roach there, specks people left from rolling up, i didn't care because it got me high. I dropped out after my junior year, which was more of the same and I'm pretty sure my GPA ended up being like a 2.3 or something like that. I'd tried quitting in the past, but always came running back into the warm embrace of Lady Mary Jane because I just couldn't see my life without her. This past summer was kind of a wakeup call for me when a family friend of ours noticed I had gone through an ounce in 2 weeks. My tolerance was so high because I rarely took a break for more than a couple days, I just had to keep smoking and smoking just to feel anything. So I went to a one week on one week off sort of thing. But that turned into 2 days on and my quarter was gone, so I'd get another. And another, and another until i was back to where I started. I decided I needed a career change and left my shitty retail job for a warehouse job where I smoked the night before the interview, took the drug test the day of, and somehow by what is nothing short of a miracle passed it. I haven't smoked since starting this job because god forbid if I get hurt and have to pass a test for liability sake, I don't want that getting in my way. Today marks one month exactly since I stopped smoking and I'm not looking back. I didn't want to get to the point where weed wasn't enough and end up overdosing on heroin like my father did. I know that's a bit of a leap, but I also know I have moderation issues and an addictive personality. I had a problem with gacha games too but that's not a story for this sub. I want to thank everyone in this sub for sharing their stories and helping me realize that I wasn't alone. I first discovered it a few months back when someone on r/askreddit posted that what are some subs that most of reddit doesn't know about or something like that, and that's really where it all started for me. So again, thank you all and anyone reading this that is having trouble staying clean just remember: it can be done, and more importantly, you are not alone.",6

But you don't really understand it until you've been in the thick of it.

I was having the first great day since quitting and my wife came home and reacted poorly to something that I found kind of hilarious (my 5yo son sleep-walked into the bathroom, opened a drawer and took a piss right in there, then closed it and went back to bed) she didn't find this funny as it was her drawer of hair stuff. It was stupid of me but for some reason I got so offended that she was so upset and killed the first good mood I've had in 10 days that I stopped talking to her, basically pouted, and went to bed.

Today, as a 32 year old, grown ass man, I was so emotional at work that I felt like I was holding back tears all day. Then my performance review was up and I found that despite a glowing review, I had not gotten the promotion that I worked so hard over the last year for. If there was any wind left in my sails, it was gone at this point. When the safety net is not there anymore, it's really easy to question your worth. I know that I had a spectacular year. I just wish I didn't care what other people thought; something that was a lot easier when I was smoking 

I'm sorry for venting. Im really happy that I made this choice to quit and I know this is all part of the process. But I'll be dammed if this isn't the worst I've felt in a long time. Thanks for being such a supportive community. I owe a lot of my success to you all.",2

How are you doing today? Spare no details.","I was diagnosed with CHS about a year and a half ago. I have been to the ER maybe 7 times because of my stubbornness in accepting my diagnosis after the first episode. I was an extremely heavy user, daily. One morning after binging on concentrates for weeks prior, I woke up extremely early and abruptly feeling terribly strange. Then I felt the nausea and immediately rushed to the bathroom. At this point I began uncontrollably vomiting until I was thrown into a panic attack. At the ER I had lost mobility in my hands and feet, numbness in my face and stomach (later found out this was my first panic attack). I thought I was going to die. By now I realize that is a symptom of panic as I now am treated for anxiety and also have a therapist. I was given an IV with two bags of fluid as I was still continuously vomiting nothing but bile or just dry heaving. Zofran did nothing to ease the nausea. I was given I believe 2mg ativan before I eventually started calming down from my attack. Later the nurse talked to me about my habits after running several tests (blood, urine, abdominal CT scan) and I was honest about my THC consumption out of concern for my safety and health. After all the tests came back normal, they pulled me aside and explained they believe I have CHS as I was in or close to some sort of toxic shock? I don’t completely remember how they phrased it but “shock” was absolutely mentioned. Septic shock I think they said. Not that I was having it but that I came close I think. It’s been a while since then, sorry! Also I was heavily drugged so my memory of that day is quite hazy. 

I was in denial and continued to smoke (yes, I know. Regrets.) and landed in the ER about three more times before I started to accept it. I significantly cut back all my consumption to pretty much a dry herb bowl at night. No more concentrates or anything to this day. I eventually snowballed into daily heavy usage again, just no concentrates. I still fell sick and landed in the ER with hyperemesis once again. 

I began to worry about all kinds of things like cancer and such due to having insane bowel movements. Sometimes diarrhea and then other times constipation. Colon cancer runs in my family and I started to see thin stringy stool when It wasn’t diarrhea. In turn this started to ignite panic attacks. Before all of this happened I had been otherwise healthy. Varsity sports in high school and then military service for four years etc. no prior medical issues other than self diagnosed IBS as I ALWAYS had issues with having to go quite frequently. They just were never dibilitating. I still wake up nauseous and sometimes my anxiety triggers nausea and the viscous cycle repeats causing the other to become more severe. It’s like a seesaw that never stops going up on both sides. Anxiety on one seat and my digestive symptoms on the other. 

I’m am in constant worry that I have caused irreparable damage to my internal organs and I have not had any kind of scope testing done (endoscopy/colonoscopy). I am a 26 y/o male and am well aware of how rare it is for someone m age to develop cancer or anything so I try to reassure myself that I am just having hypochondriac theories. But then of course I begin to wonder, what if I’m wrong and I’m ignoring something that desperately need to be checked? I’m sure some can relate. 

My question to those who suffered through this and then successfully became sober, how are you doing today? What are your bowel movements like? Or your digestive system in general. Feel free to be descriptive as at this point I am purely concerned about health. I could care less about something sounding gross. Do you still experience symptoms or episodes? I’ve read some experiences where people quit and are alleviated and then others where they say they quit for 90+ days and then still have the hyperemesis but happen which leads into the idea of CVS rather than CHS. I’m willing to quit indefinitely in order to fix my GI system but am afraid of being too late. It has caused my to pretty much destroy the social life I had as I’m constantly stuck in my home groaning in some way about something, clutching my stomach or sitting on the toilet/in the bath or shower. I keep reading things on the internet about cancer symptoms even though I KNOW that is a terrible terrible habit to have as it often will send me flying into a panic and lunging for my Valium. 

I just want to know if full recovery exists. And if not, what are you dealing with? I don’t want this to be what subdues me. I had to drop out of my college courses and quit two jobs. I’m now in a ridiculous amount of medical debt etc. 

Can anyone relate? What is your story and how are you doing today? What was recovery like from bowel movements to the morning nausea to diet an activity? Social life? Any and all details are seriously appreciated. Thanks to anyone and everyone who takes the time to read this. 

I am now on the total sobriety journey and",1

It makes me feel like a pussy filled with crippling anxiety most of the time. Why? Probably cause of past insecurities that I’m still healing show more while high or I might be too sensitive to other people’s energies. Also I noticed I started to smoke for myself and to cope loneliness, boredom, and make excuses like “ ahh I deserve it I did a lot of work today” . then the second I smoked i either feel good or feel bad but either way i feel a lot of anxiety around strangers and I feel like I look disgusting while high. It’s become a habit that just does nothing but wastes my time and also slows down my brain power and school work. I had dreams when I was a child to be a very intelligent man, both socially and intellectually and I am a fighter and am going for it. Fuck wasting my time doing absolutely nothing.

I worked a couple very long shifts the last couple nights and had today off.  I got a good workout in, and just wanted to relax.  Threw some NetFlix on and have just chilled for a few hours.  Then, out of nowhere, the cravings hit.

There is still a little in the house, my wife smokes every other morning or so when she gets off work to help her sleep.  I told her to hide it from me.  It didn't take me too long to find it - but still 20 minutes.. that was the first bad sign.  I was in auto-pilot mode.  I managed to stop searching a couple times only to obsessively go back to it until I found it.

As long as I keep myself from doing all the other things that came with weed (I've also stopped video games, porn, Mnt Dew) then I will be fine!

But I couldn't do it.  I can't wipe out my progress.  I know that the guilt will be there tomorrow.  I know that I will use this reset to justify another misstep.. whether that is tomorrow or another 11 days from now.

2019-10-11 20:08:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dgnjqc/me_weed_and_bad_habits/,"Me, weed, and bad habits","Hi! It's nice to discover this community, and while I'm not sure if I'm searching for a solid advice or just some sympathy and understanding, I'd like to share my struggle.

I've been smoking on and off (mostly on) for the past 7 years or so. I feel like the main reason I smoked weed for the past few years is because I remember how good it used to make me feel. When I started smoking I was in high school, and it was new and exciting. I remember most people were really into drinking back than, and while alcohol was okay in small portions, weed felt like the right drug for me. I remember feeling free and happy, especially the summer after high school, when I didn't have any responsibilities and I could just sit at friends' houses or in nature and smoke all day...

I'm not sure when it changed, but for the past few years weed made me feel kind of nice at best, and really bad sometimes. I have severe anxiety, and I started feeling more and more anxious when I smoked, which is why I tried to quit many times in the past few years. The problem was, as long as I had weed, I have to smoke it. So I bought weed, smoked almost every day until it was finished, told myself I should never ever buy again, but the longest I could go without buying was about 3-4 months.

I've stopped smoking again about 2 months ago, and while usually I have a really hard time stopping, this time it was much easier, because almost everyone I know stopped smoking regularly. Also, in the past year I started drinking a bit more, and smoking and drinking made me very, very anxious (there were nights I went to sleep feeling like I'm gonna die because my heart was beating so fast). I also started having some back pain because of an injury, and even though weed can help people with pain, for me it made it a lot worse. So after a lot of suffering I stopped buying for now.

I still want to smoke sometimes, but less than before. I smoked a joint about two weeks ago, because I got it as a gift from someone who doesn't know me well and didn't know I stopped, and while I know that I'd smoke more if I had more, I didn't actively try to smoke in this time, and even said no to a joint offered once.

While it is a progress, I feel like I'm still stuck with some bad habits. I smoke tons of cigarettes now, from 1-4 a day I went to 5 or more. I drink regularly, and while I don't think I'm close to being an alcoholic (I almost never drink alone, it's usually 1-2 pints of beer, I drink more than that only on weekends and special occasions), I feel like I do it to replace getting high every nights, and it bothers me.

I think my main issue is that I don't really know how to limit myself, in weed and in a lot of other stuff. I tried talking about it with therapists, but I usually stopped going before I could even understand how to start working on it (I had some really bad experiences with therapists in the past few years, and now I don't really want to start again, at least in the near future).

My life is not bad. I'm not always happy, I have some issued I need to work on, but I'm a functional human being, with good friends and a supporting family. I do consider myself an addict, but I feel like it could be a lot worse, and I'm happy it's just weed and not alcohol or anything worse. But I feel like I'm always gonna come back to smoking, making myself miserable while searching for an unreachable, probably romanticized, feeling I used to have years ago.",7

First off, let me start by saying that from the 10 minutes of browsing so far, this looks like an awesome subreddit. Thank you to /u/JinxM4ze for posting about this subreddit on /r/AskReddit. 

P.S. Just a little warning, this might be a little long but here we go.

I'm on day 3 of my highly numerous attempts at quitting. The withdrawals have never been this bad. The consistent feeling of a stone in my stomach that prevents me from eating. The 2-3 hours of sleepless nights. The mental breakdowns, the depression, the panic attacks, the negativity, the hopelessness, the suicidal thoughts. Feeling tired/weak/malnourished/groggy all the time. I hate every moment of this. All of it. It's so extreme this time around (probably cause I was also vaping cartridges as well) that I didn't even know these were withdrawal symptoms until I read a post on here. Most of my previous attempts withdrawal symptoms consisted of usually just diet, sleep, and a little more depression and negativity than usual but nothing super alarming. This time around it feels like I could actually die (I know I can't).

All the physical aspects are manageable. They suck and it's frustrating and I hate it... but it's manageable. The part that I have a very hard time dealing with is the mental aspects since I've had a lot of these problems even before I started smoking (honestly, part of the reason why I started smoking) and with these withdrawal symptoms, they become almost unbearable.

Nowadays, I relapse a lot because I'm lonely. Very, very lonely. And I don't know what to do. I just moved back home temporarily after not being here (aside from vacations/holidays) for almost 4 years. I have no friends here anymore, I've reached out to all of my previous friends and they have all moved on, which I understand. I still have one person where we maybe might meet up once every month or so but she's very busy with her career, school, and relationship. My family and I aren't close at all so I really have no one to go to. I've tried meetup.com, online dating, discord channels, irc, and everything else I can think of but nothing seems to stick. I'm going to keep on continuing to try but it's hard. I don't know how long I'll last. A lot of the times I just think of substitutions like alcohol or cigarettes which wouldn't be a step forward but a step backward in my opinion. So at this point, I just need help breaking the cycle of being so lonely that I smoke weed, quitting for a few months, feeling too lonely again, smoking again, etc. Anyone have any experience with loneliness and using weed to fill that void?

TLDR - I relapse/smoke weed because I'm very lonely. I've tried to go out and be social/make friends but it's not working. Any tips? 

Also, any tips on oral fixations would also be a huge help :).",7

Today is day 21 of no weed for me (yay!) I left the relationship I was in last night. We’re going to take time apart and then hopefully be friends afterwards. I’ve known this is something I needed to do for awhile and I’m proud of myself for doing it, but now I’m scared I may smoke weed to mask my feelings of loneliness.

I know smoking will only make me feel good for an hour though and then all my feelings that I was running from will come right back + anxiety and guilt from being high. So I must feel these emotions. Last night I had a good cry and some screaming to release anger and sadness. Her and I parted ways on good terms so I feel good about that. It’s just that the newness of not smoking and not drinking already feels isolating and then to leave the person I hung out with a lot makes the loneliness feel heavier. I know deep down I’m doing the right thing though. Just posting to get my feelings out. I know I will meet someone new when the time is right. No rush. For now I will keep remembering to love myself :) and to stay strong and not smoke. Face these feelings head on

My problem is I always manage to convince myself that I'm back in control and can manage a joint here and there. Which of course completely backfires. 

Once upon a time I used to only smoke occasionally, and before it became an addiction I really enjoyed getting high. Now, each time I spark I hope to get that old feeling back but it rarely comes. I smoke now because I need to not want to.

Will I ever enjoy smoking again? Or will it always end up leading me back to addiction?

Yesterday was my 25th birthday and I wanted to have one last “hurrah”.  Now day 1 starts. I’m a bit nervous about it all. 

I always limited my smoking to after work, so I know I’ll probably be fine until this afternoon. I’m just scare or what this evening will bring.

I think I’m going to try some meditation. I used to do a lot of chanting, but over the years pot took precedence over that.

I talked to my councelor and she told me to get on r/leaves and find other support networks. Another thing she recommended is just to write a letter to “Mary” and see where that takes me if that makes sense.

It’s scary at times. I get depressed, but I know that smoking is not going to get me to a better life. I’m scared though, for instance my Fiancée smokes everyday and doesn’t wanna give it up. It just gives me anxiety thinking about that stuff. 

Idk I did the math yesterday too. I’ve smoked basically every day since I was 18. I’m 25 today. I did the math based on how much I smoke and over the past seven years it’s amounted to over $36,000. I don’t know It just makes me feel very ashamed when I see that. That’s almost a years salary where I’m at. I could’ve taken some dope trips or got better job training with that kind of money.

Anyways here is to day 1 and healthier choices.",6

2... I dream A LOT. Doesn't stop, it's kinda nice to know brain is recovering and I'm in rem sleep when dreaming. 

3... Still get stressed but not as much. 

There's a couple other things I want to kick now. Like fapping, it's a time sink and cannot be healthy. 

I've been playing world of warcraft classic, was an addiction for a month but now the game is boring. Slowly coming back to real life again.

2019-10-11 01:03:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dgaaf3/a_familiar_place/,A familiar place.,"Day 0, once more. 

Feeling as if you’re “home” is a wonderful thing. The soothing sense of familiarity, the assurance of consistency, and the comfort of warmth. As I grow with each day, I realize that sometimes you don’t feel at home and it’s the exact opposite of that wonderful feeling. The warmth gets replaced with a sense of cold, the shakiness of unpredictability, and the fear of the unknown. 

In these fearful moments, I turned to herb, and kept puffing smoke until I could barely see around me. The terrifying, new opportunities that were perceived as overwhelming continued to be so, but were just comfortably hidden by all the smoke. My desire to search for that feeling of a true “home” disappeared and was met with complacent acceptance of this comfort I had created for myself. 

This habit is completely unsustainable just as it is compulsive. It is completely better to dive straight into this new, unfamiliar territory with clarity rather than pretend it doesn’t exist and smoke it all away just to maintain a false sense of homeostasis.

If given the chance, maybe I can find home in these unfamiliar places, as the smoke clears.

Today marks my 40th day of sobriety! I'm ASHAMED these last three years have been a haze of depression, anxiety and artificial happiness. 

&#x200B;

I'm SAD that many memories have gotten lost in this haze, and instead of memories, I have a trail of FALSE STARTS, desires to quit and quitting for a few hours, then binging again, then going off cannabis a month, telling myself I can consume once a week...but this is my weakness...

&#x200B;

I fall into a loop and gradually the joys I shared with cannabis transform into REGRET, and then ANXIETY, and then stomach troubles, and then PANIC attacks. I used to write reams of pages and read and read and think about good memories and want to create more, but quickly all I thought about, more than sex, more than family, more than Christ, more than sleeping, was how good it was going to feel HIGH but I never felt the same high as I did those first few months. 

&#x200B;

My brain became a RUSTY DOOR and the cannabis, only when I was high, and only now and then, became the WD-40. And I would eat and eat and eat and feel sick in the morning, and zone out, and tell myself and everyone how good cannabis really is, how it calms you, and heals your gut, but only when you take it with increasing amounts. This lie was another LOOP. 

&#x200B;

So, providentially, my dear friend calls me and confesses - before I ever bring anything up to him about my feelings and habits - what he's experiencing. He's experiencing the horrible thoughts, anxiety, candida/thrush, zoning, hypochondria, etc. etc. etc. He couldn't function without it but when got high it seems all he wanted to do was not think about anything, or smoke more, or quit. For YEARS AND YEARS and YEARS.

&#x200B;

So, if you're reading still, and you're just beginning, keep hiking that mountain. It's a good climb, and you sweat out a lot of nasty toxins, and you may fall, but get up and keep hiking. The more you climb out of cannabis, the more beautiful life becomes again. 

&#x200B;

What is the summit? I don't know if there IS a summit in life. Or, better yet, there are many summits, the ladder is unending, don't get stuck on the bottom rung. Look at me. I craved and loved cannabis for too long, talking myself and those who love me into addiction. But that addiction isn't who we are...but the addiction magnifies negative aspects of ourselves, and we don't like to acknowledge this, so we use more, and for longer periods. You don't need the WD-40. Just use the door, more, and the rust will flake off, and you'll be on the other side of your mind, finally, where you were always seeking, IN YOUR HEART.",28

I feel like it took a big part of my personality and fucked my social life because of the anxiety it causes.

Actually fixing my problems instead of masking them is another flaw I have to fix.

No more.,"I quit yesterday. Today is day two. I’m 29, resigned from my professional job this week in pursuit of big changes in my life, and realised weed is one of the biggest things that needs to go as well. 

I just came desperately close to telling someone very close to me what’s been going on, but turned to this page instead- I found it yesterday and it helped me get through day one. I’m just not yet ready for the potential judgement and subsequent explanations that potentially comes with someone close knowing. 

I feel like I’ve lost everything that makes me me. I have a similar story to many; used to love smoking, especially with friends, enjoying that time and space together, doing silly (but funny) things, listening to music in the sun... but for a long time now it’s just been the light at the end of the dark tunnel that is my day- the only thing in my daily routine that gives me some sort of joy, a release. I even recently noticed myself taking this huge breathe out after that first smoke of the night as if to say “you did it, you got through the day and deserve this”. But I can’t do it anymore. Week days consist of a tired and slow wake up, shuffle to the coffee machine while coughing a bunch of  gunk up, tiring drive to work, do whatever I can to get through work and race home to receive my prize.  

I’ve had a year where my life was turned upside down, weed was a big part of my previous relationship and my ex refused to give up with me in the pursuit of a better relationship and quality of life. In hindsight I’m far better off without them, but the grief and loss has been hard to overcome. 

I’m ready for a new life. I want this. I’m going to get it.",8

I've been only a lurker on reddit, never posting anything, but now is a difficult time for me and I really need some kind of support, because I've decided to put all my strength and focus onto quitting weed for real this time and not just make a half-assed attempt or deceive myself that I can take a break and then begin smoking like a normal non-addicted person.  
First, I wanted to thank you all for creating and contributing to this sub-reddit, I browsed a bit and I want to say that I really enjoy the positive community vibe here and I hope to participate and contribute as well.  
With this said, I hope it's not too much to just put myself out here with a post of my own experience and just share what my soul is aching to share for there are very few places that I feel would really understand. I will try to be not too lengthy with my post and please excuse my not too perfect English as it's not my native language.  


I'm 25 now, I've been smoking for the past 8 years, each year smoking more and more, till I got to the point I smoke at least a gram a day, mostly through a double-chambered bong, ripping these huge hits all at once, usually alone. I had breaks that took from a week to maybe 6 weeks, but not more in the past 4-5 years, each time I would start smoking either in a strong emotional turmoil/crisis or thinking this short break is long enough that I can start smoking again but casually, each time I would start smoking almost more than I did before. It would be even more frustrating as most people around me didn't seem to have such a big problem controlling this habit or are able to function a bit more than me while doing it. Don't get me wrong, for quite a while I was able to do a passable job in both work and academic areas and talk to people while high, but in the long-run I wouldn't be able to continue most of the jobs, reasoning that they were too boring, unfulfilling or stressful and just recently I quit university for the second time in my life, again, making excuses that I'm just not suited for uni life, disappointed with the poor quality of studies (I live in a bit poorer region of EU), etc etc. Also, I find that I almost have no friends and a very stagnant social life and more and more loneliness, which at first I thought I was combating with weed by making myself less anxious.  


I wonder how many of us, who have befallen into the grips of marijuana addiction, as I've tried a lot of different substances, but none did for me what weed would, also suffer from some kind of other psychological ailments. Depression and anxiety are common ones, but what I find more detrimental is that I have somewhat of a schizoid personality, which makes me easily enclosed an enveloped in the stoning process and kinda not needing anyone else, but not really (as far as I've read schizoids - which avoid social contact, actually do long for intimacy, but have deep rooted fears about it being impossible to achieve) and low self-esteem, coupled with being highly self-critical. Weed just takes all of that away, but it also stops all growth in these areas, so as years go by, I do not make any progress and even regress in some areas.  


Now it got to a point where it's just too much. I'm now 6th day sober, because I feel I will completely destroy myself in this path, I've spent thousands and thousands of euros on it, slowly drifting into debt, I have life goals and aspirations, but they just seem further and further away and quitting uni seems like actually a step back, my longest romantic relationship was with a narcissistic nymphomaniac for half a year and every other attempt just fails in a month or two, relationship with my family is deteriorating, I eat tons of shitty food while high, which affects my digestion, my mental health was never at its best as I've been seeing therapist for three years now and I do see definite improvement in some areas, but as she doesn't specialise in addictions, she can't help me with that specifically. I have a kinda stable job, but it doesn't lead anywhere career wise and my social circle has diminished tremendously and I often feel lonely.  


I'm determined to quit for good now, but I'm really afraid I will relapse like many times before, because weed seems to be able to push my buttons very specifically and I just recognise it as a true addiction. Today I've seen another therapist, who specialises in addictions and his verdict was that I have a serious illness and the only way for me to get out is to rehab in this centre for about a year, but a year out of my life with all the debts seems just too much and this news came kinda crushing for me. I've tried ayahuasca, mushrooms, meditation, i'm doing yoga, eating healthy, I excercise quite a lot as my job requires me to be physically active (I deliver food on a bike), everything did and does help in it's own way, but usually I quit for some time until I relapse into heavy smoking again. I'm considering to try out some support groups like NA (don't have MA in my country) or maybe the Minesotta program. Just really determined to get the help I need and start living my life instead of kinda wasting it and so here I am as well, in hopes that maybe here is the place where I kind find support and also give my support to others that are in the same or very similar boat.  


All advice and just any kind of comments are welcome, especially if there is anything that you relate to. I hope this wasn't too long of a post, just really wanted to get it out there. Thank you for reading or/and just being here.  


Stay strong and healthy,

I have known since about the end of my high school career (17-18) that I should really stop. Since then my relationship with weed has been either I focus on quitting or I resign myself to smoking until i have the emotional energy or whatever to go through trying to quit again. I suppose I must have a lot of subconscious attachments to weed. The concious logic is very real as to why i should stop. I can see how so many new door ways would open for me if I were sober and my life is in a pretty shitty spot and smoking isnt helping whatsoever.

 So typically when I decide to stop, I will have a sincere decision, write out the reasons why I want to stop, and feel pretty good about it, like I'm finally escaping this prison that has held me for so long. 

But then the next day rolls around and I just dont give a shit. My mind conveniently forgets the reasons why I need to stop, and when I remind myself of those reasons I just absolutely dont give a shit. I say 'fuck it you know, I'll stop one day...' and even though I see the falsehood in that statement knowing the only time to stop is in the present, I just dont care. 

I'm at a point where I have continued making the same choice to smoke over and over despite my reasoning that my decisions to stop now feel like it's pointless or that I have no power. I seriously try to set the biggest intention within myself to stop and concrete it within myself but nothing has changed. 

I dont know how to go about this. I feel like I am at a point where if this is my life, to just get high all day and not give a shit about all of my dreams then i might as well not be alive. I mean this is fucking ridiculous. I have no idea what to do. 

Still today is day 1, I am visiting my brother in a mental hospital he got admitted into recently so I am using this as a reason to stay sober. I need to stay sober so I can be as open and supportive for him as possible.

It felt like I was 19, I blinked, and I was 25.

I quickly identified my daily Weed usage as my main problem which **needed to be eradicated**. I'm sure like most of you, I'm wasn't able to have weed in a box in my room, and dip into it on the weekend or whatever; if I had weed in my possession, I had to smoke all of it until it was gone.

It had played a key role in **destroying relationships** (friendships, business & romantic), and overall man, I was just way off-kilter: I would be **really bad at keeping track of things,** **no desire to socialise, people couldn't rely on me for anything,** **slurring my words, my finances were consistently in the red,** **I would always sleep during the day, productivity was effected massively.**

Aside from the problems listed above, the main realisation that finally tipped me over the edge to quitting was, with constant weed smoking, you're always hitting that dopamine release button. This tricks your brain into thinking everything is gravy, everything's cool, everything's A-OK, when really, it isn't!

So yeah man, I'm about 2 months clean, and just cleaning up my life, pursuing new skills, focusing on becoming the best version of myself.

Just wanted to introduce myself and share my story, glad to be part of this group.

Peace,

I've been with my girlfriend for 5 years. She hasn't always been a daily smoker, for the first 3 to 4 years of our relationship she would smoke occasionally and had no problem with me being high throughout the day. During the last year she would say that she finally feels ""caught up"" with me as she would smoke every night after work. Mind you this still isn't nearly as frequently as I would smoke but nevertheless it was daily. When my anxiety came and hit me like a train around a week ago she was with me and she believes it wasn't caused from the long abuse of weed. After reading up on this subreddit and seeing other people with the exact same experience as me I just knew that it has to be the cause of it, since quitting it's gone away immensely and im so happy about it. 

The thing is she feels weird with how things are now, because after knowing me for so long as a pothead all of a sudden a switch flipped in me that made me decide I was done with weed. She still loves me and cares for me the same but she just says that things are so ""different"". I believe most of this is because during my withdrawal phase I'm very emotionless and not the same person I have always been, I explained to her that in time my body will get used to not having weed as a euphoric crutch and I will be the same fun guy she knows and loves.  I'm 21 and she is 22 and I know a lot may say I'm young and she may not be the one but I'm a very philosophical and emotionally intelligent person and I've never connected with someone like I do with her she's truly my best friend.  I guess I'm just looking for advice on ways to help her go through my weird withdrawal phase in case any of you guys have gone through this same thing. It may also help to mention that her smoking while I'm quitting does not make it difficult for me whatsoever I'm very determined on the decision I made to stop.",1

At the same time, my mind doesn't appreciate any extra time nowadays. When I don't smoke weed, the time seems to pass so incredibly slow! I don't want to have this time. I don't want to have the time to think the awful thoughts my brain keeps on repeating. I don't want to have the time to feel so so so lonely. I don't want myself to be able to, once again, come to the conclusion that I have failed and I am broken. I want the perfectionist in me to keep silent, because when he has a voice, he makes every minute of my life a torture. I feel a bit hopeless about the future and weed helps to numb the pain of it. 

But I have been doing that for way too long. I know a change can be made. I don't exactly feel that way, or believe my life can change for the better, though. How do I deal with that? I guess the problem is that what lies ahead of me is really difficult. It turned out that as a result of being raised by an emotionally abusive parent, I have psychological issues. The perfectionism, the social anxiety, self-loathing, inability to trust anyone... all that can be worked on. I am not naïeve, though. Therapy is not a magical cure. It's hard work, without guarantee of success. And if you do succeed, you won't suddenly be a care-free person. You'll be all the same, only less extreme. Your issues will be manageable, not gone. 

So I have to give up my warm weedy mind-blanket in order to feel all the awful things my mind wants me to feel until I can get actual therapy, that most likely will make me feel even worse until it makes me feel slightly better. Yay. Like for real... even my anxiety is less when I smoke regularly. Not to mention the negative thinking. 

I had been diagnosed when I was sober. I managed to stay sober for two months at that time. As soon as the diagnostic process was over, I relapsed. Some of the diagnostic sessions were awful. Especially the last one - to conclude the whole thing the psychologist read the summary of my story out loud. So basically what my childhood looked like, with the outlines of the most traumatic events, the descriptions of my attempts to deal with it, listing the people that used me and made me even more distrustful. All of a sudden I felt so much pain. I felt like I was little again, and looking at my life not understanding why. ""Why me? What did I do wrong? It's so unfair."" 

At that last session I was told that it will take at least half a year until I can start going to therapy. And the clock is ticking. At this point, it's been two years already, since I had to hit the pauze button on my bachelor study. One more year and my exam results won't be valid anymore, so I'll have to start all over again. Trying to add up the months in my head I already felt the waves of hopelessness, anger and sadness. Some of you probably had similar experiences. The mind just kinda fixates on one goal: getting away. So I ran away by getting high again. 

I regret it now. It was easier to quit the previous time. I had the help of a specialist and the big motivation of having to be sober to be allowed to be diagnosed. Now both the motivation and the help is gone. I don't want to turn to a psychologist for help anymore, because I'm afraid of how it would affect the waiting time for the therapy. Maybe they could even revoke my diagnosis, because I'm not sober anymore. 

Holy cat, I just looked at the amount of text I produced. Thass a lot. 

Anyway, I guess my motivation now is to just get a clear head and get my smarts back. I don't want to neglect my house and partner anymore. I don't want to neglect myself. I want to start getting better now and I want to believe my life will get better.",10

I started because i’ve always had really bad anxiety and heard marijuana could be used as treatment. now that i’m a few days sober my anxiety has been through the roof, but it’s not about being sober. My anxiety is about my direction in life (recent college dropout) and my suicidal thoughts are coming back. over the past week before quitting i was having nearly daily panic attacks and intense stress and smoking was the only thing that would quiet the noise. without weed my anxiety and add have come back harder than ever and it’s making me feel like smoking again. i want to quit but maybe now wasn’t the right time? 

i know anxiety is common in withdrawals but in your experience was the anxiety about quitting or life in general?",3

The reason I'm posting is I've been a longtime lurker. Every time the old familiar TRUTH comes up in my consciousness that i am NOT the best version of my self, and the TRUTH that my life will never progress forward or be anything like my potential if i dont stop.

A little about me: smoked first time at 13, didnt do it regularly until 15.. after that it was on the weekends with friends.. then eventually after school... and by the time I was 17 I was smoking all the time and had developed an oxy addiction. Fast forward to age 22, I am homeless, have had endocarditis, overdosed, injecting anything that will dissolve and might produce an effect. At 19 I had started using heroin and had already been to a bunch of rehabs.

Eventually, these drugs destroyed my life quickly (this is why weed is worse)... I went to treatment, ended up moving into a sober house and was taken through the 12 steps for the first time... so at this time I put together 2 years completely clean... ended up smoking weed again.. luckily i have not touched opiates since may 2012... but..

I'm sure everyone is familiar with this but... I will ""just smoke weed"" so that I don't go off the rails with worse stuff...

So now, about a year ago I put down the hard drugs for good... but about 3 months in, I started taking CBD full spectrum oil, which had some thc again. It set that thing off in me and i started smoking again...

After that, I met my current girlfriend, who is great.. but she does not know me except high...

It is just deja vu for me, counting all the relationships I fucked up because I would rather be high than be present.. and this one is no different.. I am watching the same thing happen.. I am repeating the same behaviors..

Same with business... I refuse to get a job because I have had various random entrepreneurial success and live this fake ideal of some stoner business guy that just does fuck all all day... continuing to lie to myself..

I am sorry for the ramble, but I have to speak up and say something I'm sick of being alone in this battle. So few people get addicted like this... I can't sleep, I get extreme acid indigestion, absolute panic attacks, I sweat through all my clothes..

my heart knows I need to quit and my life is going to just suck if I don't... again I'm sitting here after being up all night HIGH thinking about NOT SMOKING... I have an eighth of weed in my car and a pipe and I want to start this journey so bad but feel so damn alone and I have no idea to do with myself... the lies in my head tell me to just go smoke it and start tomorrow (tomorrow never comes)... the real me wants to go flush it but I also know the anxiety and regret that happens right after..

I've quit cold turkey a few times before but it's never been this hard. I'm smoking 3.5-5 grams a day. No fucking idea how to get through this.

Cliff notes:I can not consume marijuana and live a happy life, no matter how I lie to myself about it. I am completely incapable of moderation and this drug is ruining my life.",58
2019-10-10 10:14:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dfym6x/day_10_its_hard_but_getting_better/,"Day 10, it's hard but getting better","Today I join the double digits club.  This is the second time in years that I've abstained from smoking for this long (current record is 14 days). 

My journey hasn't been an easy one. My first week was filled with panic attacks and crippling anxiety.  Towards the end of week 1 I could feel my anxious periods getting less intense and they resolved more quickly.  So far, week two has been better. My anxiety has been present in the mornings but melts away around lunch time.  Even though they are less severe, the anxious periods still taunt and scare me, filling me with fear that I'll never recover. That fear causes me to sink deeper into anxiety.  

Last night I slept an entire 8 hours. Since Sunday, I have been able to eat full meals and even started putting on some of the weight I lost the first week (which is good, I'm pretty skinny).  I started a weight lifting routine Monday and also started running daily.  Also, I began reading again; I haven't read a book in years.  I have had no cravings since quitting.

Even with this progress, the challenges still exists. This morning has been a challenge, I woke up from my 8 hour sleep because of a vivid night terror, the nightmare was eerily poetic but horrifying nonetheless(I can share details of anyone is curious). When I got out of bed, I was angry at everything. I even yelled at my dog because he was trying too hard to get me to play with him.  As soon as I snapped at him, I immediately felt like a piece of trash and gave him a hug and gave him all the attention he needed.  The look on his face and his recoiled demeanor when I yelled at him was heartbreaking to me. I know this will pass, I just need to keep myself in check. 


For those of you suffering after quitting, it does get better. For those of you that have been here, please offer continued support.  

Thank you,

I'm 24 y/o and i've been smoking since 15-16. The quantities and frequency increased over time.

I started smoking because of how i loved getting high and how it helped me fall asleep.

I've been having thoughts of quitting for a few months now, as i didnt love the place my head got into when i got high, i had been having a lot of dietary issues, anxiety and a lot of memory issues. But i just couldn't get myself to actually go cold-turkey. ( i've tried reduction and slow-paced quitting a few times, without success).

9 days ago, roaming reddit high, i stumbled upon r/leaves and spent over an hour reading the motivational stories of people who decided it was their time, not for hate to the plant as i think i will always have a love/hate relationship with it, but realizing it just isn't for everyone and it was stopping us from leveling up in life.

I spent the next day thinking a lot about it and decided that it is my time . 7 days in i feel so proud of myself and i trully am feeling much more love of life, productivy, general well-being and a sense of self-control that i felt i had been losing over time.

I just want to thank you all for existing. thank you all for sharing. thank you all for this space of compassion and understanding that it's hard to get within your own life. I feel more motivated than ever and i honestly give that to you, r/leaves.

Stay safe everyone, let's be better. And let's help eachother reach the place each one of us wants to be in.",4

I have health issues with my stomach that make me want to vape some flower as it really helps my pain and nausea and the drs havent offered me any other drugs that work as of yet. I also suffer from anxiety which I use certain strains to vape and relieve. You could say weed is my crux.

I’m 16 years old right now and I started smoking weed when I was 12. First it just became thing to do because it was cool. Every summer from age 12 I went to work so I had money to use of course I used all of it to weed... 

When I was 14 I started to smoke everyday 2-3g in a day I had no responsbilities so it was fun to do with friends just chill and eat food when munchies kicked. At this time it was a like a hobby to me I didn’t see any negative effects from only the money I lost which did not feel bad because I had ”lot” of money from work. 

This summer 2019 I have used only this year thousand and thousand of Euros in weed and I started to see the negative effects of weed like not able to go sleep without weed, not being able to enjoy food without weed and also I started being very distant to my family and friends. Like I said I smoked weed with my friends only because I tought it was boring when smoking alone. But this summer I just used to smoke alone never called anyone or tried to connect with people who care about. 

I really now regret weed because I turned so many things down cuz I just wanted to smoke weed and jerk off, eat and chill. 

Now I have been trying to quit weed but it’s hard because my whole friend group was based on weed so I have been trying to avoid going to that exact friend group. In reality I just got more distant and got lot more anxiety. 

Couple months ago I went to buy weed from my plug realizing I had no money. To be exact I spent 2700€ on this summer only to weed and munchies...
It’s really big amount for 16 year old and it kicked me in the nuts so fucking hard. I went to work only one purpose on mind to buy weed with that money when my job ended I and got money I just really didn’t want to smoke weed it just feels disgusting.  After that when I smoke I didn’t get good feeling just regret and disgust. 

I started to connect with my other friends more and started to excersise. I didn’t even think about weed anymore and I have no urges to smoke anymore and I am very very happy the urges just disappeared. Before the urges always took over me and I couldnt handle myself and.

I hope this makes sense at all :D 
But yeah I’m SO much more happier now and feel like people around me matter and I matter to them.

5 days in and the sweats and shakes are pretty much gone. I can sleep again (still a bit broken, but enough sleep to feel human in the morning). I have an appetite again and I’ve been way less irritable today. I actually have very little doubt now that this is very achievable and I can stay weed free.

2019-10-10 04:15:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dfuvjt/experience_cannabanoid_hyperemisis_syndrome/,Experience: Cannabanoid Hyperemisis Syndrome,"As recreation marijuana sales in more and more states are gaining popularity, so is a syndrome called Cannabanoid Hyperemisis Syndrome. Never heard of it? You are not alone. Since marijuana sales are still technically federally illegal, not much research has been done on the subject in the United States. As the rise of easy access to marijuana has climbed throughout the nation, so has the number of cases ERs have seen involving symptoms of CHS.

CHS is characterized in people with long term, weekly (but more often daily) use of marijuana. Sometimes it happens to people with years of long term daily usage, but in other cases like my own, it can happen in a matter of months.

I first started smoking marijuana frequently in 2012 and started experiencing symptoms of CHS in early 2013. I went to visit my now-boyfriend, and after a night of drinking, woke up to severe upper abdominal pain. It was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life—it felt like someone was pushing a knife constantly into my diaphragm. Thinking it was just a bad hangover, I brushed it off and tried to eat normally. Almost immediately, the cyclic vomiting began. And lasted a long four days. When I was finally able to travel (just forcing myself on a plane home), I landed and was immediately taken to the emergency room. I was in excruciating pain and vomiting uncontrollably. This caused me to become extremely dehydrated and on the verge of passing out. The ER had no idea what was happening, and gave me two bags of IV fluids, doses of nausea medicine and heavy painkillers. Finally after the painkiller was administered, the abdominal pain ceased. I was in so much relief to be out of the pain and was able to stop vomiting, but now had a long journey ahead of me as these symptoms continued for an additional seven years of my life.

For about four years, these symptoms continued on without anyone knowing what was going on. Weirdly the only relief I would get was when I took a scalding hot shower. I don’t know how I knew to do this, but one day while in pain and vomiting uncontrollably, I jumped in a hot shower and actually felt some relief. I didn’t understand why, but now I know hot showers actually work to help regulate body temperature, which is somehow affected by cannabanoids. 

I did not disclose to doctors how much marijuana I smoked at the time, since I was a daily user and didn’t want to be labeled a “drug addict”. But after about a dozen trips to the ER over those three years, my family and I had enough—we needed to figure out what was going on. When I had been hospitalized twice on an international trip, vomiting for days on end and in horrible abdominal pain, I was forced to go to the ER twice in three days. Being sick in a foreign country was a bit scary, but luckily the nurses and doctors were so kind and helpful that I felt somewhat comfortable. Still, being in a foreign country and getting sick was traumatic. I felt helpless and just wanted to get home. I then traveled for a week afterwards with stomach pain, but luckily not vomiting, so I was able to make it home in one piece. After being at  my wits end with these continual symptoms going on, I was checked into a hospital room and stayed for a very long 28 days.

Over this month, dozens of tests were administered. X-rays, CT scans, endoscopies, a colonoscopy, gastric emptying studies—you name it. I even had an exploratory laparoscopy to see if there were any holes in the internal layer covering my organs. The tests revealed absolutely nothing, showing I was healthy, and the stay ended up costing well over $100,000. I also went to the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, and even they were puzzled by my case—more tests were done, some inducing horrible pain, but the best diagnosis they had was cyclic vomiting syndrome, but it didn’t explain my severe abdominal pain during these episodes. The financial toll this syndrome has caused over the years has been astronomical and has put me and my family in an increase in debt and caused financial troubles. 

But still, I continued using marijuana on a daily basis, thinking it would help with the nausea and vomiting. Knowing what I know now, this was the worst thing I could do when I was having an episode. Instead of helping me, little did I know my use was actually contributing to the issue. After another dozen ER visits to the hospital, my boyfriend read an article about CHS and noticing some eerily strange similarities with what I was experiencing. The hot showers were a big giveaway. Apparently people suffering with CHS always found some relief with a hot shower, although it was usually only temporary. With this information, a lightbulb finally went off—daily marijuana usage was causing all the issues I’d been suffering with for years with no answers.

The only cure for CHS is to completely cease smoking. Other than that, doctors and researchers don’t have a cure to this syndrome, as little research has been done on it. This presenting me with another obstacle—to completely stop using after years of daily marijuana usage. I thought quitting would be easy, but this was not the case. I have anxiety and depression, and found relief to these issues with marijuana. Over the years it became like a good friend, helping me through both good and bad times during my years smoking regularly. I also didn’t realize I had become psychologically dependent on the drug. So even after finding out that this was finally the answer to how to cease CHS, I continued using and couldn’t stop. This was now a whole other issue I now had to tackle.

After a dozen more hospital visits, I finally entered an Intensive Outpatient Program six days a week for a month for my marijuana addiction. Some people may think this is silly, but I have an addictive personality, so I just wanted to get better. Even during the program, I was still using because it was so hard for me to find the self-control and will to stop using altogether. After yet a few more hospital visits, I finally had enough—this time I was quitting for good.

This revelation came to me and I am now living a completely sober lifestyle. However, the damage has already been done. With over 30 ER visits in six years, I have almost certainly done irreversible damage to my body, especially my stomach and esophagus. And that is why I want to bring more attention to this syndrome, so hopefully others will read this and maybe find some answers. And hopefully avoid the years of torture I suffered due to my heavy usage of marijuana.

Hopefully marijuana will become recreational federally soon, so more research can be done on this syndrome, as no one has been able to figure out exactly what causes the syndrome, and why some people suffer from it while others don’t. However, I know if this happens, the number of people with CHS will skyrocket due to the easy accessibility of marijuana. But the more we talk about it and can share our own CHS experiences with the public, the more knowledge will hopefully be spread about this syndrome and maybe save someone’s life one day.",14

Why?","Hey everyone. This is going to be  a novels worth of reading and I’m sorry for that. Writing it out helps me feel comfortable even if nobody reads through. I don’t use reddit much and almost exclusively use it for talking in the CHS community as well as lurking in this one. 

I want to quit. 

I have been a daily smoker for something like 15 years (with about a 4 year tolerance break due to military service). I smoked daily and multiple times during the day. Basically every couple minutes I was hitting the bowl. In July 2018 I had been heavily using oil pens as well as smoking flower. I pretty much had a ritual of doing nothing but this all day everyday aside from my not so frequent obligations. One morning I woke up extremely early and immediately felt like something was wrong. I suddenly got nauseous to the point of knowing that I needed to get to a bin or the toilet ASAP and on my walk there felt so sick beyond all belief. It escalated very fast. The moment I got into the bathroom I started vomiting. Over and over and over and over again, even though I had nothing left in my stomach. I heaved up nothing but bile and then got to the point where I kept just heaving nothing. My body went numb starting in my stomach then leading to my hands. Then my face went numb. Later I would find out that this was my first panic attack. I genuinely thought I was dying. My gf quickly rushed me to the ER as something was obviously wrong further than the food poisoning I had first believed it to be. By the time I got to the ER I could hardly move. They quickly took me in and began putting an IV in to pump fluids. They gave me Ativan and zofran and tried to work with me to calm my breathing and explain to me that I was having a a panic attack but I only continued to vomit. My hands were stuck in a crab-claw like position. I had zero control over hat was happening with my body and I remember feeling genuinely scared that I was going to die. After many hours I had eventually come down from nonstop vomiting after many blood tests and a CT scan of my abdomen was taken. Results showed no abnormalities. This was the first time I was pulled aside and told that it was the cannabis causing this to happen to me. I was in so much disbelief that I halfway started to argue with her assuring her I knew what I was doing as far as weed went and that it was a major factor in easing my symptoms. I was in total denial. 

I eventually went home and stupidly enough, smoked to ease my nausea since the Zofran was not working. Throughout the rest of the month and then the next, I wound up in the ER something like 5 times. I also ended up in several urgent care centers. Uninsured so I have stacks of medical bills (yay). I became genuinely afraid of death and began to have frequent panic attacks. 
          Before my first episode I have never experienced the symptoms of a panic attack before. Now I am prescribed Valium to counter them as they still happen quite often since then. Last month(Sept 2019), I ended up in the ER again. I had not reached hyperemesis this time since the initial episodes and coincidentally had stopped use of all concentrates. I was so close to hyperemesis that my body locked down with the numb panic attack symptoms and complete loss of control despite taking a double dose of my Valium to bring it down. I was beyond nauseous with absolutely no appetite and was trying with every fiber of my being to not let that first vomit happen because once it happens the first time, there was no stopping the rest. 

Halfway through this most recent ER visit, I calmed down enough to talk about what was bothering me. I complained about my stomach having a full throbbing ache in the central abdomen just below the rib cage. I had nausea that was so bad that it took of every bit of mental energy to hold it back.  I told them about my CHS diagnosis and was honest about all my usage and everything. I told them I was particularly concerned about my liver, pancreas and kidneys as something felt very wrong with my bowel movements. They were sporadic sometimes leaping between little puffs of bile clouds (sorry I know that’s gross) to diarrhea to straight up constipation. They took a bunch of blood vials off and came back several hours later to tell me everything looked normal. My blood oxygen levels were good. Etc. I don’t completely know what all was tested for in my bloodwork and I have trouble taking a doctors word sometimes because I can be such a hypochondriac. I have a fear of misdiagnosis and the lack of information around CHS only amplified this fear. Finally at the end of the night when I had come down to a tolerable level, another doctor came in and explained that I had gastroparesis as a complication of CHS. He then told me I needed to refrain from THC products for at least 90 days before I move forward with further evaluation. 

Despite the absolute hell that CHS continuously puts me through, I keep smoking. I hate my addictive personality and I hate having no one to blame but myself. I know I’m in charge of my own willpower and I ultimately have the power to say no and I have every intention to. But then I start to feel sick.. either from the awful prodromal symptoms of morning nausea from CHS or withdrawals. This immediately triggers a response of somehow weaseling some way to rationalize using it for my nausea this one time or something even though I know it only worsens it in the long run. I do not want to tear myself apart and yet I continue to do so. I give in to temptation far too easily and it has been preventing me from quitting. One of my biggest fears with the withdrawals are the vivid nightmares I get. They are SO intense they have me waking up hourly in a sweat sometimes screaming out. Thy are so vivid it can leave me shook up for the rest of the day. Often they are dreams of me getting shot or something that involves myself dying. 

Does anyone out there relate? Thanks for the read if you invested all your time. And I’m up for answering anything as reddit is currently the glue keeping me sane at this point. Much love everyone.",3
2019-10-10 03:23:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dfugje/first_day_sober_and_first_post/,First day sober and first post,"Hi everyone as the title says this is my first day sober (willingly) in a long time. This may be a bit of a ramble so bear with me.

I (20yo) have been a daily smoker from about the age of 17, originally smoking a joint a day with a friend but quickly progressing into smoking alone and from there into smoking bongs just to keep myself numb. I suffer from moderate to severe anxiety with a side dish of depression and so the day I discovered weed I thought I had solved all of my problems. I was one of those people that went on about how ""I'm still functioning!"" and ""My marks (grades) have never been better!"" this is merely code for ""I'm far too content with staying exactly where I am for the foreseeable future."" Anyone who has experienced mental health issues will know how dangerous this mindset can be when in a deep trough.

This year has been a rough time for me. At the start if the year I was a uni student smoking my way through life steadily sinking into a deep depression. I lost 20kg in less than 3 months that I could not afford to lose because I could not make myself food and had no appetite. Despite having a incredible girlfriend of two years I could not see any light at the end of the tunnel and did not see myself living out the year.

**Moving Forward**

Since this time I have moved back to my home town to try and get my mental and physical health back in order. I've had to teach myself to eat again and only now is food beginning to taste like anything but sand. Weekly therapy sessions are helping to address the root cause of my anxious tendencies; the same that made weed so appealing. Therapy also helped me to identify the rush of adrenaline/anxiety I would experience when I came down; I believe this was essential for me deciding to quit as it became abundantly clear the very thing I was attempting to avoid was being inflamed by my ""silver bullet"". At the moment I am working a job in gardening/landscaping I love and am beginning to enjoy aspects of life I had forgotten about (like just being in the sun or a beautiful clear winter morning in the best country in the world). My aforementioned girlfriend (who does not smoke) is coming back to our home town in two weeks and so this is a great goal to move towards as well as the boost of getting to tell her I'm finally taking this head on! I have also surrounded myself with my closest friends from high school that I had separated myself from; one of which had never been a fan of my usage but has been there for me every step of the way so far.

Throughout my day at work today I KNEW I wouldn't smoke this evening when I got home and almost felt relieved that I felt I didn't have to smoke. When I arrived home the normal anxiety that prompts a bong drove me to go for a run instead and man the feeling I got when I stopped was better than any weed you could tempt me with. Overall I feel like I am moving in a good direction but felt I could do with some help from a community who understands. I have no idea if anyone will read this far but if you have I sincerely thank you for taking the time to take in my story and I hope you enjoy your day/night wherever you are.",2
2019-10-10 03:09:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dfuc4h/day_4_was_surprising_pleasant/,Day 4 was surprising pleasant,"Hi everyone! I’ve been a lurker on this sub for about a week and finally worked up the courage to post. I decided a few weeks ago that weed was no longer doing anything positive for me and I wanted to quit. My grades are slipping, my relationships are crumbling, and my bank account is shrinking. After many attempts to stay clean, I finally made it through day 4.
I was smoking heavily every single day for over a year, and before then I was doing much harder drugs that I was thankfully able to kick (1 year and three months sober tomorrow actually!).
Quitting weed has been much more difficult than I thought it would be, mostly because I believed everyone when they said “it’s just weed, it can’t be addictive”. Withdrawals have been hell, days 1-3 all I could think about was how badly I wanted to smoke. It doesn’t help that my house mate is an avid smoker who will literally pack and smoke a bowl out of my favorite bong every night. I haven’t been able to sleep well, and when I do u have vivid dreams that when I wake up, leave me disturbed and distressed. I’ve also been getting headaches and crazy mood swings, especially yesterday. Also, every single small annoyance in my day gets me so angry for absolutely no reason. I know that this is only temporary, but it had been harder than I imagined it would be. Last night I felt like I was losing my mind, I was so sad and all I wanted to do was smoke the rest of the bowl that my roommate left out in the living room, but I was able to resist.
Today was a really good day though. I woke up refreshed and got to school early to study. I was productive and was finally able to begin catching up in my classes. And then this evening I watched my favorite TV shows and cleaned my kitchen. I feel much more alert than I have in a while and I’m really optimistic for the future. 
I was really struggling but I think today I caught a glimpse of the light at the end of this tunnel and I’m so so excited to see what life has in store for me next. I just wanted to thank everyone on this thread for being so supportive of everyone because it was so important for me to see all of this to get as far as I have :)",1

He ventures into unfamiliar territory now

The path before him is lined with uncertainty

Desperately he searches for a constant

A ground for his electric mind state

He finds himself overwhelmed by simplicity

Pressure plates push on his concepts of identity

His mind can be viewed as a mine field

Every wrong decision awaits it's moment to contribute to the chaos

The night is merely an arena 

For gladiators with no contenders

He's pitted against himself

Ill equipped for the opponent he faces

By sunrise he'll have survived 

Bruised but hardened

Ready to venture further down the path of uncertainty.",17

I gotta block her but I still love her which sucks.. I’d rather be drunk than be high, if anyone’s up to talk it would be great , I could use someone to talk to... today I fought my urges to smoke... I drove to the nearest church but it was closed, I just wanted to sit and pray. I feel upset, I upset my mother because I was rude to her when she got home . She thanked me for cutting the grass , yet I was so angry about not being able to smoke, I just was acting like an asshole. I feel so bad that I did that because I know she’s always there for me. I apologized and everything, but I still feel upset that I lashed out because I couldn’t smoke some stupid fucking drug.  I thought it was supposed to get easier as the days go on, it’s feeling like it’s getting harder. The only thing I’m holding onto is that feeling of complete peace sober, being totally clear minded and I miss that shit so much I feel like I haven’t been that way in forever. Can’t wait to get back there. Not gonna smoke again. I’m gonna beat this shit guys, I don’t care anymore I have to or else I never will.

I’ve decided that to stay clean I’m going to have to never touch weed again— which is a little scary to think about, and also difficult given how a couple close family members smoke daily and a lot of my friends are once-in-a-while users (legal state). 

But I’m so happy with quitting and so proud of myself for making it this far. Insomnia and lack of appetite are awful, but I’ve been coping, and the clarity and energy that I have already is amazing.

Believe me. In the past I was on this thread, countless times, talking about how I couldn’t stop smoking, I kept relapsing, I literally tried probably 1000 times to stop and couldn’t. Well about 8 months back, I did stop. All I thought about the last time I smoked was, how boring weed was. It just felt different. It’s actually even weird to say the word ‘weed’ now. I literally just stopped and didn’t look back. Didn’t have any urges. Didn’t even think about it like I would in the past. I even went to live somewhere for 2 months, and got offered it countless times and each time I said no and didn’t think twice about it. I still dont think about it. I remembered this thread randomly and decided to ask if this happened to anyone. And before anyone says, ‘well I was never really addicted’. TRUST ME. I would cry because I couldn’t stop. I felt like a failure. All I ever wanted at the time was to live my life without weed. And now I’m doing it. Idk if maybe me getting older had a stop in it? Anyone else randomly decide to quit and this time, with it being different, haven’t looked back?


Also let me add, I wouldn’t last over a month not smoking.",188

Have been lurking on this sub for a very long time, reading people's success and failures today I'm ready to quit and this time I feel confident it's for good.

Have been smoking cannabis for ten years now, daily for six years.
I chop up as soon as I wake, blaze all day then max out the high before I sleep.. Everyday.

Lost a girlfriend to marijuana induced psychosis, I feel that if it wasn't for me she wouldn't have ever smoked as much marijuana as she did.. massive guilt complex(she is fine now it just broke our relationship)

I've tried quitting numerous times even getting as far as a week sober, but always get enticed back with those thoughts ""Just one"" or ""why even bother being sober life's a mess then we die, may as well keep smoking"" or my favourite "" this is the last one""

It's been pretty hard though as my father is a licensed grower so my supply is infinite, home life is centred on marijuana and the smell is everywhere.. 

But I feel after a long time reading people's posts and relating so much with what they have said and just reflecting on my shit choices in life (25yrs old still live with the parents no education and can't drive a car because I'm always too fucking stoned and get anxiety about doing anything although the reason I smoke is because I think it helps the anxiety... stupid loop right?)

My brain is finally for real ready to quit, I need to get shit done.
Life is finite that's true, but why cry if all im going to do with it is get stoned and laze around wasting that life... I have the potential to do cool shit it's time I start.

I feel different, More confident.. This may be the 5th attempt at quitting but I'm ready..
I know what's in store so I've got some books, my little list of reasons to persevere, 5HTP, l-theanine and l-tyrosine which I may use to aid my brain chemistry get back to normal.. 

I plan on spending the next few days chilling out and reading while I get through my usual symptoms of withdrawals which is pretty bad anxiety, swingy moods, feelings of impending doom(like something really fucking bad is gonna happen if I don't get high) sweating and lack of sleep.

You all give me so much confidence I can crush this!

I hate smoking weed but I've been doing it forever. I met a girl who wasn't into smoking weed or drinking AT ALL which made me happy. I stopped for a while and slowly got back into it and hid it from her. She found out and I promised to stop. 

Three weeks ago on she came over to my house and knew I was high. I admitted that I was and promised to stop. The next day she decided that we needed a break. I accepted and respected her wishes. I said I'd do a minimum of a 90 day break with hopes of going longer. Today was the start of week 4. I haven't smoked or drank since.

Yesterday, she broke up with me with the hope of getting back together before Christmas.

Today I went to cut wood with a friend who I knew would have weed with him. He only had a pen on him (thank god) I was so angry about my whole situation that I decided to smoke and say fuck it. I put the pen to my mouth, pressed the button, inhaled a few times, but nothing happened. The battery was dead. I never actually smoked.

I called my ex-girlfriend and told her what I had done. Basically saying I'm sorry that I failed and I would have been high if the battery wasn't dead. I feel like I failed, but technically I didn't. The universe definitely helped me out.

Can someone please tell me I'm still doing a good job?

Quitting smoking after ~6 years of smoking and I am having WILD lucid dreamstates,"Hi to anyone reading this. My name is Ryan and I am a poly-drug addict, with my primary drug definitely being cannabis. I have smoked near-daily for about 6 years; 17-23. 
I have never really been able to remember my dreams, even throughout my childhood, aside from my fever dreams as a kid. This has especially been the case for the last 6 years, for obvious reasons. I am 10 days into not smoking pot, but have spent the last 9 days taking prescribed Valium for withdrawal symptoms in the night - Still no dreams during this time. 
Last night I went to bed stone cold sober and didn't take Valium even though I have a few left. This resulted in the most intense dreamstate I have ever encountered. 
I would like to start posting them here to get them out of my head. 

Here is my first:

I was aware I was going back into an INTENSE dream state however it was deeper than that and I was unable to distinguish my hallucinations from reality. 
First it started with me in my bed, but there was a window where my far wall was, and a house/roof (normal stuff), there was a woman/thing out on the roof. There was also an Asian woman in front of me to my left and I could feel my consciousnes's is perspective (my ""mind's eye"")) speeding towards her face in an intense way, but like I was ready for it because I knew I was dreaming, I initially thought it was kind of fun and was 'leaning into it's (not sure how much control over it I actually had tbh).  But then the dream layer got deeper and deeper, and I don't know if there were a few more strange intensities between then and my final layer (all felt like it occured within MINUTES, and that I was strangely aware up until a point), but the final layer involved my legs SINKING INTO MY BED, but at this point I thought I was awake and just groggy and that the whole leg thing was just a weird feeling from waking up from a dreamstate. Then they KEPT SINKING DEEPER, deeper than could ever be possible from a real feeling, yet I was still convinced I was awake. I tried to stand up, my torso got up, my room was EXACTLY how it was in real life; I lifted my hand to the door handle.... And my arms were invisible. I knew they were there, but the kind of shit cloaking invisibility from a movie, where you can s l I g h t l y see the outlines, but still straight through. I freaked out because I couldn't open the door and escape, then I woke up properly and ran out to the lounge room and screamed hoping someone was there.",0

As a 32 year old man, I feel very fortunate that my life's circumstances never lead me to alcoholism or opioids. Still, day 8 has brought on an anxiety and depression that rivals some of my worst times. I am more or less, a complete wreck. 

The thing that has always made quitting so difficult for me is the scary changes to my mood that follows after I stopped smoking. I had always convinced myself this was the real me shining though and that weed made me a better person. So I gave up, become depressed and disappointing in myself . It was okay though because I had weed to make me feel better. Right?

I think this is the first time that I'm able to see through that. I'm not happy because of the weed. I'm miserable because of it. It can't help me here. This depression and anxiety is the price we all pay for avoiding reality and applying quick fixes for real problems.

To all that are starting their journey, or those that remain steadfast on one of life's more difficult roads, you have my utmost respect. Be well.",17

Just wanted to briefly share my story as today marks an entire month that I have been clean and free of pot. Using cannabis has helped tremendously to help manage my stress and anxiety, but having been stuck in a shitty job I have had to stop in order to detox for the job search. It also took control of my life in a way that I don't want happen again, and I couldn't function without wanting to get stoned all of the time

Having done the deed for the past few years has also raised my tolerance to such an incredible level that I never really got high anymore, and that wasn't enjoyable at all.

The first few days will suck but don't cave in! It's remarkable the change in mental function, I can think a lot clearer now and I also feel better

I might partake in a much more reduced fashion in the future once I am where I need to be, but in the meantime I'll enjoy life without being dependent on drugs. By then maybe the tolerance will be far reduced",10

I've been in this sub for a while and I've been trying to quit for a while, too. I managed to not smoke for 7 months last year but this year I have relapsed again and again. One problem I face (I'm sure everyone else has, too) is old stoner friends. While I left many ""drug buddies"" behind without any remorse, as we only had weed in common, there are other old friends who are not so easy to abandon. I have many good memories that involve them and I feel affection for them. However, they do not share my belief that marijuana can be a real addiction and therefore do not see my efforts as something worthwhile. They believe I'm either exaggerating or going through a phase, so they really don't help me at all. In fact, every time I've relapsed has been after hanging out with old stoner friends. I can't hang out with people who are smoking without craving it. I think I really have to end some friendships if I am to stop using definitely, but it can be hard.

I went back to visit them mid summer, and smoked with them when I got there, just to try it out since I had not smoked in about a month and a half. Since returning to school, I have been more or less constantly smoking, and I can tell it is slowly going to take away things that are valuable to me (savings, health, education, career) and I need to quit. I have known this for a while, and have had many 'Day 1's"" that have ended with me back with my friends getting high. I acknowledge that to really quit, I am going to have to focus 100%.

Changes I've already noticed: I feel a lot less anxious, more confident, have spent more time with my family just this week than I have in a very long time, went back to the gym, and just overall feel good. That being said, I had one of the hardest nights last night.. I wanted to get an 1/8 so bad since I have the day off today and it took a whole lot not to do it. It was late so I couldn't go out and preoccupy myself with a physical activity but I ended up spending a long time on this sub (thank you r/leaves <3) and later watching netflix.

My dreams have been getting more and more vivid throughout the last 8 nights but last night was by far the craziest. I tend to take a while to fall asleep but once I'm asleep I never wake up during the night. My dream last night was so intense that I woke up twice throughout the night. For the most part of this dream, I was pregnant with twins. It felt very very real and I was confused and worried what to do about this since in my real life I am not ready for something like that  at all lol. Anyway.. when I finally woke up I was curious if this had any meaning behind it since it felt pretty random and this is what i found:

* ***An Immense improvement:*** *You always want the best for you...is it not so? We bet it is a YES! So when you are dreaming about twins this improvement could be right here with you. You might be struggling with bettering how you relate with people, managing your anger outbursts, it could also be something personal like overcoming addictions.*

I know this doesn't necessarily mean anything, but to me reading that felt reassuring and I am so relieved I didn't cave last night. There was a lot more along the lines of being on the right path and seeking improvement in your life, all of which I strongly resonated with. I feel like I am doing the right thing and this seemingly random dream just gave me a lot of motivation to keep pushing.

It doesn't matter where that motivation comes from, just focus on whatever keeps you going day by day. Sorry this ended up being pretty long and thank you :) Wishing everyone the best of luck!",8

After that I turned to drinking, every night, for about a year whilst my relationship slowly broke down.
 A year later I met someone new, he was a heavy smoker. So I got into that instead, thought it would be better than the drink!
For the past 2 years ive been in an abusive, destructive relationship that has taken all my confidence and left me broken. I broke free of that a couple of months ago, and am now facing life on my own, with no crutches. The weed had to go. Not only does it deplete my money VERY quickly but it makes me socially withdrawn and unproductive.

**TLDR:** One month in, and I seem to have replaced my addiction to weed with an addiction to the internet. To solve this problem, I plan to spend the next month properly off-grid, in a remote area with out phone signal. 


———


It's day 34 since the last toke. The noticeable aspects of my physical addiction seem to have faded. 


The listless sweaty nights are behind me. Cravings are non existent, and have been for a while. Days pass without weed once entering my thoughts. I can sleep with ease, unaided by pills. My mood swings have abated, and I can feel my short term memory getting better by the day. What a relief. 


But one substantial problem remains. I seem to have replaced my psychological addition to weed with an addiction to the internet. 


Thus far I have failed in my aim to exercise on a daily basis, or to fill my time with more constructive activities - reading, writing, creating on the computer. I feel a strong desire to do these things, but when it comes to it, I can never muster the motivation. Tomorrow, I tell myself, tomorrow I’ll start. Yeah right. 


Instead, to my perpetual horror, I pull out my phone and tap the Reddit icon, as if guided by an autopilot I can't switch off. And then I'm instantly distracted, any previous intentions quickly evaporate. Hours later I zone back into the real world, annoyed with myself for not having the willpower to resist - I briefly consider something constructive, but before I know it, I'm back scrolling through the news or flitting around YouTube. This cycle has repeated itself consistently since my last post. 


At first I was not too worried, better the internet than weed, said my logic. But now I am concerned.


Yes, I learn a lot whilst browsing, and I enjoy being abrest of world affairs - but do I really need to see what could go wrong if that pixellated stranger attempts a backflip? 


If I maintain this path, I feel my recovery will never be complete. It would seem that addressing this underlying desire for constant distraction is the crux of my sobriety.


So, a new phase of the recovery process is in order. I plan to do to the internet what I did to weed - to put myself into a situation where I have no access to it, to go properly off-grid. 


Fortunatley, the Philippenes is the perfect place for such an endeavour. A few days ago I  left my cushy paradise and travelled to Palawan. I’ve found myself a motorbike, and enjoyed a day of urban comfort food. Tomorrow I will head south along the western shores of the island, where I know there is no signal. On previous travels I met a Dutch man who lives in a shack on a beach, and that is where I plan to stay for the next 4 weeks. (hopefully he still lives there!) 


My bike is loaded with food and water, my Kindle is stuffed with books and manuals - everything from yoga to meditation and mindfulness. I have a minature solar panel that should keep the basics going. All that’s left is for me to take the leap. Fingers crossed. See you on other side.",7

Theories on this phenomenon?,"I'm sure many of you, like myself, have travelled and found it easy to go without weed when you do.  When I travel I do on occasion think that it would be nice to have some pot, but that quickly passes and I don't really think about it again.  Sometimes I do come across some when travelling, but I'm happy to just experience it once as part of my trip, and don't feel a need to have a stash like I do when home. 

 I've gone 3 weeks of work travel without really craving it, only to come home to basically a complete mental shift.  I would often immediately smoke after getting in my house from a long trip (up to 30hrs).  When I am home, pot is a big part of my life outside of work hours.

So my question to you guys is what is this phenomenon?  Why is it so easy to not smoke when away, yet so hard to go without when at home?  Is there a way to use this to shift our mindset when trying to quit?

Over the past few years I have gotten extremely ill, throwing up until I have nothing left, lost weight, and no appetite. It seems to happen when something is especially stressful. This sickness comes and goes. The only thing that made me feel better was taking a hot shower or rather lying in my shower letting hot water hit my stomach. 

Anyways it just happened to me recently, I was so sick that I wound up in the ER. I needed fluids and hadn’t been able to keep any food down. I thought I was going to die because I am a 5 ft tall girl and I normally weigh 105 lbs, but after being so sick I’m 96 lbs. I thought for sure I was going to have kidney failure from dehydration. 

So, at the ER, the Dr told me I am so sick because I smoke weed. She said it’s become more potent than in the past. She said that she sees more and more people with it everyday. This I thought had to be a joke. I use marijuana to help me when I do feel nauseous and to help give me an appetite. She said the only way to get better is to stop. 

I left the hospital feeling okay,but still a little nauseous. I went home and smoked a joint and tried to go to sleep. I was sick again when I woke up. For three days after I was still so so sick but I kept smoking and it would give me relief. When I ran out, I was too sick to go anywhere, plus I was basically going from my bed to the shower only. So the first day I didn’t smoke I was still sick but then it seemed to get a little better. Each day I didn’t smoke it got a little easier to keep fluids down. 

It’s been 4 days now that I have not smoked. I have stopped throwing up. I guess I just can’t believe that marijuana would make you so sick. Many of my friends smoke daily and they have never experienced anything like this. 

Has this happened to anyone else?",19

I went 5 days sober from September 30-October 5. I've smoked October 6-8, each time saying it was the last time, and excusing it because of a ""special occasion"". My spouse is a chronic pain patient who medicates with cannabis, and it is completely necessary for her medical needs. I, on the other hand, am not medically dependant on THC, but have habitually used on-and-off since around 2002 (was clean in '08-'09, '11-14).

I have held myself back professionally by passing up job opportunities because they would require a piss test, and when you smoke daily, they say it can take 60-90 days to pee clean after quitting. I am poor because I smoke, straight up. I've been making lifestyle changes trying to eat better, exercise, hygiene, living with purpose, y'know. Quitting THC has been the elephant in the room for me this whole time. I am doing all this bs to improve myself, and I look over my shoulder, and there it is, staring at me.

I am addicted to smoking cigarettes, smoking 5-15 almost daily since 2006. I quit those. I have had 3 cigarettes since August. I don't regret having those 3, but I also didn't enjoy them and I was able to recognize how gross they tasted and made me feel. I must admit I have been using a juul-like vapor product, that has nicotine. I have removed the combustibles from the equation, and I'm about to quit vaping as well, doing a course of Transdermal NRT (Nicotine Replacement Therapy) which takes about 3 months for me.

My spouse is quitting cigarettes, but quitting cannabis is out of the question. I need to able to resist the urge to quit, even though there is a state-licensed grow house on my way commute that I can smell from inside my car; even though my spouse smokes daily still.

Because my spouse still partakes, and I can tell first-hand that it does indeed help her immensely with her symptoms, I have to respect that it is a legitimate medicine. It's just not MY medicine. I am prevented, for this reason, from taking the mental shortcut of WEED=BAD and, instead, have to drill it into my head, that cannabis is just not for me.

I've taken to drawing symbols onto my thigh where only my spouse and myself would be able to see under normal circumstances. For example: A pair of eyeglasses with swirls in the lenses, to remind me that cannabis distorts how I see the world, and that's something I want to avoid now; a screw, to remind me to keep my head screwed on straight; 3-rings representing the neurotransmitters I want to be in balance (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin); and the date and time that I last smoked. This technique got me from October 1-5. Then I stopped tracing the lines to renew the image, and I forgot all my reasons just long enough to break my streak... 3 times. I'm re-drawing the symbols tonight.

Have any of you quit while still being in CLOSE proximity to cannabis?",8

I have smoked every. Single. Day. For 15+years now. Saying that outloud doesn't feel good. 

My partner and I went on a short vacation with the intention of quitting smoking for good once we got home. I have been home alone all day and its really all I can think about.

Its like there is a war in my head- mostly one that tells me how stupid i should feel for it being this hard, the nagging voice in my head ""people don't get 'addicted' to pot...you're just weak"", then I cycle back to thoughts of need- need to escape my anxiety, need to escape my depression, need to feed my habit. ""But isnt it better to treat all of these things naturally, then get on medications with their whole host of side effects?"" And I repeat this cycle over and over. 

 I'm stressed about how stressed I am, because somewhere  I do not think it's justifiable. It's been just a little over 24 hours since we've been home and it has crossed my mind every hour of the day. It has been a total of 4b days sober now. 

I live in a legal state. My partner and i smoke about a half every single week. It's an insane expense, to say the least. That alone should be enough, my brain echoes-- but my body, my muscle memory just wants to reach for the bong.  

I dont know what to expect really- i don't know what side effects to anticipate honestly. Ive been pretty irritable. Insanely stressed that my partner and I will fall out of love without pot to bond over.

I did this methodically so that there would be no room for excuses; smoke once during my day, go one day without. Smoke once, go two days. Etcetera. I did this till I hit a week of sobriety, then I stopped altogether. Now the withdrawals I'm dealing with seem to be primarily psychological rather than physiological.

The last week wasn't as difficult as I'd imagine (And I have been imagining this for 2 years now). I knew deep down I had to stop, for work and personal reasons. It wasn't easy either. Mostly nights and early mornings where the most difficult.  
I handled it well and tried to remain positive. Eating when I could and eating the foods I could stomach. I'm quite slim but also maintained my physical health. The mental side was and still is the real battle.

Alot of my thoughts and energy when I was stoned was thinking about how I can stop and what I would feel like when I was sober. Would I be more anxious and would my anxiety be cripple me? It was the opposite surprisingly. I feel less anxious and more alive than I have for nearly a decade. Weed is strange in the sense that you think it's helping at the times, when really it's holding you back and making the anxiety and social interactions much worse. 

Addiction is hard. Fighting your mental demons is hard. Having no one too talk to about your issues and covering up my addiction for years is hard. Quitting is hard. Finding the will power to make a change was hard.  But even after 7 days I feel much better, especially mentally. 

Sorry the big post. I needed to express myself somewhere, to someone as I've been hiding behind my addiction for years and my family and close friends have very little idea how bad my smoking addiction was. 

If I can make a one week, I feel like anyone can haha. I'm going to keep pushing forward to through week 2. I know it's going to be an ongoing battle for a while but I feel like I'm prepared to handle it now.",26

I want to smoke. I want to hide a cartridge and battery before he gets home so I can keep smoking. All of this is self imposed, he never asked me to stop smoking. I wanted this. I can’t put him in the position of being my keeper. I have to actually fucking do this.

But, as I'm beginning to process all of the things that I spent five and a half years running from through weed/drug use, I feel like I'm beginning to crave my first ever addiction/escape again - self harm. I'm finding myself looking at my scars a lot more. (Even though over the past four years I've probably only harmed myself just over a handful of times).

Both my parents went to Oxford university and I was expected to do the same, (I didnt I was to busy getting high) the pressure of being expected to be perfect and being punished for not being perfect every single day of my childhood made me into an anxious mess and weed made me forget about all that, even if only for a moment. 

Anyway she texted a long list of unreasonable demands that she was trying manipulate me into doing and it sent me spiralling DOWN QUICK. So I  ran outside to get the tobacco I'd thrown in the bin the previous night (because I was scared it was becoming my new addiction). But I couldn't bring myself to fish through the bin for it. 

So for the first time in 8 years I had to actually feel my feelings and they didnt feel nice. After an hour of hysterics I managed to call my dad and then my grama who helped calm me down and persuaded me to go outside.

I went to the bank to draw out some money but the bank told me that they had lost the transaction that was supposed to be in my account  8 days ago and had charged me fees for going into my overdraft. THE BASTARDSSS!!!!

Roll on panic attack number 2. 

I had to leave the bank because I was causing a scene. So I ran to Mac Donalds and bought some fanta. Sugar was my first addiction and I don't want to go back to it, but in that moment it was have some sugar, buy some weed or have a mental breakdown in the city centre at midday. 

I was supposed to go to band practise tonight but couldn't face it and was exhausted after having two panic attacks and arguing with bank people. So I came home and just cried. 

I guess I never realised how intense it is to feel feelings because I've being numbing them for so long. I'm not going back to weed because that feels like climbing back in a cage I accidently built.

I know I can do this. But DAMN THOSE FEELING ARE STRONG.

I went to get coffee, however, and realized that I’m already much less anxious - so that’s 1 positive.

I seldom drink but every hour I’m thinking of getting drunk to mask these withdrawal effects, but I know that the hangover will make me feel a billion times worse than I am now.

Had trouble sleeping only to realize it’s my boyfriends 4AM alarms and I’m just as sober as I was before (thank goodness). 

One problem I’m struggling with is motivation and getting shit done. I remembered how focused I was when I last quit and how I seemed to become a super women. 

To give some context, about 3 yrs ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer. I quit pretty soon after that because I realized i would not be able to take care of her and work full time in my stoned state. This was a no brainer quit because this was serious shit. 

After I quit, I worked out heavily, finally learned to swim, and couldn’t go a day without running. I cooked all our meals, worked hard, starting making a name for myself at work, and applied to grad school. I was sharp and loving the sober me. 


Somehow I end up smoking again and getting back to where I am today, quitting. I envy those days of my past sober self but I had a realization last night. You don’t just become some sober super women. You have to start becoming the change you want to see in yourself. 

Sitting around moping about no motivation and wasting time on reddit doesn’t get me back in super hero shape. Continuing to push myself to take care of myself, eat better, and not procrastinate is the only way to crack my brain back into shape. It’ll take time but the only way to get their faster is to push myself. 


I’m almost 3wks in and so proud of myself. But I’m no longer going to sit and wonder when the brain fog will lift and allow me to be great. I am fucking great and I’m going start by not only taking every sober day one day at a time, but also making the most of every single one!!!",3

When I first started smoking it was a one off at weekend, that became every day I had off work and that became whenever I got home from work I would smoke all night.

My reason for quitting is purely the cost aspect. I don’t mind being high, I don’t mind what it’s doing to my body, but the cost is ridiculous.

I’ve tried to quit and reduce my intake on many occasions and of course I couldn’t do it. I’m hoping that by writing this here I will finally have some motivation to quit!

Any advice, stories, tips or recommendations to help a dude that struggles every time would be very much appreciated.

I am day 1 today. I plan on keeping some weed on site just in case, I know this wouldn’t work for everyone but knowing that there is some there will keep me sane.

Please wish me luck, I get really bored without weed and I usually cave in because I’m just waiting out the night with nothing to do.

But I am oddly...tempted. I’ve been struggling with more cigarettes and drinking alcohol on weekends more often than I used to. Maybe that’s how I cope with the tough aspects of life now? I got really drunk this past weekend for a friend’s birthday and I felt really tempted to go get a joint to deal with the hangover yesterday and today. Most tempted I’ve been since the first few weeks. The only thing that stopped me is that I didn’t want to break my streak, as this is the longest I’ve ever gone without weed since starting smoking 10 years ago.

I was over 9 months free of tobacco since I picked up a pack a few weeks ago so I know how quickly my addictive personality can put me right back in the hole of compulsive usage. Tobacco and alcohol may be things I need to get under control and limit, but nothing has messed up and controlled my life more than weed has. I can’t afford to use it again and have a binge. It could be too catastrophic for my will and my life at this point. 

 I have a great new job I started 2 months and I know I wouldn’t have the capacity to do it well, much less have even gotten hired from it while I was still a stoner. I guess this post is a message to myself and a reminder on why I have to keep going. There’s this voice in my head that keeps trying to self sabotage myself, like I’m somehow an impostor for having this good paying job and that I don’t deserve this level of pay, lifestyle, and good mental health. And that since I’m not being disciplined with cigarettes and my weekend binge drinking, that I should just say “screw it” and break my sobriety with weed since I’m not truly 100% sober. It’s truly destructive thinking, but on some frustrating days the thoughts sound seductive. Which is why I decided to post on here for some clarity, and since I haven’t visited in a while. 

I scheduled an appointment with a therapist this week to get some more support, and I’ve been going to Marijuana anonymous meetings here and there so I hope I don’t slip.

Just in the 6 days of not smoking, I’ve already:

- started training again ( I used to workout 4 days a week, but had a 5 month break due to increased daily weed use in the summer)
- stopped eating sweets ( I normally have an insane sweettooth, that seems to have disappeared)
- cut down caffeine ( it’s just 1 cup in the morning now, as opposed to 2-3/d in an attempt to deal with weed comedown)
- cut down alcohol almost completely ( turned out to be a lot less fun without weed)

At my early 50’s, quitting weed and cigarettes after 30 years. Reached 6 months off both, no relapse.

Positive changes after six months:
- I do not need to sleep more than 7-8 hours per day, instead of 10+ when I was “high”.  I do not even need an alarm any more.
- Breathing is now much better, no coughing, no short of breath. That makes exercise and meditation more fun, too.
- I feel much “cleaner” inside and outside. Not smelling bad, no gastro reflux symptoms, no blocked nose any more. 
- Since month 4, I also have a tendency for less alcohol, less caffeine, not too much meat. In month 5, I quit coffee, completely (after 35 years).
- No strong cravings for getting high any more.  

Of course, not everything is fine. I still struggle with:
- A periodic anxiety (comes every week / two weeks, stays for some days, leaves) which triggers depression. Makes me not wanting to work / avoiding decisions / feeling overwhelmed.  As time goes by, I think that it cannot disappear any more (I have been diagnosed with mild anxiety / depression, stemming from over-achiever mindset.  That, I was self-medicating with weed, after all). Acceptance, meditation and cognitive behavioral theory might fight my depression, over time. I will try to refrain from any medication, at least till I reach 12 months weed-free (doctors agree).

- Feeling less motivated than before. Working, playing music, reading, fixing things, even having sex still seem a little duller, not so rewarding, not so important to get me moving. Only teaching and presenting in large audiences are still excellent. Maybe that’s aging, after all :  Missing the extreme “high’s”, while enjoying the swallower “low’s” - it’s a good bargain.  I read that some of you got your motivation back after 6, even 12 months. I will wait.


What keeps me going, when I am not depressed:
- exercise (gym with a trainer and alone at home, I try 4 times / week)
- meditation (daily, 10 - 20 minutes, headspace app)
- yoga and qigong (once a week)
- traveling, both through my work but also with my motorcycle buddies 
- my supportive, caring sweetheart
- psychotherapy (monthly), although I feel it reaching a plateau after 7 years with the same therapist.

No meds, no nicotine, no cannabis, no caffeine.
Despite the struggles, I feel determined.

Words cannot express the pure feeling of terror I get from these and often have to take anxiety medication to get through. Otherwise, I will spend hours trying to fall asleep only to wake back up every hour in a panic with cold sweats and all. When I manage to fall back asleep I tend to re-enter the SAME NIGHTMARE. this cycle throughout the night wakes me up so often that I don’t feel anywhere near rested by morning. I’m getting less sleep than I was when I went through the military and that’s a bit of an issue. Knowing I’m about to have a night filled with terrors keeps me reluctant to even want to try going to bed and reinforces my temptations to smoke. 

Has anyone had a similar experience to this? If so, how did you suppress it? I’m open to all ideas at this point.",5

For the last 4 years I have been smoking daily. At first flower, an eighth every 4 ish days, and about 6 months ago switched entirely over to concentrate/vape pens for convenience. I go through a 500mg oil cartridge every 3ish days. 

My entire world revolves around when I'm getting stoned next. Sometimes I'll go weeks and miss every obligation I had (besides work) because it doesn't work with my smoking schedule. Good God, and the lying. I lie all fucking day to carve out hours of time to be alone and high. I've dealt with bad depression during the last 4 years as well and recently have seriously wondered if it isn't the weed actually causing my symptoms. I basically just hate the person I have become and I'm so sick of feeling this way. I have half heartily tried to stop before, mostly for tolerance breaks, and it was really difficult for me.  I have the hardest time sleeping without weed. I have the most insanely realistic nightmares and right now am really dreading that. 

Even as I write this I have no fucking clue what I'm going to do when I get home from work today, but I'm not gonna smoke. This time I'm done. I deserve to live a life that I care about enough to have a say in it. Rather than just surviving and wishing time away until my next smoke session. Not to mention my wife is pregnant with our first child and I have 0 desire to be a stoner dad; or husband for that matter. If anyone needs to lean on me, go ahead and message me about anything. I'm surely going to be leaning on all of you. I find a lot of strength knowing you're out there somewhere dealing with this thing, just like I am. I believe in you, truly. Life is too short as it as, why would we want to speed it up even more by constantly numbing ourselves to the world around us?",18

She finally got up the courage to come back and get the help she needs but when she arrived she was in a wheelchair. It turns out she had a stroke and was unable to walk so we had to call an ambulance and I had to support her to keep her from falling over as we exited the airport terminal. Once they were off in the ambulance I rushed along behind them and when I arrived at the hospital I asked someone about the parking paystation, I had a small friendly conversation with them and suddenly noticed he had a wax pen in his hand. I wanted so badly to ask if I could hit it, it had been such a difficult rollercoaster of a day and I deserved it right. But I realized how stupid I would feel to be high in my girlfriend's time of need and how ashamed I would be of breaking my streak. If this couldn't make me get high I think I can make it through anything.",11

Time to stop for good.","Weed has been a huge part of my life for years. I’ve been smoking on and off, oftentimes very heavily, since I was about 14. Fast forward to now, I’m 24, living in a prohibition state and still playing this silly game.

I recently just came off a 30 day break because I had a major job change at work that filled me with anxiety, and smoking made me even more anxious. I told myself I would stop until I could get out of that situation. At first I wanted to quit forever, and I actually had a friend come over and offered him all of my stuff. He actually refused and told me to take a month off and try it again to see if I still like it. I did. For the first couple days I was loving it, thinking “why would I ever leave this?” But I also told myself that if I came back to weed I wouldn’t let it be an everyday thing. Yet, here we are. I’m in day one after smoking every single night the past week. Last night, as I was smoking a joint (alone) I just realized, fuck, what am I doing? I told myself it wouldn’t become an everyday thing. Just a hit or two before bed to unwind or a joint with friends. Meanwhile I’d been smoking myself into a stupor for the past week.

So now I know that I can’t moderate. And now, weed still gives me anxiety. Living in a prohibition state and having a serious job, the first 15-20 minutes after I smoke I always end up stuck in my head with anxiety. After about 30 minutes it wears off and I can enjoy myself, but those little waves of anxiety aren’t worth it. I know I’m addicted because when I’m sober I wanna get high, but as soon as I do, I regret it. It makes it so that I just fry out and waste time. I can’t focus, I can’t read a book, or throw myself into a work out, or even really get into a video game. I smoke to relax and it just makes me uncomfortable and the opposite of relaxed. 

I have so many good memories of weed, and I think there was a time that it was a positive force in my life. But not anymore. 

Here’s to day one. Mad love to you all.",6

2019-10-07 12:20:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/delpws/hi_all_first_post_on_reddit_day_17_no_weed/,Hi all. First post on reddit. Day 17 no weed,"Hi y’all as my title says this is my first time posting. I’ve been reading r/leaves the past few days and it’s been giving me strength so thank you all for that.

Today is day 17 of not smoking weed for me. I quit for about a month and a half like 5 years ago but this is the longest I’ve got without weed in a loooong time. Been a daily/multiple times per day smoking for 8 years and am 31 (years old) now. I’m also about 2 months into no alcohol. Weed has always been the more difficult substance for me to quit though. 

I feel I’m at a point in my life where I HAVE to make some changes. My mental and physical health feel like they’ve been going downhill for years and I guess I’ve always used weed as a way to try to not think about my physical health and to numb out and run from my feelings. Weed has also been kind of an anti depressant for me although for awhile now I’ve been thinking maybe it’s contributing to the depression and it’s time to just face the darkness and hard feelings to get through them. 

Anyway yea, day 17. I know deep down I need to quit to be the person I want to be and get healthy and find the root of my pain and problems I’m running from. But this is super hard. I feel isolated because almost all of my “friends “ smoke. My past three days I’ve wanted to smoke but haven’t and I’m afraid I’m going to give in soon even though I know I need to keep going. A few nights ago I would have smoked with a friend but he said the weed he had sucked, so I passed. Two nights ago I text a couple friends I usually smoke with but they didn’t respond. I probably would have smoked if they did. But right now I’m thankful they didn’t and thankful to be on day 17. I want to keep going so that I eventually get to a point where the cravings are less and it’s easier. I know I can’t just smoke once because I’ll fall into smoking everyday again to run from my dark feelings. I know what I need to do is face, integrate, and love those parts of myself. 

If anyone has any tips for pushing through these early days I would much appreciate it. The hard parts are feeling like I don’t have my old friends to hang out with. Feeling temptation to text someone to smoke with and zone out and watch a movie. Feeling isolated. And being strong enough to feel dark feelings and thoughts fully.

It has been helpful to get out in nature, exercise, and meditate. I keep trying to remind myself that on the other side of this addiction/depression/anxiety/pain is a deeper connection with myself. A deeper connection with others. And a deeper connection with nature and spirituality. Which are all things I want more that to get high and feel “good” but numb for like 45 minutes.

2019-10-07 11:31:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/del1hs/i_would_like_to_lose_this_habit/,I would like to lose this habit.,"I'm 52. Up to five years ago I had only tried this stuff twice in my whole life, in social settings. Then a guy I briefly dated gave me a large bag for free. Well past the break-up, I started using it on weekends, each evening - on my own. And then also one or two evenings during the week as well. I noticed that if I had any, I could not stop myself from using it daily. So I gave it to a friend to keep, and we did it when we got together (several evenings per week).

7 months ago I moved to a new city and I've been doing it every evening. I did go without it for about a month, but I'm back to daily. My main reason for quitting is that it fills my time that I might otherwise be using to try to socialize, which is something I totally dislike doing, but feel may be necessary for sanity, as it is for most humans. It's just too easy to feel good with this stuff without having to make myself be uncomfortable and reach out / interact with people, which is how people normally feel good, I imagine.

Another reason for quitting is that I'm concerned that cannabis may cause cognitive deficits, however small - well past the 2 hours of the state of ""intoxication"" one feels. Like into the next few days or weeks. I am in a field, workwise, where this might matter. Specially right now I can't afford that risk. I am starting a new job in a week, and it is my chance to find out (for myself above all) if I have what it takes to do it.

And my third main reason is that I don't like being a slave to a substance. Somehow that doesn't sit right with who I think I am or want to be at least.

I'm hoping that writing on this forum will help me stay off this stuff somehow.

Thanks for reading.",37

I’m a 39 year old male quitting for the 6000th time.  I’ve been using cannabis since I was 19 years old daily all day every day. I know this is the monumental time to really quit because I don’t have many more chances left at the age of almost 40, I need to make this change.  My question is, “after a certain amount of time is there ever a way you could retrain your brain to appreciate it once in a while and fix your addictive personality” or is it mostly all or nothing?   I know this is a subjective question but I think our addictions cross a lot of similarities so I’m wondering how you guys view your day by day,  Some people say it’s one day at a time which is a common mantra or some people say I’ll never smoke again which makes it just more concrete.  

I remember quitting for two months and it was the best feeling I’ve ever had,  I was so much clearer in my brain and I was socially a different person for the better.  I am a musician and audio engineer and I’ve noticed that being stoned really suppresses my art and I really want to get back into it with passion.

After 60 days sober, the longest in my adult life, I fully relapsed.

While I had almost constant access to weed the whole time I was sober (which was actually v important to my effort - quitting because of willpower not access), I didn't smoke one drag, until one fateful night.

I went to a gig with an old friend. We'd known each other from pre-smoking days but since had both got into smoking and psychedelics. We talked about weed and creativity and I kept quiet that I'd quit. That night going home I was drunk and a bit buzzed about the idea of getting high and creative, so I rolled one up from my friends stash and smoked.

60 days sober I thought. One joint won't hurt. 

Well it did. That first smoke sent my head spinning and I couldnt finish the whole thing. Went to bed feeling very sick and somewhat cheated of my cheat high. My tolerance was kaput.

Then comes my second mistake. In the morning, groggy and hungover, there lay the other half of the joint. I figured sure I'll smoke a few puffs and enjoy contemplating the high, then back to sobriety.

I smoked more later that day. And the next day. And the next day. Within about 2 weeks I was up near the same level of tolerance, and smoking every day.

I've not stopped smoking since then (except for an 11 day and 5 day stint). I'm back to square one and the negative effects are slowly coming back. I'm still nowhere near as bad as I was before (my first 60 day stint began from hitting rock bottom), but still smoke almost every day.

I know I need to quit again. I wish I understood why it was so easy to relapse. I honestly thought my brain would have been reset after 60 days, but not even close. 

Looks like I need to quit again, and hold strong this time. I wish i understood why it's so hard to stop getting high. Not sure where to find the strength since high life is manageable right now. 

tl;dr - Smoke after 60 days and you'll probably relapse.",11

I decided to quit smoking on September 20, I relapsed 8 days later and then smoked for 2 days straight. Since then I've recommitted to my sobriety and have one week under my belt.  My withdrawal symptoms before my relapse were mostly manageable but after my relapse I feel into waves of panic and anxiety attacks.  

For those experiencing these issues, don't give those thoughts power. The anxiety acts like Freddy Krueger, when you give it attention, it gets stronger and it tries to hurt you.  When you can feel your body getting anxious, do your best to shift your thoughts. Breathing exercises are great, meditation is wonderful, take a walk or talk to a friend/family member. If you dwell on the anxiety and panic, it will only get worse.  

 I'm still struggling with my symptoms but I can tell you, things will gradually get better.  I still have feelings of anxiety but it's hold on me is less and less each day.  You may have times where you slip into an episode and feel like all is lost, it's not. That's just Freddy trying to get you.  Be strong, be focused on the present. We will get through this.",4

Sorry for the long post but I've had a lot on my mind this past week. I set out with the intention of logging my feelings every month whilst I was going through paws. However, these past 2 months I’ve felt like I’ve been going backwards at times and depression has been making it hard to be motivated to write about how I’m feeling. I wanted to write this to say that I’m definitely not out of the woods yet and probably have a while to go before I can confidently say I’m feeling more like myself.  


Firstly I’ll start with what has improved:  


My “visual glitches” i.e. floaters, visual snow and weird colour distortions is all but gone and I only really see these when I’m looking for them or I’ve just woken up in the morning and I'm only half awake. My brain fog is also a lot better and I recently went back to university after dropping out two years ago and I'm happy to say I’m feeling a lot more motivated in staying on top of work and making it into every lecture. Thought rumination is also almost non-existent as, similar to my brain fog, my head feels so much clearer and I’m not getting distracted by random and racing thoughts.  


However, not everything is better and I have more to improve on:  


DP/DR had been nearly non-existent when over the past few days it came back in a storm and I’ve been feeling completely out of it and unable to connect with my surroundings. This is, in my opinion, the worst symptom of high anxiety caused by paws as at times it can feel really scary and once I start focusing on it my mind starts spiralling into panic as I fear that it is more than just being dissociated and maybe I have something more serious wrong with me. However, once I’ve calmed down and read some success stories with dealing with this I feel a lot better knowing that the road to recovery is long but necessary.  


Exercise and meditation was something I started a few months back but I’ve been feeling extremely unmotivated to even bother trying to continue learning and building these as habits. In my head, I know that these two things will help my recovery immensely and give me a sense of accomplishment as I see my mind and body become more healthy but at times it’s really difficult to find the motivation when I’m feeling so anxious all the time.  


Lastly, depression has been my biggest enemy in the past few months. It’s made me so lazy and uncaring about everything. When I wake up I feel nothing when I hang out with friends I have moments where I can forget how I’m feeling and enjoy the moment but I soon fall back into my head and become quiet and unmotivated to engage in social situations. I’ve been taking antidepressants, Prozac, for 6 months now and although they have helped in some ways I do feel like I want to come off them as they are leaving me numb to any situation I try and put myself in to make me happy. I hope one day I can look back at this point in my life and be grateful I made it through the storm but right now it can be difficult at times to keep focused on that prospect.  


Many people might say “Paws doesn’t affect you that way” or “You shouldn’t feel like this after being off weed for so long” but just like any addictive substance if you take it heavily for so many years without break and it’s suddenly ripped away from you it CAN leave your brain in a weird state and it can take up to 2 years before you’re more comfortable with how you feel. I hope these next few months will be better and I can find the motivation to make the improvements in my life to be healthier.  


If anyone is feeling similar to me and wants someone to talk to I'm always up for a chat as I felt being able to share your worries with someone who understands what it feels like to go through PAWS can help immensely (I know it helped me greatly). I hope whoever is reading this is doing okay, however long you’ve been off weed for, and hopefully we can all make it out of this dark hole and become the people we were meant to be.  
Stay strong, peace!",5

Weaning off gradually?,"I joined Reddit just now for this community, after having had my wake-up call yesterday that it's time to quit. I've been an every day toker - little bowls at night usually, with the occasional big bowl that these last few weeks I seemed to need a lot more often. I quit once before, 3 or so years ago, and then started smoking again after a few months sober. Pretty soon thoughts about quitting started to nag but I resisted those with all my might.

Like I said, I had been smoking more and more in the last few weeks, telling myself I couldn't cope with my sober emotions, just needing a few hours' break from myself, you know the excuses. My non-smoking partner was pretty cool about not putting any pressure on me to quit, but I could see he was getting more worried. Then yesterday happened. No big revelation, no mental beakdown, but I woke up feeling like hell, smoked a bowl to feel better, smoked another because the first one didn't help, took medicinal THC oil to support the bowls, and feeling more emotional all the time. And it just clicked. I need to quit. And if I keep thinking that I need weed to be able to live inside my own head, I REALLY need to quit.

Last time I quit, I quit cold turkey, hardly slept for 2 weeks and had terrible nightmares. Tbh I don't remember much else, so I may have had other symptoms. But the insomnia was the worst, because about 10 years ago I kicked the Ambien habit after having taken that for 10 years and I'm still terrified of insomnia. Can handle panic attacks like a pro but insomnia is my mortal enemy. So I'm thinking... if quitting cold turkey is hell, even though it's just a few weeks of hell, how about weaning off? I don't mean to smoke smaller bowls, I know myself and the bud needs to go. But maybe take a drop of THC oil at night to help the symptoms? On the other hand, there's always the temptation to take more.

To quit cold turkey or to wean off with THC oil, that's the question. How did you quit/are you quitting? If there's anything in the process of quitting that you could have done differently, what would it be?

Thanks so much for your input!

Ever since quitting I've been lonely, all my mates and the people I hung around with are of course by their own choices smokers. I'm surrounded by family that's supporting me in this endeavour of quitting and a few mates online, but none of them have ever been smokers so they don't understand what I'm going through withdrawal wise and it's hard to open up to them about how I feel.

I'm so close to going back but I know I can't. I'm afraid the loneliness might pull me back.

Try imagining you've just smoked up.,"Sweaty palms and feet? Nausea and tingly limbs? Racing heart and thoughts? Feelings of doom and death? Panic attack gripping you tight? Can't stand up without almost passing out? These are my current withdrawal symptoms, but you know what? They're also very reminiscent to the effects of smoking up.

So I've just quit smoking after doing it nightly (small amounts) for 2 years, and boy is it hitting me hard. Insomnia has been terrible, but last night, for some reason, I realised that these feelings were oddly familiar...

Us ex-stoners are actually all equipped with withdrawal-management skills, because when we got too high, we've often recited the usual smoker's mantras: ""It's just the weed. You *can't* die from this. These symptoms are normal and come with the weed. Just buckle up and ride it out man. You'll be fine in 2 hours."" And that's exactly the mindset that could help you through a rough night.

I tried imagining that I had just smoked up last night, and that the withdrawals I was feeling at the time were just symptoms from the weed. And you know what? I found that I was able to *accept* the symptoms rather than resist and fall down the spiral of doom (just recall your self talk when you smoke too much for an idea on how to approach this). 

It's as if having a reason for those feelings helps your mind process them better, rather than being highly-strung and having no explanation to why you feel like Death himself is sleeping right beside you. 

It's like this one time, when I went for a 'Dining in the Dark' thing, and got motion sickness from the total darkness and zero visual input. But once I put on an eyemask, my brain told me that it was normal to not see, and I felt much better after that.

I managed to get few hours of sleep with this method, but it might just be a thing for me, and not for others.

But hey, if it worked for me, it might help one more person, and that's a pretty good deal for me. I'd be pretty stoked if someone said it worked for them too.

Anyway, day 7 here we go.",28

I’ve been a heavy smoker since I was 14 years old. I’m not entirely sure what compelled me to be a smoker that early, but nevertheless I was. I’m 23 now, and I’m just trying to get my life together as I’ve just landed an awesome job.

My whole life I grew up poor so to have this job (relatively high paying) come into my life, to finally end my struggle I should be happy. In reality, I’ve just become numb over all the years of being late on bills, struggling to feed myself and all that shit.. That this seemingly great event barely even registered on my numbed up mind. I was medicating because weed was familiar and calming and reminded me of all the good times smoking when I was younger and didn’t have this burden on my mind. I smoked about a gram a day on average (some days way, way more) because I would grow it myself therefore have access to a shit ton of weed year round. 

Today is a week clean. I really don’t have cravings in the sense that I want to get high, but I do want to smoke just to alleviate this withdrawal. I withdraw hard compared to my friends experiences. I literally can’t hold a thought, and when I do, it spirals into depressed and anxious loops. I can hardly leave my bed and medial tasks at my new job are nearly impossible (luckily my new bosses don’t have the highest expectations of me yet.) This feels like hell, and it’s hard because no one gives a weed smoker the time of day when they talk about their addiction. They should, it’s clear to me that I am an addict. Maybe it’s not as hardcore as other harder drugs but this is real and I guess I’m here to just say I’m with anyone else who’s feeling like me.. We aren’t here alone and now we’re on the mend. 

Does anyone else have hardcore withdrawals that last a long time?? I love weed and I wish I could smoke occasionally but I am truly an all-or-nothing type guy when it comes to the herb. It’s not worth going through this again. I just needed to rant to someone because I don’t think anyone in my life would take this seriously because 1. They are a heavy smoker and haven’t gone through this yet. 2. Have quit and they had hardly any withdrawal at all (my girlfriend) or 3. Never smoked and thinks it’s just silly that someone could withdraw from cannabis. 

Thanks ahead of time, and if you’re going through this too, don’t give in you’re not alone!",3

So many times I've thought about making a ""day 1!"" post here, but it never came to be.

And here I am, struggling to get my brain working again. Yesterday I was so depressed that I was borderline suicidal. It made me realize how chronically depressed I really am, and how much I've used weed to cope. I had a fairly abusive childhood and I worry about the damage that did to my brain. 

Anyway, today I am a little better than I was yesterday, so I wanted to share my ""success"". The cravings suck but I just have to tell myself - I don't want to be high - in fact, getting high right now after a t break would be overwhelming - I just want relief. I just want to be able to distract myself from the emotional turmoil I feel. But even more than that, somehow, I want to be sober. I want a clear head. I want to know who I am without a cloud of intoxication covering part of me up. 

A friend shared a meme on Facebook yesterday that really motivated me. It said: ""If you quit now, you'll end up right back where you first began. And when you first began, you were desperate to be where you are right now. KEEP GOING."" It really helped me push through. The temptation to relapse is strong. But I've worked so hard to get here, even just a couple of weeks out. I don't want to start over. I don't want to go through withdrawals again. I want to get to the point where it's a relief to not be high.

Thanks for listening everyone. I truly know how hard this is. I'm finally in place where I feel like I'm making progress, even if it feels like I'm dragging myself across cement. I just want you to know I know the pain of failing over and over to quit. But, here I am, somehow I've made it this far. It's not easy, but if I can do it, I know you can, too.

I actually stopped smoking about a year prior, after smoking copious amounts of weed on a regular basis for the best part of 10 years. It started to affect me differently and I eventually realised that getting stoned was really fucking with my mental state, and I figured out that what I enjoyed was the thought of getting high more than the actual feeling of being high. Like I'd wake up and look forward to rolling a joint, but then as soon as I got a few lungfulls in I'd instantly regret it and I'd just spiral downwards from there. So I quit.

&#x200B;

But after quitting, I felt bad that after having such a nice, long relationship with Mary Jane that we were parting on bad terms. I hated weed at that point for what it was doing to me, but I knew I shouldn't. One day while clearing out the garage, I stumbled across an 1/8th of some absolute chronic bud that I'd stashed way before. I thought I'd roll up one last joint, make myself comfortable, smoke it, and enjoy it one last time. What a bad idea that turned out to me - for some reason that one just hit me like a thousand tortured souls coming after me and trying to go to sleep that night was one of the most hellish things I've ever been through. It was that night that I realised just how easy it obviously is for people to get caught off guard and end up developing serious mental disorders. I could certainly feel an element of psychosis trying to creep in and it was genuinely terrifying, the stuff that was going through my head that night.

&#x200B;

Anyway, another year rolls by and I'd never smoked since. But the remainder of that 1/8th was still stashed away somewhere. Why I decided to keep it after my last experience, god only knows. So I did the same again, and this time told myself that under no circumstances would I permit myself to go down a bad path. I prepared a nice little happy place on my sofa, lined up some wholesome comedy clips on the youtube playlist on TV, prepared some fresh juice to have at the ready, rolled my joint, put some uplifting music in my headphones, went for a little walk outside down to the fields nearby (in the dead of night). Found a nice wide open spot with a great view of the sky, smoked my joint and got high as a kite, and I mean old school happy high, I felt great. Got home and got settled in to my pre-arranged comfort zone and let Youtube do its thing.

&#x200B;

That was about a year ago and I've never felt a single urge to smoke weed since, even when I've been around my friends who still smoke - it just does absolutely nothing for me anymore. I'm just glad that we were finally able to part ways on good terms!",23

I am looking for insight from people who have struggled with marijuana withdrawals;  I feel like I’m losing my sanity and need help.  

Long story short, I am a 29 year old male with no history of anxiety or depression.  I have been a recreational smoker for 11 years, this previous year I moved to multiple times a day, every day smoker.  I made the decision to quit on September 20.  

TL;DR of withdrawals (day by day below) . I first quit on september 20, first 8 days weren’t that bad but then  I relapsed and smoked 2 days straight. Since my relapse, I have had horrible anxiety and panic episodes along with lucid dreams, lack of appetite and night sweats.  The anxiety and panics seem to be lessening each day but when they hit I feel lost and hopeless.  As of today, I’m experiencing my emotions going all over the place resulting in me sobbing my eyes out.  In spite of me feeling a little less anxious each day, when I do fall into my episodes it feels like it will never end and like I’m going to be stuck like this forever.  

Here are some questions for people that have been through this:

Did my relapse cause my anxiety and panics? 
Did the 2 day relapse binge reset my withdrawal clock?
Is it normal for the anxiety to be so crippling for this long? 
Did I screw up my brain for good?
Any thoughts on what I can do?


Weekly Review - after relapse

Day 1 - Full panic attack at work and extreme anxiety the rest of the day, no appetite. No problems sleeping


Day 2 - Extreme anxiety in the morning with a near panic episode. I was calmer at night and was able to eat a little dinner but my appetite was still very suppressed. I had no issues sleeping and had very lucid dreams. I did wake up twice drenched in sweat.


Day 3 - Another near panic attack in the morning at work and high anxiety the rest of the day. I had no appetite today. Sleeping was very difficult at night.

Day 4 - The morning I had pretty high anxiety but no panic episodes.  I was able to calm down a bit in the afternoon and at night I was almost feeling myself again. 


Day 5 - I felt normal for most of the day, I even felt my appetite come back. I ate a Big Mac for Lunch and it made me feel like I wanted to vomit. Since I wasn’t feeling anxious today, I went to dinner with my wife but then I had a very bad anxiety at the restaurant. The anxiety was so bad, I couldn’t stop shaking and I was not able to eat. Sleep wasn’t great and I woke up twice covered in sweat.


Day 6 - I could feel the anxiety in my chest but It did not come with the racing negative thoughts.  At this point, I’m feeling malnourished and light headed due to lack of appetite this previous week. I was able to force myself to eat some food and then decided to go for a short run to try and get rid of the anxious feeling in my chest. Running helped. By noon, I was feeling like myself again. In the afternoon, my anxiety came back for about 2 hours but then melted away and I felt almost normal again. By the night's end, I was starving and was able to eat some food. I had very lucid dreams tonight and woke up twice covered in sweat. 


Today, Day 7. I woke up this morning feeling a mild anxiety. I was able to eat a full breakfast and went for a walk.  This afternoon, I went to my nieces birthday party and opened up to my family about my marijuana issues and current state of mind and I couldn’t stop crying.  My anxiety hasn’t been a major issue today. Strangely, I was very sensitive to smells at the party and most smells made me feel nauseous.  Eventually, I had to leave the party because all I could feel was self pity. 

Conclusion:

2019-10-06 18:51:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dease9/my_story/,My story,"Woah this turned to something much longer than intended. Sorry. Needed something to do since I can't sleep.

Hi everyone! I'm a 22 years old now. I smoked for the first time when I was 16 with a couple friends. Almost instantly I picked it up as a very occasional pastime with friends and it always had to be a free night, Friday or Saturday. Back then I could hold on to a gram for days or even weeks without having the need to smoke. That type of use was completely fine in my opinion. While it lasted...

At some point at age 17 I started not caring about if there is school the following day and would toke up a few times a week not really caring what day of week it really is. Soon it became almost daily. Still light amounts, maybe 0,3-0,5g a day on the ""heavy"" days and taking a break would not be a problem I'd just rather not do it. Towards the end of the year I was addicted as I see now but didn't really care to stop and  told myself I could stop whenever. I was still excelling in school and sports and nothing on the outside really indicated that anything is wrong (perhaps anything actually wasn't yet).

I finished high school with high (pun not intended) grades and got to a university to study Computer Science. I loved math (and coding, which is math to me but that's another debate lol) and acknowledged that weed has been proven to lower mathematical abilities. I took my education seriously so I quit cold turkey for 7 weeks upon starting university 4 years ago. I was very productive my first year and knocked back a lot of studies despite falling off and starting to smoke again after the 7 weeks.

Then around year two it got heavier. I had moved to my own apartment and nothing could stop me. I'd be ripping 1g of bong every night. My studies slowed down tremendously. Luckily I was somehow able to push forward in a green Haze and pass courses. Weed had become a severe addiction and started a porn addiction on the side. Around then I started assimilating the two together. I wanted to smoke and watch porn every day. This hurt my relationship with my girlfriend of 2 years, as I started having more and more mood swings, lower libido, erectile dysfunction and less motivation in general. My girlfriend did not know what was going on or why. She was fully aware how often I smoke but had no idea about how much. Nor did she know about my porn addiction. 

Porn induced erectile dysfunction (porn that I needed to get high to watch) became a real burden and I kept it a secret. It wasn't limp like a dead fish or anything but I couldn't get that satisfying rock hardness or keep it as easily.

Even with these problems going on I was still relatively sharp minded and social. I was drinking less alcohol than my peers and felt pride over it. I knew I had a problem though and had known for a while. 

I landed a software developer job in the spring at 21 years old and was able to finish my bachelor's studies (with a very under achieving thesis that I worked on a lot while stoned). This ""success"" got me cocky and I was smoking every night more than ever. Sickly amounts.

In the end of that year (2018, last year) I tore my hip (needed surgery) and I broke up with my long term girlfriend (both ways cheating involved). I couldn't do sports and was forced on sick leave for 6 weeks post surgery just mostly alone in my apartment unable to walk with a fresh breakup in the back of my head. This was the nail in my mental coffin during the dark winter days (I'm from Scandinavia, winter is depressing here). Smoking was now easily 1.5g even 2 a day.

Fast forward to now. I have a Viagra prescription for my ED (ED that goes away if I take a few days off from toking and porn). I decided to opt for getting prescribed Viagra as a 23 year old instead of facing my problem (shameful!!). I would never have trouble alone, only with girls. Especially new not-so-familiar girls. 

But the worst thing about what is happening currently is I have lost my sharpness. I have lost my memory. I'm not executing at work nearly as well as I should. I used be able to remember what I read in a textbook after reading it once. Now I might forget what I was talking about mid-sentence. I can't recall very recent events well and feel stupid overall. My brain is in such a constant heavy fog that it has become the norm. This makes me want to avoid people and my social life is taking severe damage.

I had 14 days this summer, felt great and then relapsed and fell right back in the hole. During those 14 days I felt the fog lifting (and the dick hardening) and that's why I got arrogant and failed. It won't happen this time. Day 4 and this one is going to stick! Last few days have been terrible sleep, no appetite, sweating and cold shivering. But I feel great! I'm sober and I'm coming back as a whole person! I can't wait to sober up even more!!

I'm also doing nofap but that isn't this channel's topic nor my main problem. If I don't smoke, I don't even feel like watching porn, so quitting weed is key right now.

I don't expect anyone to finish reading this but if you did, thank you and I hope this can inspire your journey to quit.",3

2019-10-06 18:27:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/deahzr/day_10_of_quitting_some_days_are_good_some_are/,"Day 10 of quitting: Some days are good, some are bad. Today was bad, but keeping at it.","Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/db0ah6/stopped_vaping_carts_daily_now_on_day_3_of/

In my previous post I mentioned that I have been experiencing:

* Intrusive negative thoughts about how nothing in life matters causing me to feel anxiety & depression-like symptoms at times

* Constant feelings of stomach irritation & subsequent loss of appetite

* Feelings of depersonalization & derealization where I feel like I'm watching myself & not believing in the absurdity that I'm a conscious entity within my own body experiencing the world

Over the last week, I have felt better for the most part. I have been meditating almost daily for the intrusive thoughts & derealization, continuing to exercise & take OTC medication for my stomach issues, and just in general been trying to keep myself busy. On most days I am fine, with the occasional negative thought popping into my head that I am getting better & better at dismissing thanks to the meditation I've been doing. I haven't felt any serious cravings to smoke, and have been managing fine.

Unfortunately, today was a day where everything seemed to hit me at once, and nothing seemed to help: My stomach has been acting up all day & I've been to the bathroom at least 5 times already. I've also been feeling very anxious all day, and it seems like a spiral where the stomach irritation makes the anxiety worse which in turn makes my stomach feel even more irritated (like a massive knot). I also feel very large cravings to smoke, because some part of me feels that as soon as I do, all of these horrible symptoms will go away. On top of that, I once again felt the strange feelings of kind of “zooming out” and feeling like the concept of me experiencing my own existence through my consciousness is absurd and doesn’t make any sense to me.

I tried meditating, and while it did help with the feelings of derealization & negative thoughts, it did not do much for my upset stomach. I have been taking pepto-bismol which has been helping a bit, but I still feel like I have this uncomfortable pit in the center of my stomach.

I have been trying to focus on the positive things in my life: I am exercising more, I am setting long-term goals & working towards them, and I am trying to socialize much more than I normally do. I also have been periodically taking hot showers as well.

I am also so thankful for my dad: I can't put into words how much I love him and how much his support has meant to me over the last few weeks. He is an immigrant from the USSR where the attitude towards marijuana is much different than in America, and he was devastated several years ago when he found out I smoked. But never abandoned me and is always ready to help me. He doesn't really fully understand what I'm going through, but has been trying his best to help me and it means the fucking world to me. If I need to just be around him because I don’t want to be alone with my thoughts, he is there for me, and has even been doing reading about anxiety in his spare time.

Tl;dr: Thanks for letting me vent on here; I am determined to continue abstaining from smoking, and really just want to post here to get some more  reassurance that I will feel better eventually.",7

It’s not that I’m not hungry. I can feel my stomach rumbling, but every time I eat, I just feel like throwing up. I’m already a very skinny guy, so the risk of losing weight is actually quite dangerous. 

What tactics have you all used to combat this? It seems like no matter how long I try to quit for (I peaked at 2 weeks) I still feel sick when I eat. I’m now giving it another, final go at sobriety and I would love tips or suggestions to help me learn to eat again without weed.",1

Like the only way to possibly do this is to be put into a medically induced coma and hooked up to a feed bag for 30 days or something, but that would cost 10 million dollars with the cost of medical these days.  


These withdrawls are nothing like what I've seen with Heroin users, not at all.  Instead I feel like a spoiled fucking brat that wants to lash out at everyone because he isn't getting his way.  I feel like a man baby, nobody enjoys the company of a man baby.  My hands feel kind of sweaty, I feel irritable, I want to hit a bowl but I think weed has made me feel more light headed than usual so at least that is helping me a tiny bit to avoid loading a bowl.

I am feeling quite happy with myself, because I have realized something that I didn't understand before. Just quite how bad my mental state is. You aren't supposed to feel tense all the time, at every social get together, thinking of death all the time. It is not a normal state to be in as it turns out. My weed use is so out of control, because I simply do not feel happy, even when I am laughing and watching tv for hours and gorging on fast food. Even when I am high, I am not truly happy, it is only the rush of the THC that dulls my anxiety for a short while. As the tolerance increases I have to have more, just to reach the state of less anxiety, as compared to my normal sober state which is filled with anxiety. It is all subconscious, and was not something I even thought of before.   
It's such a wierd feeling to now know how I truly feel on the inside, deep down where only I exist. There are many things I do that are actually a coping mechanism (such as overeating), that I never thought of before.   


Take care of your mental health people, for some it is the very reason why you started smoking, and why you are having such a really hard time quitting. At least it is for me, which is why I really have to start digging deep to find what is truly making me unhappy, instead of just trying to either hide it in a cloud of smoke, at the bottom of a bottle, or in any other vice I have.   
I now have weekly therapy sessions, that I will continue to go to, and actually do the hard parts of CBT as well, instead of hiding.

Your spirit is crying out for you to fight to be what you were meant to be,"If you are here, it is because you have a thought that marijuana may be negatively affecting your life.

 First things first: marijuana is not the cause of your problems. The cause of your problems is THE SAME THING THAT CAUSED YOU TO BECOME ADDICTED TO IT. 

You may have friends that are positively affected by it. You may see famous successful individuals that smoke marijuana. I'm really sorry to be the one to tell you that you are not like them. You are trapped. You are not trapped by marijuana. You are trapped by your own mentality. If you have ever prevented yourself from becoming the person you wanted to be, I'm talking to you.

Just stop. You are worth it.

I quit 6 months ago. It was difficult and came with months of wrestling with it. But, I will tell you why it was worth it for me. 

I always wanted to do Brazilian jiu jitsu. I did martial arts over 10 years ago and have always been an advocate for it's benefits. I wanted to get back into it but never was able to make it stick. I took the step a week ago and signed up. After my first class, I was excited about it and wanted to go back the next day. The next day was a rainy cold Wednesday. If I was still smoking weed, I would have easily convinced myself not go. But I had nothing else going on. I had absolutely nothing that sounded more fun than going to jiu jitsu class. If I was smoking weed, you bet your ass that getting high and gaming would have sounded like way more fun. The fact that I actually want to go back each day is all the proof I need to know it's working for me.

""I'll start tomorrow"" or next week... Or next month.. or next year. That's easy to say when you're stoned. 

Just stop. Let yourself be bored. Only by being bored will you really gravitate to what you should be doing. 

You are worth it. Give yourself an opportunity to take a step back and get to know yourself. Contemplate.",251

I've been smoking nightly for 6 months and decided to call it quits yesterday. Others are not addicted like me and stopped with me.   


These are the most important people in my life and they will be here for just 10 more days and I feel like I am shooting myself in foot by quitting now. I feel stressed/depressed and I am afraid this will last for the reminder of their time here. Instead of making amazing memories I will just feel depressed.

Now I am starting to realize we had so much fun together smoking at night, laughing... Right now I don't feel social at all, I also have a lot of work related stress which I used to numb with weed and it's now coming back with vengeance...

Work is also my main reason for quitting, I need to catch up so much, quickly(mostly thanks to weed...) or I will face pretty dire consequences. But without weed I am almost too paralyzed to start, I keep overthinking everything.   


There are plenty other reasons, like eating extremely unhealthy, not going to the gym, not brushing my teeth before sleep, not learning anything new, never feeling like actually going out(I just enjoy smoking around friends), expensive weed, drinking alcohol/smoking ciggs when high... It's a horrible thing for me, really.

I made an account just for this, sharing our experience is supposed to help. I'm not looking for any specific help or anything, just want to share. I decided to quit because it was no longer something I enjoyed or did for fun, but just did because it was a habit. I also didn't like how lazy I allowed myself to be while toking.

After a couple days of insomnia, last week was pretty ok. I kept myself busy and had a fun weekend. This week though has been really rough. Since Tuesday I've been having bad anxiety, mostly health-related, brought on by some stomach issues. Thursday night I started having those really vivid dreams, in particular one where I had to disarm a little kid who was playing with a loaded gun. I woke up in the middle of the night covered in sweat and in a bad panic attack, took over an hour to come down from it. Last night was not as bad, but still some anxiety before bed and feelings of hopelessness in the early morning. More vivid dreams, but nothing as bad as the night before.

I went out for a massage today to try and de-stress some. During the first part I was getting distracted by a lot of negative intrusive thoughts. Felt better overall afterwards, so that was a positive. I'm a little nervous about sleep again tonight, hoping I can sleep through the night for once. Tomorrow I'm leaving to go spend the next couple weeks with my family, which I think will help with the immediate anxiety. I'm also thinking of getting a dog. I've thought about it for a while, unrelated to my quest for sobriety, and I could really use the companionship.

Went for two months clean from March until May and apparently it took me four months to get myself to quit again, which started last Monday. So far so good. 

Tonight I went to hang out with friends and play some Magic, which usually involves smoking a crazy amount of weed. This already got me feeling kind of uneasy during the day, because I have quit less than a week ago, but since I haven't seen then in quite some time I decided to go anyway. While I was waiting for my friend somewhere on the way, I got the idea in my head that it wouldn't be a bad idea at all to buy some edibles for the night. Argumentation: I mainly want to quit nicotine (which is a straight up lie)/it'll at least keep my lungs clean/it'll keep me from (possibly) becoming a cranky fiend for the rest of the night while they smoke etc. etc. 

Something in me kinda hesitated and in the couple of minutes I spent waiting I searched 'edibles' on this sub. Three old posts and comments later I was completely off the idea and my resolve was back again. 

Now I'm back home, and knowing that I got through this very triggering night without taking one hit or puff AND without turning into an irritated mess literally could not make me more relieved or happier. I'm very proud of myself and thankful for those old posts. Thanks to this sub I'm confidently looking at day 7 tomorrow!

I feel dried out, disconnected, almost ill. As a result, I'm not craving a THC high, per se.

It's just the way sobriety feels after a long period of smoking that I want to escape. I'm so much more motivated. Working hard comes much easier to me. I'm not thinking about weed all the time. I'm witty again. These are the things I love about sobriety.

However, I'm just filled with all this anxious energy. People have pointed it out to me, too. There's a constant anxious background noise. It has been impossible detect until the other night where I got drunk at a party.

I suddenly felt this burden lifted off me and I could feel exactly what I had been carrying these past few weeks. I don't miss weed. I just miss not feeling this.

What I think I'm coming to terms with is that you can't have it both ways. I think this anxiety is what is giving me my vitality, my drive, even my humor. I suppose it's best to harness this anxiety and find healthy ways to cope.

The road ahead looks bright. But it's gonna be a tough one! Good luck to all of you :)",54

My mind is super motivated to quit but the insomnia and inability to “turn off my brain” are already getting to me. I can’t really work out right now because I broke my toe last week and that’s what really helped me get through withdrawals last time I quit. I bought some sleepytime herbal tea but that had zero affect on me. Also tried kava tea with again no results.

I think my main problem is i used it to help me fall asleep, was the only thing that stopped the multiple trains of thought as i was trying to get there. Now I'm not smoking I'm worried I'm just going to replace it with alcohol, been drinking every night since to ""help"" but i know it doesn't really in the long run because it will just be a replacement, and probably become a bigger life destroyer than weed (high tolerance to alcohol, don't really get hangovers unless its above 20 standard, so very little repercussion physically)

Most of this is a huge blur. A lot has happened in the month of September. I've been seeing a drug counselor for a while who's been a massive help with me trying to figure out why I use weed to escape reality. As the month went on, I had a lot of realizations about my friends, and mostly my relationship. I came to the decision that my relationship isn't healthy as my partner has been a big part in enabling me to use drugs every single day for nearly 2 years (pretty much the whole time we've been together), and the night before my dad passed, we discussed and came to the decision that I would move out asap to make the breakup as easy as possible for both of us. The next morning at 6am, I got a phone call informing me that my dad had passed away. Despite our conversation the previous night, my partner said to me that I could take all the time I need to move out, no pressure. But as this week has gone on its becoming more and more obvious that I need to get out asap, as since the start of this month I have been smoking every night. 

I guess I'm here to ask advice. Since pot has been my no. 1 coping mechanism, I have no idea how I'm going to handle not having my dad around. He died very suddenly, he was in hospital due to some heart issues and we were all expecting him home the next day. A lot of my problem is that I keep worrying about my partner, as I know he has an addiction problem that he is refusing to acknowledge. I keep reminding myself that it's not my job to keep him well, but I also keep feeling horrible for staying as I know hes hurting a lot since we're breaking up. I'm hoping to start moving out tonight, and I have other places to stay, but I dont really want to be anywhere else apart from with my stepmum, where she and my dad were living. I'm trying really hard to keep my shit together but I dont think I can handle being here one more night.

I'd say 2 grams a day? Also would occasionally vape oil. I have had 0 cravings but maybe 1 time because I am absolutely serious about getting my mental health back on track.

The first week was bad with insomnia, anxiety, and stress. It all eased away until september 23rd I started feeling heavy brain fog, anxious thinking, and mild depression. 

Yesterday I had a headache and I slept 14 hours last night! I could have slept more. I woke up today and tried to get active but my head is hurting. I started obsessively reading about paws, anxiety, and other peoples testimonies. Today feels like the worst day. I had an anxiety attack and a bit of crying just over how I felt. I know there is no good at trying to forecast the future but it's so dang easy to think it wont get better.
 Anyone currently feel the same? How the hell do we do this? I can give updates whether good or bad.

Ps.
I  have been through CBT therapy in the past and still go 1 or 2 times a month. I feel like I let my tools go dull. I have been on lexapro 20mg even before the drinking/smoking. I have made the same mistake over and over but hope I have learned this time.",2

a dozen days are over and this time it was easier. 
Probably because I failed so often to quit, that I've experienced every excuse a few times. 
I can not enjoy throwing my life away anymore.

But I did not stop so because of the smoking itself. I have plans for my life and goals to accomplish.
Weed was the easy way to not work on myself. With weed I could disguise my laziness.
I have potential, I now exactly what I want and I have to put a lot of effort in it.
The good part is: If I am in motion I tend to grow easily on my tasks. But every time in the past I relapsesd after too eagerly changing my life while quitting.
So I took my time. Time to give away my utensils. Time to quit my immediate habits.

But now I have to work hard on myself. Harder than ever and while writing this I start to recognize this thought as the only possible option.
I'm not going to ask too much of me, but now changes have to be made.
No more drinking, no casual cigarettes. 
And a lot of learning and training. I am glad that none of my goals are of material nature (a few years ago it looked different) and I am grateful that I am young enough to stir the wheel around.

I knew my first post here would be to motivate myself.
I am committing with this post. To myself and to this supporting community.
I really appreciate it.
Time for change.

But I need to get more off my chest than that. I'm sure many have parents that self medicate with one substance or another; my mother did it with pills and food, and it feels like I've unwittingly learned to do the same except pot took the place of pills for me. Many times I found myself thinking I smoke so I don't have to think too much, I didn't want to think too much, it hurts too much. My thinking caught up, but not before being addicted got a head. I've taken breaks, but they ended. I've tried to quite only to find myself replacing it with alcohol. I found it difficult to weather the storm of intense dreams that surged back, teasing me with desires unfulfilled or frightening me with false realities. That disheartened me from trying to quit for some time after my last relapse. But I still knew I could. I had gone without on trips and when not idle I could manage fine without it. But it never seemed convenient to try, or the desire was burried by something else. The past year and a half much has change and really I'm still reeling from it all. My mother passed. I doubled down on my addiction after that it felt. Soon after I got work in the medical cannabis industry and thought the change could do me good. That helps me access everything I think I need even easier too of course. I'm not sure how much of my real self I've hid over these many months. I think I need to find out. A year later and I quit the job for various reasons, but a small voice in the back of my head tries to speak up, saying that one of those reasons, is that I should quit smoking too. And I want to, but somehow I haven't yet. It's still easier not to break this habit. So now I want to do the harder thing, and I'm nervous and hopeful at the same time, and I'm starting by sharing this with you all.

I had a vacation planned where I knew I wouldn’t be able to get weed but couldn’t fathom putting my safety blanket down before then. So I kick started my sobriety with a vacation which I wholeheartedly believe made this 100000x easier. Distraction was key for me, keeping active and engulfed in a new surrounding I didn’t have time to think about it, knowing it wasn’t even an option undoubtedly helped me too. I know everyone is different but if one person can resonate with this to help them quit, then my sharing this is worth it. 

Since quitting my mind is becoming clear again. It’s funny how don’t really see the haze weed puts on your daily mind until it’s clear again. My social anxiety is probably the lowest it’s been since prepubescent years lol. Ironically thought I needed to smoke to “chill out” and stop overthinking this kind of thing, definitely made things worse in my case. I actually went on a date last night and didn’t feel awkward or constantly stressed on every detail of what to order what to say what to do with my hands etc. These were CONSTANT in my mind before and really why I loathed dating.. now i think I might actually have a crack at it lol

Woke up this morning and read some of tony Robbins “awaken the giant within”, only a chapter in since I have a hard time focusing still.. figure that will get better with more practice. A month ago I would have been three bong loads and a dab in by this time (it’s 11am here on Sat morning) so I am pretty dang proud of my progress so far.

I will say the process has been MUCH harder to stick to since being back because all my roommates and close friends are daily smokers as well but they are supportive which is really all I can ask for. We all
Still hang out regularly, board games are a big thing in my framily so we still get to spend a lot of time together and I don’t feel it’s effected any of those relationships.

Sorry for the long ramble! Thanks for reading through if you did. It’s hard but we got this. Life is to precious to spend another moment in that haze.. favorite quote from my read this morning “Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more.”

Have a beautiful day / afternoon / evening wherever you may be in the world..

2019-10-05 13:19:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ddq5ex/how_addiction_works_in_the_brain/,How addiction works in the brain...,"I posted this as a comment and I got a few private messages saying I should post it to the whole group. Some of us are truly world champions at being so incredibly hard on ourselves, and that can make staying sober even harder. So, maybe this can help a few people realize, your brain is working just fine. It's doing what it was meant to do, and you just need some 'updating' of your knowledge.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The way addiction works in the brain is like this; You know how you drive to the grocery store from your house? You probably don't even need to think about it. It's ingrained there in a neural pathway cause you've just done it so many times and your brain doesn't have to use much energy to do something its done repeatedly.

Now, when you're doing something new that you've never done before.. its like driving to the grocery store from your house .. but across everyone's yards and driveways, knocking down their bushes and trash cans. But after a while, if you kept driving thru everyone's yards it would knock down the bushes, tamp down the grass and pretty soon you'd have a smooth path that you could drive on.

This is how the brain works - we use the well worn neural pathways the most. We are always making new pathways (unless we're down regulating our brains thru drugs, alcohol, stimulants, etc) and paving over old habits that we aren't doing anymore or lost interest in. You can actually see this in MRIs., fascinating stuff.

Now the brain is designed to **seek pleasure, avoid pain and conserve energy (the motivational triad)** . So whatever we seek pleasure in (or any other repetitive behaviors) becomes one of those very well worn pathways and our brains don't have to use much energy for repetitive habits. It's easy to keep going back to the habit your brain knows because it is seeking pleasure and conserving energy to stay alive. A lot of us will say, ""I don't want to keep smoking, why am I doing this?"" Well, this is why.

Your new neural pathways from being sober are going to take a bit of time to get inculcated (let's call this You 2.0) you are literally updating your own operating system now.  Branding yourself an 'addictive personality' is probably a misnomer.

You just have habits. Nothing bad or good. Just habits. Like all the other humans 😊 And soon, you will have new habits.

So, be gentle with yourself and maybe give your brain new things to 'play with.' Brains love goals and working on problems. Start thinking about what you want to accomplish today, this month, next month, next year, five years, etc.

You got his..

A little bit about me: I am a 24 yo f that was smoking pretty much daily since going away to college (4 years). During that time, I've gone through many personal issues that led me to a place of depression, anxiety, weed dependency and constant isolation. I masked up 95% of my true feelings with weed, humor and avoidance. I was using weed as a bandaid for a good 3 years and always thought once I'm out of that environment and back home my life would change but obv that wasn't exactly the case. I've been out of college for a year and a half now and my smoking hasn't changed much other than not smoking 9-5 Monday-Friday while I work, but most days after work and especially weekends were filled with smoking nonstop and wasting time.

&#x200B;

I tried quitting weed \~2 years ago and only made it about 3-4 days before going back. Today, my mental state has definitely improved and I am currently on day 5 which isn't much but it's farther than I made it last time. I feel very differently about quitting now than I did before as there is so much more at stake and my depression/anxiety is a lot more manageable. I know that its vital I sort out my life, think more clearly, better my relationships and face my inner issues rather than avoiding them. It will be hard as fuck and it already is getting there but I know quitting weed is the ONLY way to find true happiness and fulfilment in my life. I want a new and better life rather than smoking all my days away. 

&#x200B;

All that being said, this is my first weekend sober and I know if I make it through this I will feel proud, and I feel confident that I will. Today just started and its already by far the hardest day yet. I FINALLY got sleep but it was like a hibernation sleep lol.. I slept for 12 hours and woke up feeling like I got hit by a truck, everything aches my head hurts but I know this is temporary. The pain of detox after 4 years of constant smoking is still nothing compared to the pain I will inevitably endure if I continue to smoke and waste more years of my life. I've never felt so determined to quit and I am so grateful for this amazing community as well as the ""I am Sober"" app thats been helping me get through this week. Thank you all so much & we're all in this together, fuck weed",5

I've posted here previously, but sadly I'm here yet again. I've been trying to quit for a long time now and everytime I relapse after a maximum of 2 days. 

Last night I was out with my best friend who smokes just as much as me - about 3 joints per day, more if we have enough green. We actually lived together for the past two years but both moved back with our folks due to financial issues. I also want to finish my degree in peace but that's another topic. 

So yeah - last night we went out and picked up 2 grams and decided to go to the bar where I work at so we can smoke and chill. All the weed was on him and because my buddy has something against underwear (right?!) he had the green in his pocket. Well, as you can guess, some cops came while we were waiting for the bus, found the weed and took my friend to jail. I was let go cause I was clean. Now, me and my friend are very close, we've known each other since kindergarten (we are 23 rn) and I'm kinda close with his folks as well. 

When the police took him in at around midnight they told us that he'd be released on the next morning. Heh, we believed them and thought we would get away without his parents finding out and that he would mostly get a slap on the wrist or a mediocre fine. Nothing like that. He is yet to be released and its almost 20 hours since they took him in and I had the ""pleasure"" of explaining the whole deal to his parents as they were worried sick cause he didn't come home. I still dont know what's gonna happen cause in Bulgaria the law treats weed as heroin or coke - you could say class 1 substance as in the US if I'm not mistaking.

So the last 24 hours have been a huge pain in the ass and kind of eye opening. We always knew we could get caught and I'm usually more careful than him but the knife has reached the bone this time. I hope this experience will help me quit for good as I dont want my parents to go through the same hell as his parents right now. Theres a lot more to my personal story and I'd be glad to go into details if someone is interested, but this post is already too long. 

Thanks to anyone who bothered to read the whole wall of text. I look forward to hearing from anyone who has something to say and I'd be more than happy to pen pal with someone whose quitting right now as well. 

I love each and everyone of you guys and hope you stay strong in the face of addiction. 

Peace and love,

2019-10-05 07:56:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ddmajz/day_27_quitting_was_great_now_it_is_not_sudden/,"Day 27 - Quitting was great, now it is not. Sudden cravings.","I’m at day 27 right now after about ten years of smoking, I’m age 26 right now. The last couple of years I have smoked daily. One to three joints on working (or previously: school) days, and about four to six every day on the weekends. Weed always a ‘carrier’ for me in coexistence with other habits. I would smoke and munch on delicious but way too much food, I’d smoke and take crazy long 15 to 18 mile hikes in the middle of the night, I’d smoke and masturbate way too much (yeah sorry TMI), smoke and sleep too much, et cetera. Too much was always the common denominator. 


Of course, this took its toll. I turned into a very anxious and always lightly to severely depressed, tired and apathetic person. Except for the long nightly walks, the other coexisting habits also harmed me. But I always seemed to reason myself out of actually quitting weed. I would hate it if this comes off as humblebragging because I truly understand and sympathize with how a weed addiction can totally disrupt a person's life, but I always was one of those functioning stoners. It always seemed that way at least. I completed law school, landed a dream job after graduation earlier this year, the works. I also always took this misplaced pride in not liking alcohol so it seemed fine to enjoy weed this much. All the psychological harm was terrible of course, but I’ve struggled with that a lot in my life (with weed and before weed) so I was kind of used to it. Also low key doubted if my anxiety and depressed feelings was because of the weed this time. Spoiler alert: it was. 


27 days ago I decided to quit weed. I really still don’t know what happened, but I suddenly disliked it so much and hated the person I became. Another factor was getting cancer earlier this year, that really fucked me up. A bit cliche but it made me realize I didn’t actually want to waste all my time at smoking when I’m just this young. So I threw all my smoking gear away and after the initial withdrawal (dear god those dreams) everything was great, only had cravings one or two times and was never tempted to get some weed at the coffeeshop. So I reacquainted myself with being rested after a good night’s sleep, suddenly having confidence again, performing even better at my job, way less psychological struggles all along the line. It was great. My libido is still extremely lower though, but that’s okay I guess. Saves me lots of time. 


Today the cravings really hit me. Not so much the effect of weed per se, it’s more than that. I miss the hedonistic habits. Indulging in food, porn or doing these long hikes while being totally out of this world high. I know I could try to do it sober, I have, but it isn’t the same at all. The long nightly walks now just feel as just that: a long, tiring, nightly walk. Not this crazy high adventure it always was. Food is still delicious though, but not the same. Libido is gone. This feeds my junky rationalising like: I never tried moderation, I deserve a treat, I perform well when I need to, etc. I don’t give in because I know where it will take me if I smoke again, but damn do I miss it though. Especially in the weekends. I meet up with friends a lot after I stopped so I have something to do when I normally would have smoked, but the craving suddenly itches so much now the shine and sparkles of being sober have weaned off. I just want to be a bit out of it but I don’t like drinking and I don’t want to smoke. Is it bad to want this?


Any tips on dealing with these sudden cravings in this stage of sobriety? Meanwhile I’m going to give in to just one of my previous stoner pleasures: a nap in the middle of the day. Lol. See you guys in a bit. Thanks in advance for any help.",80

I literally NEVER thought I'd be able to go even a day without weed. I'm starting to feel more present and for the first time ever I'm actually saving money. Money used to be impossible for me to save because if I had money, I had weed. Now I'm actually sticking to a budget which means I'm actually paying my bills and not neglecting them and getting high to forget. I'm moving into a new place where the rent is high so that's what prompted my lifestyle change. I have two kids, a decent job (50k) and lived with my mom where I only had to pay about 500 a month. I get so sick when I realize how much money I wasted. I lived practically rent free for years with no savings to show for. A shame.

Nonetheless I feel very optimistic about what I can do. In the last month before quitting i started a budget and gave myself a strict weed budget. I was able to stick to it (well actually I went about $60 over) and literally was able to save the rest of my money. so although I'm on day 5 I feel confident now. and saving money is a big motivater

I've been very moody from the hours of (4pm_10pm) my normal smoking hours, and last night was particularly difficult but I went through the motions in my head (calling my connect, buying a swisher, rolling it up, inhaling it and my usual unhigh only wanting to smoke again feeling, trying to hide the scent, being embarrassed when someone smelled it in my car the next day) and all of that is what prompted me not to. I said to myself nah don't do that. u don't even want to. Buy still I was thinking that I could just smoke once a week but the problem with that is that I would look forward to it all week and that would be my highlight thus not really changing at all. I am a high functioning smoker so my blunt would be the reward of my every day because I did alot, I told myself I deserved it 

for the first time I was able to kiss my bf without trying to make up some reason not to ( to hide the fact I'd been smoking) Anyway long story long lol, I'm starting to see a peak of the light and although my brain says go ahead u deserve it, everyone else does it too.. , I will stay strong and keep coming here.

After a particularly stressful shift I thought ""screw it, what's the worst that can happen?"" so when I got home I had a joint. And another. And another. 

The first 5 minutes were relatively enjoyable before the haze descended, then I began to feel sick and I was incapable of holding a conversation with my brother (he doesn't smoke, never has). I went to bed and fell asleep almost instantly but when I woke up the following day I felt shocking, I had a headache, my throat was drier than George Carlin, I still felt hazy and incredibly sluggish, and it affected my work that night.

Now I'm back to Day 3 and I'm alert again. I keep looking at a picture I have of the baggies I had amassed over a year (£2500 - or $3000 - worth) to reinforce the fact that if I stick with this I'll be able to afford a rather nice holiday abroad next year - something I've never done but always wanted to. I already feel better in myself and I'm honestly looking forward to acquainting myself with a brand new person, the person who has been almost constantly high for the past 10 years unshackled and level-headed. I'm beginning to feel ambitious again, I want this new restaurant to succeed, in a few years I want to take it over and this can only happen once I put this perfidious little plant behind me for good.

Hello Reddit,

I do not know where to begin, but I am desperately trying to quit. I have not had sex or physical intimacy in over six years and I am now in debt up to my eyeballs. I feel like setting up a daily log to track my progress will help. I started smoking weed at age 19, over nine years ago. I became a daily toker six years ago. At first I was just picking up a gram’s worth of weed, which would last me a little over one week. My tolerance began to increase as the months passed, but I never found myself consuming more than an eighths worth of weed in any given week. Soon pipes were replaced with bongs, which were then rendered obsolete by a growing tolerance and an increasing desire to chase those “first few times I got high”. At that point, smoking weed was giving me slight head changes and relaxation, but I wanted to get blitzed just like the old days. I found myself picking up dabs and moonrocks. Furthermore, I would only smoke flower if the method of consumption was through a gravity bong. Eventually, smoking became too expensive of a habit to sustain, especially since I was smoking eighth gram blunts and gravity bong packed with moonrocks. 

This is where things began to spiral out of control for me. I am a college educated individual with a degree and a white collar job that pays over $30. At the time, my credit score was excellent and I had no debt. Nevertheless, a few ill advised decisions under the influence of alcohol and weed to put me into a spiral of debt, mostly consisting of credit card debt. It was at that point two years ago that I decided to quit. I have been trying to quit for the past two years. I thought quitting would be cakewalk; after all, no one experiences withdrawals on marijuana, right? Man, what a naïve perspective. Quitting was terrible: the insomnia, mood swings, lack of motivation, non-existent sex drive, etc. I felt like a decrepit 86 year old man instead of vibrant and high-energy 26 year old. Relief was easy, but at my level of tolerance, it was too expensive. The solution? Pick up some edibles. I had consumed edibles during my weed consumption career but had always had negative experiences with them. This time, things were different. I wanted to experience the novelty of those first few times I got high. You guys know what I am talking about: the trailers, vibrant colors, giggling like an idiot until your sides hurt, being able to taste/hear and distinguish different flavors in food or notes in a song. I went to the dispensary and found my ticket in the form of a 100 milligram gummy. 

That was two years ago. My tolerance began to rapidly accelerate as I began consuming edibles. At first edibles were a blast, but the highs had gotten to a level where I was beginning to “think too much”. I started to ruminate and dwell on my situation. I always had very low self esteem and struggled with the concept of masculinity and what it means to be a man in America. In high school I participated in volunteer work assisting children and the elderly. I was referred to as “the gentle giant that would not hurt a fly”. By the end of my high school career, I was beginning to feel frustrated with my “nice-boy, future husband kind-of vibe”. I wanted to be cool, edgy, a little bit dangerous. I thought consuming copious amounts drugs and alcohol would garner the respect and admiration of my peers. I tried to bury my true self with chemicals because I thought “gee nobody would like that guy, he is a lame dork, a loser, a weirdo”. I just wanted to be normal and accepted by my peers. Little did I know, I was straining my relationships with my friends and family. You would think that if getting high on edibles was so miserable, I would stop. That was not the case. Coming off of edibles was harder than being on them. Sober, I would venture into the darkest places of my mind. Entertaining ideas of suicide. Feeling like a complete failure. Dwelling on my inadequacies with the opposite sex. Ruminating about situations that turned sour and analyzing what I could have done better. I focused on my insecurities and let my body image issues (I have congenital defects, not going into specifics) get the best of me. I managed to quit edibles for two weeks, but a rough stretch at work lead my back down the rabbit hole. I now have to consume over 1,000 milligrams worth of THC to get the level of high I seek. At my peak, I was consuming 2,000 milligrams a day, spending upwards of about $80. I have taken out multiple payday loans to purchase weed. I am constantly late to work and should have been fired months ago, which makes me feel even more like a guilty piece of shit for taking advantage of my boss. I could achieve so much more if I cut out the marijuana. I am getting so SICK of wasting time and betraying the trust of the people I care about. One of my best friends just got married and another one is engaged. I am growing tired of letting time slip away. I am sick of weed. I am livid that I let myself get this way. I am disgusted my debt has skyrocketed to over 80% of my income. It is getting to the point where it is do-or-die for me. I have to quit weed. I am running out of time. I am running out of hope. I “quit” edibles a few days ago only to find myself hitting the booze hard. Drinking before work, drinking during lunch, drinking to alleviate the hangover. I hopped back on the edibles after having suicidal thoughts six IPAs deep a few nights ago. I am in a vicious cycle and I am terrified I am doing irreparable damage to my brain. I oscillate between having dark thoughts and feelings to not having any feelings at all. My short term memory is shot. I feel mentally slower and I am frequently at a loss for words during routine conversations. My train of thought is often derailed and I forget what I am discussing or how the topic was introduced into the conversation. 2,000 milligrams of THC is dementia. I am putting my mind through the meat grinder. Enough is enough. Today is the day I am taking a stand. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

&#x200B;

Starting smoking weed 9 years ago;

Progressed to edibles two years ago;

In 10s of thousands of dollars of debt because of weed and weed related consequences;

Have not been intimate in years;

A shell of my former self;

I now consume over 1,000 milligrams of THC;

Weed is not fun anymore.  My highs consist of me ""thinking"". At this point, I use to feel normal;

Been trying to quit for the past two years, ended up doing high quantities with every relapse;

I am finally taking a stand.",6

My story,"I've( 32 f) been sober from weed for two weeks now and it's hard but I feel so much better that it's motivating me. I had been wanting to quit for almost a year and I had been smoking on and off for probably almost 15 years now. I have dealt with anxiety since childhood and depression along with it. I had this notion always that well weed helps with anxiety, making myself numb and avoiding my feeling would help. More often than not though it would just make me feel more anxious recreating the cycle and causing me to reach for more and more everytime. I thought if i can use it in a different form or different type like indica I'll be fine. But I just felt worse especially now that im a mother everytime i would smoke I just felt shame. I wanted to quit but i just kept going back to it. I just had this block for some reason, where I couldn't stop. About 4 months ago I started working with a therapist who's talking me through my issues as well as teaching me mindfulness techniques. I started practicing the mindfulness everyday doing everyday things, but i continued to smoke. I started to notice that i was completely unable to be mindful and in the present moment when I was high. But still i kept smoking. Then 2 weeks ago i went out on a day date with my husband and we got high. I felt anxious, foggy, ashamed, and out of my body. I said to myself right then ""Isn't this supposed to be fun? Cause im not having any."" Well that was the last day i smoked and i feel so much better. My dreams have come back, i started working on my art again, excersising and i even sleep better. I had a hard day with my son the other day and i was stressed and i really wanted to smoke. I didn't cause i thought will this make this situation any easier? I'm learning to sit with the present moment and deal with my emotions and they just pass. My husband still smokes but he just puts everything away and I don't feel as tempted if i don't see it. Out of sight out of mind. I'm hoping my husband will quit too but I know I can't force him and he's very respectful.",5

2019-10-04 16:22:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ddcxtr/introducing_myself/,Introducing myself,"I've been smoking about 2 eights a week for the past 3 years. I got into it when I met my now girlfriend, 4 years ago. It started with a once every couple of weekend things to this pretty much constant high state or incredibly, incredibly high hungover.  

&#x200B;

I am now 23, my girlfriend does not smoke any more as we have a little baby on the way which we are very very excited for. I am passionate about the line of work that I am in, and I would love to invest more time and energy into becoming better and developing myself as a person. I will not find those things on the couch sitting next to the bong playing video games. Reading is pretty much impossible, and it is something that I miss doing. Reading is a hobby of mine that I can never find the time for because it is very hard to read and remember things when drugs are working against you. I know that I am not at my true peak when I am high, and daily smoking. My mind is much more quick to speak, compliment, and joke when I am sober. When I am high however,  I find myself much more disconnected in conversations , only saying things that will make them go away.

&#x200B;

When I get high I don't really feel high anymore. Chasing the feeling of my first couple of highs is what I would call it. When I am high I over analyze all of my conversations, not being productive and basically being a couch potato. While I am deep in my couch I am thinking of all of the cool and productive activities I could be doing if I was high. To me in my life right now being high is not worth it. It is not worth it and I will stop doing it. I owe it to myself and my family to be the mentor and man that they need in their lives.

Ibuprofen isn't doing anything to help.,"I'm on day 2, and I woke up with a headache that 600mg of ibuprofen has done nothing to help.  I read that headaches are the most common physical symptom of weed withdrawal, so I guess it's so be expected.  Anyone else get these?  If so, how long did they last?

Also wondering if maybe there's a different type of (over the counter) pain medication that works better for these types of headaches.  Ibuprofen usually gets rid of headaches for me, but since this might be a withdrawal symptom I figured the mechanism might be different and might benefit from a different medication.

Any input would be appreciated!",6

It started innocuously enough.  An occasional toke here or there. As time passed, my usage grew and grew to the point where in the last year of college I would get high around noon! 

I got a job after it but burnt out in 6 months, partly because I didn't take even a small break after college but mostly because I kept smoking at the same rate that I was in college.  I used to rush home to smoke and rip bowl after bowl. I left the job in 6 months and started college again, primarily so that I could go back to the student life and get baked in peace.

However once I got to my new uni, I found myself riddled with anxiety and found it extremely difficult to make new friends.  Even those who I did talk to,  I felt like there was a disconnect, primarily because the only way I was ever comfortable socialising was when I was getting high with sometime. During this time I quit and relapsed dozens of times. 

I used to kid myself that weed is only enhancing my life. And to be fair,  I was a functional stoner who appeared to have his shit together.  I was a post grad student studying in a somewhat prestigious university and was getting respectable grades.  

However, I now know that weed was like a warm security blanket that I used to pull over my head to avoid thinking about things.  It was something that held me back from achieving what I wanted and made me happy to settle.  Be it professionally,  socially, academically.  I was happy to settle and choose the path of least resistance. I deserve more than being simply functional. I want to live and truly feel alive. Not have the joy from each moment sapped out because the only thing that truly makes me feel happy is being stoned.  Heck, even feeling emotions is a new feeling for me after being numb for so many years.  

I know I haven't experienced sobriety for very long so there is a lot that is still very new to me.  But the following are some tips that I can offer to help sobriety more attainable:

1. The first three weeks are the hardest. If you persevere through them,  the rest is cake.

2. What you want to do is surround yourself with friends and family during this time especially.  This is made harder by the fact that you will probably experience terrible mood swings and will be feeling quite low. If you can, give your friends advance warning of this fact. 

3. This might sound preachy but quit alcohol at the same time,  at least initially.  In my opinion, alcohol is worse than weed and it is easy to substitute weed with alcohol because alcohol acts as a social lubricant and makes you feel great.  However, in my opinion it is worse for your health and more importantly, it lowers your inhibitions which makes relapsing much easier.  It also made me crave weed.  

4. This will be controversial but I found having weed available to me at all times but completely stashed away and out of sight was very helpful.  Since I knew that I had enough weed to last me over a week on hand, the reptile part of my brain that urged me to contact my dealer was silent.  

5. Join classes and try to socialise.  Pick a 5-6 week class and stick to it. Any class that stimulates you mentally or physically would be perfect. I tried a fitness class,  sign language and dancing.  

6. Physical exercise is great if you can do it.  I've taken up biking a lot more but I would suggest not stressing about physical exercise too much in the beginning.  Its great if you can do it but it if not mandatory in the beginning. 

I would like to leave you with one thought that my friend told me that I found very intriguing.  Life is like a hallucination, you just need to get out there and experience it.

I've just lost a ton of money and don't feel sorry for myself because I feel like this is karma's way of telling me, ""Stop being such a selfish, destructive lunatic asshole or this will be the rest of your life and you will deserve it!"" I feel like this is payback for all the money I've wasted getting high. God, I've spent easily $100,000 to $200,000 just on marijuana alone and never felt bad about it because I remained stoned all the fucking time. 

&#x200B;

What's pathetic is there is still a part of me that will always wish I could learn to use marijuana in moderation like normal people do and not have it be my whole life. What an absolute joke that bullshit is because marijuana has been my whole universe from 20 to 29 and I let it a ball and chain me in a comfortable, euphoric prison for too many years. I feel like I've lost all my social skills, and my money management abilities are tragic because I spend more than I earn.  I don't blame marijuana for anything or ruining my life, used responsibly it's great! I blame myself for being such a self-absorbed delusional self-destructive twat who only cared about himself and getting high, and I NEVER want to be this kind of horrible person ever again. I have finally come to accept that for most addicts one is too many, a thousand never enough. For me, one is never enough, one million is never enough and neither is a billion. I don't think there is anyone in the world who hates themselves as much as I do right now. I let everything else I cared about fall by the wayside all for artificial happiness and now I'm paying the deserved price. I loved weed so much I became comfortable, even ""happy"" to lie through my teeth to my beloved family who has stuck with me through thick and thin just to get stoned. I cut myself off from all my friends and forgot my hobbies because my hobby was pot, front, and center.

&#x200B;

I loved weed so much that I forget myself. I loved weed so much I forgot my morals and principles and now I feel naked and broken. And I deserve it for the self-indulgent and selfish way I've treated my loved ones for FAR too long. They deserve a man who is present, healthy, empathetic, creative, and helps others and himself. I will become that man again and never let go because now I finally see through the stoner delusion. Drugs are great used temperately but I am incapable of this and that won't change with five decades clean and sober for me. I know it. What's even sadder is I always knew I had an addictive personality but for a period I took pride in being a drug addict as if it were some perverse badge of honor to be always loaded and a non-conformist. I realize today that non-conformity is wonderful, but you don't need drugs to be rebellious or do things differently then square people. What I believed was my identity was nothing but a big FAT LIE, a destructive lie that took everything I cared about away from me, and made me feel so euphoric that I didn't care that I was wasting both my potential and my life. This ends now! I won't rest until I can look in the mirror, and know I'm the real Simon Stravitz again, not a selfish drugged out zombie who only cares about getting loaded. That was never me, but I forgot myself. NEVER AGAIN.",28

I suffered from anxiety and depression, but it got very bad after i had kids. I started therapy and meds(Zoloft), and they saved my life. I started smoking pot around the same time I started the Zoloft. The Zoloft made my tolerance for my occasional glass of wine pretty bad. I would just instantly feel queasy, and wake up with a bad headache. So I switched to the good ‘ol green. Fast forward to a year later, I was considering taking a tolerance break, because I was having to smoke quite a bit to even get a little buzzed. But day 3, my withdrawal symptoms are so irritating, I’m considering just tapering to curb the discomfort. I also am considering after my break, to only smoke at night/ or just weekends. 
My withdrawal symptoms:

SO SWEATY!!!!
super uncomfortable being cold 
Chills
Issues sleeping
ANXIETY!!
no appetite (it is so hard for me to eat, but I learned the hard way yesterday, because I ended up barfing a few times from vitamins and meds on an empty tummy)

The anxiety is what makes me the most uncomfortable, and if I could just taper I would be better with that! HELPPPPPP",1
2019-10-04 11:07:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dd8m81/quitting_success_and_temptation/,"Quitting, success and temptation","First, a short essay about my life and my relationship with weed.

I smoked daily from around 18-20, and by the end of it I was pretty unhappy with how I was feeling and behaving. I was able to get my shit together, and did well in college for the next 5 years. However, around 25 I lost my girlfriend of 4 years (we aren't on bad terms, but we aren't together), lost interest in school, started playing a lot of video games, and started smoking pot again. My mental health declined, and getting high or drunk and staring at a screen became a daily thing. It has been hard to say one thing caused another, it all just sort of happened at the same time. 

All of that began in my last semester of school. I was able to finish and I was accepted to grad school, but I deferred for a year with no real intention of returning. I didn't really do anything during that year except let myself be miserable. I went to therapy for a while, and it helped me feel better but it I wasn’t ready to let go of my vices. I quit smoking a few times, but I always slipped back into it. Eventually, I was able to muster the courage to go back to grad school, even though I was terrified and had no real interest in doing so.

The last thing I did before I went back to grad school was leave my gaming computer with my brother. Taking video games out of the equation made quitting smoking a million times easier. School started recently, and I have been biking there almost every day. I have been meeting grad students and checking out clubs and organizations. I have been learning about the kinds of things that I used to get excited to learn about. I am finally starting to feel good again. I feel I retrieved that feeling I used to have of wanting to learn. Of wanting to meet people and make friends. I used to tell my therapist, “I *want* to want to do these things, but right now I don’t.” Well, now I do want to do those things.

\~\~\~

I am not writing this on r/leaves with a X months clean message. On the contrary, even though I ‘quit’ it has been hard to stay away from weed.

One of my house-mates has a vape pen, and I have started smoking it a bit. I haven’t been smoking much; only at night, only once or twice a week for the last couple weeks. But the past 2 nights I smoked back to back, and I smoked a couple of nights before that. I know that this isn’t a road I want to start back down, but I also keep wanting to rationalize smoking again. It is like I recognize that I am feeling better and because I feel good and I'm not smoking to keep reality at bay, it is okay for me to start smoking again. But quitting is what has enabled me to get back on a path toward fulfillment, and I don't know that I can be fulfilled doing what I am doing and also smoke. 

Anyways, I guess I just wanted to share my story and the temptations I am dealing with. Stay strong, stay positive y'all.

tl;dr: I recently quit after a period of abuse, and now I’m being tempted back into use.",3

And yet I STILL thought I can do it like a “normal person” one day. I had that thought this morning. Insanity. Powerless. 

Tell me why I cannot do it again. Please, I need reminders from other people. Would help to hear stories from your own life too...

2019-10-04 09:51:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dd7n9q/you_can_do_it/,You can do it!,"Hoo boy...

I was smoking heavily (1.5g/day) for the last 15 years, and finally stopped two months ago. 

I will tell you now, the hardest part was the first week; day 2 of sobriety I *wanted* to smoke, and damn it was hard to say no. I fought that guy hard, but I made it through and went from two days to three, then five, then a week, two weeks, and so on. I get occasional twinges of “I really wanna smoke”, but I look at what I’m doing now and I look at how much money I’m saving, and I’m never going back. Even if the entire world legalized it tomorrow, I’d stay sober; being high just isn’t worth it. 

Fun? Absolutely. But lots of stuff is fun. Hanging out with your friends is fun. Pursuing hobbies is fun. Learning new things is fun. Spending time with your family is fun*. Knowing that I could pass any sort of drug test without jumping through hoops is liberating, and the freedom to pursue whatever I want to do is really fun.

If you’re trying to quit, I want you to know that it can be done. You can leave it all behind and free yourself, and if I can offer my support as someone who has been there, you got it. If you’re struggling with it, I know how hard it is, but I know that you’re strong enough to make it through. Quitting will immeasurably improve your quality and enjoyment of life in the long run, even if you struggle with it at first, and I know that you can make it.

2019-10-04 09:37:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dd7h7o/weed_is_for_the_comfortable/,Weed is for the comfortable,"Title says it all. I Have been struggling to quit this for months. I am on day 3 and I have found new meaning. Weed is for those who are not interested in expanding their horizons. Why read when I can get high? Why worry when I can get high? Why work out when I can get high? Why go for a better job or take another course when I can get high? Why push myself to be a better human when I can take comfort in distracting myself through being high. For those who have made it to their peak and think that the work is done, the truth is you are settling. Life is a long and strenuous endeavour where humans are tested daily emotionally, spiritually and physically. Why seek out emotional comfort when you can channel your emotions to push towards bettering yourself, your relationships and your life overall? Is that not what the human experience is all about? Who on their death bed reveals that they wish they had been more comfortable in life? 

Comfort is like a trap door presented to the weak of mind and spirit. You think you are heading the right direction because it ""feels good"" until you are left in a pit of despair because by giving in to comfort, you have sacrificed what you COULD become for what you are now and this to me, is spiritual suicide. 

Onward and upward,

Getting a new car and moving to a new apartment, a thought that killed me before stopping and now I'm actually excited for it! (had my Suzuki 97\` for almost 3 years and fixing it at least every other month, just couldn't imagine changing a thing in my life)

I have a slight issue when I talk to people I tend to get anxious when the conversation about to end and its very hard to me to just say ""alright goodbye"" or ""gotta go""

Can't explain why but its much better than avoiding conversations all together like I used to do!

First off, yes, I'm still proud of keeping a clear head and taming the weed beast. However, I've been almost unable to accomplish my other goals and it's been very depressing and anxiety inducing. 

I'm self-employed in a competitive market so it's totally on me to get up in the morning and make it happen. My partner and I are in a new city so I don't know that many people which has made things lonelier too. I've been in this lame-ass routine where I have the house to myself starting at 10am. I drink coffee and go through the email/text/facebook/reddit/youtube/endless internet ritual EVERYDAY. I swear I spend 2 hours on it and I'm just starting my day by noon and by that point I'm ashamed and just feeling shitty. But somehow it ALWAYS feels justified. Like, ""well, I have to check my emails. Oh, let's see if that person replied to my facebook message."" Oh and if I'm honest, it always leads to porn and jerkin' off. It's crazy how much time I can lose to that. 

Outside of letting my dreams take a back seat to laying around on the couch ""entertaining"" myself with internet, I've slacked hard on exercise and diet and I'm currently the heaviest I've ever been. Fortunately I have a decent metabolism so it's not terrible but I've been wanting to lose 25 lbs all year. I keep getting motivated for a few days or a week and then I totally fall back into comfort eating. It's a real crutch for me. I can feel myself looking forward to a big junkfood meal with that same druggie ""this will bring me pleasure"" brain as weed. Stuffing myself with comfort food also kinda puts me in a bubble where I don't think about life for 20 minutes or whatever.

Just want to thank everyone in this community for the inspiration, and also to vent a little bit and perhaps offer a slightly different perspective. 

I'm 23, and I've been a daily smoker since about 16 or 17. At first, like almost everyone here, there were no obvious side effects. I have been fortunate to not have any serious failures or terrible experiences due to my usage, but in a way I think that might have been worse for me in the long run because things seemed so fine. From the outside looking in, I might be one of the last people you'd expect to be a daily user. I graduated college, finished an M.A. in Economics a semester early, and I've been working in a great job as an analyst for the past 6 months -- and I've been high pretty much the whole time. 

There was always a part of me that drew some dark pleasure from knowing that I was accomplishing these things while smoking weed. Like I had this big secret and I was superhuman for being able to manage my education and profession while getting stoned daily. It hasn't been until very recently that I've realized how naive I was and how much I've actually missed out on. 

I've always been proud of my cognitive ability. Even without smoking, I struggle pretty hard with laziness every day but I was always able to do well in school/work/etc. without trying hard at all. Maybe this is why I've been able to smoke this heavy appearing as if I had it together the whole time, maybe I've been conditioned for it. 

Anyways, my whole point is that I have recently realized how much being high throughout those experiences has debilitated me, especially cognitively. I took incredibly interesting and engaging classes in school that I can barely remember a word of. I have done pretty well but I've never had any drive to go the extra mile at work or in school. Worst of all, my brain just feels slow and that hurts because it's something I've typically taken pride in. I hate that I've already *had* all of these great opportunities and it feels like I've squandered them. I hope to one day reach a point where I can use in moderation (which honestly is something I've never seriously attempted), but for now I'm 100% done with cannabis. Hopefully some of my experiences will return when I clear up, but all that I'm worried about right now is clearing my head and trying my ass off at work. 

TLDR: Things can seem great for a looooong time, but the weight of realizing how much better you could be as a person can crush you when it finally comes. 

All you can do after wasted time is learn and move on. Keep those spirits up, former stoners!",20

I’ve been sober for 6 months now (so crazy, I can’t believe it) and I’m super happy about it as my life has gotten so much better. This is my first time getting any legitimate sober/clean time. Sometimes I do have the craving for a joint (especially at night or when I’m chilling at home). One of the things that stops me is that I know if I were to smoke, it would be fun for the moment but I would get a weed hangover afterwards. In other words, I would feel groggy after the high wore off. It’s been so long since I’ve smoked though that I can’t remember how long I would feel groggy for. I’m assuming it would be a few days, but I’m not sure. Has anyone ever gotten clean for awhile and then returned to smoking? What was it like? (Ps don’t worry, I’m not considering smoking at all. But I guess I’d just like to hear some cautionary tales from folks). Thanks!",3

2019-10-03 17:58:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dcxxqy/what_worked_for_me/,What worked for me,"Apologies in advance for long post. TLDR at bottom

&#x200B;

It's been 5 days since last smoking (although that was a one off joint with a friend after having stopped for 3) after a good year of trying and one of the biggest contributors was getting a journal and writing a list of reasons why i want to stop.

After that i'd write down how many days it had been since writing the list, how much i'd smoked and a message to myself urging me forward each day. Got to around day 20 before i started to realize enough was enough.

While it's still been a relatively short time since actually stopping i'm confident i'll be able to keep it going and i've gone from constant urges throughout the day to getting them around 4 in the afternoon (always seems to be around then and i couldn't tell you why) which normally passes within half hour and is perfectly manageable.  The tiredness from interrupted nights sleep isn't really any worse than how i'd feel normally after a heavy night of smoking except now the first thing i want to do in the morning isn't smoke again to keep the high going

Additionally i tapered myself down over the 20 days it took me from around 2-3g a day to 0.5g setting myself allotted smoking times that got shorter and shorter. This didn't really work that great in all honesty as i found myself smoking more in those time periods rather than spreading it out through the day but i think the mental aspects of forcing myself to a schedule played a part.

Before this the longest i'd gone without a smoke over the year of actively trying to quit was a day after having a wisdom tooth out and now I can proudly i've even turned down a few free joints from friends while they've all been smoking.

Obviously whats working for me won't work for everyone and i think a try everything ""throw shit till it sticks"" approach is the best way to go.

it might take a year or a hundred attempts but the real key is to just keep at it and realize that just because you've failed to stop this time doesn't mean you won't be able to stop.

TLDR: Keep a physical count of how many days it's been. Try everything until something works. You can do it.",3

I smoked heavily for 4 years, but was able to use occasionally the 5th year since I didn’t like it anymore. I was on an intense anti-psychotic medicine (went into psychosis 3 or 4 times from my weed use) that blocked the receptors so it had no effect on me. I was mad at the time but now I’m really thankful, because I wouldn’t have been able to quit otherwise. At the end, weed just made me feel super dull and I noticed the negative effects more. What really pushed me to quit was when my parents gave me an ultimatum to quit or get out. It shouldn’t have taken that, there were already so many consequences before like failing in college, long periods of unemployment, and the terrible mental health like I said. But I was in denial that I had a problem and always said “Well, it’s just weed.” 

Anyway, it’s amazing how far I’ve come. I go to school almost full time and work part time now. And actually am a hard worker at my job now, and am making good grades for once. I go to NA meetings regularly and work with a sponsor, and just finished the first part of my fourth step (which was super draining during, but at the end I felt lighter). I’m finally starting to forgive myself for all the bridges I burned, because without that happening I would still be out there using. If you’re having trouble, I HIGHLY recommend NA or MA. It’s been a god-send for me, and I couldn’t have stayed clean without it. I still fall into isolation sometimes, but I have real friends now that actually care about me and my well-being. My depression and anxiety are so much easier to deal with now as well. I finally feel like I can cope, and that I’m healing. Putting a substance on top of it made it infinitely worse. 

If you’re at the beginning please push through! It gets so much better and the fog finally goes away after a month or two. You’re gonna feel so much more motivated and alert. There are so many benefits and after a while you won’t even want to smoke. It’s not too late to turn your life around! Feel free to message me if you’re struggling, I know how hard it is. Weed was my best friend, but it was a super toxic relationship. I’m thankful for the positive experiences I had, but weed no longer serves me. Life opens up when you stop smoking, and it really is worth it. ♥️",3

I quit smoking to pass the drug test, and realize there was no real point in trying to smoke after learning a bit about the job.

I let them know that I've had a few seizures over the last 10 years, which I've never disclosed to most people even my family, and the physical is pulled to an immediate stop and I'm told to get a neurologists release. I find out about 3 hours later through an email that my employer said I cannot return without a medical release from a neurologist. Given I'm technically in between jobs I have no insurance. I find out that a neurologist visit for a new patient in my area will be $450 just for the visit itself. I've come to the conclusion I need to find new work, which is very troublesome. I wasn't exactly happy with the 468 hours I worked over an 8-week period at this job, that pretty much told go fuck myself. Maybe I shouldn't have said anything, but I figured if they want to know everything about my medical history back to eye surgery I had in 97 that I don't really know anything about because I was so young , I should mention the seizures. So I hit my brother up today to see if he could decide me a gram any compensation for an old bong that I didn't use any more to give to him for it.

Being sobre for overall 9 months in the last year greatly helped me in realizing how great life is without smoking.   So i can't wait for the first couple of days of being over. 

Every minute you stay away from that shit counts. Your body will eventually remeber how life works without intoxication.

Keep pushing guys. Every minute counts. I belive in you. And thank you guys for all your posts. I am very active here during the times i quit. Lots of love and support from germany.",7
2019-10-03 11:38:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dcslde/halp_its_time/,Halp - It’s time.,"Hi all. I’m finally ready to quit, but I have SO MANY FEELS. I’m terrified of losing the familiarity and ritual of smoking, and I’ve also felt a huge amount of shame for letting weed become a problem in the first place - I’m a high-achieving, fiercely independent woman in my late 20s, and virtually no one has any clue of how long I’ve been smoking, how much I’ve been smoking, and how much of a problem it’s become. I’ve been too scared to reach out to professionals or people who care about me because of the shame, a bit of denial, and anxiety of what a sober life will look like. 

I smoked pot occasionally throughout university, but it turned into a daily habit when I was in the middle of a pretty terrible depressive episode during grad school. I lost access to my dealer soon after moving for a new job after graduation, and I ended up developing a drinking problem for a little over a year because I just could not find a weed hook-up in the small town I moved to and I was just so desperate to get the hell out of my own anxious head. 

It’s been more than 3 years since the end of grad school, and even though I’ve moved to a big city I love, my weed problems (unsurprisingly) followed me here. It’s been another full year of smoking up on a daily basis. I’ve promised myself I’d quit over and over, but once my stash would get low I’d inevitably panic and buy more, and nothing would change. I’m at a breaking point now where my memory is shot, I can’t focus at work, I rush home every day so I can wind down with a bowl (or five), I’m too anxious and apathetic to socialize or date, and I just can’t go on like this anymore. 

I guess my biggest problem right now is the “how” of quitting. What am I going to replace weed with? How the hell am I going to get through the cravings? What do I do when I’m triggered out in public since weed is legalized where I am? Am I the only one whose weed issue is an almost total secret?

Thank you all for the space to get all this out, any and all thoughts are appreciated.",8

From days 5 to 10, I have been periodically wrestling with deep despair. The sense that I am doomed, less than, and a piece of garbage arises strongly and often. 

I am working at letting them pass. Like watching a storm go by. I don’t need to agree or be a victim to the thoughts and feelings. I just need to face them, feel them out, and let them go. It’s scary because they arise and fade over and over. Sometimes, I forget and buy-in to them—perceptions get very dark then.

Physical exercise and focus on tasks helps. My fiancée is clearly happier as I am present for each moment and I can care for her much better (she’s in her second trimester). 

Meditation is also helpful, but I’ve been inconsistent in practice.

All of this has helped me realize:
1. I was running away from difficult feelings/situations
2. I have a mountain of financial rebuilding to do
3. Faith in myself and my ability to do this are key to success
4. I have made the right choice in quitting",10

More than 8 years daily smoking here btw.

You need to get out of your comfort zone period. Sign up for things like a fitness program or something involving other people.  Signing up for a gym leaves you with no accountability but yourself. But if you're with other people and you know some of them you're gonna be a little more motivated to go.

Also try and wake up early. Sleeping is hellish but ive noticed waking up and getting active helped so much.

When I come up with more tips and benefits I'll be posting here. Everyone good luck!",6

2019-10-03 09:30:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dcqxex/i_quit_because_i_felt_like_it_was_making_my/,I quit because I felt like it was making my depression and anxiety worse. Now I'm so much more depressed and anxious.,"Background: I never even touched weed until my mid/late 20s after having major surgery. I picked it up to deal with the pain (being in a medical state) without the risk of getting addicted to opiates. That was a little over eight years ago, and I've smoked on and off ever since, sometimes with breaks up to a year and a half or two years. I started smoking again at the beginning of last year, again to deal with pain, and quit five days ago.

I have 20+ year history of anxiety and depression, and antidepressants have only ever made me slightly better. When I first start smoking, it's great - my anxiety is lowered, I'm happier, I'm more relaxed, etc. However, like many of us, there is no moderation for me. I go from ""I'll just have a little bit on weekends"" to smoking/vaping every single day from the time I get off work till the time I go to bed within days. I know from my own history that after a while I hit a tipping point and it starts making everything worse. When I'm not high, I'm anxious, fatigued, have trouble focusing, am incredibly depressed, and isolate myself from other people. It even gets to a point where I don't enjoy being high anymore - it's just something to do to pass the time and distract me from how sad I am (and I even had one episode a few years ago where I had the worst panic attack of my life while high and was convinced I was going to die - it took me over a year to recover from that).

So that's a lot of backstory, and if you made it this far, I appreciate it. I'm not sure what I'm hoping for, to be honest. I think I just want to know if other people have experienced this massive increase in anxiety and depression after quitting and be reassured that it gets better (and knowing how long the ""it gets better"" takes would be helpful too). I've spent my entire week crying and I'm feeling so hopeless. I'm not going to relapse and I'm not going to kill myself (and I'm on medication and seeing a therapist weekly), but it's a really unpleasant place to be and I'm really scared that it's not going to improve and this is just how I am now. I've apparently blocked out all my other quitting experiences (or smoked them away), because I can't recall if I felt this way previously. I'm less fatigued, which is great, but I keep finding myself wondering why I'm bothering if I'm still going to be this anxious and sad, because at least the weed let me get away from my own mind for a while.

Can anyone provide some hope? Because my hope tank is empty.",14

  transforming it? Can any vital process take place without

  something being changed?

  Can't you see? It's just the same with you-- and just as vital to nature""

Anyways was an avid joint/bowl smoker from 15-30, picked up cigarettes along the way. Quit cigarettes and dipped for awhile, quit the dip. Cut back my caffeine use, increased my water, changed my diet, increased my exercise (yoga, mediation, cardio/dancing).   


Still super unfulfilled, suicidal, and now through 3 jobs in 2 years. I know what needs to change and I've been lying to myself and my wife...Time to step up and quit for good.  


Biggest goal is to make it to Feburary and see my buds (most of them smoke still) for a ski trip and hopefully not ruin all my progress. I don't want to say I can moderate, cuz I know I've never been able to moderate anything in my life.

I've been a consistent daily smoker for about 10 years now. I started smoking weed when I was about 15 years old and loved the effects from the first moment on. Growing up in Austria it was pretty hard to source weed so it was a gradual increase in use largely due to the lack of suppliers our area. That being said, the older we got the better we got at sourcing it. My entire social network revolved around weed. Despite being self-proclaimed proud stoners however, smoking weed was never the primary activity. As avid amateur athletes, we would go freestyle skiing, climbing, slack-lining etc. and weed was just a byproduct or a bonus if you like. 

When I was 18 I moved to the UK for schooling and university. Despite being a stoner for 3 years I vividly remember the first time I was exposed to skunk weed. Damn that shit stank and boy did it get me high. I was immediately under the impression that this was ""the real stuff"" and I had just been smoking crap up until then. Having moved to a new country and school I found weed to be super helpful when making new connections and friends. I continued to smoke weed (skunk) pretty much daily. 

I recently turned 25 years old and on the night of my birthday I realised it was the most unhappy I had been on any other birthday. Despite running my own business and just completing a MA something felt wrong and it was impossible to shake the feeling. At 25 we are supposed to be at our happiest. Thriving and really experiencing life in all its glory, but here I was, slowly isolating myself more and more and living the life of a hermit. It is important to mention that smoking weed didn't and doesn't  make me happy anymore. It is just a way to dampen those doubts in my head. After educating myself more I came to realise that skunk was more of a problem than weed itself. I could see the affects in my face, dark circles under my eyes and also on an emotional level. Nothing really excites me, passion has disappeared and keeping up social relationships just seems like a pain in my ass. It's harder to connect with people. Don't even get me started on my sex life. After having an internal identity / life crisis it forced me to look at myself and my actions objectively. This wasn't me. This isn't me. This was the core of my frustration, something I loved so dearly had made me into something I'm not and don't want to be. Having read ""extreme ownership"" by Jocko Willink it became clear to me that I AM solely in charge of my life. I'm not just a passenger, an obedient disciple or a slave to my own habits. 

With the increase of information on skunk and mental health issues, I increasingly became paranoid about loosing my way and slipping into a serious depression. After having stopped only a few times over the last 10 years I feel as though it is just time to say goodbye to if forever. I keep on thinking, when I'm 35 and someone interviewed me (if ever) I want to be able to say ""I was 25 and knew I had to change my life and so I...""   


Surrounding is detrimental to my success and so is physical exercise and meditation but most importantly; realising and addressing the fact that I have a problem. So this what I'm doing. Addressing it. Rather than sparking up and hiding from my demons. My goal is to buy my last quarter this week, say my goodbyes and start a new chapter. Any tips or advice on longer-term abstinence would be hugely appreciated. Putting this out there is step 1 and I hope it is relevant to someone else out there thinking about quitting. Hit me up if so. Maybe we can kick the habit together. 

Peace and Love.",8

2019-10-02 14:00:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dcdutv/cutting_the_weeds_out_of_your_life/,Cutting the weeds out of your life,"So, about a month ago I embarked my journey with you guys and I couldn't have done it without you guys. The amount of posts here validating the symmetry of my journey through every day is impeccable. This was my first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d0to5r/day_5_rolled_a_joint_at_work_party/) and another [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d3o2tg/alcohol_is_the_real_gateway_drug/) if you guys want to check it out.

I have been trying to cut this out of my life since the beginning of year 2019 and have only been able to do it for one month at a time before I got sucked back in. This time, when I decided to call it quits, I also decided to cut the people off my life that were bringing me back in every time.

A little backstory here, I have been smoking with my room-mate and his girlfriend (who are also my closest friends) every day after work for the last 2 years (barring this year of 1month on and off). I realized that I will always be sucked back in unless they were to quit with me. I never want to push this on them; I know it has to be self-realization.

And this year, every time I quit I noticed a ""tension"" in the house; partly caused by me locking myself up in my room and not wanting to be around the smoking part of the house and partly cause I think they were ""mad"" at me for not ""socializing"". I love them, but the smoking part of the room was always a trigger for me to the point that my hands would start shaking.

This month, when I quit, I also told them I was moving out to my own apartment. It was such a scary thought; having to be alone in my own place. Just the thought of having to deal with moving my furniture to my own place caused me anxiety. I pushed past this the first four days; the fifth day, I was the most clear-headed and I knew I was ready to be on my own. I needed to move out and cut these people out of my life even though they're my best and only close friends I have in a city I moved to two years ago.

Fast forward to Oct 1st. I have moved into my own place with an amazing garden. I have furnished the place and have also started working out 3 times a week (hard to do more with my work schedule). I also met an amazing girl last week at a networking event (I would've never gone to before) and we've been seeing each other pretty much every day. I told my story and thought it would scare her but it was quite the opposite reaction! I'm not saying she's going to be my wife, but its a bright start for me.

Its kinda awkward between me and my friends cause I still have to go there and get some small stuff of mine that I might've left. But, I will get through this.

I went to the old apartment yesterday to grab some of my stuff and mail; the place smelled like green obviously but I felt apathy. No positive or negative feelings towards them. I am done with the green goddess and them. I will miss their friendship and the memories we had in the apartment. But it is just a phase of my life I will tell my kids (hopefully, one day).

Thanks again guys and the best of luck with quitting the green goddess. I know this is it for me, for SURE. And please, know this, **your confidence will come back 5 days off of this. Cut the weeds off your life!**

2019-10-02 12:53:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dccxwq/stay_strong_and_never_go_back/,Stay Strong and Never Go Back,"If I can offer any words to help in support of anyone struggling to quit it's to stay focused, and just know that in time you'll get there. You'll be able to live everyday under no influence whatsoever. This is probably my second similar post concerning my process of quitting within a week or so, but I'm fucking happy about life, and I never felt this way when I was smoking weed. I felt good for the duration of the high, but when it wore off I felt like complete shit.

I'm just so proud of myself for walking away knowing that weed caused the quality of my life to suffer at such a large extent that you don't realize the consequences until it's too late. By the time you want to quit you've reached the point of no return where you'll never smoke it again no matter if legalization is made on a federal level. Here's where you know your body has had enough when it's telling you to stop smoking because you're so fatigued, so moody/angry/depressed, easily agitated, and overall you're not functioning at your best level. You're essentially harming your body/mind and for what reason is this? To feel stoned? To laugh uncontrollably ? To have the munchies?  To watch porn, to have sex under the influence?

Weed is not safe to consume like we do. I say we because we're pot heads, real smokers, and we don't dabble with a gram here and there. We're the former ounce per week of high grade marijuana smokers. We're the constant vape pen inhalers. We don't smoke a little here and there.

We have to push it to the extremes.

I haven't rolled a blunt, smoked from a bowl, broken up any weed to consume since the end of April.

Let me also tell people who are going through withdrawals that it's not going to pass in a week, or even a month honestly. It'll be a long road to recovery because we've altered our brain chemistry so much that a full month of abstinence isn't going to bring you the results desired.

I honestly didn't feel like myself until July I believe.

This whole notion of a month free where you'll return to normal is a complete farce. Every long term smoker knows that quitting takes a toll on you mentally, physically, emotionally, and you'll encounter so many physical/emotional changes that to go back you know you've squandered months of recovery just to feel high again.

I never want to experience those withdrawals again. The period of quitting had to be one of the hardest changes that I faced because it was out of my control. I was at the mercy of marijuana leaving my body, but it was such a struggle that I don't know if I can be successful at an attempt again for quitting. The period for relapsing was always on the horizon, and I was so close several times to just give up on quitting. It could be related to age as I'm now 35, but fuck, the withdrawals itself took the life out of me until I was able to get myself on the right track of sobriety.

Never again.

The highs from marijuana aren't worth the recovery process that you'll face once you've quit for good.",30

2019-10-02 10:14:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dcarxm/fainted_after_smoking_officially_done/,"Fainted after smoking, officially done.","Sorry for the long post I just wanted to give the back story...

I've been wanting to quit for some time but couldn't get myself to do so. I quit for 18 days and was having a low fuck-it moment so I went and bought a g. I came home and smoked and felt incredibly anxious, my heart was racing and I had to change the action movie I was watching to something a little more happy go lucky. That didn't persuade me to stop though, the next morning I decided to do a little wake n' bake. After smoking I went to make myself some breakfast. As my oatmeal was in the microwave I started to see the snow static and my hearing was getting muffled. I should have just sat right down on the kitchen floor but my dad was watching a football game with my uncle and I didn't want to worry him (what happened was much worse and I almost gave my dad a heart attack) so I was thinking to myself ""okay lets go to the bathroom and sit on the floor and splash cold water on my face"" .... the next thing I know my dad is above me calling my name asking if I could hear him. I  was thinking to myself ""shit I just passed out"". 

I was right in front of the bathroom I didn't make it. Mind you, this was 20 mins after smoking but I'm sure that's the culprit. So my hearing was coming back and my dad asked my uncle to grab a pillow off the couch. My dad told me he heard a loud bang and then saw something poking out of the hallway (it was my hair). I let him know I'm okay since I knew he was really worried and he was just concerned for my well being (he's the absolute best ever). I was able to roll onto my side and lift myself up but I felt dizzy again so I leaned against the wall. My dad was sitting next to me and later he told me that started leaning to the one side as I went out of it again so he had to hold me up, he also said my mouth and eyes were twitching. I just thought I was leaning against the wall the entire time and leaning against him for support since I felt so weak. 

I ended up feeling nauseous so I scooted into the bathroom but it quickly went away once I leaned over the toilet but I started to get really really sweaty. Like every pore in my body was sweating. I was leaning against the tub and my dad and asked him if he could grab me a cold wash cloth. I had on my robe and held it against my chest as I tried to take my arm out so I could wipe the sweat of me. I was so weak and could barely move so my dad assisted holding the sleeve of my robe as I pulled my arm out. He kept cooling off the wash cloth for me and went to his room to get a little fan to put on the sink to aim at me. That helped wonders!!! My heart rate was going back up and my energy was coming back. I was able to get up and sit in front of the fan and my dad left the bathroom to give me some privacy. 

Once I was feeling better I went back to the kitchen and finished making my oatmeal and sat on the couch. My dad was holding his heart saying I scared him and he kept asking if I was okay. I was feeling better but I didn't want to move to get up, I felt like if I got up I would get dizzy again. He offered to go to my room to get my phone for me but I said no thank you it's okay. Once I finished eating he came over and grabbed my bowl and offered to make me some tea which I gladly accepted. My dads loving care and the tea helped tremendously!! Once I drank the tea I felt a million times better. I was able to get up and go to my room and I ended up going out shopping afterwards.

I looked at my FitBit after all was said and done and my heart rate went from 110 bpm to 58 bmp in a matter of 5 minutes, which is really scary. I'm really glad my dad was there, I don't know what I would do without him, but I also don't want to scare him ever again or feel like that ever again.

My head was fine, just a tiny little sore spot honestly, but my neck and ankle hurt. I guess it was from the way I fell I'm not really sure.

In all honesty though, I did smoke the rest of that g the next few days and felt okay but I thought to myself ""I don't need this and I don't want to pass out again"". I don't remember the exact day I stopped but I'm approximately 2 weeks clean now. I won't lie it's still kind of hard and I do want to smoke at times but it's just the ritual of it that I miss. I will say that it is easier this time than it was when I stopped for 18 days. I was miserable everyday. I just keep reminding myself of how crappy I felt and how worried I had my dad.

Thank you for reading. Be kind to yourself, it does get better. I never thought it would but it does I promise.",10
2019-10-02 10:09:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dcapdd/rleaves_and_sober_october/,r/leaves and Sober October...,"Hi all!

Since we're seeing a whole bunch of new visitors as a result of Sober October (welcome!) I wanted to clarify our policy, as we will be modding out some posts and comments related to Sober October.

Sober October is about taking a break for a month.  Taking a break to reset your tolerance or re-evaluate your relationship with smoking are all great things to do, but we are a narrowly focused sub for people who have made the difficult decision that they have to stop for good.

As a result, unless you make clear that you are using Sober October as your Day 1 to a cannabis-free life, we'll be taking out Sober October posts.

As I say, breaks are great if that's what you want, but it's just not what we do.

The good news is that there's a terrific group for support with taking breaks and managing moderation called r/Petioles.  They can help you make Sober October a success, and when Halloween comes around and you decide it's actually time to quit for good, then you'll always be welcome back to r/leaves.

Good luck with whatever path you decide to take!

Maybe it's just a routine toke, maybe you roll a 6-paper joint and down it all on your own, whatever. If I had a dollar for every ""swan song"" toke I had, I'd be a rich man. Anyways, The ""swan song"" can commonly be recognized by: A will to quit; A set deadline; A ""going away"" or ""one last joint/bong/etc"" to sort of cap it off. The objective is to get really, really high so that your last experience is a ""good one"".

Truth is, what you're doing to yourself is making the next few days a living hell. And this living hell is conducive to relapse. Fact of the matter is, when you're sober (I just finished 33 days), you don't give two fucks about the last time you smoked. Honestly, for me, I can't even remember what it was like, what I did, how much I smoked, was it sativa or indica, etc. 

You are most likely dependent upon weed at this point. You need it to get through the day. Having that one last blast, which is often a higher dose than your regular daily, is going to make you groggier in the morning, and going to make the short-term withdrawl symptoms worse.

So, fuck the last hurrah. It's a sham. It's a lie you tell yourself, because you (well, maybe not you, but I did this to myself) romanticize it. Objectively speaking, going to a special spot, smoking in a special or ceremonial way (big joint, smashing a bong, flushing a bag, declaring on social media, etc) will do *jack shit* for your actual efforts to quit. So forget that idea. It'll only make it harder to actually quit.

Best of luck everyone.",8

I gotta say that if you decided to quit don’t just sit at your comfort zone, do something like jogging, going out with friends or extra hours at work. that will make the process so much easier.

My late teens are supposed to be the best years of my life but now I’m closed off and don’t want to leave the house which has pushed me to make the decision to quit and experience my life fully.

My question is did you experience better memory recollection and mental clarity, if so how long did it take before you felt much less foggy in the brain.

Also any tips that helped you would be greatly appreciated.",12

The first day to two days sucked, cravings were bad and I got in touch with my dealer for the next order (which, fell through, so I took it as a sign that THIS was the time to stop).

I'm not sure where this will lead me, but I'm feeling great, TBH. 

It's fucking difficult, mina-san, but keep at it and before you know it you'll be here.

2019-10-01 22:53:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dc4ch3/dont_ever_take_a_quit_for_granted/,Don't ever take a quit for granted.,"A lot of times its easy to think, once you've been sober for any period of time, that you can just ""quit again"" if you relapse. As many have said here and in my own experience, actually quitting almost seems like a magical gift that you just wake up one day and do. Every time that I've planned to quit, I've failed. Every now and then, you'll wake up so hungover that you make a plan of what you'll do that evening instead of smoking, and it works about 5% of the time. That 5% of the time that you actually manage to make it to bed without smoking is PRECIOUS. It can't be replicated on a whim. That seems to be the nature of the drug and what it does to the mind. 

The point is, if you can manage to make it past that first night, or even better the second night, you're already past the hardest part. Don't EVER think, once sober, that you can ""smoke just once and quit again if you become addicted again"". Or thinking that ""I quit before, I can quit again if it gets out of hand"". The very nature of addiction is an inability to quit. Once it gets into your bloodstream, you will no longer be able to think rationally.

I write this angry because I was sober for two days, then I got drunk and smoked a TINY hit of resin that i scraped. Immediately that gremlin inside of me awoke and I became ravenous and angry that I didn't have more. No way around the thoughts. It is chemically altering me to want it. I didn't have ANY of these thoughts before or while I was drunk, I felt peaceful. But once my inhibitions were lowered, I thought ""Let me smoke this one hit of resin just to get the last of it out of the house"". I can't believe the way it compromised my mental state. Already an hour later I can feel that rage and the intense craving going away again. It made me so frustrated and torn I cried. Like talking to someone that you just broke up with on the phone knowing that there's no way you can piece things back together.

Thanks for reading this ramble, I had to get it out, maybe someone can relate to my experience or learn from it. I have no idea what I would do if this community wasn't here to let me know that there are other people out there just like me.",9

I'm a 24 year old male who growing up wasn't confident, but always had good friends and was successful in my studies, so found my way by my teenage years. That changed when I turned 18 and went away to university where I felt I was in my prime to boost my confidence and spread my wings, but unfortunately that confidence was placed in the hands of various party drugs and weed, and Later that year I returned home having failed my first year from smoking every day. 

In my time back home, I found solace in knowing that I was no longer in an environment to smoke anymore, and although I'd occasionally take party drugs every few months (which I don't see as the problem), my exposure to weed dropped to near nothing. I found myself in position not seen before, having the experience of being a free adult and being sober, I was confident once again. I felt confident enough that I re-enrolled in university and worked to save money so I could enjoy myself, but made sure to stay in an environment that meant I wouldn't start smoking again. So I studied a year at unversity and success came my way, although I didn't make a great deal of friends, I made a few and found myself in a position to move out from home again, to which I did... 

Maybe this was the mistake I shouldn't have made, because months later I found myself failing classes again with a poor sleeping pattern and a daily weed habit. By the end of the year I had passed 1 unit and failed the remaining so I decided to resit the year and ensure I didn't make the same mistake... but I still have a bad habit and a lifestyle which didn't facilitate a way out, so I managed to fail the year again.

4 Years of University down the drain, and for what? 1 successful year.

In my shame, I spent the next 12 months pretending to still be enrolled and play out the student lifestyle until the time came to graduate... which I didn't, since I had failed. Except the problem in all that is I allowed myself to prevent shame but didn't provide myself with a way out, which if I had been honest, I would've got in a moment.

I recently returned home after leaving my friends at university, and decided that I would no longer smoke when I moved home, and would stop after a big festival blowout. It's now coming up on 10 weeks since I stopped casually, around 9 weeks since I last picked up, and although I snapped after 4 weeks (the longest I've gone without smoking in 3 years) to celebrate a friends job, and although I snapped a week later when a friend put a joint/lighter in my face, and then 2 weeks after that when I finished that joint, I am now 1 week clean.

For the first time in a long time, I feel I am in control over what was a habit, which can now (if I so wish) be a reward as rare as holidays. I am left feeling down about breaking so many times already but I know that I have made so much progress already, and in not feeling the need to smoke, I am heading in the right direction to regain my mental strength and repay those around me who have put up with so much shit.

I know full well that I have dug myself a hole, and that I'm going to have to find my way out, but now that I'm sober I know that journey will be alot easier. I have the experiences of being lazy and unmotivated in the back of my mind, and although I feel I've lost so many chances from being high, I have learnt alot about myself so that when the point comes to step into the world and enjoy what I do, I'll take it with both hands.

Alright so that's my story. Feel free to comment, and ask any questions that you feel may help me or yourself.",7

Dumb as the tree-stump i am, i was going to try to moderate my smoking for once. Like REALLY try. It worked the first 2 days, when i could keep it to 1 or two bowls per day, but not for long. Day three i was back to smoking bowl after bowl, yet i was still trying to  rationalize my use. “It’s ok if you smoke on the weekends” “No there’s no side effects” even though i have gone through this withdrawal crap several times. 
The paranoia was becoming unbearable. I couldn’t be sure if things were real or not (to be honest it still happens). I was hiding outside smoking a bowl at around 2 in the morning, then i saw a person walking towards me. Hoodied, dark. First i just thought it was some guy walking around, but he started walking in circles around a lamp post, and up and down a hill. I was stricken with the most intense paranoia ever. Couldn’t even look out the window when i got home for fear of him waiting there.

After that shit, i decided to finish all my smoke as fast as possible. It was the worst week ever. I was so paranoid and afraid, i couldn’t go outside after dark without getting panic attacks.

I have come to the realization now that i need to stay clear of this shit for the rest of my life. So far it has brought me way too much pain. Fucked friendships, lost jobs, haven’t gotten arrested by some miracle though. Not to mention what it has done with my already messed up head. 
I am going back to therapy, and i applied for two jobs today which i am shitscared of so at least i got that going for me. There’s also been some talk about psych help in the workplace which could be nice. Or not.
I’m so sick of watching all my friends with their careers and all i got is a beerbelly and video games. 

IF YOU ARE THINKING OF LIGHTING UP AGAIN, FUCKING DON’T! SHOVE WEEDS BALLS UNDER YOUR HEEL AND CURBSTOMP ‘EM!

Lots of meticulous tasks at work to focus on, two friends in town to entertain, and to top it off my car broke down last week so I’m shopping for a new one.

6 months ago, I would not have been able to handle a week like this. 6 months ago, I made the decision to just walk away. Cold turkey. After years of casual use turned abuse. I was on autopilot, scared to feel, but I think even more scared to let more of my life go by in a blur. The “fog” was my normal. I was getting high before work, before every meal, before sleeping, in the middle of the night.

At the time, I was wrapping up a job I loved. I was on contract with some of my best friends, and we were all preparing to leave that city to move on to our next endeavor in our respective corners of the country. I knew I needed to change, both to be as prepared as possible for the job search and the transition but also to be present with the people who I consider family in my last few months being in close proximity of them.

I enjoyed weed. Hell, we all do. That’s why we’re here. We enjoy it too much. Smoking is a dangerous escape. It makes you complacent. It tells you you don’t have to feel. Everything seems more profound. It’s a switch you can turn on. I miss the ritual and the social aspect of it. I miss belonging very deeply to myself while analyzing my life, music, whatever. I always say that weed was amazing for my perspective on life, but not for my growth. You have to be uncomfortable to grow, and I was fine with the plateau as long as I had a few grams on me.

In the last 6 months I’ve proved to myself that I don’t need it. I may want it, but I don’t need it. I know I’m sharper. Towards the end there I could hardly have a quick response to something without my words fumbling. It gave me so much anxiety. I feel like I’m witty again. I focus better. My sleep is better, no matter how much I thought weed helped me sleep. I’m taking care of myself differently. I’m prioritizing the things I need to. I got the new job in the new city and I’m thriving here.

Sometimes I think I can have a casual relationship with weed again. A healthy one. But then I think about what it would be like to take that first hit again. Would I hate it? Would the high feel more like the prison I spent 6 months breaking out of? I don’t know if it’s worth the experiment, but I’m curious if I’m keeping it real. 

Anyway, this sub has helped a lot. I’m proud of all of you, no matter where you are on the road. It’s hard, but it’s worth it to feel lows so you can appreciate the natural highs. Keep at it friends. 

Now, back to this crazy day.",9

Today is my first day really quitting. No once a week or once every 2 weeks bullshit because i always end up just going on an all day binge for weeks. My girlfriend decided to quit for the month as well so it’s nice to have that support to lean on. 

I love smoking weed. Recently i’ve had bad experiences related to brain fog, lack of motivation, etc. but i really loved smoking weed. I was a bored virgin with no real friends at 16 and after i started smoking it was something to do in my suburban neighborhood with nothing to do and i was able to connect to way more people and have a sort of social life i dreamed of before i started. It made food taste better, movies and music jaw dropping, and basically turned an evening of nothing into an evening of something. For years i loved weed and hated everyone that hated it. I smoked almost daily for years (gradually picking up frequency) as I was a high schooler with no real responsibilities and no real worries with the same old friends that i’ve smoked with up until now. 

Fast forward 4 and a half years and something has drastically changed. What made me feel on top of the world, social, and basically made a part of my identity turned on me. I’m sluggish in thinking and speech and spend hours all day thinking about weed instead of school, jobs, social life, etc. I’ve formed a shit load of bad habits and weed no longer brings me the happiness it once did. I’m quitting for the longest time I have since I started and even though it’s going to be hard, I know after the first few weeks of unrest i’ll really start to see the benefits. I hope someone can relate to my experience and we can get through the lie that marijuana is great for everyone at every time pushed on to us by society and the people around us. I am addicted to marijuana and today is the day that I begin to put this addiction to rest. Maybe one day i’ll smoke again, but that day is out of mind until i’m back to where i want to be.

So I’ve been a heavy user for a little over 2 years and a daily user for nearly a year. I’ve been trying to quit for probably 4 months with many “Day 1s”. There was a two week period in which I couldn’t find a single person to buy from and I remember feeling so clear-minded and waking up in the morning was so much easier...but after only a couple days of that I found a new plug and was right back where I started. This time feels different. I didn’t smoke to go to sleep last night, I didn’t smoke before class this morning, and I won’t smoke before work.

As we get older we find more and more reasons to seek medical help, and consequently are less afraid to bring stuff up.  A doctor who does this on professional basis is more able to chart the path to recovery than are we here on leaves.  Let me know if it works but say give it a try.

The last time I posted on this sub was February of last year, I was 3 months sober and really proud of myself in that regard and then I fell flat on my face and haven't recovered since. I've been putting off a lot emotionally (breakup w/ a woman I really loved, issues with family, you know, all the trials that come w/ being humans) and am a bit of a workaholic, meaning I really don't slow down until I put my head on the pillow. When I'm not working, I'm working on side projects. Everything i do involves smoking. My crew @ work is all functional stoners minus boss. My friends are all stoners, my family all uses marijuana in one way or another, however, i definitely consume the most. I am a farmer also, so it really runs through my veins. I woke up and didn't roll before work. I've been @ work all day and haven't smoked. Tonight when I get home, the temptations are going to be high. Alas, hope for the best but prepare for the worst. I can either do this now at 22, or I could have done It like i said at 19, or i can keep on waiting and wake up one day and be 40, stoned off my ass, and complaining about the overall situation. I won't smoke today, hopefully you guys won't either. Much love, will check in later.",28

Try not to worry.

Worrying when you are feeling like shit increases anxiety, and anxiety increases worry. Vicious circle that becomes truth in your own mind. This also gets worse if you start getting ideas from the internet on what you might have. You are only shooting yourself in the foot by doing this.

Have a look at ""CBT for dummies"", there's a PDF version or 2 free on google. Its a self help book. CBT is a therapy method of overcoming depression, anxiety and all sort of issues, widely used by therapists. It's the first tool used to treat those and would recommend the book if you cannot afford to see a phsychotherapist. 

It gets better, but not just by waiting! You have to put in the work yourself too.",24

  So how do I start this off.. I am here writing this on my (n)th day 1... I've been using drugs for about 11 years and pretty much daily for the past 8 and ,quite honestly, it completely ruined me. I've been trying to quit since forever but the drugs and alcohol have always seemed to have a stronger grip on me than I realize.. I would get high and/or drunk everyday, go back home and tell myself that this is it just to wake up the next morning and get right back at it.. This terrible cycle has been going on now for longer than I remember, and I really need it to end. 

  My life has transformed into a series of terrible consequences of orienting my life towards just getting high and feeling good. I am now paying the price of all these wasted years. My professional life is in awful shape (if you can even call whatever this is a ""shape"" in the first place) , my social life, as it stands now, is comprised of a bunch of friends who only get together to get high. I feel sickly, weak, insecure, depressed... I am unable to provide properly for my wife and baby daughter... all my peers are significantly ahead of me in life... you get the picture but basically I am face to face with the ugly truth, that I, and only I, brought this upon myself by choosing to drink and do drugs instead of living an honest, productive and meaningful life. I feel so stupid for not having had the foresight that this dark and lonely place is where I'll end up.

  Excuse the bleak tone of the day 1 post. It is what it is and I can't lie anymore. My life is shit right now. I am 30 years old and have basically wasted my 20s over drugs and alcohol. I have very little to nothing to show for any of it, which is especially painful knowing that before I single handedly destroyed myself I was a talented, confident, healthy, attractive and hard working human being with a lot of potential. I could've been way more successful and could have achieved much more in my 20s but I chose drugs... instant gratification over long term growth and this is where it has lead me. 

  My number 1 priority right now is to make a full 180 degree turn in regards to my lifestyle, health and overall well-being.  I know that beneath all this shit I have piled upon myself through years of abusing drugs, my talents and potential remain and it is imperative that I get 100% sobre and clean if I am to re-connect to  these and start living my best life as the best version of myself... I know I have it in me to be massively successful but I have to take back full control of my life first.

*--------------------------*

  **Here are a few things that I know will be massively helpful in the journey up from this dark hole I've dug myself towards the light, where the best version of myself is waiting to start building the beautiful, positive and meaningful life I** ***know*** **I am able to create for myself and my family.**

1) Figure out the root causes of why I'm addicted to drugs and alcohol and properly address these issues. *This will require some deep soul searching and studying but I know myself better than anyone, and if I'm brave enough, I'll be able to stand up to and face all my traumas, insecurities and heartbreaks that have set the stage for years of escapism trying to numb the pain in me.*

2) Write here on r/leaves daily for the first 21 days... *I believe that the first 3 weeks are the hardest, and it is a time where some sort of relatability with and support from a like minded community will prove extremely beneficial. After the first 3 weeks I'll surely pop back into this subreddit to show and get support and offer up any new insights and findings that have helped me on my personal journey*

3) Totally avoid people that use drugs and alcohol even if it means that I'll go into a period of isolation until I am able to start building new healthy relationships with friends both old and new... *pretty much self explanatory.* 

4) Create a (PROS and CONS) sheet of being addicted to drugs and alcohol and review this daily... *Looking at this list will make it immediately evident why I should not be doing any sort of drugs and remind me of why sobriety is extremely important.*

5) Commit everyday to being clean and staying clean... *I should do this every morning for as long as I live. I've already wasted a decade of my life and I am not willing to waste anymore time*

6) Do cognitive behavioral therapy daily...  ((*DEFINITION:* [Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)](https://psychcentral.com/lib/in-depth-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/) *is a short-term, goal-oriented psychotherapy* ***treatment*** *that takes a hands-on, practical approach to problem-solving. Its goal is to change patterns of thinking or* ***behavior*** *that are behind people's difficulties, and so change the way they feel)) -- This basically means that I have to pay attention to and change the negative thinking habits that have caused me to make the decisions I made in the past... I've tried this for some time and it really does work wonders for your overall mood by cleaning up any toxic and poisonous thoughts that exist in your psyche, whether you are aware of these thoughts or not. This* [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009UW5X4C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) *is an excellent place to start if you are interested.* 

7) Start building healthy habits and routines... *a proper lifestyle with it's healthy habits and routines is probably the best assurance against relapsing and backsliding.* 

*--------------------------*

  I would like to thank you If you have read this far into the post and I would like to wish you, me and everyone here the best of luck against this monster called drug addiction. 

  I hope this was in any way shape or form helpful to anyone going through addiction and trying to make it out.

Recently I have been using it as a serious coping mechanism, so much so that I just smoke until I completely forget about all of my problems. I have gotten lazy in school and in my relationships. Literally all I think about all day is ""when can i get high?"" It has got to stop. Im officially ready to put it down, but honestly im scared im fixing to start feeling my emotions at full magnitude again, and that is a little exciting and a lot terrifying.

I also room with my biggest smoking buddy. Eager to see how all this turns out. Will update soon!

As many do, I started smoking more weed when I stopped drinking.

I’ve been smoking weed almost every day since I was 14/15. I’m 28 now. Weed brings me no joy anymore, it’s just engrained in my life. A part of me I no longer enjoy, and I recognize now the damage I’ve done to my brain, my motivation, my relationships and my overall goals/quality of life.

Today marks day 1 for me. I’m shooting for Sober October - an entire month of 100% clean living. I’ll be incorporating exercise and a good diet (which I’ve already been doing for months) but please r/leaves, any additional advice and/or support would truly mean a lot.

Dreams are coming back and it's pretty clear my brain is sending me a message.,"I couldn't help but laughing when I woke up this morning. I had another restless night filled with weird dreams that clearly originated from my anxiety.

I dreamed I was cheated on by a girl, which happened to me once years ago and to this day I'm still not able to trust. I also dreamed it was 10 days before the end of my apartment's lease and I didn't have a place to go. Since I'm moving next July I'm already pretty anxious about this. My last dream was about me getting fired from my job because I'm not good enough. As an anxious person, it's no surprise I feel like I'm underqualified and underperforming in my current job.

I'm taking this with humor because I learned to rationalized my anxiety. It doesn't make sense to be stressed about moving in like 10 months. Humor is my coping tool for today.

Through prayer, early morning walks, exercise, limiting sugar, eating as clean as possible. Ive been able to continuously fight this battle.

For those in beginning recovery don't give in or up. Yes it's hard, frustrating and frightening. But it will be worth the fight. And it will get better. 

Caution: Don't fall for the ""you will feel better in 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months"" shit because you may not. I believe it's a set up for disappointment which can be discouraging.

When I Quit I want to be High.,"It’s funny because almost every time I smoke I have this feeling like ‘why did I just do that?’ Then I sober up and I’m like ‘when can I do that again?’

It’s so weird. Then I talk to my inner-sober-self and say ‘why are you always saying I should quit?’

It’s crazy. To the people around me I’m so ‘high-functioning’ that they think I’m silly for trying to quit. They say ‘why? You have it all under control. It’s like your glass of wine at the end of the night’ but deep down inside I feel like a daily smoker cannot be functioning at their full potential. 

Anyway. Long story short. This is why I haven’t been able to quit fully. When I don’t smoke I think I’m depriving myself from some sort of treat that I am deserving of. And, when I do smoke I feel like I’m depriving myself of a better lifestyle. 

I only post this here because I see a lot of members saying things like ‘you will quit when you really want to.’ But sometimes I ask what about those of us who don’t ‘want’ to but maybe should? 

Here’s to Sober October.

A couple of months ago I had a hash joint at a party, it was alright I enjoyed it and I think I had a good time and didn't wake up with a ganj over.

However I was not and before I knew it I was back to smoking in the morning through till night and hiding from work to smoke and becoming the version of myself I hate. This continued, until this Sunday gone I decided I had lost control and was back to square one.

Now I also have seasonal affective disorder, It gets worse around this time of year. It appears to be worse than normal but I have a feeling its the quitting mixed with the low mood and depression I have come to expect at this time of year 

I am so angry and disappointed in myself for loosing my self control and feeling this was again. 

I don't even know why I wrote this but I needed to talk about it and tell people, I've been too embarrassed to tell living people but maybe somone will read this and gain control again before or get some insight from it or something.
