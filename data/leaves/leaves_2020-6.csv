I was having a real shitty day yesterday where my chronic pain condition was really acting up. I had a Skype session with my therapist and told him I really needed to stop smoking weed now. He gave me the usual tips (don't keep anything at home, drink some bed time tea instead and all the other crap) and then he asked me when I was going to start and I said today, kind of... You could see from his face that he wasn't going to believe me. He noted down the date and his shitty reverse psychology worked lol. I didn't even have a craving for it last night! I played some guitar, actually drank that cup of tea lol, then went to bed. I'm taking sleep aids as well so it was actually really easy to fall asleep. I sweated a lot during the night but getting up was SO much easier! Normally I feel like shit in the morning, super foggy and slow and here I am. I just need so much more energy to go through with this, especially with all my pain but I know I can do it! I just love you guys at r/leaves. You all have a beautiful day and know we can do it!!!

1,2020-06-29 23:56:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hifsaf/day_1_this_sucks/,Day 1. This sucks.,"Let me preface this by saying this is a very negative post. I am in a shitty place mentally right now and I'm writing this to try and get some of that out in a reasonably productive way. To the mod team, if you feel that you need to take this post down because it is not conducive to the environment you're trying to create and the recovery of others in this subreddit, I completely understand.

I'm a 24 year old woman who has been smoking pretty much daily for the last five years. I graduated college about a year ago and moved back in with my mom afterwards. I quit smoking briefly for about 2 months after I initially moved back home because of the smell. After I found a job in my degree field, I lit up ""just to celebrate,"" bought a vape pen with my first paycheck so it wouldn't smell, and went back to being a daily smoker. I am trying to quit now because my family got a permit to summit one of my states iconic mountains this Fall. It's a day hike, not particularly hard (>5,000ft elevation gain), but I don't want my shitty stoner lungs to ruin it for me or anyone else. Plus, I've known I need to quit for years, but all my attempts so far have failed. Now seems like as good a time as any. 

I've been going through this subreddit for a while and everyone else's Day 1 posts seem so full of determination and commitment and hope for the future. I wish I could feel that way. I just feel dread. It's not that I'm not dissatisfied with my life, or that I don't recognize the role weed plays in substituting short-term pleasure for long-term progress. It's the fear of confronting the reality of who I am without it. I hate the person I've become. I don't have any meaningful long-term goals. Everything I want feels unattainable. I have no real interests or hobbies. I'm a boring, shitty, unreliable person, and as much as I would like to blame weed for that, I can't. 

The inescapable question: am I an unmotivated asshole because I smoke too much weed, or do I smoke too much weed because I'm an unmotivated asshole? Unfortunately, all evidence thus far points to the latter. After numerous attempts at quitting, I've come to the unpleasant realization that the only difference between sober me and stoner me is that stoner me has something to look forward to at the end of the day. Deep down, I know that's not really true. I know that progress takes time and effort, and that quitting is the necessary first step that will allow me to put that in. But it's so unfair. 

Even if I make it through all the misery of quitting, there's no guarantee that I'll have the willpower and strength of character to work on myself and avoid relapse. And even if I work on myself and avoid relapse, there's no guarantee that I'll ever stop hating myself or my life. 

I feel like I'm clinging to a rock in the surf. I know that I need to swim to shore, and I know that in order to swim I have to let go of the rock. But how can I hope to swim when I already feel so close to drowning? And how can I swim to a shore that I can't even see? I've been a regular smoker for my entire adult life. I don't know who I am without it. I don't know who I want to be without it. That shape on the horizon could be an island, but it could just as easily be the fin of a shark ready to swallow me whole. What if I reach the shore and it's just as bad? What if the water in my lungs was never due to drowning, but rather a symptom of some horrible, inescapable condition that is intrinsic to who I am? Why should I force myself to suffer for the promise of a beautiful future that may never come? 

I still want to quit. I want to stand at the top of that mountain. I want to look down its slope and think about how beautiful the view is, not about how much I wish I was at home smoking weed. I want to be the person that my parents think I am, someone my brothers can look up to, without having to lie by omission. What terrifies me is the possibility that that person might not exist - or even worse, that I might not have the strength to become that person. The waves are so high, and the shore is still so far away. But the tide is rising and I have to let go.

If you read this miserable post all the way to the end, thank you for your time. If you are a moderator and you want to remove this post because you think it might be triggering/unhelpful to other people, feel free (and I apologize for the inconvenience). The hour and a half I spent writing this post was an hour and a half I wasn't smoking weed. It served its purpose. To everyone else who has posted to this subreddit, thank you for sharing.

So after dinner I go upstairs and his family is hitting their little vape thing. This brought me for a ride as I sat there and watched them not wanting to be rude. His dad offers it to me and I said ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù impulsively because I knew that was my new answer. And then I realized what had just happened. For the first time in 5 years, I said no to the thing I have never said no to before. I know I don‚Äôt deserve a gold metal or anything but I was really proud and I went to the bathroom and started ugly sobbing  because I could not believe what just happened.

I know and love so many activities that are healthier for me, but there is a block to starting them, and I default to the comfort of smoking weed.

Reading through this community and I appreciating the deep love and support. Over the last 6 months I have been more serious about quitting and had some long stretches (the longest being 1 month) - But I am writing this now to commit to truly stopping. Living a sober and healthy life! Because every time I just smoke 1 joint, it turns into 2, into 4 days of smoking, then comes the deep cravings again.

it‚Äôs been 5 days with no weed, surprisingly it‚Äôs been easy, i think because i was so strong on the mindset that weed wasn‚Äôt good for me and i was so tired and bored of being high all the time. it‚Äôs almost like being sober is my new high? i know it sounds cheesy, but i actually feel like i‚Äôm alive. i haven‚Äôt had much withdrawals, this might be because i cut down tremendously before quitting totally, i would hit very small bs, i still have an appetite and i haven‚Äôt had much trouble sleeping, oh and!! i‚Äôm having dreams again:)) i was a bit short tempered the first two days, and i‚Äôve noticed i‚Äôve been more emotional, mostly when i get very bored (a feeling a haven‚Äôt felt in a long time).

and i‚Äôm sooo much better at video games! it‚Äôs crazy, i can actually play league now without making stupid mistakes. I thought every experience was better high but i was so wrong.

-28 years old
-smoking for 14 years
-smoking daily for 2 years
-haven't smoked in 2 weeks

I used to smoke almost every single day after work and most weekend nights/days. Finally decided to give it up for multiple reasons which aren't relevant to this.

I know headaches are fairly common with quitting any addictive substance, I usually get a headache if I don't have a coffee in the morning.

Two weeks seems like a long time for physical side effects of quitting though no? I know it's not a hydration issue, I drink a ton of water throughout the day. The headaches themselves aren't that bad, mild annoyance to moderate and they usually clear up with Advil. Is this common with quitting weed or should I be looking elsewhere for the cause?

2 months ago I decided my life was shit and I needed to do something about it. At the moment I am 24 years old and I've smoked weed excessively for 9 to 10 years. I've quit cigarettes 60 days ago, weed 30 days ago. This is my story and how I'm feeling so far. 

I've known that my life was shit for a longer time, but 2 months ago I finally flipped the switch to start making it better.  I got introduced to weed by a friend at school at the age of 14, we sometimes smoked and played Halo at his house all night and smoke some more the next day.

After finishing this school and moving to the next one I met another friend, this is where the weed smoking started to happen daily, this was around the age of 16. We'd skip school because school was dumb and smoke weed everyday, sometimes we would to go the gym and other times we would just walk around the city and talk shit and laugh and be high all the time. When we were actually at school we were high 90% of the time, so was the rest of the class.

On the day we graduated we went to a coffeeshop which sold the best hasj in the country and asked for a few grams of it. We bought it, sat on a bench in the park somewhere, started smoking and eventually we sat there for around 7 to 8 hours being high as fuck. For the record; I live in Holland and weed/hasj is very strong here with a high THC percentage. 

After I graduated I started working and lost contact with this friend and also lost my girlfriend which was really rough. The weed use continued though. Every day after work I would come home, smoke some joints and either waste my time on Reddit, just sitting on the couch staring at the wall, watching TV, playing video games or masturbating furiously. 

And here we are in 2020 amidst some fucking Coronacrisis which made me realize my life is shit. I had no meaning in life, barely any friends, no girlfriend, no ambitions, sleeping in for work because I was fucking high all the time. So I decided to quit weed for the final and last time, I've tried to quit multiple times but I always failed, same thing with cigarettes. 

I've been free of cigarettes for 60 days now and free of weed for 30 days. Here are the benefits I have noticed so far:

* \- I always thought I wasn't a morning person or had some weird ass sleeping apnea which made me tired every morning, guess what? Smoking weed caused it
* \- My mind has become much clearer, I am able to think and analyze faster while also feeling emotions I've probably never felt before. Also my mindset is WAY less negative. I'm still a cynical and pessimistic person but my views are more positive than before. 
* \- I have the urge to learn new stuff and make something of my life. Weed causes you to be happy with what you have and entertains you. This is fine if you have a few million on the bank, otherwise it is not most of the time. 
* \- I save a ton of money per month. Quitting Cigarettes + Weed saves me around 250 Euro's a month which is always nice. 
* \- I have way more energy and a better physical condition with no shortness of breath.
* \- I am more social and no longer decline invites of people who want to do something because I'm high as fuck playing videogames in my underwear. 
* \- I have realized I don't really like the work and do and how my life is turning out, not sure if this is positive but atleast I'm doing something about it now.
* \- My appetite is way better, I try to eat healthy foods as much as possible now. 
* \- I've quit social media. I sometimes still do Reddit though ;) 

At the moment I'm working out 4 days a week, sleeping 7-8 hours every night. reading atleast 1 hour of everyday, trying to become a more knowledgeable and better person and becoming more social. 

This subreddit has kept me motivated while quitting, sometimes I would just scroll through the posts and read the benefits people reaped from quitting weed. At this moment I have no urges to either smoke cigarettes or weed. Weed is a silent killer which slowly creeps into your life and makes you a dull person without any ambitions or hobbies.

Thank you for reading, this has become quite a long post. I just started typing and tried to make the best of it. I hope some of you take some motivation out of this to quit weed or to stay off it. If you have any questions let me know.",100,1

I thought with weed I could always wake up the next day and do every day things.  I would toke up and study, go to classes, drive, cook, go to meetings, go to work high.  Weed makes you high but still functional....right?

But here‚Äôs the catch.  Weed makes you fucking dumb.  You don‚Äôt feel your head pounding like a hang over does but you have mental fog, poor memory, and difficulty concentrating.  It is harder to learn.  To communicate.  To be present in the moment.  

It is really hard to realize the difference for us current and former stoners.  But when you go sober after smoking so much for so long you realize the hangover of weed is BAD.

And no joint is worth feeling totally dumb and useless the next day.

Feeling productive, present, and sober is better than any joint.

 I've been trying to quit for just over a year now and all i've been able to do it cut down about 65%.

I've been abusing substances since I was about 15, anything I can get my hands on. I settled on weed one day cuz it is easy and not looked down on. I can't seem to stop relying on it. I like i go as long as I can before I vape, but i still use it every day, about 3 times.

I started using to numb myself emotionally, and continued to do that combined with alcohol for about 7 years.

I successfully quit alcohol after reaching a serious low, but I've been terribly unable to quit weed no matter how hard I try.

I have generalized anxiety, and am prescribed amphetamines for Executive Function Disorder, I am also Bi Polar. I vape whenever I get anxious, and I vape when I get stressed or overwhelmed. 

I like to try to go as long as I can without it everyday but I either get anxious, overwhelmed, stressed, or honestly even fatigued from my meds and it'll have me wanting to smoke.

I'm tired of relying on weed.
I'm on disability(I'm in Ontario, Canada) and it takes a chunk out of what I could use for groceries, or savings.

I just dont know how to quit while I'm this reliant on it.
I'm so fucking scared I'm going to spiral if I quit cold turkey, but weening off only got me to cut down.

I don't know what to do anymore.

So I am here. I didn't even know this place existed. I had no idea there was this much support for something I thought of as overlooked. 

I need to quit.
I want to be happier.
I want to be free.",2,0

I've struggled with all sorts of substances (alcohol and marijuana being the most abused) since I was 13 or so, and I am now 31. I've been in and out of various 12 step programs in that time, putting together 7 years clean, then a little over a year clean several times. Overall I'd say the last 18 years or so I've probably spent half the time sober and trying to be a productive member of society, and half the time using whatever I could to escape reality and numb my feelings. Marijuana is a favorite of mine, and is always a staple in my substance diet whenever I'm using. I also live in a medical state and have experience growing my own with much success. It's a really fun hobby that I miss.

The last few times I got sober, it was because I had begun to develop alcohol withdrawals that would land me in the hospital. Since I'm an all or nothing kinda guy, I typically quit everything when this happens and find myself back in a 12 step group pretty quickly. I highly recommend checking out a 12 step group if you're not completely turned off by the concept of a higher power.

In November of 2018 I asked my girlfriend to take me to the ER and began my last detox from alcohol. We were both marijuana users at the time, and I planned on trying to continue smoking with her and abstaining from alcohol. However within a month she decided she would stop (without any issues on her end), and I began to have chronic panic attacks when I would smoke. So I quit smoking on March 16, 2019 and had been completely sober for just over a year when quarantine started.

THE RELAPSE-

Being isolated at home, I decided to experiment with natural ways to get off of my sleeping meds and impatiently went to the dispensary to see if there was something I could try with minimal THC. There I found a cartridge with 4%THC. The goal was not to get high, as I was not actively trying to relapse.

The first night I took a small puff and slept great. The next night I took two puffs and slept great. The next day I brought it with me on a bike ride and got high as hell riding around on a sunny April day. Three weeks later I had gone through about 15 cartridges, all with increasingly high THC and was hitting them all day. By the end of the eighth week I was straight up dabbing high THC live resin all day, and scrounging up change when I would wake up without any. I was right back to my normal usage. One day the inevitable happened, and I began to experience full on panic whether I used or abstained. This whole period took me 8 weeks start to finish. I knew I had to quit again, so I called my partner and came clean and got myself into another 12-step meeting through Zoom that day. The next day was my first full day sober, June 10th, 2020.

The withdrawals I experienced were intense, and not unlike withdrawing from alcohol. It seems that I am becoming more and more sensitive to substances and withdrawals as I get older. I had almost all of the classic withdrawal symptoms, and some unusual ones which I'm hoping maybe someone can relate to. The things I experienced are-

ANXIETY-This began a few days before I quit entirely and got worse until about day 7 when it began to taper down. For me this included shaking, tunnel-vision, dizzy spells, and feeling numb, almost like my whole body was made out of a tightly stretched rubber band. Fast heart beat, and a general 'crawling out of my skin' feeling was the norm during this time. I could not drink any caffeine at all, and I am a regular coffee drinker. Since I'm no stranger to serious panic attacks, I knew what to expect, but this was absolutely one of the most uncomfortable times of my life.

TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATION-This manifested itself as constant hot and cold flashes, sweating through all my clothes, foul smelling body odor, and the infamous night sweats. I believe this also took about a week before my temperature began to level out.

INSOMNIA-This is something I am still dealing with and is probably something I will need to work on for a long time, but the first few days was basically impossible to sleep more than a few hours at a time. Lucky for me I still have a small amount of a prescription for sleep that I was able to use.

WEIGHT LOSS/ LACK OF APPETITE-This is another common symptom, however for me it started BEFORE I quit. I had already lost about 10 pounds by the time I quit, and another 10 during the first week sober. I am currently at my lowest ever weight, at the low end of what is considered healthy for my height and age. I can say that my appetite has mostly returned 19 days in, however it seems to have changed, and I no longer want sweets of any kind. This is an interesting development and something I'm going to roll with and use to my advantage.

This brings me to the weirdest one, that I'm hoping someone out there might relate to.

CANKER SORES/MOUTH ULCERS-These began around the second day sober and initially felt like the roof of my mouth was on fire. I thought I may have burned it, but was dealing with such a whirlwind of weird bodily sensations that this was not my biggest concern. As the days went on, the burning sensation became canker sores that appeared on the roof of my mouth, then on my tongue. Then it became a sore throat. This lasted about a week and continued to get worse although all my other symptoms were getting better. Being a hypochondriac and this being a new experience for me, I made a doctor's appointment to be safe, considering the current situation with the pandemic. Somewhere around 13 days in I decided to have a look in my mouth with my phone's camera and flash and saw the biggest canker sore I've ever had on the BACK of my throat. I believe this is what could be called a throat ulcer, but I'm no doctor and the appointment has been rescheduled so many times that it is now scheduled for tomorrow. Yesterday it finally began to feel better, and today for the first time in several weeks I don't have any pain and it feels like they are finally healing.

I've done lots of research, and I've been able to find evidence that this is common among those who quit smoking cigarettes, and I've even been able to find a few bits of anecdotal evidence that this can happen when quitting marijuana too. It can also happen to anyone who gets canker sores and is under intense stress. It's been so weird for me that I thought it might help for me to share it in case others are dealing with this as well.

Overall I feel so much better today. Exercise, daily meditation and diet seem to have helped tremendously. I've been able to sleep and eat fairly normally, I'm not sweating through my clothes, and I'm not nearly as anxious and have been able to introduce caffeinated tea back into my life. I'm still going to zoom meetings everyday and have connected with a sponsor and began the steps, since these are things that have worked for me in the past. I'm grateful again to be able to live without planning my next fix 24/7, and this has been a reminder and a lesson for me that no matter how long I stay sober and build up my life, it can all get torn down in a VERY short period of time. When I get sober, I tend to stay sober long enough to forget why I did in the first place. That's why it's important to stay connected, continue to take advice and trust others and share my experience with those who might be struggling where I have been able to succeed.

Thank you so much for reading and for having me in your community. Best of luck to all of us in staying clean.

This month instead of spending all that money on weed I‚Äôve been putting it into my savings account and slowly seeing it grow, by reflecting on how much I spend on weed it‚Äôs also made me reflect on how much I‚Äôve been spending on other unneeded shit which goes alongside my weed habit; junk food, coffee and tobacco to name a few.

I finally feel like I'm not alone in this and reading your stories helps me believe I can make it. I was clean for a week and then I was overly confident in myself that just a couple hits with the boys wouldn't hurt. Before i knew it I smoked a gram in a couple of hours. The next day reminded me of why I wanted to quit in the first place. Motivation to get shit done was completely gone, cravings were worse than when i hadn't had any weed for a week and wiping my progress off my whiteboard felt discouraging as hell. The worst part was that when I did smoke and i finished the joint, I realised the effect didn't make me happy at all, and it is just the experience of smoking i love so much, which lasts for only for about 10 minutes.

I feel like when I was high, I felt good during the day, I was able to get enthralled about things like programming, developing skills, exercising, video games, TV shows/movies, etc. Ever since I quit I have a hard time getting into things, I'm scatter-brained and constantly seeking easy quick stimulation. I can't sit down and read a book even if it's one I should be able to enjoy and focusing on things is as hard as ever. Even focusing on one person talk in a noisy room is as hard as ever. There's a lot of things that I've recently associated with ADHD that I'm struggling with, much more than when I was smoking weed all the time.

According to some research, weed can both boost dopamine in the brain and act as an in-direct dopamine reuptake inhibitor. This is basically exactly what ADHD medications do. I'm starting to wonder if weed is basically a foggy, stoney, dirty version of what ADHD meds are. Weed (for me at least), just made me happy, calm, and generally more able to slow down and focus. I recently took an adderall out of curiosity and it felt basically the exact same as I remember weed feeling, except without the body high and stoney symptoms. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I was self-medicating ADHD with weed for years without even realizing it. Or, perhaps chronic marijuana use permanently altered the reward pathways in my brain, lowering my tonic dopamine levels which is basically the cause of ADHD.

I'm pretty much just looking for other people's thoughts on this. Thanks!",2,0

For me, I mainly hang out and have always smoked with my brother 10 years. I‚Äôm 26. I‚Äôm done with school but back home, he‚Äôs finishing in about a year, year and a half. When quitting I usually crack and get it on my own or go ‚Äúsocialize‚Äù with my brother and smoke with him. It feels like we both have to stop but obviously I can only make my own decisions. Lately there is this ‚Äústarting after this bowl‚Äù mentality. Transitioning into a new job after covid that I‚Äôm really looking forward to. Not necessarily a video game addict but have fallen into phases of being a shut-in at times. Maybe quitting video games, coffee, weed and other stimulants all at once is just too much. In regards to weed it feels like I have to give up the relationship/friendship with my brother in some strange way. I know I just need to break through a barrier and then I know I‚Äôll be returning back to a more normal state. Maybe I need more of my own friends. Or my own place. It seems I need to ride this out alone and away from my family particularly my brother. 

The only time it seemed I was able to break through was when I moved up north for college and had no connects obviously. It was a weird mood swinging and silent first 3-4 days. I felt a bit anxious moving somewhere new by myself but also felt inspired. I think the emotions flooding back got to me initially. I don‚Äôt think you can really avoid that when you smoke for 10 years. I‚Äôm currently looking at moving up north again to get a new job and be around smaller towns doing wildland firefighting. So if i want to get a federal gig I need to quit. I think this is the best thing for me, however it seems I cant find the emotion or discipline in me to help summon up the courage/motivation needed to get past these days. I love my brother but we are obviously at different phases of life. I like to goof off but I tend to be more vocal about my ambitions in life. He knows I want more than just sitting around playing video games. Idk if he truly does. He was working a job and wasn‚Äôt smoking very often it seemed. He was in good shape and healthy. After I came back home from school it seems it‚Äôs only been bad for both of us. I have this scenario in my head where we just both suddenly quit and become responsible career driven adults who are ready to engage what life has to offer. Go travel, meet people, accomplish things, gain new skills. We can always reflect back afterward.  I think I‚Äôm only expecting that from him so it can make it easier for me to quit while he doesn‚Äôt have to. I stopped the day before yesterday, and yesterday I did cave and smoke in the late evening, just once. I don‚Äôt know if a gradual reduction in use is better for my withdrawals? I just need to suck it up and go tunnel vision for 3 days and just sit with all the emptiness, while bargaining with myself about what I‚Äôm willing to do that day to make my life better.

Since late 2017, most of my friendships have stemmed from weed in one form or another. Either we smoke together, I provide for them, they provide for me, etc.
I feel like when I initiate friendships, I always start it by being the ""generous stoner"" type.

I'm a very shy, (introverted) ambivert, but I struggle to maintain a conversation. I struggle to connect and relate to other people, and my whole life I've felt like an outsider. 
Weed fixed that. And now it feels like it's all I have socially.

I really don't know what to do. It seems like my choices are stuck between;

A: I keep smoking and become the typical unproductive stoner stereotype, with some decent connection and social life.

I‚Äôd been a heavy user throughout college, and while transitioning to a full-time job I decided that it‚Äôs time to take control of my relationship with the drug. Some advice for those who are just beginning:

* **Write down why you want to stop smoking**. For many of us, the turning point was one night where we got stoned and simply realized ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep doing this.‚Äù It‚Äôs helpful to write your reasons down so that you can reference them in the future and keep holding yourself accountable. 

* **Be kind to yourself**. It‚Äôs going to be difficult, and you may find yourself wondering why you can‚Äôt stop thinking about weed, why you can‚Äôt enjoy certain things anymore, etc. Understand that it‚Äôs part of the process. Weed is a hard habit to kick, both mentally and physically, and you need to be forgiving of yourself when you struggle. You may become irritable or experience other side effects, but remember that they are only temporary. You will return to your old self in time. Being kind to yourself also means taking care of your body: get sleep, make healthy choices in your diet, lift some weights, and get those 5-10k steps per day. You‚Äôd be surprised at the difference it makes. 

* **Prune your social media of triggers**. When I was actively smoking, I followed weed influencers online, subscribed to weed subreddits, regularly looked at my friends‚Äô sc/insta stories of them smoking, etc. Seeing this stuff every day in and out is going to make it so much harder to quit. Unfollow people, mute their stories, do whatever it takes for you to make sure you can live every day without being bombarded with weed content. I think stoners often convince themselves that everyone is smoking as a means of validating the habit, but it‚Äôs just not the case. The easiest days for me are days when I simply don‚Äôt even remember that weed exists :)

* **Lastly, take it one day at a time**. Progress is not going to be linear. Furthermore, it‚Äôs hard to even define what ‚Äúprogress‚Äù really is.

I litterally only speak to my partner and direct family  about my addictions and and hopes for future change, 
Thankful that I can reach out to them but I have seen them really struggled with supporting me. And they are all smokers too.

I feel it has and is continuing to strip me of my life.. what it could be..the best version of me.

I've lived in remote communities where it has been unfortunately easy to hide my severe dependency 
Im 26 years old this Sat, was talking to my partner this morning about how it would be nice to smoke less on my birthday!! Every year my birthday comes back around I'm disappointed with myself for who I am. 
A pothead with bugger all social life - and the fact that I'm still smoking.. 
I've now been smoking for more of my life than not!
My poor lungs! 

Unfortunately those unknown confuse me with someone that goes to the gym (if they knew the crap I cough up and sweat!)
My metabolism has spead up over the years, I've lost all the healthy weight I use to carry.. watching my figure turn into those nimble smokers.

Over time I stopped eating properly, in fact at all just smoking mixes for nearly lunch and dinner.. while I was still working in a stressful environmental trying to support others.
Lost control , turned into an alcoholic drinking spirits heavily as well as a pot head.
I've finally managed to cut out the drinks! (After recovering from some very low places) 
I want to do the same with smoko, it has control of my confidence, courage, sense of being and so much more.
I've been out of work for 4 months,  was fulltime before hand.. I worry that my mental and physical health isn't up for the work place again.. and it's going to take a alot of time and patience to reverse the unhealthy lifestyle my mind and body is use to after so long. I know it will be worth it. I'll have made a positive impact on myself at last!!! 
I've read over so many of the posts and related to nearly all of them! doesn't matter what age or gender they're coming from... it's a great shame that there isn't more in person support for this, so very thankful to you all for being out there and reaching out too!

I'm curious. I'm over a year clean from pot and 6 months from everything else.

However, to be perfectly honesty, I want to drink beer again and I want to trip as well. I'm very conflicted right now because I feel fucking brainwashed by AA.

Did my alcohol consumption go up when I was drinking but not smoking? Yes. Did I start drinking more high octane things? Yes. Was it a problem? I don't know.

I'm feeling resentful of AA because frankly I don't consider myself an alcoholic. But I go to so many AA meetings, and I say hi my name is arhombus and I'm an addict and alcoholic that I almost believe it now.

Didn't know any other subreddit to post this to, thought i'd find people with most experience about this topic here.

I started smoking weed 3 years ago, because my 2 best friends started too, and I didn't want to be left out. Since then I've been smoking every day and today, after 1 week of smoking, I came to realisation that that's when all my problems began.

I remember I would always be more social, would always have girls around, would have no problem hanging out with people I just met and make small talk and keep conversations without things being awkward. Now it's been 8 months without a girl, I don't have the motivation to try to find one, and that's because I'm so afraid to go out with a stranger or spark up a convo with someone that I avoid it in any way possible. I also seem to have lost my sense of humor? If that makes sense. I used to be fun to hang out with, now I think I'm boring, or I don't find anything interesting enough to comment on it.

Also my memory fucking sucks, I went to see a movie with one of my friends and it's like I never saw it, I have to think really hard to remember stuff from the movie, I can't even remember if I was paying attention to it or not. 

I'm now 7 days since I've smoked any weed, I never craved it or anything throughout my 3 years, I'd smoke only if my friends smoked but I'd never initiate it, last 3 days I went out for drinks with friends and had a really great time, today I feel like shit and I couldnt bring myself to go out with this girl I've been talking because I thought she'd have a terrible time with me.

I just want to be my old self again, will quitting help? Is there anyone here with similar experiences?

I used to be a heavy drinker but finally quit that which was good, but replaced it with weed. I told myself it was okay because I'm so much less destructive on weed than I was drunk, plus it's cheaper. I spent $200 a month on weed but probably at least that every week on booze. Of course I know I only replaced one addiction with another even though one was way more destructive. 

While quitting weed isn't nearly as hard for me as booze, the thing I miss the most is working out high. When I quit drinking I lost about 50lbs and started working out 6 days a week about 5 years ago. It's something I love and look forward to and I rarely miss a day. I almost always worked out high. It helped me focus and concentrate on my workouts, and now I feel something is missing.

I was smoking at least 4 joints everyday, using it to mask some stresses and issues that I have since been strong enough to face. We‚Äôll call that period a break, because after about 3 months I started smoking again.

At first I had control (or what I thought), once a week was my limit. Once a week turned to weekends, an uncontrolled binge. Weekends turned to evenings and evenings worked well when I had to go to the office all day. But as lockdown hit and I‚Äôm working from home, picking up grams turned into picking up ounces. And ounces meant smoking all day again, because with that amount of weed in my possession I couldn‚Äôt possibly think about anything else.

Went through an ounce in 10 days. Then picked up half an ounce and smoked it in 5. This went on and on for 3 months. Let‚Äôs just say my smoking drawer is full of baggies. Withdrawal hit me again when my dealer couldn‚Äôt get to me for 2 days. I was a mess. Anxious, constantly checking my phone, agitated, angry, emotional, demotivated, couldn‚Äôt focus and mixed in with all of that, ashamed. Ashamed that I‚Äôd let myself down with playing with the very fire that burnt me before. So I started tapering my usage.

I‚Äôd gotten down to just smoking weekends again before staying with family in my hometown to attend the funeral of a family member that sadly passed to Covid-19. I don‚Äôt smoke around family or let them see me stoned because they don‚Äôt agree with smoking weed, so I respect that. I noticed some minor withdrawal, nothing that came close to what I‚Äôd experienced before (a relief to be honest, this was one of the main reasons I‚Äôd tapered usage). That being said, I‚Äôve had bursts of anger and I‚Äôve upset the people I love the most with the way that I‚Äôve exploded about some incredibly minor things. I know it‚Äôs the withdrawal that has contributed to that, it‚Äôs text book for me.

So here we are, 2 years on from my original post. I‚Äôve decided that smoking is something I‚Äôd like to leave in the past. It feels different this time. I don‚Äôt feel any resistance to quitting, I don‚Äôt have an urge to smoke and I feel at peace with the idea of leaving my smoking days behind.

So I've been a chronic smoker for about 7 years on and off again. Early on it wasn't a daily thing for sure, but it git there eventually. I really felt like it had very positive effects for me anxiety and just being able to relax and have fun which wasn't  a normal thing.

I got diagnosed with adhd in 2017 and everything kind of clicked for me. I realized I was self medicating a ""ring of fire"" type adhd and it was helping me balance very extremely UP moments by giving me a safe place from them.

Fast forward to this year I started to develop the chs sickness and after eliminating things from my lifestyle came to the conclusion that it was the cannabis(absolutely great thanks) and had to stop. That was a couple of months ago that I've stopped with definelty a few relapses. Actually a lot of relapses, but for the most part stayed off it. The most recent being this last weekend, because I felt I deserved a reward for replacing the sink faucet that had been not working for a couple of months.


Well here's my problem since I haven't been smoking I've gone back to having a lot of anxiety and a lot of UP time. In a way I would describe it as kind of chewing up my soul. My upness and inability to relax has developed into constant latent frustration which has developed into bitterness which has developed into me feeling like someone who is hateful. I would've never described myself in that way before and it's really taken a toll on me as well my relationship. 

Me and my wife have been fighting a lot. It's really sad, but it's kind of out of my control. She is not innocent in the fights either so it's not just me so it is creating a situation in which I don't really know what to do. She thinks it's all related to the weed which I feel like me not smoking for months and then smoking for 3 days and not smoking for a week after would not leave me feeling this way, but I really don't know. Also as well as I've had a stretch of a month not smoking and I still felt this way and we still fought.

 I'm kind of thinking it's related to adhd and medicine, which is kind of new as well.

My real question I guess is how long until I start to feel normal again? Anyone self medicating adhd with cannabis might have similar experiences and willing to share. I'm really going through pain right now.

It has me feeling like I'm just going to go back to weed and deal with the chs, which is very hard to imagine, but I have to do something.

I was pretty straight edge growing up, I never really drank alcohol or smoked weed until I turned 17. In high school, I did not feel the immense ramifications of marijuana considering I was a senior when I started and at that time, weed was illegal and tough to get a hold of, so my smoking opportunities were limited albeit possible with some maneuvering. that was one aspect of Smoking that I liked actually, the adventure one needed to take in order to smoke in the first place. 
Flash forward and now I‚Äôm 24, weed is legal and easily available in California, and that sense of adventure to procure weed has been replaced by a highly consumerist means of procurement. 
Through the years I‚Äôve noticed that weed has pros and cons, but habitual use heavily makes the cons outweigh any pros. 
Here is a list of things I consider cons through my nearly nonstop smoking years:
-being content with boredom
-being content with the bare minimum of effort put into ones work
-overall lethargic attitudes about life
-difficulty in following through with daily goals 
-anti social tendencies
-agitation and being rude to people because you are high (particular wrong when you are that way to people that love you)
-inability to make eye contact
-sometimes it can have a negative affect on your libido
-lower self confidence
-difficulty in recognizing who the real you is through the haziness of being high
-increased anxiety and paranoia
-poor sleep and lack of dreams in some cases
-lack of clarity and living in your own subjective universe which can cloud your view on your surroundings negatively
-AKA too heavily introspective 
-memory suffers at least temporarily 
-speech suffers 
-money constantly being spent on weed (imagine how much you could save if you stopped buying all that weed!)
-the constant feeling of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù as in ‚Äúwhat if I was not smoking, can you imagine how amazing things would be?!‚Äù 

Of course there are some pros, but I consider these pros only when smoking is not habitual:
-increased clarity (yes weed can make you feel clear about things too)
-can be a good means of decompression from long stretches of hard work

I don't know exactly, because every time I wanted to end I was counting every minute and relapsed anyway. F* that. I was smoking weed for about 7,8 years. I am 24 years old.

I would like to share my experience how I managed to quit, this time hopefully for real. I know it's not gonna be suitable for everyone, but it might be helpful for some people.

If you like to run, try google and watch some videos from David Goggins, you can read his book or listen to some podcasts. He is absolute beast and he motivated me to prepare for a half marathon, which is happening in 2 months. I used to be an athlete, long jump and short runs, quit 6 years ago. Goggins is the example of someone who was at absolute bottom and became one of the hardest people in the world.

8 days is so far the longest time I lasted without weed in the past few years. 
Now I run almost everyday, feel motivated as never before and I rarely think about cigarettes or weed. I just don't care about it at all.

80,2020-06-28 06:18:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hhc2cq/52_hours_and_counting/,52 hours and counting.,"Hi everyone, I never thought I‚Äôd be posting here after a few year of lurking, but here I am. I just turned 40 years old, and have been smoking pretty consistently for about 20 years. I live in Alaska, where MJ is legal - stores everywhere - but even before legalization it seemed like Alaska was the place to be as a smoker. I‚Äôve had intermittent breaks over the past 20 years - some willing and some somewhat forced - the longest lasting about 3 months or so. But I always went back to it. 

I remember at the beginning when smoking was so enjoyable, so exciting in a way, relieving me of my social anxiety and overactive thought processes, but that changed a long time ago and yet I‚Äôve been unable to abstain for any significant amount of time. I feel as if being a smoker had left me a shell of a person, almost like I have downloadable personalities to choose from to fit a given situation, but none of them truly me. I‚Äôve never considered myself a heavy smoker - an eighth would last me about 5 days to a week, but with marijuana here topping 25% THC, I suppose it was a lot. At least too much for me. 

I‚Äôve always suffered from variable moods, a darkness inside of me, a feeling like I never truly fit in anywhere, and about a year and a half ago started seeing a psychiatrist. And of course I downplayed my habit, minimizing it, not admitting that the first thing I would do when I got home from work was to light up. But that‚Äôs what I did. And so many broken weekend promises to myself - ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt smoke until nighttime, I‚Äôm not going to smoke because I‚Äôll be visiting my parents later, etc, etc, etc, blah blah blah.‚Äù And 97% of the time, those promised were broken. 

My visits to the psychiatrist led me to be diagnosed with three thing - persistent depressive disorder, generalize anxiety, and panic disorder without agoraphobia. I fully admitted to the doc that I thought my MJ use was doing me no favors with my mental health, but he held off on a fourth diagnoses, marijuana use disorder. Knowing that it‚Äôs bad for me, but continuing to use. 

With the COVID situation, I‚Äôve been working from home for the past 3.5 months, which is now my permanent situation, and I‚Äôve found myself unable to finish my work day without loading a bowl in the afternoon. And guess what - I don‚Äôt get much work done after that. My job is pretty demanding, requiring strong analytical and writing skills, things I‚Äôve always been good at, but this situation has allowed my performance to deteriorate to the point that I need to fess up to my superiors and admit to the things I haven‚Äôt stayed on top of. I feel like a failure. 

Getting stoned is no longer enjoyable. Hours pass by both slowly and at the speed of light, all while I‚Äôm glued to the couch, staring at the TV, having no real idea of what I‚Äôm watching, and certainly not absorbing any of it. I‚Äôm a smart guy, 140 IQ, and I feel like I have wasted years of my life, with very few meaningful relationships. When I‚Äôve had a partner, I would abstain at the beginning, but my use would resume and escalate. And I would become a withdrawn, irritable, and hopeless POS. 

So, I‚Äôve decided to quit again. Just passed the 48 hour mark, and I‚Äôm actually feeling pretty good, except for trouble sleeping, crazy dreams, and a lack of appetite. But I know I can get through this, and reading your stories motivate me and help me so much. I want to regain the affable, charismatic, and caring guy I once was, and know I can be again. I feel that marijuana has taken my soul, sold it to the devil, and left me empty. Hopeless. Depressed. Unworthy of my accomplishments. Those feelings need to go away. 

Even after two days of abstinence, I can feel things coming back. I‚Äôve already been more productive these past couple of days than I have been in a long time, more engaged, and feeling lighter than I have in a long time. I want these feelings to continue growing, and I know the only way to achieve that is to banish cannabis from my life for good. I know it‚Äôs achievable, especially with the support of all of you. Thank you for sharing your stories, your struggles, your achievements. I know I can get through this with your support, and from what I‚Äôve seen of this sub, it‚Äôs there for me if I‚Äôm willing to accept it. Please wish me luck!",19,1

I‚Äôve been sober for a week after smoking every day for 2-3 years. I started smoking through offerings from acquaintances and friends at parties, which eventually spiralled into a full-blown addiction. I never intended to become hooked, and I never realised how much it effected by daily functioning. I suffer with anxiety and depression after numerous traumatic events, and found weed as the only solace and respite from my problems. 

In the short-term, it helped tremendously. I‚Äôd get anxious or depressed, I‚Äôd break down and cry, cut myself for distraction, attempt suicide with no success, which eventually led to the reliance on weed as a treatment. My perception of life was skewed, I had no sense of self-confidence or pride. I was lonely, lost in the jungle that is life. Every medication failed, every counselling session felt pointless, meditation seemed maladaptive, friends and family felt distant. The chaos in my head was underpinned by the chaos I experienced in life. I felt like I had no control of my life; my actions, my feelings, my social network. Weed was the only thing that seemed constant. The weed-induced memory loss worked to my advantage, I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the abysmal past events that constantly swirled through my head. I had something I could look forward to after 8 hours of reality.

In the long-term, I deeply regret ever starting. I lost so many important people in my life due to my distance. I reserved myself from life. I felt as if I was completely dissociated from my body, as if there was another personality acting during the day and the ‚Äòreal‚Äô me was high at night. I avoided parties and other social gatherings because it disrupted my daily smoking schedule. I stopped interacting with my parents because the time I spent with them could‚Äôve been spent getting high. I lost motivation to study, to clean, to live a real life. I was an outsider to my own existence. 

After a couple years, I realised that the dissociation I felt wasn‚Äôt a problem with me, but rather a problem caused by smoking. I attempted to quit numerous times, only to feel anxious and depressed and then relapse. But I am not going to relapse again. 

3 weeks ago, I began exercising for 20 minutes and meditating for 10 minutes a day. Through that, I found an internal power of control over my thoughts and feelings. I found a way to reconstruct traumatic memories. I found a new treatment, with no side effects, with no price, with no 17% THC content.

A week ago, I finished the last of my kief and decided it was finally time to stop avoiding my deeply rooted problems with a misperceived ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô. A week ago, I found the courage and strength that was hidden by the weed-induced fog in my brain. I now realise how much I‚Äôve missed in life from smoking; how many opportunities I said no to, how many friends I let down and unintentionally caused harm to, how much knowledge I could‚Äôve attained in that time. 

I realise now that addiction isn‚Äôt just another mental experience, but rather a symptom of repressed trauma, of loneliness and maladaptive perceptions. The biological mechanisms of addiction are just our bodies adjusting to the regular intake of a specific molecule.  The biological aspect of addiction can be overcome in a short period, but the deeply rooted emotional problems we avoid take time to heal. 

You have to give yourself time. You have to put in energy and effort to quit. It‚Äôs not easy. But you‚Äôve come to this subreddit for a reason. You‚Äôve started the healing process. You‚Äôve acknowledged the problem, now it‚Äôs time to act. Throw away your weed, telling yourself you‚Äôll quit after this bag is a lie. Reach out for help. You can do this.

I‚Äôm so happy to have randomly come across this community on my own while randomly looking for answers. I‚Äôve been using an app called I Am Sober to log & to post but it just doesn‚Äôt seem as raw as the genuine humans on here. So, as everyone knows, quarantine set in for most of the world in February/March. For me, in the US, I was out of work & in quarantine by mid-March. I had no weed. I never smoked daily or chronically, never used it to cover up any mental health issues or underlying health conditions! However, my buddy who sold dab cartridges for vapes was easily accessible to me (he lived fairly close). I started smoking the oils almost daily towards the end of March, into April, and finally one day, I wasn‚Äôt getting high anymore. I tried taking the strongest hit from my pen & ended up in a coughing fit that resulted in my left side cramping up, mainly spooking me. I went cold turkey, and have been sober for about 8 weeks. I went through withdrawals for about 5 of those weeks, and now am currently feeling like I‚Äôm facing a final stage of symptoms. Most of them have come back in random waves. Yet, mentally I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in the same place as the first weeks where everything just seemed fucking terrifying. I do feel confident & strong this will pass easily. So I‚Äôm wondering.. for someone who didn‚Äôt smoke daily before until recently, but DID smoke high potencies.. is it possible for someone like me to only face the motions again (PAWS) for a relatively short-time? I workout regularly & keep myself concentrated with gaming & other things. I currently face some GI issues (loose stool, not as bad as before), muscle twitches, random lightheadedness/dizziness, some headaches, & randomly my stomach will twitch or get numb. I‚Äôm 21.

The second week was by far my favourite although not really anything to celebrate but I was getting these lucid dreams and they were so crazy it actually gave me a bit of enjoyment. Something I hadn‚Äôt felt in forever dreaming. I had a few cravings but I was still very motivated so it was never an issue for me to want to smoke or anything. 

This week however has been sucky, I‚Äôve had mouth pains, body aches, random headaches, nausea. I haven‚Äôt exactly felt like smoking or had many cravings although it does pop into my brain every now and then but I‚Äôm confident right now I don‚Äôt want to smoke. Emotionally I have been ok. A little up and down but I can deal with it. 

Although the last week was quite sucky, I do however feel positive that things will get better, I know they will because I read all the posts on here and we all go through the same pain.

I work weird hours-- some days my shift starts at 9am and some days I go in at 6pm. On those evening shift days, I'll wake up around 8am as usual, eat breakfast, then go back to sleep until 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon.

I'm not particularly lethargic or irritable when I do have to get up in the morning, but when I don't, I feel listless and depressed. Things I once enjoyed, like playing video games, guitar, TV, etc. leave me bored after just a few minutes, and all I can think of to do is go back to sleep. 

Additionally, I have barely noticed any cognitive improvements at all. I don't lose my train of thought or completely forget what I was talking about, like I did when stoned. But I still struggle with basic mental math or remembering several things at once while working.

The person who gave up weed in February didn't live in a world half shut down by Covid 19, didn't live in a world where the gyms were closed or seeing friends and family was not allowed. Didn't forsee any of this happening, who did? But the person who exists today has made it through ALL of her hardest days so far. Will make it through tomorrow if it's hard, and the next day if it continues to be hard.

Weed used to be an escape for me. A fast forward button. But it didn't actually do either thing in reality. If anything, it placed me on permanent pause while everyone else was out there living life and I was just stuck, still, existing in my own little bubble and nothing else. Existing not living.

Quitting weed was just one of many things I needed to do to fix things but now that's done it's that place of ""what now?"" and ""why isn't everything better?"" The reality is, for me I wouldn't have fallen so far down the hole if things had been better to start with. Now I've put down the shovel I need to work on walking away from those holes or filling them in. Permanently.

This unknown territory of wanting to move forward after being stuck for so long is both terrifying and overwhelming at times. Part of me wants to flash forward and be where I need to be right now cos that'd be easier but that's the exact mindset that got me into addiction in the first place. That wanting a shortcut. There are no shortcuts in life. Not really. I had to sweat, cry, not sleep, vomit and shake for days to get through that first week of recovery. I couldn't skip that so why is this part any different right? 

So what IS next? Well it's been a long time since I've wanted weed. Maybe 2 months? I don't think about it, crave it, and when it does pop into my head my thoughts are ""that's not for me, not anymore, that's not who I am or how I want to feel these days"" which to me seems insane. I'm not naive, I know I'll always have to be on my guard, can never be complacent, can NEVER have just one puff, one joint BUT, it no longer rules my life. So now that's under control I need to move forward. Need to go back to that discomfort again. 

Quitting weed is VERY uncomfortable. It's reaching into the unknown, it's physical and mental anguish. I made it through that, I can make it through whatever is next. Which is to thrive. I want to thrive. Instead of existing. I want to be what I'm worth rather than what I think I am worth which is much less after years of self abuse and hopelessness. I want to give back even though in reality due to my circumstances and personality I've actually taken little from others. Too closed off for that. 

Time to move on. Grow up. Get uncomfortable again. I'm tired of being a bonsai tree, restricted by a pot too small. Unable to grow bigger, stronger roots so I can can push upwards and maybe, one day, bloom.

At this point I pretty much only think about weed when I see posts from this sub lol. It's been several months now where it's not on my mind at all, and that's probably the biggest release for me. Even better than being clearheaded, better than not having to lie to people and isolate myself, is just the mental freedom of not thinking about getting high.

I still read stories here and comment because I'm still learning from you all, thank you so much for sharing your experiences. I know for example that I should not try to use again after I've been clean for awhile and make the mistake of thinking I can regulate use. Deep down I know I can't, but I probably would have lied to myself because this is the longest period of time I've been sober since I was 17, and I'm 34 now. I'm literally still learning what it's like to be a sober person, I was a kid before.

I also learned to be attuned to how other substances might affect me while quitting, which is why I chose to stop drinking very soon after quitting weed. I never had an alcohol issue, didn't even keep it around the house, but the few times I drank after stopping weed I could feel the temptation of that kind of mental release. So I just set it aside. I'm going to the beach with family this week (isolated location, everyone quarantining in preparation, so we should be safe from the rona lol), and I know I'm going to be strong enough to turn down booze and weed alike. They will meet the sober me for pretty much the first time.

If you're lurking here wondering if it's your time to quit, you came to the right place. Try it for a few weeks and see how you feel. If you've can get access to someone, get support from a therapist. Once you've got it out of your system and you're feeling some clarity, then you can decide if quitting is something you want to do.

some history: started smoking at 19 irregularly in college. also had a drinking problem that made me drop out temporarily at 20. when i moved back home i started smoking pretty regularly and did so until i was about 22 when my parents were tipped off by an older sibling and they told me to cut it out. i didn't smoke for about a year and had no symptoms from withdrawals except being bored the 1st 2 weeks without it.

i met my boyfriend at 23 and we both were smokers who weren't smoking and that suited us fine for about a half a year. he went away to europe for school for half a month, and since it was my first relationship, i was pretty sad without him. so i hit up a coworker that i knew smoked and started it back up again. my bf got back from europe, started smoking with me, and we have been daily smokers for a little over 3 years now.

i did quit about 2 years ago for a month when i was getting tested for a job, and that was my first experience with noticeable withdrawal symptoms. depression, stomach issues (which triggered a very bad relapse of an eating disorder i've struggled with), and horrible insomnia. i don't know if any of these went away on their own before i started smoking again, so i've never really successfully detoxed from weed.

now, fast forward to binge smoking in quarantine (having switched from bud to pens & dabs about 2 years ago), and my anxiety even while smoking was starting to get bad. i am also a nicotine vaper and both of those combined were zapping my energy & making me horribly paranoid and anxious. so i decided to cut back about a week ago on both substances.

3 days into barely smoking and i started getting heart palpitations which sent my already bad anxiety into a downward spiral. i tried smoking flower to see if it would help, and it just sent me into a huge panic attack. i ended up having my bf drive me to the E.R. because i was conviced i was going to have a heart attack with how irregularly and quickly my heart was beating. of course, all the tests and xrays showed i was fine and i was released.

im 4 days off of that E.R. visit and i still have some palpitations every once in a while. i've noticed they only happen when i get a random anxiety attack and my heart races. these anxiety attacks are pretty regular--i am more anxious during the day than not, and the periods of reprieve are very short (maybe 30 seconds to 2 minutes if im lucky).

ive suffered from panic attacks, anxiety, and depression since childhood so i'm sure that has something to do with these symptoms. it's just very disconcerting to be experiencing this level of anxiety and paranoia everyday (for only 4 days, i know, but it feels like an eternity when youre afraid youre going to die 5 times a day). i know quitting nicotine on top of weed probably is not helping any (i also stupidly decided to start weaning off of my ssri.... my paranoia is making me afraid to take any substances or eat anything that may be ""contaminated"" that could hurt me, idk, i know it's stupid).

anyways, i guess i just wanted to vent to people who may understand what i'm going through, as my boyfriend is still continuing his usage (which is fine) and just playing video games & vibing as usual. i do have other symptoms that are bothering me (stomach upset & moodswings), but none of them hold a candle to the anxiety & chest discomfort (palpitations, tightness, racing heart), and i would give anything to get rid of it.

at least there is no chance of me relapsing, since smoking also gives me panic attacks now.. but all of this has been making me think about finding a way to get ahold of some other substances for the anxiety, which i know is bad for me as a person with addiction problems... idk. i guess i just want to know that it gets better for anyone who's struggled with similar symptoms to mine and that i can do it without picking up another addiction.

**TL;DR - 4 days sober, experiencing horrible anxiety, heart palpitations, and panic attacks. any advice/experience anecdotes appreciated.**

They feel so real to the point i actually start to feel bad/guilty in my dream that ive relapsed. Even after i wake up, takes me a moment to realise that i havent, followed by relief. 

I've done a lot of walking since quitting, couple miles a day (Adding to 48 in one week) This is very good for your state of mind, long walks keep you busy and tire you out. If your someone who was smoking tobacco i highly recommend you try to walk at least a mile or two, while the weather is nice. This will help you clear your lungs, settle your mind and start strengthening your legs/body to gradually include other exercise (If that's the route your taking) A healthy body helps heal the mind in my experience. 

The best thing about walking is that its dubbed the ""recovery exercise"" - If you keep it somewhat comfortable you can do it day after day *you just need to make the time for it.* Dont set a target of miles, set a target of leaving your house and going for a walk outside in the fresh air. That's it.

Other than that, i am starting to crave. I got rid of everything i was using to smoke to make it harder for myself to start smoking again. I dont mean to sound self-righteous in my advice, i'm posting in the hopes that someone reading this will find it useful. If your thinking of smoking - Dont.

Some background - 22, M., been smoking semi-regularly for about 6-7 years now... was definitely daily for weeks/months at times. I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, after recognizing for years that my mental health was on an increasing decline. Looking back, I think self-medicating with cannabis was one of the only ways my mind felt ""still"", and thus better able to focus and tap into my creative side, etc... However, it also would often come at the price of something anywhere between mild anxiety and paranoia to severe existential dread, at even the lowest dosages. Also, I notice that it further hinders my ADHD brain's ability to make rational and healthy choices, and creates a disconnect from my spiritual nature. 
Long story short, I've known for years that weed simply isn't for me, but I've always struggled to keep it out of my life. 


One key, for me, lately, is that I'm slowly starting to develop an understanding of the value of regular mindfulness practice. I've always ""known"" that meditation/mindfulness is helpful, and I definitely do think it is sometimes overemphasized as bestowing ""magical"" susceptibilities, but I can honestly say that it's at least helping. It feels like a decent start.

Normally, I'd probably fall into a (disturbingly comforting) loop of never-ending panic and anxiety. By striving to simply observe my sentiments upon consuming, I was better able to articulate my thoughts about how it feels, and reflect on why exactly I'm trying to quit.

I haven't posted in a while as I haven't been focusing on weed so much. It really does help. I always loved to see a timeline, so here is mine for the first month.

Week 1: horrible anxiety, depression, headaches, general uncomfortableness, lack of appetite, everything is fucking boring, insomnia. Although I had the longest list of symptoms in the first week, I found that you also have this boost of energy from deciding to quit.

Week 2: anxiety, headaches, uncomfortableness, appetite came back somewhat, could easily get to sleep but still woke up once during the night. For me, this week past quite quickly as I found a new love of walking my dog and listening to podcasts. However, I quickly figured out that not having anything really to do (no job because of covid, and waiting for 2nd semester of uni) really just ignites the fire in you to smoke weed. Find something to do.

Week 3: HEADACHES, less anxiety, found a new love in tv-shows, appetite fully back, have some good mf sleeps yay. However. This honestly was in my head the worst week. I did have constant headaches during the week which nothing really could solve, also because I felt pretty much sober, my mind started playing the whole 'you can smoke just once to have a good night', but I fought it off, because I knew that it would just ruin my progress and wouldn't actually help me with the headaches etc, in the long run. But it did drive me to relapse on cigarettes, went through 2 packs in about a week and a half, realised what I was doing and my lungs started hurting again, and stopped that again.

Week 4: Life. I'm pretty sure I'm technically at Week 5ish now but I'll just use this to tell you where I'm at. In 2 days I'm getting a tattoo with money that I'd never have if I was smoking weed still. I still get headaches here and there but they can be solved now. A big part of it was staring at screens. I do look through r/leaves every now and again, but I feel as though once you feel pretty good but you are just tackling cravings and boredom, its best not to focus on weed at all and just try and ignore, which has helped me. But let me tell you, I needed this sub during the first 3 weeks like every hour. Now I don't really focus on what day/week/month I'm at and check it every two or three days or so but I don't focus on it. That's why I can tell you I'm over a month (milestone) but not the exact day.

We can all do it. I thought I'd never get past my last attempt of 5 days, and that only made my anxiety worse. But I'm here now, still feeling bored and useless, but that's because I don't have anything to do at the moment, and because I know that is the reason why I'm feeling this way I know turning to weed isn't the right idea. Much love everyone. <3",7,1

So I wanted to share my journey...,"Hey everyone, around this time 2 years ago I finally quit smoking weed and it's probably the best decision I've ever made. No contest. I feel like it's taken me these 2 years to get back in tune with myself and I feel so much more in control of my mind. Not to mention that feeling my brain fog clear is an awesome feeling.

Writing and journaling helped me cope with those depressing and paranoid states of mind when I was going through it after I quit and it got me thinking... weed gets glamourised so much in music and no one really cares to speak about the darker sides of the experience.

So... I decided to make a track. And talk on how I REALLY felt when smoking. Talking on things I WISH I heard when I first decided to quit. I hope you can feel the same catharsis as I did and know that cycles can be broken. I wish everyone the best on their journey to quitting for good. Never lose hope.

I am on day 6 and experiencing some horrible symptoms pain wise (my fibro is flaring up horribly and I am getting migraines), I'm having issues sleeping...and up until today I was doing decently emotionally but today I woke up in a fit of rage...just super agressive and hateful towards myself and people who don't deserve it..which later turned into extreme despair and hopelessness. I self harmed for the first time in 5 years and I am just all around freaking out.... I don't know what to do. All I want to do is run right back to pot... is it even worth it?

I downloaded the app I Am Sober and checked in every day for 4 months. I felt amazing. My husband quit with me and I was so proud of us. But we didn't fully set ourselves up for success. We had just bought a bag a few days before quitting and for whatever reason, we couldn't just ""waste"" it all when we quit so we held on to it. About two months ago, my husband and I were both laid off and quarantined and having a camp fire and I thought ""this would be a nice time to smoke"". So we did, ""just this once"". That one time spiraled out of control pretty quickly and wouldn't ya know it, within 2 weeks we were back to smoking every day. Shit.   


I've felt a lot of mixed emotions about this setback and never felt right about resetting my I Am Sober app. I opened it today, out of random curiosity, and there it was - my would-be milestone. I would have been 6 months sober today. But I chose a different road instead. I genuinely thought that after quitting for 4 months we could become casual, infrequent smokers. I now know that we cannot. I would have been 6 months sober today but instead I'm back at day one. I've realized that ""I would have been"" feels like shit, it is my new motivator.

Obviously thats because its Friday and Friday and Saturday were always the days I could ""let loose"" and basically smoke to my hearts content. Annoyed by this I reminded myself why I am doing this and that the more Fridays I get through the less this will be an issue.

Thinking back to my childhood I can remember when it being Friday was enough. I'd be happy the weekend had arrived and looked forward to those Saturday morning cartoons and whatever tree house building or woods exploring I had planned for the weekend. Clearly that would have continued into my adulthood (replace tree house building and woods exploring with something appropriate for an adult though haha) and I've missed out on just being happy about life without the unnatural flood of dopemine and whatever other neurochemicals weed threw at my brain. At some point in the future I hope to experience that again and not have weed on my mind.

Today was my first day. It's now 5 in the morning, and I can't sleep. I've had the occasional day or two of being dry, and sleep is always the worst thing.

That, and having zero appetite. All I had to eat today were two pickles. When I get up, I'll probably end up forcing yogurt down my throat.

I started smoking when I was 16, now 18, and am starting to notice how weed has messed me up. It ruined the relationship I had with family members, including my parents, and led me to try Molly and LSD.

I've gone into my brother's house, and stole his dabs. I've probably stolen $300 worth of weed from him, including an old nectar and torch. I've stolen money from my parents to feed my addiction as well. All of them eventually caught me, but it took my brother catching me three times to stop.

I hate who I have become. I used to have dreams and passion. Now I've just graduated high school with no job, and no plan to go to college. I've barely even been looking for a job. And if I did get a job, I'd probably just start smoking more than I already do (gram of dabs a day).

I feel like a complete failure, and I'm trying to do what I know is best, but I don't think I'll make it. Lately I just feel helpless, and I don't think I'll ever make it in this world. I don't even have the motivation to follow my passion anymore.

I'm sorry for the lengthy post, just trying to get things off my mind so I can get a bit of sleep. Thanks for reading.",1,0

I‚Äôve built a life around weed. But at least the last year I‚Äôve wanted to quit with failure as I didn‚Äôt have the right plan. I was using moderation techniques, abstaining before work and just kept it a night and weekend thing. Almost always a few weeks in, I‚Äôd feel sorry for how hard I‚Äôve been working perhaps feeling quite sore and think that I‚Äôm about to reward myself by smoking before work. This is the real problem as That one instance that took you all of twenty seconds to pack a bowl, that one fat rip, and boom my mindset, pattern of thinking and emotional state is all altered. For the better I‚Äôd tell myself. Almost always however the temporary relief quickly fades and turns into anxiety. There I must live for the rest of the day. My Motto will be similar to that of another user who stated that the anxiety would often come in as a result of the smoking. However the anxiety that crept in on a craving is easily avoidable once the craving subsided and another task is engaged. I feel I use weed to cope with many things. But today I‚Äôm taking a stand yet again. Yesterday I called off work and remained idle. I relapsed and smoke several bowls within a few hours but didn‚Äôt smoke at night. First step in the weening process. Here it is Friday morning and I don‚Äôt recommend this but I called out today as well to make another go of it. Work keeps me busy and I have a passion for what I do which is tree work ironically. Most folks smoke during work as we are cutting on tres running chainsaws. Crazy I know but when it‚Äôs the day to day it‚Äôs just another day at work. My path today is to be as busy and productive as possible without entering any space that includes weed. Fortunately we are in the time of corona and my boss doesn‚Äôt mind if I take time off with that said I may have to go get tested as she thinks I may be coming down with a case of the stuff. Lol whatever works. I learned I need to keep trying, stay busy, keep my distance from the ganj. Good luck glad I found this",4,1

Sleeping feels foreign even though I do it every night but never sober.

For starters I 50/50 am able to wake up in the morning. I have a job that I probably shouldn‚Äôt have because I am constantly completely sleeping through alarms, instantly falling back asleep and not remembering I was ever awake, etc. 
ITS NOT NORMAL AND I AM FULLY AWARE AND ASHAMED OF IT. 
But I can‚Äôt stop. If I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt sleep. If I don‚Äôt smoke I get vivid nightmares and wake up in a state of panic or dissociation. There seems to not really be a win.

Long time lurker of this subreddit here.

After 3 years in the depths of horrible depression, multiple attempts to quit and a constant avoidance of life, I've been weed free for a month and I've never felt better. 

I feel like I've lived 3 years of my life in pause but I am done with that. I WANT TO LIVE. 

Right now I feel so good. My head is so clear. I have been trying to learn graphic design and in the past month I've done as much work as I did in a whole year whilst smoking. I see my skills improving so rapidly and I'm just so proud.  My head is clear, I have so many ideas and so many things I want to do and I'm actually doing them. I'm losing weight because no more constant munchies. I've actually cooked so many homemade meals. I even started taking up sewing. After avoiding my mother for months I apologized to her and she accepted me back with open arms. Everything is falling in place. Everything is going well.

I've had to deal with anxiety and all the problems that I was desperately smoking so I could avoid are still there but I feel a bit silly because I am realising they aren't that bad. Smoking just made them that bad.

All this time weed was my safe haven. All this time I thought weed was helping me ""cope"". It didn't. It helped me NOT cope. Weed was like a lazy form of suicide for me. Like I didn't want to die but I didn't want to live life so I was ""dead"" and just hoping things would get better.

I am not writing anything unique. Everyone who quits says the same things. But I am hoping that I give the motivation to someone who needs this by writing this. LIFE IS GREAT WITHOUT BEING HIGH ALL THE TIME. Life's natural high is the best kind of high. You can do this. It's hard but it's worth it so much. Good luck to everyone who is quitting üôè",7,0

I often post in another subreddit known as r/petioles to attempt responsible/reasonable marijuana use permanently but I failed multiple times. (my record tolerance break/""t break"" to date is 59 days from February 15th to April 14th of this year back during the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
 
I smoked weed occasionally in 2011/age 16-17, started every day use in early 2013/age 17-18, then by 2015 around age 19 or 20 it was becoming increasingly problematic continuing into my early 20's. 

My PSYCHOLOGICAL Withdrawal Symptoms; Cravings and Irritability. That's about it. 

My PHYSICAL Withdrawal Symptoms; Restlessness/Nervousness, Insomnia, Shaking/Difficulties Remaining Still, Excessive/Unusual Sweating, Nausea, Vomiting, Dry-Heaving which are rather alarming physical withdrawal symptoms for just marijuana. (I can see for  Meth withdrawals maybe yeah but with only Weed?) It could be from excessive caffeine, but this has happened too in times where I consumed little to no caffeinated beverages nor any alcohol. 

Today I even called my mom and kindly asked if I could borrow $20. She said ""absolutely not"" because she and I both know exactly what I'm going to spend it on (2g of weed)"" My dad and brother would be like lol, fuck off.   

I totally understand/get that and I didn't even argue nor ask again. 

If I was in my moms shoes, and my almost 25/m son called me asking to borrow 20 bucks so they can get booze or dope I wouldn't think twice about telling them to fuck off. 

Having said that, It's still an Uncomfortable Addiction that I have to deal with in my everyday life. 

I tried to treat My Depression tonight by drinking a 4-Pack of 16oz Monster Ultra Voilet Energy Drinks followed by a Liter of Strong Black Coffee and all of this was consumed within about a 90 minute duration (10:45pm-12:15am). 

Abit of a Scary Situation. This has been ongoing probably now for at least five years or so. I usually have a few bong tokes before I go to bed but because I had no weed I wasn't able to sleep.",1,2

I‚Äôm currently on my 4th day of not smoking. These past few days have revealed the true colors of people that I considered close ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.
I‚Äôve taken a break before for roughly 6-7 months when I was enrolled in a workforce development program that drug tested. This was a time of great transformation, self evaluation, and leveling up all around. I landed a full time position at my current place of employment due to this program and the way I carried myself during that time. I also was dating a gorgeous chick I thought was out of my league. But of course I fell victim to this terrible vice. I wound up breaking up with her 6 months in due to just not feeling the same. Hard to tell if it was the weed or her actions. 

My boy from high school who never hits me up to see how I‚Äôm doing or anything continues to text me late as shit at night for weed like I‚Äôm a plug. And tries to make me feel bad for not helping lol. Complete disrespect of my time. He invited me to chill with his boys but the day of, I wasn‚Äôt contacted. No explanation for being ghosted. 

Just ran into somebody I haven‚Äôt seen in a while at the store whom brought up the idea of quitting a while back. He asked if I‚Äôm still smoking and I said ‚Äúnah I‚Äôm like 5 days clean. What happened to you being clean?‚Äù while I was buying lotto tickets. Next thing I know he leaves without saying a word. I‚Äôm guessing he wanted to hear that I was still smoking so that he‚Äôd have a reason to chill with me. 

My closest friend of many years has no motivation to go outside with me to places saying that they‚Äôre too far and that he‚Äôs tired from work when ik damn well it‚Äôs the fucking marijuana. It‚Äôs hard to get him to slide to my house because he wouldn‚Äôt be in control here. He also has asked to borrow money from me far more times than any average man would. When I tell him about his addiction he gets defensive and tells me to get off my high horse. ‚ÄúYou stop for two days and your the guy to be lol‚Äù. Smoking is where the majority of his time went. And it‚Äôs where mine went too, thus me trying to better myself.

I feel like such a different person now that I can't rely on my feelings about experiences that are from memory. In a way, that's exciting... to have different feelings about very familiar situations, but this time it's truly authentic, right?

That said, it's as if this new me cannot handle the clarity. I have such a quick reaction to everything and it's usually not a good one initially. I'm ultra-sensitive and feel blindsided all the fucking time.

And then the shame hits. I grew up in a verbally abusive household, so I thought it was normal behavior to manipulate and fly off the handle. Followed by a bowlful of weed to cope.

I used to think I had patience. I could tolerate most bullshit life threw at me with ease. I'm still very analytical and open-minded about all perspectives, but it feels like I want to be left alone because I'm reacting poorly to almost anything I wasn't expecting. Even things I can prepare myself for somehow freak me out. Like my intuition is no longer a positive trait.

I can't have people relying on me in this state of mind. And I can't actually disappear until I feel better. Most of my interactions I'm referring to I can't disclose, just resort to ""sorry, I'm just not myself.""

Right now‚Äîat this instant‚ÄîI want to celebrate by getting high, but I know the instant moment I inhale that release the regret seeps in. I hate that I can't feel like I am in control of this habit - and I, conceptually, understand that it's only because of the relationship I had cultivated with the drug; how I relied on it when I felt lonley, or bored, or happy, or anxious. But I can't seem to emotionally forgive myself for the negative consequences it has aided in forming (wasted time, relationships, opportunities). And when I feel this negative about who I am on an emotional level, I am consumed with the desire to forget all about it. 

The last week, when I start feeling like this, I have been coming here. Reading the success stories and the experiences of those who, like me, are still right in the very thick of it.

On the month mark, I said to myself, I did really well, I deserve a smoke, but only the one bag, so went and purchased some from my dealer, enjoyed the smoke I won't lie, was marvellous.

Come last week when I run out and had to quit again, all same problems, can't sleep, not hungry, sweaty, all the bad things anyway, but one thing is new this time, that didn't happen last month, the nightmares, (on the occasions I can sleep, basically every other night for a few hours) they are not the typical nightmares you'd say, like monsters or ghosts, but I'm dreaming about bloody tornados ü§£ doesn't sound scary, but they are, very scary, I feel like I'm really there, weird thing is, I live in the UK, which of course, never have these things.

Anyway thought is share my story haha, I will keep grinding, not sleeping, and all this stuff, I feel like it's all getting better slowly anyway, good luck to all of you who want to quit, believe in yourself, I did, and this page helped alot, if any questions I'm happy to help.",5,0

I joined Reddit after stumbling upon r/leaves in a google search.  I've never felt more alone in my life and turned to weed about a year ago to cope. As an aside, I've deal with debilitating depression / anxiety since I was 17 (am now 26). When I smoke, I feel great at first, like all of my problems melt away and things aren't really that big of a deal. But recently, I've noticed that when I'm high I completely ignore texts / friends / activities I used to love. I used to write a lot and since I've started smoking daily, I'm not able to write. The worst part is a few hours after smoking, the panic sets in and usually ends with me coming to the conclusion that I'm worthless and a POS. 

My job is stressful and while I (thankfully) will be in a new job next week, I don't want bad habits following me. I have a feeling they might. I find myself staring at the clock, willing it to hit 5:00pm so I can smoke. What makes me feel even more ashamed is no one knows how bad my habit is. I know that if I'm hiding something like this then it's not good. 

I feel like I'm standing outside my body, watching me waste away my life. But at the same time it's such an easy fix to not deal with anything and smoke instead. I've tried and tried to quit but every time I find an excuse and say ""okay this really is the last time and then I'm done for good."" But then I'm never really done. Addiction runs in my family and I feel deep shame that I couldn't ""overcome it.""

I don't know where to start with quitting for real this time. Is there even a point if I so clearly don't believe that I can do it and the evidence is stacked against me? I've never been one for being able to stick to a commitment so I feel even more lost.

I honestly don't even know what I want to come out of this post, I guess just writing my feelings is cathartic and even if one person reads this and sends good vibes my way, I really appreciate it.",8,0
191,2020-06-25 13:12:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hfpyk8/first_day_clean/,First day clean,"Hey guys. Just reached the end of day 1 of not smoking after 5 years of heavy, everyday smoking (with a few days off here and there but nothing longer than a week since I was 16; am currently 21) and it was so much easier than I expected. Sure there is the slight physical aspect like the fact that I haven't eaten all day and only realized that now, lol, but aside from that I feel pretty great. I don't think weed in itself is necessarily a 'bad drug' so to speak (with regards to the detrimental impact it has on your life), but it can definitely be the catalyst for letting bad habits get the best of you when it's abused. I love Mary dearly and this is not goodbye forever, but the stage that I'm currently at in my life requires me to dedicate a bit of diligence to a cause that'll provide me with personal means of self-sufficiency, and weed is not conducive to the hard work required to do so.

I think that if one is able to have enough self-discipline to only smoke after you've done everything that you need to do and at the very END of the day, it can be used as a very helpful reward mechanism for the successes you've achieved throughout the day. I, however, have a very addictive personality and don't have the self-discipline to wait until the evening to smoke if I have weed (at least at this point in time; that might change in the future). If I have weed, I'll end up waking-and-baking and then resuming to smoke for the rest of the day, and if I don't I'll spend every waking minute contemplating getting high.

This hasn't really done anything to fuck up life yet, but if I carry on at the same rate I fear being 25 and still being financially reliant on my parents (no offense to anyone that is - but that's something I personally cannot live with myself doing). I intend on smoking again only when I have my life, aspirations and work fully in order. With regards to the actual quitting part, as clich√© as it sounds, it is full-blown entirely mind over matter. I went to bed last night knowing that I was not going to smoke today and that it was not going to be difficult. Hence, it was not. It's also very important to keep your mind busy while going off. Quitting weed but remaining idle seems damn-near impossible to me. You have to replace it with healthy coping mechanisms (read a book, play a musical instrument, read articles, listen to plenty of music, work on developing your skill set, LEARN LEARN LEARN - after all, knowledge is power - another personal reason I've felt the need to temporarily distance myself from weed - I am thirsty for knowledge and learning as much as I possibly can about topics that interest me, but when you're high on weed you are content with where you are in life, and there's far less of a desire to learn more, and even if you do, it's a lot harder to learn while high (for me anyway).

I'd like to thank this community for inspiring me to finally take this courageous leap towards sobriety (after many half-hearted attempts), I have been lurking for months and you guys have reassured and motivated me in my decision. I send love and luck to everybody else on the same journey. I'm sure there will be rainy days where I'll be on the brink of ripping my own skin off just to smoke a bit of weed, but those days will pass and it's okay to have days like that because life is about the journey you take to reach the final destination (not the destination itself - lol sorry I am so full of clich√© statements today but it seems applicable haha). The point is, suffering is inevitable during the human experience and sometimes working through that suffering and coming out stronger on the other side will benefit you more in the long run than constantly shutting out and escaping every time life gets a little difficult. Much love.",11,0

And how long were you smoking for before you quit?","I just quit weed after 12 years of everyday smoking and am on day 45 of not taking a hit. The tiniest bit of physical exertion leaves me completely out of breath still whereas while I was still smoking I would have no issues doing the same stuff.

Ex. just had to push a new leesa mattress up the stairs (in box and it slid up fairly easily) and open it up, and felt like I was going to puke afterwards. other day was putting 20 lbs of mulch into a wheelbarrow and dumping it and after 5 bags felt completely sick like I was going to pass out. Yesterday I merely walked from my house to the street to put something in my car and back, and felt a little winded.

Walking on the treadmill is manageable for me, but I don't feel like it's really doing anything. I try to mix jogging in but I get so out of breath so easily that I can only manage to do a few minutes total of jogging but only 1-1.5  minutes at a time mixing it in here and there with the walking

I'm just trying to get a gauge of how long it wil be before I can actually lift weights and exercise properly again, because as it stands right now I feel completely powerless to do so without getting fatigued right away. I know everyone's body is different, but I like to hear success stories. It's insane to me that these symptoms start after smoking and not during, the body is truly mysterious. I feel like whatever my body is going through from this is going to take a few months and I can't fathom looking for a job letting alone working one with all of the random anxiety and fatigue/exhaustion from basic shit.

I never expected to have the irritability, mood swings, insomnia, nausea and cravings that I‚Äôm having.

Feeling a lot better today. Still had a brief pang of anxiety when I woke up but I got up early and went for a walk. Did 2.5k steps before 8:00AM. I would never do that if I was smoking weed every day. When I'm smoking weed every day the only time I want to get up is 'when I have to'.

Pretty stoked to be at 1 week after 16 years of daily use and I'm pleased that I'm following through on my side goals. Working on my health, trying to exercise more. Working on my hygiene and making sure I'm tidying up, brushing my teeth 3 times a day. Making sure my clothes are clean and washed. It's pretty embarrassing when I see it all written out like that - I'm a grown-ass man, I should be doing those things anyway.

Good luck to those also trying to make positive change in their life. I hope you're all taking care of yourself. Drink plenty of water and try to do some basic exercises if you are struggling on the day 1 - 3. Just 500 steps on the spot makes all the difference for me. If you manage to work up a sweat even better.",7,0

Hopeful because I know I won't always feel like poop and poop because currently I feel like poop. 

The thing I've realized is that the more open I am about quitting, the more support I have received from family members that I never thought would give me the time of day. Success?? 

My primary reasons to quit has been because I am tuning my abilities to become a better healer and tarot reader to my community and I have potential in this. In order to be what I want to be, I need to dance with the demons that I've tried to hide. As a survivor of I will not elaborate, but you can fill in the blanks, I never have come to terms with all the feelings I've kept inside. Anger is the main one and I know this will come up at some point of quitting. 

I don't have a strong group of friends in the state I live in to lean on and with covid, though my need for physical support is high, my health is more important for my sake and my dog's. 

I already meditate so that's nice and I do enjoy the magic woo woo where I've had energy work, reiki and other things. 

I know I deserve better and I want better because I want to show that anyone can choose to control their lives even if it seems impossible due to prior conditioning.

These last 18 days haver really brought out stuff within me that i had forgotten about when I was intoxicated for the last 3 years.  I will go through what i was feeling at the first couple days and how i progressed to where I‚Äôm at.

Starting with the first 3 days.  These were some of the hardest days, for me I used marijuana to sleep every night and it allowed me just to pass out and then wake up the next morning feeling groggy, but still feeling rested.  Sleep insomnia was a big thing, some nights i wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep at all until like 3-5 in the morning.  Some night I would drink a little bit just to get me to at least lay down and just close my eyes.  Another thing was the craving for a high, every night i would sit in my room just thinking and remembering why I started smoking in the first place, too not be bored.  But I realized something, all that craving is, is just your mind going through a major change.  Mental perseverance is everything, mind over matter always.  

Day 4-10, these were the days when i started to dream again.  When smoking weed i never had a single dream in the 3 years i was smoking.  These dreams were intense and some would even wake me up just to realize it was a dream.  Dreams are very healthy to have, it shows you are going into the natural REM cycle that your body needs for good amounts of energy.  But now i look forward to my dreams, it‚Äôs just something that i‚Äôve locked onto not being able to be high.  

Day 11-18, most of these days I don‚Äôt even think about marijuana anymore.  I still vape nicotine, which is a whole other issue that i need to conquer but quitting has opened my mind to what i can do and not what my thoughts are telling me.  For the people that read this whole thing I appreciate you, and if you are going through something like i did, know that your not alone.  Times get rough, depression may come and go with these first two weeks but just know that it‚Äôs the withdrawl and can and will be over.

Never before work, but always after and on the weekends I would wake and bake till monday. I used to love rushing home friday evening to get baked, get munched and play video games.

Since quitting, I am clearer headed, less paranoid about things, able to process things alot more clearly. I make no more mistakes in work. Im able to do things I would be to lazy to do or procrastinate about. Im saving a shit load of money and able to treat myself to things I want, new kicks, games basically anything I couldnt afford cause it was my dope money. I dont make stoned impulse buys.
I dont have mood swings, I can talk to people in public situations, shop clerk ect and Im not to stoned to help my elderly folks of they call with a problem, I dont have to lie and say Im busy or Im away. Along with a host of other benefits.

However, I have lost a huge part of my personality. Im no longer interested in the things I used to love. 
I used to be funny, witty and charismatic. Im boring now. Weed was who I was and now I need to come up with someway to make myself happy again. Im exercising, eating well, doing all the stuff I should do, but nothing is working.

Maybe I spent so long being high, I never learned who I really was. 

Keep up the good work, those of you who are quitting. It gets easier and you can look back and be proud of what you have achieved. When I see stoners, pot heads, dope fiends, I feel sorry for them nowadays.
I have had maybe 3 joints since January and regretted them all. All the bad shit associated with weed comes straight back.

Have been doing the best I can.,"I have no way of sourcing weed after taking extreme measures on day 1, so cravings feel like a fantasy. It has been a big help by having these desires shut down automatically by proxy of it being impossible, or at least really difficult. 

After months of stoned back-and-forth about my decision to stay in my city or move up to Scotland, I finally made the decision to move after long sober talks and thinking sessions. This would not have been possible otherwise, and this was an important decision I was procrastinating on making by smoking and being suspended from actually thinking about my next chapter.

I have been hyper-focused for a whole week on composing and writing a new song - something that was a much more regular thing for me to do but since lockdown and smoking 4x as much as usual, I‚Äôve never been less creative.

On top of that, got back into actual focused musical practice, and although only in little bursts, it‚Äôs still every day. It‚Äôs hard not to when there is nothing else to do.

Also been just letting myself chill. Been playing games and watching things that interest me. Going for walks more often. Etc.

Things feel quite normal and I‚Äôve missed it. 

However - I am aware that there are going to be obstacles. There‚Äôs gonna inevitably be a time I‚Äôm offered a joint or something. I‚Äôm trying right now as I write this to visualise and hear myself turning it down. It‚Äôs all I can do to prepare for that.

I hit 50 yrs old this year, and after smoking the weed basically every day for 30 yrs plus I finally found the strength to look at myself and say ""no more'. 
   I quit full time employment 2 yrs ago to look after my elderly disabled mother. I really don't know how I managed to stay employed while dealing with so much, but I struggled on and did my best. Smoking the herb wasn't really an issue while I was working, I earnt enough money so kinda just got into a groove. Leaving work to look after mum was a huge wake up call for me. I suddenly realised just how much money this was costing me. Not only that, but the realisation of how selfish I was being, hiding myself in my room smoking  only popping downstairs every now and then to see if she was ok. What a dick! 
  So 8 days ago I ran out of green, and said to myself, this is it, this is the moment everything will change.  Am happy to say I haven't given in. I'm not saying I haven't been tempted coz the thoughts are always there, back of your mind, that little devil saying 'go on, you know you want to' but so far I've resisted. Have realised something in myself tho. For me it's when I get aggravated, or something winds me up so bad that the first place I want to turn is to weed. I used it as a crutch, as my support to calm down. I almost crashed earlier, the silliest little thing got to me and there I was, pacing up and down my room, cursing and shouting. It took a good hour or so, and a supportive text from a friend and I started to calm. I don't need the weed to be calm or happy. Those feelings reside in me naturally, I just need the strength to see that. I realise that this is gonna be a long journey, and the most difficult journey I'll ever take, but I'm up for the fight. There's gonna be good days and bad but I won't let this beat me. I know I'm strong enough to beat this, and I also know that those of you out there that are struggling too are also strong enough to beat it. If you believe in yourself, and you truly want to get clean, these are the first thoughts to a better place. There is light at the end of the tunnel, but you've got to tread through all the crap to get there. I've only just started my journey, and there's a long way to go.
I do apologise for waffling on. If you've got this far I commend you. 
Stay strong, stay safe, and never give up the fight. Big luv.",11,0

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/heqgue/quitting_smoking_is_easy_ive_done_it_1000_times/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) is a link to my first post yesterday if you want to know more about my situation/past, but today Im gonna try to focus on what‚Äôs going to be different this time and why. 

So lets jump in:
1. **Reframing my mind** Stop saying/thinking things like ‚Äúill never smoke again‚Äù and ‚Äúim a failure because i smoked again‚Äù these negative thoughts lead to negative feelings which feed into my already existing depression. Reframe those thoughts into positive things. ‚ÄúI didnt smoke for 8 hours, and it was hard!‚Äù Or ‚Äúeven though my body feels like death, i did clean a tiny amount around the house today!‚Äù  These are things i can be proud of and i worked hard to accomplish, why do I belittle my own accomplishments and focus on my shortcomings? I plan on using short morning and evening meditation sessions to focus on reframing my thoughts. Forcing yourself to be positive for a few minutes a day can help you remember those things easier when you feel like shit. (If youre really depressed have someone who cares about you reframe your thoughts for you)

2. **Find my sources of motivation** i am EXTREMELY extrinsically motivated (competitive) and have always struggled with self discipline and internal motivations, my wife is the opposite. So Im going to try to use this to my advantage instead of wallowing in my own self pity. How? Im a grown ass man with a sticker chart!! Yea, and I fucking love it. I picked some really basic tasks that I wish I did more but dont and i can change them every week. my current chart only has 3 so im not overwhelmed or feel it is insurmountable. They are: exercise, brush my teeth, and pick up my house a little. This chart has helped me a ton because i think of it like a video game or competition where i have to get more stickers/ collect them faster than my wife (who cares none how fast she gets stickers lol) and when she is beating me in stickers im eager to get back in the race.  It also enables me to look back at the week and feel really proud of the stickers ive collected. I worked hard for some of those fuckers! Also we bought ourselves nice chocolate bars if We can get 18/21 this week we get the whole thing!!  The idea she is gonna be eating chocolate on sunday without me, Not happening!!!

3. **Quantify anything I can** ive never been good at taking care of my own body and mind. But one of the main motivating factors behind me wanting to quit is that i could ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù but everytime Ive quit i feel like shit and eventually i come back to weed. Often quickly. This is where technology can come in handy. I downloaded two apps that seem to be helping for now. They are: pillow and grounded (they both are free with optional premium subscriptions). Pillow is a sleep tracking app so I can see the difference in my sleep. Although im currently in the insomnia withdrawal state my sleep monitor already says I sleep harder when Im alseep and get more REM (rem rebound duh...). It also ties into the ihealth app and you can view trends like exercise, time standing, time one your phone before bed, vs sleep quality. Grounded is similar to quitting cigs or alchohol apps but focused directly at MJ smokers. Lets you keep track on the money you‚Äôve saved based on your current habits, and tracks common triggers and remedies to cravings in the premium version.  These statistics help me put a number on whats different in my life. Like ive saved $23.72 since i quit almost 2 days ago. That feels good! 

4. **Exercise** I see this one all the time and its one of the best and hardest things to do all in one. When you didnt sleep well, your stomach hurts, you feel nauseas, and just want to get blasted the last thing i want to do is exercise. But it helps me feel so much better when I do, and releases the chemicals my brain is so desperately craving. Similarly ive been trying to quantify my exercise with apps. I use my fitness tracker for general statistics and try to get 15 mins in a day of SOMETHING physical(ish). Seven is a workout app full of short body weight exercises you can do at home ranging from simple stretching to burbies and jump squats. I try to string together a couple of them if I feel up to it, and when I feel like shit i do the stretching routines. That way i never have an excuse not to start. And starting is the hard part. Often I think Ill only do one 7 min stretch workout and Ill end up doing 3 or 4 and 2 of them were HARD! 

4. **Dont just replace it** i think this is a common mistake people make. i am trying to get away from my substance dependence not redirect it to a new substance. I often drank a lot more when i didnt smoke. I usually drink maybe 1-2 beers a month, it can go to that many a day when im not stoned and get bored. This doesnt just refer to substance replacements. Running, meditation, hanging with friends are all great and healthy alternatives. But depending on a single one has bit me in the ass when suddenly my friends aren‚Äôt around and i sprained my ankle i find myself buying again. 

5. **Not setting myself up for failure** this one is hard to do because you want to challenge yourself to overcome this obstacle in your life but sometimes trying to eat the whole burger in one bite just isnt gonna happen. I tried hard not to pick things on my sticker chart that i would find excuses not to do, but also tried to be specific enough i would still do it. So dont go out running 10 miles day one, that isnt sustainable and your body cant handle it. And dont pick something like ‚Äúbe creative for 30 mins‚Äù cause you now are enforcing unnecessary rules on yourself and have a generic enough task it‚Äôs easy to brush off.  Ease into things and forgive yourself if you slip up. 

6. **Seek Support**  that‚Äôs probably why you are here. know there is a huge community out there ready to support you! Im gonna try to stay active on this subreddit for some time, because when you see other people with the same problems it can help you feel a little less alone and sad. And together we can work through this shit! 


All of these things are easier said than done. And i know that. But now I have a plan. And this time it‚Äôs gonna be different in the long run even if I smoke again, because im proud of the progress ive already made to get here. Its day 2 sober but ive been in this fight a lot longer.",11,0

Just discovered PAWS and feel so dumb.,"Background: 30 years old. Since I was around 21 I've always had pretty bad social anxiety (to the point where I would never want to leave the house unless I had to) but never intense bouts of legitimate anxiety unless something caused it. I always just avoided things that would trigger social anxiety so I rarely felt the anxiety from it unless I had to do stuff. Since I was about 18 I've had a terrible stomach and most foods would cause me to shit very soon after eating, sometimes immediately (esp after eating out which would often times cause immediate diarrhea). More on the stomach stuff later. In ~12 years I've only really ever taken a 3 month break to get clean for a job, other than that I've smoked pretty much every day (usually 1/2 to 1 full joint, never like an 8th a day). I've also, for the past 6 years or so, had bad mucus problems in the morning where sometimes I wake up with what feels like a ton of mucus in my throat, doctors chalked it up to postnasal drip or acid reflux. Since quitting the mucus has gone down, but I still feel like there is some in the back of my throat after eating that keeps coming back after I swallow (this could be completely unrelated though).

6 weeks ago I had taken a bong hit one morning, felt a wave of anxiety and immediately threw up - never happened to me before. (Note that this was the last hit of weed I ever took). I felt anxious throughout the day, tried to sleep it off. Woke up the next day with the chills. Layed in bed all day. The morning after that I had VIOLENT chills, and set up a virtual call with first med. She told me the symptoms sounded like corona. I went in for a checkup and they said vitals were normal, and tested me for covid. A few days before the test results were supposed to come in I woke up with intense anxiety to the point of having a full blown panic attack. I've only had two before in my life (once from having to tell my boss I was quitting and another when I noticed I ate undercooked food) but those were about 70-80% of the intensity of this one. And it seemingly came out of nowhere. I called an actual doctor the next day and did a virtual call, told him everything going on and in addition that I was a daily smoker for 10+ years and he told me the weed was probably contributing to underlying anxiety.

That was basically the first week or two after I took my last hit. After I tested negative for covid, I noticed the anxiety didn't go away. I would wake up most mornings for a while feeling anxiety as soon as I opened my eyes, and this led to diarrhea shortly after and generally feeling like I was ""broken"". I've always felt a little broken, but never like this. Over the past few weeks, my poops began to get more solid and that alone was a good sign for me, thinking it was just some bad bug or that I had just developed general anxiety disorder out of nowhere and that was causing morning diarrhea.

The past two weeks haven't really been all that bad. I've had 3-4 day streaks where I felt relatively fine. But yesterday I woke up with anxiety again (after not waking up with it for 1-2 weeks), and it wouldn't go away. This morning I also woke up with anxiety (not as bad as yesterday), but toughed it out. Both days, I had to shit nearly immediately after waking up, but what was odd was yesterday was fairly solid and today was straight up diarrhea. 

I noticed my energy levels haven't had me feeling nearly as lazy as I did when I was a smoker, but even the most basic of exercise gets me winded hard now (not that I was in incredible shape before, but I get out of breath going up and down stairs now). I went to do yardwork the other day and had to stop because I felt I overexerted myself and was going to pass out.

I've been dieting significantly better (eating half portions of dinner, not eating before bed anymore whereas I used to eat a ton) and have lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks. I've been eating smaller portions in general to help with the stomach issues, thinking overeating could have been leading to immediate pooping this whole time. So it struck me weird to have diarrhea in the morning again (past 1-2 weeks I would poop at night and that was that). 

Today I discovered PAWS and reading what you guys are going through it sounds super similar. I never went through sadness/depression (or what I envision that to be), but the anxiety has been the worst part of it for me. Normal day it will hit me at random times, and sometimes linger for 1-3 hours. But if I had to scale it from 1 to 100, it would be like a 20-40%, sometimes even only a 5-10% feeling of uneasiness. I only had a panic attack that one time early on in week 1 or 2. I just can't deal with it coming up out of nowhere. I was literally sitting there playing the last of us 2 riding a horse not thinking of anything and bam, just hits me.

Reading this could take up to a year to get over is super disheartening. I feel like I don't have control over my life and I'm unemployed and this is making me not want to seek out work, the social anxiety was making that hard enough. But I'm visiting the doctor in 2 weeks for a checkup/bloodwork and am glad to know that PAWS could be contributing to a lot of symptoms, which I will bring up to him. If he finds nothing wrong, I'm convinced either I have PAWS or weed was supressing all of this this whole time.

The strangest thing is, I quit cold turkey but have had ZERO desire to take a hit at all. The last time I quit for 3 months (2014ish) I felt like a fiend for it. But I don't really crave it whatsoever and haven't since the day I took the last hit. Not even a little. My brother and father smoke in the house and I smell it and even that doesn't make me want to do it.

At this point it just is the anxiety that kills me. I don't have foggy memory or anything like that, and I'm generally fine up until I go to bed. It's just the immediate morning when I wake up sometimes, and at random points in the day the anxiety will come and my chest will feel slightly heavy - perfect symptom to come around when covid has that as symptom #1!. One time I even woke up feeling like I was holding my breath right before I woke up - hopefully that wasn't undiagnosed slep apnea

The kicker is what a lot of you went through with dreams, I did too! I thought something was way off because I haven't dreamed in... what feels like almost 10 years. Now I get them a lot. Funnily enough, the first dream I had in the first week of all of this was my first wet dream since high school 

Discovering this subreddit was somewhat theraputic for me to know it could be withdrawals and not a lifelong anxiety thing I will have to deal with. Sorry if this was a long post but I haven't talked to anyone about this besides parents since it all began and it was kind of a purge of the last 6 weeks of my life which has had me feeling like I was shattered mentally and physically",8,4

it‚Äôs officially day 2, if you check my profile you‚Äôll see this isn‚Äôt the first time i quit, but this time it was so much easier, i think it‚Äôs because i‚Äôve known mj is not good for me. i have been suffering from anxiety and depression ever since i had a huge breakdown 2 years ago, before the breakdown i was hitting over 15 poppers a day (mj and a piece of cig) i think all the mj fucked up my brain, well no fucked it up but brought a lot of trauma and problems to the surface, i was always the type of person who put a mask on to keep me protected from all my childhood trauma, but it also forced me to accept it, i got the help i needed. i still have a lot of healing ahead of me, i‚Äôm going to be getting into psychotherapy. 
this whole week i have been cutting down, everytime i smoked i would get panic attacks, i basically just waited till the high went down and i got 10 minutes of just satisfaction, but i realized it was more of a habit, an addiction to the actual process of hitting a bong, i hate being high, it‚Äôs not fun for me anymore, i felt like i was going crazy. i got these episodes where it felt like my eyes were on my shoulder and i wasn‚Äôt in my body. yesterday was my first full day without hitting one b, i think because i cut down the withdrawels haven‚Äôt hit too hard, i feel like i can feel my body more? that probably won‚Äôt make sense but it‚Äôs almost like mj numbed everything, i feel more clear headed and it‚Äôs only the second day. but the dreams get so bad, when i was in the hospital and was forced to quit all i dreamt about was my childhood trauma, i would wake up crying in complete sweat, i‚Äôm so afraid but i know these are things i have to deal with. my mindset is strong, i know i want this and i know this is what i need. i would roll out of bed, and hit a b right away, i don‚Äôt want to be an addict anymore, i want to take my life back.
this forum has been more helpful then i can even explain, it‚Äôs given me the hope i needed to quit. 
sorry this was a whole long post with no real point to it, i think i just need to write to get all these feelings out.

I stopped smoking earlier this year and it feels so good to not have my mind busy on when the next time I‚Äôm gonna get high will be. It‚Äôs a relief to focus my mind on other things, even though I miss it quite often.

The thing is, even though I would smoke almost every day, it was always in really tiny increments ‚Äî I could make a gram last over a month, so it was like I was micro-dosing weed.

A friend of mind, who smokes daily, seems to dismiss the fact that I felt a had a habitual/not good relationship with weed. She tells me I was a light-weight and weed wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúright drug‚Äù for me even though I know in my mind that weed was THE drug that I simply couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about and have had a relationship with FOR YEARS.

I suppose I don‚Äôt know what to make of the situation. Friend seems to want to limit her own smoking - she says she wants to adopt a dog so she trains it rather than getting high - but will dismiss my own story when it comes to my relationship with weed.

I‚Äôm proud of myself for finally stopping! I feel like I have a relatable story to share and that I could be a great support for someone who hints at being tired of smoking weed. but I struggle to understand if it‚Äôs my place to offer support to this friend.",11,0
239,2020-06-24 13:16:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hf512z/the_addiction_phenomenon_one_more_day_and_friends/,"The addiction phenomenon ""One more day"" And friends who do not understand.","I've been constantly reentering this cycle of just one more day, just smoking one more day, seriously believing that i am telling the truth this time. Even though the evidence says that one more days leads to more, which i am highly aware of yet still smoke. 

I wake up the next day like ""Damn, i could've skipped that smoke and been on day two now, or day four"" or however many days the cycle goes on for. It is the addiction phenomenon. Somehow even when you're about to smoke, even though you know it is not the right decision, you do in the heat of the moment quicker than an eye blinks, and the next moment you're sitting there wondering how you let that happen again. 

It is very hard to explain the addiction phenomenon to non smokers. My friends tell me if i wanted to quit, I would, and that I must want to smoke if i keep doing it. While quitting it is this simple somewhat (I believe there are tips to cope, but in the end there is no secret ingredient, you have to power through and just have a higher knowledge and drive to skip the session and it can be very difficult) It is this weird psychological cycle where your brain is just the master at convincing you to smoke or slip up, its hard to describe because the addiction phenomenon is illogical and does not match up with what you know to be rational sources of reasonings. Friends will say ""You always everyday you're going to quit, and don't"" and you are just like ""Yeah, I honestly don't know how that happened."" But you do, and you don't know at the same time. You've studied the addiction cycle over and over, you know all the ins-and-outs, all the logistics, all the excuses and places it can be easy to caught back in the loop, but just fail to execute it. 

And it is very hard to have a conversation about addiction or with non-smokers or people who do not think they're addicted even because despite telling them that you know what you're doing wrong and still just not fixing it, they almost don't believe that you actually understand the cycle even though you know it better than anyone, they'll try to explain what you're doing wrong, even though you already know the angles and now its just a matter of support and motivation, and while just looking for support, it can be difficult when your friends misinterpret and instead of supporting they give unwanted advice, hard advice, it may have truth though it often is not what i want to hear and can be frustrating because sometimes friends go too hard, and try to make it their mission for you to stop because they think you want that when you don't want them to do that. They'll start acting like parents, a little too intrusive and its annoying. Offering hard solutions with no support or understanding. 

 And i appreciate and understand they have good intentions, but I just want them to say something that allows me to understand they are on my level like  ""yeah i understand, its going to be hard but you probably should throw out your stuff and stop hanging out with weed smoking friends, not forever, but until you have control. they should respect you and your decision if they're your true friends and it will suck and you might be lonely for two weeks until you get back on your feet and re-adjust, but you can call me and when can hang out if you get bored"" rather than just abruptly saying something like ""Im coming to your house and taking your weed stash right now"" out of no where because they're trying to be super extra and invasive on the help.

Idk, just some stuff i was thinking about. Not sure if I formulated the post as well as I would have liked, because I feel like I didn't explain and articulate the addiction phenomenon and my problems with my friends as well as i would have liked. But this is something that has been happening to me and was wondering if anyone goes through the same type of things.",9,0

And it‚Äôs been 13 years of smoking multiple times a day. I usually would mix tobacco in with the weed this recent year too. So I think that made it more addictive. But it‚Äôs day three of being sober and I didn‚Äôt sleep at all last night and I have no appetite but I‚Äôm on day three. 

I‚Äôm 28, and I have been in such a haze for years. I haven‚Äôt accomplished anything in a long time. I lost my love of reading and I used to really, really love to read. And I know it‚Äôs worth it to quit. 

My dad just died and he wanted me to quit. And my family needs me and I need me.. and I need to know I‚Äôm being the girl my dad knew I could be. But I can‚Äôt be that girl when I don‚Äôt know how my brain even is without weed. 

And I‚Äôm scared but I just want to see if I can make it one week without it. And then I can reevaluate but I just have never done that purposely. If I did it‚Äôs only because I had some other form of inebriation to distract me. 

In the haze of the last 13 years I don‚Äôt quite know how many times I let myself or others down. I know what I remember I regret a lot. But I also know one day I want to look back on this year as the year I quit weed. The year I overcame all my excuses and started living. 

Because with all the repression of my emotions and the spills of anger and depression that occurred because of my usage it feels like I haven‚Äôt really been living. It feels like I gave my autonomy to marijuana. I hide it from so many people, people I love and care about. So many times I chose pot instead of rent or food. And I‚Äôm tired of my friggin excuses. There aren‚Äôt any good ones. 

I chose to smoke pot every day. Even when I realized the effects it was having on my mental health and wanted to quit, I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve wanted to quit weed since I was 20 and someone dumped me partially over my problematic usage. And I wanted to quit for so many reasons since then too. I‚Äôd get into rages or bouts of intense sadness or anxiety if I couldn‚Äôt smoke. 

But I want this to last. And I‚Äôm sorry for ranting I just wanted to write this. And maybe if you have advice or encouragement you‚Äôd be willing to give it to me? 

Anyway thanks for reading my rant. I hope to be writing another one at the 7 day mark.",3,0

I had achieved nothing in nearly 14 years drug taking.  I was depressed and the rest of the world, family, govt, society, anyone but me was to blame for my lack of commitment, inactivity, anger, poverty, unsocial behaviour, underachievement and poor motivation.

I woke up to myself when my kids came along at 28. I started doing things - ya know like you have too do with kids!  Yep kids and the need to look after them and expectation from my partner forced me to distraction from smoking. A couple of minor relapses.

Family was a key motivator and it was a struggle to divorce myself from those influences. It doesn't really matter where the motivation came from - I made the choices- it was always up to me. I could have said fuck this and walked out the door back to my pipe..

I went from strumming a guitar to learning to read music and playing classical. I raised a severely disabled child and two more beautiful daughters. I went to University and gained a degree in environmental science with honours. Didn't start my degree until I was 33. Now at 25 years clean I work in a senior advisory capacity managing a small team.

My disabled stepdaughter passed away 2 yrs ago. We were all there holding her in icu. Her mum passed away young with brain cancer just a couple of months ago - we had divorced and its been difficult for our daughters (and me). My eldest daughter is a lawyer. My youngest a software engineer. Together, we broke a cycle of poor education and  poverty and addictions.

I'm sorry if this sounds a bit much and I'm sounding too proud about it.

I'm writing this as a message of encouragement and motivation. 

1.  I found enjoyment, energy and drive and achieved success that simply would not be possible if I were still married to my pipe. 


2. Life got hard sometimes but at least I was in it.

I did relapse a few times after a month clean, 2 weeks clean, etc and now I'm back on Day 3. The past week I'd smoked every day, all day and so the past few days I've had some withdrawal symptoms but nothing major. The first night it took me forever to fall asleep but last night I fell asleep pretty easily and was thankful. Anyways, I ate some food that made me feel nauseous and terrible, I think not withdrawal related, it just did not sit right with me. I felt sick for hours, wasn't sure if I was gonna throw up but just generally felt gross until I fell asleep. I kept thinking, if I just take one tiny hit I will feel better. I even took out my grinder and found some bits in it and was about to put it in my bowl (I don't have any actual weed, just searching for crumbs, think we've all been there). But I stopped myself, and I just struggled through the nausea. And you know what... it was worth it! I need to solidify the fact that I can't just get high every time life inconveniences me. Sometimes we feel sick, that's just part of life. Smoking it away isn't the answer. It's possible to just get through it. Same goes with other problems in life. You just gotta get through it. 

Anyway, I'm optimistic about my journey. Weed is NOT for me, I completely lose control, and I know I'm better than this and life is more than this. I felt like I needed to have the relapse experience to know that I can't just go back to smoking, I CAN'T MODERATE, I just can't smoke weed. And you know what... I DON'T SMOKE WEED!

I'm 25 years old, and i've lurked the sub r/stopdrinking for years, as i've abused alcohol for years. I've tried to quit drinking many times. In early February I got drunk one night, woke up puking (I throw up at least 3 times a week for the last 2 years) and I didn't stop vomiting for 4 days-- accompanied by extreme back and abdominal pain. It landed me in the ER, and while they didn't think it was a hangover, they thought alcohol may have sparked something.

I haven't had a drink since.

I had picked up smoking weed back in September, and it was slowly replacing alcohol for me-- helping me drink less, though alcohol has always been my first love. Once I couldn't drink and risk another vomiting episode like this, I went fully into smoking-- in the morning, around noon, and then in the evening to help me eat and signal it's time for bed. I continued to vomit 3 times a week.

May 31, I started puking again. This time I didn't stop for 11 days. I went to the ER 3 times, and was finally admitted to the hospital on day 10 of the episode. I stayed overnight and was good to go the next day. I've since been diagnosed with Gastroparesis- a slow emptying of the stomach. They think it's also Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome-- a vomiting reaction to cannabis in any form. To figure out if I have CHS, I now have to abstain from weed altogether.

I haven't smoked weed since the start of my last episode, and I haven't thrown up since my last episode ended. So unless I have another episode and find weed isn't the cause, it's looking like I will need to fully abstain from cannabis forever.

Suddenly, not drinking is a lot more difficult, because I had truly replaced one with the other. I miss smoking so much-- and the people around me (my roommate and best friends) do it everyday. It's all over my house, and our evening routine is no longer, so I've been avoiding being in my home so that I'm not around the people closest to me. It pulls my heartstrings seeing the bong in the kitchen. Luckily, the people close to me in this season of my life aren't drinkers, and with the bars closed because of the pandemic, it's helped me to avoid alcohol.

I know that people smoke for years and years and quit. Decades, for many of you. I recognize I hadn't smoked long, and I think the fact that weed had really replaced alcohol in my life is what makes it difficult. I'm now facing the fact that I may need to live a life of total sobriety. My predominant feeling is that I'm honestly just pissed, and sad, and feel like I'm grieving something. My mom has been sober my whole life after a tumultuous 20s, and I always thought I could be ""good enough"" at substance use that I wouldn't end up like her. Now the idea of being fully sober is so daunting, disappointing, infuriating. It's hard to face and it's incredibly isolating to not have sober people my age around me.

I guess I'm just posting because I need a little bit of love and solidarity. Anyone else with experience with cannabinoid hyperemesis? Anyone else quitting multiple substances at once? Anyone else feeling isolating? I feel like I'm screaming into a void every single day, and I need support.

I also just ordered the book ""refuge recovery""-- I don't know if it's for me, I don't know if I'm an alcoholic, I don't know if I struggle with addiction. I just know that the substances I use have hurt me so deeply- physically, emotionally, I've lost so much time, so many mornings, so many evenings. I'm getting my life back but I don't know how to envision a life without weed and alcohol. Can someone tell me I can do it?

My clocks:

Alcohol sober- 131 days

Weed sober- 23 days

Days since vomiting- 16 days (the longest I've gone in 2 years)",9,1

Lately I have been entertaining the idea of smoking again once I hit 6 months sober (in a couple weeks). I don't think about weed daily anymore, in fact I seldom really get cravings for it and even when I do, it's pretty easy to brush them aside.

However, I do still have the occasional longing for it in certain planned circumstances. In these situations, I know I don't *need* weed to have fun, or for the thing to be enjoyable, but I know that there is a certain enhancement there that would definitely occur if I did smoke.

I realize the odds are against me if I choose to smoke again. I know many of you have tried to jump back in and moderate, or only smoke at certain times, on certain days, etc. I know that I quit specifically because I was just habitually overusing to where it wasn't fun anymore. I guess that's where the wonder comes in and the core of the question I have swirling around in my head.

Is it possible for me to reform my relationship with weed after having spent 6 months completely sober and seeing life without those shackles, or am I doomed to repeat my past if I ever pick it up again? I realize only I can truly answer this and I have to say that I really don't know the answer. Even when I dig deep, part of me feels like I could rebuild that into something more acceptable, but part of me says that's just a lie. 

Just wanted to get this out there.

Thank you all. Hope you're well :)",4,0

My motivation to quit has been building higher and higher over the last few months as my opinion of myself was sinking lower and lower and on 19th June I purposely went through all my bud so that I wouldn't have anything to smoke and am now on day 5 sober.

For months or maybe years now I'm not sure, I've felt like I am close to tears too often, it could be something small like a TV advert or a short Instagram video that would make me have that lump in my throat and feel like sobbing, but I'm a 35 year old man, so of course I swallowed, ignored and smoked away any feelings. 

On day 2 of not smoking, I cried, i think all of life's challenges just got on top of me and I've had no training to deal with life as in the past I would just use life's cheat code ""up, down, left, right, get high and forget""

I hope that as the sober days pass that I will get mentally fitter.  There are jobs at work that I have procrastinated on for too long but that I don't yet have the courage to face.

I was smoking almost 1.5 oz a week. I Always wanted to stop because I didn't want my wife to have to deal with an addict ( just the most amazing wife you can ask for) and I also notice my memory going really bad I couldn't remember simple things, my brain was just ""foggy"". I tried to stop a few times but never passed 30 days and I always went right back to 9am-1am smoking, for the past 10 years.  
How did I stop?  Well.. . easy, I found 1 oz of a 8 years old weed in a pack in my wardrobe. After smoking that for a week I started having some crazy right side headaches that would intensify if I smoked, even 2 weeks after I stopped every time I laid my head on the pillow the headache would start again making impossible to sleep.  I called the ENT doc and they prescribed me some antibiotics but even  after 2 weeks on it the pain was still there. I tough I was done and this shit would never go away or I had something  serious. \~40 days later the pain was slowly fading to finally be totally gone by now.  I also remember the last time I smoked:  I cried a lot, I am a son and grandson of  heavy alcoholics, and I could see myself turning into the same thing, that wouldn't go away, that was my last call, like a cycle which I decided to break.  
Which brings me here, 55 days later and counting, not wanting to smoke weed afraid the headache will come back this time I won't fall. I Got hook up on programming  and can't stop.

   Withdraws: I'm having crazy dreams that wakes me up several times at night ( seem some reports here).  I feel tired and want to sleep all day, very  unmotivated and this quarantine doesn't help. On top of that I also went crazy: I cut sugar from my diet( that I used to eat a LOT)  and stopped playing video games ( was probably playing 6-8hs a day). Besides the withdraws: colors are brighter, I can already feel the difference and and I can't  wait to see the 90  days, 120, 180 days mark brings.  
Getting my life back, I am sad to have lost all this years.   I know 55 days is not a lot but for me it is one of the biggest life changes I made. For those out there who are struggling with it : I feel you. I wish it could be easier.  
   

TL;DR  
   I smoked some 8 years old weed that gave me crazy headaches even 30 days after my last smoke.

I've recently been going through a pretty rough time with a breakup from a relationship that was really anxiety-inducing for me. During this relationship, I ended up using cannabis as a way of coping with the stresses of my life. My cannabis smoking ended up triggering some negative, anxious, thought-loops that would persist when I would be sober. These anxieties (and other issues) led to the break-up and me going down a negative spiral of using cannabis daily (multiple times a day). My cannabis usage is disruptive to many aspects of my life and even my relationships with friends (i.e not keeping commitments because I'm too high and forgot or cant function). I've been through other attempts at quitting, but I feel that for the sake of my life and my mental health I need to succeed this time.

I'd love if you guys could point me to any self-improvement resources for people trying to get their shit together! I'm kinda overwhelmed with resources.

(day 1... again)","This was one of my favorite quotes. It‚Äôs by Mark Twain and is about cigs, but it applies to weed for me. 

I (28M) have been a habitual daily smoker since i was about 19... That almost doesnt do it justice, I have been permanently high since I was 19. I burned through about a Q a week for most of my 20s until the last 2 years where I moved to concentrates. I now usually kill 2-3 (1g) carts a week depending on what Im doing. 

I have quit so many times I cant even count any more, and it‚Äôs been years of me talking about quitting, talking about how weed is bad for me, talking about the money Im spending on what amounts to nothing constructive in my life. And swearing I would be quitting imminently!!!

And every time I quit I think ‚Äú‚Äùthis time is different...‚Äù‚Äù but usually, i make it 1-2 days before my symptoms of withdrawal and depression pile up and Im trying to pickup again... then before I even really sit down and think Im back home with enough bud/carts to last me a week. So i tell myself ‚Äú‚Äùyou already spent the money, dont throw it away, you‚Äôll quit tomorrow/next week/soon!‚Äù‚Äù 

But then next week comes and I find myself doing the same shit. 

The best Ive ever done was prob about 3.5 months (early last year). It was the healthiest I had felt in my adult life and I can remember telling people i wouldn‚Äôt be going back to smoking. But my job is a unique one and about 80% of my coworkers smoke. And about 10-15% smoke at work. So it is impossible for me not to be around. Also my job can be one of the most boring things on earth some days, and we work 14-16 hour shifts. Thus I always fall back into the same trap when someone offers me a puff on a long boring night. Telling myself it‚Äôs no big deal and that I wont smoke all the time again. Just on occasion or when im with friends. But then before i know it Im hitting my homies pen once a day after work, then at lunch too, then more, then im throwing him cash for the hassle. Then i just buy my own cart so i dont have to rely on him. Now suddely im hitting it all the time and high all the fucking time again. 

Alternatively when Im not working I do NOTHING! It‚Äôs a beautiful thing. I work so long and so hard that when its the weekend I just wanna veg... and what better way to forget my problems than to get blasted to mars on dabs and play video games until monday? Or between gigs when all my friends and wife are still working and Im not, I have all day to sit around in my own head bored. 

So I am always making up excuses no matter my situation. It‚Äôs the easy thing to do. Change is hard... 

The last time when i quit for a while just lurking here really helped me a lot. So Ive decided to come post for the first time. I think if nothing else it‚Äôs been really good for me to put into words a lot of my feelings. 

If you made it to the end Im impressed, thanks for taking the time to read my small story. Im gonna try to come back and post routinely.

It was easier to just say no. And I love that!

I've let go of my stoner friends and I'm spending more time with new, frankly better people who truly care about me. I hope to reconcile with my stoner crew at some point, but for now this shift in relationships is a blessing.

I'm realizing my cravings are, unsurprisingly, linked to PMS. I get depressed, feel numb, and think I might as well smoke. But if I can pull through those rough couple days, the rest of the month is pretty easy going at this point. ***people who menstruate, we have cyclical hormones, addiction looks different for us. Treat yourself accordingly. 

My sleep was terrible those first 2 weeks, then great for 2 weeks, and now back to its typical terribleness. But I had difficulty sleeping long before I got into weed. It's just something I live with I guess. Disappointing. I like dreaming though (once my dreams settled down). That makes the idea of sleeping a little better.

I've made a couple of posts previously, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/chizto/after_several_years_of_selfdeception_ive_finally/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d5ye16/59_days_sober_and_emotions_are_now_flooding_back/).

Got three months or so, totally clean last year and then backslid, and I feel like it was a jump cut in a movie and six months have gone past and I've been stoned for most of them. Today is day number #31 and if I can make it to the end of it I will have gotten a month clean under my belt. I'm trying to resist the urge to think in terms of getting those three months back, or any other milestone for that matter. It's the oldest cliche in the book, but one day at a time.

I'm now finally at a point where I'm realising that I need to accept outside help. I've started seeing a therapist and I've found an NA meeting that meets on zoom at 7am weekdays. I can't believe that I'm enjoying it as much as I am. It's an incredibly humbling and positive thing and I would urge anyone to give it a crack, even just purely in the spirit of experimentation. I'm not sure if I see myself getting and sponsor and ""working the steps"" thing...maybe? I can't really handle the whole God thing, I have to be honest. I know that it doesn't have to be a strict literal thing, but that kind of language doesn't really resonate with me, to put it lightly. But that's ok, it doesn't mean that it couldn't be a positive thing for me.

I can't afford to buy into the myth that just because I have a month up, or even three months up, that I'm sorted. I can't afford a relapse, because weed just fucking owns me. And that's ok. I just need to keep that insight in view at all times. And a big part of that is realising that I'm no better than any other addict. That's part of what I'm enjoying about NA. I'm really getting to understand for the first time. I'm just incredibly fortunate that for whatever reason (for which I can't take credit) I didn't get onto harder drugs like meth or opiates. I did get onto coke, and what a waste that has been. And I like to try and forget about my problem with coke usage, deny that it happened. All of the wasted money, all of the shameful behaviour... But i can't run away from that shit anymore. And again, I just need to own the fact that it's pure luck that I live in Australia where the coke is shit and insanely expensive and thus much harder to finance a habit.

I mean the truth is, weed isn't that cheap. I shudder to think of the money that I've spent on weed over the last ten years, and that is just where the cost begins. The way that weed has hollowed me out, weakened my relationships and destroyed my self worth has been a horrible thing, and I don't want it anymore.

Anyway, I'll leave it there. Love you guys, and all the best. Consider an NA meeting, as I've said, I've only attended four in four days so I'm no expert, but it's an interesting thing, and as great at this sub is,  there's only so much accountability that an online forum can afford you.

I could not have taken on this challenge without reading the experiences of others going through the same thing. I quit smoking weed with the intent of deepening my spiritual practice. Though I never felt as though it was ruining my life, I had definitely become dependent, and this worried me. The worry contributed to the smoking, which contributed to the worry, and so it went for years. The shame coupled with not being able to stop all of the times I had set out to stop was becoming crippling and I eventually had to face the discomfort and fear and somehow, I managed to quit. I decided with my therapist that 3 months would be a good goal. My life was largely in order - finishing grad school, having just gotten married and purchasing a home. The decision to quit was for me and me only. 

The benefits of quitting have been vast. My health, both physical and mental, have improved tenfold. I feel calmer and able to withstand the normal storms that life brings without needing the high to look forward to later in the evening ( I was a daily, nighttime smoker). Most of all, it allowed me to connect further with myself and to understand my own strength and ability to cope with my surroundings. That being said, I still miss it. I've learned where it fits into my life and that with anything else, moderation is key. In a perfect world, I want to be able to pick and choose when to smoke - to use it on the weekends when I want a fun release. I don't want to be reliant on it like I was. 

So, I'm writing because I was hoping any of you who have gone through this same experience can share your thoughts and how you dealt with it/the decisions that you made. Friday marks my three month goal and I am so proud, but pretty anxious.  Part of me wants to grab an edible from a friend and reward myself, while the other is nervous that I'll fall back into the same cycle. Though I have spent this time to really tackle the underlying issues that led my to smoking to begin with, am I silly to think that I can pick it back up and not face the same consequences?

That's the short, here's the long:

I made this account on 4/20/19 because I felt that I had to do something to recognize the significance of the day, while also recognizing the desire to quit smoking that I had held for long before I discovered this sub. 2019 was a really rough year for me due to personal reasons, and as weed acts as an amplifier for emotions (both good and bad in my opinion,) the year was only made worse, as I tried to drown my sorrows in the ""comfort"" that was the sweet taste of a joint, no matter the time of the day. 

I had continued to smoke throughout the year, taking periodic breaks here and there, but spending most of my time high, until I took a trip back home in February of this year. I still smoked while back home, and in a way it was a positive experience, as I had managed to get my head straight and wasn't feeling the anxiety that weed can sometimes give me, but rather, just enjoying being social with my smoker friends through the passing of a joint and those long and, albeit, unfocused deep talks.

I usually travel with weed, and I had a connection flight home. I smoked the last bit of weed I had at JFK before learning that my flight had been canceled, meaning I had some time to explore NYC. This was an interesting opportunity for me, but I dreaded the idea of being alone there without a joint. I met up with an old friend who had moved there for lunch and then set out to explore the place for the 4 or 5 hours I had before my flight. I ended up at Washington Square Park, where I found myself with the opportunity to buy some weed to satisfy my itch. Luckily though, I only had about 4 bucks on me, and an atm was nowhere to be found. Something clicked in this moment, and I realized that it would be the right moment to maybe try and enjoy not being high for the first time. It was, and it would lead to an incredible period in my life that has built me up to where I am now. 

I finally arrived at home (I live in Switzerland, if any of you are wondering about that by this point) and I greeted my roommates with some exciting news: I think this is my chance to quit smoking weed! They weren't massively impressed, but that didn't matter, because it was important to me. I had gone a week at that point without smoking, but I was finding it difficult - so I made a compromise: let's just smoke on the weekends when it feels right and avoid it otherwise. It worked well for a while! I had felt better at that point than I had at any point in the last year and a half. I met my current girlfriend (who is quite a huge stoner) at an event, made some nice connections with people whom I hope to soon call my friends, and was feeling great at my service job by utilizing my new found energy to make people smile and find joy in that. 

My girlfriend would stay over some weekends, and although I had my mission to stay away from weed as much as possible, I wouldn't stop her from smoking. It was mostly alright, but there were a few times where the temptation was too much and we shared a joint. I can only describe the feelings I had in this moment as anxious and uncomfortable, as the second the smoke entered my lungs, my insecurities arose and she had to help comfort me.

I kept on like this, eventually getting comfortable with the occasional joint with her and friends, until the quarantine came. I'll never forget the moment I walked into our living room and saw my roommates smoking J's while watching a movie and I made a comment about how much they had been smoking lately. Their response? ""We're in lockdown, what else is there to do?"" 

Well *sheiiiiiiiiiit* that's a good point! 

I spent the whole lockdown high as a kite. So many wake and bakes. I was barely even a functioning human being on 4/20, but I was having ""fun."" 

Well fast forward to a month and a half ago, and my girlfriend and I start having some problems, more because of some trauma that she was dealing with. All of this stress led us to take a break, and in that first week, I smoked through half of my stash. I was not sober for a moment, and I felt **terrible.** 

It was on Saturday, May 21, after spending the entire day high and thinking about how things seemed to be going continuously south, that I realized something had to change. I had to quit weed for good.

On that Sunday, I stashed away all of my smoking supplies and made the decision to take a break. I didn't have a concrete idea about how long I'd last, but I had the zeal to keep on going. I vocalized my intentions to my roommates, to which they laughed and told me they'd believe me after they saw some progress, but that didn't matter. I was doing this for me. 

And I did! Somehow, among all of the strife and trouble that was surrounding me, I found it my easiest quit attempt. In no way do I miss weed, other than perhaps the social aspect of passing joint around the room, but I *certainly* don't miss being high. I feel more alive and aware of my surroundings than I've felt in a while, and this has helped me overcome the problems that I was having. I found a way to be there for my girlfriend, and our relationship is flourishing. I'm doing better at university, and I'm once again being my best me at work. 

There are some things that might have helped me quit. I started smoking damiana, a South American herb with relaxing properties that can be made either into a tea or rolled with tobacco into a joint. It satisfies that itch to pass something around and doesn't get me high. If anything, it helps me sleep! Still, it would be unfair to suggest this as a solution for those looking to quit.

Anyway, that's my quit story. I'm incredibly happy to be at the point that I'm at, and I'm looking forward to keep on going with my new found freedom from weed. Now time to try and get my girlfriend to try and quit as well... I think it would really benefit her! 

Thank you so much to this community for constantly keeping the idea of quitting in my head. I've been a long time lurker, but it clearly wasn't for nothing. Your experiences have been inspiring in my decision, and I wish all of you luck and continued success in your endeavors.

Lots of love,

But does that stop me from going back every couple of weeks after successfully quitting for a month or so? Heck no. Like many others I'm going back for 'just one more bag', chasing the same old thrill. **And it's never there**.

I can honestly say that the following happens pretty much every time I go back for more:

\- Not investing my time properly during evenings. I'll spend hours staring at my phone or a game without making any genuine progress or doing anything meaningful.  
\- Leaving my family by the wayside, without my attention, during the daytime and the evenings. I'll either be mentally occupied thinking about getting stoned later, or actually be stoned and not listen.  
\- Eating a week's snacks in a weekend and wrecking the food budget  (and any healthy eating goals).  
\- Not be bothered to exercise at all, ruining any good ground recently made in fitness.  
\- Lackluster performance at work, particularly when working from home, resulting in getting things wrong and not doing my career any favours.

I have acknowledged that my family, my own health and my perosnal development are the most critical parts of my life right now. But in the face of that, i'll drop it all for weed, every time.

I'm naturally lazy and am my own worst enemy, weed is the deadly weapon my lazy self uses to surpress any drive the rest of me might have. It keeps me from living a better life and enjoying it fuller with the people that matter.

I won't let that guy dictate the course of my life anymore. My life is mine to live. I'm 30 in just over a month, and I'm going to hit that milestone and enjoy that day with a fresh mindset, and be proud that I've managed to do so.

To anyone else at day 1 again - there's no doubt you can do this if you focus on what matters to you.

Weed is ruining my life..

As much as I would not like to stop, but now is the time for me to give up weed.

I‚Äôve been smoking weed since high school, so DAILY almost for 8 years.. yes 8 years daily.

At first, it was great, loved getting high, loved the feeling, BUT it did trigger very little anxiety for me.

For the past 4 years, my life has made a spiral downhill, at this point weed is taking over. I don‚Äôt want to do anything fun or productive without smoking weed, I have become serverly Anti-Social, My anxiety worsened 10x over the years, and depression has started to kick in. 

So I ask myself.. why do I keep smoking if I‚Äôm seeing more negatives then positives? Today I quit and am going to try to not smoke anymore, it‚Äôs better for my mental health.

At one point I thought I was becoming schizophrenic/psychosis. Thoughts of negativity would just race all day long (Nothing serious, Stupid things) , I would start talking to myself sometimes having conversation in my head. Maybe that could be from litterly being high from waking up till going to sleep..

Have any of you guys had to give this up? And how difficult was it for you",45,0

When I smoked weed regularly, I had DAILY panic/anxiety attacks. Often several times a day.  I have always suffered from anxiety, mostly mentally though and NEVER in this caliber. I felt it so much in my body that it was almost unreal. I was also constantly feeling anxious apart from the attacks, increased and heavy heartbeat 24/7 and restlessness in my body. I felt terrible. It had started to get to that point where I was afraid of doing certain things and being at certain places in fear of having an anxiety attack in those different situations. 

Then I stopped smoking weed. First 2 weeks there were still anxiety attacks but slowly they started to become less and less often. I‚Äôm now happy to say that it‚Äôs been almost 2 months since my last anxiety attack. They are completely GONE. It‚Äôs also been 2 months since I last smoked weed. I cannot express how much better and relieved I feel. Those anxiety attacks were seriously starting to get the better of me and having an affect on my daily life. 

If you suffer from anxiety and/or panic/anxiety attacks, I highly recommend quitting weed. It‚Äôs confusing because you often hear people talking about relieving anxiety but trust me, it does NOT. I also believed that once. It might relieve anxiety mentally for a short amount of time while you‚Äôre high, but I believe and have personally experienced that weed is really taking its toll on your body and unconscious anxious mind which I believe comes out in full force in some way or another when you‚Äôre regularly smoking weed. 

I do not miss weed. I have not felt so good in a long time after deciding to stop smoking. I can control my body and my mind again. It feels amazing.",19,0

The reason I started smoking is because it was the only thing that calmed me down. Growing up, I've always had an uncomfortable amount of energy. Never felt like I could slow down until I found weed.

Now that I'm weaning off, I'm starting to become familiar with that uncomfortable amount of energy...but now it feels worse (probably because I'm not used to it anymore). Find myself getting really hot, overstimulated, and so agitated to the point that it moves me to tears.

Man am I struggling.

3 days into my first attempt a month ago, having just been permanently laid off from my first Executive Chef job (due to pandemic--was Furloughed for the first 2 months then the owners pulled the plug), I couldn't sleep so I walked down to the bayou to go fishing at 5am. Stepped on some wet grass, fell and broke my ankle. I was committed to still not smoking. They put my ankle in a big ol boot that I have to wear all the time, especially for sleep. That, coupled with my weed-detox insomnia was too much for me to take. After a couple more sleepless nights and boring days only moving between the couch and the bathroom, using crutches as to not put any weight on my foot, I caved and hit up my dealer. Told myself I'd just smoke before bed and take an edible before bed too. Well that escalated into consuming like twenty 10mg edibles and 7g weed in 7 days.

Feeling like a loser for relapsing, I didn't reup when I ran out. Today is day 2 of my new attempt to quit. I hate it. Been having an internal debate with myself all day, saying I can allow myself to smoke pot since I literally can't leave the house. I just have to stay on the couch with my leg elevated. Have a lot of pain from the break too.  So far, I haven't reached out to my dealer. But I'm not entirely sure I'll make it to my next Dr appt for my ankle on June 30 without relapsing again.

I quit a heavy drinking habit about 18 months ago. But I always had weed to fall back on.  I have nothing to fall back on now but pure sobriety and man I just feel so uncomfortable.

I've had this habit since I was 15. Started because the group I hung out with in school all smoked (wouldn't have changed a thing) I had a great time smoking but for about 10 years I've been dreaming about being substance free. I always wanted to be that natural earthy girl that had no addictions, ate right and got out in nature and exercised. 

Well about 3 months ago I quit smoking cigarettes, feels amazing not needing those things anymore. Then I decided a month ago I'll just quit drinking, because it's hard for me to even swallow alchohol (my body hates the taste) then, after that the big one came. I decided I wanted to volunteer in my community, and to do that I needed to pass a drug screen for the volunteer work I wanted to pursue. That was all I needed to kick the habit. Haven't had a single problem with it, and my husband still smokes every day right next to me.

I never thought it would be able to kick it, and at first I said ok just get clean to pass a drug test. That feeling turned into, hey I like waking up and not having the first thought come to mind to go smoke a bowl. I feel free for the first time since I started using tobacco weed and alchohol. You can do it.

I would say it was worth it as I was too high (2 months abstinence lowers your tolerance a lot) but nothing extraordinary. I already had the same experience numerous times before and nothing was new about it.

Yes, I am literally taking it an hour at a time. Attempt number is beyond counting as I have been trying EVERY.SINGLE.DAY. for a while now. I have quit for longer periods of time, the last one being for the month of July and most of August last summer. It's been a whole year almost of trying over and over and over and it wears on you. I just get this compulsion I'm beginning to recognize where my brain shoots the message to my arm to do whatever it has to to hit that sweet vape pen. 

Even if I get rid of everything, I live in a medical only state and purposefully let my medical card expire and it's still incredibly easy. I don't have any dealers to cut contact with I feel because they were all my friends first. And I still want them as a friends, they are supportive of me quitting and won't offer/have it around me if I ask, but if I ask them for some they will give it to me. I'm feeling strong enough today to make an accountability post. Unfortunately my partner also smokes and isn't ready to quit but will cut down, hide, and deny me any if I ask him but I don't want to put so much on him. 

I also grew up with a home environment where weed was very normalized and not considered wrong. I started at a young age, probably a solid weed smoker (vaper) for 13 years now. I want healthy lungs, I hate myself when I get a coughing fit. Why would I do that to myself during a freaking pandemic and probably the worst time to seek respiratory medical care? 

I AM trying hobbies and exercise. I'm working on becoming a yoga teacher (already certified) and that's kind of my passion and distraction but it doesn't matter if I exercise or have hobbies I will always always always want to smoke after. Workout at the gym - I still want to go smoke after. I'm not trying to make excuses ultimately it is on me and my decision making skills (hah).

If you are quitting and have a night terror the answer is not weed. Don‚Äôt think that because you‚Äôre system is recovering from a severe lack of REM that you need weed. You don‚Äôt.

Night terrors are scary but they don‚Äôt last forever. If you get to the point of a night terror it means you‚Äôve probably been off of the green for a few days. I‚Äôve been through this multiple times and vivid dreams/night terrors are always a part of quitting.

I wasnt smoking when we hooked up but 5 months later I relapsed due to stress and from there I just pushed her away. She was gonna move to a new province/state in a few months and because I had not disclosed to her my past struggles with mary jane, I became afraid that she will reject and therefore basically rejected her and myself before she could it to me. I blamed the relapse, but honestly,I know plenty guys in relationships who are able to communicate such things to their lovers and they are 'accepted' (I was already tired if this habit though so maybe I really ddnt want her to know how powerless I was). I WAS SO HARD ON MYSELF. My crime was trying love her and protect her from myself at the same time and this was exhausting, and to cope with the exaustion, I would smoke and further drift away from her. She left and started seeing someone. When I had finally gathered the strength to quit again, around May, I sent her some voicenotes explaining to her my past struggles..

In a few days, I will be going on a camping trip with my wife and 7 other friends. It's going to be super relaxed and lots of fun. I haven't smoked in 2 1/2 months, and I'm feeling good about it. However, I have developed a pretty heavy drinking habit which I'm not happy about. When I'm sober I want to drink, when I'm drunk I want to drink more, and when I'm really drunk I'm temporarily in a state I might consider happy. This is CLEARLY bad. Now. At this camping trip there will be booze, weed, and probably other drugs. I'm feeling weak in my weed-resistance. I'm feeling like I could end up spending the whole time drunk; and I'd probably take any other drug I'm offered.

Is tee-totaling, no inebriation of any kind, a camping trip a realistic expectation? I don't think I can be 'that guy' who tells others to put the drugs and alcohol away. If I really set my mind to it I think I could straight edge the whole trip, but I'm afraid I'll just be thinking about drugs and alcohol the whole time. 

I could really do with some guidance

Much love to you all",3,0

I‚Äôm laying in bed next to my amazing husband with my cuddle bud cat curled up on my legs. I‚Äôm counting the thunks and bumps of my heartbeat as I anxiously try to get some sleep- I have to work tomorrow. 

I lay here and think, as I do most nights, about how I‚Äôm addicted to marijuana. It isn‚Äôt a question. It‚Äôs been this way for a long time. 

I tried smoking weed for the first time when I was 14. Through a friend of my dad, I had gotten a job at a local fast food place on the weekends- mainly so I would stop asking for money to hang out with friends as often. A couple other girls worked on my shift that went to a different high school, and being a few years older, infinitely cooler. They smoked cigarettes, which I promptly started doing immediately as well, (thankfully that didn‚Äôt last long), and when they offered me a hit off a bowl behind a dumpster during shift one day, I immediately accepted. 

I. Was. Blasted. Ended up eating an entire tray of cinnamon rolls meant to be served to customers. And I loved it. I smoked weed with them several times, and I usually smoked til I just eventually knocked out. My high school (private) drug tested student athletes, so I had to kick the habit for a while, eventually throwing out my pipe, cigarettes and lighters at a gas station. I was around 16. 

It‚Äôs important to mention here that my mom has a history of addiction, and has 33 years sobriety. It‚Äôs important to remember when reading this mess. 

In college, I took off with nuclear speed. Alcohol, drugs, sex- my parents had been pretty controlling and it was my first taste of freedom and I wanted it all. By winter break freshman year I was smoking as much as I could every day. And driving around while doing it. To this day I don‚Äôt know how we didn‚Äôt get pulled over or arrested. 

Things got worst from there. I got into an abusive relationship, and in an effort to get out ended up agreeing to go to rehab at 21 to get away. I was sober a few months, and have for the most part been high every day since. I‚Äôll be 30 in August. 

Today I go to bed every night disappointed in myself that I smoked again today. I‚Äôm at the point where, while I haven‚Äôt touched a cigarette in 6 years, I cough up black and green phlegm daily. 

I used to love to sing and have destroyed my voice. And lately, smoking just makes me feel weird- like I‚Äôm gonna fall over or am experience heart palpitations. And still I do this day after day. 

Im afraid I‚Äôm going to die one day because of marijuana. And I need to stop.",5,0

I have gone periods being completely sober. My longest streak would have to be 6 months, and I felt great. I felt so clear headed and felt as if my life was going in the right direction.

This feeling has happend every single time I've quit for longer than a 1 month period. However, every time I feel as though everything is going great I always end up having this urge to smoke ""just this one time"". After I do this I love it, I then probably don't smoke for another week or two, only to smoke again.

I then think to myself ""Well if I just smoke on the weekends it won't affect me like it has in the past... I can handle it this time."" This of course works for a while...but it always escalates back to daily usage until I get extremely down and depressed. This period of depression can go on for months, until I ultimately decide to take a break.

I am currently at that tail end of the ever going cycle. I have always wanted to quit for good but I guess at this point, I don't trust myself to stay clean. I sit hear now debating on whether it is time to attempt my journey of sobriety again, knowing I will have to endure the multiple nights waking up in a pool of sweat. 

I do not have confidence in myself that I will be able to stay sober anymore. I know if I use the same methods I have in the past I will just end up in the same situation. I'm tired of the cycle. I don't know why I feel the need to post this. I guess this is my way of reaching out for help.",6,0

Fair warning that this is a novel guys, I'm verbose and couldn't help it. I'm happy to share my story and I hope in someway it helps someone, even if its just one person I'll have made a difference.Been quietly observing this subreddit for the last week or so. This is a pretty active community, one of the best I've found. Thank you all for sharing your stories. Now I'll share mine.

Have been daily toking for about 25 years, maybe a bit less but I can't remember exactly when it became daily. I'm 40 years old and started when I was in my mid teens. Since then I don't believe I've had a period of abstinence for more than a month at a time and only a two or three of those. Back in 2008 was the last time I made a serious attempt that had any results. I was 28 back then.

In 2016 I had experienced an event within my relationship to my s/o that caused me to evaluate my life and start making some changes. I started exercising 4 or 5 times a week followed by eventually quitting alcohol to which I was also dependent on for 10 years or so (now 2+ years sober from that). Also I had a renewed interest in my career, hobbies, relationships and well being in general. When I decided to stop booze I intentionally stepped up my weed usage as a crutch to help me overcome. While that approach probably isn't for everyone I believe it did help me overcome that problem (alcohol is a far more severe one, imo). I knew weed wasn't doing me any favours but I choose to ignore the problems it was creating so that I could focus on not drinking. In the meantime I've developed a bit of a hatred for booze. I know you should never say never, so I won't, but its been a long time since I've had any temptation to drink. However, I'm still very aware of the risk it poses to me.

Now that things with drinking are under control and I feel that I'm out of the proverbial woods its time for the next step. I've noticed that over the last 6 months that I've become increasingly annoyed with the negative aspects of my weed usage. What is annoying about weed to me? Well, in no particular order:

- The fact that I'm dependent on it
- Morning brain fog and needing to consume caffeine in high quantities to counteract it
- General brain fog and memory issues
- Shame and guilt of being an addict
- Influence on my children with whom I'm open and honest about my usage
- Needing to be high to enjoy anything
- Not being able to be high when I'd like to be (while at work, having to delay because I know I'll need to drive later, etc)
- Having to dedicate time and resources to growing my supply
- Always second guessing if decisions I make are the same decisions I would have made had weed not been part of my life
- Wondering what life would be like without weed being a part of it
- Having shitty social skills and not bothering to try improving them since I spend most of my time either alone or with my family, high.
- Needing weed to sleep, eat, exercise, etc

That list isn't inclusive of all the things but those were the ones that came to my mind and it likely changes day to day.

Over the last 15 years of my life I've been to therapists, addiction counselors, online support groups, spent hundreds of hours watching related youtube videos and reading online resources, and thinking about this situation that I'm in. Last Monday when I had to call in sick at work due to weed related burn-out/lack of sleep/not feeling well I decided enough was enough. I haven't had any since then. I didn't throw away my stuff yet but I tucked everything away out of sight and I'll arrange to gift it soon (I didn't want to potentially burden my financial situation and wanted to make sure this was going to be serious first). I have no desire to touch it anyway. I think I really want this and this very well might be my most serious committment to freeing myself from weed ever. In my mind, and for the way I am, if having weed in my house or not is the difference between me stopping or not than obviously I'm not committed anyway. That said please don't do what I do if you think it'll mess up your quitting.

This week wasn't fun, I forgot how serious the withdrawal is. It's close to the level of withdrawal from nicotine (which I still consume and don't plan to stop, for now! haha). In some ways its worse, sleep does not come easy but I did get a solid 6 hours last night which was fantastic. My mood is ok in general, but definitely way more irritable and angry. My productivity level is way down, I've been ""pampering"" myself so to speak, hot baths/showers, just chilling and watching my phone, eating (when I physically feel like it). Still exercising and spending a bit of time on my hobbies and chores when my motivation permits. Spending a bit more time connecting with my family and trying to keep my temper under control.

I'll wrap this up for now with this: I see so many younger people on here posting about their own plight. There is so much that they have shared and their attitudes that take me back to my younger wanna be weed quitter days. If that is you and you are reading this, please, please give this your 100%. It very well might be the most important choice you have before you at this moment in your life. Don't be like me, 40 and looking back on the last 20 years of your life with regret and remorse of having not made some changes earlier. This is serious! This pain you're feeling now is temporary, you have so much ahead of you and I promise that weed will hinder your life and cause you pain. The days and eventual decades are going to go by don't waste them for the sake of not ""being able"" to quit, if you do in fact want to quit.

25 years old male with an 9-10 year of daily usage.
So many times as you know I failed, but each time I did have learned something new about my addiction.
I remember the first time I stopped smoking weed, I had really messed up withdrawals. No sleep, cold sweats, couldn‚Äôt eat, emotional rollercoasters non stop, heavy anxiety that I could physically feel in my chest and tummy, crazy thoughts and paranoias as well as a lack of trust in my fellow humans.
That day the pandora box opened and it showed me how much stuff I had been numbing with weed and how many responsibilities I missed. How many beautiful moments of my life I wasn‚Äôt even able to recognise because of being a emotionless zombie.
All that and even way more came down crashing on me while having my withdrawals from weed.
I got to rate that experience a -10 if I had to express it softly. The first time after a really long time of smoking is probably going to be the worst one BUT it will be the most amazing thing that you can do for your self and it is going to be something you are going to be grateful for in the long run.
I remember it took me at least 3 weeks to stop feeling all these withdrawals so heavy. After 3 weeks I finally started feeling a little bit better and day by day I started believing more in living sober.
After crying and dealing with all my emotions I felt so much lighter and cleaner in my soul it was as if I dropped a couple stones from my heart.
As I relapsed a couple of times and went through these withdrawals all over again I did notice that I started to get less intense after every try.
I learned how to fall a sleep with out weed through meditating, connecting my mind to my body and actually relaxing my whole body by conscious breathing and allowing my body to let go.
I figured out that drinking water on a empty stomach in the morning plus a good work out that allows me to sweat really good, will trigger hunger in my stomach and now it has to ask for food since my body needs it to restore my muscles.
The more often you fail, the more you learn about how your mind will try to trick you into doing it again.
The more often you fail, the more you learn about how your body reacts to not smoking weed and how to go about helping it restore it‚Äôs self quicker.
And of course a MAJOR lesson that really opened my eyes to having courage and trying to stop again : it get‚Äôs easier and easier because you become better and better at not smoking.
Before I stopped this time I was heavily doubting my self that I won‚Äôt be able to stop forever because I failed before.
Today I am on day 3, went through the worst on the first day but nothing like that first time after a really long time of daily usage.
I am hacking this game to bits and pieces with faith.
Faith that is connected to that I can feel better sober than stoned. Faith that is connected to being able to do something about my withdrawals and stand strong in my shoes even though it is a rough thing to go through. Also optimism played a big role in my story which helped me to get through the hardest times and value the smallest benefits. Before I had a hard time stopping without even having weed and weed buddies arround me. Today I am on day 3 while living in Holland, in a house full of weed addicts and the best smells from the morning till the evening as well as a alcocholic toxic mother that does not support at all and is hard for me to be arround. All of that harsh environment allowed me to go through these lessons and actually figure out that I do really want to stop smoking. And if you do really want to stop smoking and make a change you will have to stop making excuses about your situation and start suffering the pain that makes you stronger and stronger. I stopped smoking weed in a environment that is all about smoking weed. I went through a lot in life and pain was always there, it is just a signal. I failed but I learned from it so that is already a big step towards becoming a better human.
Every single setback and every single tough situation was a opportunity to become stronger and see where I need to step my game up.
Your pain that stems from stopping weed is a pain of growth, so don‚Äôt think you are all doing this for nothing even if you relapse in the future.
You are working on a muscle that will become stronger and bigger.

Here I am on my third day after numerous relapses before, being stable and feeling good.
Slept the first night easy after a lil meditation.
Eating even if I have to push that food inside I am strong enough to do so.
I do feel a bit of anxiety through out the day but nothing I can‚Äôt handle since I also stopped before being on a reality tv show for a month 24/7 on cameras. That time my anxiety levels were so high I had to meditate atleast 15 times a day when ever I got the chance to calm my heart from beating out of my chest xD!

IT WILL GET BETTER, YOU WILL GET BETTER & STRONGER AND IT WILL GET EASIER !
NEVER EVER GIVE UP AND KEEP PUSHING !
YOU GOT THIS !

‚ÄúPain makes me grow, growing is what I want. Therefore, for me Pain is pleasure.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe pain that you hold is yours. There is not a single pain quite like it. Nobody else on God's green earth can feel this pain, or have the indescribable feeling of pride you will have when you overcome it. This pain is not your curse; this pain is your privilege.‚Äù

I'm struggling. I'm sweating excessively. My head is pounding. I'm not eating properly. I'm not sleeping properly. I literally want to smash my head against a brick wall right now.

Yet today when I told two of my friends that I made it to day 3, one of them just said, ""Ah."" then changed the subject. She didn't appreciate how much work it takes and honestly I won't be talking to her again about it. 

The other said ""See, I knew you could do it."" 
This in itself isn't helpful, because I'm only on day 3. It's not like I just quit and that's it, I've done it. I'm fighting every day against myself and it's NOT easy. I knew she meant well, but trying to explain it's not a destination and rather a journey was not received well. 

So, in spite of this. I'd like to congratulate myself for making it this far. Another day, another battle fought. 

If anyone else is experiencing anything similar PLEASE pop me a message, we have to support each other. As much as some may try to help, if they haven't done it, it's hard for them to understand the impact words can have. 
Encouragement really does make a huge difference on a person's mood, and therefore their ability to believe they can succeed. 

Honestly, well done to everyone that's taking this journey! Let's take one day at a time together.

And yesterday frustrations at home and some issues that happened between friends of mine that I realized were my fault from a time when I was so high all the time I didn't realize I wasn't paying anymore attention all just compacted enough that decided I was gonna go get drunk at the bar and after that had another ""fuck-it"" moment and decided to light up too.


Worst part is it felt good to unwind and unstress and I just don't know where my heads at anymore. But then on the flip I woke up groggy and feel guilty that I slipped up again after coming this far.

As the title says, I had almost 8 years of sobriety. I used to go to AA meetings to help me in my recovery but I moved states and the meetings were different I told myself and stopped going. I wasn't smoking or drinking but I was not the person I wanted to be. I was working and holding down the longest job I've ever had so at least I had that.

In January 2018 I talked myself into thinking that sense marijuana was now legal in my state it would be safe and manageable for me to start using it again. Of course I was dead wrong. Almost immediately I was using all day every day. I told myself I would stick to sativas and it was my medicine. I hid it from my family, or so I thought, and felt like I had a good thing going. Then one night about a year later I got myself into a jackpot that put my job, my faith, and my sanity in jeopardy and it was directly a result from using marijuana. My life had once again become unmanegable. I spiraled down and bottomed out. Suicidal thoughts that I hadn't had in years were there. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I was lost.

Somehow I got the courage to reach out to my sponsor from where I moved from and I poured my guts out to him over the phone. He listened to it all, told me he felt bad that I was such horrible spot, and suggested going to a meeting if I thought it would help. No judgement, just listened and steered me towards help. I hadn't takled to him in 5 years but he was there when I needed him.

I went to work the next day, but the day after was a day off and I got the courage to go into a meeting. It was the best thing I could've done. I talked to people after and went to other meetings they suggested. That led me to what is now my home group that meets every morning and that's where I met new sponsor. With their help one day at a time I've got a new sobriety date of 1/6/2020 and close to 6 months of sobriety. I'm not lost like I was, I'm back on the path trudging the roads to my happy destiny. Things might not all be better, but I'm better and that's what is most important.

The other night I tried my first Marijuana Anonymous meeting on Zoom and it was great. It was really cool to hear pot talked about so much and not have to substitute it like I do for my AA meetings. AA knows pot is my drug of choice, but I just say alcohol and drugs there out of respect for the program. Being able to have a meeting with a focus on marijuana felt great.

Anyway, thanks for reading this if you did. I hope to be more active on this account and in my recovery on reddit as another tool to help me stay sober one day at a time and help others.",5,0

Well made it to 300 days. I'm glad for the healing thats occurred, yet I find myself feeling mixed.

It's hard to believe all this might ever truly go away. But maybe it will.

So my quick history was I had a short stint with Cannabis over 3 months, and ended up having a large dose on my birthday. Quit cold turkey. 37 year old Male.  Just wanted to experiment. Never would have done it at all if someone had informed me of all this stuff about PAWS withdrawl.

Went through an avalanche of symptoms, and now 10 months later, I feel much better.

What I still deal with is sort of hard to describe, head pressure, sort of a lack of hedonic feeling, though it seems to improve, a bit of dissociation DR.  I still have some visual flare ups. I saw static yesterday for the first time again in awhile and it somewhat upset me, though not as much as the first couple of times. Reminds me I have a brain problem.

I worry maybe I have a permanent  problem. Like HPPD. But only time will tell. It sometimes feels like maybe thats whats still going on. The sensations up in my head sometimes remind me of being on cannabis. Like I feel euphoric feelings, but they feel not quite right. And I still often smell weed even when it's not here, like a phantom smell. I dosed high (about a gram), so perhaps it messed me up permanently? I hope not.  At least any Derealization I have is small. People over there say high doses of weed could cause it. So maybe?

I still ruminate. I recognize the problem, but it's hard to make go away. I do lots of meditation to counteract it. Daily walks, etc.

But to the good news, so many of my old symptoms are gone. So maybe these remaining ones will go away eventually?

I keep living the healthy life, good sleep, exercise, yoga, meditation, quality food, journaling, etc. I'll stopped therapy for a brief while but plan to resume this summer.

I was hoping to be super positive at this point, but I find myself mixed. It's all like a bad dream. Like how did this happen to me? I've been through so much in life, and achieved so much, and at age 37, I decided to mess up everything with a little weed? Not mess up though I hope. Life has been good this year in the sense nothing has gone wrong, but i don't feel good about what has happened and what might be a condition for the rest of my life. And I feel such guilt for my girlfriend who has had to go through this with me.

One day at a time.

Anyways, I'll keep the faith. I'm trying to become a better person. I'm putting aside a dollar a day and one day I will donate it all to a mental health organization of somekind.

And to everyone worried out there, maybe I'll be cured, maybe not. Also not many people end up with what I'm getting hit with. So don't stress too much if you are worried.

Weed is legal, natural, and has a lot of hype. But boy can it sure mess you up. Lucky me to be the one to learn the hard lesson and to share the tale. I love you all. Wish me well please. I want to have a good life and be a good person. And I fear I may have messed that up.

I keep hoping I'll wake up one day and the bad dream will end. But I also know this is life. Anything can happen. 

I will stay positive. I have so much gratitude for all of you here, and for the amount of healing that I have achieved. Much love again.",6,0

it's been 3 days since I stopped using cannabis to mess with my dopamine system. i have used it for that for around 16 years pretty much daily, with a few short breaks where I've been on holiday or ran out and couldn't buy more. 

I've tried quitting a few times for the past 3 years, most i make it to is a couple of weeks before i relapse. this time I've changed my strategy to instead educate myself on the science of addiction and motivation through watching YouTube. 

it's been eye opening. I've learned that motivation is driven by dopamine - the same chemical system I've been fucking with. I've learned that my brain will defend itself from the excess dopamine too by actively trying to reduce the amount of dopamine.

I've learned how important dopamine is for my survival and how with low levels of dopamine i will experience what i feel as a lack of motivation. I've learned that in fact dopamine and motivation are kind of interchangeable. 

I've learned how dopamine is necessary for survival and that despite my brain doing its best to fight the excess dopamine, it still wants -some- dopamine, it's just expecting it to come from cannabis use. 

I have no medical background so all of the above could be totally wrong but it all makes sense to me and gives me confidence that quitting weed is the right thing for me. ive abused weed to mess with my dopamine system before so that's enough evidence for me that I'm quite likely to do it again and again. I find it a reassuring narrative that im not missing out on something fun, im just avoiding a substance that i have years of evidence proving that im likely to abuse to fuck with my dopamine levels.

I think I assumed that the weed was the problem - I was just making weed and booze friends instead of real connections. So QUIT it's ruining you. So I did. Now I realise I am already ruined! The weed just made it bearable to spend acres of time alone. Made me think I was paranoid that nobody wanted to hang out. But in fact, nobody does, especially now when 'hanging out' is an actual thing you have to plan for and commit to in lockdown. So wow turns out the cravings are nothing compared to this feeling of WTF do I do now?! How can I make new lasting relationships with clean friends at a 2m distance??

Did I casually venture into suicidal territory?- yes, but only for like three seconds and and slapped myself out of it. The apathy, misery, and self hate were very real. 

I‚Äôm happy to report that- the first half today was meh, but it started to turn around, and wanting to be high became less of a recurring thought. I just tried to keep busy, I left the house, did some errands, saw my family, exercised + got some sun. 

Days 2 + 3- I felt like I was in rehab. I just locked myself in my room, sat in bed and cried,  dry heaved at the sight of food but was starving, shivering, sweating, tons of anxiety + paranoia, showering three times a day, crying again- a fuckin mess.

‚ÄúWeed doesn‚Äôt create problems for you, but it prevents you from finding solutions‚Äù, something along those lines, and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go back to sleep‚Äù, sleep being, numbing/escaping/distracting with substances. 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go back to sleep‚Äù is something I‚Äôd say to myself throughout the day when I‚Äôd have a craving, and I have to say it‚Äôs really helped.

Had to cry to take it out.

Then I went for a 2 hour walk with my dad, saw many flowers, trees and plants and felt so much better. Was really beautiful cause we never do this kind of things, he did it just cause he knew how bad I felt.  


In the night my parents had a fight and stressed me out and (even tho I dont smoke tobacco anymore), I locked myself in my bedroom and hit an old pipe that had a bit of tobacco mixed with hash ... had 3 hits and realized I just had tobacco (the hash didnt really turned on cause this pipe is weird) so I needed another pipe to smoke my hash.. I thought that since I already fucked it up it was the same if I smoke the night away... And was about to take the hash out that fucked up pipe, and go find the one were you can smoke hash without problem....

But I rather put it back and didnt smoke any more... Feeling a bit guilty but at the same time I feel proud cause I didnt went after the pipe where I would get my hash hits.

Im thinking I need to learn from this and keep on with the detox. But learn a way to cope when Im having trouble in the outside world, like a technique, cause whenever my parents were fighting, I just went to smoke a joint and did like there was nothing going on... But now, I couldnt do that anymore...

SO, What do you do when you get this kind of external stress, that you were used to smoke away?

I start smoking all-day every day immediately when I relapse (about 2 wks this time, smoked my last bowl around noon).

I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to control it, and 2 weeks later here I am out hundreds dollars, slinking back to civilization from the woods. It was a ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù moment that got me- I had been battling with powerful cravings for a month and ultimately caved. I remembered the sweats, the chills, the insomnia, lack of appetite- but damn every time I forget just how intensely I feel shame when i smoke. By day 3 of smoking I was just trying to let my lungs breathe but the shame of totally losing my ability to interact/smelling like pot/cigs (which I just quit ugh) just kept me in the woods.

I used to hide my cravings due to shame/fear of them, but I‚Äôm being open now, so that‚Äôs definitely progress. I‚Äôm really trying to deal with this shame piece, since I believe it‚Äôs at the root of the disease of addiction.

All the other times I have quit I‚Äôd drive myself crazy trying to decide what changes I would make in my life and how I would like change the world, or truly live my life to the fullest. I‚Äôm not doing that this time- it‚Äôs useless since I will likely just go back to my daily life with a little more knowledge on how to prevent another relapse.

I went out tonight and at first I managed to resist it(my friend group smokes pretty much every time we go out) but I got a bit drunk and a few hours later I just couldn't resist so I smoked a bit. I feel really bad about this because I promised myself and also my gf that I would quit at least for a month cold turkey and then after that only smoke once a week if there is a birthday party or something similar going on. It is beginning to affect my life more and more and I just want to put a stop to it.

Fortunately, this group plus meditation and exercise (and just staying busy w work too) has kept me from relapsing. 

And then today, I went to a BBQ and I had a non-alcoholic beer...one that someone I know recommended, and that I bought and brought to the party. And I felt a touch tipsy from it, which is insane bc it says on it that it has less than .5% alcohol content. Anyways, idk WHAT was in it, but when we were coming home from the BBQ, I was feeling spacey and similar to how I‚Äôve felt when I‚Äôve been high. That feeling of not really being able to land/connect w myself and my surroundings. Which prior to today I thought I wanted. I had wanted so badly this week to just smoke and be high for a few hours. And then today I felt it and I felt awful. I had to drink a ton of water to feel grounded and healthy again, and I still don‚Äôt feel 100%. 

Annnnyways, idk if this will help anyone else who is thinking of smoking, or if anyone else relates or has experience with NA beers? But let me know if you do. For me, I‚Äôm so glad this happened bc it reminds me how awful actually being high was for me at the end. I don‚Äôt need that or want it!!

First off I love this community, it's been a huge help so far. So far it's been 14 days since I've last smoked, and prior to that I was smoking almost everyday for the past 4 years. I quit because I was smoking to numb my emotions and it was the opposite of enjoyable when I was high. Even though it was like that for the past year or two, I was still getting high. 

I haven't hung out with my friends so that I would have some time to reset my routine and I've made so much progress. But not seeing any friends and only seeing my girlfriend has gotten to me and I've made plans to go to a friends house with another friend and my cousin. I feel like if I smoke tonight it won't be because I'm doing it out of the addiction I had, I feel like it's just to have fun and make playing video games fun. It's such a childish thing to do that I feel like weed may enhance it. I also feel like if they're all high then I'll feel out of place. 

What should I do? Not smoke and maybe I'll have fun and then I'll see that I can have fun without it too? It'll show my friends that I'm serious about not smoking as well. It'll show myself how much willpower I have too. But will it really be that bad if I smoke? Fuck I'm torn.",1,0

I also have to admit to myself that I do have an addictive personality, and i have problems dealing with anxiety etc so I turn to weed. If theres no weed, Whisky.

&#x200B;

Let me type that again for the people in the back: The possibility of unexpectedly feeling good is all but ruled out completely when I am living in addiction.

&#x200B;

There was a day before I relapsed when I rode my bike with some friends. On said day I felt myself caught off guard because I realized that I felt good and was having a good time. I felt good simply because what I was doing was meaningful. The conversations I was having were meaningful. I felt the fullness of the endorphins I was getting from exercise. I was connecting with the beauty of my city. I felt good because I was lost in what I was doing rather than focusing on the past or the future. This feeling is not a feeling I can roll up in a joint. It was not a quickly fleeting feeling and I didn't have an experience that I couldn't remember so well the next day either. It was pure, unadulterated joy.

&#x200B;

Cognitive behavioral therapy is founded on the concept of mental distortions. One of these distortions is called ""fortune telling."" Simply put, if someone thinks they're going to have a bad time, they are almost definitely going to have a bad time. Think about it. When have you gone to work or class thinking it was going to be terrible and you ended up having a great experience? Sure, there might be a few times this has happened but I am willing to bet that such a scenario is rare. Our thoughts are incredibly powerful. That is not just mysticism or religion. That is science and it is real.

&#x200B;

My theory is this: when one wallows in addiction to weed, the only joy that exists is the joy of being high. This might sound dramatic but hear me out. Being high is one specific feeling. Sure there are different highs and different experiences one can have while high but there is a bass note of euphoria that remains the same. Playing video games is no longer fun because one is doing well or having a unique experience -- it is fun because they are high while doing it. Paddle boarding is no longer fun because of the landscape and company of good friends -- it's fun because the addict is nice and high. Conversation is no longer edifying on its own but it just might feel that way because one is high. When I am living in addiction, even if I am doing something cool, I am plagued by the thought ""this would be better if I was high.""

&#x200B;

So, what is the real cost of a THC addiction? My personal cost is clear to me. I trade every other joy in the world for the joy of being high. And, for those of use who are true addicts, we know that eventually even that joy goes away -- no matter how many dabs we take.",11,0

Yesterday was the hardest because we had friends over and it was the first time in years I wasn't joining them on the balcony to smoke, all while dealing with lack of sleep, kinda feeling like I can't trust anyone (? I know this one's in my head but it's still hard), and physically feeling sick (nausea and jittery).

I was feeling better the first week than I am now. And today's the first full day where I don't have any plans or responsibilities and my mind just keeps turning to weed, because I used to look forward to these 'guilt free' days so much. I can't throw the weed away because it's my partner's and he's still smoking. I know I can do this even with weed in the house because genuinely accepting that I have an addiction has given me such a kick in the guts that regardless of whether I'll be better/worse off without weed I know I don't want to be controlled by an addiction.

That still doesn't make the feeling any easier, and I feel paralysed by the thought of going the whole day without it and can't seem to think about anything else. I try talking to some friends, and they believe me to a certain level, but they don't really believe weed can be that kind of addictive you know and so still make some jokes about it or compare my experience to having a bad high.

The thing is I was always really skinny and small as a kid and I hated it, so I began working out to feel better about myself and put on some weight.  Naturally I turned to weed and became addicted since it gave me something that allowed me to eat more and feel better all the time.  On top of this my entire friend group are stoners and we smoke every time we hang out.

Over the past 2-3 years I've been dealing with chronic nausea and im constantly having episodes that last a few days to a week where Im struggling to hold down food and often vomit.  On top of this I can't even drink anymore, literally I have 1-2 drinks then I vomit.  

I've been seeing doctors for the past 2 years and all sorts of tests have been done.  Both of my doctors seemed convinced its Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome.  If your not familiar its a condition where rampant weed use leads to nausea and bowel disruptions.  My cousin was diagnosed with it a couple years ago and had to quit weed, although he does still smoke from time to time.

My big issue is the fact that Im terrified to lose weight and become skinny.  Its day 2 right now and my appetite is none existent, I vomit all the time and I can feel my body wasting away it almost feels like.  

This isn't my first time quitting weed.  I quit for 2 months a year ago because of Cannibinoid Hyperemesis Sydrome (CHS), but when I wasn't feeling better I just started smoking again because fuck it why not.  However, both my doctors are now telling me I have to quit cold turkey for at least 6 months to confirm that its not CHS.  

This is where my dilemma comes in, I feel fucking sick all the time, but weed is literally the only thing that fixes my stomach.  Ive been prescribed pharmaceutical anti-nauseant's and tried literally every home remedy under the sun, but nothing does anything.  I can't eat anything without throwing it up.  Now I'm told I have to quit for 6 months, not one smoke session.  

On top of quarantine and having nothing to do all day not smoking feels fucking impossible.  Im sitting in pain, grumpy all day every fucking day because my stomach hurts and I can't eat anything.  

Needed to vent this somewhere, all I want is to feel better and have my life back (always worried about getting sick on dates, with other people, eating in front of others), and all these insecurities just compound into anxiety that makes it worse, anxiety that isn't there when im high. 

Im not myself, I'm emotional as fuck and crying all the time.  I swear even my friends can tell ive been acting weird.  None of the times I quit before were nearly this hard.  I just can't believe I have to last 6 months to see if this is what it is.  

Is there anyone else out there with CHS who can comment on quitting and when they started feeling better.  I'm fine with quitting weed but it feels stupid if there is something else wrong with me and i stop using the only thing (weed) that makes me feel better, and I dont want to be fucking skinny again.

I  didn't start using as an adolescent, in fact, I was 40 (yes, I'm an idiot) when I started daily use, and I didn't use any until my 20's. Due poor availability (illegal country), I used to use maybe once or twice a year, but the more available it got, the more frequently I'd smoke/vape. First it was once a month, then once a week.. until it was all day, everyday. Now, as I've mentioned in a few previous posts, I don't even get high anymore, but I just cannot quit using.

From that age I never went a day without smoking weed, I don‚Äôt know how I found the money for it, I grew up in a really small town in England where it was very illegal, but with no parental supervision, I jus smoked however much I wanted.

Enter a profession which made me travel the world with groups of people, all who smoked a lot of weed, and I spent 7 years travelling smoking in all the different countries I visited. 

It sounds romantic, but honestly I almost got arrested several times for taking weed from New York to PARIS and other places. Also the sheer amount of Jonesing I experienced when getting off a long flight made me ALWAYS get off the plane and go find weed before going back to my hotel room. No matter where I was in the world, I had a weed connect.

Fast forward to age 27. My life is falling apart. My emotions are out of whack, my life perspective is warped, I‚Äôm emotional, depressed, cynical, and I jus CANT STOP SMOKING WEED. It was too painful every time I tried to stop.

Fast forward a few more years, and a few more traumatic life events, and I decided I WILL NOT SMOKE.

Didn‚Äôt touch weed for an entire year. Realised that stopping weed has some strong physical withdrawals (I thought I was crazy but it‚Äôs real) and my dreams were insane.  In fact, the longer time I spent away from weed, the more vivid my dreams became, and the subject matter of them were things that had happened to me a decade go. Over the years I kind of dreamed in chronological order all the major events of my life. It was very odd, and after a few months the dreams stopped. I think this was my brain going back and processing information I‚Äôd stored away by being stoned 24/7 and numb. 

All my friends still smoked and suddenly I could recognise the paranoia and numbness in my friends which I was experiencing for the last 15 years.

Brothers came to visit in America in Vegas in 2019, both smoke, both tried to get me to smoke, I stayed strong the whole trip. BUT, I had all their left over weed with me they couldn‚Äôt take, and I took it back to California.

Fast forward 3 months of smoking every single day and getting back into old patterns in life. STOP, TOO MUCH, GET SOBER AGAIN.

I was sober Oct 19 - March 20 until mid-quarantine I was depressed and bored so I thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs been ages, I‚Äôm healthier, why not?‚Äù

Bought some weed and now I‚Äôm on month 3 of smoking an eighth of herb a day. 

Today is the first day I‚Äôm not smoking. I have cold sweats, irritability, a feeling of panic, and jus a general unease. But it‚Äôs ok, because I‚Äôve quit 2ce before my body and brain are ready for this. 

Sorry for the long one, 

I just wanted to share this and get it off my chest.

Weed can be extremely negative to your life. But never think all hope is lost, because the longer you‚Äôre away from weed, the more you brain is rewired to see hope and possibility, other than jus numbness and apathy.

Like many, I started smoking young (14) occasionally with friends, it then became weekends, and before I knew it, it had its grip on me, I became an every day toker. 
I still remember the 14 year old boy who was full of life, where did he go? how I wish I could go back & re live the last 10 in a different way, but I digress as I know I must now accept. 

About 3 months ago, something changed in me. Maybe it was a combination of being cooped up due to Covid, loosing my executive role that I had spent the last 7 years building up my career to get, moving back into my parents place and for the first time in my adult life, I had no idea what was to come next. 

Well, the anxiety started, the paranoia, the panic attacks, and for a while there, I really thought I was loosing my mind. Of course I convinced my self it wasn‚Äôt the herb, ‚Äúone more bag, right‚Äù confirmation bias is a bitch, but I knew something had to change, and I knew what it was.

The past 3 weeks have been tough to say the least, the anger, the depression, the sleeplessness, the night sweats and my god, the nightmares. If I‚Äôm honest, I‚Äôm still going through it and I have to keep telling my self that 10 years of abuse is not going to be repaired with a few weeks of sobriety. I know there is both physical and mental issues that I will now have to address due to my abuse and I will do my best to deal with them as they come. 

I have used this time to reflect on my past and the decisions I have made, the relationships lost,  the time wasted and the fact that this drug has completely stripped me of my personality. I read story after story on this sub that match mine, and I worry for my generation and the ones to follow. we have all heard and repeated the same lines, ‚Äúweeds not addictive, I could quit tomorrow if I wanted‚Äù what a lie we have been sold. 

I will end with this...each day gets a little better, today I hiked 10k without a joint, hiking was always the one thing I had to do night, so today I celebrate the little wins and the simple things. 

Remember Mary will always be there, it‚Äôs the time lost that we will never get back.",65,1

Sleeping - sleeping has been awful, but I've been lucky enough to not experience any nightmares. However, full disclosure, I'm using sleep aids so that may change when I stop them next week. I have been remembering more of my dreams which hasn't happened in years.

Sweating - The night sweats are awful. I still have them but I'm not waking up to a full person sized sweat spot. I'm slightly more sweaty during the day as well, especially my hands.

Appetite- I was incredibly nauseous for the first 5 days. And couldn't keep anything down for the first three. After that my appetite has been slowly returning. I actually find that I'm hungry in the morning instead of being able to wait until afternoon to eat. Nourishing my body as needed will be a new habit to form. 

Mood - I'm in a bitchy mood. There's no other way to put it. I can't control it and it's extremely frustrating. It doesn't seem to hit until the afternoon/ evening. This has gotten worse the last few days as opposed to better. 

Cravings - It pops into my head now and then but for the most part I'm not craving it. I still have paraphernalia I need to dispose of to be honest. It's cheesy but when I hear that voice I talk to it out loud and remind it that I do not want to smoke and any voice that tells me otherwise does not have my best interest at heart and is NOT ""me."" 

Life - I actually want to go out and do things. I'm bored at home and I find if I don't do something the cravings are much worse. Keeping busy is obviously ideal. 

Working out - it helps tremendously. Both with the rage as well as sweating out the toxins (that may not be science, but it rings true)

All in all I'm trucking through it. It's been the longest I haven't smoked in years and I'm proud of myself. The withdrawal symptoms are slowly going away and I know they won't last forever.

That said, these past days have been tough. I hate myself for struggling to process simple day-to-day events. I feel really sluggish all the time.. like I'm functioning on 10% of the average person's brain capacity. I find it extremely difficult to structure my thoughts and articulate myself to people. I'm honestly not sure what to make of it - is this brain fog or are the effects of years of prioritizing short-term gratification over building myself catching up to me now that my actions matter? (I'm at a point in my life where I'll be entering the workforce soon, facing real responsibility over myself...)

I just want someone to tell me what to do. What I should say to people, how to present myself... I'm not even sure if this has anything to do with weed at all. All I know is that I'm exhausted from beating myself up about everything I have or have not done. I suppose my past with weed is enforcing this shame and guilt and anxiety and self-loathing.

I am on day 29 today after quitting a 3-5 joints a day habit for approximately 18 straight years.  
  
One thing thats great is that I remain convinced this is the right decision, and I have no desire to return to smoking. I like being sober now, my appetite has returned, I can sleep. But am still having trouble with 2 things.  
  
1) I am still dealing with chest and abdominal pains. Not severe but enough that it is quite annoying and I am just wondering how long it can possibly go on for. I realize that  I was a long-term chronic user and it could take a while..but could this be months?  
  
2) I am sleeping a solid 8 hours a night, with intense vivid dreams still most nights. But I am beginning to question how deep I am sleeping. Not only do I feel tired and like garbage every day when I wake up, but I seem to be able to enter a dream state while Im almost still awake. I could wake up at 7 am, and be back into an intense dream by 7:02 - How could this be REM sleep?  
  
The anxiety and sweats are basically gone...so is the nausea... but I am just amazed at how over 4 weeks later I am still dealing with this. I was always the ""weed is great its not addictive, there is no downside"" person too...how wrong I was. ..I hate how making a healthy choice can lead to feeling so unhealthy, but I am committed to this.",2,0

Smoked for 10 years, stopped and fell back numerous times.
Fell back at the second urges after two months the last time, smoked and thought man this shit sucks anyway. I am back at the beginning and man hell nah it wasn‚Äôt worth it.
Felt like shit ,smoking and feeling bad about my self and what I was doing.
I knew deep down it is not going to bring me anything good.
After being heavily addicted for a couple months now I again feel fed up with being numb, passive and depressed.
It‚Äôs 21:31 here I haven‚Äôt touched a joint today and fuck me it has been a emotional rollercoaster ride today.
I live with my mom and my younger brother which also smoke a heck ton of weed but they are cool with it.
I want to stop smoking weed because it is taking away my motivation to do anything through out the day.
It used to help me be creative and make more music but it‚Äôs not the same anymore. It has taken away the fun from my life and my teenage years.
My mom drinks every single day and is a really hard person for me to be around since a lot of my traumas are surfacing non stop just by being in her presence.
This situation was mostly my trigger to keep on smoking and numbing my self ,escaping the reality I am living in just like my mom. The thing I really feel sad about is that my mom is encouraging me to smoke so I act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. As I am typing this she is actually rolling a joint in front of me asking if I am still this sure I am not smoking weed today, she genuinely enjoys making it harder for me which I find really painful.This situation here is very toxic and man yes I want to move out asap once I find a job to keep my self stable. That was my plan until I fell back into smoking weed and depression.
It‚Äôs been a tough time living, feeling like I want to die and feeling hopeless/depressed.
I am going to do my best to keep a some sort of routine that keeps me away from smoking and do my best to find a job so I could finally leave this hell and find my peace.
My heart hurts so bad and I feel broken as fuck but I do want to be a responsible man and turn my life into something beautiful.
I am praying for everyone trying to leave this habit to have strenght, hope, a tremendous amount of will power and faith.

Does anyone here know how long the psychological effects of smoking last? I mean i have cut down ALOT since last year. Didnt smoke more than 15 g in 1 month, spread out into several small sessions of having a bowl with friends here and there, and then 2 separate sessions of smoking upto 5gs in 3-4 days respectivly.

I read lots of posts but just joined. As many of you know, maryjane addiction is real and it's the worst. It creeps up on you and you think it's not addictive. To sum it up quickly, started smoking at age 13. It took me to places I never thought I'd go. I smoked it, sold it, etc etc. In 2008 I got busted for selling it. I got house arrest and was in a 12step program ( best yrs of my life) for 4.5yrs. I relapsed in 2012. I've been smoking heavy since then. I have honestly tried to quit 20 times since then. I realize it isn't working for me and I throw it out. There must be 15 pipes in the creek behind my house. I smoke for a while, then I say to myself "" what are you doin"". This has gone on and on for years. I have nothing against the pot... It's just not good for me. I cannot control it. It controls me. I put it 1st before anything. I have 3 children and 1 on the way. I'm 40 yrs old and I'm done. I am the sole breadwinner of my house and have always paid bills and made sure we have lights, food,  water, etc. I weened down alot and it's been hard on me. I'm freaking out. Mentally emotionally physically and spiritully. My main reason for quitting is that, for me, it is a sin. My wife hates it and I have no support network. I feel so alone and didn't know what else to do but write this. It helps me to know that other people are doing the same thing as I am. The scariest thing for me is that I did everything while smoking pot. Like fishing hiking working eating shitting. You name it. It was a crucial part of my life. Like a best friend to me. I hate it and love it at the same time. I just need to know others have done it and are still doing it (quitting for good). Any encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading",5,0

No joints for almost two weeks now, despite living with a pretty heavy user.  Last night we watched ""The King of Staten Island"" (Pete Davidson's new movie) and ordered pasta from Scaddabush. This combo was extremely triggering (weird to eat a bunch of pasta without smoking first! It seems wrong somehow). I actually loved the movie (and don't regret watching it!) but I really wanted to get high (there is a lot of weed smoking in the film). Interestingly, the film has a bit to say about the downfall of smoking weed, and doesn't glamourize it in any way. There's a scene where Pete's character asks ""does anyone ever get high anymore?"" while they're all smoking up, and the consensus in the room is that no, they haven't actually gotten high in years, but they just keep smoking. Which hit pretty close to home and is a big reason I quit! I noticed I was just feeling tired and sniffly all the time, not ""good"" in any way. Regardless it's hard to let go of an old friend. 

It's hard to sleep at night (understatement!) I lay awake in my bed reading until sleep overtakes me, usually sometime around 5-6 a.m., then wake up in a pool of my own sweat some time later. I'm thankful for this lockdown time as I have nowhere to be in the morning, so I can sleep then and no one has to experience how irritable I am. 

So anyway it's been a bit rough but every day I feel a bit stronger, a bit more clear-headed. A lot of feelings are coming up but after all, they are just feelings. They won't kill me! I really think this is the right decision. I just hope I actually stick with it this time!!

I‚Äôm 29 and I‚Äôve been smoking/vaping daily for about 9 years. I‚Äôve tried to stop a few times and relapsed last summer after a few months sober. I‚Äôve been using fake carts bought from my corner bodega for the past 2-3 years. It came to a point where I‚Äôd vape all day long, and before doing pretty much anything; before work, during my lunch break, during a dinner with my family in law, before going to the grocery store with my wife... you see the picture. All the time, everywhere, hiding from my wife, friends and coworkers. I couldn‚Äôt imagine a day without vaping, I‚Äôd even keep my old empty carts knowing that I could always hit them as a last resort if I was running out of oil. The thought of running out of cartridges made me freak out. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything sober, everything just seemed so boring and pointless. I‚Äôd spend my days in a trance, waiting for my next puffs. My tolerance became so high that I‚Äôd vape a 1g cartridge in 48 hours. I felt like a loser lying to my wife who‚Äôs always been so supportive of me when I first tried to stop weed. I looked at myself hiding in the bathroom, hitting my pen as fast as I can, and I knew I had a problem. But I‚Äôve been lying to myself for years. I‚Äôve been sober from alcohol for a year and two months, and the idea of quitting weed was terrifying. I saw all the articles in the news about fake carts being dangerous, and read so many scary stories on Reddit, yet my addict brained continued to vape. I‚Äôm tired of seeing myself like that. I make me sad. I want to stop relying on weed to make me feel happy, alive. I feel weak and tired all the time, I often have nausea, headaches, and feel dizzy. Yesterday evening I decided that it was enough. I looked at my wife in the eyes and told her everything.

Today is 2 months sober after at least 7 years of smoking bongs every single day and I‚Äôve done it on my own which I‚Äôm incredibly proud of as I never thought it would even be a possibility. The thing is I only quit due to being new in a very small town and nothing being available due to lockdown. However, I took this as a good opportunity and decided not to try harder to find some and just accept it and see how I went. 

Now after two months I still don‚Äôt feel ANY of the positives people talk about when they quit. My motivation was fine as a smoker, it helped my concentration (ADHD) and helped me do and finish things. Now I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything. All my motivation is gone, my anxiety is at an all time high, my dreams are horrendous (when I can sleep), I don‚Äôt feel clearer or smarter, my memory is no better and I just am not getting the benefits people talk about.

""TO MAKE"" - Thats the verb I will focus here in my post that makes him kind different of the other we read here. Many here focus on the health and depression issues caused by weed (wich I also had and believe 100%).

But my main issue (by far) was ever the incapacity of ""Ending tasks"".

ALL these 5 years I see now as a time where I wasnt able to finish well done the majority of the things I started.
Stoner minds never want to grab hard things to do where mental force is required. This is why many here say they stay 47385 hours in front of Netflix or staring to the rooftop of their houses.

This ""unavaibility"" of my head to end things almost thrown me out of University for not being able to write my final exam (work of course conclusion).

I left being a ""do'er"" to become a stoner and this is the main regret. 

But things improve when you quit.
Life is being a lot more bright and I am very honored to be sober (yes, I dont go out with ""weed heads"" anymore but im okay with that, I have another friend wich doesnt smoke and we acomplish lots of things and dont become only stoned while finishing anythin)

Thanks you all. Hugs from Brazil",5,0

I've already tried to quit 2 times. The first time I really didn't want to. But I had to. So the moment I didn't need to stop anymore, I was using again. The second time was when I had to move back in with my parents. I didn't want to quit but I knew it was for the best. When I got my own home again, I though I could just keep it for the weekend. Biggest lie ever. Now I know I have to for my mental health. I was so depressed, that I almost killed myself. When I got better, I couldn't believe that the things I thought to justify my su√Øcide, I believed where true. I was so afraid of thinking that way again, falling into that darkness again, that I knew I had to stop smoking. I never want to feel like that again, I never want to think like that again. So now I know I need to and I want to, that makes a big difference.
After 4 days I already feel a difference. I'm more happy and I already put some things in order I had to do for a long time. 

The hardest part is not to see myself as a stoner anymore. As long as I see myself as a stoner, I will think like a stoner. Like ""I need it to sleep"" or ""I need it to calm down"" or ""oh the sun shines, best thing to to is smoke one in the garden"". No. I have to think like a non pothead. ""if I can't sleep, that's ok. I will do something in the meantime until I feel sleepy and go to bed"". Or ""I want to calm down, so I go for a run"".

I was browsing Reddit this morning and come across a post from this sub Reddit, this Reddit was a massive part of my life why trying to quit so its only fair i give back with my story/update.

Its now been about 9/10 months since i quit (Generally forgot how long) dam it seems so hard when i was trying to quit. Telling myself it was the last bag 1000's of times. Countless days trying to give up only to ringing my dealer at 9pm and submit to the cravings.

Now, and honesty i mean this it seems such a blur and what in the 2/3weeks of going though the pain of giving up now it just seems like it was such a small and easy thing to do.

I am really over it, of course the thought of a smoke and a gaming night with my mates does sound fun but i wont risk it after 15 years of smoking i wont ruin it, and its literally just a thought the same as thinking how cool it would be to go on holiday or to a concert, like it doesn't consume my whole life.

I will never smoke again, and im so happy with the money saved and my better state of mind. All the ""FUN"" things i used to do while stoned, well guess what i still do them and still have fun.

The only regret was not giving up sooner.

I really hope this helps someone and sorry for bad English I am a math and IT guy :-)

My use is spiraling out of control, yesterday I checked the DSM criteria for cannabis dependence, abuse and use disorder, and I meet all of ithem. Especially this:

9. Cannabis use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by cannabis.

10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:

a.   A need for markedly increased amounts of cannabis to achieve intoxication or desired effect.

b.   A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of cannabis.

I've reached such a tolerance that I don't even get high from it anymore, yet I keep vaping compulsively. I'm severely depressed and on a ton of psych-meds, so I definetely need to quit. 

I'm hitting the rock bottom with this, I'm disgusted with myself.

I have a small stash left and cannot get any after I run out bc corona. I could either throw it away or finish it - and I've already decided I'll finish it. Then I'm totally out and won't have any other choice than to quit. 

I'm scared. For the first time in 2+ years I won't have any, so I'll be forced to quit. This will be in a few days.

We were just catching up after a few weeks of not talking and going over our relationship. She was telling me that she had always wanted to smoke with me through the duration of our relationship and that she never offered it to me because she thought it would be disrespectful (which was news to me, I never knew that she felt so strongly about me smoking with her). It wasn't really about her wanting me to fail, but rather that she thought it was fun and she wanted to do it with the person that she loved (which makes sense to me, but still, I never did).

After awhile of talking she said that she was even thinking about offering me to smoke a joint with her earlier in the car ride (that was still in progress). Again, I was really shocked, but kinda excited. I don't really get the opportunity to use my refusal skills. And that's exactly what I did. I refused just out of pure reflex and habit. I'm proud of that, but the story goes on.

We went to a different location and she said that she was going to smoke, which she did (outside the car). We both sat on the hood of her car while she was downwind and smoked a bowl. She then offered it to me and it was was difficult. This time has been the hardest that it has been for me in years. I wasn't close to relapse, per se, but it was definitely the first time that I had to use my refusal skills and work my therapy in order to keep my goals. 

I guess what I am trying to say is that I know why it was so hard because I have been working with my therapist on it for so long. I feel so left out that I am the one that needs to abstain. Why am I the only one who thinks that weed is bad? Why am I the only one that gets left at home alone when everyone else goes to smoke? Why does MY OWN GIRLFRIEND (at the time) go out with MY friends to smoke while im just at home? Why do I still have to keep this up?

So basically I've been a very heavy smoker for 12 years or so (0z a week at least) I've browsed this forum two years ago when I originally quit for two months. It was very helpful knowing I wasn't alone. So basically I'm on day 2 coming up day three now as it's 3:45 am and I just can't shut my eyes yet again..

About two years ago I was told by my father who I work with that it was time to stop. He gave me all the help I wanted be it medical financial etc he was very good and I thank him for this. But he can be very controlling. I believe because of this and it wasn't my own decision it didn't go so well. I was using diazepam to sleep which is way worse than weed and highly addictive also made me feel like a drunkard. I suffered from and extreme gambling addiction which financially crippled me for years and good old Mary Jane made everything feel ok when I lost everything. Which is terrible (even writing this is upsetting me ) but yeah I had the double whammy smoke a big joint and loose my wage packet before my bills were to come out to some horrible slot machine which would pay me back pence after putting through thousands. I have kurbed the gambling now but the weed has got to go again... 

The last time I gave up I was two months into and not feeling better (sleep and eating wise) 

I'm on day two now and hungry but can't eat.. knackered but can't sleep. How can food be so appealing until it reaches my mouth then incomes the stomach pain I guess from anxiety. Tbh its been nearly three days now and I've eaten half a tuna sandwich and 4 chicken dippers and I'm not a small fella so my body's extremely confused and exhausted. I just taken up running in the past week (just before I quit) I've been doing about 2/3 miles with some excerises in breaks. I just want some advice on how I can eat again as I don't feel I have the energy to run if my body hasn't received any food. My stomach craves all this food but my brain won't let me chow it down. 

Thanks for reading this as it's probably the first time ive ever posted on any forum ever. 

I hope this time is the time as I want a clear head and to succeed in life not throw it away like I was 

Many thanks

I crave to get Xanax and mix it with alcohol this weekend. I was a heavy abuser of pills and alcohol and I‚Äôd get stoned while doing so.. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

I really don‚Äôt.

And if I‚Äôm not sober I‚Äôll ruin everything. My job, relationship, me... 

Why am I like this? Why can‚Äôt I just grow the fuck up... 

And it got worse also because I watched the lil peep documentary on crave last night and that environment just looked so fun and addicting... to just do drugs all the time, make music, and not have a care in the world about anything.. but I‚Äôve already lived that life.. so why can‚Äôt I grow up... 

I have such a good career and I could throw it away.. I almost did before I quit.

Positives:
My motivation is higher then it‚Äôs been in over a year, I‚Äôm actually enjoying school again 

I‚Äôve noticed my vocabulary in my essays has gotten a lot better, I am currently writing my final and I‚Äôm feeling really good about it. 

When I would smoke then read something I could only remember it the day of, but now I am able to recall the documents I‚Äôve read. This has helped sooooo much in finding information I need lol

I have more energy then I did when I was smoking 

I‚Äôve started to lose weight and am back on a exercise routine 

My overall mood has improved 

For the first time in a year I was able to think of a future I wanted for myself and it genuinely got me excited

Negatives:

I still can‚Äôt get more then a consecutive hour of sleep

I‚Äôve noticed when playing games I‚Äôve been more irritable  

My dreams are extremely vivid and most of the time somewhat scary

So I quit on 5/14/20 after some drama and the need to be clean for a job opportunity.  The drama is better and I got the job.  Still in the training process of it, but I am liking it more and more each day.  But I want this to be more about my cognitive and physiological changes rather than life changes, as I am more enthusiastic about the former.  

So as far as cognitive benefits go, I am pretty fucking happy.  I am sharp and quick-witted, sometimes to a fault even.  I always enjoyed comedic shit-talking, even stoned, but I am currently finding I am even better and more fluid at it without the influence of pot.  That might sound like a small thing, and potentially a douch√©y one, but I think humor is one of the greatest gifts we have as humans, and I am finally at a point where I feel like I am having as much fun with it as I used to stoned.  

I am more professional.  I remember things more.  My responsibilities are always in my mind.  I am able to take care of things better sober.  And that gives me more peace.  Sure, things can still go wrong at any time, that is the nature of life.  But I no longer need to go run and hide into pot to escape the anxiety of that.  I am tanking it and am more mentally strong.

I love the way I think and I am passionate about accomplishing things.  I could go on about that, but for the sake of anonymity, let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm doing better in this area than in a long fucking time.  

Showers, music, and food are awesome.  These are all things I used to do stoned but are now back to being fun as shit sober.   I start showers hot, and end them all the way cold.  It‚Äôs exhilarating and actually feels like it washes my cares away after a long day of work.  There were a few restaurants I had been wanting to try the past few months but never got around to it because I was too stoned to put forth the effort.  I‚Äôve gone to all but one of them now and the experience of it was super fulfilling.  I‚Äôve been going through my old music collection both physical and digital and have been appreciating songs and albums I haven‚Äôt in years.  It‚Äôs exciting and feels like a treasure hunt.

Anyway, that‚Äôs all I feel like writing right now, if anybody cares to ask about any specifics I‚Äôll do my best to answer.  There are a few aspects of things surrounding my situation with this I‚Äôd rather not talk about.  But I am happy to talk about most things.  I realize this post is somewhat vague and that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want specifics to give away my identity and I don‚Äôt care for it to be novel length.  As I said, feel free to ask me about the specifics you care about and I will answer what I can.

One final note: I‚Äôm not really missing weed right now.  Other times I quit I missed it quite terribly.  Not sure why for sure that is. I‚Äôm more of a positive agnostic than anything, but I‚Äôm willing to call it divine grace and appreciate it as that.  This time I‚Äôm going strong in myself, and I‚Äôd be fucking pissed at myself for backsliding.  I even kind of resent the act a little bit.  Maybe because I feel like I allowed it to take so many things from me in the past 7 or so years I‚Äôve been partaking it.  I like and respect myself a hell of a lot more without it.  Looking forward, I see no scenario where I will allow myself to use until my goals are accomplished.  I have my goals set up in such a way that it will take me many years to complete them.  Anything can happen, but I‚Äôd rather die than be stoner me again.  Some might say that that‚Äôs excessive, but it works for me.  I believe everyone should carve out their own means of doing it if they feel called to quit for good such as myself.

To anyone on the path of permanent quitting, I wish you well.  Life will never be a perfect road.  But it is an adventure that, to me, is worth it all the while.  The good times would mean nothing without the bad times.  Grace and blessings to all of you, 

You have my love.

I do what I can to stay optimistic and hopeful, but what I've learned is that action is the only way forward, as a thinker and dreamer, this is an incredibly hard pill for me to swallow, I've always been hasty in my decisions and jumping from one place to the next, seeking the next adventure, but now, I truly crave stability so that I can really begin developing myself, perhaps for the first time in my adult life.

I even got up early and NAILED a test at 8 am today. I was up at 6 45 even though I slept at 2 am, and Im way less tired than I was a few days ago. I think something that really helps me this time around is that basically every time I was smoking before I quit, Id constantly think to myself how not fun it was. And when I was sober and trying to skip a day of smoking, Id always end up smoking. While I grinded the bud, all I thought about was me not wanting to do this, me telling myself it wasnt too late to put it down. But it was like my mind and my body didnt agree, so my body did what it wanted as my mind was a captive.




That feeling was awful. I think because I spent about 2 weeks like that, its really turned me off to smoking which has resulted in way less cravings than when I usually try to quit. I have always seen posts where people say they KNOW this is the time its gonna stick, and honestly? I think this is the one for me. I dont even miss it. It kinda reminds me of when I quit alcohol. Now when I even consider drinking, all I can see is memories of me puking and the craving is gone. Same deal with weed. I dont feel like puking, but I do feel.... repulsed? I think thats a good word to describe it. Just the thought repels me away. It feels good, in a weird way.

I also have been researching and wrapping my head around a career choice that I can get excited about!

Hell yeah.,"This post is dedicated to all the lurkers, like I was for a long time, especially those of you that enjoy vape pens. I wrote this when I was one week in, and in a much better mood than right now, but nonetheless I still wanted to share.

I want to tell my story because all of your stories have helped me immensely over this past week and other times I've tried to quit. I want to give that back to someone else, even if it's just one person.

This is a bit TL;DR so in this post I'll explain a little background, the turning point, what to expect, and what has been helpful for me.

&#x200B;

Now let me take you on a journey...

For context, long-time casual smoker (in my 30's), used a combo of flower and vapes the last few years, and vape carts almost daily the last 3 months.

I've spent countless hours searching Reddit and other forums trying to understand how vape pens affect people. I'm so grateful to those of you who have shared their stories, especially the embarrassing crap I personally NEVER thought I'd do (but did) like:

\-- Attempting to heat up the last of the oil with anything hot to get your money's worth but getting pissed because it's not hitting.

\-- All the hours of planning on how to get more, especially while in a new city.

\-- Shamefully hiding it from your partner and smoking to make our relationship ""better,"" because ""when I have weed, we fight less.""

\-- And my personal favorite ""I feel like a shithead moment;"" digging an old cartridge out of the garbage. That one really stings.

&#x200B;

PAST ATTEMPTS

I made a post on here previously during one of my 3 day ""tries."" I had listened to a book about empaths and felt like I could relate whole-heartedly. Now I feel like some of this ""sensitivity"" I've developed over the years could be likely due to stifled personality growth and the inability to deal with life in a mature way. I'm not trying to be hard on myself, but instead facing the reality that this is what happens when you cope in unhealthy ways.

After I made that post, the support and comments I received were beautiful but I felt completely overwhelmed by it. Guess who was there to calm me down? Good ol' trusty vape pen. My sleep-deprived brain excused it as a reward for making it 3 days, which is pretty twisted. I avoided quitting for another month.

I told myself I was using it to ""help"" with my anxiety, along with the excuse that ""there's a global pandemic and chaos on the streets, a little bit of weed is perfectly fine."" Even reading a sentence just like this one in other posts, I'd say to myself that my situation was different. 

&#x200B;

THE TURN AROUND

It took me a long time to realize there was a problem, not just with wanting to smoke all the time but the way my thoughts were starting to develop. My thinking became very circular and I'd ruminate a lot on very negative thoughts. I'd hang on certain words people said and obsess with what they could mean. I always thought analyzing your thinking was a positive thing but I realized too much of this can be a slippery slope. When I started to believe most of the negative thoughts, I knew I needed professional help.

Two months ago I began teletherapy because of this pattern of thinking, which I had previously attributed to anxiety. Listening to yourself talk open and honestly with an unbiased person can be mind-blowing. I talked a lot about wanting to stop smoking, we'd make plans on usage and I thought the accountability would really help. It didn't... every appointment I was delivering bad news and excuses.

This led to the realization that not much else was going to make me stop unless I buckle down and commit. That decision alone was one of the toughest.

Anyways, enough about when I couldn't stop if I wanted to, because I believe that's over now.

&#x200B;

WHAT TO EXPECT

This is different for everyone, but here's how I've felt the past 10 days:

First couple days were interesting, very scattered thinking. My brain was constantly trying to find meaning in everything that was happening. I was trying to constantly look for connections that weren't there. I could hear myself speak some pretty weird thoughts out loud but tried to be patient with myself.

The third day, I felt pretty good. The fog was clearing up and felt hopeful.

The fourth day is when the panic attacks began. I had never had a proper one that put me on my ass like this past week. Bad feelings the entire day. Breathing exercises and cold showers didn't make the feelings go away completely but helped subside them a lot.

Every day after that initial panic attack I felt like I improved. I still had smaller panic attacks but I was able to bounce back quicker.

One week,  I'm not quite feeling myself but I'm also not anxious. Maybe a little subdued, but most importantly I feel proud. That's all that matters.

Today, feel like absolute shit. Crying spells and panic attacks. I had an encounter with a stranger that some would call ""traumatic"" a couple days ago so I'm not quite sure what to contribute this anxiety to. I'm sure it's a healthy mixture of all of the above. The day of the incident and after I was completely fine, but today's been different.

With that said, I'm so glad I didn't smoke to get through it. I already know how this would have played out, I would have smoked until I wasn't sad and pushed everything down further. Luckily, my partner has been there for me and I'm able to talk some (not all, most I can't explain or feel like a nutcase) of these feelings out.

&#x200B;

THINGS THAT WERE HELPFUL (FOR ME)

Telling someone. Tell someone on this subreddit, a close friend, a therapist, whoever. Support is so extremely helpful. If you don't have anyone, message me and I'll be your support. My therapist suggest I look into NA, MA, and CDA.

Melatonin was a lifesaver the first couple nights for sleep.

Aromatherapy and essential oils take my mind off the repetitive thoughts.

New hobbies. Walks outside. Meditation.

Baths help some people. For me, it raised my body temperature and made me more anxious.

WIM HOF!!!!! Fantastic breathing exercise. He has an app with guided breathing and you can also find videos on YouTube. Cold showers while doing this breathing are life-giving.

&#x200B;

FINAL THOUGHTS

The most positive part of this experience has been getting to know myself again. Being in tune with my body and observing the feelings instead of suppressing them. It hasn't been easy but I'm looking forward to learning more and getting better at it. Hold on for dear life to a growth mindset and be your biggest cheerleader. 

These feelings are extremely shitty but if you can somehow think to yourself (between all the negativity) that each time you're able to get past a panic attack or negative feeling, that's a win towards a healthy brain. I'm ready for my brain to be healthy again.

10 days down, many more to go. Thanks to this sub for everything.

Everything feels harder, more boring, more existentially terrifying without that high to look forward to. I've been self-medicating (along with actual anti-depressants) for years and sometimes I almost manage to convince myself its okay to keep going this way, this is the way that I am and weed is the only thing that really helps. Even my friends and family seem to think it's the most effective thing for dealing with my bouts of anxiety/depression. But I've always hated being this dependent, my tolerance is through the roof and I have struggled with even taking T breaks. I've tried to quit to save money, quit to lose weight, quit to have my brain back. This sub has helped convince me that to make any sustainable strides in my mental health, I have to finally drop the crutch. I think it's making everything worse and has wrecked my rewards system/ability to motivate and take care of myself. I'm just not sure how much of this is my depression and how much of it is my addiction and I need to find out. I want to stop making excuses for myself and letting the people I love make excuses for me too.

I feel so pathetic for finding quitting so hard, when I have weed around it's literally all I can think about. I tried to look for what my ""cues"" are and it's basically once I notice I'm not high, I want to get high. I like the act of packing and smoking a bowl and I like the feeling of being high, it doesn't feel as simple as just trying to break a habit but I'd be happy to be proven wrong. I've gotten conflicting opinions on if I should keep a stash on hand (to build will-power/continually make the choice not to smoke) or if I should clear out everything to make it easier. I think it would be easier if I didn't have anything around but I've heard that's not as effective in the long-term.

Does anyone have any opinions on this? I've tried both ways and always find it harder when I have weed around. But neither method has worked, clearly, so idk.

I'm at a loss and this sub has been keeping me afloat lately, just in finding a community of people struggling with the same thing. I'm grateful to everyone that has shared/continues to share their experiences",1,0

I read this very simple comment today on Youtube and believe it or not, I felt so much better and freer after reading it. 

Perhaps my single biggest struggle with quitting marijuana is the fact that we are socialized and coerced into believing that marijuana addiction isn't a real. We hear it so much that we start to believe it ourselves, and then when addicts like us start to believe this notion, we start to disbelieve our intuition which tells us we have a problem with marijuana. 

We see successful artists who use it, directors, actors, businesspeople, yogis, Sadhus, revolutionaries, poets. We see all of these people who use it and we feel bad that we can't use it in a positive way like they do, or did. And we shit on ourselves for not being able to.

But the fact of the matter is, the undeniable truth, the blaring siren, and the white-hot spark of candidness is this:

 **weed addiction is real and it ruins lives**

so, let us believe ourselves, let us be free, let us fix our lives and repair damages, let us be better than ever before, let us grow, let us evolve, and let us live our truth.

I was 120 days sober. Yesterday I was celebrating a major professional milestone I never would have hit without quitting weed.  I was drinking with my housemates and having a nice time, I was maybe 6/10 drunk. We ran out of alcohol pretty early and I was starting to lose my buzz. My housemates decided to smoke instead and I was in this stupid mindset where all that mattered was staying intoxicated. I messed up. 

I took two huge bong rips, then greened out for four fucking hours. I threw up absolutely everything in my stomach within the first hour. Vomit was coming out of my nose and tear ducts and burning every step of the way. I violently dry heaved for the next three hours. Eventually the wretching gave me a nose bleed and I was spitting blood up too. 

I was so sick I couldn't stand up. I ended up lying on the lawn for the rest of the night. Whenever my housemates tried to move me, I started dry heaving and panicking because I was so dizzy and scared. I couldn't move my body, all I could do was feel myself convulsing and hear myself crying. 

Now my face and neck are speckled in hundreds of burst blood vessels. My body is completely covered in mosquito bites from lying outside for so long. My throat is so swollen it feels like I'm breathing through a straw. When I eat and drink, it feels like my organs are bruised.

The euphoria of stopping has stopped (ah), and for the last couple of days I've been feeling extremely anxious, depressed, unable to do anything, among other physical symptoms that let me exhausted. I went to the doctor today who announced that TADAH.... Withdrawal symptoms!
On one hand I am relieved that I am not slipping into my old anxious / depressed background, but man! I'm feeling so nauseous, with headaches and sweating, also having very vivid dreams. Surprisingly I am really determined to stay away from that shit, but the nausea and its fellows are quite overwhelming lol. Apparently its supposed to last for about 15d / one month.

I just messed up my day 1 after only an hour of waking up, but coming back here and checking this sub reminds me there is still hope. I will get there, things are just hard...","I have been lurking this sub for a long time on and off over the years. Weed has been steady in my life since I was 15 and I am now 26. I have been a daily smoker for at least the past few years now, time is so blurred together it is hard to keep track. In the past year I made the realization marijuana is holding me back but every time I try to quit I end up reverting back to it. 

The past few months have been hell for me for a lot of reasons, but the past couple of weeks I went off of my antidepressants cold-turkey and have been in severe physical and mental withdrawal. I used weed to help cope as usual and it honestly made me feel worse - more nauseous, more angry. And I decided once I got my meds back again (which I did last night) That I would stop smoking weed for good, or at least for a while. I decided I need to stop neglecting my medication and mental health for a life of getting high to numb the pain, even though it has comforted me so much it has taken over my life and kept me stuck for too long. So this morning, back on my meds and motivated and finally not feeling sick to my stomach, I decided I was going to start today. 

It's only 920 and I already fucked that up. I just was so bored and laying here not motivated and just could not stop thinking about how if I just take a hit it would help even it out. So I packed a bowl and did just that, because for some reason my self control is that of a 5 year old. Trying not to hate on myself right now, so I went back to this sub to read everyone's words of wisdom instead. 

Reading all the posts on the front page of leaves instead of dwelling in my fuck up is making me feel better. I am still disappointed that I did this, but I know it is not a linear battle and I have given up vices before - weed just time and time again has proven to be the hardest one for me to let go of. I tend to give up and beat myself up when I make mistakes like this and then throw the whole thing away altogether, but no. I am not going to let this one hit ruin what could be a good rest of day 1. I am determined and I have seen how strong all of you are and how far all of you have come - if all of these people can do it, who says I can't too? The support and positive vibes around here is incredible. I want to be free of this addiction so I can feel that too. 

Sorry for the rant, but I guess what I am trying to say thanks all of you for reminding me that I got this and allowing me to not let one impulsive bong hit turn into a full day of binge smoking. Now I am putting the bong away and going to do a barre workout so I can get some natural endorphins and restart my day off right :) Hope you all have a fantastic day!",419,0

Last couple of days have been rough. I have been feeling dizzy, weak, horrendous acne (I am 38 years old!). Mood has been at times depressive with suicidal thoughts, but I'm still here!

Life feels stressful, and I haven't been coping all that well. I have had lots of small victories, though. I cleaned the house, even mopped the floor. I disenfected surfaces. I am proud of some outputs for work.

My mind has been a mess. Depressive, anxious, racing thoughts. I take medication that helps me sleep.

I had been smoking high potency THC strains daily for a few months in the latest binge. Self medication for mental health? I was addicted to the shit! I had a massive panic attack, it felt like my mind had split into three parts. I wasn't even high, I think it was cumulative cannabis in my body over months. I had to take two weeks off work, didn't know if I would ever ""come down"".

Second worst experience of my life. I don't want to think about the worst.

What I have noticed is that I can feel terrible and fantastic all in the same day. The moods swings are tiring, but you know what? It feels like I'm actually living and experiencing life! Take away the narcotics and I can experience and learn properly again. Hopefully, I can learn and master the art of recovery.

I quit smoking cannabis exactly 33 days ago after about 7 years of daily smoking. It's not my first attempt to quit but it is the first time I've managed to take it this far. Now I did actually feel better for the first weeks, I had less brain fog, was sleeping better, and I felt like visiting friends more often. 

Last week however, I've started to feel somewhat depressed. Not like super depressed but just less happy, with a big lack of motivation (even for my hobbies), and some (emotional) thoughts about what I am doing with my life. The positive effects that I described earlier are still there but whereas I had hoped that everything would improve even more and by now I would start to really feel better, the opposite appears to be the case.   


 I am not going back to weed, that is not what I am afraid of and it just isn't an option for me. I'm just wondering whether I'll keep feeling like this for a long time or whether this is just a bad week (which  I of course had as well when I was still smoking).

Firstly, not looking for/expecting medical advice but general support or similar stories/successful recovery

About 20 days ago (feels like a year) I had what I call a psychotic episode. I had been vaping pure THC cartridges pretty much all waking hours. Long time smoker but the cartridges became my go to for convenience toward the end there. Also drinking 2 - 3 Monsters a day and poor diet.

I went manic for 4 days and eventually went to ER and missed a week of work. Basically I was told to see my psych asap which I did and she prescribed anti-psychotics. I was on very low dose for 2 weeks which did help with psychosis but I had severe side effects i.e. hyperglycemia, abnormal tongue movement, irregular heartbeat. 

Last meeting I explained I cannot keep taking this med, I really feel it is almost worse than just dealing with the symptoms despite the benefits, so I've been off a little over 24 hours. I am having insomnia right now which is normal enough given the circumstances, and subtle voices but not as bad as initially. It almost feels like I'm ""creating"" them when I think about it too much which I think is a good sign overall. It's not blatant out of control.

It's been less than 30 days overall so I know I'm still detoxing from THC, also from quitting caffeine and nicotine cold turkey at the same time.

I'm faithful, so forgive the language, but I pray this will pass without the need for antipsychotics which also seem poisonous. My mood is stable, I feel I can work just fine. I hope all these toxic chemicals leaving my body will allow my brain to make a full recovery. I really just want to work, workout, eat and sleep and spend time with my dog.

My gym just opened and I've been there as much as possible. I've changed my diet to include no added sugars and minimally processed/whole foods. My life is different and I take not one second for granted.

I smoked monday and it was great but I needed a lot of sleep tuesday morning and was really sleepy the whole day. Didn't smoke tuesday because I wanted to show myself I can regulate. Yesterday smoked again and I felt horrible. The first joint I thought why am I doing this but the voice in my head saying it doesn't matter was stronger. Today when I woke up I couldn't breath and had severe headaches. I feel horrible about myself, about my body and what have come from me. So I'm going to quit for good now.

Smoking weed triggers an effect in the brain, dopamine, the reward center; causing you to feel happy when you smoke. However this happiness is a complete illusion, weed fools your brain. Weed happiness is a fake and hazy happiness. Weed happiness is ignoring all responsibilities and problems, and living in a numb world.

Real events, tastes, scents, sounds, sights, however, can also trigger this dopamine/reward center effect. This is when real happiness happens.

But anyway, at school i was a REALLY light smoker. I only smoked every now and then before a function with the homies. I never really felt the need to constantly smoke or get high before coronavirus took over.

At the start of this year I was off it after smoking a few times during the christmas season. But when the outbreak hit and everyone began quarantining I went back harder than before. Suddenly all my uni courses were online only, the gyms were all closed and my friends were too scared to hang out anymore. It was depressing and I wanted a way to feel better. I never had to leave the house and I took advantage of that by smoking throughout the whole day. Before I would buy eights and try to ration them out, packing small bowls and waiting until the evening to smoke. But now that I didn't have to go out I could just spend the whole day high. I was buying ounce bags and going through them way too quickly.

&#x200B;

Last friday, I finished off the ounce I had. My tolerance had gotten so high that I didn't even feel anything until I had smoked 3 bowls, and the feeling barely lasted. I had developed a cough from all the inhalation and was spitting up phlegm like an old man. I finally got fed up with it and resolved not to buy more. Like the fiend I am, the next day I immediately bought more, just an edible and some joints this time, in the hopes that I could finish it the same night and be free of it by sunday. 

Since then, things have been difficult. Right away the withdrawals came, more noticeable than I've felt before. My appetite is almost totally gone; even if I feel hungry, after a few bites I lose interest. Somehow it feels better to not eat and let the hunger nag me than put something in my mouth. I can barely sleep at night, to the point that in the early hours of monday morning I scraped together as much loose bud and residue as I could to smoke myself to sleep. That was the absolute last of the weed I own, and I know that if there was more somewhere here I couldn't stop myself. The only reason I haven't relapsed again is because my supply is empty. I feel edgy and restless throughout the day; sometimes I feel so angry I could throttle someone, other times I'm crying for no reason. 

Unfortunately my decision came right when being in a good mental space is pretty important. Tomorrow I have a final exam, and a group presentation recommending real estate investments. The rest of my exams and projects are coming due next week. I feel weak and stupid. I can't focus on what I need to do or communicate my opinions properly with my classmates. My confidence is gone; when I try to practice my part of the presentation I stutter and stumble over my words like an idiot. I know that tonight I'll be stuck in bed again, getting no sleep, dreading the next day. I also know that it's not normal; I'm a good student and when I put myself to it I can do well. But I don't feel like myself.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if this come across as directionless. I just felt the need to vent. I keep telling myself that it will be over soon and I can relax and set up all the checks I need to make sure I stay quit. But even as I type I'm thinking of buying more, just to get me out of this for a few hours. I know it's a bad idea but I don't know how else to escape this. In a few minutes my classmates are going to meet online to rehearse the presentation, and I'm going to have to sit there in this fog trying to pretend like I know what I'm talking about, like I'm not a phoney, like I haven't been staring at our report all afternoon, totally incapable of providing any good input. I should have quit when things were easy and I could really focus on being okay. But I didn't and now I don't know what to do.",3,0

As the self-isolation regime started to lift up in Moscow, Russia, I began to hang out with the few of my friends. Today I was out with an ex-coworker who I consider to be rather wise. I told her I quit weed about 50 days ago and asked her whether she sees any difference in me compared to when I was smoking.

She told me that yes, she does see a noticeable difference. She said that I'm a lot more joyful, relaxed, outgoing, that I don't seem to need to take time to find the right words for what I want so say. This is exactly how I feel, but it meant so much to hear this from a friend of mine.

Before I headed to the metro to go to the place where we met, I went to grab an espresso to a coffee shop right next to my house. A pretty girl was in charge of the place today, and while I was drinking my coffee and after I offered her a cigarette we chatted. When I was smoking weed, I was far too reserved to have a meaningful conversation with a stranger on the go. But we both seemed to enjoy each other's company and exchanged our names before I had to go. I'll meet her again.

This is all great, but there is one more thing that changed after I quit that is far more objective than the others I mentioned. I'm able to laugh again. It seems like in the past I was ashamed of my laughter. I don't yet understand this whole thing to the full extent, but as one my friend said, previously, instead of laughter, I had a strange reaction to things I found funny. But now I'm able to laugh wholeheartedly, and this brings me great joy.

I also experience waves of warmth in my chest when I'm in a great mood, and this feeling is as brand new and exciting as it was on day 7.

But, I am in college and every single one of my 4 roommates, along with the friends they invite over, smoke everyday. Hell, I even dated this girl for awhile and she would carry her dab cart on her at all times (Y'all know how it goes).

Even though I like most of my roommates (one is actually my best friend) and even though I loved this girl that I was dating, I could not help but get irrationally angry every time weed was brought up, talked about, smoked, vaped, etc, in front of me. It's not because I feel like they don't respect my boundaries, which they do (don't smoke in my room, please), but I have no idea what is going on inside my head and I don't like feeling this every way EVERY SINGLE TIME.

But this time...my heavy use made me SO detatched from reality that I literally did not know if I was dreaming or not. It was derealisation at its most severe and it couldn't go on.   


Everything isn't hunky dory. I've had days where I've been depressed, lonely, etc, but I've been clear headed enough to either try and do something about it or to give myself a break or a pep talk. Mostly, I'm really bored - especially as my housemates and friends are out of the city. But that's just what it is. Hopefully now I am sober enough to learn lessons and coping mechanisms.  


Lastly - this time really does feel different. Not just because of the measures I took (see previous post), but also my attitude is completely different. It isn't 12 days since I quit, its 12 days since I started trying to take my life back.

Looking forward to be able to see the sky, hear the birds, or appreciate the nature without needing anything else than my own breath and still pumping heart.

Feeling very proud that I have managed to get this far having smoked daily for 15 years.

Benefits I am enjoying:

* Far less anxiety and increased self confidence/self worth
* Huge boost in motivation to improve my life in other ways like exercise, meditation, healthy eating (have lost about 12KG since quitting)
* Have managed to kicked other habits such as drinking every day (now just one day on weekends)
* Clarity of thought
* Better sleeping patterns (wasn‚Äôt the case in the first few weeks!)
* Improved relationships with loved ones and friends
* More money!
* Less guilt (would hate wasting the day so much when stoned)
* Far more patience with things

Most importantly I feel like I am finally accepting who I am as a person and learning to live in the present moment.¬†

Smoking weed/hash was always an escape for me and would let me block off any troubling emotions/thoughts which I did not want to confront.

It has also let me strip away an ego/persona I had built for myself which would aid me in covering up the cracks in my life, consequently stopping me being able to open up to loved ones about how I was feeling.

Well done to everyone else who is also on the journey with me and thank you to everyone who has shown support along the way :)

I also thought it would help me get in with the cooler kids at school and I was really into Seth Rogen movies back then so I thought there was nothing wrong with weed and that it actually made you a better person. 

Flash forward to today and I‚Äôm lucky and blessed enough that I have been able to get a good job after 3 years out of college. I went to a film school that only took 2 years for a bachelors degree. But my routine is basically go to work, work out and smoke pot. I don‚Äôt do anything else and it hurts my pride being so lazy. 


I‚Äôve had lots of ambition in life and opportunities but being stoned through out the last 5 years has made me give up easily on projects when they got hard and miss opportunities because of being the silly stoner dude. 

I‚Äôve tried quitting many times and even made it 30 days, then I hit a bowl cause I felt like I had earned it. I‚Äôve smoked almost every week since then and that was probably last year or something. 

Smoking has clearly affected my lungs, my skin and I can tell that my teeth have become dingy. 

The thing I hate the most is that I feel like I have no integrity when I say I‚Äôm gonna quit smoking pot and do it the next day. It literally makes me feel like a EFFing loser with no control over themselves. 

I knew a guy in college who could smoke an 8th a day and be very productive and I‚Äôm sort of jealous of that guy but I‚Äôm just more upset that I tell myself I‚Äôll quit and never do.

I‚Äôve always wanted that same high I had when I first started smoking and I‚Äôd smoke more and more in pursuit of it but I think many of you on here would know how futile that pursuit really is. You‚Äôll never be able get that high ever again, even with a very lengthy tolerance break. It‚Äôs impossible to recreate that high because it was likely many many years ago when your life was in a different phase and so many other things rather than the drug itself contributed to it being so great. I really think that my environment contributed to that high, that grand euphoria, just as much if not more than the THC itself entering my bloodstream. 

I didn‚Äôt have a wife or a full time job or a mortgage to pay back then. I was a carefree teenager fumbling his way through adolescence and high school who marvelled at the idea that smoking the dried up flowers of a plant could make me feel like I was the king of the world, like nothing could touch me, like I had unlocked an ancient secret that gave me insight into the complex nature of existence, like I was experiencing things that people who were too straight laced to try the stuff would never experience. 

Here I am now sitting at almost 4 weeks clean and sober and I‚Äôm beginning to realize that the high I was chasing was here all along. All I had to do was stop. The sky is bluer, the grass greener, the birds more interesting and worth stopping for a minute to watch for a while. Food tastes better, music sounds better. My marriage, which was favourable and stable while I was still smoking, is improving everyday. I‚Äôm remembering why I fell in love with my wife and I truly feel that love and that connection more and more with every day of sobriety that goes by. I‚Äôm beginning to feel that love and connection for myself again. I‚Äôm realizing how that love for myself has been missing for a very long time. 

I always thought that to smoke was to find peace, love and connection. I realize now that the more you smoke and the longer you smoke, the more that love, peace and connection fade out of your life as hate, chaos and isolation enter it and eventually consume it. 

Stay strong brothers and sisters. In making this journey together, we are finding the power of love, the serenity of peace, and the importance of connection once again in our lives.",5,0

Things that have helped. Exercise... a lot of it, it's somewhere to put my aggression into as well as ease the boredom. Wake up a little earlier so you're tired when it's time to go to bed. I try to stay up and watch a movie until I can't physically keep my eyes open. Throw away your paraphernalia. I found myself almost scraping out old pipes for resin in a moment of desperation. 

Whatever you do, just keep it up. We're in it together and it's all temporary.",5,0

Anyone else wanna join me on this journey?,"Day 1: So I‚Äôve been practically daily smoking for 6 years with a few months break here and there for travelling/moving to a new city (which is probably the best thing to do to quit weed cause the new city is a high in itself). 

Finished my last bag yday morning so it‚Äôs been around 36 hours since I last smoked. Used up the last of the dust in my grinder. This is the longest time sober in about 8 months now. Heard a really sad story about a celebrity that committed suicide and ended up crying in the shower for like half an hour lol. Although I know some of the tears were to take pity on myself for doing this to my body for so long. 

I haven‚Äôt told my (stoner) friends yet and not sure how to hang out with them when they smoke. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to take it. 

If you‚Äôre also quitting we can share updates on how we‚Äôre dealing with it. It‚Äôd be nice to have someone to check in with to see how we‚Äôre getting on. Lemme know in the comments! Peace.

Day 2: I‚Äôm so happy with the support that this thread has attracted from people embarking on the same journey as me. It‚Äôs been a long journey to get this point from smoking my first J in 2012. 

Updates:
1) night sweats have been horrible so far and is the most obvious physical manifestation of withdrawal. Makes you really realise that your body is craving something it‚Äôs not getting

2) Mood- it hasn‚Äôt gotten worse or better really. I think I‚Äôm just miserable from sitting on my ass unemployed for 9 months now. Still love food though. Having a 3 egg omelette You  while typing this up with an iced Irish coffee (no alcohol obvs) 

3) headaches- very slight so far. I think it‚Äôs because weight training is so mentally exhausting that my brain doesn‚Äôt have the energy to pulse and throb in pain. 

4) concentration- much better already. I can focus on boring conversations now whereas before I‚Äôd just hear one word and totally lose interest if it didn‚Äôt seem vaguely interesting to me. 

5) Energy levels have increased. Feeling quite energetic but it is up and down. Sometimes I just want to lie down and close my eyes. 

6) feeling much better about my recent break up. Initially I was agonising over the decision but I know it‚Äôs best for me. I don‚Äôt know what feelings I had before because I felt everything was clouded due to my excessive smoking. I need to get a clear head before I start getting seriously involved with women again because it‚Äôs not fair to make promises to people when I can‚Äôt even keep my promise to not smoke anymore.",32,0

Sure, weed exacerbated those effects, but I had kind of expected to be magically able to focus and get things done once I got sober. Surprise: it's not that easy!

I currently weigh just under 16 stone (224 pounds - the heaviest I have been in my life), I smoke (cigarettes also), I drink, and my diet... my diet is great when I‚Äôm sober. It‚Äôs not bad when I‚Äôm high. The volume of food I consume when I‚Äôve smoked however is astronomically more than when not. 

I got out of breath walking up 12 stairs the other day. Seriously out of breath. This can‚Äôt go on. 

Today has been hard. Time seems to have slowed down just to mess with me - to prolong things. I‚Äôm usually dropping off to sleep with heavy eyes right about now. I‚Äôm wide awake. And all of what I read or watch to help motivate me to quit... isn‚Äôt helping. 

I always saw myself as ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù. I got my degree, I work, and do well at my job. Smoking, I feel, has never affected that part of my life. 

People tell me that I‚Äôll be more sociable when not under the thumb of Mary Jane... I enjoy my own company. I don‚Äôt have many friends, but I never have. Smoking hasn‚Äôt changed that fact - in fact, when I do see my select friends, when I‚Äôve not smoked just before seeing them, they tell me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúquiet‚Äù or ‚Äúlook distracted‚Äù. The truth is that I really do enjoy my own company. I can happily sit alone for days, and smoking was my way of making social occasions bearable. 

Or so I thought. Maybe I enjoyed my own company so much because of the weed. Because I‚Äôm alone right now, and frankly, I‚Äôm bored. B. O. R. E. D. I have loads I could be doing; TV, games, books, music. But I just can‚Äôt be bothered because none of them are as good as when I‚Äôve had a smoke. 
It actually feels like the colour has gone from the world. 

I know I need to do this. I know I need to get healthy. Just right now, the voice in my head is trying its hardest to win. And I will not let it.

First of I want to start by saying this sub has already been a great help, it‚Äôs really comforting to see I‚Äôm not alone in coming to terms with the effect weed has had on our lives and you should all be proud of how well you‚Äôre doing.

I‚Äôm on a mere night 4 and have really struggled today, one thing that is really bugging me is the limbo between this new found energy and a lack of motivation. I know I should be getting out and doing some exercise or engaging my brain a bit more but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been left with this lingering weed demon who won‚Äôt allow me to do what needs to be done.

I‚Äôm curious if others had similar issues and how they managed to combat that, do I just weather the storm for now or am I risking that demon winning? This is all so weird man, 16 years of heavy smoking and it feels like I‚Äôve emptied myself a bit....in both good and bad ways.",3,0

I spent more than 5h browsing this forum with people having the same difficulty as I had when I stopped smoking weed. I stopped because of a panic attack when I was high. 

The first 6 months were the most difficult of my entire life. The first 3 the most horrendous. But, everything was a downhill after that.

I experienced extreme anxiety, panics, fear, weight gain and thousands of unpleasantnesses. I went to psychotherapy because of my anxiety. I started working out because of my weight gain. I started getting out of my comfort zone because of my fear and I started to enjoy life rather than smoking weed every night.

I do not regret it. It made me better. I didn't know who I was, what my limits were and what I was capable to do before I stopped smoking. I was always picked by others as ""the lazy one"". Turns out I'm not a lazy guy. Turns out I can get the job done and I can wake up early. After I stopped, my life was back on track. I sleep now better. I eat better. My emotions are under control. I remember things.

To whomever this is relatable, please try to stop and please understand that every emotion you feel, is temporary. Please go through my Reddit profile and check what I have posted and commented. You can notice my anxiety in the comments I've left and threads I have created. 

Life is worth living with your eyes open and mind cleared. Weed does not help. Weed does not define you.

Love you all.

What I have noticed and what to expect.","To start, I know this is long, but this will be very beneficial to anyone who finishes it, I can assure that. Title just about sums it up. Today (June 15th) makes 1 month exactly since the last time I got high (May 15th) 
I figured I could write about the positives of it for anyone still in the earlier days of their journey and experiencing withdrawal symptoms, which we all know are very real. Now I gotta say, at first it wasn‚Äôt all that easy. I documented my first couple of days without weed by posting in this reddit community, feel free to check them out if u want. I have one from day 4 titled ‚Äúirritability‚Äù which is something a lot of people struggle with when trying to quit weed. Please read that of you think it would help you.

PROS: I can confidently say that I no longer have a desire or ‚Äúcrave‚Äù to get high. That fades away the longer you stay sober, trust me.

DREAMS ! My ability to fall asleep without a mind altering substance has been fully restored (REM) and it is so true what they say. YOU WILL HAVE SOME CRAZY DREAMS. And I have had that, in fact one was so crazy I woke up and wrote it down in my notes just so I could look back at it lol.

APPETITE: I feel like I‚Äôm eating more now than I did when I smoked! Of course it took some time to get there, but yes I have a strong appetite and I‚Äôm probably gonna go get some food after I finish writing this. (2:23pm PA time)

THE BRAIN FOG: What fog ? All gone now. I can clearly think now and have big plans for my future that I now feel I can act on. I‚Äôm excited you see, and when I smoked, that excitement of what the future held was turned into anxiousness. No longer is that the case.

ENERGY: I wake up feeling like it‚Äôs the best day of my life, because it is ! God has blessed me with another day on this earth. I used to wake up, sit around in bed, hit my dab pen excessively, and not do much. Now I wake up, eat a balanced breakfast, and exercise and I feel great. So much energy that I never knew I had before because I was so out of it 24/7. 

Finally, SYMPTOMS: The weed induced symptoms are gone. Irritability, fog, appetite disorder, rem loss, it‚Äôs all gone. I know it‚Äôs only been 1 month, but for me this is a big accomplishment. I never knew how much my smoking was a problem before I stoped smoking. It‚Äôs not normal to be out of it all day everyday. You are a drug addict at that point. My message to everyone struggling right now is that it does get easier. I encourage everyone to write and post if they feel they need support at anytime during their journey. If you are still reading at this point, please leave a comment! Let me know if this is helpful and how far along you guys have come :) Cheers to one month clean !",9,0

WEED MAKES ME SMALL AND I AM FUCKING HUGE. I am powerful and MAGICAL and a BADASS BOSS BABE 

I need to be a clear channel for what needs to come through me.

I am a healer and an artist and a creator and it is my destiny to create safe spaces for those who are sober + seeking their higher selves.

I can focus more clearly on my relationship.

I have more time (and money!) for real self-care when I don‚Äôt smoke. 

Sore throat when I do smoke. 

Anxiety increases when I do smoke. 

I get super depressed when I smoke after a few days. And when I start smoking, I don‚Äôt stop (I can‚Äôt moderate).

I have more meaningful moments sober. 

I'm a healer - and I am becoming the best version of myself.

It really just makes me tired, and sometimes paranoid.

Today is day 9 of going sober after picking up smoking for a lot of reason but none were really that good to be honest. So here I am on day 9 feeling better about my health but not going to lie my mind is all over the place just as when I was smoking. But one thing ive know noticed that has stopped with going sober is my mind doesn‚Äôt drift away when doing things, when I am typing this I can focus better, when I speak with my family my head is there and I can respond really quick and that goes for my friends as well when we speak on discord. I speak a lot more now with them I tell them about things that they might not even care about my the good thing is I am expressing myself a lot more then before and I am really happy about that.

i make an update not long ago on this subreddit and I said it was a little hard and easy at the same time and that goes for today as well. One of the biggest things I have found is that my sleeping is worse in terms of the time I go sleep and wake up, but the sleep itself is fucking amazing like I have really good sleep when I do sleep and my dreams are really weird in a sense. I have a foot in my dream and one foot in the dream and I know I am dreaming and I can sometimes even do things in the dream that I want if that makes sense. 

Now but if I don‚Äôt keep myself busy throughout the day then I will have it on the back of my mind to phone my dealer but then I stop myself and remember why I am doing this and how the past few days will be a waste and stupid and I know that I will keep updating this subreddit on my sober journey and I don‚Äôt want to do that. I like myself in a few ways that I didn‚Äôt do before. 

Today I cut the grass and cleaned my loft for the pigeons that I keep and I felt really good tbh, other days I would clean the garden whilst Im stoned and it would take me ages I would work at my on pace then smoke again after finishing up but because I haven‚Äôt done this since Im going sober I felt like going across the road to buy again but didn‚Äôt want to. And besides I have been applying for a lot jobs that will ask me for a drug test and if keep smoking they won‚Äôt let me on to their company.

Quit for 6 months after graduating college. Started again for 4 years, only at night and sometimes weekends. I was completely depressed. No motivation. No ambition to get a better job. Then, I quit completely from the ages of 25-28 while I was pregnant/nursing my daughter. I definitely had severe post-partum anxiety.  

When I could get my hands on it again, I dove headfirst into smoking. Age 29-32 total blur. All I did was think about when I would be able to smoke and feel artificial happiness or numb. I smoked all day, everyday. I feel like I became really sick. Everything in the day to day felt so fucking boring. I could feel myself on the edge of really impulsive dangerous decisions, seeking a thrill. 

I quit for 6 months in 2018 to find/start a new job. My emotions were so fucked up during this time. I hated everyone and everything. So fucking miserable. I was overeating to ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù which was really just a way to hate myself more. Then my dad died, and I used it as an excuse to start again. I also used it as an excuse to not care about anything, even going to work on time or brushing my fucking teeth. 

Tried to quit again 6 months after my dads death but was going through some other relationship trauma that really fucked me up. So I‚Äôve been smoking ever since that trying to numb all the horrible pain and intrusive thoughts. 

When I‚Äôm high, I feel like I need to hide from everyone. I have the most ridiculous paranoid thoughts that I know are fucking stupid but I still buy into them. I lose all joy in other activities or people. All that brings me happiness is puffing on that stupid bong. Alone. And living in my imagination. Wishing to be someone I‚Äôm not. 

Cheers to being quit for good. I stopped 15 days ago. I did smoke one bowl, one night and it made me so angry. All I felt was that longing for more and I was so unsatisfied. I was full of rage on the come down.

So my life story: started smoking occasionally at 17. At 21 got out of a controlling and mentally abusive relationship, by this point I was smoking maybe every 3 or 4 days. That relationship left me with pretty bad anxiety due to constant comments and treatment from the Ex. After the break up I used weed as a crutch; it helped me sleep, it helped me eat (my appetite disappeared almost completely), it got me through the day. 

I'm 28 now. I've probably been smoking it every day since I was 21. I'm high functioning, I've been going to work stoned for years. I am capable of doing my ambitious to-do lists so this isn't a productivity issue. I do like weed, but I'd like to be a mother soon and also quit tobacco (I smoke my weed with rolling tobacco) for health reasons. I've tried vapes and pipes etc. but part of it for me is the ritual of smoking and passing (if I have company). So I always end up going back to joints. I have also tried quitting weed and taking up smoking but it doesn't hit the spot.

I've tried to quit a few times now, I had to quit once before because of funding issues, so I know I can do it. However I live with my SO and BIL, they both smoke. My SO works very hard to provide for us and I absolutely do not want to take smoke away from him. He deserves to enjoy what he's worked hard to earn. Regarding my BIL, he buys his own, he's an adult, I have no right in making him quit. But because of this I always end up caving because they'll be in the same room as me, or talk about it all the time. SO says he'd like to cut down before we have kids, but he has the same issue as me: BIL will literally stick it under our noses to show off what type he currently has or whatever.

I'm not looking for advice on getting them to quit or smoke outside etc. I'm looking for advice on how to quit when I'm around it most of the day. 

Thank you for listening, and thank you in advance for any advice or kind words.",7,0

Like most of us, started with a joint with a friend sometimes, once in two months, graduated to buying my own weed and slowly descended into smoking alone everyday.

For at least 4-5 years I have been smoking up nearly daily alone. And when friends came up on a weekend, then a full blown session through out the two days, just smoking eating and chilling.

The weekend sessions were fun, hanging out with you friends, watching movies, etc. Then we started going out for road trips every weekend, leave at Friday night, drive the whole night and be back for office by Sunday evening.

Christ, did we do some stupid things. Dazed, completely stoned driving on mountain roads in the middle of the night, pitch black. Used to have a rule at first, the driver wouldn't smoke up, but slowly the rule went out of the window with the smoke. Looking back, the stunts we have pulled, and think how dumbass lucky we were. Thankfully only once did we have a major accident and that effectively stopped the entire joyride for good. I guess it jolted us back to reality.

All this time, I convinced myself we were okay. All of us who smoked up together were top of their game, the best resources in their respective firms, bonuses and awards abound, but slowly, laying there stoned, all alone, the feeling of what-the-fuck started to creep up.

The day would start with me deciding not to smoke up tonight, but by the time the night rolled by, the day's load became a baggage and the joint seemed an escape to a tension free space. 

Past year, the number of times I regretted smoking up lying there 3AM on the bed increased and finally came to a point I felt miserable.

Penned this below a couple of years ago which sums up my thoughts,

-----

*Last four years have been a haze,*

*I can barely remember.*

*Where I have being,*

*Whom I have met,*

*What I have done,*

*Experiences come and go,*

*And all I do is hit another one.*


*Wanted to be someone growing up,*

*Someone big, someone known,*

*Someone powerful, someone grown,*

*Now that face that stares back from the mirror,*

*Is no one, just an empty shell, emotionally vacant.*


*Every morning, I think to myself,*

*Today is the day I going to end all in,*

*By the time the night comes around,*

*My hands are already rolling another 'J'.*


*When did my life becoming just about it?*

*About when we scoring it, when we smoking it?*

*Whose is gonna clean it, whose gonna roll it?*

*When did it take over my life and my mind,*

*As if there is nothing else in the world without it.*


*I wanna stop now, weed it out,*

*Rout it, slam it, throw it out,*

*No more cleaning, no more rolling,*

*No more high no more going low,*

*But my mind's weak and my hands in motion,*

*Why is that I can't even stop?*

This might be more of an r/relationshipadvice topic but....

I‚Äôve decided I need to quit using thc. 

I started in my early 20s and consider that entire decade lost to weed.  I quit for a few years when I got a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job and things started going great.  Got married, bought a house, things were looking up. 

Then my state legalized recreational cannabis.  About three years ago, my partner and I decided to be cheeky and try some edibles.  Had a blast and didn‚Äôt even have to mess around finding a dealer, just picked it up at the store!  

Well here I am today and you can probably guess what‚Äôs happened the last three years.  Sold the house because the responsibility was too much, so now we‚Äôre renting again.  I managed to not get fired from my job but I couldn‚Äôt handle the increasing responsibilities, so I resigned.  I still smoke everyday (except today...) 

Recently I set a rule for myself to not smoke in the house anymore, so I would jump on my bike and ride out and smoke along the trail.  This has worked pretty good to keep me a little regimented and give me something to look forward too...

Except now it was ruined biking, my favorite thing, because I can‚Äôt even think of going for a ride without weed.  It doesn‚Äôt even help. Just makes me slower, clumsier, self-conscious, and something extra to carry around.  

Back to the point, my SO.  She could smoke snoop dogg under the table and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm exaggerating.  She starts by 8-9 am with two or three huge bong rips, and repeats every hour or two until bed.  It doesn‚Äôt seem to affect her at all (we work together at home and she works circles around me, even with the bong rips), but I‚Äôm scared to see what she‚Äôs like after a few days of sobriety.  She is totally un-self conscious and unapologetic about it.  She‚Äôs not an annoying Kottonmouth Queen or anything like that, it‚Äôs just something she does and has to constantly plan around. 

I‚Äôve mentioned a few times that I‚Äôd like to quit or cut back, and here‚Äôs where the problem starts...every time I try to discuss MY habits and what I‚Äôd like to change, she takes it as a criticism of HER habits, and thinks I‚Äôm guilting her and accusing her of making me a pot head or something (which is kind of funny because she hadn‚Äôt smoked when we met lol).  These conversations always end up with me apologizing and consoling her.  I‚Äôm left totally unsupported, frustrated, and...you guessed it...biking my pipe and stash into the woods to chase a feeling I know isn‚Äôt there anymore.

So not only can I not expect to be in a weed free house after I quit, but we will have a new dynamic where my abstinence from weed smoking will be perceived as something I‚Äôm holding over her head.  That I‚Äôm quitting weed not as something to myself feel good, but to make her feel bad.  

I love my wife.  She is an incredible woman who is way out of my league if I‚Äôm being honest.  I‚Äôm just having a lot of trouble navigating this, and being in a fucking dark haze isn‚Äôt helping.  

I‚Äôve browsed the sub for a bit looking for posts about Leaving and relationships but didn‚Äôt really find anything, and wanted to get this off my chest. 

Can anyone speak to how Leaving has affected their relationships?",4,0
654,2020-06-15 01:53:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/h9a3je/first_week/,First week ‚úÖ,"Hi guys, 
I haven‚Äôt had weed for about a week now. I‚Äôm 17 years old about to turn 18 and I‚Äôve smoked weed on and off for about a year now. Sometimes I would do it multiple times in a day, and other periods I would only do it once a week. 

Why am I quitting?
Simple answer with multiple parts. 
First off, 
I have been depressed for the last couple years and weed doesn‚Äôt help that at all and demotivated me(which I will get into later).
Secondly,
 I have noticed problems with my memory and cognitive function. I‚Äôve always known that it wasn‚Äôt good for your brain, but I didn‚Äôt know that if you used it and you‚Äôre under 25 it can have serious long term problems on functionality (which I just started to notice recently). Not to toot my own horn or anything but I‚Äôm a pretty intelligent dude and I noticed my intelligence hasn‚Äôt been in the best shape lately which is why I want to stop.
Thirdly,
Weed makes me socially anxious. I‚Äôm generally pretty observant and can read people and generate an hypothesis of what‚Äôs going on in their head, but when I‚Äôm on weed that kicks into second gear and I can tell if people are annoyed with me (ex - body language). If I ever do it at a party I always feel unwelcome and stray which causes me to either go home or sit in a corner on my phone.
Lastly, 
Weed has this weird effect on me which idk if other people experience it. It makes my whole body sore and I can feel my bones ache. This started happening recently too which is a boost for my quitting. 

I am going to take a stand and finally quit this bad habit for good. You can all do it too, I believe in you.",2,0

I am almost a week completely free of weed, and for the first five days I have experienced levels of happiness, clarity, and present-mindedness that I didn't even think I was capable of achieving anymore. 

Today however, I feel like I'm retroactively experiencing months and maybe even years of sadness and frustration that weed was allowing me to ignore. Everything seems to be bubbling up to the surface. To anybody who might be experiencing emotions more acutely now that you're actually allowing your body and mind to fully feel them, don't give in. I've been crying off and on pretty much all day from painful memories all flooding my mind at once, but I can tell you that I haven't felt this alive in a very long time. I know it's a long overdue purge and I fully expect more days like this in the future. In the meantime, I'm embracing the vulnerability, and I am so happy and proud of myself in not feeling one ounce of temptation to get unreasonably high to numb the pain. 

Excited to share more in the weeks and months to come. Weed these days is so easily accessible and according to most people relatively harmless/risk-free, so communities like this are SO important. Thank you to everyone on here for being so transparent in your journey!",5,0

I am 18 years old and already ruined my brain. I started smoking at 16 and progressively got worse and worse over the past (almost) 3 years. At the worst points I would smoke multiple times a day, though a lot of the time in my addiction i was smoking about 4-5 times a week, more recently getting down to once a week and now none at all. The longest break I took was like a week for vacations and This is pretty much my longest break since I started smoking I think. I still have some at my house and I talk my self alllllmost into it but then slowly back out of smoking every single day. 


TRIGGER WARNING (SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH):
The reason I started smoking was partly recreational but was also to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù mental illness. I used to have an addiction to endorphins (cutting) which stemmed from depression and anxiety. the fact that smoking has less long term effects and felt nicer/was easier caused me to trade addictions and made this seem extremely harmless. For a while I felt It was helping me to ‚Äúcalmly face‚Äù aspects of my past or things about myself I didnt want to think about, and felt it made me more creative and social, but eventually it took negative tolls on all of those aspects and had the opposite effects. I do think smoking helped me stop cutting and learn to De-escalate anxious situations, but I took it sooo far beyond that. Smoking was also a cross addiction with masturbation I think which made it hard to stop too.  



Now that my head is slowly clearing, I realize i am definetly not as sharp as I once was. Throughout my addiction I continued to succeed on tests and in classes, so I used this as an excuse that nothing was wrong, but in reality the full scope of intelligence isn‚Äôt measured by these metrics and I‚Äôve definitely lost a lot of things like foresight/the ability to plan for the long term like future careers, and a lot of the inner thoughts and connections I would make on a daily basis in the process of analyzing everything idk how to explain it but the functioning is so much less aware I guess.... 

Ive been reading about egg donation and realized that substance abuse prevents you from beinf a candidate, and after researching i found that through epigenetic inheritance, the increased levels of reward chemicals in the bloodstream may alter the response pathways in the females eggs? And thus the children‚Äôs predisposition to drug abuse or risky behaviors I think is the supposed symptom... no matter what it is it‚Äôs kinda shitty to realize I may have already harmed my future children and i didn‚Äôt really consider I would be potentially giving them memory problems or any kind of issues at age 16 

My dad is getting older and i notice that he likes to retell stories a lot and the way his memory attatches strongly to certain prominent events and always goes back to the same pathways when he hears certain ‚Äúkey words‚Äù like that‚Äôs the only search result... I wonder if I‚Äôll even have anything to contribute to conversations when I‚Äôm old or if I‚Äôll experience this effect exaggerated like by just loosely tying a select few talkinf points to every single topic Lolol just because its all I can think of (not saying that‚Äôs necessarily what my dad does idk) 

In general, smoking wasn‚Äôt worth it and I‚Äôm starting to get anxious about the long term now that I‚Äôm sober. I wish I could havr taken a long proper break to assess the impact of the effects before now, but I felt extremely dependent on it. If anyone hasn‚Äôt quit yet, I urge you to at least take this time during quarantine to take a proper break, multiple weeks long, when you can remember what it was like to be sober and realize if you‚Äôve changed. Anyways I hope everyone can stay strong and heal. Peace and love",2,1

Here‚Äôs some background.. 

Basically me and my partner split up about 6 months ago, before that we dated for 2 years and were best friends for 4 years. She gave me my first joint and ever since then we‚Äôve always smoked a ton of weed together all the time. However she has been my rock and other half for so long and we‚Äôre basically the same person when it comes to views, aspirations, morals, etc. We made a mutual decision that we would break up (which we‚Äôve done twice before) because we wanted to work on ourselves and fulfill our internal relationships. . But instead of doing that internal work, I‚Äôve been getting dumb high every day since we broke up ( like an 8th a day just for myself) We work at a cannabis grow, where high THC content is abundant and we smoke almost every other hour. And I also see her everyday as a co-worker/friend which always rips open the hole that‚Äôs in my chest that‚Äôs trying to heal. 

Today was fucking brutal to say the least, every negative emotion that‚Äôs been suppressed the past 6 months came out full force and with a vengeance. I was angry, sad, annoyed, and in a rage. I about lost my shit, I punched a few inanimate objects and cried a lot..I felt crazy

I cant even pinpoint when i first started smoking weed. I think my first time was inside of my house whenever my parents left for a concert for a few hours and i had no idea about weed but me and my friend invited these two guys over and they brought a joint, i had no clue it smelled so bad so i insisted we light it up in the house and next thing you know they‚Äôre running out the door because my parents came home and my friend is running frantically around my house spraying febreeze. 

Anyways, after that time i didn‚Äôt smoke again til i had this boyfriend who smoked a bit in 2015. I smoked with him a few times but rarely; i didn‚Äôt like it that much nor cared about it. I had a really good friend who smoked often and was much older than me. at this point i didnt really care about weed but when i smoked with her i didn‚Äôt feel much so i was whatever about it. It wasn‚Äôt til 16‚Äô-17‚Äô that i started smoking more often, me and the boyfriend i was talking about before were on and off all the time we smoked together sometimes, i‚Äôd light up in my room at night with a sploof i made from a toilet paper roll, dryer sheets, and a sock. i‚Äôd light up with my best friend sometimes if we could get out during the day but mostly just at night. i had a few boyfriends who smoked so i smoked a lot with them. all my friends used to come over and we‚Äôd smoke in my room out the window, get super high and watch movies and spend hours in my room giggling and taking videos and pictures and laughing for hours and hours having a genuinely good time. we did this every night for a year or so. maybe longer. a long time. if i wasn‚Äôt with a friend i was smoking on my own at night. i always smoked more than my friends but i never acknowledged it or cared. it didn‚Äôt make me feel anxious or different or depressed at this point. i was having fun w it and all my friends and me loved smoking. it was our thing. 

i ended up leaving school and going to cyber school feb of 2018 and my life only went downhill from
there. I don‚Äôt wanna get into explaining everything but I wasn‚Äôt an anxious person ever, not socially, not at all. not a panic attack ever in my life. i‚Äôve always had depression and a little bit of anger from a bad past and just shitty things that have happened. honestly i thought some people were crazy for having bad anxiety but that was because i didn‚Äôt understand, i feel bad all the time now for thinking it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. I would occasionally get nervous for things like interviews and meeting new people that i pursued interest in but both of those things are fairly normal things to be nervous about. i didn‚Äôt worry much, i always had adhd but it started to calm down as i got older, i was outgoing, personable, had many friends, loved being around people, and always wanted to do things. whenever i left school i definitely started to smoke way more because i was able to. basically i was carefree, had a little bit of trauma from my ex boyfriend and had a lot of shitty friendships but i was generally pretty happy and enjoyed life for the most part. i was good at work and loved doing things. during all of this i was smoking but not all day but mostly every day and then more frequently as time went on. 

i started to notice anxiety more during the summer of 2019 maybe a little bit before then. things that never had made me nervous before started to, i started to not want to be around people more, and i started panicking and getting sick more. i ended up getting caught w weed i was charged and arrested. it showed me that i needed to chill, i didn‚Äôt, then a month later i got arrested again for the same thing in the same spot by the same police officer that arrested me one month prior on the same day. i kept smoking all day every day. i convinced my parents to let me
smoke in my house because of the arrests and it worked. i was able to smoke at home in a safe space but at this point it‚Äôs towards the end of summer and i‚Äôm starting to notice the anxiety. summer ended and i stopped being friends w a lot of people, met some shitty people, then lost people again. i started to lose friends slowly and socially isolated myself more and more. smoked more and more to get away from my problems, try to feel better, etc. 

fast forward to feb of 2020, i finally got my med card and now my anxiety is worse than ever. i now feel socially anxious and paranoid constantly. it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly how it all happened and the time frame because not only is my anxiety horrible but so is my memory, my depression, my motivation. i wake up in the morning with panic attacks so bad, my heart races my body sweats profusely, i throw up, i shake, and it isn‚Äôt til i smoke weed that i feel better. the only thing that makes sense to me is in the morning i don‚Äôt have much weed in my system and i‚Äôm not very high so i start going through small withdrawals. at first weed made me so happy. me and my friends loved it. it wasn‚Äôt til i started to depend on it more that it didn‚Äôt become fun. i relied on it. i smoked all the time. every day. now i smoke a g of wax in a day plus other things like bud and carts. i go to the dispensary all the time. i‚Äôm an anxious, paranoid, depressed mess. i just quit my job because i have to stop smoking and i know it‚Äôs gonna be hell once i do so i‚Äôm going to get better and then figure all of this out before i can get another job. i cant even go out in public without panicking about it. i hate going to the doctors and the dentist because i hate having to talk to them. i‚Äôm constantly paranoid bad things are going to happen and i overthink every aspect of everything. i‚Äôm nervous around my friends which is especially frustrating. i‚Äôm nervous around extended family i only really feel comfort w my mom. i dont ever feel like doing anything and nothing makes me happy anymore. the anxiety hinders my ability to think straight so when i‚Äôm anxious i cant think and i just look stupid to the person i‚Äôm talking to creating more anxiety.  i obsess and fixated on certain things sometimes or certain things people say that i just can‚Äôt let go because i overthink it. i thought weed was helping my anxiety and that i just developed it because i left school but no no. i never felt like this til i started smoking regularly. ever. 

i‚Äôve now read tons of threads about people experiencing the same or similar thing. i‚Äôm sorry this story is so scattered but i‚Äôm wondering if anyone else can tell me if something similar has happened and how they got better. I‚Äôm afraid for the next few months  i know it‚Äôs going to be extremely difficult because at this point i‚Äôve been smoking nonstop for a couple years now. i haven‚Äôt ever taken a break for any amount of time. i need help and i‚Äôm so upset i let it get this bad. i cant even think straight anymore at all it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm living in a hazy dream all day every day and it‚Äôs felt like that for a while now. like nothing‚Äôs real. i do feel suicidal thoughts sometimes and the more i smoke the more i feel then get worse over time because i just become so unmotivated and sad and lazy. sometimes i‚Äôll get small spikes of a feeling of happiness during the day but it lasts two seconds and it reminds me of what happiness used to feel like. i hope to find some guidance through this post.


I forgot to add how badly smoking affects my work ability. I have panic attacks before I go to work because i don‚Äôt want to see people and it definitely slows me down a bit. i hate working and being able to feel everyone‚Äôs emotions constantly from each person i work with. I also am super irritable all the time. Little things that never bothered me before bother me now and every little thing sometimes just irritates me for no reason.",1,0

I got really sick and tired of wanting to get high when sober, and then when high, I remember the things that I said I want to start doing while sober, but then sobertime comes and it's back in the cycle again. Weed's defense mechanism is it fogs the brain up, so that it makes us think we can't live, do, or be a certain way without being high from weed. Insidious nature. I can't remember where this quote is from, but they said ""Once you experience the high that weed gives you, you can now get to that state of mind without weed.""

My plan for this year was to no longer use weed. When this pandemic stuff started going on, I went back down into the cannahole.

This morning I decided to meditate on what I should do for my weed habit. It was a very powerful experience. The meditation did the work for me and in these steps it allowed me to see everything from a higher dimension.

1. Close your eyes and observe your thoughts and life from a third person spectator view.
2. Now let go of everything and fall back into your center being.
3. Remain in your pure center being, and then naturally everything will come to balance.

I still had quite a bit of weed left and a vape pen, and threw those out today during a bike ride. I would much rather focus on my creative work while sober and clear headed, than be stoned and worry about when I'm going to be stoned again. Time to be in the present moment.

Also I am wondering, has anyone here replaced weed with the study and practice of astral projection?

I presume this is going to be a long post. Apologies if you don't wanna read through it all, I miiight include a TLDR or whatever it's called (non-native speaker here).

I've been smoking weed since I was 16, it became an everyday habbit at around 18 when I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years. The whole breakup was..probably the biggest hurdle of my life. I don't believe I've felt such pain or hopelessness up to date. Since I was already smoking semi-regularly (couple of times a week at that point) and I already had some issues with booze I decided to pick up the j instead of the bottle. It worked to some extend - the apathy I felt was squashed by the high and since I smoked at every possible time - the apathy was almost non-existened. 

Fast forward a couple of months and I move out of my parents house with my best bud, with whom I've been smoking this whole time. He actually introdused me to weed. Well, this every day habit became smoking about a gram a day spread around into 4-5 j's (with tobacco). I did not think much of it at the time - I was exceeding at my job, found a new plase, was feeling better metally and why in the world would I cut down or stop?!

Well, this got old quick. I quit my job because I felt that my responsibilities rose, but my salary - not as much. Found a worse job. Then an even worse job. Weed consuption remained the same, mainly because I couldn't afford to smoke more. This wen't on for about 2-3 years in which I changed a couple of jobs, all working at a callcentre because that's the only thing I was good at. Oh, I also dropped out of Uni.

So, we are at summer of 2019 - been smoking for a couple years as much as possible. No money. Lost a bunch of weight. My social circle was non-existend besides the aforementioned buddy and other people who smoke. 0 actual relationships, but a bunch of friends with benefits (which meant I was doing alright RIGH!? lol no..). Due to financial issues we had to move back to our parents' houses because we couldn't keep living like this. 

My folks absolutely disapprove of my smoking and they've no idea how much I smoke. They thought it was once every couple of months on occasion. Moving back, they surely saw it wasn't like that - I left the house every single night for 2-3 times to ""go to the shop"" - well, I was in the park next to the flat smoking my brains out. I found a new girlfriend - that's a whole other story, but just to mention - my addiction fucked that up as well. I think you guys get the idea.

Now, I've moved back with the same buddy to another apartment. At this point I've made about a hundred attempts of quitting, the most successful one was 3 days. Currently, I'm on day 2 and I'm not sure how I feel. I'm sweating like crazy, emotions are all over the place, I just wanna smoke and feel normal..but I know that's the monkey on my back talking. I walked about 7 kilometres today and hit the gym, although  I couldn't finish the workout cause I felt physically sick. I think the only reason I made it through last night was because I drank, but I don't wanna do that tonight - obviously don't wanna swap one addiction for another.  

I know the best time to stop would've been years ago. I also know that the second best time is now. I do feel determined, but along that determination I feel extreme anxiaty and depression, which I've also felt since the big breakup, but been numbing all this time. I'm not sure how I'm gonna go to bed tonight, especially sober. But I know I have to. Tomorrow as well.  I've been lurking here for atleast 2 years, I may have even made a post in the past. I feel like I pretty much know all the tips and tricks you could give me. This post is not because of this.

This post is to vent. To put things in perspective for myself. To..idk, to maybe help someone on day 2 to not feel as alone. I really hope you guys reach back with some words of encouragement and hope. Also, if anybody wants to DM and tryout like a sponsor thing (got this from AA and NA forums and discussions) - I'm totally down. 

Love you guys. Really. And I hope you are staying strong and doing the best you can. 

Your friends,

Peter",3,0

This will be a very long read, but I hope that for some of you it contains valuable information in order to overcome obstacles in your way or maybe I sparkle your motivation to keep going! The journey is definitely worth it, I can promise you that.

Oh yea, I am from Germany, so the grammar / spelling may not always be flawless, but I hope it doesn‚Äôt disturb the reading experience too much and you can still get something out of it.

Background

I am now 26, started smoking weed about five years ago and went through the common transformation. First I smoked when my friends had a joint, then I bought my first own weed, then I learnt how to roll etc. But at that point weed wasn‚Äôt that much of a deal for me. I had some friends who were really into weed and partying but also a lot of friends who were into personal development, so I was always in balance and weed never really became a major priority in my life. But two years ago I moved into a new town to study and then things changed. I met a lot of friends around 20 / 22 whose only point in life was to party and smoke weed. At that point I was already 24, finished three years of job training and I knew exactly where I wanted to go in life ‚Äì or so I thought. Now I only had friends who were focused on weed and partying and I didn‚Äôt realize how much of a sponge to the people around I was‚Ä¶ until it was too late. I started smoking daily, at first at my neighbors place (because I was really unhappy with the flat I lived in I tried not to spend much time there), but soon alone and every day. It all got worse when I moved out to live alone and now I was 25, smoking about one gram of weed every day all by myself. My grades got worse, my body got worse, my relationships got worse and my mind got worse. My whole personality changed, the optimistic and always happy man I was turned into a miserable and constantly tired old man who looked unhealthy as fuck. And I didn‚Äôt even care. All I cared about was going home and being stoned. The only good thing that happened to my in that time was that I discovered producing music as a hobby and since I didn‚Äôt do anything else with my life I spent a hell lot of time with it. I tried to quit from time to time but always tricked myself back into smoking daily. Until that one night: It was three in the morning, I was baked as f*ck but still unable to sleep. Earlier that day I talked to one of my friends and he said one bad thing about me, which usually wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me, but my mind kept rotating about it on and on and I couldn‚Äôt stop it and suddenly all those feeling that I tried to suppress that rose up. I felt so shocked ‚Äì literally pain in my heart ‚Äì and I started crying really loud. I reached my lowest point and I knew I need to change something. But I also knew that if I‚Äôd quit, I‚Äôd just slip right back into the addiction so I decided one thing that made all the difference: I wrote my brother about my situation. Me and my brother are very close, he knew I smoked weed, but he really didn‚Äôt know how much weed I smoked and how addicted I was. We made a bet: Three months without weed, if I fail once, I‚Äôll get professional help. And I really didn‚Äôt want to get professional help (which I funny enough later on still did), so I was motivated. I got up, threw my entire weed stock (ca. 1g) away and swore to myself to never smoke again.

Day 1-30 ‚Äì Overcoming the pain

The first 30 days sucked so hard. The first two weeks I barely slept. I was constantly angry and / or sad. What made it even worse is I quit cigarettes too, so my dopamine system was completely confused (I really don‚Äôt know if I can recommend quitting two things at once. For me it was the best way, but for others it may be better to first quit weed and then cigarettes). I randomly started crying in the bus or at home and had literally no motivation to do anything. But what really helped me was my brother regularly checking in on my progress. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt lie to him if I relapsed and I didn‚Äôt want to seek professional help and therefore I was determined to keep going. I named this chapter ‚ÄúOvercoming the pain‚Äù because that‚Äôs what these first 30 days really were for me. A daily struggle of feeling tired, foggy, sad, angry, irritated and literally every bad emotion one could imagine. For me personally the first 30 days were not the time to start changing anything in my life yet. The first 30 days were simply and pure discipline and struggle. What helped me a lot was having my brother (and later on my dad, who I told next) constantly checking in on me and supporting me. Having people with you on that journey is very helpful, even strangers e.g. this community can help a lot. Whenever I was tempted, I just wrote here and overcame the temptation.

Month 2 - 3 ‚Äì Picking up the pieces

With the withdrawal symptoms slowly becoming much easier to handle, I managed to move onto the next phase of my process: Facing reality. Over the past two years my life became significantly worse because of my weed consumption and I consumed much more weed to be able to ignore that fact. Now without the weed I had to face the reality. Luckily because I was really into self-development before, I had ways to approach the situation. My first step was honest self-reflection to find out what and who exactly makes me unhappy. If I started randomly crying (which happened much less frequently at that point) I tried to find out what it was that triggered that emotion. If I felt the urge to smoke weed again, I tried to find out what triggered that urge. It turned out that a lot of my pain was rooted in a deep loneliness that I felt in my new town. Sure I had many friends, but the majority of them were weed friends, and I quickly learnt, that weed friends are rarely ever more than weed friends. It‚Äôs usually an unwritten contract between two people to constantly validate each other‚Äôs self-destructive lifestyle. Once that‚Äôs gone, the friendship is gone. Sure I still have contact to some of them, but to the majority I‚Äôve not spoken in ages and I am very sure that‚Äôs a good thing as I think its reasonable to find friends that are good for me. I spent month two and three figuring out what I actually want. Why I originally moved to my new town and how I managed to go that far away from my goals. Some of the things that dragged me down: My unhealthy relationships, my body, my lack of effort in university, my inability to stand up for myself, my massive porn consumption, my dirty apartment, my unhealthy nutrition, my knees constantly hurting, my lack of friends in my new town, my lack of self-esteem etc‚Ä¶. It was painful to realize all these things, but on the other hand I now knew what I had to work on, in order to feel better. Only by through facing everything that dragged me down, I empowered myself to pull me up.

Month 3 ‚Äì 4 - Building a solid foundation

Now I knew what dragged me down, but how to overcome it? My solution was to change step by step. Contrary to how two minute Hollywood montages make people believe, real change is a very slow and steady process. What would it help me if I fixed my nutrition, started exercising regularly and do all I need to do for university if I just quit after two weeks because it‚Äôs too much for me? What I instead did was introducing healthy habits to replace my unhealthy ones. Once I managed to do one habit every day for two weeks, I introduced another one. That way I managed to introduce many positive habits in my life, for example meditation, drinking a self-made green smoothie every day, daily stability / flexibility training, daily journal etc. All these little actions didn‚Äôt immediately make my life better, but they for sure gradually improved the quality of all other activities in my life. Also another big factor that supported my positive development was the fact that I accepted to visit therapy. I wrote before that I was very reluctant to use professional help. Maybe I felt it would put me on the same level as a ‚Äòserious drug‚Äô addict. Maybe it felt like a confession that I cannot handle the situation on my own. Maybe I was simply ashamed and afraid. And although I accept those feelings, I have to admit that the therapy really helped me so much in order to move on. Not once did I feel shame and neither should you, if you consider getting help. It‚Äôs not a sign of weakness (as I felt) but a sign of character strength, honesty and commitment. I can encourage anyone to get professional support in order to overcome this. What also helped me a lot was the fact that my hobby of music production got much better. I was afraid that without weed I wouldn‚Äôt put that much time into it, because with weed I could literally spend 4-5 hours nonstop producing music and enjoying every single second of it. Turns out, I can do the same thing without weed+ I now have the discipline to watch tutorials and constantly improve myself. So finding positive hobbies (I started playing badminton for example) and improving old positive habits while continually replacing my damaging one really supported me. Oh yea I also tried quitting porn a couple of times, which turned out to be even tougher then quitting weed. The fact that it was so hard for me to quit was a good indicator that I should address that issue. But now I rarely ever look at porn and it certainly has improved the quality of my life. I don‚Äôt agree with the NoFap pseudoscience and ‚Äòsuperpowers‚Äô but porn certainly messes with your dopamine system and jerking off two or three times a day probably isn‚Äôt beneficial for relationships.

Month 4 ‚Äì 7 ‚Äì Improving life

After four months I felt like my life improved faster. The downward spiral (Life is shit > smoke more weed > life is more shit > smoke more weed etc.) now turned into an upward spiral. I believe that every single bad decision you make accumulates into a huge pile of shit (that was my life essentially) but also every good decision I make accumulates into a huge pile of‚Ä¶ something good and meaningful. The struggle of the past months paid off. My mood changed, I got happier and optimistic again. I slept much better and felt much more energetic every day. My apartment looks clean, I actually renovated some parts of it and because I saved so much money I was able to buy better equipment for my music production. I reactivated old friendships, especially in my hometown in order to have people to communicate about self-development and let negative friendships fade out. Of course I wasn‚Äôt suddenly all happy and sunshine. I still had bad days. I still relapsed with porn from time to time. I still had days where I just wanted to buy weed and smoke. On New Year I actually smoked a cigarette, but it almost made me vomit, so it made it even easier for me not smoke cigarettes. But overall my life was on an overall higher level. Some friends noticed that my skin improved. Others noticed that I sound much happier with myself. And also my therapist noticed a lot of positive changes and we decided to only meet once every two weeks. What was a big challenge for me was identifying and tackling the deeper routed feelings that caused my addictive pattern. I started working on addressing and readjusting these emotions. This is way too personal for me to go into detail and if you‚Äôre interested in finding out, I would recommend consulting professional help because without it you can potentially really mess with your mind. Also I worked on re-discovering old and setting new goals for myself that I work towards. I built myself a solid foundation by establishing positive habits into my life and then started to figure out a long term path forward. Those two things combined with all the other ‚Äòlittle things‚Äô (therapy, my family, hobbies etc.) really had a positive influence on me.

Month 8-9 ‚Äì The challenge

But everything changed, when the Coronavirus attacked‚Ä¶ Suddenly I was stuck at home, no work, no gym, no friends to meet and no routine to follow. This was really difficult. The first week I drank a lot of alcohol for four days in a row. But then I thought: Quitting weed just to become an alcoholic? This is the worst trade deal in history‚Ä¶ maybe ever. I realized that this is a challenge, but also a way to prove to myself that I really did change over the past few months and it wasn‚Äôt all talk. And suddenly I started to work so hard on my university stuff. I preemptively finished two papers that are due in September and almost finished two other ones, while simultaneously starting my BA-thesis. Now that the lockdown is slowly over, I am actually ahead of all of my friends who spent the lockdown drinking, smoking etc. I am not saying that to brag or to look down on my friends. I am saying that because the only reason that was possible is because I quit smoking weed. If I still smoked weed, the past two months would have set me back so much. 

All the things I have accomplished over the past nine months were only possible because I quit smoking weed. And I still get the urge to smoke from time to time. But I sit down and compare the pros and cons of smoking. And if I am honest, I cannot really come up with any other pros but ‚ÄúI‚Äôll feel nice for some time‚Äù. But I can come up with a massive amount of cons. I am proud to say today that I don‚Äôt smoke weed anymore and I will never smoke weed again in my life. And I truly hope that every single one of you will also reach that point ‚Äì I am certain that you all can! If you‚Äôre reading this and you feel the temptation to smoke weed, feel free to send me a private message, I‚Äôll answer you as soon as possible! You‚Äôre not alone on this journey and you most certainly will not feel alone after you complete this journey! Hang in there my friend, I believe in you! I hope this text gave some of you inspiration or advice. If you have any further question, feel free to comment.

Have a good evening my friends <3",164,4

Is this the old me or a new version of the old me?,"Today is the 3rd day. And the first one was rough, I'll admit. Trying to reason with myself that I could have another and quit on monday, instead of friday. Or that I would maybe consume my stash and then quit, as I wont have any more (and getting more is a very big hassle).  


But now, on this sunday evening, on my 3rd day I feel oddly great.   
My saturdays and sundays used to last for about 3-4 hours (in terms of what I would do and could achieve and so forth). These two days have had all the actual hours in it. Yesterday I did some gardenwork, some cleaning in the toolshed, some work on some 3d printer projects, started painting some minis. Worked on my (tabletop) gaming room. Played a bunch of WoW. Played some more. Watched some shows on Youtube. Cleaned the apartment a bit. Worked on a start-up project of my own. And I still found myself constantly finding more activities and things to do.  


While bunch of my activities have been to keep my mind busy and off from thinking about smoking, I am downright amazed with what I could achieve and do during one single day. I used to think saturdays were real short and you couldn't really do too much during those days and they would just go by.  


But yeah. It has been oddly cool. And while I initially thought I would kick this addiction and would eventually be a recreational occasional smoker - I no longer want that. I want to be clean of that stuff and enjoy this clarity.  


How long this will last, we'll see. But the start has been amazing. And with monday around the corner, I feel like this next week will be a real challenge that I must face.   
And one that needs to be overcome.",9,0

""Hey there my friend. I know you've had a tough year. You never meant to become addicted to Cannabis. You were just playing around, trying capture a different part of yourself. You wanted good things from the plant. You wanted enlightenment, you wanted to enhance pleasure, and you wanted to relieve anxiety so you could be a better person. You wanted some of the weight of life off your shoulders, cause life has been hard. 

You never expected to go through a heavy withdrawl, and you never expected things would get so far out of control so fast. You were promised the plant wasn't addictive. You looked into your medical history, and everything seemed ok. It was supposed to be legal, and better for you than booze. You saw advertisements before movie trailers, had fit people telling you to use it. No one ever fully explained the risks, because no one really understands the risks.  You went in too hard and fast.  But you didn't really understand. 

I know you've blamed yourself alot for everything. It's understandable. But you can let it go. I've come to tell you some great news.

3 years from now everything is so much better.

Me, your 40 year old self, is having a great time.

All that gross brain fog is gone. You and your girlfriend have a house. You are living a life of sustainable fitness and sobriety. And you are MENTALLY STRONG. Never are you tempted by booze or weed anymore, or even porn, as you've given that up now for some time. Your Yoga and meditation practice continue to be strong. You've learned you have an addictive personality, but it's no longer a weakness, but a STRENGTH. You've learned to channel your power to become focused on all the things that matter, and to do it in a sustainable way.

The changes in your brain really happened slowly. It took a long time I know, but now sky is clear and the sun is shining. You've saved so much money from withholding from your addictions. You've been able to afford a dog, and a new badass tattoo, and you now live in a house. You are serving your community so much better at work and at home. 

And the beauty is not only are you are so healthy now, you probably have another 40-50 years of life to enjoy it. 

You've made it out of the darkness of your early withdrawl, and because you've healed a little, now you will believe me and know that you will one day be completely healed.

Your friends and girlfriend love you more than ever, and you sobriety inspires others. You even help people to overcome substance issues. When someone needs a helping hand or shoulder, you lend it to them.

Write me a letter anytime, you've got this buddy. Congrats on 9.5 months clean and 9.5 months wiser.

And congrats on being a better person. 

Love,

40 year old you. (3 years in the future)",25,0

I started tracking walks with an app so I can keep the pace up and push for improvements.  This is part of something I am looking into as an alternative to outright running.  My knees probably prefer this.  

I was thinking about how certain levels of activity alter my state of mind.  I saw an old friend along the way and I felt buzzed when I was talking to him.  I suppose this is what some would call a runners high.

The big difference is that this type of high takes some time and effort to get the buzz as opposed to a quick puff of cannabis.  The quick fix we have been using weed for is too good to be true in the longrun.

Trying to accept that I'm really an addict, but cannot imagine life completely without weed.

This is loooong..

As I assume a lot of prople here, instantly fell in love with weed when I first tried it; it didn't just make everything more enjoyable and interesting, it also boosted my creativeness immensely. When I started daily use, it seemed to help with depression, which I've battled with since my late tweens (43 now). 

For years, I was a very infrequent user (think once or twice a year) but that was because I live in an illegal country, and availability used to be really poor. That has changed in the past few years, and despite still being completely legal it's actually qiite easy to get. So I started vaping and smoking more and more frequently, untill about a two years ago I started vaping daily. I tried to quit this January and made it to 2 months before first relapse. Since then, the relapses were at first once a week, and now I'm back to dailyy use. 

Over the time, the high changed from non-stop laughter to more ""serious"" - a lot of philosophical thought, spending time reading a lot of interesting books, writing. It was still immensely enjoyable, but to it didn't even seem I was high. I could ""pass"" as sober, so I could keep my all-day-everyday habit a secret"", to the extend I was able to be high at work. (university faculty). Name it, I've done it high. A vaporizer allows to be very descreet. Even my partner didn't know the extent of my use, and he was still worried about me deceloping addiction. He had no idea how bad it was already.

The thing is: weed hardly even have any effect anymore. I feel a bit ""foggy"" for 30 minutes, there's hardly any enjoyment.

Also, I have to sneak around to vape; my partner thinks I quit in January and that I'd throw everything out. I promised I would, I did not, so now there's this horrible lie between us. If he found out, I could lose my family, as he probably wouldn't be able to get over the betrayal. So it brings me guilt and shame, and does not help my depression and anxiety at all.

And I STILL KEEP DOING IT! I still keep chasing that high, which I know, intellectually, is not happening. I feel disgusted by myself, but I cannot quit - the idea of never vaping/smoking just feels unbearable

I'm an addictive personality, and used to binge drink, but I quit alcohol cold-turkey ~12 years ago, zero relapses. At least for me, weed is way, way more addictive than alcohol. I used to feel weed was almost ""magical"" in it's impact on me, something I never felt that way about alcohol as it only had negative effects. I actually mourn the fact that I've ""ruined"" weed. If I had used moderately, I could probably still enjoy the ""magic"".

I'll run out soon, and because of Corona I'll be unable to get more (there's no way I'd be able to do it without my partner knowing as we're socially isolated). For the life of me I cannot make myself throw it out the small stash I still have, and I'm anxious about running out.

Sorry for the wall of text, I just had to write this down. I have to come to terms with my situation: I'm an addict, I sneak and lie to people closest to me, I'm clearly ok with risking losing everything I have.",65,1

I'm a 43F, and today is my first day without weed.
I must say that I'm very happy with the progress I've done. Ten years ago, I would drink and smoke weed every day apart from my regular cigarettes (I used to smoke around a pack a day).

Drinking now only happens on some birthdays, and I quit weed and cigarettes in 2018. First I stopped smoking weed and after a month or so I stopped with cigarettes.

My plan with weed was only to do it recreationally, like I did with alcohol. So after a few months I started smoking weed only in special occasions and not mixed with tobaco. After that I went to mixing it with tobaco. After that, a lot of excuses became special occasions and I ended up smoking week with tobaco every friday, saturday and sunday but sometimes it's also on thursday.

As I read in other posts I'm not even enjoying smoking so I find it very stupid that I'm smoking.

I must say that quiting cigarettes was super easy to me. I substituted my morning cigarettes for yoga and now I'm doing yoga every morning, plus skating or more yoga in the evenings. Now, with the covid situation (I have not seen my family since december) and things at work are the worst so I need to keep strong to not fall again.

I noticed that yoga helps a lot so I will even do more yoga? What are your tips guys? Every weekend it seems I convince myself to smoke again because I am so healthy during the week, i am doing so much better than before, work stress, etc

Yesterday i search this sub, and I find it very inspiring .

Eating has gotten incredibly difficult.  Before I started smoking, I was having issues with eating due to side effects from anti-anxiety medication.  Smoking became my crutch to help me eat, and now 6yrs later, it feels like I'm back in that same state.  I'm really trying to stay positive that my body just needs an adjustment period, and then food will be easier.  It's the weirdest experience, because I will even FEEL HUNGRY but still struggle to eat???  Like what does my body even WANT?

The other main challenge right now is trying to handle the moments / times when I would have been smoking.  Like the ritual of getting things set up (especially before a meal) and the late-night moments when I would reach over to take a hit.  It feels...empty?  One thing that has helped is lighting candles - to replace those moments of taking a hit.  It might be strange, but still getting to use the lighter for a purpose (lighting the candle instead of the bud) is helping me fill those times that feel 'empty'.

Anyway, thanks for reading this if ya did!  Just getting it out of my head and into writing has been therapeutic.

This is my 4th or 5th attempt over 3 years, after 7 years of abuse. If anyone saw my post earlier this day will see that this year has been incredibly turbulent, yet despite the chaos and pain, it all had to happen.

I've just had somewhat of an epiphany on why previous attempts have failed, and how this time truly feels different. Its because this time i want to quit for ME. In the past, i have quit primarily for finances, at a breaking point where i cannot afford to continue, the idea that quitting would allow me to take on more hours and pressure at work, and that a period of abstinence would act as a tolerance break, allowing me more bang for my buck and to develop a 'healthier', more sustainable relationship with weed. Which, as someone with a substance abuse problem is an impossibility. So of course a relapse will always be an inevitability, the idea of stopping forever being too painful. 

However, i've finally reached the point of realising how detrimental it has been to my mental health. Thats whats so insidious about weed, to me it never felt like an unhealthy habit (Well, apart from the insane amount of sugar consumption from munchies), no hangover the next day or sense of damage, whereas a binge of opiates for example feels more physically taxing and more likely to deter me from compulsive use. Not that i never fell into that trap, however it only took slipping into that addiction once to realise i wasn't going back to it. Yet with weed, i keep subjecting myself to this torment over and over, expecting each subsequent relapse to be different from the last and that i would somehow manage to moderate my usage. But once you've reached that point of having to moderate or regulate your usage, you know you're too far down the rabbit hole and that a healthy relationship with it isn't likely attainable. 

This time is different. I see now the illusory veil it cast on me. I started using to manage my emotions and mental health issues. Then it soon became the very source of these issues. I needed to get as bad as i did last month in order to reach this conclusion. I was aware for a while that it was detrimental to my hobbies and motivations, and that to some extent it was fuelling my anxiety. I never wanted to stop for good, just for a while. And that's the trap. And it made quitting attempts so much worse because it felt like i was depriving myself of something that i'd inevitably be using again in the near future. But now i'm adamant that part of my life is over, i've been able to focus more on my passions and hobbies, more proactive about learning healthier methods of mood regulation And the withdrawals have been infinitely better. Still sucks, but much more manageable knowing that this is the last time i'll have to go through it. It's time to move on and reclaim the life that i let slip from my fingers. This time i can and will do it. For myself, and for those im fortunate enough to have in my life. Because soon enough this awful addiction would have surely taken that from me also, along with all the time and money it's already claimed.

Thanks for reading, I can only hope that someone can take away any small benefit from this, i wrote this primarily for myself but i'd also like to give back and help others; I think that's a key component in maintaining my sobriety. I've always loved helping others, now it's time to learn how to truly help myself. All the best everyone, we can do this.",8,0

This is my second day without weed, I‚Äôve been smoking HEAVILY for the past 4 years. I‚Äôve also been working on cannabis farms in that time frame and smoking has always just been acceptable (and almost encouraged) so it become a very heavy habit for me. I already suffered from heavy anxiety/depression before I started smoking at 19 and it really helped me alleviate those symptoms. I was more social, outgoing, and relaxed about most things.

Today is the first day, free from Her Grip","Hello, I have been a regular smoker for 7 years now, past 4 years a Heavy user. I remember when MJ used to bring me happiness and just a great release. In 2015 I had to make the decision as an only child to unplug my father.  Enter the different MJ, I was using her to cover my emotions, cover up the pain... cover up the conversations... Cover up everything that was remotely painful. I was even stoned motioning through his service... This has continued steadily since his passing.. Well I‚Äôm tired of feeling lost in my own head, going through the motions just to feel nothing with my next bowl... Now fast forward to 2020 and I have had my eyes opened. She makes me numb to my boys, numb to my fianc√©e and her feelings. It is time to work on me and my own sanity... So I bid her farewell!! It‚Äôs just not worth it anymore!

I‚Äôm glad I found this place I have been lurking and reading others experiences and I never realized it was MJ I thought it was myself that was broken.

I‚Äôll be picking up my old hobbies to keep me busy, gardening, model building, just plain ole making memories with my family.

Any advice is welcome... I‚Äôll need some new Sober friends.. My currents friends with the exception of my Best Friend has been negative... So I don‚Äôt really needs those people around me!

I smoked nearly daily for 10 years, ages 19 - 29, smoking at least an oz a week, mostly spliffs. I'm still having a drink about once a week, but thinking about stopping entirely as it doesn't seem to actually relax me or bring me anything useful. Im still vaping nicotine, I find it really helps when Im having a craving and helped replace my nighttime ritual of smoking 2 - 3 spliffs. I have a goal of stopping nicotine eventually, but not trying to push myself too hard. 

The first week was really rough, tons of anger, anxiety, insomnia, no appetite. 2nd and 3rd week all these symptoms slowly got better, and brain fog really went away at the beginning of this 3rd week.  Now my appetite has fully returned and my mood much more even, still a bit of anxiety and having a hard time putting down the phone and going to bed at a reasonable time, but I can fall asleep pretty easily. 

Today I woke up with bad brain fog, almost as if I'd smoked the night before or taken a heavy sedative.  It's been like this all day, I exercised, ate well, practiced good self care, but still feeling so sluggish in my thoughts. Anyone else experience this?",3,0

Every time I try to quit, the severe stomach pain always brings me back.

Cannabis was always such an easy way to quickly get rid of my pain. It is also more affordable than most medications you need a prescription for with stomach complications.

I don't want to go back to medicine that won't work, but I also want to quit smoking weed. Getting rid of the stomach pain isn't worth the other problems that have come with my daily use for the last five years.

From a newfound confidence in moderation, and simply not caring about the negative effects of smoking anymore, I relapsed. I bought an eighth, and I told myself that this was my chance to prove to myself that I can moderate and weed can still be apart of routine. I'm sure you can see where this is going. I smoked that night and I instantly remembered why I was so hooked from the start, as my tolerance had significantly lowered over the month, and I got zooted. I did manage to not smoke the next day, barley, but even despite that slight bit of ""moderation,"" smoking was on my mind 24/7.

Of course, this moderation only lasted that day, and I proceeded to smoke everyday after that. I had originally planned to smoke through the eighth and then quit again, but yesterday I threw out what remained of my stash, because I've finally realized the utter misery it brings on my life. Later on in my binge I began smoker earlier and earlier in the day, and I can finally see how unfulfilling this lifestyle is. My day would consist of pushing back smoking as far as i could manage, smoking, coming down, smoking, going to bed, and eating an ungodly amount of food the whole time. I didn't want my parents to see me high, so I stayed isolated. All of my friends know I've been working on quitting weed, so I didn't want to see any of them because I was ashamed. My life consisted of trying to fill complete and utter boredom any form of media/food/lazy ass shit I could. Truly miserable.

While I was confident in the beginning of my sobriety, my faith and effort began to wean, as I began to forget the life I was leaving behind. It turns out the ""life"" I left behind was really just a drug fueled binge to have an excuse to not care, to be lazy, to be unmotivated. Even a one month break was enough to show me the the half-life I was living while smoking everyday.

For anyone considering quitting: Addiction is literally **the** hardest thing to face and accept and even harder to fully beat (if even possible), its a battle with your own willpower that I feel I haven't won yet, with weed or any of my other bad habits. I greatly recommend going sober just for a period of time at least. Use this time to invest in yourself and your mental health, your hobbies and passions, your relationships, because just quitting and trying not to go back is never enough. Living a productive sober life gives you reasons to not want to go back, and mentality is the key aspect in fighting addiction. Relapse is okay, for me it was the catalyst of a newfound craving for sobriety and stability in my life, but be careful not to fall back into the same mental tricks leading to the same habits.

Sorry this post was a bit long and rambling, I needed to get this off my chest, and hopefully it helps one of you who need it right now. Hang in there everyone, it gets better. <3",10,0

I had a few breaks here and there, but only due to lack of availability and not some attempt at quitting. I wrote a wall of text here because I really enjoy reading longer stories from people rather than just a sentence or two.

When I discovered weed, it was like I discovered the thing that made me whole. People that know me think I'm dark, depressed, and angry. Weed made me relax, feel good, and laugh. God I remember I would laugh so hard, I would be doubled over for minutes. I can recall my abs being sore on several occasions the day after these laughing fits. My favorite thing to do was to watch old episodes of Cosmos with Carl Sagan and other science shows and just be enthralled with learning and visualizing. It was intensely pleasurable and kept me coming back and interested for a long time.

But that was a long time ago. Years ago even. Marijuana for me now is not the same thing it used to be. I don't get any more laughing fits nor am I endlessly fascinated by science shows. It seems to me that I've been chasing those old feelings with ever increasing amounts of weed and I'm at the point where I know I will never be there again.

Earlier this year, I stopped using. The pandemic obliterated my daily routine so old habit cues were lost and I didn't think about or crave weed at all.

It took 90 days until the voice in my head started: ""Memorial Day is coming up, why not get just enough for the weekend? You don't leave the house anyways."" Originally, the plan was to buy an eighth and use it all up over the 3 day weekend. I normally buy an ounce at a time, but I really didn't want to get right back into it. However, when it was time to purchase, I got half an ounce which I knew I wasn't going to finish by the end of the long weekend.

So what came out of my half ounce relapse? I gained 10 pounds due to overeating and laziness. I still attempted to exercise, but weed makes me feel like my muscles are completely dead. My lungs also seem like it's harder to take in oxygen further exacerbating my laziness. I also feel like I have no memories of the past couple of weeks.

Today is day 5 for me. Like a lot of you, I'm at the point where I don't even like weed anymore. My first high after 90 days lasted maybe 30 minutes and then it was like I had never quit. I was just back in it. I was high first thing in the morning like clockwork and kept going all day until the night when I couldn't even keep my eyes open any longer. It disgusts me to think that I crave this substance that causes me to nod off in front of my computer like I'm a narcoleptic or something.

This time is different for me. During one of my hazes, I threw away all of my gear except for one piece. Here's what I threw away: Arizer Extreme Q, Ditanium, a bong, 2 Magic Flight Launch Boxes, and a Pax. With accessories, it comes to over $1000 I tossed in the trash. There is this feeling of guilt I have that all of my gear is forever bundled together in a black plastic bag calling to me and will be pushed further and further down into the earth over time by mountains of garbage that our society generates. My personal time capsule of shame.

I'm in my day 3 of quitting with significantly tapering before. 

I'm feeling so many things currently that I haven't felt in my lifetime. I don't know how this journey's gonna pan out, but I'm trying to be positive as much as possible. I already had two ER visits due to being hypochondriac about the mental fog with some bowel issues, but at least now I know that my blood, urine, and heart is normal (Yayy for that).

The weirdest thing I felt that I wanted to ask you guys was I suffered a sudden drop of tolerance and even a pinchful of weed was making me paranoid. This happened after 2.5 years of smoking and then tapering to 4 hits a day for a week, then 3 hits a day for a week and then  BOOM my tolerance kinda reset making me paranoid even on the tiniest amount smoked. I talked about this to my doc and he said that your body is kinda done with THC and is telling you to stop (lucky me I actually had that planned in my mind).

As I'm typing this I currently feel mental fog, sweaty palms, appetite could be worse but I'm managing that with juices, smoothies, and chicken broth, trying to add solid foods slowly to curb diarrhea . I also plan on taking help from psychologists for the anxiety and the possibility of having ADHD.

I've been lurking here for 4 months now and I want to thank all of you for your informative posts. It really helps to connect with other people. I guess as a human being we are wired to be social but smoking for 2.5 years now I guess I have become antisocial (I'm pretty sure I've) .

Today is day 32 since I freed myself from weed. The first week was pretty damn rough, and I used 2-3 drinks each night to help myself sleep and satisfy my mind's need to get fucked up. The second week was much better physically, but it didn't get any better when it came to urges.

Day after day it got a little bit easier. A couple weeks in and I cut the alcohol to a couple times per week (which I think is reasonable, since I only have a couple beers anyway, and I never liked alcohol enough for it to become a vice for me.)

 About three weeks in I had a friend who was in the area and asked me if I wanted to smoke after going to a local protest with him. I declined, but mainly on the basis that I didn't want to risk exposing my family, newly-born nephew, and grandparents to COVID.

Flash-forward to yesterday, and I had an old, really good friend that I hadn't seen in a couple years who was helping his family move into the area. I offered to help, and he came by my house so I could follow him to the house we were headed to. When he opened his car doors that familiar smell presented itself, and I became slightly uneasy about the process. But he wasn't going to be in town for more than a day or two (just to help them move in), so I followed him.

After a few hours of grueling work moving furniture up the stairs over and over, we took a break. I watched him roll a dank blunt just a few feet away from me for a few minutes. After he finished, he asked me:

""Would you like to partake?"" seemingly already knowing the answer. And on the car ride over, I had thought about it, and I came to the conclusion that if I were going to smoke, this would be a time where it wouldn't be blameworthy. We loved to smoke, myself and a couple friends were what opened him to the stoner lifestyle in the first year of college. I hadn't seen the dude for a 20+ months, we were both tired, and I had always kept the thought in my mind that, after a while, smoking on special occasions would be fine.

But I didn't want to smoke, so I didn't smoke.

 The smell was tempting, but everything else -- the cloudy-headed feeling, the anxiety I knew I would have when I'd drive home baked as hell after a month-long break, the coughing, the awkwardness -- didn't appeal to me. It was at that point that I realized I was done with weed. For good. I'm not going to say that it won't be difficult not to partake at times in the future, but I feel confident that, although it was *so much* fun for a few years, that chapter of my life is over. My friend was surprised, but he didn't take any offense. He's a good guy.

I was pretty proud of myself after that, and this community has been my main source of accountability and help during my recovery. So I thought it apt so share my story with y'all in hopes that those of you who are struggling would gain a little bit of strength from my experience.

Cravings are still there but not nearly as bad. It's getting better.  I think about weed much less. Some times the thought of weed even disgusts me. 

I feel much, much better emotionally, physically, and mentally than before. The difference is very noticeable. 

Back when I was a child / teen I thought I was one of the smart kids but then over time (I started smoking when I was 14) it became harder to learn, focus and memorize.  I still went to a top 50 college and business school but I knew I was not performing to my potential.  

It was because of the fucking weed.

This last week I started getting back into piano playing and even picked up programming through Codecademy. I noticed it was much easier to focus and learn new things. It would not be possible if I was high.

What is keeping me sober and preventing me relapsing is this feeling of sobriety that is way better than any smoke. I don't want to lose this feeling. And I know weed has prevented my past self from reaching the places my present self could be at today.  

Sobriety feels good. And makes you realize how much life you wasted due to weed. 

But it hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows. I think I have an addictive personality and playing a little too much video games and over eating.  I've lost 35lbs in the last 2 years and even did a marathon earlier this year (I loved running while high) but due to an unexpected health scare and week long hospital visit I am not allowed vigorous exercise for another 7 weeks (I'm 8 weeks in to this no exercise shit). 

Those are separate issues I'll have to come to terms with but the focus now is killing the weed habit once and for all. 

Already looking forward to my week 4 post.

Desperate to quit for years. Pre-existing mental health issues made this extremely difficult. Here‚Äôs my personal timeline: 

January
-Stopped smoking after entering a relationship. She didn‚Äôt like smoking at all so even cigs got kicked. Things going well, had some great times together and she motivated me to stay clean. 

-soon replaced my smoking habit with Valium (diazepam) naively thinking that I‚Äôd wean myself off slowly. Taking 20/30mg a day. Massive help for anxiety and sleep, the two biggest triggers for me relapsing with weed. Had abused on and off over years when available but never experienced any WD. 

February
-Valium drys up. Forced to abruptly jump off of 30mg a day after a good month and a half binge. Planned on tapering off slowly, but couldn‚Äôt find any anywhere. Wasn‚Äôt too worried however as I‚Äôd been through opiate WD so thought I knew what to expect. Damn I was wrong.

-Broke up with Gf after I started to see her as being very emotionally manipulative. Started smoking weed again to cope with stress 

-Went into Benzo WD 3 days after last dose. Didn‚Äôt realise. Attributed feelings to end of relationship and subsequent stress of uni, and guilt of starting up smoking again. During this period tried abstaining from weed again, however the intense anxiety, dread and insomnia caused by the benzos made this impossible, fell into very deep depression. 

-2 weeks later went to stop with family to stay sober. Incredibly difficult but managed a good month. 

March
-lockdown prevented me from using my sobriety tactics (going to uni, meeting with friends, skating etc.) 

-started smoking again after returning to work. Dealer lives on walk back home so temptation is high, convinced myself I could moderate to just at night after work. Turned into weeklong binge. As always. 

April
-Valium resurfaces. I buy 300mg to help me kick the weed again. End up going through it in a few weeks. Last dose was 100mg, which I had saved aside to taper. Cannot even remember why I decided to take so much. Dealer goes dry again.

-spend next two weeks in WD again, cold turkey. Pure hell, much worse than last time as I had no weed to help. Still didn‚Äôt attribute it to benzos, thought was very brutal weed WD.

May
-few weeks later, bought more Valium. Binged again for few weeks. Still feeling very low

-took ketamine to try and help with depression as it‚Äôs had a profound benefit in the past. Unfortunately, it made me much worse, possibly due to having the Valium during the experience. Basically blacked out and couldn‚Äôt remember any of it.

-coming out of the ketamine haze, felt overwhelming sense of hopelessness and trapped by my addictions. Tried to kill myself by taking rest of Valium (150mg), rest of my pregabalin script (7+ gs) and washed it all down with ton of booze. 

-End up hospitalised. Almost sectioned after trying to escape ward to have a cig. Spend two days there then return home.

-Picked up more Valium as I knew WD‚Äôs were very likely. Made conscious effort to take only to prevent this as opposed to recreational use. Soon started taking it to get high again. Smoking weed again during this time.

-After educating myself on dangers of long term benzo use, decided to stop. Terrified myself at prospect of damage to my brain. Jumped off at 30mg again. Had plenty to taper off, however wanted to kick it soon as possible instead of a slow taper. Very stupid idea, but became so scared to even take one more

-Nightmare. Even with weed, this time was infinitely worse. Came very close to killing myself. Would not have survived fully sober. Insomnia, restlessness, hallucinations, intensely anxious and depressed, very lucky not to have a seizure.

June
-Wds pass after two weeks. Weed consumption at all time high but relieved to be over that hellish time. 

Now attempting to kick the weed. On Day 3, and comparatively this time is much easier. Still sucks and going through typical weed Wd but feel better equipped to deal with it. First two days were very positive, today I‚Äôm struggling. Not because I want to smoke, just uncomfortable body sensations and general anxiety, which I know will pass. 

Long story short, don‚Äôt try and kick a generally benign addiction with a more hardcore one. Curing drug addiction with drugs is like trying to fix a broken arm by breaking the other arm so the pain of the first break doesn‚Äôt hurt as bad. It‚Äôs counterproductive and doesn‚Äôt break the cycle. 

TLDR: used Valium to kick weed. Used weed to kick Valium. Rinse and repeat.",3,1

Some people recommended Grounded App, but for me it wasn't motivating. I had weed almost for free, so counting money I saved just makes me laugh and I don't have a problem with counting the days sober by myself.

I really kind of changed attitude towards weed this time. I decided that this chapter of My Life is over and I have to to focus on healing my life. I also feel like I am Not missing anything Not Smoking Weed and I just accepted the fact that I am an addict. And I just stopped having cravings or thinking about how Bad the life will be without weed or what I miss. 

But that is when things started to be overwhelming. Like I noticed how many things I have to change. How immature emotionally I can be. How chaotic is the life I have, with or without weed. Kind of like, when I was sober last time for 4 months I skipped the part of truly improving, because I was still thinking about weed. Sure, My Life was better during that 4 months, but although sober, I still was thinking like an addict and I wasn't able to face my flaws.

And I feel like lost. I lost trust to my therapist, as she kind of encouraged me to try to moderate weed, although she knew I was heavy smoker and what a mess I was becoming because of this habit.
I don't have however strength now to just read books and create recovery plan for myself, so I was amazed to find this Sanvello app that uses CBT, keeps Tracking My mood, helps creating healthy habits, setting goals. This app premium Version is free now, because of covid.

Today I woke up with high anxiety and I entered my mood and I started the Journey there to feel better. In 1 hour my mood changed, like I was guided through Meditation, I was guided to find out how am I Feeling and where these feelings are in my body. If I was left alone with that hopelessness I would be struggling with the mood for next few hours. I never learnt healthy Coping Mechanisms or I was able to use them for few days or week and then I was drifting to my unhealthy patterns. I need this guidance now, I need daily reminders and I need the help with that, so I find this app really amazing.

So if you struggle with living healthy in some areas of your life I would recommend it.",6,1

I've had some professional help as well but I didn't stick with it and got addicted soon after again. So now I've been quitting for about 2 months again, and only smoked twice. One of wich was yesterday.

Every time I smoke, I get these brutally honest negative thoughts in my head and they don't seem to stop. Thoughts like I ruined my life, I have no friends, I'm a loser. Then anxiety comes around the corner. Bad social anxiety, like going outside is not an option. But even turning the music down, because I feel like my bloody neighbors, which I actually never talk to, are judging my music taste. I just turn in this big anxious mess when I smoke.

I really needed to type this out, so I can read it whenever I want to smoke again. Man it sucks. After all those years smoking from a young age, my mind still thinks sometimes it's the only way to feel good. Even though I know it will do me harm, I still smoke. It's like my own mind is playing tricks with me and has done that for years.

I'm 25 years old now and I'm on anti depressants for the second time. Lost most of my friends because I've been isolating myself for months on end.

Well I'm quitting for good again this time. Sorry for the rant and bad English. Wish me luck.",11,0

Weed withdrawal 

(29m) ~ 4 years of nightly smoking with heavy binges on weekends (I‚Äôll skip the long back story this time).... Back again... felt a string on the symptoms would help clarify for others. I‚Äôve decided to stop again, decided to wean off this time. 
Symptoms I‚Äôve experienced:

1. Cluster headaches (kinda) kinda feels like small zaps all over my head, not too painful but noticeable.  Get a weird pressure/pain on the top of my head and back of my eyes (most prevalent) 

Edit: apparently they‚Äôre known as brain zaps, common withdrawal symptoms for other drugs, haven‚Äôt found much relating to MJ  withdrawals. 

2. Anxiety/panics: only when i went straight cold turkey, this time I‚Äôm weaning so now i just feel a weird discomfort, most likely my ‚Äúreward system‚Äù trying to rebalance. Mostly at night when trying to sleep, often wake up feeling like shit

3. Stomach is super sensitive, greasy foods are a definite no go. 

4. Flat demeanor 

5. Tired but somehow more productive

6. Occasional night sweats. When i tried cold turkey i had to change clothes at least once a night, huge wet spot on the sheets too.  

7. Occasional nightmares

Almost two weeks in:

8. Annoying muscle twitch/spasms all over

.... all i can remember, I‚Äôll add as I go

7/16: over a month in most withdrawal symptoms are gone even the headaches. Still twitch a bit especially with caffeine",2,0

I'm only 24 (well, 24 next Saturday!). 

I started cutting down my usage at the begining of March, smoking once a week or so, as opposed to all to all day every day.

Then I started seeing my new girlfriend, and she said that while she really liked me, she couldn't be with someone who got stoned all the time. I was open with my struggles with weed. And she has been very supportive. 

I'm undecided as to whether I wanna smoke again or not, but only in a social setting. For now, I'm just happy having quit. I want to get to two months, then see where I get.

Things I've noticed;

My mental health is a hell of a lot better. I have issues with severe depression and anxiety, and I don't want to kill myself as much anymore. 

I'm proactive, I get stuff done. Chores arent an issue. Working out isnt an issue. Nothing is an issue at all in terms of being a functional adult.

I enjoy having drinks with friends, and not needing a cone (bowl) to feel social.

I'm more at ease with being myself, and being assertive with people, and when I feel uncomfortable.

I've made more friends, I've opened my life up.

My mind is working again. My memory is improving.

I've finally learnt what being happy means.


I'm not struggling. Now I just need to get a part time job sorted, so I can continue to support myself when I go back to Uni next year.

Oh yeah, probably my biggest positive, I'm thinking long term again, I'm making goals and plans for my future.

I‚Äôm (24F) really struggling with my bf (30M) who uses daily. We don‚Äôt even live together and aren‚Äôt seeing each other in person on a regular basis. But since I first quit I made it clear to him that it was a difficult task for me and explained how I‚Äôm fine with him smoking but to not bring it up to me bc that makes me crave it and fixate on it. Meanwhile since then he‚Äôs brought weed up over and over on the phone many times. At first he would ask me if I needed any/wanted him to drop some off to me. I kept explaining thanks but no thanks, and to pls quit asking bc we‚Äôve talked about this already and me quitting. He continued to smoke while we were on the phone together (he‚Äôs very loud and makes obvious noises with him clearing ash out of his piece and using a lighter and loud inhales and coughing - really over the top). So I asked him not to smoke on the phone with me bc I can tell when he does and it gives me really bad cravings. He agreed but has continued to do so. He has also brought up THC pens and bragged how now he could smoke on the phone without me knowing. This upset me greatly but I held my tongue and dealt with it. To clarify, I‚Äôve explained to him that I‚Äôm fine with him smoking but I‚Äôd prefer he not do so while on the phone with me bc it makes me crave it. We usually only talk on the phone for 5-10min at a time, 0-2 times a day. so it really should not be that much of an inconvenience for him to wait ten minutes before getting high. 

Well today we were on the phone and he was clearly smoking (very loudly) and then said ‚Äúyou probably don‚Äôt want to hear this, but I‚Äôve got the best bud from my dealer‚Äù. I got really upset with him and told him not to talk to me about that. He got defensive but eventually said okay and We ended the phone call shortly after that.

I‚Äôm really at my wits end here and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve made it abundantly clear on many occasions that I don‚Äôt want to hear anything about weed from him, yet he continues to bring it up to me and essentially brag about it or rub it in my face. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm asking too much. I don‚Äôt mind him smoking bc what he does is his business - I just don‚Äôt want him to do it while on the phone with me or mention it to me bc I‚Äôm struggling to quit. I‚Äôm just not in the place where I can hear him smoking or talk about weed yet. Idk what to do from here. It seems like he has no respect for my requests or feelings. It‚Äôs making me question his character as a person honestly. I don‚Äôt want to overreact, but this feels like a blatant disregard of my emotions. I‚Äôve been very supportive of him trying to quit cigarettes and don‚Äôt bring them up bc I know it would trigger him, and I‚Äôve even mentioned that as an example and he agreed him bringing weed up to me was harsh, but that was weeks ago and he continues to do so. It feels like a slap in the face. Is it just me or is this a big red flag? Or am I asking too much of him?

TLDR I quit smoking but my bf still does. I‚Äôm fine with that but asked him not to smoke while on the phone with me or bring up weed to me bc it makes me really crave it. He continues to disregard my wishes and smoke on the phone and bring it up to me on a regular basis. I‚Äôve asked him to stop doing that many many times but he keeps on. It‚Äôs making me rethink his character and this relationship and idk what to do from here, or whether I‚Äôm overreacting",7,0

Today I experienced a lot of sadness and loneliness. But instead of smoking, I Googled, ""what to do if you're lonely"" and followed some good ole internet advice:

1) Name it. Validate it.
Just telling someone you're feeling lonely releases a lot of the stigma and shame about it. First I told my SO. They were sorry but had to work, and didn't have time to do anything. So I texted FIVE friends and told them I was feeling lonely and asked how they were doing. That prompted TWO get together dates being sort of scheduled (my local friends), ONE phone date set for the weekend (from a LD friend living without phone service at her house), and TWO full on text conversations with LD friends which lasted a long time. It was so wonderful to get responses, even if I still struggled w feeling like a burden. I even set up a visit w one friend who moved to the city! Which gives me something to look forward to.

2) Take stock of connections you already have.
I remembered that I was having dinner tonight with a friend I met in Al Anon. Lately (since quitting weed) I've really enjoyed our visits.

3) Recognize you're not alone in feeling lonely.
22% of Americans feel lonely CONSTANTLY. So I'm not a weird failure. I remind myself that loneliness is a healthy emotion that means I want to connect with others.

4) Put your hand over your heart (or other self soothing touches).
This one is weird but I swear it helped when I was crying about feeling lonely. Apparently our bodies react to self soothing the same way we react to other people providing physical comfort: ""Supportive touch works with the person's parasympathetic nervous system, which actually helps calm us down and reduces cortisol and releases oxytocin.""

There were more Google results, but these were the ones I applied today. Feeling really happy that I didn't kill the emotion with weed, but instead felt the emotion deeply and used it as motivation to get myself the social connection I was craving.",32,0

1. Makes me very emotionally unstable on the comedown. A passive aggressive comment from a roommate will have me bawling.
2. Makes me feel guilty since I've been telling people I'm trying to quit and then doing it behind their backs.
3. Makes me less articulate. I even had to google for the word 'articulate'
4. Makes me sleep poorly.
5. Makes me impulsive.
6. Damages my lungs.
7. Inhibits my ability to study. I'm trying to study algorithms for job interviews and it really requires strong short term memory
8. Makes me feel like an addict. I go through periods where I can't stop thinking about how to get high.
9. Makes me compensate for depression and not get at the root issues.
10. Makes me feel like a hypocrite for judging my stoner roommate and then sneaking it in myself.

Am in lockdown currently, and my weed use was up for the first 2-3 weeks; I went from nighttime smoking after dinner to wake and bake. Then I realized how addicted I was and I managed to take a break for 9 days. But that was 2 weeks ago and now I am back to smoking after dinner everyday, one pinner, and its medium strength weed.

The first day smoking after the 9 day break, I woke up after that and didn't get the brain-fog at all. I was like '!!!! I'm not hungover, I'm cured!!!'. Then I smoked that night and the next day I had a little brain-fog, but not bad at all so I brushed it off. Well, you could have guessed, I kept smoking every night and now I'm getting the brain-fog everyday when I wake up, and it lasts for 4-6 hours after I wake up (from just one pinner). I am not getting that stoned, and the brain fog just weed kicking my ass way after the fact. 

My current excuse is the 'sleep remedy' excuse. But even I am starting to disbelieve again. I don't want this brain-fog, I want to use my brain, not inundate it with weed to make the fog go away (but I think weed just makes my brain dumb and feel not foggy even though it is).

I had two best friends at that time, they usually didn‚Äôt have money so would always hang out with me because I always had weed. Plus, we could all smoke inside my house. 

One of them I fell out with after some years, but the other we stayed friends. 

I was trying to quit for the past 4 years (finally made it to 10 months right now) so our friendship got more distant as I wasn‚Äôt hanging out to smoke. We still spoke about music from time to time. 

Last month, he asked me if I want to buy some drugs. I just replied ‚Äònot my lifestyle anymore man‚Äô. Through our years of friendship I knew he was battling serious depression and near constant thoughts of suicide. He seemed happier as we got older so last month I assumed he was fine. 

Today was his funeral. He committed suicide. I have no doubt the weed exacerbated this because it was fuelling my own depression for all the years I smoked it. 

When you are stuck in the loop of addiction you never deal with your real emotions. It can make you feel emotions that you wouldn‚Äôt be feeling otherwise. Wake up groggy head > can‚Äôt smoke bad mood > something happens irritated > smoke to feel better and forget > never deal with your emotions properly > get depressed because you‚Äôre stuck in this loop. You tell yourself you can‚Äôt live without it because it‚Äôs the only way to feel relaxed, to feel happy, to deal with your pain. And all your friends are doing it, everyone says it‚Äôs good for your health, oh and you can‚Äôt get addicted to weed. It‚Äôs a natural plant. Blah blah

I arrive there and the first thing I smell, from a distance away, is his dealers smoking holding a baby in their arms. No one talks to me anymore so I kept my distance anyway. 

These people can‚Äôt see they enabled his depression and now all those closest to him, who made fun of him for years, are standing at his funeral smoking weed.

I was in bad shape, in a relationship that wasn't making me happy, high all day, and dropped out of uni.

I don't blame weed or anything else, just myself. I've used it to cope hard things in life. I've always been a bit lazy, socially anxious and with low self-esteem, so I was basically designed to let weed becoming the purpose of my life. It made me isolate in my cynical and edgy headspace, it destroyed the little motivation I had, it made me feel ok not going out there and getting new relationships and experiencing new things life have to offer.

2 years ago I quitted for 3 months, went back to school, left my gf and started working out. Since then I had highs and lows, slowly getting better but in a couple moments I also reached low points I didn't reach even before that realization.

One of this low point was in January. I fully opened up with my mother for the first time, she was really supportive, and I decided to get therapy, even though I never started because of the pandemic. However, I then went 4 months without getting high, my longest streak since the first time I smoked. I was really sure that I was done with it for good. The pandemic even helped me because my habit loop changed, I didn't see my friends as much, and I wasn't put in situation that scares me or makes me uncomfortable. Not having to go out and see people, not feeling bad about the fact that I can't push myself to talk to girls, not having to go to class and feeling lonely and anxious because I can't talk to people like I would like to, and the exams was far in the future.

Then the quarantine ended. The exams were behind the corner and I started getting reeeeeally anxious, and that made procrastinate, which made the anxiety worse. Also, I started going out a little and I started drinking a bit too much. One night in a bar I saw a girl I have a crush on (yeah, I used that word at 24, guess I'm emotionally immature, but it feels like it) that I texted a bit in quarantine but I barely spoke to her in person and couldn't make a move. That really made me depressed and feeling worthless. A week later I met another girl I didn't knew, who was clearly into me and somehow I managed to ask her out (I think that's the third time in my life I managed to do that): it went actually well, but the whole situation was too much, too real for me to handle, my anxiety went through the roof, and it affected my study. Also I was feeling bad for not having the courage to ask out the other girl and having ""settled"" for this one. I mean, she's nice and I'm actually interested in her, bit deep down I knew I did that because was easier and not because I really wanted it.

After all that, a week ago, I was hanging out with a friend who was basically my main smoking buddy all these years. I haven't had cravings in 3 months, I didn't even thought about smoking even though I was so overwhelmed by everything, but as soon as he told me ""I think I'll roll a joint"" I immediately told him that I wanted to smoke with him ""just once"".

I went to bed really high, sure that I would wake up sad and disappointed with myself. And what scares me the most is that I didn't. I woke up feeling good, relieved of all the the anxieties I had the last few weeks. And I just sat down and begun to study. I know why that happened: weed has been for years my way to cope with anxiety and bad feelings, and I still haven't properly learned another healthy way to do that. So of course I felt relieved. It doesn't mean that I should start smoking weed again...

...but, the cravings are back. I can't stop obsessing and rationalizing about weed, wether I should use it in moderation or not. I fucking hate that I can't just smoke once in a while like a lot of people do. I hate that smoking it's the only way of living I know. I feel like I am back at the start again.",9,5

And my motivation has gone through the floor. I am an entrepreneur. And this does not work with the lack of any motivation. I can't keep clients happy like this.  


But a few days ago I realized that this is beyond just lazyness or lack of motivation. I feel like I check many of the ""depression"" checkboxes. And I never thought I would be one to admit (to myself) that this could be the case.  


This combined with a bad habit of keeping up with the world news. And they have been depressing lately. The stuff going on in the US (even though I am in no way related to anything going on over there) and the whole COVID situation. All this combined has gotten me to the point where I realize I have depression. Hopefully a mild, weed-caused, case.  


Nontheless - I don't want to be this way.  


Reading many of the posts here I see that many of you still have residue anxiety and constant boredom after months. Here I am wondering - if I have been a smoker for only half a year in a row - would I still be going through these feelings after multiple months or years even?  


This answer won't change the fact that I understand that I am not just a recreational user, but an addict. Hell, even writing this last sentence is... therapeutic?  


So here goes day 1.  
I need to find substitute serotonin sources. As I have been smoking every evening. I started this as it seemed to help me with my sleeping problems (restless sleep and whatnot) - and when I started smoking, my sleeping became more of quality and all that.  


I excercise - I work out at home with weights (still kinda afraid/worried about going to the gym because of the virus). But other than that, I am not sure what hobbies I should pick up or continue.  


I have miniature painting which I love - maybe I should, start doing that every (most) nights instead.  


Also, a question, if you can tell me (again, I think what my approach here will be, but it is worth asking) - would easing off make it easier - As in, keep the habit for a while, but use less and less weed in my joints every night.  
(Oh, worth a mention, that since weed is not that easy to come by (and is somewhat expensive) here, the amounts I use per joint are very small. I am talking about (a very rough estimate) 0.1 grams per joint, perhaps even less))  


I just want to make sure I don't relapse and keep this train going in the right direction. However I can make it easier on me.",2,2

Our days together were so fun and shiny and I'm glad we shared them. I'll see you again from time to time, but only to listen to really important albums, if I feel like it. 

I wish I could smoke you like I used to, especially during quarantine. However, that ""weed isn't as fun anymore"" switch in my brain, that I never thought would flip, has flipped. I hate that that's the case, but I guess it happens to a lot of people. Now you just freak me out a lot of the time. 

Thanks for being there when I woke up, right on my sunny bedside table, making my shower and Dunkin' Donuts run feel like an anime sequence. Thanks for helping me meet so many of my introverted friends at parties. Thanks for not being alcohol! 

Thanks for the way you make music sound so beautiful. Thanks for that crazy pair of earmuffs and glasses that always overlay awe. 

Thanks for showing my ADD brain how pretty the world can be when I calm down and live in the moment. For showing me how fun and lovely it can be to sing and dance and talk to my cats while cooking dinner, without getting lost in my head. 

It feels weird to be the only person in my house who does not want to smoke weed, when for the past three years I've internalized smoking weed as the meaning of life to some degree. 

I adored seeing myself as a \~girl who smokes weed\~ instead of a \~girl who spends too much time alone\~ but those two things are the same at the end of the day, I guess. The illusion is up!

I'll bring you to parties once they're a thing again, probably. And definitely a few concerts. But as for craving you to shower, as if it will wrap me in a warm cartoon puff of steam and strawberry conditioner rather than utter disappointment, I'm done with that for the most part. I don't crave what you do to me now, I crave the way you felt five years ago. That was my warm welcome, and I overstayed it. Especially when I spent more time high than sober. 

The long megalopolis redeye highway rides watching stars fly by from the cool air of a Megabus, with my dab pen in my big jean jacket pocket, vaping, exhaling into my backpack, and hearing all my favorite songs in the world for the first time ever, over and over again, in complete bliss and awe as I stared wide-eyed out the window. Waiting at the bus terminal, eating McDonalds, waiting for those quiet dark hours after midnight. The times you spent with me and the way you made music sound were more moving than any classical music symphony I have ever imagined\*. We ran across the stars together and ice-skated around the country. Thank you beyond words for that.

I'm getting sappy, but this is a throwaway. Thank you weed for being part of my young adult life. I wouldn't have had it any other way. 

But now I'm going to take the lessons you taught me, 

and actually get off my ass and use them now...

I've been diagnosed with ADHD just half a year ago and it explains a lot of things: not being able to clear up after i worked in the workshop of my father, because my batteries were empty. Not being able to learn in school properly but being A+ in the school itself I can go on but you get an idea. 

After first smoking weed I got the usual high, munchies etc but once I moved out I smoked on a daily basis and it helped a lot. I could stay on a project 8hrs at a time without distraction. I could listen to my girlfriend for 20mins without interrupting her once and I had no problem going to sleep. 

Now after 4 yrs I've had enough, the bad side effects turned on me, sleeping was as bad as it ever was if I didn't smoke a few grams that evening, I would eat less so I had money for weed and bailed on friends so I could go home and smoke. I tried to quit at least a dozen times in the past few years but only a maximum of 3 days before I gave in.
Now I've just finished my second week without smoking and I'm quite proud but my feelings keep getting worse from day to day. Every guide says do something, sports, friends, cooking. I do all that stuff, I've been doing it while I was smoking as well but now the second I drive home from training or finish eating I'm down. Its a mix of lethargy and depression and my concentration is at an all time low. Can't even watch an episode of whatever show for more than 2 minutes without swapping tabs and looking for something new to buy or a new project even though I didn't even start the other 5 things I had in mind. 

I know the basic neurological ideas and know that it should get better, I tried to find a therapist but I live in a town which uni destroys people on a daily basis so wait time for therapy is 4 months. 

I tried ADHD prescription drugs but they rob all my focus and being dependent on the next substance is a horror for me seeing how hard it is to quit weed. 

So if you've gone through something similar please help me, even a book or something would be useful for me. Till then I stay strong, try to manage my thoughts and treat my body as good as I can.

My name is Sebastian I am 19 years old and Im an addict. 

It all started in junior year of high school when I started smoking. the first time i actually got high was from my dads dab pen and I don‚Äôt really know how to describe it but it was like for the first time ever I felt like I was comfortable and had no worries. 

I looked at this as an escape, and didn‚Äôt really think about being addicted or even having a problem for almost 2 years. My dad always told me he‚Äôs had addiction problems and has been to rehab twice for alchohal abuse. I never really believed him (I shouldve). And look what happened 

I kept chasing the dragon over and over again and it just ended with me not even getting high anymore and having anxiety when I‚Äôm sober or in need of it.

Heavy usage after a long period of time also caused me to have social anxiety, not want to do anything in life, no motivation, racing thoughts, etc. I never want to go back to living like this again. 

Hopefully some can relate

The last 4 years were especially heavy use without a day off from it that I can remember. The first few days of the quit were rough with the insomnia and lack of appetite that is so common. That said after 4 or 5 days I was feeling much better and knew I was doing the right thing. At about the 2 week point I started having some issues with my temper and it has only gotten worse since. I get mad about the stupidest things and insist on arguing and raising my voice. An interesting aspect is that once I stopped using I haven‚Äôt consciously craved it. I live in a legal state and can go out and buy it whenever I want and haven‚Äôt really felt like it. I quit using nicotine 6 weeks before quitting weed and I now am back to having strong cravings for nicotine, especially when feeling anger. It sucks but I am committed to experiencing a sober life and know that 24 days may not be long enough to really see the benefits. It feels like it‚Äôs getting worse though.

Although it was not the most destructive substance I used, it was the first to go and the last to leave.\*

*I've been writing this for over two months so I figured I might as well just post it.*

\------------

Today marks 5 years from my last drink. I don‚Äôt post much on here anymore, but you can dig back through my post history to see some of my earliest posts here if you‚Äôre interested.

I‚Äôm posting today to share my experience, strength, and hope.

Sometimes I just need to hear the truth phrased a particular way for it to make sense and stick with me, even if I‚Äôve essentially heard the very same idea several times before. Maybe I‚Äôll do that for someone here.

WHAT IT WAS LIKE: A portrait of polysubstance abuse, or liking to get high.

Tl;dr I drank, I drugged, I lost.

*‚ÄúBecause if you sit up front and listen hard, all the speakers‚Äô stories of decline and fall and surrender are basically alike, and like your own: fun with the Substance, then very gradually less fun‚Ä¶‚Äù*

I started smoking weed at age 17 and instantly fell in love with it, much in the same way I often hear others describe the deep emotional impact of their first drink. From the first time I got high, it immediately occupied what would become a well worn groove in my mind, even if I wasn‚Äôt a daily smoker right away. It permanently blew open a door I hadn't really been aware of.

By 18 I started smoking alone, which was a change from the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù use that marked my earliest smokes. I loved to get high, walk around, listen to my favorite music, eat junk food, watch porn, watch TV, burrow through the Internet - whatever. I just loved the sensation of being high: the distance it inserted between me and everything else, the pleasure, the perceived insight. My brain was entirely lit up.

My solo usage began after a bad breakup - this became a theme over the years: replacing human relationships and covering up unpleasant emotions with substances. Once I crossed the barrier of getting high alone, getting high most days followed quickly.

I get into a good school, find a fellow stoner, and spend most of my time getting high with him. I drank a bit at this point, always to get drunk, but weed remained my drug of choice. I go home that summer and spend four long months working two jobs and getting high whenever possible (without getting high before work). In addition to my normal sneaking out at night routine, I establish a new system for getting high in the afternoon: a new spot where people can‚Äôt see me, a change of clothes in my car so I don‚Äôt smell like smoke, hand sanitizer in the garage to wash my hands, and so on. The summer gradually becomes quite lonely.

*‚Äú...then eventually a terrible acknowledgement that some line has been undeniably crossed‚Ä¶‚Äù*

At some point in this period, during my ritual nightly high, I had this immense sense of wrongdoing, like I was fucking up my life. It was a mixture of guilt, shame, and self loathing washing over me. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd experienced these emotions before, but on this particular night these feelings all coalesced and weighed down on me. I distinctly recall feeling their weight, seeing them in front of me, and *pushing them way the fuck down.* Fuck off. I am getting high, it is what I do now. This summer, I think, is when I began to internally identify as a drug user.

Fast forward a few years and I‚Äôm getting toward the end of my college career. The brain fog, anxiety, and self loathing are becoming too much. One morning I left my girlfriend sleeping in bed while I packed and smoked a bowl in the living room, masturbating to porn. This was absolutely not the first time I chose artificial sexual intimacy over human intimacy, but after this morning I felt hopeless, disgusted, and resolved to quit smoking weed for a while, which I did, though I continued to sell weed, something I‚Äôd been doing for a few years at this point.

Quitting weed was easy. I did it all the time.

Within a couple weeks I was getting drunk daily. I mostly lived alone that summer and started to drink in the morning, something I hadn‚Äôt really done before.

My girlfriend and I break up and the drinking gets worse. I am peeling myself out of bed in the morning, hungover, and dragging my body to class. I still cared about school and was able to balance what remained. I rarely smoke at this point, sticking with booze instead.

I graduate from college, I get a good job, and the drinking continues - always daily, always to get drunk. I start to really crave a drink during the last few hours of my work day. I start visiting the liquor store on my way home from work so I can start getting drunk in the car. Then I start getting tired of waiting to arrive at the liquor store and start keeping a pint of vodka underneath the driver‚Äôs seat. I don‚Äôt even like vodka that much.

*‚Äú...yes gradually less and less actual fun but with some physical need for the Substance now, instead of the former voluntary fun; then at some point suddenly just very little fun at all, combined with terrible daily hand-trembling need‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Suddenly my future looks like an enormous, flat sheet of asphalt out in front of me. Nothing to see or do, just meaningless distance to traverse and dwindling energy to do so. On the few occasions that I fly somewhere on a plane, I start to passively wish it would crash. I bring nips through security and drink them in the bathroom stalls of the airport and the plane.

I start blacking out more often, peeing on everything, hitting a girl I‚Äôm dating, vomiting on a semi-regular basis, always drinking in the morning (but only on weekends!), showing up hungover and sweaty to work every day.

Emotionally, I am depressed. I feel like my life is over at 24. I am on the rollercoaster of depression and anxiety caused by a combination of hangovers, the chemical effects of alcohol, and a thick sense of shame that I‚Äôm not engaging with life at all in the way that I wanted to.

I tried to convince myself that I was having fun being the guy cracking open beers and drinking vodka out of a brown bag on a Sunday morning bus ride‚Ä¶ but I wasn‚Äôt having fun anymore. I was carved out.

After only about 1.5 years from when I first tried to quit smoking weed, I determine that I need to quit drinking. This isn‚Äôt working. So I put the alcohol down. I started lifting weights more seriously, something that I continually returned to throughout my attempts at sobriety and recovery.

QUITTING DRINKING / STARTING OPIATES / DRINKING AGAIN (!)

Within a few months of quitting drinking I start snorting oxy, then snorting heroin, then the alcohol finds its way back after 7 months off. I was still burying my emotions with substances and not addressing any of the underlying causes. Shame, self loathing, nihilism, and hopelessness swirl around my head.

I string days or weeks of sober time together, but continue to slip back into drinking. The heroin is on/off - I was an amateur chipper, sniffing only.

I start drinking before and during work. I see I‚Äôve lost control. A friend takes me to my first AA meeting at the Shattuck in Jamaica Plain.

After months of Googling \[Am I an alcoholic?\], reading /r/StopDrinking or /r/Leaves, and memorizing the Wikipedia page for Alcoholism, I finally hear stuff that I could identify with on a personal level. The theoretical became relatable. I also kind of got a small glimmer of hope.

*‚Äú...then more Losses, with the Substance seeming like the only consolation against the pain of the mounting Losses, and of course you‚Äôre in Denial about it being the Substance that‚Äôs causing the very Losses it‚Äôs consoling you about‚Ä¶‚Äù*

More drinking. More starts, more stops. I drunkenly tell my dad over the phone that I don‚Äôt know if I can keep living. One day I leave my office at work, pull over my car, and puke behind an elementary school on a Thursday around 5:15 PM.  I cry a little bit at a pizza shop in Harvard Square.

That was my last day of drinking: April 2, 2015.

I start going to a couple meetings per week. I went to a therapist. I read support groups like /r/stopdrinking. By this point the weed is back in full swing, but I didn‚Äôt care. It was way better than drinking. Benzos started to creep in because why not?

My opiate use ebbs and flows through 2015 and into 2016. I get a new therapist. Eventually I choose to get high instead of driving a friend to the hospital. I am, once again, disgusted with myself. I throw out everything: benzos, weed, heroin. I stay clean for about 3 months.

I buy some Opana in October 2016 for a last hurrah and‚Ä¶ it was my last time using opiates after all. Unfortunately this opened up the floodgates for weed and for the next year I play around with amphetamines and benzos. More research and development. I go back to meetings and find one I like in Lexington.

I was able to hold things together for a few months, but soon enough I‚Äôm calling out of work because I‚Äôd spent the whole night all cranked up, sweating so much that my entire room smelled sour.

PUTTING IT ALL DOWN FOR GOOD

I put down the amphetamines in fall 2017 and about a year later I put down the weed too. The benzos fell shortly after that in early 2019. Like the vodka I kept under my car seat, the benzos weren‚Äôt really my trip. They were just around.

That was it for the drugs. Life was exceedingly dull for a few months. My mood was all over the map. I rarely went to meetings at this point, but still saw a therapist. I‚Äôm on my second antidepressant at this point, but in hindsight I have no fucking idea if I ever needed them. I was depressed. I don‚Äôt know what percentage of that state should be attributed to the incessant chemical prodding I‚Äôd been doing since age 17, but it was probably a significant portion.

I should share a strange thing that happened once I started to feel good, emotionally speaking: I was disappointed.  I could no longer use my terrible mood as a ‚Äúgood‚Äù reason for using. I really did feel better without it. This was something I had experienced in increments as I put quit substances over the years. Things always got a bit better before I tried to make things ‚Äúeven better‚Äù with my own chemical tinkering. Now they were good and stayed that way, for the most part.

I don‚Äôt know if I could tell you succinctly what it was all for. Initially it was fun and pleasurable, just the best time I ever had. It was better than everything else. Eventually it started causing more problems than it was solving, shutting doors for me along the way.

Some people have given me credit for all of this quitting and accumulated sobriety. I only deserve a little of it, really. All my life I‚Äôd been looking for an easier, softer way. Eventually that way became sobriety. It was too much work being an active user. So I stopped.

My life has gotten exponentially better as I put more time between myself and drugs/alcohol. I have confidence in myself now. I have energy. I'm more honest. I am capable of caring about things again. I don't want to die anymore.

THINGS THAT HELPED ME

* Going to meetings helped me feel significantly less special. It also gave me a lot of evidence that people do recover and I could recover too. It helped overcome my terminal uniqueness.
* I started lifting weights, eventually getting into powerlifting. I‚Äôve kept up this hobby for about six years now, predating my alcohol abstinence. It‚Äôs been a critical part of my recovery.
* Reading recovery forums, like /r/stopdrinking/, helped me pass the time and give my addict brain reading material as I was sitting around, twiddling my thumbs, crawling up the walls, sweating, and overall just being a miserable sack of bones in the first few months of recovery.
* Take what you need, leave the rest. Obsessing over the efficacy of AA did little to help me stay sober. If you find something helpful, stick with it. Try new things, but don‚Äôt be afraid to drop them. If you have absolutely no trust in your sense of what is helpful or unhelpful, get a sponsor, therapist, or some other third party involved.
* Get okay with the idea that you‚Äôre gonna be uncomfortable for a while. Probably longer than you‚Äôll read online‚Ä¶ because some people probably wouldn‚Äôt attempt sobriety if they knew they had a long, weird year ahead of them. And then another. But this early sobriety time is not all bad. It‚Äôs a little good, a little bad, and mostly foreign.
* Take it easy. Everyone gets sober at the same speed: one day at a time. There is no other speed. You can‚Äôt sniff, smoke, or guzzle sobriety. You can only get it in real time. For me, this was frustrating. I wanted to have a year of sobriety after 1 week. I wanted to get there without doing the work, which was customary of how I approached most everything.

I‚Äôve never been an ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to anything type. Not coffee, alcohol, sex, etc. I never knew why people would feel the need to do a single thing constantly. But I realize I‚Äôm addicted. I need to stop but I don‚Äôt know how.

As to why I smoke, well it seems to make things better. Hard to describe. Music sounds better, video games are more fun to play, feeling the breeze on your skin on a chilly night, and tasting foods all seem way better while high.

And when I think about stopping, I think of how boring life would be. Whenever I‚Äôm not high and I‚Äôm doing something I think to myself ‚Äúthis would be way more fun while high‚Äù And I also thing when I quit that deep down I may always miss it...

I‚Äôm not sure if you guys have also though this way, but if you could share with me some positive things that have been experience by quitting I would like to hear it.

So far the negatives I‚Äôve noticed I would like to get back is just simply the feeling of ‚Äúnot needing weed‚Äù and my memory and mental clarity. I‚Äôm pretty forgetful nowadays and I don‚Äôt have the motivation to do anything at the moment. I hope to hear from you guys. :)",10,0

You find yourself in a vast open prairie on an warm early autumn day just as the sun is about to set behind you.  The grass is no longer green but it is still long and as the sun sets it lights up the grass like glittering gold.  While you feel the wind blowing across your face and smell the earthy autumn air you watch the grass flow like waves before you glistening in that golden hour light.  There is no one else around and though you are all alone in this place, you feel a peaceful presence.  The sun, the wind, the vast sky and fields before you all seem to wrap around you as nature itself holds you in her arms.  You close your eyes and feel the peaceful presence fill your soul.  The rough edges of the day, the week, the year slowly fade and right now you are present in only this moment.  There is no past, there is no future, there is only this moment.

5. It drains my wallet. 
6. It makes me stumble over my words and sound generally less intelligent.
7. It puts me in a bad mood when I'm coming down.
8. It makes me selfish. This isn't the drug's fault, but I am an addict and therefore I prioritize getting high over all else.

I'm from the UK and I started smoking as a teenager and almost instantly became a daily smoker. Some days i may start smoking at 12pm and other days i may not have a joint till 12am, but i would always have at least 1 spliff per day. I have never really gone through vast amounts, an 8th may last me 2 weeks sometimes but i always consumed some every day. With that been said it has never effected me negatively in any way, I'm married to a wonderful women (also a daily smoker), i have my own construction business which I work very hard at, a fantastic social life and a great relationship with my parents. I've travelled to many places all over the world and own a beautiful house and I'm very proud of my accomplishments. 

For the past 6 or so years I've gotten into a habit of going to the pub every day after a hard days work, having 2/3 beers, going home and having a home cooked evening meal with my wife followed by our nightly joint. I realise this is not a healthy lifestyle but its always been a happy one. 

Then in November 2019 my wife found out she was pregnant and we are both over the moon about it. She didn't take another puff of weed and it hasn't bothered her one bit. I continued to smoke and drink daily and this perfect women had never once said a negative comment about it. 

I always had intentions of cleaning up my act towards the end of the pregnancy to become a father, then the covid-19 lockdown happened around 3 months ago and we haven't left the house since. I found myself drinking and smoking weed more, purely out of boredom and still my wife did not moan. 

We are now due to give birth next month and last weekend i drank my last bottle of wine as i smoked my last joint, time to grow up. 

Que the insomnia, nightmares, irritability and something I've never experienced in my life which I can only describe as anxiety. A strange feeling in my stomach and chest that's like I'm about to parachute out of a plane but it sticks around all day. I'm only 5 days in and its not the end of the world, i can handle the withdrawal but I'm worried about the anxiety, i have many friends with anxiety that are on medication and it's something i do not want. I would rather have a life long, mild cannabis addiction than have anxiety for the rest of my life. I'm aware that in America they prescribe medical marijuana for anxiety, not in England however. Does anybody have any experience with developing anxiety after giving up weed? I keep telling myself that once my baby is born it will all disappear but in the back of mind i know thats not true.

I think that feeling like shit is actually a really good thing, it's a way of knowing that I might have some things that I need to deal with.

Many of you'll have gone through the same things.

I've tried to think about something else , but the cravings always get a hold of me. I'm just looking for some help in knocking this habit down and any tips or inspiration videos would be much helpful.

How guilty should I continue to feel?,"Hi r/leaves! I haven't posted before, but I've been a huge fan of this sub. Apologies if I am breaking any rules and for writing such a long, rambly post. I've struggled with marijuana addiction on and off since the first time I lit up(14) and I can't tell you much I appreciate this sub, especially considering that no one understands my addiction nor believes that I could possibly be addicted to marijuana other than my therapist.

A little background about me: I'm a 23 year old male; I'm a motivated(for the most part) recent graduate of a well regarded institution; diagnosed with bipolar 1 after a full blown manic episode at the age of 18 that required hospitalization; just started my first job the week quarantine began funny enough; pretty physically active

Anyway, I first started smoking weed just before I turned 15. After that first bong rip, you could say I was hooked, but I used very moderately and didn't struggle with any sort of addiction. Once I turned 17, I started smoking every night and only found the effects to be positive. Fast forward to my freshman year of college after an incredibly severe and unprecedented depressive episode that no one could understand (it oddly started after a severe bout with mononucleosis), I went manic and eventually was hospitalized and forced to take a semester off. I went to a dual diagnosis clinic and after I was cleared to go back to school, I was told that booze is bad for me and that pot is off limits. I strictly adhered to that for a while, but once I started to get different opinions from different doctors, I figured it was okay for me to partake once in a while, again.

Fast forward to more recent times....After 3 years of no meds or psychiatry, I finally found a psychiatrist who agreed that I was bipolar and who told I am an addict and that all substances are off limits for me. For some reason, being told I was an addict almost made things harder, I almost used it as an excuse. Anyway, I started smoking every night again a bit prior to seeing this psychiatrist, but that fall(my last semester of college) I was heading off to Rome for a semester abroad, where I knew it would be very hard to find weed and thus to give into my nightly impulses. That worked for a while, but the minute I came home and decide to take a bong rip before going to bed, it was back to smoking every night. I recently moved to a new city for a new job, and I figured that would be the perfect impetus for quitting, but because I literally started the job from home and because the job hasn't been at all demanding, I've once again fallen into the nightly smoking routine. I wake up every morning telling myself enough is enough if I want to live up to my potential and see any sort of success and that I need to stop, at least for a week(but ideally forever) but once 7ish or 8ish rolls around, I go from considering getting high to knowing that it's just going to happen and that I might as well enjoy those bong rips and unfortunately despite telling myself I'd stop this morning, I will probably take some hits soon after I post this when I get ready for bed. Last week I made it two days, but eventually I gave in to my whims. My record since summer 2018 is one week(I made it a whole month just before summer 2018!!)

Anyway, these are probably all extraneous details and I'm taking waaay too long to get to my point, but currently despite telling my roommates everyday that I will stop and need to stop(they just laugh and tell me I'm full of shit), I always end up lighting up every night and enjoying it for the most part because it's a part of my routine. What I want to know is, if I continue to not be able to stop doing this every night(smoking maybe .2-.3 grams a night) how much long term damage am I doing to my brain? I feel so damn guilty thinking about how I'm ruining whatever cognitive abilities I have left and that I won't be able to get them back even if I stop. If and when I stop(because I know that this won't work for me especially when my career becomes more demanding), will I regain these abilities, or am I screwed because my brain is still developing? At least, if I can't stop now I'd like to feel less guilty and to have some closure in the hopeful fact that I'm just damaging my cognition short term, but my guess is that's wishful thinking. I really want to quit and am trying so hard(maybe not hard enough) but until I manage to kick this successfully, I wanted to see how much damage I‚Äôm doing.

Sorry again for the long post, and thank you so much for taking the time to read!

Three weeks ago i decided once in for all that is going to be part of my past. Not future. Untill couple of days ago ive come past the worst. I now have appetite again, eats three times a day, i dont have the scary nightmares sleeping 3 hours a night. So the worst part is over.

The problem for me now is that i feel my willpower and motivation got hit by a truck. I almost cant get anything done at work and I mostly want to sleep and relax at home to ride of the next 3-6 months.

I know from my cousin that it takes up to a year before your brain and body are fully restored. It just seem impossible to keep working in a job for that long period. Am i the only one experiencing this?

For those of you who can relate, do you have any advice of how to overcome the lack of and eventually gain more motivation to get things done? I dont doubt it is just a matter of time to get better but I dont doubt that +10yrs of addiction cannot be ridden of in about a month.

Then covid happened and being stuck inside with nothing to do was hard. I figured I could try smoking again but be responsible. I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt do it during the day, only in the evenings. That worked for like a week and then I was back to my old ways. 

I quit working out and I started reallyyy cutting my deadlines close for university and started making up excuses to my research supervisors. I started hiding it from my partner bc it was getting out of hand. That went on for about 3 months. 

After going through a quarter in two weeks (used to take me 4), I decided enough was enough. So I‚Äôm 4 days sober now. Everyday gets easier and I know that, in time, I‚Äôll start finding joy in things without being high again. It just takes time for your brain to start producing serotonin on its own again. I know this. But it‚Äôs still hard and I still miss it. 

I did go get prescription melatonin so that I couldn‚Äôt use sleep as an excuse to start again. That helps. I started vaping again. That helps too. 

Weed isn‚Äôt entirely detrimental to me. I can still function. But I‚Äôm not my best self. I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm actually more stressed on it bc I smoke to forget about my responsibilities rather than just get them done like I would if I were sober.

I've done so much over the past 7 years that I could not have done if I was still high all the time, or if I had killed myself. We are living through a time of such immense stress right now, on a global level, and I feel like I am returning more than ever to the skills I developed in early recovery. Last year I posted a timeline so here just two significant things that have happened since then. 

1. My spouse and I opened a small business 8 months ago. Obviously this is a really challenging time to be a small business owner but we are getting through it one day at a time - something I learned to do early in my recovery. 

2. Something I haven't mentioned in past posts is my physical pain, which has worsened a lot in the past year. I have had chronic migraine for a few years and this year I also got a fibromyalgia diagnosis because of my constant chronic body pain. It is challenging to engage with the online support communities for these conditions because a lot of people recommend medical marijuana which obviously isn't an option for me. I also wonder if my drug use was somewhat keeping these symptoms at bay when I was still smoking.

To anyone who is starting their recovery right now - you are doing a great job & I am proud of you! To the mods - it is so wonderful to come back to this sub and see how the community has grown, y'all are amazing.

I like living life high and for the past year that's what I've been doing but yesterday I got caught by my parents and I'm not sure what to tell them. I'm the smart one out of my group of friends and the one who is closest with all the parents because I enjoy hearing their perspectives on a lot of things, but I'm scared they're gonna think I'm horrible now and I don't know what to tell my mom. When she found out I told her why I did it, but not the full reasoning. I told her that it made me happy when nothing else could and that I wasn't sure what i'd be doing if I hadn't turned to it. I told her I don't want to try anti depressants because I've seen how they change people and the side effects it has and I don't want to be like that.

I've been a 24/7 smoker/vaper/consumer of cannabis since I was about 16 years old, and  I just turned 51.

I'd like to thank everyone on this subreddit for inspiring me to finally do what I've known I needed to do for many years.    I wish you all the best in your journey.     I know that if I can do this, anyone can.   Positive energy and much love to you all.",52,0

I feel like my issues stems from the fact that I was on probation for 6 months. But it‚Äôs been a year since then and I‚Äôve smoked nonstop. That‚Äôs why I got fired from my old job. I don‚Äôt remember who told me this but when they said this, I‚Äôve kept it in the back of my head.

As of today June 10, 2020 I have made the decision to quit smoking weed for good. What influenced my decision? Well ... Weed sucked the life out of me. It turned me into its slave. It stripped my potential away & it took the things from me that were the most valuable. It took me a while to see this but weed is not as friendly as the world makes it seem or as I've come to believe. It's great that it can make people feel relieved/relaxed or euphoric but I'm starting to open up my eyes to the truth that there aren't any benefits. Driving or sitting around for hours high is not beneficial. It's not my idea of living. I want to live. I want to dream. I want to be healthy. I want the most out of life & a life spent being high to me is no longer a life spent living. I went like 4 years smoking daily & have tried to quit on numerous occasions & I know that I can say for certain it doesn't work because it is just too addicting & always tricks me into returning to that nasty daily habit. I'm taking back my life from cannabis & I'm never returning because the second I think it's okay to take just 1 hit is the second I give up my freedom & return back to how I used to live in the past. NO!

Today I am free. Today is the beginning of a new journey. & I know this time is different because this time I've seen through the illusion that there aren't any benefits to continuing this lifestyle.

A few days ago, in desperation, I asked the internet for guidance on cannabis addiction self-care.  Through serendipitous (ok, maybe logarithmic, or maybe both) means I ended up here.

I spent hours scrolling, fascinated how there could be so many people out there in the world struggling to let go of the same addiction I've had for far too long to count, in secret, pretending my life is fine, that _I_ am fine, that I've got this, when really every second of every day I feel like a total fraud. I have no fucking clue what I'm doing so...

I don't know the rules of Reddit, though as I just stated I honestly don't feel like I really understand the rules the fucking anything these days. What even is life anymore? Was life ever anything to begin with?!

It seems fine for folks to post whatever here, to put their energy or intentions out there into the universe, so... Might as well add my own energy to the mix. 

Here I am, desperately trying to let go of a really long relationship to cannabis for good. I can't rely on her anymore to calm me down when I'm upset, or brighten the dark days with reminders of all the beauty and love there are in the world, or hold me softly until I fall asleep at night. We've been off and on for a while this year. I've been trying to slowly phase her out, and honestly was very methodical and successful, first no more smoke, then no more vaping or any inhalation, then edibles and finally tinctures, until only cbd. Supported by all the herbal homeopathic tricks I knew and with dedication to routine, sleep, exercise and staying busy I crushed it. I mean it was fucking hard (especially freaking nightmares & night sweats, damn), but I was committed to staying the course and I did and goddamn did it feel good to wake up by myself early before any alarm and feel energized and alive and hungry (!) and present... 

And then the shelter-in-place. The single-parenting of young kiddos while suddenly trying to do your very social, very in-person job from home. Being quarantined in a tiny apartment with two small children by yourself is really hard, man. Sigh. So I got some edibles... And then shit started getting real intense and I got some pre-rolls and next thing you know I'm rolling multiple js a day, I've got a new vape pen I secretly hit every time someone fights or refuses to eat the food I throw together from our emptying cupboards or takes three and a half hours to fall asleep at night.

For a while, being able to step out of a room with a screaming seven-year-old, take a few deep breaths and a hit of the vape pen, honestly made me feel able to make it through some rough rainy days stuck inside outnumbered by cranky kids. But I used too much cannabis for too long in my life and even after a significant detox and break, after just a few weeks of using again my tolerance has built right back up and here we are. Unable to ever feel high, but perpetually trying. Still feeling the consequences, though - lethargy, apathy, exaggeration of exhaustion and irritation, and that very palpable switch from cannabis as anxiety-soother to anxiety-enhancer. Not to mention the constant guilt and shame.

So enough is enough goddamnit. If not now, when? When will I commit to letting go of this toxic relationship for good? When will I treat my body with the respect it deserves? When will I trust in my own inner strength and potential?

Right fucking now.

Just threw out all vape pens, grinders, pipes, cartridges, and zero cannabis or products left in our space. I mean, I definitely smoked and vaped what was left almost ritually before throwing everything away, but I'm glad I did as it reminded me how pointless and unsatisfying cannabis is. 

I threw it all in a kitchen garbage can filled with leftover moldy soup and pasta so I know I won't try to dig it all out later. I feel lighter and drained and hopeful and exhausted and terrified and determined but I'm just gonna lay down, trust the fucking process and face tomorrow moment by moment as it comes.

Help?,"I made the decision to quit smoking weed about 6ish weeks ago. The first week was hell and because of what I went through then, I told myself that I didn't want to put myself through that again. 

All of my housemates smoke weed. Most of my friends still smoke weed but I've stayed strong and I've been able to resist. 

I started seeing someone about two weeks ago who smokes every night. I have deep feelings for this person and we get along really well. 

I wasn't sure if I could handle dating someone who smokes/uses weed because I hadn't dated someone since I stopped. 

When we first started seeing each other, I just asked if he could stay sober around me. As we got more comfortable around each other (we spent a considerable amount of time together in a span of 2 weeks - being that it's COVID and all and we're both working from home) he started having an edible in front of me. He makes it at home and I'd have wine. I don't really drink either but I would just because I think it can be strange/awkward to be sober by yourself. 

This person is actually one of the most responsible people I've met, moreso than folks who don't even smoke. 

I'm just really torn right now because when I spent the night at their place over the weekend - the first thing they did in the morning was get up to make the edible. And I thought, why do you need to do that if I'm here with you? So I got upset and left and let him know that I couldn't handle it.

He told me he was going to be sober for the week this week to see how much he can get done with his creative pursuits. And he called me today to say that says he uses it for medicinal purposes and that we should stop seeing one another because of our differences. 

I don't want to lose this person and the connection we have. And I'm thinking maybe it'll be okay because he's on top of his shit. I just really don't know. 

Are any of you dating someone who smokes weed and you're okay with it? Or continued to date someone who smokes and doesn't abuse it and therefore - you're okay with it? How do you handle it? 

I guess the main thing for me is that I want to be sober with him and I don't want to be hanging out with him if he's just going to be high.",2,1

* I never put it away after one hit. It's always at least 2 or 3

I'm hopeful I could smoke a couple times on the weekend and looking forward to that would motivate me to stay fully sober through the week. When I quit I was at the point of feeling ashamed of my smoking, but now drinking makes me feels that way too but because of self judgement, rather than worrying about others opinions with weed. Starting to feel like I think I'd rather be smoking. Need some outside opinions because I know if I ask my husband, friends, or parents they'll tell me to keep abstaining from weed and also stop drinking and I really don't feel like that is what I want to do. I know that sobriety should seem like a option but honestly, without sufficient motivation that just seems unnecessary. I'm confusing myself.

TLDR I used to smoke daily and haven't since Jan. Recently I am bored and drinking more than I want to, for health reasons. Thinking of going back to smoking 



EDIT
Added a TLDR and also this:
Well, everyone who commented seems to have the same opinion that now is not the time to start smoking again for me, with some adding I should curb the alcohol also. I just wanted to be clear that since quitting weed I spent a whole month 100% sober to make sure I was alright with that, and I was. I took a hot bath to relax my kind and body most nights, but other than that I was fine. When I started drinking again after that, it was socially and on weekends only until covid took away most of the things I do in my free time. So the excess drinking currently is fairly situational, in my opinion. I've just been thinking it'd be healthier to smoke rather than drink when I'm looking for a break from reality. 

TLDR of edit: I can and have and do spend plenty of time sober. Right now maybe not as much as normal, but life isn't normal.",0,1

Not committed enough to say the magic words ""never again"" that would make the next 2 weeks easier and, potentially, my life significantly more meaningful due to lack of active addiction.

Background: I am 43 and have been smoking marijuana on and off since I was 13.

I relapsed because I dealt with the stress of quarantine poorly. My wife is an active user so I have to quit in close proximity to it, but I have done so before. Before my recent relapse, I was clean for half a year. Before the relapse previous to this one, I had over 2 years clean. On a similar note, it has been 7 years since I had a drink. I have utilized 12 step programs and Recovery Dharma for assistance in the past, I will do so this time as well. Almost because of the relatively innocuous nature of the substance, (compared to other habit forming drugs) we need extra support lest we talk ourselves into using for that reason. So here I am, looking for support. Thanks in advance.

As I have with other abstinence attempts, I am using this opportunity to make other self-improvements, committing to abandon other things that seem to soothe me while they actually cause problems. This time around I am eating better, working out more, and giving up porn. For the time being, I am also giving up FB, Twitter, and Instagram... my mental health is suffering as it is.

My name is Robert, nice to meet you. I hope you all are having a nice day.",28,1

(55 days),"So I quit on April 15th, 2020 after 32 months of daily smoking, due to a final panic attack that made me make the decision to end all drug use. It‚Äôs been a roller coaster since then. I‚Äôve gone through the hole slew of symptoms such as insomnia, EXTREME anxiety, night sweats, depression, weight loss, and some crazy dreams. 

Week 1: The toughest phase when it comes to physical withdrawals such as the night sweats. Insomnia was at its worst here and I actually dreamt for the first time in more than I could remember. On the other hand, they weren‚Äôt the most pleasant of dreams. My appetite was also shot and eating wasn‚Äôt in the plans for me, because I had to smoke to get hungry. The anxiety picked up on day 4-5 or so. To the point that it was ER bound necessary. 

Week 2-3: The symptoms all persisted and the anxiety and depression tag teamed to be the worst of the symptoms. The insomnia made it magnify to the point that I had anxiety to even sleep. I felt like I was going to consistently die. Everything felt as if I was leading into an inevitable end that I wasn‚Äôt ready for. I just wanted to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. The problem is, that my version of normal was only while high. I had forgotten what it was like to be sober, let alone be dealing with anxiety. 

Week 4: By this point (after reading through countless forums) I had already been bed ridden for the exception of using the restroom and maybe walking around my apartment here and there. I felt like I had no energy and walking made me anxious. Eye floaters and visual snow had also been part of my psyche for about a month before I quit. These floaters however, were much more apparent after the anxiety became constant. I‚Äôd never dealt with anxiety (except for when I quit and some other rare memories of the past) before quitting. So this anxious mind state fueled my depression and DP/DR because I truly thought I was going crazy. 

Week 5-6: Entering this phase the anxiety was still persistent. If anything it‚Äôs the main thing that made this part difficult to deal with. It took over my body and mind. Enough to make me not enjoy anything and not really have enough energy to even workout. Exercise as I‚Äôve read countless times, is a powerful tool to get back to your life. It helps the brain start to re-wire at a better pace, yet this wasn‚Äôt possible at this point. I woke up and felt anxiety until I went to sleep or tried some supplement which calmed me down (that of which most didn‚Äôt). 

Week 7-8: At this stage in my recovery the anxiety finally hit a slowing down of pace. It hasn‚Äôt left completely yet. I wake up and feel the anxiety (as usual) but I don‚Äôt let it control me as much. I do the usual leg shaking and racing thoughts, but it rarely gets to the point that my heart starts playing tricks on me and my breathing goes out of the window. The anxiety is constant, but more bearable than the first couple of weeks. My thoughts do play tricks on me daily, especially with the DP/DR that you get from such a heightened and prolonged stress period. I feel as if things are fake often, but I just accept the thoughts and tell myself to calm down. I also have a weird feeling with being physically calm, I have to move something or keep myself occupied or the anxiety kicks in. Sleeping throughout the day is also something I can‚Äôt do either :/ 

2 months are almost coming up, and I hope I have the same relaxation of symptoms like others at the 2-3 month mark. Sometimes the symptoms will be worse than other days, but every week ahead of you will be better. Keep fighting, have faith that you‚Äôll return to normal.

This is great news if it is sustainable, but I wanted to ask if anybody else experiences this somewhat ""paradoxical"" reaction to weed? Reason I ask is because it's usually associated with a more calm and relaxed state of mind, yet I now realise that when I was stoned I was generally much more angry and obsessive in my thinking.

I'll be honest, the outing was rocky at first and it was very hard to stay present, but towards the end of the night I felt really refreshed. Apparently I can enjoy things besides weed.

I am also glad to say that for the first time in a while I'm beginning to look forward to my life without weed. I've fucked up in the past, wasted so much of my energy, time and money on weed, but now I feel like all the things I've dreaded doing are turning into opportunities.

And sorry if this post belongs in r/anxiety and not this one.

From April of last year to about two weeks ago, I‚Äôve been chronic with my weed usage, mainly because it helped me silence my anxiety and deal with my Aspergers but I KNEW I had a full on addiction, if I didn‚Äôt have thc in my system I‚Äôd be searching HARD for a way to get it, this troubled my family and they decided the best way to try to get me to quit was to give me horror stories, stories about how people they knew developed psychosis or schizophrenia from weed usage and that I could very well be next.

Naturally I laughed it off and kept on smoking but two weeks ago something different happened, while smoking up, my body finally cashed the cheque my poor posture wrote and I ended up with a pinched nerve in my neck, giving me a weird sensation in the back/base of my head. Not ever feeling this before, my anxiety immediately jumped to the conclusion that my family was warning me about; ‚ÄúI have psychosis and I‚Äôm going crazy‚Äù, my high mind thought.

Since then I‚Äôve quit the weed completely, unlike before I absolutely do not want or have a desire to smoke it but my anxiety is still here, I wake up with this impending sense that I‚Äôm counting down the hours til my brain pops, and I‚Äôm unable to even enjoy my nerdy hobbies of writing, playing games, or even D&D, because my anxiety has me thinking ‚Äúthis is what will trigger your psychosis, you‚Äôre gonna go crazy from this‚Äù. It‚Äôs maddening and I feel myself over analyzing every thought that enters my headspace, every little thing I hear or word that people say because I‚Äôm scared that anything could be the loose thread that unravels my world.

I called an addictions counsellor with these worries and was told that I‚Äôm just carrying high anxiety and that as I continue to be sober that it‚Äôll go away, but it‚Äôs been two- almost three weeks now and I still feel myself second guessing my sanity, I‚Äôve been trying cold showers, exercise and sleeping more but I still feel this impending doom descending on me, even trying to smoke up again doesn‚Äôt help because my mind feels like I‚Äôm making the issue worse.

I wasn't aware of the negative effects it had on me until I realized I'd been isolating myself for most of the time, I was eating like shit, I had no motivation to get work done, and I was tearing apart my relationship with my girlfriend of 2 years.

They say weed is supposed to cure you of your anxieties, but in reality, it only made mine worse.  Every day I'm tormented by anxious thoughts and paranoia - so much so that I can't distinguish between normal me thinking or weed-brain me thinking.  My mind is totally fogged over and I have trouble recalling what should be very distinct memories.

My dad's side of my family has a history of substance abuse issues, so the ability to become addicted is basically hardwired in my brain.  I know of this weakness, yet I still partake in weed smoking whenever the opportunity arises - whether alone, with my friends, or with my girlfriend, though both of the latter use it recreationally and not daily like me.

Oh, and for some good news, my friends and GF are helping me stay clean.  So now the only issue I have to worry about in the body of text above is myself!  Both parties agreed that they would stop using entirely in order not to tempt me.  I'm glad I have such a supportive social circle, it's one of the most powerful things a recovering addict can have.

So, today marks the day I put an end my shameful habit and build my self-confidence and happiness back up.

I have a fucking addicitve personality. I always developed addicitive habits, since I can remember. Even though some of them are very strange.

It started when I was maybe like 10, when I had much free time at home (without parents) and started to play many video games on our family PC. My parents only allowed me two play half an hour a day, but I soon used every parent-free minute to play time-intensive garbage games (i. E. Metin2). I sometimes stood up at night to play without my parents noticing. It soon extended to flashing different things onto my jailbroken iPod Touch, often without a practical reason many hours a night. 

After I got my first Android phone (around 14/15 years old) and getting a PC for birthday, I started flashing, later compiling Android ROMs to my phone. That may sound strange but I am pretty sure it was a kind of addicition, since I sometimes preferred it over hanging out with freinds, and I didn't tell noone not even my (then) grilfriend. I don't even know why I didn't tell noone, but I guess because I felt that something already was out of order back then. 

When I was 16, I finally started smoking weed every day. First, it was a gram a week, later I smoked arround 2 grams a day. It steadily kept growing and I am concerned it still is. The last few months, it didn't even feel  good everytime anymore. I tried to quit a few times, but always failed. This time, I broke my record and am currently on day 15 without smoking. 

&#x200B;

When I am craving I am struggling so hard, because I am scared of another addicition. I feel the urge to drink these times more then ever, even though I (mostly) resisted it and don't drink much more often the before. Since I don't have to do much for university and don't frequently can work due to Corona, I am really struggling not to smoke.  I just got so much time, feel exhausted from doinng nothing even though I sleep great. I am thinking of just smoking again and then search a therapy to help me with addicitve personality treats.

After six months of actively trying to quit and failing- daily, weekly, continuously...here we are. I had been smoking daily for about 8 years and had previously been an alcoholic.

**Things that helped me:**

* Routine! (Plan your day the night before. Know what you'll do the next day as soon as you wake up.)
* One. Day. At. A . Time.
* Each day begins with meditation and Wim Hof breathing.
* Each day ends with some light yoga/zen time, thank yourself for persevering towards sobriety and making yourself a better human.
* Learn about the dopamine system and how your behavior is wired. Knowing what is going on in your head may provide answers and then you can implement solutions.
* Get the f%$k off social media and the news. That garbage is designed to trigger negative emotions and hook you. Social media lowers your self worth, distracts you from the present, and is designed to give you dopamine releases (the same system you're currently trying to fix by not smoking).

This journey was one I took alone... isolated due to covid. Maybe that helped because I wasn't around any old smoke buddies. If you have a good friend or family group, stay connected. We're deeply wired for human connection.

The first 2-3 weeks may have been the most psychologically challenging minutes and days of my life..I wasn't sure I'd make it through. Hell, I wasn't sure of anything. I was going minute to minute at times.

But here at day 50- it's hard to describe what life can be like until you break through. All I can say is that not smoking changed me in so many ways- ALL for the better.

Whoever you are and whatever your story is, always believe that you can change. All the love, all the power.

**Tldr: Things that helped me quit:** routine, meditation, yoga, quit social media, learn about dopamine system, keep believing in yourself.

**Edit- Thank you for the gold! I'm not sure what to do with it, but it's shiny and it was kind of you.** 

**Edit- It's been really great chatting with everyone today, I was a lurker on here for months and the support we give each other is what will pull us through.**",579,1
907,2020-06-09 11:13:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gzp16b/one_month_milestone_quitting_tips/,One month milestone quitting tips,"45 years old toker since 1992 here. I have been trying to kick weed off and on for close to 3 decades. In 2018 I found /r/leaves. Since then I made it to 6 months twice and I had two big relapses. But the majority of the past two years I have had weed out of my life and that has been a great thing.

I will list here some of the things that have helped me along the way. Much of this I have learned from experience and from others here on this subreddit.


This is what got me away from it:

* First step: Make a list of things I hate about being a stoner. Keep that list handy and refer back whenever tempted. Add to the list anytime you think of more negative things.
* It's very important to fall out of love with weed. She is a physically and mentally abusive ex. Some people like to give him/her a name. Maybe just Mary Jane
* Daily journaling about how things are going with the quit. Getting circular thoughts out of your head takes a big weight off. Get things out of your brain (ram) and onto a journal (storage). This could be on paper or in a journal on your phone/laptop
* Start a calendar with X on each day of the quit. Or use an app that counts days sober
* Spending time here on /r/leaves and sorting by new. Reading and participating helps a lot. This is one of the biggest differences between these and all my previous unsupported quit attempts over the years. Helping others with similar issues is a great way to stay on track. Look into the subject of service and recovery
* make a list of things that have improved since I quit. Once you start to see real improvement a couple weeks in, write those things out and keep it handy. The positives on that list will be stuck in your mind if you ever relapse. This list of how much better/easier life is without weed will be very effective in ruining the high. If you want to get high again, you have to give up this list. There are a lot of positives once you get going, so it's a lot to give up. Keep adding to the list along the way as you notice new positives
* Stay busy with hobbies, interests, volunteering, projects, cleaning, organizing, walks, travel, daytrips, etc. This is really important. You need to dig deep and brainstorm a huge list of random stuff you are interested in. Variety is key. 
* Volunteering can be a great way to meet new people outside of the old stoner friends group. As a side benefit it helps distract from yourself and takes up idle time. 
* Watch out for replacement habits. Increased drinking, other drugs, shopping, eating, internet/social media. Your subconscious will be trying to get dopamine hits however it can. It's important to track and observer these things so they don't get out of hand. 


The first couple of weeks of acute withdrawal issues are tough. Here are a few tips.

* If possible, don't attempt to do anything too complicated or frustrating. You will get short tempered and want to run back to weed for comfort.
* watch familiar and funny tv or movie (for example The Office, Seinfeld reruns, bloopers, etc) If what you are watching is too challenging or complicated, it might peak anxious feelings and make you want to use weed to cope.
* avoid too much random internet and social media. Your brain will spin. Look into social media addiction. Check out /r/nosurf
* Find something easygoing to do like coloring, sketching, whittling, guitar. Creating something helps release dopamine in a healthy way. Little wins help a lot.
* Have some easy foods ready like after a sickness or surgery. Yogurt, jello, buttered noodles, saltines, mashed potatoes, rice, etc. Have some antacids or pepto handy too.
* stay hydrated.  Emergen-c has electrolytes and can be a nice alternative to water.  Soda water like LaCroix can be very refreshing and help break up unusual throat feelings that come with quitting.
* You might get stress and tension headaches.  Be ready with some Tylenol and ibuprofen. Yoga for headaches can be found on YouTube. Fresh air can help too.
* Go on long walks or bike rides with a podcast. It will ease anxiety and help wear your body down for better rest at night. It also counts as exercise if the idea of the gym or running is too much. 
* Listen to interesting podcasts or ebooks. They will distract you from yourself and help keep your circling thoughts at bay. Combine this with the walk or bike ride.
* yoga/stretching. Check YouTube for yoga with Adrienne for anxiety, stress, and headaches
* don't be too hard on yourself for losing patience and temper. Just try and catch yourself before hurting friends and family. Journaling about when these things happen can help you find patterns and give you more control
* expect intense, exhausting, and confusing dreams. Seriously disturbing stuff based on your deepest worries, fears, and secrets. I have experienced these many months into my quits
* try not to make any big dramatic decisions until the dust settles on your quit. Sleep on any big decisions changes if possible until a few weeks or months after quitting.
* if you start thinking if a bunch of overwhelming stuff you need to do, just put it all in a list.  This avoids worrying about all of it in a circular pattern. Look into the Getting Things Done concept from David Allen. The mind is great at thinking of things, but not so great with storage and recall.
* expect anxiety attacks and don't give them too much power.  It's just the addiction monkey thrashing as you hold it's head under the water.  Anxiety attacks should start to settle a month or so in. But then again, sometimes they come from real problems you have to face with a sober reality. Those problems will not fix themselves by quitting weed, so this anxiety could be with you for a while
* Be prepared for sleep issues.  For me it's waking up way too early.  A few weeks in, my sleep was much improved and I feel i am getting better rest than I have in years.  But sometimes I still wake up way too early. But hey, bright side that's more time in the day.
* some people get a lot of night sweats.  If possible keep the bedroom really cool and run a dehumidifier to keep the air dry.",13,0

I feel pretty proud of this and I feel better than I have in years. Here are some things that happened to me in this time. I wrote them down for you to consider doing the same, or to stay motivated.


- I am slowly starting to rid myself of anxiety. Turns out most of my anxieties were caused by the weed, as I grew paranoid over even the smallest things.

- I have regained ambition. I have auditioned for music college at a conservatory, and just a few days ago I heard I'm permitted in. I am chasing my dreams again, instead of a stupid herb.

- I no longer am unproductive. My house is clean, I wash my laundry in time, I shower everyday, I eat healthy, and work does not get put off anymore.

- I literally dream again. I hadn't had a dream in years, up until they started coming back a few weeks ago.

- I sleep much better, and much more regularly. I no longer feel the need to sleep in everyday, as I feel energised in the morning.

- I am rekindling old friendships, and I have miraculously got a second chance with a girl I really like. I was anxious to talk to anyone before, but now most of my relationships in life are much healthier.

- I save heaps of money. I spent about 250-300 bucks a month on weed.

- My breathing has improved lots, and I am motivated to excersise again. I feel much better in my own skin because of it.

Of course, I am not there yet. I still talk to my shrink weekly because lots of shit I used to suppress to forget using weed has come to surface again. But all this is just a months progress. Imagine what could happen in a few more.",7,0

The reminder goes like that:

-----------------------
So you said you want to smoke just once...
Well, but are you OK with:
- loosing weeks or months feeling depressed?
- loosing connection with people?
- feeling worthless?
- neglecting healthy habits that made you feel so good?
- neglecting or doing half way work & things you are passionate about?
- going through days without passion?
- telling yourself that you can moderate, although you  cannot.

Remember:
Something switches in your mind, when you smoke.
You start to follow short term pleasure like a junkie.
You behave in the way that hurts people you love.
You behave like bipolar psycho bitch.
Smoking is not worth the risk.

And...
Aren't you curious who you really are?
Free.
-------------------


Day 4. I feel better, but I still wasn't able to have good sleep, so I am after 2 almost sleepless nights. I feel weak and still depressed and anxiuous, but I have better control of mind, conversations with people are sharp now, I am more able to see the beauty of small moments. 
I cannot believe, how I scratched my skin in several places, when depressed & anxious, now it needs to heal and well I Used to look better in the past :D
I was working today a little, but I decided I am too weak to go to dance class. I will go in a few days.
I definitely have more self care now. I am allowing myself to feel tired. I try to eat something healthy, but I am allowing myself also to eat üçï, as I know these first days are nightmare and I can allow myself to have some small pleasures.

It kind of scared me now to go around my music & mostly using friends, I don't feel like I would relapse, but I feel shitty and not really positive and I just want to chillout through these days in home. Hopefully I will BE able to add some news activities each day and until weekend I will feel strong enough to get back to life completely.

Yesterday I visited my best friend for the first time in months (more than my actual last day of smoking). He also happens to be my former dealer. He texted me saying he felt lonely and missed me so I felt like I had the willpower to walk in that house again. 

We didn't talk about much while we were there because he was swamped by other friends who wanted their computers built (his passion is computers) and there were people(who are also friends and acquaintances of mine)  waiting on him to deal dope. Needless to say, I could tell he was overwhelmed when I first arrived.

I was happy to just spend a little time with him and his cats. I was practically surrounded by weed and didn't once consider smoking, I just felt unwavering in my journey to remain clean. My friend did ask me if HE could smoke while I was there, and he chose to use his dab pen to make it less invasive on my senses.

Perhaps the only reason I'm writing this is to entertain the idea that the next time I go over there, I feel like I want to talk to him about him about quitting.

I care about my best friend and I feel like at this point, I'm literally the only person in his life that can have this conversation about quitting and I dont believe it will create distance. I can see how someone can feel lonely but have friends all around him, but I also know that most of these people that see him only want one thing from him: his weed. I think that fact makes him feel more lonely because I think he knows that if he quits selling weed, no one will come hang out with him, which is far from the truth.

914,2020-06-09 09:03:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gzmpzi/be_stron_23_years_of_bad_habit/,"Be stron, 23 years of bad habit!!","Hi guys, I can say 5 days ago I smoked my last one.

Smoker for ""**23**"" years, 4-6x day, everyday. Tried several times to leave it, but unsuccessfully, because I really didn¬¥t want so.

Married, 2 children, succesfull life, I must say. I thought that smoke didn¬¥t affect me in my daily life, I was totally convinced about it, but I was wrong. It started when I was 16, occasionally during weekends, when I was on party. But quickly the habit increased to a daily basis.

Here in my country the laws were not very restrictive and it¬¥s ""social accepted"", difficulting the situation. Too many friends of mine are/were smokers too. The purchase of the material is quite easy as well.

But now, after 23 years consuming, I can say I am tired and afraid, not about my mind, I am lucky about it. But lastly, I can notice some bad physical effects on me, well known if you are a smoker too, not neccesary to describe. I really don¬¥t want to analyse deeply the bad consequences the habit had on me, on my family relationships, because I really feel sad, and I really want to be strong. Mental control is the most important, I need to think in a possitive and proactive way, I am fully sure about it.

I must say that, in my job, I travel abroad very often, sometimes to  low restrictives countries with the drugs, so I combined intensive use with 2-3 weeks of abstinence, 5-6 times a year. During that period, I really passed very bad moments, specially with the insomnia, but I always thought it was because of the jet lag, but now I know I was in a mistake.

If you are decided to leave the habit, please, take in consideration that it¬¥s not really hard, there are some bad moments, especially with the insomnia, but it¬¥s relative easy if you are really aware of it. For example, leave the tobacoo is hardest than this, maybe 100 times harder!!!

But you need to find the real motivation: in my case, my children, my health and my family. And the afraid I have to a cancer disease (unfortunately I had some cases in my family)

The mind is more powerful than the body!!! Be strong!!!

Now, my main problem is the insomnia and the sense of humour, but I know about my last experience that it will only take some days. I am strong enough!!! And I have my wife supporting, she understand the situation (because she already lived this situation in the past), which makes me feel backed up.

So my advise is:

\- To look for a motivation to leave it. The most important.

\- To be convinced about that, the addiction to some substance (for example, the sugar), is always bad.!!Make an use, not an abuse is a good motto!!

\-  To know and understand that you are a drug addict, it¬¥s hard but you need to understand it.

\-  And don¬¥t be afraid, it¬¥s more easy than you think. Be positive!!! The second most important point.

I know that It¬¥s only the beginning of a long way, but I am fully convinced that I am an ex-addict. I am not going to consume it anymore. I am 100% sure. I loved it, I still love it, but this is not the correct way. I hope that I never will consume this anymore is not a correct sentence, I know that I am not going to consume anymore.

Thanks for this community, it helped me a lot. And I will read it in my bad moments, I know I will have them, but I already took the decision, the most important of all.

Kisses for everybody, enjoy the life!!! My best wishes, good luck guys.",14,0

I‚Äôm on my third day without smoking. I really didn‚Äôt think withdrawal from marijuana was a real thing but apparently it is because I have been so sick the last two days. I first smoked 10 years ago when I was 14. I have smoked pretty much every day since I was 18, except for taking a year off while on probation at 19. I smoke multiple times a day but lately it‚Äôs been 1-3 times a day max because I‚Äôm back at work and it makes me anxious. 

I realized it makes my anxiety worse more than it‚Äôs helpful usually (I use it to cope with chronic stomach issues). I think I have been in denial about the fact that it‚Äôs not good for me for a while now, and almost exactly 72 hours ago I decided to quit.

However, I have been having major stomach issues, nausea, chills, sweats, and depression. I read up on it and this is apparently typical of withdrawal symptoms if you 1. Have smoked for several years 2. Smoke every day 3. Started smoking before the age of 18. I check every one of these boxes. 

I‚Äôm having a really hard time coping with the physical symptoms. It has made me want to give in and smoke more than once but I haven‚Äôt yet. I have to go back to work tomorrow though and I fear that the symptoms will take over my body. I could hardly lay in bed last night with the lights off and everything without feeling sick so I‚Äôm not sure how I can even deal with it if I‚Äôm working and talking to people all night. I‚Äôm really anxious and not sure what to do. Any advice?",6,0

First im new to this sub so nice to meet you all.

I smoke pot since more than 10 years now (started pretty young). Right in the morning when i go out of bed to the moment i go to sleep, i smoke joints after joints.

Im a unemployed musician who is living thanks to the help from the governement (where i am you can get around 500/600euro a month if you are unemployed) so i got the luxury to have plenty of free time to work my music and stuff related to it.

But there is a problem : in normal times (so when im not sober) im already dealing with a lack of motivation (that lot of non smoker musician friends got too, if you are musician/artist you maybe know what im talking about) but in general that is okay, i still manage to get the sh*** done, even if i know that i could do more, and im happy with that. 

But when im sober, this is almost impossible for me to find any motivation to work seriously.. I just stand there on my computer doing nothing but meaningless stuff, watching youtube videos, browsing random forums, etc..

Maybe this is related to the fact that i started doing music when already being a pothead, so maybe the association of the two is too strong, idk..

I wanted to know if there is musicians or artist here who have struggled with the same thing, and maybe get some advices!

I've been a smoker for a long time, 10 - 11 years. I've lied, stealed and caused pain around me to my closest and dearest and today I want to and need to quit weed. A few other things, I have a job though I'm currently on furlough so it's easy to sit around and do nothing and get high all the time. Honestly, smoking weed long term creates a bubble, within that bubble time goes far quicker than it feels and fast forwarding 12 years down the line, here I am on reddit posting this wondering where the fuck is my life going? Me and my parents have had our up and downs over the years that's for sure, some nasty downs and some great ups. My Dad found out he had cancer last year, I'm not entirely sure on the wording, *does quick google* 'Squamous cell carcinoma' and I feel that the weed has been a coping mechanism even now, feeling hopelessly stuck away as he shields from the coronavirus. I just want to make them proud n shit and it's difficult and even more difficult because of my Dad. I'm scared when Wednesday comes I'll be buying my usual weed without a care in the world then potentially asking for help towards the end of the week. Ever since me and my baby ma split up and contact with my son was cut it forever became a difficult cycle of paying child maintenance, never having money to even consider going to court even if I wanted to leaving his Mom in the winning position always and he's 5 in July and years go by quick. I'm just sad, depressed, nearly 3 months into lockdown and I feel I don't really have a purpose and have considered ending myself but that would be selfish on my son, my dad's battle and everyone who actually gives a fuck. But this lockdown is ruining me and fuelling my incredibly addictive behaviour so here I am resorting to reddit before I end up in a nut house. I could go on and on forever about everything but I'll save it for any comments. üòî

So good, so much support. Thank you everyone. Today was manageable. I've noticed what I call my 'waking hour', when the need for weed kicks me in the chops: 1PM - 3PM, danger hours. I was sincerely tempted today, and you know what really helped me? YOU GUYS? WTF? Faceless internet love saving the day? THANK GOD! 

So, whoever is reading this, I'm writing this personally to you now: Thank you for your time and energy.

So yes, we're just beginning and I've had a few fine folk already saddle up. The mountain is still far in the distance, but we're going to make it. We're going to drag that stupid ring all the way back to Mordor and throw that shit in the pit. 

It's really crazy, I've taken breaks longer than 4 days several times for vacations, health, whatever, but it was different. When I thought weed was still an option I got withdrawal, anxiety, all the stuff. But this time it's different. I feel resolute, certain. I'm at peace and I have confidence that this is going down. For some reason this attitude seems to directly combat the 'withdrawal' aspect, which leads me to think my withdrawal may have been largely psychosomatic. 

""This is easy.""
""I can do this.""
""I want to really live.""

Side note: You may notice I'm posting late afternoon that I had victory over the current day, which does technically leave 1/3 of the day for unscrupulous high-jinks (pardon the pun), but no worries. I don't indulge or have any supplies at home, I'm leaving my office soon and I have ZERO DESIRE to get high right now, which is a whole new high in itself. It's all about our mindset. 

Tomorrow we saddle up again, fight another battle, win another victory, add another notch. DAY 5 WILL BE MINE

I have been staying up super late (2 or 3 in the morning) so I can smoke in peace when everyone else in the house is asleep. This results in my waking up around 11 and laying in bed even longer than that. Last night, I fell asleep around 2 again, even though I didn‚Äôt smoke. What really struck me was that this morning when I woke up at 9:30am, I wasn‚Äôt even tired. I wasn‚Äôt groggy. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to roll over and go back to sleep. Nor did I feel the need to wallow in the bed. Of course, I don‚Äôt have as much energy as I want, but it‚Äôs only day 2 and I know it‚Äôll take time. I do have much more energy than before, just didn‚Äôt realize how much of an energy deficit I was in. I meditated and did yoga this morning. I made plans to spend time with my sister this afternoon, and I‚Äôm actually sticking to them instead of cancelling with an excuse (but really, I just want to stay home, get high, and wallow). Other than the tremors and night sweats and slight loss of appetite, I haven‚Äôt had any bad withdrawal symptoms YET, but I‚Äôm not counting them out of eventually occurring yet either. So far my pro/con list looks like this:

Pros
- Much less anxious
- Much less irritable
- Depression is GONE
- more present
- clearer thoughts
- more energy
- more time
- more money (Already!)
- my voice is super clear!
- more feeling
- better parenting
- cleaner space
- prettier lips

Cons
- tremors
- night sweats (which I‚Äôve always gotten unless I smoke immediately before sleeping, even then I wake up sweating)
- less appetite/weight loss (was already right on the brink of normal/underweight BMI)


Definitely keeping it going because my cons list is pathetic and my pros are awesome and making me really happy. I‚Äôm happy. I have more feelings than just being either super calm or super irritated, which described me before getting sober. Now I feel all the things and I feel so much more real! So much more grounded.

Smoking saved me  and now its either I never live comfortable, never find a job because of the drug tests and mentally feel okay, or I constantly let my delusions and impulses get the best of me as I relapse on one of many substances I swore I wouldn't become a slave too. Thank you for listening, I just don't know where to go from here. I already have such a bad benzo habit, and I feel smoking is all that keeps it from completely consuming me.

UGH I dont know what the hell is wrong with my brain.

Been mentally desperate to quit for 2+ years with no success except a month in 2018 when I was hospitalized for CHS.) Which triggered the great need to quit. I started smoking every single morning, day, night, before I did anything, before I went anywhere, before I ate, slept, etc. when I was 16. So 10 years of smoking all day everyday. Mostly bong until recently. I made a promise two months ago to myself and my partner that I was going to finally quit. I've been lying everyday since. I wait until they leave or go for a run etc and hit it. Or wait for them to sleep or leave me alone. Pop eye drops in spray a lil perfume. BAM. Back to being a piece of shit. 

I feel like a fucking crazy nut. I feel like I literally cant stop as I'm putting 0 thought into the action of smoking and there for I robotically do it without thinking. I feel like I have no control. I feel like my life is revolving around it. 

I'm out right now and I'm already going nuts in my head for the next hit. I cant get more. I refuse to.

Wish me luck please because your girl is really really struggling here. I hope I succeed this time I'm so sick of this.

But i relapsed after that one month as i quit my job before quitting .. after 2 successful weeks .. got another job which was sooooo stressful to the point that i had to relapse after making one month .. and i couldn't quit as i needed the money .. however .. i've resigned one month later ..

and since then i was smoking like a chimney .. made 14 days last october and relapsed !

This time .. here iam .. day 13 .. but the problem is .. i can't sleep at all .. i mean at all ... best thing i get is 1 weird hr of weird sleeping that is accompanied with some very strange dreams that seems too realistic ... !

I know i should tire my self through the day by exercising or walking .. etc .. problem is ..

i get my hr of sleep usually 5-6 am or 6-7 am

And i begin the day while iam already exhausted .. to the point that i can't do any physical effort .. not even walking ...

And i don't know what to do ... ?!

plz don't tell me to take herbs or to drink milk .. this is amateurs stuff :D

any help would be more than appreciated !",2,0

I am productive...but feel like I'm drowning. I keep saying I don't have a problem and I don't need to stop but my sober brain knows what I need to do.

I have smoked just about every day for 4 years. Every night I go to bed telling myself that's it. I'm so tired of it. Of worrying about getting weed, whether or not I smell, if my eyes are red, if people are going to find out, etc.  But like I keep doing it??? I'm so over it. 

I kept a journal for the past ~10 days and tracked every time I smoked. I would take about 9-15 hits every day, smoking every 90 minutes to 3 hours- really as much as I could hide. All day. It's like I was trying to live in between highs but it's all I cared about. I say fuck that, I'm more important.

My mental game is shit, I'm depressed as fuck, anxious as fuck, it's all just a big bag of shit. My gut biome sucks from all the shit eating from being high and coping with food. I'm exhausted all time time and I don't feel better when I smoke any more.

I want to be above this. I want to be done. I want to read and write and enjoy and feel again. Weed is not the sole reason I feel this way but it's not helping me anymore. This is me saying I'm done for now and thank you all for sharing your stories. I feel like a want to cry, like I'm grieving what I have done to myself, all the time I've lost.

I love weed but she doesn't love me back right now. I have to be strong for myself. I don't have anyone irl to share this with yet but I wanted to declare my love to myself to stop for a while and recover. 

Here I come, ready to be myself again. I'm scared but ready to rid of that feeling like I always need something / need to be high to get by.

I'm excited to get through one whole day clean today, then I can finally go to bed proud of myself. 

If y'all can do it, I can do it. Thank you.",22,0

‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd partied a little less. People always say ‚Äòbe true to yourself.‚Äô But that‚Äôs misleading, because there are two selves. There‚Äôs your short term self, and there‚Äôs your long term self. And if you‚Äôre only true to your short term self, your long term self slowly decays.‚Äù

I immediately applied this to my quit journey. When I have cravings, I try to remember that my ‚Äúshort term self‚Äù wants to get high. But my ‚Äúlong term self‚Äù made a decision to quit. This has been so helpful to me not only with weed sobriety but also with alcohol sobriety (that journey started about five weeks before I quit pot). So, when the cravings hit, remember your long term self!

Edit: Can‚Äôt believe this post resonated with so many people! Thank you so much for the awards! This sub has had such a positive impact on my life and I want to thank everyone who has posted here before that gave me the support and inspiration I needed.

I smoked for 11 years and I had edibles every now and then but I notice once that dab pen came around I had zero control!! Before that I just used flower and I could actually manage that and the occasional edible. 

I remember I was staying away from them for a while because it just seemed odd to me to just inhale super strong oil. I mean the THC in the ones I would get where 85-90 which is crazy. As soon as I started with them I got hooked for 3 years...all day everyday no matter what. That‚Äôs when I saw my biggest change of not being social, staying in..super lazy, just smoking none stop. Also started to take edibles a lot to match that high I stopped getting after a while. 

It got to the point where being blazed out of my mind was the normal so I didn‚Äôt really feel it in a way. I knew I had to quit for a whole year before I actually did it and it was hell! I think I‚Äôm the next few years we will see a lot of negative cases. Weed Is much stronger now specially concentrates. Back in the day it was so mild so not many people went through this weird shit, I remember even older ppl telling me they hated the strong stuff they would look for stuff with weak THC today.",35,0

Awesome day. I purposefully stayed to busy to even think of weed. I was up at 5AM and literally worked until 7PM. It was awesome, I feel so good.  I'm really proud of having such a productive day.

Thoughts which are helping: ""This is easy."", ""It's not a big deal."", ""I want to really live my life.""  and, of course, my personal disgust. Which continues to be a motivator.


On my previous post I received a bunch of encouraging and constructive replies, many condemning my 1,000 day goal. Well, I thought I should share a bit about me. You see, as you are, I am unique. I count everyday of my life, which is also a bit of a secret weapon for me now. I started doing it on day # 13,444, I'm up to 13,778 (as of yesterday). Counting my days has really helped keep me present and really works for me. Also, this isn't my first time doing something like this. 2.5 years ago I took up yoga  with a goal... You got it, 1,000 days of consistency. I'm sitting around the 800 mark now, so for those of you who feel a 1,000 day goal is to ambitious please take heed, I'm a long term type of person, I often plan in years. I will do this.

Someone also noted that if I'm taking such a long break why don't I just make this permanent? Many reasons. Whenever I tell the addict in me 'never again', it panics, kicks me into overdrive, the need for weed. So, I've learned to negotiate with myself. I know I can hit long term goals, and that there's a crazy person in me trying to stay high, so I made a deal. 1,000 days.


Also, I really do enjoy weed, I think there are positive aspects to it, but I have a really toxic relationship with it right now. My plan is to take a break, long enough to explore who I am without it for a serious amount of time, and then assess whether or not I want to reintroduce weed into my life, on my terms.



Ok my friends, another trip around the sun without our crutches! Excelsior! 



I love you guys. Carry on.",8,0

When I first had to take a month long break it pretty much court ordered and it gave me extreme anxiety.

Then a few years later I decided to take a break and that gave me a little anxiety but it was much easier, probably because I was choosing it do it.

I started smoking again I think like two months after I stopped just cause I was bored and I was in a new city and wanted to make friends.

At this point I had realized I didn't like who I was when I was high but I didn't care because I was bored and I was already used to not liking myself. I started smoking only at night and it progressed from there.

Recently I stopped again and this time I think it's for good. It's been about a month that I haven't smoked at all but recently I started smoking when drunk or when I'm on my period and my stomach hurts. It's been pretty easy to maintain not smoking any other time and I don't think I'm going to start again full time.

But I just smoked because I couldn't sleep and I literally felt myself become insecure. I literally thought to myself about asking my boyfriend for reassurance about something.

I also use the ""Grounded"" app on my phone which is a good source of positive reinforcement. Like most sobriety apps it tracks your time and money saved. I've saved about $60 so far. My little seed is growing a sprout and I get to watch as it turns into a tree. It's cheesy but I guess it's a fun metaphor for how this change will grow into something big. 

Hope you all are doing alright. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster but I think I'm learning how to ride it. Surprisingly my cravings have been nonexistent but I know that it's easy to get complacent as I get further in my journey.

So my story is I was using highly concentrated vapes and edibles (legal) when I got accidentally addict to them for a year.

I decided I wasn't grieving my mothers death properly and just  stopped smoking.

I had really terrible withdrawl ranging from physical issues to psychological.. and I was worried I screwed up my brain for good because after the acute withdrawal passed I still felt like an empty void..  or a bored zombie.


Finally something in my brain came back full force. I noticed some strange feelings of nostalgia and then a full range of comfort, excitement and happiness came over me like a wave.

I spent the rest of my day fully enjoying the food I made.. I got excited to eat it.. oh my god I felt pleasure when I ate it.

I went for a walk and just felt grateful for the sunset. 
I got an exercise high finally which I havent had in 5 months.

I was enjoying my surrounding and found pleasure in cleaning my apartment.

So for those out there who have post acute withdrawal syndrome like I did. It does get better. I didnt believe it. Funnily enough I had such bad body pains this morning I thought I was getting worse.

Please if you want a full life it will come back to you. Dont measure your timeline of sobriety and healing to anyone else. Be gentle and just roll with the punches...settle into your discomfort away from weed.

Because one day you will be pleasantly surprised when you fall in love with the world again ‚ô°",8,0

I finally quit a little over a year ago. It was not easy, it was a rollercoaster. But I am so glad I did.

You know when you're so tired you'll just laugh at anything? That's how I feel after not sleeping. And I saw the sun rise.

I broke the rule of ""you have to sleep every day"" that everyone else followed (sheep lol /s).

Idk I guess it feels like seeing the same world in a different light. I even feel energized when I don't sleep, in a slow way though. I'm REALLY hoping someone knows what I'm talking about and can describe it better.

Anyway, it's 4h40 where I live, don't think I'm gonna sleep tonight but it doesn't bother me.

Getting caught in a plane crazy story,Once I sneaked a cartridge inside of a big sharpie so I can get it pass TSA. I was able to get it on the plane but before lift off I wanted to get a little buzz. So I went to planes restroom to take a few hits. The new planes have a system where they can detect vape smoke which I didn‚Äôt know. So when I blew it out the alarm went off.. I swear at this point my heart was jumping out off my chest because it states on the smoke detector that is a federal crime to smoke on a plane I mean specially if it‚Äôs cannabis ..  so anyway I had to confront the situation and walk back to my seat . At this point I wanted to cry cause I knew I f***ed up bad. Security came and kicked both me and my gf out it was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. The worst thing is that this was a trip paid by her father and we were expected to be at the airport that night. Anyways.. security escorted us out of the plane. At this point I thought I was going to be arrested and I was having a full on anxiety attack. Thankfully this amazing woman that help us saw how shameful I was and left us off the hook by not reporting us. She told us we couldn‚Äôt ride that night but we could take an early trip that morning in a different state fml.. but at least she made it work. We had to drive to a whole other state over night with a rental spending an extra $150 on a rental  and missing a whole day of vacation because I HAD to get high... i was so sad this had to be one of my turning points where I realized that weed is not worth all this anxiety specially when you‚Äôre somewhere it ruins your fun and everyone else‚Äôs as well.

The only good thing keeping me from smoking every day is my social phobia, which makes it impossible to find dealers by myself. The only friend i have is the one guy who knows alot of people and can get weed. I more or less stopped hanging around my other friends because one of them often brings hard drugs to get togethers, and if i start doing that i am going to die. I cant handle pot, so how on earth am i going to handle harder stuff?
By some miracle i have managed to keep my smoking to around every other weekend and only one night at my friends place, making sure i dont bring any home with me.

Is was so bad that i managed to vape it all in one day. 

I dont know what i should do anymore though. My therapy is going nowhere because i am afraid of being honest with my therapist about my weed addiction, because i risk loosing my driving lisence, which would break me totally. Its the only achievement i have anymore. Cant find work even though i applied to close to 50 jobs in 30 days, and now i CANT work because of fear of getting sick with corona. 

A part of me just wants to give up, smoke my brains out and end it.",2,1

This is my first ever reddit post, I had to sign up as I just don‚Äôt know what to do in regards to my appetite anymore. 
A lil back story.. I quit 7 days ago and for the first 4 days my appetite was literally non existantand I survived just off of milk tea. I tried to eat but whenever I did I felt nauseous. On day 5 I thought my appetite was back but when I tried to eat a meal, I could only manage a couple of mouthfuls before I felt ‚Äòfull‚Äô. Now I know I wasn‚Äôt full as I hadn‚Äôt had a proper meal in 4 days so I just put it down to my stomach had shrunk and Thats why I could only manage a couple of spoonfuls. I‚Äôm really slim anyways (almost underweight) but the last week has made me loose crazy amounts of weight. My face has sunken in and my clothes are hanging off me. 
I gave up smoking to be healthier and happy but this is taking a toll on me physically and mentally and I‚Äôm so close to caving in just so I can have a good meal. 
I guess I‚Äôm looking for some sort of reassurance from you guys that it will get better and my Appetite will return soon. I just can‚Äôt see it yet and my thoughts of smoking are becoming increasingly stronger. 

When will the nausea go away and the appetite return if ever ? 

I‚Äôm so close to giving up on this but I‚Äôm determined to be weed free, don‚Äôt get me wrong I love smoking, Mary Jane was my escape from reality. My high to balance out the lows but I realise now that I was only masking and running away from my problems rather than facing them so that was a major push for me to stop. 

I‚Äôve smoked for over 10 years daily with no breaks so this new found sobriety is strange to me, I just want to be able to eat normally againüò≠",10,1

Things are still going well.  I had a minor bout of insomnia / restless sleep last week.  However, I think it was more due to stress at work than anything PAWS related.  My sleep has been a lot better these last few days.

I decided to go back and analyze all of my Fitbit data to see how smoking and sobriety have affected my sleep.   It was pretty cool to see how much my sleep has improved once I stopped smoking. 

Here's an updated [image](https://imgur.com/a/CF2ALrh) showing:

I know I should keep up but the craving is so strong,"Hi there. Kinda long post ahead so bear with me. Also sorry for spelling mistakes, English isn't my first language. 

I've been smoking for about 10 years, daily for 8 years. I've tried quitting before, lasted a couple days, then smoking just got worse to the point where I just don't feel anything appart from sadness and intensified dark thoughts. I'm already struggling with depression and anxiety, and it didn't help very much aside from rolling myself into laziness and the thought of not being able to do / deserve better.
I actually managed to quit for a solid week just before quarantine, but sharing a flat with no outside (balcony) with my best friend, who is also a heavy smoker with no intention to quit has made it impossible.

Flash forward to now, smoked yesterday and felt like complete shit the entire day, dealing with intrusive thoughts and existential crisis. Woke up today and told myself I would not smoke since it is mother's day and I want to fully enjoy the day with my family (I am at my parents' house for the weekend), and it's been going well. Now I find myself craving for some. Told my sister it's been 24h since I last smoke, she laughed it off saying ""so what? You're gonna crack one when you get home, it's not like you're stopping"", and I'm at that point where I know I shouldn't, because really it brings only negative stuff, trying to chase that comfort high, and at the same time it was sudden, unexpected and I'm doubting about jumping that leap of faith. I know I will go home in a couple of hours and my siblings will smoke, and I'm going to want to do the same. 

Also this sub helps me so much, I find myself in a lot of these posts. And deep down I think I already know the answer, I just don't know if I'm capable of resisting it. Thank you for reading!",5,1

I stocked up big before all the shutdowns started and today I will smoke the last 2 bowls. I promised myself 3 weeks ago that I would stop once I ran out. This is my first time trying to quit though so I‚Äôm nervous and don‚Äôt know what to really expect. I‚Äôve read nightmare stories about people not being able to sleep, getting irritable, and extreme weight gain/loss. To be honest though it doesn‚Äôt sound too much different than how my life has changed since I started smoking. So I‚Äôve been using these last three weeks to slowly cut back on my consumption which caused my stash to last longer than I anticipated. 

From past posts in this sub, I‚Äôve taken away three main things I think I need to focus on to help me make it through successfully to the other side. Any tips are greatly appreciated!

1. Find a new hobby to enjoy sober. For me, my plan is to learn to play the guitar and also get back into shape. I used to play some instruments in school but have never learned the guitar or piano. I also loved working out before I started smoking. Since then I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen the inside of a gym or sweat on my body outside of walking the dog in the afternoon. 

2. Eliminate the ability to smoke. This is part of my slow weening off of weed over the last few weeks. It‚Äôs not readily available where I am at so I‚Äôve cut off communication with my only source left, smoked all the weed in the house, and after tonight will be shooting my collection of bowls, bongs, and storage devices in the yard with some friends. A pipe sitting on a stump at 65 yards should be enough practice for the day. 

3. Support group. This is something I‚Äôve struggled to find but I‚Äôm still working towards it. All of my friends want to continue smoking and I know this will be the hardest part for me. I‚Äôd never cut my friends off for smoking weed, especially since I introduced it to most of them. However, they‚Äôre all supportive of my decision and have promised to have my back and make an active attempt to not smoke around me or at the very least not offer when I‚Äôm there. Another part of this support is my own mindset. Just three years ago I had this determined and passionate mindset about everything; sports, work, love, school. I was the damn near the best at whatever I set my mind to. Now I don‚Äôt care about any of those and tend to think negatively about them all day and my performance has clearly suffered. I‚Äôll be starting therapy and meditation next week to discuss and dive into these issues to get back to my killer mindset and get my life back on course. 

Starting Day 1 tomorrow. I have a feeling I‚Äôll be visiting this sub much more over the course of the next few weeks. Wish me luck!",36,0

I was giving up on Weed many Times, Always by myself, and I Always thought, that support's group is die weak people. I don't think that anymore. And we as social creatures need people. 

So If anyone wants to quit, try These Meetings sometimes, they are really helpful.

I also understood some motives, why I smoked in the First place. I wanted be normal. And the truth is that smoking alone won't make you normal. And what is normal anyway? 
Maybe this time getting sober I have to accept me for who I am, and forgive myself for all the self-harm I did. 
I started to Look at this as weed seemed to be good solution when I was 14. And for sure it helped me in some ways at the beginning. I am from Home with Hidden pathology, I was being beaten Up, My father is a sociopath, my mum had problems with Alcohol and Depression. I was also bullied in school for some time. So then it was a good solutions: go back to having friends, smoke weed. 
I have to forgive myself, as I didn't have right example back then and Nobody reacted when I went into Alcohol and drugs. And I was just a child.

Smoking for 18 years Made me an addict, which I started to notice, when I started to Change My life to live on the way I want and to follow my Passion, which was 3 years ago.

I was Feeling Furious with myself, that I noticed this now and I've wasted so much time.

But Here am I. Still progressing. It is my way. What I can do now is try to live my life less chaoticallly and regain mental strength. It is Not Like everything is lost.  Although I Just turned 32, which makes me think, that I closed some Options for me already.

Solutions for coping other than keep smoking weren't available for me in the past. No I can See clearly, that there is No other Option, I have to find them, on which I AM good, and most important: I have to Stick with them.

I've found I have no motivation, sex drive or real direction in life and I know that if I carry on going I'm going to wake up at 40 in exactly the same position.

After about 7 years of (nearly) daily smoking, 21 days ago I decided it's time to quit for good. It's been going quite well so far with only minor cravings. As I am quite a fanatical football player (I play at a decent level) I was wondering whether you guys noticed any improvements in your sports performance after you quit smoking cannabis. I'm not just talking an improve in stamina, but noticeable all round improvements. I'm asking because it would be an extra motivation for me to keep this no cannabis thing going!

Lastly, this group is great! Reading your stories has really moved me and motivated me and I am proud at all of you who managed to quit, while I don't even know you. Keep up the good work!",2,0

Even if I hadn't smoked with them for more than a year and a half, I resisted that first spliff (also gave up on smoking since the start of the year). 

Until I eventually gave in when they started smoking the second one. Took it, inhaled 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 puffs, passed it and refused when it came to my turn again. 

I was ""high'' for maybe seconds, or minutes at most (used to have a strong resistance level from being a daily smoker for 4 years and a regular user for another 4 years), but not really. I think I was looking for some answers to some very stupid questions as well as reminiscing on some great past high memories, but I also did not want to lose the proud feeling that I was on a 210 days + sober streak. 

Now it's today and though I've had to resist thoughts of buying and smoking just to get 'proper high', I think I seriously wished last night had never occurred. 210 days. 210 fucking days and now, I'm back to Day 1. 

If you have stopped, and you are thinking of giving in, no matter if you are at Day 7, Day 31, Day 71 or Day 271...IT'S NEVER WORTH IT.

I've smoked since I was 17. When I met her, I was a chronic smoker. Every day, multiple times a day. We had a great relationship. Fast forward, we've now gotten our own apartment together and now she decided that she won't tolerate marijuana any longer. 

Throughout the years, she's slowly voiced her opinion about me using it. And I've done everything I can to compromise. I dont smoke in the apartment, I dont hold any paraphernalia in my apartment, when she sees me stoned, she instantly rages and becomes hostile. 

Today for example, we had a lot of fun. Everything was great. She went to bed, I told her I was gonna play COD and ill be in later. I smoke a bowl in my car, talking to my friend on the phone. She wakes up, asks where I am and I tell her.

Next thing I know, she's beside my car door. At 11:30pm. Yelling, ""you're a fucking loser,  dont ever talk to me again"" while I was on the phone. My buddy hears this, we have long convo about it. She comes back out, same deal. 

She says she sees me as a loser when I smoke and she hates seeing me that way. This is what can ruin our relationship.

My parents divorced while I was in high school (private school in the suburbs, popular group whilst simultaneously hating everyone - first girl to get suspended for punching another woooo), my dad was/is a ‚Äú-holic‚Äù; alcohol but mostly weed. Saw my first bong when I was 14 and knew what I was straight away. Hated that he smoked. He was really abusive to my mum and then transferred it to me when she left in the middle of her chemo for breast cancer (she didn‚Äôt leave me and my younger sister just moved down the road and away from my dad/marriage). Abusive to me mentally and emotionally. I hated my life but had school and other things to distract me and get me through. 
When I tried weed the first time I was 18 I never stopped. Chronic depression diagnosed going on the past 10 years. 300mg efexxor and now 1 month sober. I‚Äôm so angry and so sad - obviously everything‚Äôs I‚Äôve felt I‚Äôve buried in weed. I used to think it was so cool - thought it should be legalised and I can honestly say now that it should NOT. this has been the hardest and most rewarding month of my life. I‚Äôm so angry and mad at the world - I almost get pleasure seeing others struggle who I think have it better than me but at the same time I‚Äôd fight for anyone that I thought had it less than me. What does that even mean ... 

Anyway if you‚Äôre young and think it‚Äôs cool but know you have some struggles you need to face 
Weed is not the way. It only blocks it temporarily. Then it takes over your life. Then you‚Äôre known as the chick who smokes more than her dude friend and then you think THATS COOL. then you end up meeting strangers off the internet for weed. Then you realise you have no money and no friends coz you spent EVERYTHING on getting high. So .. don‚Äôt do it ... be happy get out there live you‚Äôre life make friends and memories. I can‚Äôt even remember all those ‚Äòfun times‚Äô I had when I was high ... all I remember is how shit I felt when I got home alone, blazed out of my mind and scared 

I‚Äôm in my second year of uni now - primary education so I can somehow relive my childhood. I get amazing grades and handing in an assignment is the best feeling ever! Everyone is different .. for me it took 10 years to finally realise how FUCKED I am/was... but now I can‚Äôt wait for my future

I started smoking with freinds, after a break up, I was 21.

I smoked for 2years, form day break to night. I dont remember anything from thos etimes, bar when I was drunk(so not high)

&#x200B;

First month, severe anxiety attacks, mental and physical withdrawals were excruiating.

Second month, spiralling crippled depression.

The next 13 months wree a daily battle of anxiety tormenting my brain from 5 minutes after i woke(I lived for those 5 minutes) until I slept.

Daily suicidal idealation.

&#x200B;

At 13 moths, a great job opportunity came up, and I threw my self in, what did I have to lose?

&#x200B;

Moved to london, left after 5 months. my brain was rewired, just like that, working tirelesslly, everyday to survive, I had forgot what my life had been.

&#x200B;

I have  a great respect for the danger, but I'm fully in control of my brain and its thoughts.

&#x200B;

I am now a pilot, I fly the merlin(never saught help, fear of medical records)

&#x200B;

Know that this pain, is horrfifc, and can last for a long time. But I am phenomenally better than before, My mind is secure, and I haven;t touched dope since the day I quit.

&#x200B;

The only advice I can offer to help, is put yourself in a situaton, where you are fully responsible for yourself, no help, no safety blanket, so you have to be proactive, thats what focused my mind, and saved me

To all pondeing, I had reached the end, quitting wa sthe only option, I was so scared of what it had done

Hope this helps, others said it did knowign even that bad, recovery is still there.

So this time I don't want to relapse. After my heavy use I AM Not able to smoke pot moderately. I return to smoking all day every day, it is Just a matter of time. I don't want to that anymore. Every spiral takes time, Depression and makes me feel groggy.

Now it is my first day without, cravings are coming, I feel like shit. My Last Smoking every day period lasted ""just"" 1,5 months after 4 months being sober, so I expect I will BE good around Tuesday. However, I AM Feeling Like shit now. Not able to do anything, except watching some mobiles, but it also doesnt give me satisfaction.

This time is different. I know that my life magically wont be Perfect (like i was daydreaming other Times I quitted), but I know it will BE better. I AM afraid. Today I skipped my friend's Birthday, because I have this stoner Depression + I am Not Strong enough to handle My friends partying.

At the start, I smoked about 0.25g maybe twice a week at night, if that. I'd always felt in control.

Once the quarantine hit, I started consuming weed (smoking and/or canna oil) almost everyday once my FWB (and ex-boyfriend) proclaimed that he wanted to be with me for the rest of his life. For context, we had previously broken up because he was still in love with his ex-girlfriend at the time, and it had come as a total surprise when it happened. The stress of history repeating itself was too much to handle. I ended up consuming so much weed on April 27th that I had my first bad trip ever, and ended up calling an ambulance because I genuinely thought I was dying.

I also know for a fact that it's affected my memory and I'm about to go into my final year of engineering.  The biggest stoner I know who's in my final year project group even quit last month in anticipation for this. I used to love having lively discussions with my friends, but I often use the excuse of being 'exhausted' due to my brain feeling like it's in a fog all the time. I also tend to cancel plans in favor of getting high at night.

I got food poisoning last Sunday which has made be involuntarily sober for almost a week. I meditate every morning and night, and have taken up yoga and drawing, but my mind and body are still screaming for me to get high even if I don't enjoy the feeling anymore. Since I've been using so heavily this past month, I'm trying to decide if I should just taper off starting with once a week, then once every 1.5 weeks, etc until I quit, or if I should just quit cold turkey.

Man, weed was my thing. It covered my pain, coped for me, let me know everything was alright. Dimmed me down into a shadow of what I am, what I will be. Super, ultra addictive for me, weed always tastes like more. I started smoking after my parents split at 14 years old, first year of high school. We were poor at the time, and my Mom was losing her mind, good times. I started to get beat at home, then beat at school. Bullying was horrible. Cried myself to sleep many nights as a young man. I tried weed for my first time during these formative years, but I didn't really get into it until later in the teens, and then full engagement in my twenties... Blissful escapism riding on the surge of psychoactive fantasies. 

 


Weed would show me things, great things, let me feel things... All for not, no gratification, ever. A deception which ultimately dulled my senses and stole some of my life. Now I'm taking it back.



Day 2, dealing with spastic emotions, nonsensical thoughts, a gnawing anxiety hits sometimes, so hard... Initial withdrawal is the real deal, but it's not super physical, very emotional. Thank God I didn't get into heroin.  I have it all. Except for peace, and everything is all for not without. For years weed has haunted me, hunted me, until now. Here's the deal, legit. I'm going to be accountable to you faceless dweebs and kick the shit out of my addiction, or fall face down in front of you all.

I've been smoking since I was 14, from 20 it became every day use, like literally I was stoned all the time. Last 3 years I spent smoking for some months and trying to smoke ocassionally, which ended up smoking all day, every day. Then I was off for 2-4 months to start again for 1-6 months. 
The life was much better when I was sober.

At first when I started to smoke all day every day it seemed to be good for me, I overcome my social phobia, I became less afraid and started doing music and live my way.
But after some time, it changes direction.

Now I can be productive and chillouted only for first days when I smoke, and then I become this mess, feeling guilty, Missing Agreements that I had with myself, depressed and not fullfilling my tasks. Today I didn't go to my friend's Birthday party, because I felt do depressed and unmotivated, that I just smoked another 2 joints. So now I have again this day, when I know it went to far, and I know that I smoked all my Weed, so I will BE getting clear. The vision of withdrawal scares me. I don't care about anything today Mixed with thinking about what a failure AM I.
Tomorrow probably also will be shitty. And I have some stuff to do. 

Anyway, I have to quit this. I cannot be moderate, I tried so Many Times. I cannot be productive anymore after that. I am Just becoming this emotionless Zombie. My art is producent rarely, as I just get stoned, my Training are postponed often because of the high and I feel disconnected.

So my life is a mess. This is the difference I feel when quitting now. And it will be a mess after I quit.
This is the difference that I feel. Last Time I quit I had this idea, that after I quit, everything will BE better. And yes, my mood was better. But the other things weren't magically fixed.
When I don't smoke I am becoming too intensive, usually. Like classical Extravert. I Stop thinking about what other people think and in a result I hurt people. And I AM still procrastinating, but in a more productive way, yet I am unaware of that.

It went all too far. I have to stop smoking again and Most important: believe that it will Help over some time. And Not give Up in this sobriety. Because what I did since I started to make t-breaks that Lasted for months was give Up on them. I felt so good that I just decided that I might try Weed ocassionally. i AM afraid I never would. That Part is scary also.

I think it started, because Weed Made me relaxed, yet present. Now I am too relaxed sober, and Weed makes me more present only If User in proper amounts and Not abused. But... I AM loosing Touch with right amount too quickly.

Today is my friend's Birthday. I know, that sober me isn't Perfect, but when i was sober, I will BE there, having fun with my friends.
Because for Last 1.5 months I was Smoking, I feel anxiuous and depressed to this Point that it is Kind of overwelming to go to local shop and going to this party scares me. 
So I just stayed home, got myself some booze to Fall to sleep and tomorrow it will BE Just A little, little better, but still hazy. But on Monday I might feel a little more Alive. Then some days after I might start enjoy again some Hobbies that I AM just too freak out to do now.",2,0

All of my previous attempts to quit have eventually failed. I‚Äôd really like to try having an accountability partner to get through this time, perhaps someone around the same age/in a similar situation as me. 

I currently live with someone who smokes all day every day. Having it around 24/7 definitely makes it more challenging.

the thing is i have quit before and know how good it feels. but i am unsure if it is smoking that makes me feel depressed or smoking too much. like is cold turkey the best way to go in your opinion? or is moderation possible/the best answer for a stoner such as myself?

Holy shit I haven't been so happy in a long long time. The funny thing is, I've quit for longer in the past and still felt absolutely miserable. But...

This time I did it with a support group (MA/Leaves). 
This time I did it with intention. 
This time I did it with no desire to ever smoke again. 
This time I cut alcohol too - it would always drive me back into the arms of weed.
This time I cut the people who wouldn't understand out of my life. 

I haven't had a single craving. The odd pang of - 'i should smoke a cone' when my friends inevitably were smoking in front of me, but it wasn't - 'i want to smoke a cone'. The former feeling is alot easier to ignore. The former is just the death throws of an old habit, not desire.

I'm now on day 3 no nicotine (us australians generally smoke weed mixed with about 50% tobacco) and its barely even a problem. My quitting muscle has been training for the last 30 days, and is getting stronger. I plan to keep flexing it until porn is gone too.

A week ago I posted a status update on my first week totally sober from weed. I was quite ecstatic and optimistic and thought quitting weed would be easier than I thought. 

The 2nd week was much tougher than the first. Cravings started coming back and I started reasoning in my head why it's OK to smoke up again.

Fortunately I was able to stop myself. I threw away all my weed and smoking equipment so buying a new grinder, lighter, papers, and calling up my dealer would be a long process that would make me feel guilty at each step. If I had all the ingredients for a joint in front of me I honestly don't know if I would have still remained sober, but here I am. 

But on the bright side, physically and mentally I am feeling better, sharper, and more aware. I remember the feeling I have end of the day knowing I had a productive day is better than smoking the dankest weed but accomplishing nothing. 

In parallel tomorrow I am seeing a therapist for the first time in my life to maybe further understand underlying issues that made me a weed addict in the first place.

I started smoking a lot of weed my Junior/Senior year of college. Eventually, I finished college and was smoking EVERY day out of a dab pen. Every day, sometimes all day. I eventually smoked on works at breaks, and smoked a lot before work. It didn't affect my work, but I was smoking 24/7 basically most of the time (6 months -> 1 year heavy use every day). Previous years were smoking at night or on weekends all day.

End of January, I got bad anxiety about my past. I dealt with some sexual abuse when I was younger and really didn't have anyone to turn to so I watched a ton of porn (introduced to porn by abused when i was 6-7 years old).

This led me to watch porn from that age into my late 20's (27 now) and something I wasn't proud of. Weed helped me mask these pains I had deep down, but Late Jan of this year, I broke down. I confessed to my GF (love of my life) everything I had dealt with my entire life from smoking weed, heavy porn use, seeing bad things from porn use etc. I made her a promise I'd stop watching porn (haven't watched in 4+ months and stopped smoking weed. The withdrawals sucked, but I got through them. But I had terrible anxiety about my past issues, and I've been speaking to a therapist to get past them.

I was doing great, but last week we decided to smoke for the first time and hang out. My highs were intense and quite honestly enjoyable but sometimes I had rushes of anxiety that I had gotten over the past few months but I pushed through them. This morning, we picked up a fresh cartridge and I hit it a few times and got insanely high. My anxiety sparked up and it was uncontrollable. I had the same BIG rushes that caused me to stop in the first place and I couldn't push through these mentally so right at this moment I'm in a dark place trying to cope.

Is weed the cause of my anxiety returning?

Anyone have similar experiences with dealing with stopping smoking after years for months, returning, and dealing with heavy anxiety?

Eventually I got myself out of bed, went for a walk, cleared my head, and killed enough time for the dispensary to close. Safe for the night.

I had said that was OK in the past, but I kept breaking into the stash so that strategy was unacceptable. She agreed if it's that big of a deal to me, we could get rid of it all. This is testament to why if there are negative influences around you, you have to cut them out until you get stable and sober for quite some time. It's just too hard to quit when it's readily available. I thought I could will power my way around it, but honestly addictions can be so outside of yourself that any amount of self discipline sometimes can't cut it, you need to change up your exposure to the product. I must have disposed of over $300 worth of weed and alcohol, but that cost is seriously nothing compared to the damage that weed has caused me. My life objectively seems great: married, 100k/yr job, college grad, 29...but I was so miserable every day. So unmotivated, and just disconnected from everyone, and all of my hobbies/work. I'd say things like ""The fabric of my reality is thin"" because I could see myself following through with suicidal thoughts or rage quitting my job and responsibilities. The first week or so of quitting, I didn't have any alcohol issues or withdrawals, only weed withdrawls and intense cravings all day. I got only 4-5 hrs a night of sleep for over a week, but work from home allowed me to take some naps during the day thankfully. I'd just lay in bed sweating, staring at the wall. I've found that the lingering effect of weed when you're not high is so subtle and powerful, it's what keeps us all in. We don't even have time to escape the haze if we don't take very long breaks or quit. I'm not quite fully ""out of the weeds"" yet though :P, but this is the best progress I've ever made by far. This is also the first time that I'd have to re-up if I want to do it again. I'd always rationalize that my life was fine if I'd go a few days without smoking, and I'd go back to it (in the cabinet). This time, I've gone long enough to break out of my cravings and lingering mental haze, and I realize how incredibly positive and motivated I naturally am sober relative to how I am when smoking daily. I'm still sometimes kinda toxic (always have been), but at least I don't hate life and am not having suicidal thoughts. Even if this very positive state doesn't last, it's an eye opener to how weed can put me in a spot that is so hopeless comparatively. It's not even just while high, the lingering effect lasts days and keeps you in its clutches, convincing you that you're the same off it as you are while on it.  It feels weird and self indulgent writing something so personal in nature, but I think it helps to communicate with you all. I love reading all of your stories and seeing similar results. It's motivating. It just shows that none of us are weak for struggling with addiction, we're all from such different backgrounds and can still get sucked in. I'm very grateful for this subreddit. Here's a summary of strong, noticable positive results I've had incase the above is TL/DR:



Some of the positive effects I've noticed from quitting weed so far:

-waking up in the morning with energy and not being groggy

-getting bored and subconsciously deciding to do something productive for fun, without having to force discipline to do the same task like I would while in the weed haze. Feeling like I have tons of free time to do what I want.

-1/10th as much anxiety around people in public, or around my friends

-very minimal stress when doing mundane tasks: I'd use to make a microwave dinner and be like ""OMG this is so much work!"", now I'm excited to eat something tasty

-being able to properly go on a diet: i'm not hungry constantly from the munchies

-paying attention to conversations with friends/family/coworkers without feeling like I have to force it, it comes naturally and is enjoyable

-visualization in my head of anything I want: I had lost my ability to envision things well

-a defined story line in my life: my memory works again, so I remember where I've been and where I'm going - I'm not stuck in a constantly resetting present state (I can still become present with meditation anyways if I want, even better than I could with weed)

-confidence in myself to overcome my internal problems

-The first week or so my mood was awful, now it's stabilized and under control. On weed i was just a slave to my high/emotions

-the overall feeling of health and wellness from not physically smoking anything",18,0

I'd be a trooper and power through that first month of withdrawal, but once I got through the hard part, I would feel a bit bored and disconnected from the process. 

Participating in the chat is like a group therapy. I get to talk about what's on my mind and listen to others. It's similar to what I do on this sub, but the difference is that it's in real time and gives me a greater sense of social engagement. It's nice to just check in and feel like you're part of something. 

I think that's what I've learned, that *I have to consistently participate in my own journey.* It's like watering plants in a garden. It's not a lot of work, but you have to be consistent to foster growth. Without participation the weeds take over and the beautiful plants of sobriety and personal development slowly become overrun by the weeds of addiction and self-loathing.

So I'm not sure how this works but just a few days ago I've decided to stop smoking weed, I have been smoking everyday since the covid 19 shut down (that's about 3 months) I've smoked almost all day and night, recently I've decided that I don't want to smoke anymore, it's been robbing me of my motivation. The first day of quiting wasn't so bad but the second day was absolutely horrible. I haven't slept in 2 days and my appetite is almost non existent.
The main problems that are coming up is cold sweats, insomnia, and stomach pains. Because of all these things combined, I end up getting some really bad anxiety, just a little info I already have generalized anxiety disorder, so anxiety is already a part of me, I am taking medication for the pills but because of my withdrawal these symptoms are making me freak out, I can't sleep, I can't eat... I'm honestly afraid... I dread the night time because I know I won't be able to sleep and I'll be awake all night! No, really! I will get about 20 to 30 mins of sleep and my anxiety will wake me up and have me awake for hours... I haven't experienced anxiety like  this in years since my last anxiety episode... thb I'm scared... I'm afraid... has anyone who already has anxiety have had to quit cold turkey? I'd love some advice that some of you have done to help with sleep and or eating? Thank you for reading.

***UPDATE***
So I went to my doctor's a few days ago and they raised my dose to 10 mg to 20 mg (I've been on 10 mg for 3 years now) and I feel as it's slowly working... I hope... they also gave me a new medication called ""Gabapentin"" the dose is 300mg and was told to take it 3x a day I don't know if it works tbh because I feel anxiety still but it does help me focus a bit... but so far I'm taking baby steps... I'm starting to slowly eat, and sleep is coming back but slowly as well... I hope to feel better soon...",3,1

My partner has used sporadically since then, but I have firm boundaries around his use - he can't use when at home or around me.

This evening after being out with friends he came home in a panic. I'd had a lovely evening on my own, relishing in all the activities that I love, and he turns up off his head in a bad trip, with paranoid delusions, alternating in and out of reality. 

I was literally nearly asleep and he turns up seriously needing me to help him get a grip on reality every few seconds lest he go into a full-blown panic attack. 

We are now 2 hours into his coming down and while he's nearly through it, he's been ranting and raving about everything under the sun, about all the revelations he's made about life and the universe (remember those, we thought we were goddamn geniuses with the weird shit we would come up with, only to realise it's nonsense when we are sober again).

I did not choose to be a part of a bad weed trip tonight. I made a conscious decision to remove weed from my life. Being taken along in a bad high that isn't my own when I had some horrible trips myself is hugely triggering and a stark reminder why I quit. I was immediately anxious riding the waves with him but I managed to get to the patience necessary to help him through it. We are know at 2:30am and he's coming out the other side to sleep. My nervous system is still so fired up that I can't sleep. 

I have now found another reason to become even more resolute in my decision to quit - I can't allow myself to choose for someone else by forcing them to experience my bad trip. I know I've got this and rest assured, I will be having some serious discussions with my partner about my newfound boundaries!

Now to meditate to soothe my frayed nerves so I can finally sleep.

Edit: a word

TL;dr I quit years ago, partner still dabbles, he came home in a bad high and now I'm helping him come down. It sucks. I remember why weed can't be a part of my life.",7,0

One year ago I posted this. I had my first NA meeting and was going clean. It‚Äôs been one year free of pot and alcohol. 

I was a daily smoker. Loved it. Never an excuse not to smoke. I took a year off from my high stress job and filled my days with clouds of smoke.

The first few weeks and months were the hardest because you have to get used to living your life without that crutch. I used to work my ass off knowing I would have that smoke at the end of the night.  Nothing beat that feeling of taking my joint on the deck, lighting up and melting.

The first week was restlessness and anhedonia. I waited everyday until it was early enough to go to bed and then stared at the wall. It felt like wearing an itchy wool sweater. That‚Äôs how uncomfortable wearing my own skin was. I couldn‚Äôt imagine not smoking with every activity. Softball, snowboarding..running. I couldn‚Äôt imagine not having that with a smoke for the rest of my life. It was scary thinking of how will I do that. I carried around a Just For Today keychain in my hand as a security blanket for the first month.

I joined a lawyers support group and that really helped as I went through the 12 steps.

Now....

I‚Äôm so much happier. I used to think weed helped me with anxiety. The opposite is true. Weed creates the very anxiety it cures. Since quitting, my mood is way more balanced and my mental well being has improved dramatically. My job is litigation so it‚Äôs stressful. What‚Äôs different is that I can manage it without going off the deep end.

I‚Äôm way more active and present in my relationships with my friends and family. I no longer retreat and ignore calls when I‚Äôm high. I‚Äôm actually there and it feels good. My social anxiety is far lower.

I really got into snowboarding and nailed 17 days on the hill, mostly by myself getting my ass up at 5:00 for fresh tracks. It was hard because I always used to smoked a joint on the lift.  Sometimes I still miss it. I would never have been able to do this while high all the time.

What I noticed about my getting high before is that the most enjoyable part is the full joint, the light and the first puff. That was the best part. Actually being high.....much less fun. My journal from the year before I quit had so many entries of me saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even like when you get high‚Äù

My favourite part is the feeling of being free from the cycle of smoke, high, anxiety, smoke, high.  My life used to revolve around that next joint. The next activity was planned around when that next joint was. I‚Äôm free of that cycle. I have energy for meaningful hobbies.

There are some smoker friends I don‚Äôt see as much anymore. My decision to get sober cost me the love of my life. He is a heavy drinker and when I got sober it was a change our relationship couldn‚Äôt handle. He is a wonderful successful person with many talents but as a sober person, being with someone who drinks a bottle and a half of wine a night and loves to party is not the right fit for me. It makes me sad that I no longer see the relationship for what it once was but now that I see it for what it is, I can‚Äôt unsee it.

People ask me if I will ever go back to having a smoke once in a while. The answer is no. I don‚Äôt have control over my consumption. One is too many a thousand is never enough. If I have one,I‚Äôll rationalize once in a while and then from there to once a week, and then once a night and I‚Äôll be back to regular habits. I‚Äôve run my relationship with marijuana into the ground. The best thing I learned in meetings is that if you have to work at controlling or monitoring your consumption, your already past that point of having control.

I made the decision to quit alcohol as well. I was never a solo drinker but I didn‚Äôt want to get out of one trap to fall into another. Quitting alcohol was harder socially because drinking is everywhere (especially in law). After a while people just stopped asking me if I wanted a drink. When I go to events I have Diet Coke in a wine glass. I certainly feel uncomfortable when I‚Äôm the only one it drinking at a heavy drinking event but my discomfort won‚Äôt be solved by consuming ethanol products. It will be solved by being ok with being me. Still working on it. The only one who really gives a shit is me. No one else is really that interested with their own lives to care.

I fell in love immediately and 100% got addicted. I gained weight, lost my girlfriend, got depressed, was broke all the time. Weed may or may not have been the cause of it all, but I definitely would have been able to handle it all better if I was sober.
Anyways, once covid started I got laid off and made the decision to reenlist to help out my state and get a little more order back in my life for one last 3 year enlistment.
I honestly wasn't sure if I could give up weed for 3 more years...but I'm glad I did. Just after 5 months sober I got a new amazing gf, landed my dream job, and am the most financially stable that i have ever been. (Working on losing the weight still).

I literally didnt have a sober orgasm in 6 months.

I had no trouble getting it up or maintaining an erection. Its just that it was like it wasnt there. I wasnt feeling a thing. Im uncircumcised so my penis is very sensitive but last night it was like it was numb. We tried again the next day but nothing.I tried masturbating but still no sensation. I had an urologist appointment who told me i look clean, we're still waiting for the results, but chances are slim that its an STD.

I am 20 and have been smoking heavily since I was 16. Sophomore year of highschool I was introduced to weed and immediately loved it. Coming from a family with strict parents I always had to be very discreet with it. Nonetheless I became a stoner quickly - started buying my own weed, got a bong, grinder, and so on and so forth. Anyway, here I am at age 20, hoping to quit once and for all. The thing about me is that weed didn‚Äôt get in the way of my achievements. I go to one of the top universities in the world, have a 3.8 gpa, finished 3rd in my class in high school, played varsity basketball for 3 years, and so on. I have noticed this is how substance abusers transform from an occasional blazer to a fully addicted stoner. Without it getting in the way of my achievements, why stop? Because I want to live a clean, healthy life. Ive noticed my memory has gotten substantially worse and that weed use ironically increases day-to-day anxiety (at least for me). I‚Äôm used to eating and sleeping while high, so this is what I‚Äôm mostly nervous about in regards to quitting. I have an impulsive personality and have failed to quit multiple times in the past. I am hoping that this thread will help me stay strong. I don‚Äôt need weed.

I‚Äôve been smoking everyday for the last 8-9 years I‚Äôm now 23. Yes it has been a full lifestyle for me. BHO, live resin, distillate, ‚Äúheady glass‚Äù. As lame as this sounds I was a connoisseur.

I‚Äôve decided to make an effort on trying to quit. This is my first time actually going to try and commit to it. I smoke ‚Äúquads‚Äù only around 5-7 tokes a day.

Going through high school I always had really bad depression and anxiety by the end of high school. I end up getting expelled due to weed. 

Finished highschool and graduated college now.

But Pretty much all my friends smoke weed but are somewhat active.

I don‚Äôt have a job and I am not active at all, I play video games. And I feel like I‚Äôm just not happy the way my life is going right now. I just want to give quitting weed a try.

The last time I took a Huge break was probably 4-5 years in I went on vacation where I can not get access to weed and I went to full detox mode it was not pretty . Had to go to the hospital *because of water sickness as well* ( drinking water from other side of country that I‚Äôm not used too.)

I still currently suffer from depression and anxiety on the Daily basis. More so anxiety . 

I really want to just reset my life get in shape get my finance right. 

I know stopping smoking weed doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll instantly become successful etc, But I feel like it‚Äôs going to help.

I‚Äôve been lurking here for about five days and I figured it was just time to ask some questions. I have been a daily user of cannabis for seven years with a few tolerance breaks here and there, up to a couple of months at a time. I decided that if I wanted to see the changes in my life happen that I want to have happen that it would need to go. The last month my flower usage became spliff usage as well, and a lot throughout the day. Everyday for a month.

I have a history of IBS-D (diarrhea prone, not constipation prone). I never used cannabis for symptoms though, almost always for meditation. I believe I quite cold-turkey on or about May 21st, so about 14 days ago. Aside from the horrible sleep patterns, extreme fatigue, lack of appetite, weight loss, and nausea, I am experiencing pretty severe watery diarrhea. I understand that all of these things are part of withdrawal but I sure am reading a LOT of stories of this passing within a couple of weeks at most for most people. I understand that Cannabis withdrawal can induce diarrhea in some, but I am curious, how many of you out there experienced this long-term? It starts with crazy gurgling and I will be woken several times throughout the evening running to the toilet and through the day, up to fifteen times per day. And the. On some days, decent stools. 

Today I decided to visit the urgent care clinic where blood was drawn and stool samples were made (looking for parasites). This is creating an unfounded amount of anxiety in a guy who is already always worried about his health. I have been on a high-fruit diet working to detoxify my body for about two years with lots of juices but I have never in two years experienced this. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to what foods trigger it. Some days my carrot soup digests fine, then other days it goes out the way it came in. Waiting for test results. Any input or experiences out there to be shared with me?

1089,2020-06-04 23:13:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gwwm9g/yea_me_too/,Yea me too,"Hi all,

I have a pretty typical story I think. Didn‚Äôt get into weed heavily until after college (or rather in between, having dropped out for a couple of years), and it gradually became a centerpiece of my life. I knew from early on that it could easily turn problematic for me. Self-control has never been my strong suit in any area of life, and here we are a few years later and any and all boundaries I had set for myself (rules are made to be broken) are in the wind. 

Quarantine certainly hasn‚Äôt helped - giving me infinite unsupervised time in my room is like giving a baby infinite candy. It‚Äôs not going to make great choices or feel great after. I didn‚Äôt smoke for the first month or so but was depressed and shut off. And I drank more than I ever have. So I didn‚Äôt exactly feel the benefits of sobriety. Then I started buying from my old guy again and it wasn‚Äôt long before I was stoned all day every day. 

Things are rough at work. I‚Äôm extremely lucky to have an interesting, career oriented job - something that if you‚Äôd told me would be the case a few years ago I‚Äôd have not believed you or broken down crying. But I‚Äôm close to losing that opportunity thanks to procrastination and denial. Weed didn‚Äôt cause those problems, I‚Äôve been struggling with procrastination for as long as I remember, but it certainly doesn‚Äôt help. It just helps me sit contentedly on the brink of crisis. 

I‚Äôve started seeing a therapist, a luxury I am grateful for, and he has been pushing me to address my problems head on and to shift my thinking. He hasn‚Äôt exactly told me to quit, it doesn‚Äôt come up often in our sessions, but the kind of personal change he is encouraging will be way harder to make if I‚Äôm stoned all the time. 

It‚Äôs been over a week since I ran out of my last batch and it‚Äôs been largely nice, unsurprisingly. I‚Äôve been more present with my friends, more productive at work etc. I‚Äôve drank a fair amount. I know there‚Äôs more to living your best life than not smoking, but it does seem like a prerequisite at least. I had about three months last year where I very deliberately quit cold turkey and that was great. Then I relapsed and it became a daily habit again. 

I texted my dealer earlier tonight. After sitting around agonizing about it I decided to call it off and look for support. I have friends who would be helpful but they have their own lives and I‚Äôve been so flakey with them for so long I don‚Äôt feel I can lean on them. This is easier somehow. I just wish I could moderate my smoking! I love weed, like goddamn. If I could have it in the house and just smoke a bit at appropriate times that would be amazing. But as of now it doesn‚Äôt seem realistic. 

Anyway, this got a lot longer than I thought it would. If anyone has read this then I really appreciate your time and attention. I‚Äôm hoping to stay active on this sub, even if it‚Äôs just journaling into the void, and to help others live their fullest lives (geez how lame is that). All the best.

Mostly because of shame ahahah I had been sober for 22 days before relapsing. I knew I was going to relapse. I was happy I quit, but I kept craving it. I told myself a cheat day wouldn't hurt. Then I cheated twice. Then after running out and feeling overconscious about borrowing smoke from my friends, I bought some for myself and left it at a friend's house so she would hold me accountable. Well, it didn't work! hahaha

I started smoking again just like I used to. Not the same amount as my tolerance hit pretty low levels after the initial 22 days, but after smoking every other day for 3 weeks, I could easily have 3 - 4 joints a day again.

I outsmarted myself this time! I bought a lot less than I what I normally buyt so now that I ran out again, I'm hoping to last longer than I did on my first attempt.

I was a regular smoker for 3 years. Can't quite remember a lot of the stuff I've experienced in the mean time. I reckon that weed was super formative and insightful in my first 2+ years of daily use, but now I think that being quarantined gave me a whole new perspective on it. Weed wasn't distracting me anymore, rather locking me up inside myself and forcing me to deal with certain feelings that just aren't productive. I was rumminating a lot, feeling anxious and lazy. It sped up my thoughts and intensified negative psychological patterns. It's just not THAT benefitial anymore, you know? Last time I started smoking cigarrettes again instead of pot. I want to believe that this time I'll choose working out or studying instead of other destructive habits.

I don't feel AS shitty as I felt when I first quit. I experienced withdrawal symptoms for about 3 weeks, couldn't eat, felt super sick to my stomach, my sleeping was messed up... Now that I'm on day 2 again, I can't complain much. Appetite is here, but irritability and anxiety are heartless bitches.

I'm glad I can turn to this place when I need to vent about my quitting experience. I'm here too to remind each and everyone of you who have relapsed and are feeling guilty and powerless: don't give up on yourselves. It's okay to relapse. It's okay to fall back into old habits. It's fine. Quitting is a process, you know? And not an easy one. Try to accept that we're all flawed, we make mistakes, we're only human. But also try to remain true to yourself and to your initial desire to quit. Honor your body and your feelings, respect them, CONSCIOUSLY say no to things that won't do you any good. Choose yourself rather than choosing weed. Choose to at least try to see who you could be without it in your life. And if you need to vent, just reach out! Thank you for reading this all the way through if you did. I wish us all success. :D",3,1

I smoked for 8 years daily and well, never progressed at all. I wanted to quit several times in the past, but always had the feeling that I'm missing out on something, or actual anxiety-feelings when I started thinking about quitting.

One good thing is that I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I'm at her parents house right now for the first time ever, and we made a deal that I don't smoke while I'm here. I agreed and want to do it. 
Well, I did it yesterday, woke up today on the sweatiest mattress I've ever felt, but I did it.

Well, fast forward to an hour ago, she was studying and wanted to go to bed. She looked at me and asked if I'm alright (got a weird look on my face when I'm distressed) and I felt that something isn't alright, despite the fact that it was a beautiful day.
I thought a little bit and said something like:
""Yeah, I'm kinda mad because you didn't really learn efficiently, which makes me sad because your wasting potential."" 

That got her really upset and she left the room.

While laying down alone I realized that I am distressed only because it's the second evening without weed.

I sneak it in holidays you name it she's been there. So firstly I quit the nicotine I'm 25 days in bought a vape pen used that which to be honest is OK but it's not the same as a joint and a brew. So now I'm quitting the weed. Iv gone from smoking a shit load a day to basically one Myne two joints worth in the last week. Last two nights iv not slept in sweating and today feel a bit impatient with people. My plan was to taper off just to avoid loosing my mind not sure if that will help but I'm so glad I have found her and you guys. Reading through some posts has made me realise its all normal.. We have got this. Just hope I sleep soon and not dream wierd I know my mind so these fucked up dreams are probably going to be extra extra.

There's just nothing else that numbs you out like that, and that can be so nice after a long anxiety filled day.
Normally I use the discord more but I missed the earlier chat and the next one is when I'll be moving.
I'm totally, totally going against that ""voice"" by even posting this. This post will decrease the chance of me relapsing (which is relatively high right now)...
It's the same old: well just tonight and you can start fresh tomorrow. 
Nothing else will be fulfilling in the same way as getting stoned.

My reasons for quitting are many and not lost to me, but addict voice can always justify why today it is deserved.

Long time lurker on this sub and on reddit in general. I just recently quit weed on May 5th, 2020, after smoking for about 8 years daily (and more than once per day), and the withdrawals have been absolutely wild. I've turned to this sub a bunch to know that the things I'm going through are normal, but after 30 days some of it the things I thought would start to subside seem to still be lingering.  


Mainly, it's anxiety and mood swings that have been the hardest to deal with. Feels like I'm always on edge. There's a lump in my throat, pressure on my chest, I'm cold in warm rooms, and I generally spend my time forgetting how anxious I am, then remembering once something even mildly serious comes up. I'm dealing also with splitting up with my partner, I think mostly because of my quitting weed as they are still smokers. I know this is best, as when you quit something it can be hard to keep the relationships that have otherwise been centered around whatever substance it is, but it could be something else that's escalating these problems.  


The other thing is the swinging moods. I go from real sad, to suddenly mad at the smallest and dumbest things, then back into a sadness that I can't crawl up out of. The desire to use is there, which I'm sure is normal, but I quit Alcohol on Feb. 2nd of 2019, so I know I can do this.  


I guess, my question is, is this all normal for withdrawals after smoking this much weed? I panicked today like crazy and started to reach out to psychiatrists and psychologists who have kinda tried to bounce me towards narcotics anonymous or substance abuse treatment centers, who have kinda bounced me on back to the psychiatry world. I'm afraid to start taking some kind of pill, feels like it would just be switching one vice for another, and feels like I know I have the power to get through this without that.  


Any advice is really appreciated, thank all of you for being out here helping people with this, it's not really something that is readily known about and I feel pretty lost sometimes but I check back in with leaves and at least I know there are others out here doin' this.",8,0
1106,2020-06-04 12:33:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gwkv4j/1_month/,1 Month!,"Was a daily smoker for the last 2-3 years. I actually decided to stop bc I had an internship coming up this summer (its remote now) and it wasn't clear if there would be a drug test or not. I had so much trepidation leading up to that day of finally boxing up my whole stash, duct taping it shut and throwing it in the back corner of the closet. I honestly didn't know what was going to happen or what kind of state I would be in 7 days later.

&#x200B;

I had been using throughout grad school as a way to ""cope"" with all of the daily stress and anxiety I'd been feeling. Classic story.

&#x200B;

The ironic thing that I see now in retrospect, is so much of that stress and anxiety was being brought on by the fact that I couldn't remember shit, on a day to day basis. I had unconsciously made the decision that I would prefer to float through grad school aloof and not really connected to any of my research projects that I was supposed to be making progress on.

&#x200B;

After the first week without taking any weed, I was SHOCKED to see just how much of a fog had been lifted off of me. My short term memory came back, I started having really vivid dreams again (and still do!) and I was finally able to think at the kind of level that my work kind of requires if you really want to make sustained progress.

&#x200B;

I had been sitting on the data for this paper, and hadn't been writing it, for probably at least a year, maybe more. In the lats 30 days, with nothing to do in quarantine, I've essentially been able to bang the whole thing out and should be ready to submit to my advisor within a day or two.

&#x200B;

It's amazing what you can get done, when the mid afternoon approaches, and you don't have thoughts like ""I've worked hard today, that should be a wrap on things, time to smoke!"" 

&#x200B;

When you realize that you've got so much more to live for than just getting high, its a special kind of breakthrough, and I'm writing this in hopes of encouraging others, if you've only made it a day or week, it absolutely does get easier, you've just gotta hang in there, and keep building those tools and reasons, for why your life is better without weed in it. As you accumulate enough of those reasons, you'll just get more resilient to those urges, and at least for me, that's whats made things easier.

1110,2020-06-04 11:07:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gwj7nf/day_1_again/,Day 1 again,"I had made it almost three months without weed. I was maybe a day or two shy of that auspicious marker of time. I was feeling so good and so confident. I had made it through all of the quarantine crap, been sitting at home alone for days on end‚Äî what would have been the perfect time to just get high and let the time fly by‚Äî and I didn‚Äôt give in. I stayed home and stayed safe‚Äî thinking about keeping my lungs as healthy as I could. I moved, in the middle of a pandemic. A move I had been waiting on for months, for years, really. And during that move, I found the pipe I had hidden, just in case. And I found all my old weed bags with little scraps in the bottom and jars of ashes, with some good stuff still mixed in a little. . . i managed to scrape together one bowls worth, but didn‚Äôt have anything to light it with. So I stuck it in my pocket and took it to my new house. But not in the house. No, this new house, this new start, I wasn‚Äôt bringing weed in there. I wasn‚Äôt going to have those associations with this new house and this new life. So I found a place outside to store it. 

Then, a very stressful day or two later, I found some matches. And it was late in the evening, the kids were already distracted by their screens, what would it hurt? One little bowl made of scraps and not quite burned ashes? So I smoked it. It felt so good. I felt creative and energized, excited about my new house and how I could really make it feel like me now. All my old stuff just didnt go anymore in this new space, and I wanted to start a hundred different projects all at once, I felt so good.

And that‚Äôs when it happened, really. When I quit quitting. When I had the thought, ‚ÄúI could probably handle smoking just a little in the evenings. If I can keep it to that, it‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt consider the moment smoked that bowl when I failed and quit quitting weed. It was the moment I had the thought ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs safe for me to smoke again.‚Äù I smoked a couple of other times during those three months. First, a couple of weeks after I initially quit, I got some shitty, disappointing news that sent me into a state of utter depression. I could not stop crying. I barely functioned for three days straight, until I finally made the decision to get some weed and smoke because anything that was going to interrupt the pattern of that level of depression was going to be better for me (and my kids) than me being non-functional due to depression. I got weed. I smoked it. I was able to get enough of a seratonin kick to my brain that I was able to better process what was causing my depression and see a way to move forward. And I continued on, without smoking again, without ever changing my thought process that I had quit weed ‚Äî more just accepting that I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwhite knuckling‚Äù it and I had done my best to ignore the cravings, but in that moment, it honestly felt better to smoke, feel better from the depression a bit, and then gather the strength to keep moving forward, than to just keep staying 100% clean.   


I had one other moment like this. One other moment when I broke down and smoked, but didn‚Äôt give up quitting. It wasn‚Äôt as strong of a need as the first time. I don‚Äôt really remember what set me off to smoke that time. . . Maybe a mixture of curiosity, anger, depression, loneliness. Afterward, I felt like it was clearly a huge waste of time and money, and I was so glad I was done with that crap.

And then a couple of weeks ago, when I lost this particular battle, because of course, the smoking did not stay to just the hours of the occasional evening, like I told myself it could and would. By the very next day, there was an excuse of a reason to smoke at 2, just this once. And then, the next day, to smoke with my coffee in the morning, because I had always loved that first early morning bowl with my coffee and I was gonna be gardening all morning, and really, what is better than gardening high?

But by then, I was worried about that the neighbors, my brand new neighbors I haven‚Äôt even met or spoken to yet, we‚Äôre getting annoyed by the smell, and judging their new stoner neighbor. So I took it in the garage. Not all the way into the house, but an attached garage come close enough to breaking my rule of not in this house. And by then, I knew I had lost. I knew this wasent keeping it to reasonable usage. This was right back to out of control addiction. But by then I didn‚Äôt care. I knew I would get my act back together . . . tomorrow or the next day . . . but today this felt so good . . .

And I backslide. I backslide not just on smoking weed, but I backslid on how clean I keep my home, already difficult in a move, I backslid on how much and how well I connect with my kids. I backslid on my diet, and on my hygiene care, because I do get so sleepy in the evening, when I‚Äôm high. I backslide on my school progress for my certification program, which I am now somewhat at risk for not being able to complete. I backslid on progress for making an decent income of my own, and on being on top of communicating with people about important things. I delayed responses until people gave up on me or asked what was up? Why had I stopped talking to them?

Two or three weeks ago, I felt great about my life. I was finally moving into my dream home with my dream garden. I felt more secure and solid in regards to my relationship with my kids than I ever had, and I felt hopeful and determined about getting my certification done, and the couple of ideas I had been kicking around about how to make an income. I had lots of energy. I felt about as great as I have in years. I didn‚Äôt even feel the littlest need for that weed. My cravings had all but disappeared. It was almost more curiosity that made me smoke, or daring ‚Äî to prove I could do it and then go back to my life.

But once I smoked, once I had that momentary thought of that I could handle this every now and then . . .two or three weeks have disappeared, and I‚Äôm not really even sure how much time it‚Äôs been, just that it‚Äôs been too long. I‚Äôve spent too much. I‚Äôve wasted too many opportunities. I‚Äôve told my self too many times, this is it. I‚Äôm really done now, all while knowing it still had its grips on me and I would be finding my way to the dispensary later that day. I hate that I brought it into this new place, although at least I kept it to the garage. I hate that my kids must have smelled it, and that I feel like I can see them seeing the difference in me these last few weeks . . . That they‚Äôve pulled away a little bit, because what is the point of trying to be too close to a spaced out mommy. I hate that I wasted precious time when I NEED to be getting my training sessions done. I hate the waste of time and money and opportunities. I hate the list of calls that I put off, because it‚Äôs too hard stoned. I hate myself for falling into that trap again, and dragging my kids down with me. I hate the red crab sand box in my front yard that I was too stoned to manage to arrange to get rid of for free on Craigslist. I hate how disappointed I am with myself.

So, today is day 1, again. The little pipe I had kept, just in case, fell and broke . . . I still managed to use it for another day or so, but it‚Äôs now in the trash. It feels like do or die time for me now. If I don‚Äôt get my act together now, and start seriously moving forward with my training, with my job prospects, I‚Äôm done for ‚Äî especially in this economy. And I can‚Äôt afford to keep smoking the way I do. It‚Äôs just too expensive. And most of all, I can‚Äôt afford to lose anymore of my or my kids‚Äô lives. They are too precious to only be vaguely there, vaguely aware of what is going on. I experienced three month of being a better person and a better parent. I don‚Äôt want to give that up to weed. I wish I could have the last three weeks back, erase this mistake, but I can‚Äôt. Just gotta start again from here. Day 1.

If you are having any of these feelings, remember it's ok to feel them.  Don't criticize yourself for feeling them, don't feel guilty.  Don't repress the bad feelings, let them happen and accept them.  I have refused to acknowledge and accept bad feelings for so long I don't even know how but I am trying to learn.

I want this to be a philosophical, thought provoking story for me.
By having said this, i‚Äôd love it if anybody reading this could use it to reflect on their own life and their own problems and preferably use it to help themselves. 

I will divide this story in a couple of chapters:
Ch. 1 Who am I?
Ch. 2 How did i get introduced to smoking and how was my life like?
Ch. 3 When did i realize i have a problem?
Ch. 4 How did i quit?
Ch. 5 How do i see my future?

Chapter 1
First of all, i‚Äôd like to explain who i am. My name doesn‚Äôt matter, currently 18 years old and i have just graduated my high school. Next year (septemberish) i will be following a beta-gamma bachelor at the university of amsterdam. When I started to write this story i‚Äôve been clean for a little more than two weeks, i smoked my last joint on the 21st of may. After many attempts of trying to quit and moderating, this is the first time i feel really confident about it. I‚Äôve got an amazing supportive girlfriend who supports me like crazy.

Chapter 2
I got introduced to weed when i was around 15 years old by some friends i made on my new school. At the time i was a loner who never really fitted in with anybody until that point. My new friends who i still speak a lot and i got comfortable with each other and we bonded over marijuana in particular. We just smoked and smoked and had some good laughs. Some of those friends dropped in ‚Äòlevels‚Äô of school because of smoking and some, like myself, stayed in our quite high education even though we started to smoke almost every day and even in the breaks. We started smoking on school because it was fun and nice and we were bored every day. At the time my grandparents became very sick, my grandma had mls and my grandfather alzheimers. I believe smoking made me ‚Äòforget‚Äô my problems.

Chapter 3
I‚Äôm not sure when i realized i had a problem. The thing i do know is that when i started rolling my own joints i started smoking out of my room from time to time, wanting to have a last smoke when i get home after smoking with friends. My ex-girlfriend told me i had a problem and said i just wanted to get high always and told me i had to stop. I couldnt. I told myself i could moderate but as most of us know: it‚Äôs just a lie you tell yourself when you‚Äôre high and after the high you forget it. I started by saying i‚Äôd only smoke on weekends or special occasions, made arrangements with friends to quit for a month but i‚Äôve never actually been able to quit for a month until i got together with my new girlfriend and i‚Äôve been able to quit for a month. This month was horrible because i was just waiting to smoke again and i fell right back into my addiction after it. The main thing me and my friends did was get high and smoke more. My whole personality was based around marijuana which i felt really bad about. The last couple of months i felt like i got psychotic, not sure why but i had some weird af thoughts and convinced myself i started to get psychotic more and more. Even though i thought this, i couldnt quit. The negative effects i noticed were being really antisocial, not communicating, not being fun, being really slow, forgetting a lot of things, being a really lazy fuck and for me not dreaming was something horrible because i‚Äôm into lucid dreaming so much. 

Chapter 4
As i said i‚Äôve tried to quit for quite some time now, tried moderating it but it just didnt work out. When this corona shit happened i started working out quite a lot which i really enjoy but i was scared that i‚Äôd smoke a lot again since i did smoke a little less. The week i quit i smoked monday, tuesday and wednesday and i promised my gf i wouldnt smoke thursday but... i guess you could all guess where this is going. I felt so bad about it and when i woke up i started lurking around this subreddit. I read one post about losing a twinkeling in your eyes when you‚Äôre a heavy smoker, the next thing i did was look into the mirror to see the dull looking guy back to me. When i saw what i had become i felt disgusted, not worthy of my amazing girlfriend and i started crying the hardest i‚Äôve done since i started smoking. It was that point when i decided it‚Äôs been enough and i had to quit for a really long time. The first two days were horrible, not because of withdrawal, but because i was drinking with friends who smoked weed all night. The first night i somehow managed to stay away from it but the second i had given in, the old a really small joint excuse. I asked my gf if it was okay because i knew it wasnt, she told me to stay strong and she supported me and was so happy for my realization the day before that i stood strong and declined the offer of a joint. From that point on i‚Äôve been around stoners a lot without ever having the crippling urge to smoke a joint. I feel like it‚Äôs been too easy since that point but my cravings are just gone it even makes me tear up when i think about how easy it‚Äôs been from that point onwards...

Chapter 5
The future for me is still somewhat unclear. I believe i don‚Äôt want to smoke just purely for smoking anymore, i dont want to just get high. That said i have two trips planned with friends, the first one we want to get on a boat and have a good time. I‚Äôm not feeling like bringing any marijuana because it wouldnt be necessary at all for me, my friends will smoke but i‚Äôm fine not smoking that trip. On the other trip we will rent a house and make a three day bender: the first day drinking ( i won‚Äôt need any mj), the second day/night we‚Äôll take ecstasy and the last day we want to smoke out our ecstasy hangover. As of right now i‚Äôm thinking about getting half a gram of hasj and half a gram of weed to smoke while my xtc-trip and whatever i have left for the day after. I‚Äôm happy with the feeling i have right now because when i‚Äôd still smoke i would get 5 grams minimum for the 3 days. I‚Äôm only scared to fall back into the smoking habit when i do smoke. The trip will be around 6 weeks after quitting so i will definitely see how i feel about it then.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, i‚Äôd like to thank you for spending your time reading my story. Feel free to leave a comment or question, i‚Äôm down to answer anything i get asked. 
Writing this made me feel somewhat better about the decision to quit since i did tear up quite a lot.

- Talking to someone means sharing things that you think and feel

- No matter how much you think about how someone will respond you won't know unless you talk about it

- Even if you feel like deleting everything you just wrote 

- If you think about your feelings instead of smoking you can work through them

- Emotional dishonesty is very easy and comfortable to slip in to but you will always feel worse after

- You have a tendency to fawn. My best guess after a little therapy

- You don't have to be constantly talking or entertaining someone for them to like being around you

- Matter of fact, people who constantly talk are draining to be around. Even if you like them 

- A good nights sleep is the best thing you can do for your mental health 

- Feelings of self disgust normally go away when you shower and clean your room

- Shoving everything in the closet isn't really cleaning and no matter how much you smoke it's not going to empty itself 

- An attention span should normally last 20 minutes. You fidget around the 2 minute mark normally

I broke down in tears for 20 minutes and cried my face off.

I have smoked weed almost nonstop since I was 14 years old, and I'm now 25. I also am a mom to a toddler who I love to pieces. I never smoke anywhere near my daughter, but I go outside every night and smoke. This is the way I have been falling asleep since I was 14, except for a few periods where I've had to stay clean for a few months at a time, which included my parts of my life before being a mom, and during the entire pregnancy, which I am proud of. So, I know I can do it. But there are times when I'll slip into the bathroom and hit my wax pen (not often but if I happen to have one) and then be a high, zombie, distracted, mentally absent, easily triggered parent in front of my baby girl. My family is always very loud and sort of stressful to be around, including for my daughter. They don't have a filter sometimes. My excuse for smoking and being with my daughter is that I'll somehow be more fun while we play, and more relaxed so ""better"" able equipped to deal with the usual moments that moms get stressed over. But, when I smoke during the day, I cannot control it. I can control it at night, but I WANT TO STOP. This is not in any way meant to endorse mod management, I just needed to include all the details (sorry, ex-Computer Science major).

Speaking of which, I have also just graduated from college summa cum laude with honors, and have a really good degree and the potential to get a really exciting job which will support me and my daughter.  I got through college high. I always smoked before, during, and after class. I found my classes more interesting when I was high. I somehow was even able to code while high. 

Up until now, my mom has been paying for things to help me with my daughter and I feel like a loser because I was in school and couldn't contribute to my own child. I also acknowledge that not many people are given the opportunity to pursue school, especially under similar circumstances, and I acknowledge that I'm a literal asshole. But I want to take control. I want to move out. I want to give my child the best life possible. I want to be prepared to accept a job offer.

My family who I live with want me to stop smoking, with the exception of my sister close to my age who smokes all the time. She is my best friend in the whole world, and people tell us we share the same soul. But she is also my smoking buddy. Although I know she would support me quitting, I don't think she has any intention of stopping, and I don't plan on telling her what to do. My mom and my other sister are very judgemental in general so it's hard to talk to them openly about how I've been feeling; they support me smoking but aren't empathetic, it's more of an ""I told you so"" situation.

Me and my daughter's father are also very cordial. We broke up before our daughter was born because I found out he was cheating on me. However, I felt the need to go forward with the pregnancy. The same thing happened to my mom and she also felt it was her duty to help me raise my baby as her mom did with her. Me and my daughter's father have not had sex or done anything since shortly after she was born, I am not dating anyone, not interested in dating, and I don't want to have my focus on anything besides my career and my daughter. But my daughter's father, like myself, is also a huge pothead. He also currently lives at home with his family, who is very sweet and does not take drugs (they drink occasionally but I've never seen them out of control. I pretty much lived at their house when we were dating).

We are usually pretty open and on the same page about our daughter. Coming from her mother and someone who is not the least bit emotionally invested in him, he never puts our baby in danger. He cheated on me early in the pregnancy, but I forgave him enough to be civil and raise our daughter back and forth between our houses, but individually. We still chat and are friendly and sometimes even smoke together when our daughter is out with other family members. Still, I certainly would never consider getting back into a relationship with him. He was very toxic in a relationship, but since I've decided to withhold sex from him, he seems to respect me lmao. ANYWAY, he usually offers me free weed when I drop our daughter off at his house. So I'm smoking someone else's weed basically. I usually accept it and then go home and do work/write code and smoke at night. He usually ISN'T on the same page as me with quitting. He'll throw excuses at me like ""you can use fake piss"" or ""you don't even smoke that much.""

And on days like today, I get a burst of willpower big enough to consider quitting. But at the end of the day tomorrow, I'm going to crave weed again.

I just know I could be so great and do better. I want to stop. But I am so stuck in this stupid old habit of mine. And then when I want to quit weed, that's when I usually pick up smoking cigarettes (also started at 14 but quit when I found out I was pregnant) or vaping, which leads to smoking cigarettes. And then I am at war with myself: cigarettes vs weed, which one is worse? Not to mention being irritable, manic, dull, anxious, stressed, and paranoid. I always expect my high to make whatever I'm doing feel more fun, but I usually end up regretting it. I've successfully cut out smoking before completing my job search tasks done for the day, but I know deep down that 's not enough. To solve everything, I must quit. But for me, it is so fucking hard to leave it behind. Weed has been the cause of, and the solution to, the problems I keep facing.",2,0

I've noticed that I don't really have the same affects as other people when I smoke. I don't really like eating or sleeping when I'm high and I really enjoy studying and going to class high because it makes it a lot less boring. I also loved getting high and cleaning things. I've never really felt like weed affected me negatively nor positively I kind of just do it. It may have helped me get to class and get through the day sometimes but thats pretty subjective as it also made me really shy in class and I didn't ever make friends in class as a result (not that I really wanted to). So I'm kinda calling it a wash with that. It had become like smoking cigarettes. I would wake up and smoke a little bit without getting really high and it would make me feel a little less depressed and a little less bored, especially during the quarantine. Same thing when I get home from class or work or after my family goes to sleep. My sister has been calling it my vitamins.

I realized that its kind of just a waste of my time and money awhile ago but that didn't really stop me. 5 days ago I was hanging out with some non smokers and they freaked out when I told them I had some weed with me and told me not to bring it so I was like alright let me go smoke in my car real quick. I came back and they were like dude you smell terrible and they were looking at me like I was some kind of junkie. That was the last time I smoked. 

Ontop of that Im tired of dealing with addiction in general. I've been addicted to nicotine sex and weed for far too long now and for way to long I've wished I wasn't. Each one having its own sort of negative affects on my life. Its not really about weed hurting me as it never really felt like it has it's just about me wanting to have absolute control over my life. Its felt like everything I do is just a compulsion or a coping mechanism to deal with being depressed and I'm just so tired of it. I haven't smoked in 5 days and I don't really feel particularly great but I also know that smoking isn't going to fix that. Last night I had a dream that I was an addict laying in bed on some kinda weird drug IV and my mom was bringing me food telling me how I had fucked up my life and that really scared me. I don't know if it has anything to do with quitting weed but my sleep has been all sorts of messed up since I stopped. However that also used to happen sometimes when I was smoking so who knows.

I've been trying to dial back my nicotine addiciton too and I'm hoping to slowly get off it, it feels like not smoking weed has helped with that because I tend to vape more when I'm high. 

Something I've noticed is that it seems a lot of people on this subreddit who probably smoked the same amount as I did had a lot more issues with weed than I do. I've read about people feeling like they've been in a daze for the last few years, destroyed relarionships and how they've had withdrawl symptoms that sound more like they were addicted to opiates. I really can't relate to any of that stuff very strongly. Sometimes reading stuff like that makes me feel like maybe theres no reason for me to quit because I wasn't seeing the same negative impacts as others. But ultimately it comes down to the fact that weed isnt making me happy and its not making me a better person so why am I gonna continue to upset my family and waste my money doing it.

Definitely got a long road ahead and I know that quitting nic is gonna be the next step which will definitely feel worse but I think I'll be a lot more happy to drop that habit than weed. As theres a lot less I will miss about it.

Anyways if you read through this whole post I hope you found it introspective or valuable in your journey with addicition or even just entertaining in this boring time. Good vibes and good health.",7,1

This wasn‚Äôt my first attempt to quit, far from it. I‚Äôd been trying for at least 5 years. I once made it 145 days and have had a few 1 month long streaks. 

I‚Äôve used the momentum from this to also quit vaping (250 days), quit coffee (60 days), and my prescription to Vyvanse (18 days). I‚Äôve been abstaining from artificial sugar the past week so I guess you could say i‚Äôve just had my first substance free week in decades.

It really is worth it. There are still hard days, but nothing like the beginning. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling to feel level throughout the day, without the false highs and true lows. 

If I can give any advice, it would be that you need to replace your bad habits with good ones, but don‚Äôt try to conquer the world in a day. Start with things you enjoy (reading, painting, tennis, etc). Keep your mind busy on productive things. You‚Äôll have off days, but just treat yourself with kind patient love. Some days you won‚Äôt feel like doing anything, and that‚Äôs okay. As long as you make it through that day sober, it was a day well lived.

Once you‚Äôve got some momentum, build up to habits you don‚Äôt necessarily enjoy, but are good for you. For example, I‚Äôve also made my bed every morning for the past year, I‚Äôve been walking 5 miles a day for the past few months, and I‚Äôve been taking cold showers for discipline for the past 40 days.

You‚Äôll find that once you start to improve areas of your life, other areas will fall into place as well. You‚Äôll start eating better and taking care of yourself in all sorts of ways you didn‚Äôt realize you were neglecting when you were busy getting high. 

I don‚Äôt have any great wisdom for you, except to say never give up trying to succeed. All failures are apparent, not absolute. And with every failing you learn another lesson, like adding rungs on a ladder of success, enabling you to reach further next time. If you truly will to, with a firm resolution, you will succeed in your goal.",161,0

I don't not give a fuck either, I just check out and do way too much screen time and wait for the night to be over.

I started changing my bedtime routine AROUND the weed. ""Well I guess I won't do stuff that requires \_that\_ much brain power."" and I just watch useless shit and waste 6 hours a night before crashing at 2 (or later). Weed never even helped me sleep, it's just been such a deep habit. Therapist said I sound depressed right now (honestly how can you not be), and suggested diff meds, but I think first step is doing what's been on my mind for a long time and doing the deed.

Right now I get my meds through my psychiatrist, which costs more, or I can choose to get them through my PCP instead, at which point I'll have random pee tests. and if they come back dirty I don't get my meds. I've had this option for a couple years now, but haven't wanted to give up the weed. but god damn, now is the time. It just makes my brain cloudier (throughout the waking day too!), which is probably the worst part right now. I give less shits about my aspirations, and night time used to be like, really good. now it's just wasted. 

I'm a firm believer that a conversation about giving up something like this needs to include the benefits as well. and yeah, it helps me chill out and get away from the other shit in the world. i laugh easier, but only for the first like 3 minutes of the high. and it's not like, natural laughter. same way munchies aren't natural hunger and sleep isn't natural sleep. it all feels forced and artificial. it's comfortable cause it's what i've been doing for years. it can be a bonding tool with new people or friends. sex... can be GREAT, or completely detached. it feels cozy before bed! but maaaaan it's not worth the fogginess. i have some other sensory processing stuff and it makes all that shit go haywire. i'm bored of it, i miss having energy. i miss my critical thinking brain! i'm sure part of that is virus too but if the quarantine is already fucking with my head, why add more on top of it? if i don't have work and school (just graduated college, no commencement lol) to get my brain gears going, and i'm not reading for fun, whats the point of adding something else to not make my brain work? i'm just turning myself into a slug when i know i can have so much more potential. and i dont think just quitting will turn me into the person i want to be, but i don't think i can be that person if weed is a part of my daily life right now. 

i think one of the weirdest? most powerful? most fucked up? parts of this for me personally is that i haven't even been in love with the thing, ever. first time i smoked i was like oh my brain can't do shit it usually can. it was early college, i was like 20?? all my friends did it and no one was like ""hey if its not for you it's not for you."" and i didn't know i could say that to myself. but it also gave me really good bike rides, and i could journal out a bunch of shit i didn't otherwise, and hey, everyone else was doing it. it was just always like 40/60 good/bad times, if that. i'd try to quit, everyone would keep passing me the bowl, ALL THE TIME, and i would say sure. never really quit except for maybe a month throughout the past few years, but i have a weird relationship with it. it's like i act like i'm not a stoner but i smoke every night. but i'm like ""oh no i don't really like it though. i just do it."" it was/is deffo in control, not me. i was just along for the ride. plus i get socially weird, so i barely smoke with other people.

i think it was bad on my brain to keep doing something that i didn't really like, and it was definitely hard on my hobbies. bruh i miss falling asleep naturally. remember when you would just like, get tired?? and fall asleep??? what??!!!??!  

so here i am, missing my natural body cycles, missing my emotions, missing my sharp brain, missing the good alone time i can have before bed. the new life is just one email to my PCP away (and lots of self control), and now's the time. my original plan was just M-F to not smoke, and both those nights it was hard to not do it, but I want to prove to myself that I can, and I'm tired of the feeling of looking at my own actions and being disappointed in myself. so i'm gonna email my PCP this week too. it'll also be nice to be able to say ""nope, can't, i have pee tests"" and people won't push it.

but i keep coming back to like, the really good journal sessions i have. the good talks about real life shit with my friends. the feeling of a cool breeze on my skin when i go for that quiet night time walk. the real brain shift that gives me a different perspective on shit. there's some stuff i'm really gonna miss. but its not like i get that good stuff every time. and the difference between whether its good or not isn't the weed, it's whether i set myself up for that to happen or not. i'm so used to ""going with the flow"" but i think it's time for me to focus more on taking control of my own situation. which is kind of a scary thought!!!

thanks for listening. if any of this resonated with you, or you feel like you felt this, and now you dont anymore because you've quit, please let me know! i think i try to do things alone too much and i want to hear some supportive stuff. i miss being sober.",6,3

Days 1-2 were relatively easy for me, as I was keeping very busy to distract myself. Crossed so many things off that ‚Äúthings to do this week instead of smoking weed list‚Äù (highly recommend making a list like this). However, on Day 3 I woke up and immediately starting sweating like crazy, had some stomach issues, and generally felt SUPER irritable. 

Next obstacle was starting my period on Day 5, and having very painful cramps. This is when I really started to miss weed, as it was always my most effective remedy for period cramps. Toughed it out with some ibuprofen and a heating pad. Day 6 I hung out with some friends who wanted to smoke, I politely declined and they decided not to smoke in front of me while I was there which I was very grateful for! 

Now on Day 8 I‚Äôm still struggling with cravings, and I‚Äôm still having a hard time falling asleep at night, but I feel so accomplished. I feel free! And I‚Äôm loving the fact that I wake up most days and actually remember my dreams! My skin has cleared up, my room is clean, and I‚Äôve been all around way more productive than before.

I remember telling someone in the dream something like ""man I hit that pen hours ago and I'm still gone. My tolerance is garbage because I quit like a week ago"" and that dude was like ""me too""

I spent some of the dream wandering around an apartment complex trying to find what apartment my ex lived in so I could get back inside (*cause what's better than dreaming about getting back together with an ex right?)*. I remember riot police walking around the complex and me being afraid of them finding out I was high and I was doing that thing where you do your best to act sober and look normal. I remember being very spacey and struggling to express myself and knowing that they knew I was high but weren't saying anything about it and that if I took too long to find the right room that they would know I was up to no good. 

I somehow made it into the right apartment which was more like a hostel with beds everywhere and I was speaking spanish to two Mexican turds that lived under the bed (think mr. hanky....*se√±or hanky)*. I said *Que onda weyyyyy* and they were asking me how why a gringo like me knows so much spanish.

Anyways this shit had me laughing as the dream slowly came back to me in the first half of my day and I figured I'd share it here. 

I know dreams are usually nonsensical with hints of truth (like unresolved feelings of an ex, fearing police, or the fact im a spanish speaking gringo), but this one is probably the most bizarre I've had in a *long time.*

1157,2020-06-03 11:48:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gvwe6i/quit_recently_for_upcoming_drug_test_dont_even/,"Quit recently for upcoming drug test, don‚Äôt even miss it.","Hi everyone, grateful to be here.  I‚Äôm a 26 year old male and I‚Äôve basically been a stoner on and off since I first smoked when I was 19.  At varying times loved it, at other times it made me mentally and emotionally sick.  But in the past couple of weeks, I have been alerted to a great job opportunity, but I need to pass the drug test, and I‚Äôd rather do it honorably, so I quit.  And currently, everything is going marvelously in my inner (mental, emotional, spiritual) life, and upon several days of pros and cons reflections about it, I‚Äôm excited to keep weed solely as a part of my past.

I remember all the good times on weed, it felt like the perfect escape, like it completed me.  But from where I stand now, it was a childish farce.  Just me sitting around bopping to hip hop music that had nothing to do with my life.  Getting lost in colorful anime in a state of temporary bliss.  Gorging myself with soda and junk food, trying to make the pain go away.  Wasting my days away unconsciously being fused into my old futon.

Now none of these things are bad in moderation or in the proper space.  I still enjoy some hip hop, anime, junk food, or a relaxed afternoon on the couch.  But the difference is I‚Äôve felt a certain toxicity disappear from it.  What I mean by this certain toxicity is that before when I‚Äôd do things like that in conjunction with weed - if I got interrupted, or told I have to do something, or pulled away from it: I‚Äôd get fucking pissed.  I‚Äôd go into an entitled rage about not getting to spend my time high exactly as I wanted and planned.  Looking back at it now I want to slap myself across the face for being such a pathetic dick.  

Now some might argue that that‚Äôs more of a problem with who I am as a person rather than the burning plant fumes.  Perhaps they are right, and if so, touch√©.  However, there is a noticeable correlation in the way my moods are different since I quit.  I‚Äôm more responsible, keep better track of my shit, and if I get interrupted during one of my pleasure activities, I‚Äôm more prone to handle it more maturely and rightly as opposed to getting pissed and handling it poorly.  

Anyone can judge that however they like, but I‚Äôm going to move in the direction that is better for my progress into becoming a better human being.  And stoner me was not a good guy by hardly any stretch.  

So now moving forward, I have no plans to get off this ship nor do I see really any possible outcome where my personhood would shift to the point where I‚Äôll say to myself: ‚ÄúMan I should just smoke some bowls and get lit.  That will solve everything.‚Äù  It even grossed me out to think about it.  

For further clarity, a couple other points I do believe I should mention in regards to my inspiration for taking this new path in life: my spirituality and girlfriend drama.  

So as far as spirituality goes I have been an ambiguous fuck since around the same time I started smoking.  I was raised Christian and I was devout in my younger youth.  But it was mainly fear-based.  Afraid of going to hell.  Afraid of being ostracized by the people around me, who were pretty much all Christians.  Now I have a multitude of problems with organized Christianity, but I won‚Äôt segway into that phonebook of words here.  But while I was in college I let that go and wanted to rebel.  I wanted to sin and revel in all the debauchery that the Christian spiritual leaders tried to threaten me out of, and I did, as much as I could while I could.  But I also spent some sober time exploring different beliefs and faiths and found a lot of beautiful and some weird things.  

But as for now, I am trying to follow Jesus again.  Now before I get labeled a freak convert or anything, I am not overtly devout.  I can‚Äôt prove God exists and I certainly can‚Äôt advocate for the historical veracity of the Bible with a clear conscious, because it as a collection of books has far too many loose ends for me to be like ‚ÄúOh yeah, this book is totally inspired by a perfect God.‚Äù  Such statements cannot not be delusional to me.  

But I do believe in many of the standards Jesus set as a human being.  His selflessness, and effort, and sacrificial love move my soul in such away that it feels like a drug.  But it is not a drug that makes me irritable.  It is one that makes me want to do everything I can do to be a better person.  

One fear I have with this is that many Christians I know seem to enjoy self-righteously judging others who believe differently.  To them I say: Fuck you.  I know plenty of people who have found peace in other faiths or no faith at all.  And I say to anyone who has achieved any level of peace: Keep fighting the good fight, brother.

But I have never felt better about the spiritual progress within myself.  And to sacrifice that for anything would break my heart.  I won‚Äôt do it.

But now for the girlfriend drama.  I met her two years ago through work.  Started hooking up with her after a lot of build up last fall.  Became official BF-GF in January.  Things were still good for a while, but things have soured a lot.  We used to smoke together and be on the same page about most things.  But now it seems like the expanse between us keeps widening and widening.  I still love her and think she has a lot of good qualities, but nowadays it seems like the friction never stops.  

She still smokes a lot, especially with her best friend, and I don‚Äôt really have a problem with it, as long as she is taking care of her shit.  But now it seems while my level of responsibility is increasing, hers is decreasing.  Or maybe this is where she always was but because I also was in a weed haze, I couldn‚Äôt see it for what it was.  Very possible, as I neglected a lot of shit in my stonerdom.  

Someone said the other day it is not for you to change your significant other, but to love them.  I am trying to do that.  But as the friction increases, she is no longer willing to have conversations to discuss solutions to our issues, and frankly it feels like it is devouring my core like maggots on a corpse.  

I am all for direct communication, even when it is painful.  In fact, sometimes ESPECIALLY when it is painful, because I have often found that experiencing great pain is one of the few things in my life that wakes me up to make great change.  

But she is not.  She‚Äôd rather stay silent with a pouty look on her face than open up.  Maybe that‚Äôs unchangeable.  And if so I do not think I can handle this relationship any longer.  Shitty shit truly.  But I do not understand how problems can be worked out without discussion.  I won‚Äôt do it.  I won‚Äôt subject myself to it, and for the love of God I will not subject my future kids to it.  I‚Äôd rather kill myself first.  My family growing up was dysfunctional as all hell.  I will not repeat the cycle.  

Anyway, there‚Äôs much more context and detail that could be added but this post is long enough.  I wanted to get this stuff off my chest in a place where it might be validated.  Thank you to whoever felt inspired to read it.  Your time and effort are certainly appreciated by me.  I wish you all well in whatever journey you are on.

TL;DR - 26 year old male gets good job opportunity, quits weed for drug test, enjoys sobriety, finds spirituality, has friction with girlfriend over weed abuse, becomes excited about quitting, now he never wants to inhale burning plant fumes ever again and is happier than he‚Äôs ever been.",4,0

Since I was a child I had acidity problems which also led to a minor depression due to all good things/celebrations/holidays I had to miss because my weak stomach. I also have a condition, not sure how is it called, but basically if I hear about some medical condition, and if I have at least single symptom, I make myself believe Im sick. Been guaranteed I have cancer at least 10 times in my life etc, which all turned out to be false, I also have been raised in a family that went bankrupt due to a single stupid law change, which closed our family business and left my mum with huge debt  when I was around 16. because of that reason I had to take care of myself and been taught to always try to take as much I can from life, never settle, as one unexpected turn can lose everything you have, which allowed me to reach a lot in business and studies, however never allowed me to enjoy what I already have. 

This bad personality trait and stomach problems were fixed when I found weed, which allowed me to settle and appreciate things that I already have instead of always wanting to have more and better things, its the reason I started smoking often. For first time in life I could watch movie or play games without feeling guilty of wasting my life and was actually happy.

Ok and now about my quitting.  Around a month ago I was driving around with my friend who had 0.5g or so on him and we were pulled by police. In our country, if you get caught with it, you need to spend night in police, unless u were the one driving, then they confiscate car, increases fine and adds extra shit you need to ho through which in total costs around 10k$ all in all. For this reason I decided to take the weed from arm rest and tell cops its mine, to save all the hustle for my friend. 

This marks the moment my life started to change. 

Instead of spending a night in police, I spent 3 nights in jail, of which 2 were just sitting in a small room with literal murderers, one who killed his wife few days ago, other who killed his drnking partner. So glad I had some cigarettes on me and could give them to them, otherwise Im pretty sure Id been beaten up there. 

Then after they released me from there, I had to instantly meet drug addicts specialist, who was basically, for 2 hours straight, telling me that if I dont quit, Ill be dead soon or end up in jail and will spend my life with the similar people that I spent last few days with. At the point I had been psychologically beat up and didnt have any food for 36 hours, so everything he said sounded insanely believable and got pierced into my brain. 

After finally getting back home, I slept for literally 24 hours and took another few days to get back to myself and be ready to smoke again, however smoking was absolutely different. I noticed that I started having small panic attacks everytime I smoke, not like thinking Ill die type of attacks but thinking Im being followed and will be locked up any moment type of panic attacks. I started reading online forums about negative issues of weed and found this subreddit, which I have been following daily since. In mean time I managed to convince myself that basically my life is worthless and its all because of weed, and if I continue Ill just end up being homeless or in jail of dead soon. Whatever bad thing happened in my life, no matter if I was high then or not, I started faulting weed for it. 

When thinking logically I understand that this is bullshit, I have build a company from absolute 0 and sold it for enough to retire, I own my own house, holiday house, have a new car,  a non-gold digger girlfriend of 5 years which I all got while smoking constantly/nearly constantly. however every time I smoke now I get only negative thoughts and all logic doesnt matter anymore, it takes one puff and paranoia turns on. I even become afraid to talk to close people because if I forget some word or just simply misunderstand what they told, my brain goes into panic mode thinking weed made me dumb and Ill never be smart again and they will not want to talk with me again. Even though Ive been smoking next to these same people for ages and they know I smoke and never had a problem with it, logic doesnt matter now when Im high. Being happy after I smoke and finally enjoying life became thing of the past. 

For this reason, about a week ago, I decided I have to quit and everything will be cool. However, reality, so far, has been very different. Yeah I can socialise without thinking about each word too much and paranoia is gone which is obviously nice, however my GERD is back up, I cant eat anything even with medicine as its constantly burning, anywhere I look its so much negativity, covid, riots, financial crisis, looks like world is ending and I feel so helpless. My girlfriend started to annoy the shit out of me and for last few days most of what I think about is that I need to start working again, even though work makes me workaholic and all I start caring about is numbers, but at same time I know that if I start smoking again Ill just be angry on myself and paranoia will be back, also if I start smoking again itll be a proof Im addicted to this and quitting next time will be even harder, even though I had never had problems quitting cigarettes or alcohol, which were part of my life too. 

So yeah, all in all, I feel fucking lost and would really appreciate if someone who had similar strugges, to share what path they took and where it led. 

I hope whoever is reading this is doing well on their journey.

tl;dr Started smoking to allow myself enjoy current moments, stop overthinking and fix my stomach issues, got caught with weed and since then became paranoid and had to quit, however quitting let all my bad traits come back",9,1

For the last 4 years, being high has made me anxious, paranoid, judgmental, self-conscious, dependent on other people to mother me, and manic. Despite all that, I sometimes still see weed as something that used to make any mundane situation extra fun.    

I‚Äôd think of myself as two different people: sober-me and high-me. Sober-me has made a lot of progress and insightful conclusions about weed, and high me usually regrets smoking minutes afterwards. I used to think sober-me was the one that was failing and foolish for getting me high. It finally occurred to me that sober-me wasnt the problem: it was the me who was tempted to smoke.   

Ive noticed the pattern of when this persona comes out. I have to be in presence of weed; I see it, I see my friend smoke it, I smell it, I crave it, I know they will give it to me. Also, this me will throw out all the rational arguments and insights sober-me has gained with a shy wrist and say ‚Äúit‚Äôll be okay, my friends are here, Im safe here, it wont be that bad.‚Äù Thats it, thats all it takes. I just have to convince my friend to let me smoke and then its game over. The me that‚Äôs tempted to smoke feels proud for giving in, and high-me has to navigate how not to be a critical bitch to my friends and myself. High-me blamed sober me, sober-me blamed sober-me, but I realize thats not the case anymore. 

So yeah. It feels nice to acknowledge this third person-I know where to direct my attention to in the future, I can focus more of my energy on not smoking when Im in the presence of it, and I dont have to think of sober-me as a failure.   

I know my weed use is a lot different from most people here, but I hope at least one person finds it relatable and insightful to their journey.",44,0
1164,2020-06-03 09:37:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gvu2wk/100_days_and_it_feels_so_good/,100 days and it feels so good,"I quit right before the pandemic hit and I'm so glad I stuck with it. I feel like a completely different person and I'm finally living life on my own terms. I've completely reworked my entire lifestyle and replaced weed with much healthier alternatives.

What I've learned over these 100 days, is that weed was a keystone habit of mine- a habit that unintentionally carried over into other aspects of my life, creating a domino effect of sorts. For me, it was a negative one. Every time I smoked, I would either play video games, watch porn, watch endless (often pointless) youtube videos, or binge on shitty food. I would waste hours, sometimes even entire days, continuing to get high, cycling through these activities, feeding my brain with immediate, but temporary hits of dopamine and other pleasurable neurotransmitters. They would make me happy and would consistently keep me coming back for more. It was easy to do, but in the end, only gave me cheap and fleeting happiness. After a weed/porn binge, what did I have to show for it except being covered in lube, feeling terrible about what I just did for the last 5 hours, too ashamed to leave my house?

The real joys in life comes from struggle and discipline. Find your positive keystone habit. The thing that gives you a net benefit in every aspect of life. For me, and for most people, that's exercise. Working out regularly not only makes me feel amazing but it gives me incentive to eat better, helps me sleep, improves my self confidence, and overall gives me more energy to do other tasks. It also gives me discipline to do the other hard things in my life that I know will also give me sustained benefits.

On top of exercise, I've started meditating, reading, and playing piano regularly. I even started learning a new language! When your mind is so accustomed to such a high baseline of constant stimulation, it can be difficult to adjust to these tasks at first. If you think it's too difficult, pick just one thing, do it well and do it regularly. Consistency is absolutely key here. Add things on as time allows, as you grow, and as your brain heals. Stack your habits on top of each other so their benefits multiply.

Meditation gives me inner peace and mindfulness, making me less irritable and giving me greater control over my emotions. Reading books gives me new insights into life and strengthens my knowledge base. Playing piano relaxes me and exercises my mind in different ways. I could go on about the benefits but you get the point. Find your activity and see the benefits it adds to your life. To achieve anything substantial, requires struggle and hard work, but the sustained pleasure and sense of well being you get in return is unmatched. 

Humans need progress. Seeing ourselves improve gives us pleasure, in itself. My perspective on weed, and life in general, has shifted massively since I undertook this journey. I don't need weed to be happy. None of us do. Find your inner strength, replace weed with something meaningful, and become your best self.",63,1

I've attempted to give up the sticky green stuff in the past, several times. But my source of motivation was just shame, or something even less inspirational. And I have friends and family that are potheads, so once I heard from them that I'm needlessly stressing about this habit, I always caved.

I was quite content to get stoned by myself, too, of course. My tolerance had me smoking approximately half an ounce per month.  I really fucking loved waking and baking. It's been about 30 years, on and off, so weed is part of my identity at this point. 

No doubt this will be a struggle, despite my new determination.  So, my consistent reasons for a life change:

‚Ä¢ My lungs hurt - tokes are just my OCD
‚Ä¢ I must reach my full potential - to make a career pivot
‚Ä¢ For my future self - emotional and physical health has become much more important since turning 42

I'm about 12 hours in I think? When I first found this sub I thought it was neat and thought ""This would be nice if I ever decide to quit"". 

Well I took a huge rip out of a bong that my roommate got from Amsterdam and was very excited about. Me being the bigdickedfuckyouimaman smoker put a half gram bowl in cause that was normal, but with all the filters and pipes and catches I fucked up and proceeded to swallow a huge amount of smoke. 

I hadn't thrown up that violently since my last bout with functional alcoholism. Then talking with some of my more grown up friends really put it into perspective, as well as getting a few honest constructive opinions from people in my life who've been there since I started 8 years ago. 

What really hit me was a post about the ""Paralysis of Personality Development"" and that could sum up the last 4 years of my life so well. Struggling with any change, and needing to smoke to feel like I could get through a 12 hour shift, or deal with drunk customers (Bartender). 

I honestly cant wait to tell my friends I quit.

But I need help, I'm turning off my phone and shutting down my social media, I don't want to have an excuse to smoke with a friend or complain to anyone about it hurting or be able to order my ounce to my door.

Side note: I‚Äôm sick of people not understanding that weed withdrawal is real. I told my husband for the first time today, I had been hesitant because in the past no one has taken it seriously or believed me. his reaction was to stifle a laugh and roll his eyes.

Weekends fast became wake and bake days so basically anytime that wasn't ""work time"" I was stoned.

About 2 weeks ago I got quite sick for a solid week, it was completely unrelated but I was too sick to even think about smoking. Once I was feeling better I figured I may as well take advantage of the incidental detox and keep it going. One thing I really can't cope with though is the night sweats, a week post being sick they're still really bad, I'm going to bed with spare t-shirts, pillows and blankets ready to swap throughout the night, and from reading quite a few of the posts here it doesn't seem to be as common. 

I've read a little about how THC is stored in fat deposits and can also mess with your hormones which is why, as a woman, I'm wondering if women can be more susceptible to such withdrawal symptoms generally having more body fat and hormone sensitivities.

I've smoked for about 20 years. I went off it 2 times (not including the present) each time it was fine, I went through the usual sweats at night time etc but nothing extreme. I went back on it out of boredom. 

Last month I was really determined to quit as I wasn't enjoying it any more and felt like a slave to it. I was quite surprised how easy it was just to stop. I had no urges to go out and but some. Yes I found it difficult to sleep and when I did get to sleep I was waking up all sweaty. Also having some really crazy dreams but I enjoy them lol 

I'm lucky as I've never had anxiety or anything like that (still don't) but I'm getting a lot of aches and pains mostly my wrists and fingers.

Learning and filling your day with things is so much better than abusing a substance.

I'm a long-time fan of this subreddit, and I am coming up on two months clean from marijuana. The stories shared here have been a big part of my recovery, and I feel close to you all whenever I read your posts. 

I'm wondering if anybody else has had problems with alcohol as they have quit smoking weed? I am worried about my drinking. Since I quit smoking, I've been trying to not drink 4+ days a week. I knew that getting drunk would in someway replicate the pleasure of getting stoned. But I've gotten drunk every day this week, and I'm not even enjoying it. COVID has been a big issue here, as I'm bored quite often.

Like many things in life, weed is a highly addictive substance. Although weed is not ""addictive"" in the same way alcohol or cigarettes are, weed has the potential to elicit intense withdrawal symptoms that can wreck even the strongest of individuals. 

I am writing this post to remind anyone who feels hopeless that you are not alone. I am currently on day 5 of my 3rd attempt at quitting and even though I have only smoked a blunt roughly 5-6 days each week for the past year, I feel absolutely MISERABLE. I am not sleeping, I have no appetite, I am extremely depressed and I am constantly anxious. Despite all of this, however, I am still going to fight because I know that one day these feelings will pass. When this is all over I will come out as a stronger, happier, and overall better person. 

Do not let anyone tell you how you should feel when quitting weed. No matter how much you have smoked in the past, weed withdrawal is different for everyone. For many, weed withdrawal  can be unbearable. But ya know what? There IS a light at the end of the tunnel and this WILL pass. Keep on fighting y'all...YOU GOT THIS.",45,0

I started smoking weed when I was 15 just at parties the occasional zoot nothing you think twice about. But once I got to university, without parents and a lack of safety nets as well as being surrounded by people who smoke all the time I was smoking a 3.5 everyday. I justified it to myself because I could function well on weed and could even do assignments whilst high. But what I didn‚Äôt admit to myself is that my way of living was slowly deteriorating and my work was becoming worse. I became complacent with being satisfactory. I would brush off the fact that I passed out every night with the tv on I would brush off the stomach cramps from eating junk food. I would brush off the idea of addiction even though I would feel
Hopeless when I ran out and a dealer couldn‚Äôt get to me Within the next hour. Over Christmas of 2019 when I was back home I used it as an opportunity to quit. It was horrible but I had exams and was determined to give it my all. I successfully quit for about a month, I felt better than I had in years I was happier I still had problems in my life but I could look at them with more hope and be proactive in making my own life better. As soon as I finished my exams however I used that as an excuse to justify smoking to celebrate. And of course 1 week later I was right back to square 1, constantly high and not living a fulfilled life. Quarantine has helped me realise that if I ever truly want to live my life to my full potential and be the happiest I can be, I have to quit weed for good. I am on my 2nd day and the insomnia, the depression, the headaches, the dizziness and the lack of appetite is making me cry everyday I feel hopeless and all I can do is keep telling myself it will get better. It‚Äôs hard to believe but I know it‚Äôs true because I‚Äôve done it before. Quitting weed is a long term goal and not something achieved overnight.

I was introduced to MJ my freshman year in college like many do. My first experience was blissful and enlightening. Being unable to procure my own stash that was that for the time being. Fast forward 2 years when my housemate is deciding to quit and forgoes his stash to me. I believe this is where the unhealthy habits were birthed. I‚Äôve always been a clown and use humor and entertainment to cover up other emotions. My housemate used me as his dancing monkey on MJ as entertainment and for me I was being given a release. At this point in my college career I would wake up every morning in cold sweats and panic attacks unable to quiet my mind. His olive branch he extended being MJ was quieting these thoughts and allowed me to continue through my days mostly intact. This cycle of smoking my buddy‚Äôs stash at night slowly increased from 1-2 nights a week to quickly 3-4. I quit for a period of months at which point things felt gray and dull although I suspect they were always this way and I had simply been numb to them. Maybe you‚Äôre reading this thinking that if I was smart enough to analyze myself back then why not leave this pit of anxiety being the university. Well at the time my GF, parents, grandparents, and society just all felt like i needed to suck it up and finish the degree. Hindsight I would have done things different. So skipping ahead to my 4th year at the university I have attempted to withdraw myself from the institution to no avail, I felt put into a situation where my folks were telling me either finish the degree supported or leave and figure yourself out without our help. At this point my mental health feels shattered and I am still at this university for which I blame all these problems on. This is where my daily use really took hold. Different to what I‚Äôm reading or perhaps it‚Äôs my unconscious bias I feel that what MJ was doing for me was not giving me anxiety or depression but ‚Äúlifting the veil‚Äù so to speak. When I smoke i feel oddly enough more of my old lighthearted fun spirited self than this shell I see in the mirror. And it‚Äôs been that way since my first time. I feel as if I can express my inner thoughts clearly and precisely as to when I‚Äôm sober it all feels like a jumbled up birds nest in my mind. Fast forward again although this time we jump to present day. I can‚Äôt fully remember how long I have been a daily night smoker but it‚Äôs likely been around a year or two. I did earn that dumb piece of parchment which supposedly should open doors. And now I find myself in the midst of the pandemic as many of us are continuing on with my habits. But again I begin questioning myself as to well I don‚Äôt feel paranoid, anxious, or panicked when I smoke, it‚Äôs the opposite for me I feel relaxed, in control, and more introspective to my own self. I‚Äôve been having mixed conversations with a few people as to whether they believe I have become addicted and the general consensus is yes. Addiction is something I correlate to hard drugs in my mind and visible withdrawals which is why I feel it‚Äôs hard for me to say or even believe that I‚Äôm addicted. I‚Äôve always been someone who procrastinates and looks for the easy route on things and I do not believe that MJ has truly impacted those areas. The one area I do wonder on is my GF, bless her heart she‚Äôs seen me transform from this loving, goofy person I once was to my now toughened, bitter personality. Again not something I directly correlate to my smoking. But alas I have rambled far too long, but this is a great visual as to what goes on in my mind when I think as to whether or not quit... If anyone has any input whatsoever or just their own experiences I would love to hear.

I love weed..so much so, it feels like a part of my identity. Which is kind of disheartening a bit!

I've been really toying with the idea of quitting for a few months now. I've cut down consumption considerably. Went from an all day smoker to a 'nightly' smoker (minus days off which can be an all day affair at times).

Anyways when this whole pandemic started I stocked up on a shit ton of weed. Today I'm down to my last nug. My dealer doesn't have any and doesn't know if/when he'll have some again. So I think this is the right time to try to quit.

I'm scared and also excited. I am curious to see how I feel sober. It's been so long since I felt that way, it might be like a 'new high' so to speak. On the other hand, I'm also scared because I actually hate being sober lol or at least it frightens me.

But I would give myself a good 4 hours to come down from the high. So if I work at 10, I would need to be high no later than 6pm. There were many times where if it was 5pm or so and I was tied up doing something else, I would become an agitated bitch boy, just stressing about having enough time to smoke and to come down from it. I can‚Äôt tell you how much of a burden has been lifted from not having to stress about this anymore! 

Not to mention I would over analyze basic interactions I had at work every time I smoked. Stressing about what I said to so and so, and how they might have taken it.

Context:

Well, I didn‚Äôt think I would find myself here. I‚Äôve (24F) been sober for around three years. I started smoking heavily at age thirteen until I began trying to recover at age eighteen. I was using heavily and in and out of rehab from ages 18-21 so I‚Äôve had a lot of practice at ‚Äòday ones‚Äô. I‚Äôve managed to stay clean for the last few years and love a relatively normal life. Work, study, etc. 

So for the past three years as I‚Äôve said, I have been clean. Aside from a lapse here and there of alcohol or other drugs I hadn‚Äôt considered myself in ‚Äòactive‚Äô addiction for a long time up until about three weeks ago. 

I had been craving on and of for a few weeks and had just been riding it out, but on this particular day I was determined to get high for some reason and succeeded. I‚Äôve been high everyday since, so about thirty days. It‚Äôs causing issues in my relationships and also physically and mentally. I know that I am now dependent and need to stop. 

Two days ago I attempted to quit. Not even a few hours into trying I was so sweaty, felt nauseous and emotional - like I was coming down from something heavy. I was surprised how quickly my body started to crave weed. I went and got some almost as soon as I started to feel anxious. 

Since then I have bought weed once more, tonight, and it caused a gigantic argument between my partner (23F) and I. I told her that I will stop after this time. I really want to stop after this weed is gone. Before I picked up the bag, I knew that I was just trying to justify using again by getting ‚Äòone last bag‚Äô. I feel so conflicted towards my feelings about this. Almost like I‚Äôm being torn in half. 

I think I posted this as a way to vent and hold myself accountable. I‚Äôm considering attending NA meetings when they resume. I just wanted to reach out on here to a group of people who can understand how I might be feeling as I‚Äôm pretty socially isolated at the moment.

Like 3-4 grams of hash every day. That quantity costs around 10 bucks where I live (it's not good hash) and it's sold by some dealers less than 5 min away from where I live. So money alone would be a great reason to quit.

Mental health wise, I'm good, relatively to other times. But still, the guilt and shame are still here. Every single day I think ""I can quit tomorrow/after the weekend/at the end of the month"" and I fail every day. Should I just give up for a while and wait til I gathered my strength? Sounds better than feeling bad about myself, but it also sounds like a dumb excuse.

I hate seeing that 15 year old dealer's face. Every thing is wrong there. It's too expensive for what it is, it's toxic, he shouldn't be doing this, I shouldn't be doing this... I'm going to be a high school teacher ffs, what if I end up meeting a student in a situation like that some day? 

It's gotten to a point where I don't even buy weed anymore, because I'm too resistant. So I look for the nastiest hash that I know will fuck me up.

So I'm postponing it. I hope it doesnt become too late for me, I hope I quit before my brain is in shambles, I hope I don't have any money issues in the near future because of my habits. I don't feel very strong...

Didn't bring any weed with us since we'd both quit. We had a great time, and eventually after a while some guys showed up on the beach and not long after we could smell weed.

We couldn't get our mind off the smell, so my friend went over and asked to buy a joint. They ended up selling us a 1g joint, which I managed maybe 2-3 tokes off it before I was completely gone. It felt amazing, especially since I was on the longest t break (obviously not meant to be a t break though lol) since I'd started smoking. But since then I can't help but be disappointed that I smoked.

Luckily since it was just a single preroll we finished the day with no weed leftover, no paraphernalia etc, so there's no temptation to go pickup more. It was a one off. But it does sort've feel like the progress has been erased. Do I even count this as a relapse or carry on from where I'm at? I mean, it was literally 3 tokes, does that even count?

What I'm curious about is whether the benefits of quitting is erased and setback to day 1. Like, I decided to quit to reduce anxiety, get healthier/better lungs, etc. So is that one off joint gonna put me back to day 1 as if I've been a daily smoker like 34 days ago? Or do I still have 34 days of progress minus a little bit from the setback? It's been over 24 hrs since smoking it and I don't *feel* any negative effects.

I guess what I'm asking is how exactly does relapse effect the progress you've made assuming it's a slipup and not going back to full time smoking? Any insight would be great.",2,0

Here‚Äôs my reasoning, I was 17, smoking for about 1 year straight. I graduated high school, worked at this place for 2 months full-time.

I decided and was way more focused on improving my rapping skills ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (facepalm I know) I really thought I could get famous in a short amount of time if I just focused on making some music... I was smoking wax pen carts on the daily, I was high 24/7. After about 2 months of not being able to find a job for some reason, I began to lose motivation, had little bit of money left, began to get depression, would smoke before eating, before showering, before everything, every 10 minutes I was taking a hit, I felt brain dead, couldn‚Äôt think right, I would sleep at random times after getting too high...

One day I went to Walmart, hotboxed my car with the pen right before I went in. Got out the car, felt weird, walked in and out of nowhere got lightheaded, dizzy, I felt everybody was staring at me, I literally stumbled and fell on my knees. I got back up and my mind was blank, I couldn‚Äôt think at all, I legit thought I was dying. I was terrified of plopping on the floor and passing out. I grabbed a push cart to sustain my body from falling, I hit this little girl who was with her mom and the mom looked at me all weird... 

Don‚Äôt know what happened next, I was completely out of it, Went home, went to the hospital, docs did some scans on me, without telling them I smoke, doctors told me that I need to stop smoking. My lungs and breathing capacity were all fucked up...

Didn‚Äôt smoke for 2 weeks and one day decided to smoke one last time. Kept on smoking, start feeling weird symptoms again so I stopped.

2 months no smoking, an old friend Came back, he hit me up, we smoked, I got absolutely blasted. I was high super high. Felt exactly like my first time ever getting high. I was geeking out, straight tripping. After that terrible high, I stopped smoking for good. 4 months in and don‚Äôt plan on smoking now.",4,0

So I have been smoking weed for about 5 years, it started as something fun to do with my friends once a weekend. Then it turned into every day of the weekend and then everyday. I got to a point where I was spending $200 a week just to get high, but the high wasn't the same fun as it was when it was 1 time on some weekends. I got to the point where I was scrapping resin just to get a buzz. Now I haven't been a habitual smoker for months but I still buy a few grams every month or 2. 

I still have these insane urges to get high (usually at night when I'm used to getting that high). It makes me uncomfortable, iritated, sick to my stomach, and slightly anxious. It usually lasts until I can manage to sleep, which takes awhile when all I can think about is how bad I want weed and how bad I don't want to want weed.

However I'm a bit dismayed, once earlier this week I felt almost like I was high again. Like dissociated, and I was smelling cannabis, and my head had sort of a Sativa euphoria going on.

Someone suggested I could have HPPD. Which is kind of like a PTSD version of drug use, where you can have flashbacks, etc. My story is I used cannabis for about 3 months, and had way to high of a dose on my birthday. It kicked off all my withdrawl symptoms.  I read large doses of cannabis / drugs could kick something like this off. 

Man if that's me...what a bummer. 

I plan to keep being sober forever. And I hope God in his graciousness will heal me. I still have a thick head and anhedonia like symptoms. I'll keep my exercise and nutrition, sleep, meditation going. 

I'll stay positive, there's nothing else to do. But I want my old life back sometimes so badly. It seems so unfair that I / many of us have to be punished so severely for having a short experiment with a legal substance. I screwed up I know, but it's been such a terribly harsh lesson to learn. 

1 year, 2, years, maybe it'll take 5 -10 years. I don't care. I'll never use that horrible plant again.

I never, ever want to hit another cart again. This story is going to be about how I went from never smoking to going through about 40 dab carts that were all fake, and why I'm even posting this.

&#x200B;

Let's start this off where it all began. August 2018. First month of college. I decided to buy weed for the first time ever, so I bought a dab cart from my friend who was selling. That night my other friend and I were out to dinner with our girlfriends and we went to the bathroom to hit the brand new cart. I had hit it earlier, but this was the first time that I had hit it with someone else. Sure enough, as I was handing it to him, the cart dropped out of my hand onto the floor and the glass shattered. I was livid for the rest of the night, considering the first day I bought $35 worth of weed it just disappeared like that. But the next day would be the worst decision I have ever made in my life. The decision that set me down this path. I should have taken this cart breaking as a sign from God that carts should never be used if not they're not real.

&#x200B;

The next day I decided to buy another cart from the same pledge brother who sold me the day before. So another $35 gone, and I still hadn't gotten high once from the weed I had bought. Those next 2 weeks with that cart was the most fun I have ever had in my life. I was getting retarded high every night, with such a low tolerance. My morals shifted from ""weed is bad for your lungs"" and ""let me spend this free time doing things I like"" to ""I don't care about my body, we all die anyway"" and ""all I want to do in my free time is be high"". That is the quantum leap that people who are addicted to something that is shortening your life make, and it's a really terrible one. It led to me smoking weed every day, along with everything that came with that. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, I would spend the remainder of the semester (Sept-Dec 2018) going through probably a total of 7 carts. Then the next semester I went through probably 8 carts. So we're at 15. Then the summer of 2019 comes, and I'm living at my parents' house. At this point I had been smoking weed every day since I bought my first cart (give or take 5 days that I had no access to weed). Obviously I was just gonna buy more carts, still with the mentality of ""we're all gonna die anyway, who cares. i probably wont even get lung cancer."" I think I went through like 8 carts that Summer, at this point going through each cart in 1 week. The 2019-20 school year, my sophomore year of college, I was living in my fraternity house, which meant that I could finally smoke real weed out of where I lived. I finally didn't ever have to use carts again. That whole school year, I had been smoking more than I ever had, spending soooo much money on weed. I began thinking during this time that maybe one day my mentality would switch back to ""I want to live as long as possible"" from ""who cares, we all die anyway."" But it didn't until last week.

&#x200B;

February of 2020 rolls around, and the internship I was starting over the Summer says they are drug testing me, so I had to get sober. I spent over 50 days not being able to smoke, and I felt great, however the thought of getting high never eluded me. Especially once the COVID-19 outbreak began. I was forced out of the fraternity house and into my parents' house again. It's mid-April and I get an email saying that my drug test has been waived due to COVID. Music to my ears. Best news of my life. I immediately told my homies, and tried to find a cart plug where I lived, like last summer. Well, this is where the story gets ugly. I abused the shit out of these carts, and today is June 1, 2020 and I've gone through 11 carts in the last month and a half. When I have had carts in my possession, each one is gone in 2 days. 2 days. 

&#x200B;

I'm starting to cry, but I need to finish this post. There had been rumors spreading since September of 2019 that fake carts were out there, and that they had pesticides that were poisonous to breathe in. Since I live in the South, I am about 99% sure that all of the carts I have smoked were fake. Finally, last week, my brain did make the change from child to adult. From ""were all gonna die anyway, let me rip this cart"" to ""I want to live a long life."" So I stopped hitting carts, and now my lungs feel very different than they did before these 11 carts in the last 45 days. I can finally feel them fully without weed affecting my sense of touch. It feels like there is a tickle in my chest that won't go away, and they hurt a little bit. And it has left me broken. They say that cigarettes increase your chances of lung cancer from 12% to 18%, but what about me? I've smoked 40 fake carts that probably contained harmful chemicals to my lungs. Am I at a 25% chance of lung cancer? 50% chance? 80% chance? I feel like I could die at any age starting at 30 from what I've done. I want to live long. I want to be able to meet my grandchildren in the future, or even great grandchildren. The fact that that is in jeopardy thanks to decisions I have made in the last not even 2 years makes me physically sick. 

&#x200B;

I am a 20 year old male and I have cried about my decisions to smoke a total of 40 fake carts more than every time I have cried in my life combined (besides deaths of loved ones). Please, Reddit, help me. I want to do everything I possibly can to live long from here on out, and reduce my chance of lung cancer. I'm gonna start this journey by never hitting another cart again, ever. I don't know what else I should be doing. Please, I just need help figuring out if I am at risk of dying super young, whether I should see a doctor now or in the distant future when I might be at risk for a lung disease, and anything else that you think I need to hear.",8,2

I tried quitting the first month of pregnancy but started again to help with my nausea and appetite. My husband used it to treat his insomnia. 

I‚Äôll be honest I was skeptical about quitting at first because we were both so heavily reliant on it and would fight constantly when we were sober for over two days. Last week was definitely hell and there were a lot of tears and broken furniture but the storm has passed and like palm trees held on to our roots through the hurricane. 

We have both gone to different coping skills. My husband has started vaping which although it‚Äôs not healthier, it‚Äôs more socially acceptable. He also occasionally takes a few hits from his coworkers pens to get him through the shift and I‚Äôm okay with that. I on the other hand have been meditating and pursuing my goals of finishing high school. I will eat some dried kiwi edibles I love after I give birth (approx 07/27) as a gift from my husband as a goodbye to weed and welcome to our baby. 

I know this is the healthy choice for our baby and I‚Äôm glad we got through the pain of quitting before he arrived. I feel very optimistic about our future and can‚Äôt believe that it was such a abrupt decision.

first of all English is not my first language so if I make any grammatical mistakes or something, I'm sorry. 

I¬¥ve tried quitting weed multiple times this year and was not able to make it. I got really depressed and had a very nasty attitude. All these times the reason for quitting was that it fucked with my brain, I didn¬¥t get shit done and I spent my whole Paycheck in a couple of days on weed. But now I applied for a job where I know I¬¥m gonna get drug tested and I have to say that this somehow makes it way easier for me. I¬¥m not depressed, my attitude is pretty normal and I¬¥m overall pretty happy. I have not smoked since Friday, this maybe doesn¬¥t sound like much but before I could not go a day without weed because of the reasons above. And for some reason, I¬¥m not craving it, every time I quit the urge to buy something and smoke was soooo high but somehow this feeling is not there. My only problems are that my appetite is basically none existent, that falling asleep takes like 30 mins longer and I wake up drenched in sweat every day. 

But there are good things about now smoking too for example now that I'm not stoned all day I can do things that I could not do in years. Like I¬¥ve started playing csgo again which I stopped playing because when I was stoned I couldn't keep up with high my rank.

I am looking forward to a life without weed and I hope that I get accepted at this Job because when I do I know that I cant continue smoking weed because of the Job.

Feeling reeeeally shitty about myself today. 

A few months ago, I nabbed a tiny bit of my housemate's weed, and felt instant regret and guilt about it and told her almost straight away. She was very understanding and kind about it, and offered to hide it as it was just out on the side. I agreed and hadn't thought about it since.

Fast forward a few months, a pandemic and many more quit attempts, and I find myself here; sleep deprived, depressed and desperate for an escape. Housemate was out for the day so I spent the best part of an hour looking for the communal weed me and my housemates bought at the start of quarantine (everybody else in the house is an occasional user).

I suppose it's lucky that she hid it so well, but despite me feeling pathetic and ashamed of myself , there's still a part of me bitterly disappointed that I couldn't find it.

I don't feel worthy of the supportive friends I have. There are people on here who have friends who actively encourage them to start using again, or sometimes even ghost them when they attempt to quit, and here I am with a loving support network and I'm willing to violate their privacy just so I can get my jollies.

I dunno what I'm expecting to get out of this, I guess I just needed to share, and the idea of telling my housemate I've done this yet again fills me with dread.

So I hid my weed in some bushes, miles from home. Odds are no one will find it, and if I want it back, I have to bike a few miles to get it. That‚Äôs a decent hurdle.

I‚Äôm on day 1. Again. I want to quit because I want to be fully myself, I want to take risks that are harder for me to take when I am high and full of self doubt. I want to take the blinders off and not put them back on again. But quitting is fucking hard. No question that I am addicted. I need some encouragement. This subreddit has given me a lot of inspiration, and I‚Äôm hoping that (eventually) I can give some inspiration back to people who are in my current situation, wanting to quit, or wanting to want to quit, but having a very hard time actually making Today the day they actually quit. Anyway. It‚Äôs day 1. Again. Any encouragement you can throw my way would be appreciated <3",9,0

I used to think it made me relaxed and so chill in reality it made me: anxious, always worried about how much I had or when I‚Äôll get more, smoke right when I wake up and continue to be tied to it all day long, pass out by 9pm every night, no connection with my partner, lack of connection to my child, focused mostly on getting high All day. 

The first days are the hardest. Then the first 2 weeks are hard. Then it just became something I no longer did.

All in all. I feel much better and am glad im doing this.

I guess my brain is throwing a temper tantrum from the lack of the THC.

Amazingly, my withdrawal symptoms are still around. I sweat through a shirt every night, I get chills, nausea and just a general feeling of un-wellness. I noticed the symptoms got worse again after my Dad took my family on a ""walk"" which turned out to be a two and a half hour hike. I was feeling a whole lot better before that, taking smaller walks, slowly recovering; but after that hike my withdrawals feel like day one or two again. It's very disconcerting has anyone else experienced this? 

Emotionally I'm not doing great. I get really frustrated with my family and I have to keep my temper down. Like after the hike I was so frustrated with my Dad. CHS has left me super thin and underweight and I'm desperately trying to gain weight back. By hour two on the trail it was apparent that my dad hadn't considered my health at all. My entire family was under the impression that a ""walk"" meant a 30 minute to an hour trip max, my sister and mom were both sore and they're healthy so I was absolutely destroyed by it. I know he didn't mean harm but the obliviousness to my health really pisses me off cause he's been around for all of this and knows where my body is at. I lost the few pounds I had managed to gain back and am at square one again. Last morning he baked me a potato ""to gain the weight back."" Like a single unseasoned, unbuttered potato. The fuck? He's actually a really good cook when he tries too, so it was so annoying to see just this sad little potato that was the result of zero effort on his part. He means well but I'm learning I can't rely on him to consider my recovery.

These past days have been hard but I refuse to smoke again. It's been annoying for sure but I can't return to weed because the CHS will send me to the hospital.

Sorry for ranting, on the bright side my dreams have been very interesting. Just nice fantasies mostly with the oddly funny moment mixed in. No nightmares so far that I remember. Thanks for reading!",2,0

I was sick for two years, I'm starting to get better, and I want to put down the weed but I can't. I don't know if I'm still sick or if I'm just an addict (probably both). I get intense nausea and cravings for weed when I don't have it, but I can go without it for a day or so before pain and fatigue really start to set in. I get physically edgy and unable to concentrate when I'm not high. I'm also depressed (probably worsened by marijuana), and this plays into the concentration issues heavily.

Anyway, I want to quit weed because it's making me stupid and it doesn't help with my depression, but I feel like I need to go to rehab or something. Like, I can't even sleep unless I get up in the middle of the night to smoke. I chain-smoke bowls when I have nothing else to do, so I'll smoke a gram every few hours if I don't watch myself. I can moderate my intake, but I don't want to because I always want to smoke more, so I need to quit.

Any tips for dealing with chronic pain and stomach symptoms without marijuana? The nausea and total lack of appetite + physical edginess/inability to sleep and all that is a lot to cope with.

I feel like I'd have the willpower to quit if I didn't feel like shit with all of the physical symptoms. I can't believe there's no patch for weed like there is for cigarettes. That's the only way I was able to quit those...",2,0

We're a community of around 30 and 10 of us used to smoke together alot. Until a few of us quit weed.

But meeting and making music with the few that still smoke, of course still involves hearing lighters click, smelling tobacco and weed and passing joints. I avoided them for a while, but missed jamming so much!

So last night I went again and had a great time! Every 30 - 40 minutes or so everyone stops playing to smoke one or two, but this time I just kept playing my guitar/didgeridoo instead of sitting there, trying to battle the cravings on my own. 

It's so simple yet so effective! Replacing an unhealthy habit with a healthy one. And even though it is so simple and I could have thought of playing through cravings much sooner, I feel like I hacked life right now :D",3,0

I'm only on day 4 of being off the bud, which feels like a pretty poor effort considering how close I am to buckling. 
I haven't ever been an anxious person, but stopping smoking has made the last 4 days overwhelming to the point that I feel I may have a panic attack constantly day and night. I cant fall asleep without three hours of intense anxiety and worry, when obviously before I would pass out into a coma-like sleep. I am worried that this is my actual state without weed. Has anyone else had this, or has this anxiety just been hiding in the smoke all these years? 
As bad as it sounds, if this is how anxious I am without it then maybe I am better off smoking again? 
I was ready for the irritation, cravings, boredom and night sweats, but this anxiety is ruining me and I want to know if this is just a part of withdrawal? Any advice would be massively appreciated!",5,0

Today is my first full day of beginning this new, healthy chapter in my life.
From age 13 to now (30) I have been addicted to escaping reality....
Weed numbed my past traumas, it gave me something to look forward to and it also took 17 years of my life. 
I can hardly remember my name sometimes which is why I can't carry on. 
I suffer mental health and weed was the medicine and support that I gave myself as I felt failed by the system... now I realise the only one who failed me was myself, I should have made better choices but I have the power now to make the change, I want soberity more than the weed.
love myself a whole lot more and part of loving myself includes self care like taking care of my body right, it's been through enough abuse and I want to appreciate it a whole lot more. I also want to apologise to myself and make a promise to look after me from now on, SOBER!
I'm ready to meet the greatest version of myself and hope you all get to meet yours too,
I wish you all the very best guys,
