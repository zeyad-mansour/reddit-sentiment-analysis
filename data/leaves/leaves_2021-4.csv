I had an idea about how to test the waters... **instead of creating, you edit/mix**? So there's less pressure to create?

My thinking is that I have all these half baked, unfinished songs bc of being a high fuck-- perhaps it will be fun to dive back into them and explore a bit, clean em up, edit, mix a lil.. and then maybe I'll get ensnared. Gonna try it soon and I'll report back.

I never expected quitting to be this difficult. It's kind of interesting going through withdrawal (trying to stay positive), thought I'd share my experience.

How did I get to this point? I quickly fell into a *very* unhealthy relationship with mary jane. This relationship only lasted two years - small time compared to some, I know. Started out OK, only smoked on weekends because I didn't like waking up and going to work with a fuzzy head. Then covid hit and my company went fully remote. I didn't have to wake up and rush to work every morning. I live alone so working from home is pretty damn boring and isolating. So I started smoking more. The past year I was high all day every day (vaping oil and taking edibles). My perception of time is so distorted and my memory is so fucked, I feel like I lost an entire year to marijuana. I'm lucky I still have a job.

Similar story with vaping nicotine, pulled me in just like mj. Started with low nic strength and worked up to 50mg nic salts over a long period of time. Hitting that thing every chance I could. Developed the strange habit of vaping a lot of nicotine right before bed. It's affected my sleep quality, and poor sleep affects everything else in life..

Mental withdrawal: Mood swings like crazy. Inability to focus on something for more than a few minutes. I took yesterday off because I could not focus on anything. Taking me an hour to write this post. Irritable like a mofo - avoiding all human contact right now because I know I'm a god damn mess. Starting to recognize all the habits I paired with weed/nicotine - when I drink coffee, when I take a shower, before I eat, after I eat, before meetings, before bed, waking up, lunch break, right after work... holy shit.

Physical withdrawal: Dizziness/vertigo. Random twitches in legs and arms, feel like I have to move around often. Night sweats. Have to wake up and change clothes it's so bad. My eyes look and feel like I'm still high (assuming it's the lack of sleep). Zero appetite.

The fact that these withdrawals are so bad tells me how deep I was, and gives me motivation to stay the course. Ride it out. Glad we have this community to support each other - best of luck everyone",26,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992337226867676}"

I have come to realize I can't function with pot in my life, it makes me a shell of a person. Pot is what lead to the break up with my ex, he was frustrated with how stuck I had become in life. So I managed to quit and after that we started fighting, I couldn't have the weed around me and the constant want to smoke. He struggled with alcohol addiction and justified smoking because he wasn't drinking. Things just weren't working, so he decided to leave about 18 days into my sobriety. 

I somehow managed to go over 30 days without dabs, even with the breakup emotions. I started exercising and hiking, I signed up for a class, was just getting shit done. Then one day my ex showed up (he has family that lives next door) and was so impressed with everything I had been accomplishing. We made out a little and made plans together, then that night he finds out he might have COVID. He had to self quarantine, so we hung out because he had the time off. He tried to convince me we could make it work, he would keep the weed out of sight and it wouldn't be a problem. I wish that was true. He stayed over that night and after talking we were going to try to make our relationship work. The following 2 days he blew me off (texts & calls), when I finally got ahold of him I could tell he was stoned, had some lame excuses for blowing me off (also had excited plans to get a Nintendo switch). So as difficult as it was I didn't text him, he tried calling once (I missed the call) and that's the last I heard from him. I so badly wanted him to text me or call again but... Honestly the writing has been on the wall and it's too much to ask him to hide the weed (or confront his addiction issues) and he got a Nintendo so that would trump hanging out sober with me.... Anyways after feeling used, being emotionally distraught and being scared I had COVID - I caved... During self quarantine, I started smoking again... Luckily test was neg for covid, unluckily I do have allergies for the first time. I'm thinking my emotional pain manifested physically.

Everytime I smoke I regret it... I ran out last night and am NOT picking up any more oil. It makes me apathetic and unmotivated... Everything seems like a struggle, even during the day when I'm not stoned. Everyday since I started smoking again I just look forward to dabing alone at night... I've even cancelled plans to stay at home and smoke... It's sad. So here I go again with day 1.

I was recently looking for a place like this like alcoholic anonymous have but we don't because weed is so cool and you can't get physically addicted from it.

I was the kind of guy in high scool making fun of people smoking and spliffing, twelve years later, i'm the guy smoking cigarettes on a daily baisis and having a spliff every time I could get for 8 years. 

I started smoking like an addict on 2012 after a major breakdown, and since then, I was smoking more or less 2 grams every day, like an addict. I couldn't see a day without having a spliff. I had a great job opportunity, wearing suits and stuff, what did I do ? i was spliffing before job, and when I wasn't at some client's place, I was spliffing on lunch break at my place. Obviously, when you spliff, you think, you are untouchable and stuff, but you are not, they didn't keep me which was a huge breakdown (again) for me and a well deserved one. (at first, it wasn't the case in my opinion, I needed time to reflect about it) This job would have been an amazing safeguard in my entire life. But guess what ? I fucked it up like I told you.

I couldn't see anything in life enjoyable without a spliff, like really, nothing... I was an addict.

Finally, after 3 years of being depressed at home, I found a new job abroad which isn't perfect, but a good way to restart my life for good. And I chose this place to express my feelings.

Sorry for my bad english as my username would tell you, i'm french. I could have told you more, maybe on another time I will. Otherwise, my main goal is to be able not to smoke for at least three years, not a single spliff, that's my target.

I'm not here to blow my trumpet because I feel depressed and anxious and all the other symptoms of quitting have come and gone and sometimes even come back and it's been shit. But hell if this post can motivate anyone, trust me it's better to feel these emotions instead of hiding from them. I haven't gone back to smoking because I realise now it's not a solution, it's a balm. I respect the good it can do but if you abuse it or you've lost the fun in it, please just think it's not the answer it just hides the problem for a while. 

Stay strong everyone, it may not feel good now but one day you'll be so much more than you ever could be. I know now it gets worse before it gets better so stick at it to all of you who have just quit because there will be a light at the end of the tunnel and I hope I can join you all there soon.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9934646487236023}"

This reminds me of a situation I had when I was younger when i needed to up my dosage in my stimulant medication for my ADHD. Anyone who takes prescription ADHD stimulants, have you changed your dosage after you quit to help readjust my ability to retain information?

Extra information on my story:

There is a lot of factors that could possibly be affecting my brain at the moment. I quit smoking everything including vaping ‚ÄúN‚Äù about a month after I quit smoking weed. Also around the same time of cutting out weed I took a slight blow to the head. I am a hockey goalie and I had this happen a lot. I never felt my cognitive function to be impaired until After this blow and quitting weed at the same time. Not once while I was still smoking did I notice a cognitive impairment. So I‚Äôm currently trying to solve the question of either a concussion being responsible or my withdrawals from weed.

Started smoking weed end of high school and other than a 2 month break after moving and not finding a dealer, I have basically smoked all day everyday. 

I always thought it was helping and enhancing my life. I‚Äôve been to college twice, have successful career in finance the last 7 years. Workout/ sports 3-4 times a week. So I‚Äôve always felt like a motivated person who‚Äôs life is fine with weed in it and it‚Äôs no problem to me.

The last year or so Before quitting I noticed more brain fog in mornings, short term memory issues and all around just not being as on it as I used too. Those issues spilled over into my relationship as well, forgetting things my girlfriend had told me and causing fights and disagreements due to my attitude. 

This was the main catalyst that made me decide to see what sober life was like. Maybe I could fix these issues and become a better partner and person All around. I was scared to quit after all these years and in the back of my mind I thought weed wasn‚Äôt really effecting me that much. I have a house, career, and doing well in life. 

The truth is that I was lying to myself. I used weed as a way to ‚Äúde stress‚Äù after a hard day and really what I was doing was avoiding those emotions and important life moments. 

I decided to quit weed all together 3 weeks ago and I am blown away by the changes I am experiencing so far. I went through with drawls for first two weeks, luckily not as bad as some stories I read on here, but still very tough to go through. After the first week I started to notice my brain fog starting to lift and continues to get better daily. I noticed I‚Äôm more motivated and don‚Äôt avoid the stressful life tasks anymore, I attack them head on. I noticed my relationship improve with my girlfriend. I find myself more in control of my emotions and not so quick to snap on people or become frustrated. I feel like a new person, better to the people around me and more giving to life‚Äôs experiences. 

If someone told me a month ago I would be experiencing these changes I would call bullshit. I was the stoner who could get everything done and was fine, but really it was all a lie to myself. 

Quitting weed has been one of the toughest things I‚Äôve ever went through, but the changes you will experience will motivate you to never want to pick it up again. I feel like I live life on a new high, a sober high, and I never want to change that. 

I hope this gives inspiration to those trying to quit or to the stoner who thinks weed really isn‚Äôt effecting their life in a negative way. Everyone can grow and become better living a sober life. It takes daily work, but in the end is so worth it. 

I hope everyone struggling to quit can fight through the temptations and experience the better life they deserve. You owe it to yourself, friends and family to experience the positive benefits. To experience the emotions of life and face them head on instead of hiding and masking yourself behind the veil of weed smoke. 

I never thought I could do it, but if a daily stoner who literally smoked from the time they wake up to the time they went to bed can do it, anyone can. Put down the bong, put down the joint and experience life to the fullest!

The second you tried that delta-8 cart you knew what you were in for. You had quit weed for a full year and almost comically a week after your friend told you to take a hit of their D8. You tried to justify that it wasn't like weed in your head but, we both know it's the exact same thing. But hey! That's okay. Be kind to yourself, humans are designed to fail, it's getting back up at the end of the day and still pushing. You're back on day 1 after a spiral of a few months of using D8 all the time. But you know what's different this time? You can remember what it felt like to be happy being sober, and still really enjoying life without any weed.   
Now I know at some point you're gonna negotiate with yourself, because let's be honest, you're me and we know how this goes. You can't give in to it though. You'll say you can use it in moderation, or you can still function and smoke all the time, but we both know what really happens when you hit it. It's a poison to you, and although there are successful people who do smoke all the time, you're just not one of those people and no matter how many times you try you won't be. It makes you eat way too much, sleep way too much, it makes your sleep quality shit, it makes you waste your days away. I know you wanna be successful, I know you have way too much you SHOULD be doing right now but when you're smoking, it all goes down the drain. Think how badly you want that future you have designed in your head, and that StrongGinger in your future definitely doesn't smoke weed. You gotta GRIND, remember that you almost always do it out of boredom when you could be learning something new, doing yoga, working out, practicing piano, practicing cooking, literally anything to take your mind off of that boredom because thats what sucks you in everytime. Also get rid of your cart and anything in it, your thoughts that its a waste of money is just that voice in your head trying to keep it around. 

Good luck future me, in all your endeavors. I know you have it this time. I can feel it, 12 months wasn't bad at all, lets go for 13. Then 24. Then 48. And never stop pushing. YOU'VE GOT THIS.

Why do I get so anxious in the first place, and why rely on a substance that literally makes matters worse?  What is it that compels one part of me to crave the escape, and at the same time another part of me to scream out that the escape, the drug, the experience of being high is detrimental to who I want to be,  and what I want to accomplish?  What is it inside of me that is so pained, so fragile and so uneasy that I need to medicate myself?  How is it that habits develop where there are co-addictions between substances and routines, and emotions?  I guess these are all questions that I have not properly addressed as part of my recovery, and which I really need to spend time thinking about.   I am understanding that to succeed in managing my addiction, I will need to really examine what my triggers are, make peace with difficult life experiences and relationships and examine routines and habits to understand how they trigger emotions.       

Also, thank you to those in this community, thanks for reading, thanks for writing and thanks for participating here;  being here allows me to understand that I am not alone and I think in my recovery that is pivotal. 

And here is the weird part for me.  I have never considered my self a religious person.  In fact I have shunned any type of organized religion or rituals.  But in the last couple of years I have begun to examine what my relationship is with God, with my Higher Power.  It may be the most meaningful part of this journey.  Yesterday at around 6:00 am I was lying in bed, I was contemplating a morning wake and bake complete with a dose of other self destructive behavior.  There is nothing like getting high in the morning if you want to have a totally unproductive day .  Instead of reaching for the Vape Pen, I  found myself with tears, and for the first time in a long time I  asked God for help.  I never reached for my vape, instead I came here and wrote.  What's more interesting is that yesterday I prayed on my isolation, feelings of inadequacy, anxiety and being overwhelmed.  I needed to know I was not alone.   
 I needed something that would help me to feel heard and understood.  I asked God to let me know I was not alone.  And..., a message came from a user on this forum that was meaningful, that let me know I was not alone in this struggle, she encouraged me and let me know that help available.  At least for me, my belief, my relationship with God is becoming more and more meaningful and more and more a part of my recovery.  No I do not believe God will blink I will be cured, but I do believe that a meaningful relationship with God can provide inspiration and strength.

It was relatively mutual though I know it was something I should‚Äôve done a long time ago for non-weed reasons, but that‚Äôs another story for a different subreddit.

Weed has been a big part of our relationship. Ever since we started dating we would love to watch TV and smoke. Initially it was pretty innocuous. But with COVID this year we were both furloughed for six months and have been very strict on social distancing. What else were we going to do but smoke all day, everyday?

I‚Äôve known for a while that I‚Äôve had a problem. I quit smoking for a month to pass a drug test for a job so I know I can do it. But I started smoking as soon as I passed because well.. that‚Äôs what we did. We smoked together. It was how we spent time together. But I see now that the habit we formed was hurting us.

A major part of why we broke up boiled down to him not having his shit together in a lot of areas in his life. We both agreed during our breakup that had he not smoked as much he would‚Äôve been more active in trying to change. Maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have sunk into complacency in our relationship. He was already bad about being open and honest about his feelings, rather he chose to suppress and ignore them, and I know that weed was a good way for him to do that. Hell, I did the same thing many times when I thought about maybe breaking up with him. It was a good way to hide the yucky thoughts I didn‚Äôt want to entertain even the notion of.

Although I‚Äôm still completely heartbroken and it will take a long time getting over our relationship, especially because I do still love him despite knowing I shouldn‚Äôt, in a way, this is my chance to quit smoking.

I don‚Äôt have our dealer‚Äôs number ‚Äî he did all of that for us. I‚Äôm going to keep it that way. There were so many times where I wanted to take a T-break (partially because of tolerance but also to prove I could do it for myself and because I know he‚Äôd be doing better in school too). I‚Äôd suggest it, he‚Äôd agree, then when we ran out, all it took was one of us to hint at getting more for the other to break. Many times it was him. I knew that I could stop on my own, but to see him do it everyday and to lose our ‚Äúactivity‚Äù we did would‚Äôve been too hard.

I know going through this breakup and trying to quit smoking is going to be the hardest thing I‚Äôve done in my life so far. But I know that if I continue smoking to get over this relationship, I‚Äôll suppress my emotions and hide from the truth instead of coming to terms with it. In a way, this is a fresh start for me, though a depressing and difficult one, and I should take advantage of that not just for my love life and growing as an individual instead of in a relationship, but also by cold quitting weed.

It might be hard, but I remember by the end of my one month of no smoking, I felt better and didn‚Äôt feel the urge to smoke as soon as I got home from work. I was more productive. Maybe even... happier? But I went straight back to it because it‚Äôs what he did. It‚Äôs what we did.

No more of it. I won‚Äôt let my boyfriend or my addiction stop me from figuring myself out and pursuing a better life. It will be harder than anything I‚Äôve ever done but I can do it and will be better for it.",15,"{'covid': 1, 'distancing': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9878491163253784}"

Previous to this I've been a daily smoker for about 5 years, and I don't get urges to smoke anymore and I haven't since I quit. I'm done smoking for good.

This week I got some bad news from a good friend of mine. 
Backstory:
Back in August of last year I'd been seeing this girl daily just as friends for about 6 months. Every day we'd smoke up together multiple times. Then abt 2 weeks after we started dating she started crying and ran off one day. She completely blocked me on everything and I hadn't heard from her since. I was just able to stop the daily smoking at the time. But after she left and I didn't know why and couldn't get closure or reach out to her I decided to start smoking daily again to hopefully mask the pain and forget about it as easy as she'd been able to forget about me.

Several therapy sessions later, a new job, hobbies and I've also managed to get amazing grades in all my courses this semester, meet a bunch of new friends, and started my own business. Most impressive of all I've finally been able to free myself from the clutches of marijuana addiction, next week marks 3 months. I've truly been feeling great and each day has been getting better.

Until this week I got some unsettling news from a good friend of mine, he came back from university he's graduated now. Turns out this girl has been messaging him trying to get with him for months, thankfully he's a great friend and said he would never do that to me, it's funny because his ex was actually messaging me as well, but I felt the same way, I'd never do that to a friend. 

I'm just in shock, I'm honestly physically in pain about this my stomache has been sick since hearing about this on Monday. Im not exactly sure why this irked me so hard, it feels like I've been over it for a long time now. Part of me feels like I never truly accepted it and just bottled it up. To me she basically died and now that my friend just brought her up I've been reminded she didn't actually die, she just chose to kill me from her life and I don't know why.

I'm truly glad I am 83 days off weed, I've never felt emotions this strong. A weaker me might've went for a puff upon hearing this news, but the sober me knows, clear headed and all, that you can't smoke away your problems, it only makes them worse. The only thing I can do now is to feel it. And to move on. That girl was the first woman I've truly loved, and I loved her so much, even after the time that I spent with her has passed by without her I still miss her. It pains me to know that she doesn't feel the same way. But I'll truly never know.

The one thing I know for certain, my life is the best it's ever been now, whether thats due to her having been in my life or because she left it doesn't matter. I do know for sure that if she were still in my life, so would the flower. I've been trying to quit weed for a while, and this girl was a super stoner, double smoked me everyday. Was not a good influence in that regard. But in everything else she was a great influence. 

I wrote this post today to share, this is probably the saddest I've ever felt. But it feels real, weed hides your emotions, it's not natural to be high everyday numb to what's going on. Although I feel like shit, I'm still glad that I can feel.

Sure it would be easy to light up a join or smoke a bowl, and shit there's a jar of joints my dad rolled up waiting for me. But then these  83 days would be for nothing. And everything I've gained and learnt about myself would be in vain.

I know I'll get thru this, thank you for reading this far if you have. Moral of the story is not to let a setback pull you back down into marijuana addiction, once you've broken free you've proven you can do anything and that you are strong.

I did not expect what was coming, the physical detoxing was intense. 

I lost 5 kgs on my already underweight frame and the night sweats went on for 6 months, the first 3 months I was waking through the night and changing clothes, sleeping on plastic sheets, waking up drenched, my hair would be absolutely soaking went. It was gross.

But the biggest change was something deeper. After about 2 months of being clean I got a bad case of adult acne - hadn‚Äôt had a single pimple since 15. I slowly started to gain weight (10 kgs!) 
I also started to get regular periods. 

But most of all I had a weird mental shift, I felt calm, patient and at peace for the first time ever in my life. It was bizarre and went on for a while, even after the acne and weight gain stopped. But during COVID I started smoking again and here I am getting ‚Äòclean‚Äô for the 2nd time.

during previous attempts at complete sobriety as i was kicking other substances i was essentially made to attend AA/NA meetings (i could choose whichever meetings i wanted but i actually tended to lean more towards AA despite rarely consuming alcohol).

I had the opportunity to live in two different cities during this time and witnessed the same feeling separately in each place. however, the anchor to faith and dissolution of self were unappealing to me. i found it difficult to invest in the literature and ideology, and as a result never truly felt accepted during my time attending meetings and making an effort at working a program.

However, i know many people are drastically altered for the better with these types of institutions. i‚Äôm wondering if anyone in this group has any opinion on the topic.

They say that smoking weed is alot less worse than smoking cigarettes which is probably true but in reality taking anything into your lungs besides air is not healthy for you.

The anxiety and panic attacks that come from it are all the more reason why I have decided enough is enough, my government is okay with allowing people way younger than the recommended age of consumption to ruin their minds and bodies with something like cannabis and I am not going to be another victim to it. I want to enjoy my life to the fullest and it means removing one of my long time vices.

I am struggling so much with my life right now and I felt like weed was the only thing keeping me together. In reality after hitting rock bottom, I realise that weed has probably been the cause of my spike in anxiety and depression.

I have battled with Depression & Anxiety for as long as I can remember and I am pretty certain (99%)  that I have ADHD. I am awaiting a referral call in but it could take months. I have smoked for a few years but only since the pandemic and losing my job did I start smoking way more heavily daily and became pretty much dependent. I last smoked 4 days ago and this past weekend I had one of the worst anxiety attacks I've ever had that landed me in hospital and since then it's been so awful.  
I enjoyed weed, I loved smoking, I miss it, but I abused it too much and landed where I am now. I believe the addictive traits come along with ADHD, I always just thought I had an addictive personality. 

Anyway, I'm struggling, I wish I was able to enjoy things like others can but I need to realise that's probably not ever going to be my reality. 

I'm struggling to find any enjoyment in anything, what do I do now to fill up my time? I don't want to work out.... I don't want to eat.... I don't want to meditate. I can't relax, I just have to sit and listen to all my thoughts and I get so frustrated and **angry**. 

I know a lot of this is about my mental health which I am already seeking professional help for.

Now that my head is out of the cloud i can finally see weed for what it is, it was fun while it lasted but i am now hell bent in taking control of my life, i went to the doctor yesterday for a check up and started my excercise and diet which i plan to stick to until i have achieved my desired results (50lbs by December) 
Weed made me super lazy and a super procrastinater always putting off stuff, i am seeing the world for what it really is and i never want to go back to being this HIGH always in the clouds numb human, i want to feel again. Which i am slowly returning to. The headaches are sometimes alot to bear but i have to push thru, my ears have almost returned to normal and my eyes are not super sensitive to light anymore.

I do suffer from Anxiety, Depression and Massive OCD. today is Day 3 of no smoking and even though its easy at work, whenever I get home, I just sit on the bed and feel stuck for hours without weed. Today was also payday so its the reason for the massive temptations I have today. Seconds away from calling my dealer, and writing him messages and deleting before sending because I don't want to smoke mainly for financial reasons.

My friends all smoke, with my best friend for all life thinks cannabis is God sent and has massive beliefs in it. It works wonders for him, for me not so much as every month my expenses are all weed and I literally end up with no money for anything else. Hence why I'm feeling stuck these past 9 years. Its like I lost all my hobbies, stopped buying clothes, etc.

I want to stop smoking but with the current situation it's so damn hard, Co vid made things much worse for me as I'm always at home bored now after work.

It's like Cannabis hides all my defects, and problems.

Anyone? I just need someone to help me. I'm 27 years old who still lives with his parents, very common thing in my country as rent prices and property prices are sky high!!

There will be friends where the only thing you had in common was Cannabis, and the friendship dies or fades out. 

Most of the people I hung around eventually faded out because they were either just plain boring or we honestly went our separate ways. 

This is the opportunity to find new friends that actually value your self worth. People who want the best for you, not just some added hunk of flesh that can blaze every up when they run low on cannabis. 

Though I must say, the ones who do stick around regardless of your change are the true warriors. Keep them around forsure. 

Last thing to note, you will feel lonely, but use that energy to find other humans. There's so many out there, even if it's online( because you know covids around) can help. Just don't expect that same long- friend relationship to happen over night and with anyone you decide to create a relationship with. It takes time

I cannot even begin to know how many ""Day #1s"" I have had.  Too many.  But I am going to start another Day 1 today, in this moment.  I have learned enough to know that drug use will never provide me with the answers I seek, the calm and tranquility I crave or help me belief in who I am.  So as horribly debilitated as I am feeling in this moment, as horribly defeated, I will keep at it.   I will try to put all I have learned along the way to use, including being cognizant that coming to this forum, or places like it and sharing, all the time, writing even when I am feeling good, is the only pathway to sustained sobriety.  People like me dont just walk away from rituals, routines, habits and addictions, people like me can certainly get sober, but the commitment to sobriety must be something that I visit and reflect on everyday.  

So reflecting on my drug use , I dont use weed to make life more enjoyable, I dont use it to relax or for a few laughs with friends sitting around.  I use weed alone, always alone and in secret.  I use weed to escape from my feelings of being overwhelmed, of never feeling quite good enough,  to medicate feelings of inadequacy, and to escape feelings of internal turmoil and conflict within myself.  These emotional feeling have plagued me since childhood and I guess I found a way to escape from all of that by getting high.  For around 6 weeks now I have been on  bender which is personally debilitating.  High in the morning, high in the evening and stoned all weekend.  I hate it when I am doing it but find the more I do the more I want.  So Day #1 - I am here dreading the next couple of weeks as my body and mind once again readjust. 

So here I am once again, writing, sharing my experience (sort of)  and asking for the strength and wisdom of community.  Thanks for reading.",15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9917562007904053}"

Last Friday I decided was my last night. Saturday and Sunday I laid around and got stuck in the cycle of self hate and misery. It sucked. My sleep was off, my dreams were super weird when I did sleep. I was irritable. Angry. Saying things to myself that you wouldn‚Äôt dare say when other people are around.

Maybe I‚Äôm celebrating too soon, but after only four days I can tell my attention and ability to THINK at work have improved pretty dramatically. I am by no means at my goal yet, but I want to celebrate this feeing now, as I begin my day having accomplished more than I would if I had the foggy weed brain. A lot more. I know it‚Äôs not out of my system yet, but I already feel a slight improvement.

I started working from home at the start of the pandemic. I live alone. Bet you can guess where that led me‚Ä¶.

I had a bowl packed and ready to go immediately after work every day. Started at 4:30 and didn‚Äôt stop till I fell asleep. Groggy me is not a productive me. Spent most weekends stoned from sun up to sun down. Complete isolation.

Shame. So much shame for what I‚Äôve put my family, friends, and coworkers through. All that despite having a family history of substance abuse blasting warnings at me that Im about to fall down the same rabbit hole that my dad did. 

See, he started smoking in his art studio after his job as a Nurse. It broke him. He got paranoid. Lived in his underwear. Ruined relationships with my mom, his mom, my brothers and me. Eventually he lost his job and never started working again. He was smart, compassionate, and goofy. Then, in the grips of his depression and substance abuse. He left. Marriage ended. No job. Broke. LONELY. He missed so many opportunities with his grandkids and never fully understood why nobody wanted to be around him. 

Ahem.

Not only did he ruin his relationship with my mom, he practically ruined her. She has a big heart. She‚Äôs worked with people with mental health issues and saw the signs. As an RN in a clinic with indigent and poor people, she‚Äôs created food pantries. Helped people get rides to the clinic. Donated her money, time, sweat and tears. She cared for people she never met. She sees love. But after he abandoned her, she changed. She still helps people. Still loves. But she didn‚Äôt feel loved.

I bear responsibility here too. After he left I fell into a depression trying to support her emotionally and financially. Moved back into her house to help pay the mortgage, maintain the house, etc. but then I started smoking. Oddly enough I made his former underwear studio into my bedroom. And started smoking weed every night when she went to bed.

Then I got a job away from home, continued to help her with the mortgage, but started to distance myself emotionally from her and everybody else. Because, well, because weed. It made me not care about anybody. Not even my self. 

I didn‚Äôt want birthday celebrations. Can you imagine having a son that doesn‚Äôt want to celebrate their birthday because they wished they were dead? That was me. Eventually that sentiment became a mantra. A self harm mantra. Inescapable and in my thoughts all the time. Then I started saying it out loud. I can‚Äôt stop. It takes all of my energy not to say it in front of friends and family. Maybe they hear it sometimes? If they do they haven‚Äôt said anything.

It‚Äôs been a few years since I lived with her and being left to my own devices I hit the pipe. She could tell. I could see the sadness in her eyes. The frustration. But she never gave up on me and I continued to help her. She knows I‚Äôm stubborn. And she knows what my dad did. I don‚Äôt blame her for not wanting to confront it. I‚Äôm an adult. I knew what I was doing. 

Speaking of knowing what I was doing, I knew I was hurting her. I didn‚Äôt care enough to stop. That will forever be my shame. 

I know I need to say this directly to her, but writing has helped me process the pain that I am responsible for:

My relationship with cannabis began when I started studying at uni. I was introduced by friends, occasionally passed a joint before class or at parties. My first time buying for myself was when I found out my coworker smoked too, and he was more than happy to hook me up whenever I felt like smoking. It didn‚Äôt take long for smoking to become an unhealthy habit. It changed from something I did occasionally with friends to something I did almost unconsciously every morning and night.

Long story short, I smoked heavily from 18 to 21. That whole part of my life feels like a blur. I probably tried to quit over a hundred times. I developed seriously detrimental and unhealthy patterns of behaviour that resulted in me losing friends, dropping out of my course, losing three jobs, and visiting the psych ward twice.

I am now 10 months clean. I have no way of proving this, only the hope that you will take my word for it. I am much happier. My relationships with my family, my girlfriend, and my friends are stronger than ever. I feel healthy and I have goals that I‚Äôm working towards achieving. I meditate every day, I‚Äôm reading books, I do yoga occasionally, I have a good part-time job that I enjoy, and I‚Äôm studying again with good grades.

When I look back at the person I was, reading the letters I wrote to myself and the plans I made for the future, I realise that I‚Äôve accomplished everything I wanted to when I first decided to quit. I feel like an entirely different person. I love more and I feel more. Sometimes I smile so wide that I could cry.

I've been back and forth about quitting so many times I've lost count. I've thrown away my bowl and grinder only to go back out and buy new ones within a week multiple times now. I've struggled with post-traumatic anxiety and insomnia my whole life and it never felt under control until I started smoking in college. Now that I've been smoking pretty much daily for over a decade, I worry that I'll go through all the effort and discomfort it takes to quit only to discover that I really did need it to manage my anxiety after all.

I feel so torn because I know lots of folks need medical marijuana, so maybe I'm just one of those people. But I have a terrible cough, and I sneak bowl hits during work and during social time with non-smokers, so I know my habit can't be healthy. I have also developed a super high tolerance so I go through a LOT of weed.

In the past 5 years I have done lots of therapy and started medication, so in theory I have more tools to deal with my anxiety than I did before I started smoking, but I haven't yet had the willpower to fully get the THC out of my system and see if I can really cope without it. I've tried to cut back a lot but even that is very difficult. If there's weed in the house, I have a really hard time not smoking if I'm craving it.

Early days someone recommended the song Be Yourself by Frank Ocean; it really hit home. In the song, his mum is leaving a voicemail message, as if her kid was going off to college and she's advising not to do drugs/alcohol. She repeats ""don't try to be somebody else"" ""be yourself and know that that's enough"".

I realised all these years of using, I'd been trying to hide my SELF. I was trying to be a cool person, a relaxed person, a happy person. Never stopping to look at my life circumstances which were the root causes of my mood problems. I just slapped on that cannabis bandaid to make it through the day, to be able to get out of bed, to be able to stay in my unhealthy relationship, to continue messy friendships, to work the job I disliked.

Now I'm sober and I'm actually dealing with all this stuff instead of using weed to ignore it. I connect to communities of people who are doing the same thing. I'm working on deciding a career. I'm in therapy. I'm asking my SELF all the time, in every situation: what are my needs? I'm listening to my SELF for the first time, no fog or mood enhancers to distort the answers.

I used to see posts on here listing all the great achievements people had made since getting sober and think wow, I wonder what I'll accomplish. The truth is, I have nothing quantative to show for my clean time: no new job, no big project finished, I still living with parents and that is absolutely fine! The months of sobriety, the mindset change, the friendships repaired, the pride of my family, the 500 joints I haven't smoked, the emotions I'm feeling- those are the prizes! The rest will follow.

I would still get occasional anxiety too. My question is, do those cravings stick around for a while, or do they tend to dissipate after some time? Maybe I just wasn't clean long enough, but even a couple months in I would still get occasional cravings and miss the general activity of smoking.

I feel like Im going insane.,"Im one of those people who cries out for help alot on Reddit. Desperate for help. Desperate for support. And yet, never able to quit. 

I see people posting. ‚ÄúIm on day x and really struggling‚Äù. And the thing is I always envy them cause I can barely go 4 or 5 hours let alone 4 or 5 days. For the record, 0% of that is diminishing anyone‚Äôs struggles and 100% of it is simply self loathing for not being able to even have a modicum of success quitting. 

Im not sure how, but I am at a bit longer than 24 hours now. Im squirming in my own skin. My head hurts. Im nauseous. I cannot sleep. 

I have a stressful rest of my week at work. A persistent fear is going through withdrawal while needing to interact with my boss or anyone I really don‚Äôt want to come off as irritable to. So why quit now?

I need to capitalize on this momentum. So many times I have said ‚Äúquit on Saturday, you can just lay in bed‚Äù and yet every damn weekend i am so stressed from the week, so in need of joy that i don‚Äôt get from work or from relationships, that i indulge. Like a dopamine deficit on steroids cause my life kind of sucks in lots of ways (severe mental illness, no relationships been single forever). 

The reason Im so bullish on quitting now is simple. I can‚Äôt get it out of my head how fucked up it is that abstaining is so painful for me that I have to use this substance multiple times a day, every day, for over a decade. The constant ups and downs my brain experiences. I want to just have my brain on an even level. More than anything, I don‚Äôt want to rely on... well...anything. I don‚Äôt want intoxicants coming into my body due to my own inability to stop. I want to know I can do hard things. 

So here I am laying in bed, feeling like Im going insane. Im worried about tomorrow, how will I interact with people? Will I be able to complete my stressful work tasks?

I was what you might call a functioning stoner. Rocked my college scholarship, won research fellowships, led important organizations on campus, even joined a startup part-time and helped it go from super early stage to acquisition.

But damn I haven‚Äôt ever felt better from any of those wins from what I feel now, after finally quitting weed. I‚Äôm not saying weed is totally bad for me. I know maybe years from now I can smoke a one-off J with friends and not pick one up. But right now, I‚Äôve steadily noticed my ability to mentally combat each thought of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored, let‚Äôs get high‚Äù has grown stronger, and with it has my willpower in any other aspect of life. I think willpower is like a tool you can and must apply to many things in life. This, you build it up through one challenge in life, that ability complements all other life instances where willpower is useful. 

I urge my fellow Leaves members not to simply test your willpower by not smoking. Run on a treadmill, and when you feel like you‚Äôve hit a goal and are kind of tired, flex your willpower to say ‚Äúone more minute of jogging.‚Äù Overeating? Say to yourself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna die if I don‚Äôt eat a larger portion, right?‚Äù That homework assignment is tough and you feel like transitioning to some time-wasting Netflix or YouTube? Say, 5 more minutes won‚Äôt hurt. Sorry if that doesn‚Äôt make sense, that‚Äôs just how I‚Äôve been tricking my brain to exercise more willpower.

Most importantly, enjoy the discomfort of that extra mile jog, that smaller meal, that extra 10 minutes spent on a problem set. That discomfort, at the end of the day, is an emotion. Marijuana blunts the highs as well as the lows. Take it from me. I‚Äôm your example of a person killing it; a student who hasn‚Äôt graduated college yet with a better resume than professionals in their late 20s, a guy who got to solo-explore and backpack Asia before even turning 20. I‚Äôve felt insane highs in my life thus far. I‚Äôve also made some poor financial decisions and nearly gone broke, scrambling to get my life together and pay next month‚Äôs rent. I‚Äôve felt some lows of lows. What I have to say is, in retrospect those moments don‚Äôt feel that different now, because I was pretty much stoned for all of it. For every time you pick up the pipe or roll another backwood to dull life‚Äôs lows, you‚Äôre building a habit that will stop you from experiencing the peak of your life‚Äôs most amazing moments.",11,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8495671153068542}"

If you are on this subreddit, I can assume you've gone through a long period, months or maybe years, of smoking every day. We all remember our first few times smoking and our early experiences with weed: food tastes amazing, everything is hilarious, our thoughts feel profound, music sounds incredible, and simply being high consumes our entire experience. 

Then, time after time of getting high, it goes from this great feeling to simply a ""normal"" feeling. The voice in your head tells you you should stop when high, but you still crave weed sober. You disassociate. You can smoke a few bowls and thirty minutes later question if you're even high. It gets to a point where being high feels so normal you can function at a job, talk to anyone, and do anything because you're so used to being stoned. It isn't ""special"" or ""fun"" anymore. At most, it makes you feel a bit more relaxed and makes you cozy (in other words, lazy as fuck). 

Since deciding I will try to quit, any relapse I've had has come from this idea that after a certain period of time without weed,   smoking will become ""fun"" again. All those fun highs from early high school might return.

Maybe after a week break, being high will feel great? Right? What about a month? Six months? Surely, eventually, that fun feeling will return?! 

It will not. 

Whenever I've relapsed after long periods without smoking, it feels the same as right before I decided to quit. I firmly believe that long term abuse of weed will numb you to the fun parts about it. 

So, stop chasing those fun highs you used to get. No amount of time will bring them back... and at the end of the day, that doesn't have to be a bad thing. You have bigger and better things to go after than a drug that makes food taste good and makes youtube videos more entertaining. You can grow up and find much better feelings.",984,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7696818113327026}"

I know a lot of us on this subreddit struggle with quitting - and believe me, it hasn't been easy for me either. Was a regular toker for almost 10 years and last year, in my depression, I knew it was time to quit. 

The first time I tried to quit was last year - August 2020 - I was sober for 28 days and then I relapsed. I would blame the family drama I was embroiled in as an excuse but it is a very poor one, though I did forgive myself for failing. 

That first time was the hardest - when I had to relearn what to do with myself. How to deal with the boredom. I watched a lot Denzel Washington movies, which helped somewhat, and listened to a lot of Daft Punk. And the first time brought with it the hardest withdrawal symptoms too! Headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, etc. 

2nd attempt was in October/Nov 2020 - remained sober for 4 weeks and then caved again. I thought to myself, what is the point of quitting? I could just live my life smoking weed. It's not hurting anyone. I had conveniently forgotten that it was hurting me and my bank balance. The withdrawals were LESS intense and I dealt with them more easily because I knew what to expect. But I caved again due to depression.

3rd attempt was around Jan/Feb 2021 - and then I noticed something wonderful. I WAS GETTING USED TO BEING SOBER. The previous two quits had made me stronger for the 3rd attempt and I was dealing with the boredom & depression better. I dealt with it better because I told myself - I've already been sober in 2x lots of 4 weeks and what was I doing when I wasn't smoking? I was reading books, playing games, working, writing, doing things. That gave me courage. 

But I caved again. 

4th ATTEMPT - NOW. Almost 2 weeks sober. And during those weeks, I have had next to zero cravings - the fall out was easier to deal with. During my sober times, I had started to create NEW habits - or more like - I had rewired my brain to get a kick out of remaining sober and easily occupying myself and not think about weed. 

Also, the thought of having to go through the withdrawals (The aching stomach, headaches, hot flashes etc) again - REALLY PUTS ME OFF wanting to smoke the devil's grass. I still have some headaches and fatigue and I'm not completely out of the woods yet - but my WILL and stamina to remain QUIT has increased a LOT! 

I know exactly what to expect and I am dealing with things a lot better than I was a year ago! 

I still have my weed contacts - but I haven't been tempted at all to buy more. I'm like - this is good. This is working. 

So to all of you - don't despair if you fail to quit the first time, or the second time or the third time. The more you keep trying, the more stronger you will become! 

I'm hoping to get past the 4 week block this time - Wish me luck! :) 

And good luck to all of you - and a huge thank you to everyone who have shared their stories of successfully quitting weed for good - they have been mana for me! :)",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9893012642860413}"

First off I'll explain the extent I used to smoke. So I've been smoking about 1.6g a day since last September however have been smoking full time for full about five years but not to that extent. I got tired of being stoned all the time and felt myself getting lazy and slower, so decided to make a change. Overall, I haven't really been craving it but I have found myself being extremely forgetful and very short attention span with an intense brain fog (struggling to read, as if I have dyslexia but I don't) today I also forgot how to turn off my shower and turned on the microwave without putting the food in it. I also haven't had any dreams yet even though in the past I used to have vivid dreams whenever I have taken a break. I've also had issues with my coordination, kind of stumbling a small bit more than usual. Do you think this is all because of the withdrawals or is it something more serious? And if it is withdrawals how long would you expect this to last? Honestly done with weed, it's caused me more trouble than good things the past year or so.

Never had a bad experience.  I was always able to stop when needed, for my job, or a supply issue.  Five years ago, I retired, and since it us legal where I live, and my evening habit became more of an all day/ all night habit.  Loving it!  I started indulging in edibles, instead of smoking, and was loving that, too.  However, 15 days ago, I apparently somehow over indulged, and I was truly craving only to be put out of my misery.  I thought I was having a heart attack, or dying, at the very least. I had just had the normal senior citizen blood and cardiac work up,  and everything was exceptionally normal. I knew it had to be the edibles, so I quit cold turkey,  and I was fine for about 2 days. At that point, the anxiety, sweats, headache, insomnia, nightmares, stomach issues, you name it, set in.  Finally, for the past 3 days, I have to say, I have never felt better in my life. I want to thank everyone for sharing their stories and experiences.  It has helped me tremendously.  I am wondering if quitting the edibles is somehow more intense than just stopping smoking?  I love weed, and I never dreamed I would give it up, especially with no career obligations. I'm an old stoner chick who managed a career, a 35 year wonderful marriage, kids, all the while indulging my favorite habit.  It's weird, because I don't even miss it.  I felt that awful. There is a light at the end of the tunnel if you are trying to quit. I somehow, mostly stuck to my normal 5 mile a day walk, and I think that has been the biggest help.  Eating when I was able, and thankful that I'm where I'm at today.  The most hilarious part is the look on my husband's face when I continue to abstain.  Any thoughts on the potent edibles?

Only thinking about the term PAWS brings a wave of chills that travel from the back of my head to the bottom of my back throughout my backbone, because PAWS mean anxiety, insomnia and digestive issues for me, all while having a background vague yet very vivid memories of me being STONED af. 

I got a bad wave of anxiety today, my heart is pounding hard, intense brain fog and I couldn't eat much because basically when I have a wave of anxiety I feel my whole digestive system stop and compulsive thoughts of throwing up start racing through my mind, no real pain or nausea tho.

care to know what distracts my mind from PAWS-induced anxiety? a fucking hot shower like the good ol' times in the first few weeks after quitting, so I said to myself :

""Hey mo, how about jumping under the shower and maybe you can take a handful of dates, fill them up with peanut butter and bring them inside with a huge cup of cold water? so you can down some shit""

WOW, I'M A FUCKING GENIUS! let's go for it! I sneaked in a plate of peanut-butter-filled dates and a cup of water with me in the bathroom, trying not to draw the attention of any of my family members because honestly who the fuck takes a plate of dates with him in the bathroom? and I can't afford to be seen as a complete weirdo. 

mission accomplished, now I am inside and took my clothes off, by that time my heart was already beating hard and I felt my stomach is jumping all over the place so I took a leap of faith, put a couple of dates inside my mouth and JUMPED into the boiling hot water.

I really lost touch with reality once I was in, I couldn't tell whether if it was me who's chewing on the dates under the stream of hot water falling on my head and body or my mind just turned on auto-pilot mode and now I'm out of control and completely in another realm, but man those dates tasted delicious af so I didn't care and kept chewing.

now the dates are inside my belly, shit I need to eat more, I hopped outside the shower while droplets of water were falling off my head and face onto my fucking dates plate, but who cares? I gotta get in some calories so I can live this fucking day and I don't care if my dates are wet.

hopefully I remembered that I got my phone with me so I played Imagine Dragons -- Believer and started jumping and dancing like a manic everywhere while technically being boiled under hot shower water, until a moment came and suddenly..

My derealization lifted off and I found myself jumping in a manic state and everything felt unfamiliar, where the fuck am I? why am I craving a fat joint out of my mind? why the fuck am I anxious like someone who's alone in planet of apes? why am I being cooked under the shower? I became really, really *scared* to the point where I felt that I might be *POSSESSED* in anytime. 

I quickly turned off the water and rushed to dry myself and get the hell out of the bathroom, I did what I intended to do which is drinking 400 ml of water and eating a handful of dates, I have no more business here, and this weird, surreal experience came to an end, can't tell if I'm practically high or not due to residual thc in my system but let's assume that I was.

Dear PAWS and THC, you couldn't break me, I won today again, and I will win tomorrow and the day after.

My cannabis story starts at the age of 15. When I tried it for my first time, my whole world changed. I'm a very anxious person and I struggle calming my anxiety down, but cannabis did everything I ever wanted. I used it once in a while up until the age of 17. My senior year was rough and my anxiety was at an all time high. So I started skipping school to smoke pretty much every day. After I graduated, I kept smoking every day. I didn't go to college, and the immense pressure from my family was too much to handle. Weed kept me sane.

I was unemployed and smoking multiple times a day to keep the sadness away. I also started eating like complete shit. I gained so much weight from stuffing my face while I was high. At the age of 20, I start consuming edibles often. By the time I turned 21, I was eating an edible EVERY DAY. The higher my tolerance got, the more I had to eat. At this point, smoking did absolutely nothing to me. I was depressed, obese, and lost in life. I kept telling myself I'd quit, but I could never do it. I would last the most a day or two, then I'd be back at it.

January of this year, One day I woke up vomiting. I couldn't hold anything down at all, not even medicine or water. This lasted a couple of days until I decided to go to the hospital. They told me I had the stomach flu and that it'd pass. They hooked me up to IV and prescribed me medicine. That was it, I went home and I felt better. After that week of hell, I started eating edibles again. 

In February, I started vomiting again. Just as bad as the first time, I went to the hospital again and I was told the same thing. I went home after I felt better, and once again I started consuming edibles and this time I started smoking dabs as well.

In March, the vomiting began again. This time it was worse, so much worse. I felt like I was about to faint from vomiting so much. I went days without eating or drinking water. Medicine didn't help. This time I went to a different hospital in hope that they'd help me out more. There was no way this was a stomach flu. Well, I found out it was never the stomach flu and I developed CHS (Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome) from over use of cannabis. The doctor told me to stop smoking and eating edibles, and that if I were to do it, I'd end up in the hospital again.

I listened. I am so traumatized from everything that has happened. I've lost 30 lbs. I lost my job because I had to call out so many times. I have so many expensive medical bills. This experience has been hell. May 1st will mark a whole month sober. I know it's not that long, but after years of abusing cannabis, I'm done. I no longer have a choice. If I use again, I WILL get sick. I'm sorry this is a lengthy post, but I'm hoping this can help someone. CHS can happen to anyone at any time. If you want to get sober, just do it now. I wish I would've listened to myself the first time. I don't blame the plant, I blame myself. My bad habits got out on control and my body couldn't handle it anymore. I never thought weed could affect me negatively.

TL;DR - Started smoking at 15. Started smoking everyday from 17-19. At 20, I started eating edibles frequently. At 21, I started eating edibles every day. January of this year, I got so sick went to the hospital. Still consumed edibles. In February, I got sick again. Still consumed edibles. In March, I got sick AGAIN. Went to a different hospital and I found out it was CHS. Now I can't use cannabis AT ALL or else I'll get sick. Been sober for 27 days. Feeling healthy and better now, but my relationship with cannabis is done. 

I don't have a choice anymore. You still have a choice, so if you want to be sober, do it. I know you can. It's hard, but not impossible. Much love to everyone struggling with sobriety.",60,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973978996276855}"

I took every night I wasted on weed and everything bad I thought about myself and just snapped.  Imade one rule. Things only happen if you make them happen.  No matter what I told myself that line.  A fucking rock does not move an inch unless something moves it.

I got more success than Iever imagined and Iam so grateful I have this to go back to now instead of a dead end office job 10 hours a day.  What happened was my motto feel apart.

Getting stoned? Just built my first gaming pc(prolly bc I was stoned and it seemed like a good idea)

In my actions. Spending money for no reason when I don‚Äôt need something, doing something I might not if I were clear minded, saying what‚Äôs on my mind vs just blowing it off and moving on.

I've been smoking almost daily for 4 years now and at 22 years old, with my college graduation less than a month away and having a full time job set up next, its time for a change. 

I feel that weed has clouded my mind and has made it difficult for me to develop good habits, improve areas of my personality, and has kept my mind slow and unresponsive. I want to be more present in my life, not just having my mind wander as I am a witness to my life slowly passing by. Fuck that. It's time to grind. 

I've tried multiple times before to stop smoking, only to make it less than a week before I convince myself that I'm in college and there isn't much of a point in stopping all together. But there is. Even smoking once or twice a week keeps weed in my system 24/7, so I still feel like I'm on the outside looking in.

Day two always gets me. It‚Äôs when I get down on my hands and knees and look for fallen nugs from the last ounce, when I scrape any remaining kief from the grinder and the jars, or res if there‚Äôs none to be had. And then it‚Äôs done, and I‚Äôm back in the car on my way to another ounce.

But this time it‚Äôs different: Two days ago, my wife brought me a pregnancy test - positive. It‚Äôs our second kid, and we are SO excited. The amount I have to ration my energy NOW with one kid on account of my all-day-every-day habits is a STRUGGLE. I can‚Äôt even fathom juggling bong rips with two kids. I need my energy back (and not just the Sativa kind). Additionally, I‚Äôve been coasting as a middle school teacher for the last five years, but daddy needs more money, so I‚Äôm back in the job market, which means potential looming drug tests. I‚Äôve used friends‚Äô piss several times over the years, but want to make this career switch with MY OWN PEE!

I‚Äôve pretty much used this post as a cathartic pump up for myself, so if you read this, let me at least offer what I think my lifelines are when I‚Äôm feeling like I can‚Äôt make it another day:

**1.** EAT FOOD - without marijuana letting me know I‚Äôm hungry, I could go all day without eating a single thing. Come dinner time, I‚Äôm a cranky old man and I feel at my mental breaking point becaaaause - guess what - you have to eat!

**2.** HOT SHOWERS - In these first five days, I‚Äôm going to allow myself to take two hot showers a day. Excessive, yes. But for some reason, hot water running over my body takes me to a mental place that is very close to where weed took me. So I‚Äôm gonna pamper myself for a bit.

**3.** CRAVING? GO RUN - I know many people aren‚Äôt exercise people, and that may make this one even more helpful. Exhaust yourself physically. For me, when I‚Äôm going nuts for weed, I can normally go sweat it out and feel great after going running for a few miles.

In short, I was a heavy smoker from age 17-38 when I started really trying to quit. I‚Äôm 43 now and have had a lot of long streak without smoking in the past 5 years, the longest was 8.5 months that was about a year ago. After that, I started experimenting with moderation and having the occasional toke with friends, never buying my own and with the pandemic I really didn‚Äôt see people very much so it never became an issue until a month ago when I actually purchased my own supply.  

I set strict rules around my usage. Never two days in a row, never after 5pm, never more than once a day....and then slowly but surely I broke them all.  I went out of town this weekend and purposely left my weed at home to force a break. I ended up crippled with anxiety by Sunday and as soon as I got a chance on Monday I lit up again. 

So my journey with moderation has to come to an end, and I know it‚Äôs time to quit. I know I can do it, I‚Äôve done it before and it‚Äôs been a relatively short amount of time that I‚Äôve smoked recently...I‚Äôm just not ready to say goodbye again. I literally just bought a pipe so I didn‚Äôt have to roll joints anymore and could smoke in smaller amounts. I love floating around my house and doing all my chores in a blissful state. 

I‚Äôm so mad at myself for letting it get this bad again...I don‚Äôt want to give away my stash and have to admit that I couldn‚Äôt hack it. I do want to get this perpetual frog out of my throat...I‚Äôve been trying to clear my throat and my snoring has gotten bad again.

I became very dependent on weed especially during quarantine with my toxic family. It was so easy to numb negativity and cure boredom w weed. However I have no self control and i was just getting high everyday all day for no reason and started hating myself for it. I‚Äôd even smoke when i didn‚Äôt want to and the fact that I couldn‚Äôt control it made me hate myself and be more insecure in my other relationships too bc i wasn‚Äôt happy with myself. There were couple months where i‚Äôd run out of my cart and be sober and it was fine expect some cravings  but every time i got a new cart i‚Äôd just smoke with no restraints and moderation.

I was so determined to conquer my inability to have self control that every time I‚Äôd smoke Id feel awful. My chest and lungs were getting bad too. 

I was ashamed to tell my friends and when i did they‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fine you‚Äôll grow out of it or as long as you‚Äôre still getting school work done and can manage it fine go easier on yourself. This made me frustrated bc i just wanted someone to tell me to stop and not give me reasons to smoke more. I reached out to a close friend i smoke with a lot and asked him to keep me accountable but even then I couldn‚Äôt do it. 

Tomorrow is my bday and i wanted to make some changes so today I threw away my cart and I felt powerful and in control. I think weed can take away your sense of control since dependence and addiction mostly isn‚Äôt your choice. I know it‚Äôs gonna suck feeling the withdrawal symptoms and I‚Äôm gonna get cravings. i‚Äôm also upset that i couldn‚Äôt manage to control myself and moderate but i think it‚Äôs important to come to terms with your flaws. I had to accept that yes i SUCK at self control and that‚Äôs fine as long as I had the willpower to make that change and throw away my cart bc i cant be responsible with it is great. 

I hope people see this and are encouraged because it‚Äôs never too late to make changes. Always come to terms with your strengths and weaknesses and work from there.

My GF and I have a 4 year old cat. About 3 weeks ago, he was acting lethargic and didn't pee for a couple of days. Turns out he had a UTI. The vet treated him properly. The first two days were hell. Sleepless nights, not eating, home feeling empty, that kind of ordeal. Everytime we received a phone call from the vet, they really wanted to get the point across that things weren't looking good for him since toxins had begun to buildup in his kidneys and bladder. Day 3 he was stable, the last two days were to monitor certain levels in his blood. We are incredibly lucky to have him. My girlfriend was more distraught than me, she got him right before we moved in together. Still, he is my buddy. An incredible partner and we are lucky to have him back.

I'm 23. For the past 3 years I've smoked at least a bowl nearly every day. Not as long as some folks, but long enough that my brain circuitry isn't what it was before. I started smoking 2-4 bowls a day after I was fired 6 months ago, I didn't cope well with that at all. I've been bringing home money with various side hustles like DoorDash, PointPick, and various e-commerce gigs.

You may think that my use would have skyrocketed during that period, but I just couldn't smoke. I tried the first night and my anxiety was beyond shot. I cried and worried and paced. Pot just wasn't sitting well with me because I was already so worried. I didn't smoke until after he came home.  

I noted how I felt every day. I considered quitting while I was already ahead, to not return to smoking after that 5 days.

My cat has been home nearly 3 weeks, and I have been smoking about a bowl at night since, sometimes a morning bowl as well. Not yet today, we are almost out of bud though.

She smokes for migraine relief at nearly the same rate. I think we both should re evaluate our relationship with Mary Jane but she thinks otherwise given the shit state of everything at the moment. Fair. Thing is, I've been telling myself that for a while. I'm tired of bitching to myself with ""The world is crazy, enjoy a smoke. Life is rough for us all"". It's reasoning that at this point feels like I'm using it as an excuse to smoke. It just feels deeply wrong to allow myself to get away with smoking on some level after a certain point.

Background. I'm 51 years old and started smoking the summer of 6th grade. Yes, since I was 12 and I quit last June. Don't worry about getting high for a while because you'll find yourself some days feeling like you smoked. It's because you've been high so long it takes a few months before it's totally out of your system. I was so high for so long that now not being high really feels like a high within itself. You'll also wake up some mornings thinking you smoked that night and be pissed at yourself until you realized it was just a dream. üòÜ I woke up cursing at myself until I thought about it....and realized it was just a dream. But after a few months your body and mind will enter a new state of conscienceness. You see life and world from a different perspective...and when you've been high as long as me...its really üòé good luck everyone and I'll be cheering for you.

Locate the pain or any feeling in your body and focus on breathing into it, very slowly and consciously. Don't try to breathe super deep, just inhale and exhale slowly and notice how your body naturally wants to breathe and find your own pace--stay present.

You don't need to think about anything, or force your craving or anxiety to go away. Simply go into the sensation you are feeling, even if it feels nasty and you'd want to avoid it. Give yourself a minute or few to breathe and calm down and sort of relax into whatever you're feeling.

You might notice after doing this for a little bit, that you may get an emotional release. The sensation in your body can possibly feel more intense at first when you put your attention there, but don't panic about it.

I tried countless times over the years to quit, moderate and general change my weed habits. Nothing worked. I reached a low point, I just couldn't carry on anymore. The difference this time was coming to complete acceptance and facing my fear of living life as a sober person. 

In my past attempts I would feel like I was denying myself something that deep down I actually wanted. I felt like I was missing out on something. It was not conceivable to go through life without getting stoned (and or drunk, and especially drunk and stoned, that was my favourite). I was afraid - I had been a stoner for so long I didn't think that I could ever cope with life not being stoned. I was afraid. Overcoming this fear and being okay with facing life as a sober was the first major step.

The second part of the equation, for me, was to let go of weed, let go of the belief that I held that it was something I needed. In order to move forward I had to change my views. Stopping weed wasn't a loss of any kind, as I had previously and falsely believed. The truth was it was a major gain in my life and it took viewing it that way to be able to finally put it behind me and move on. I conciously shifted my focus to my new lifestyle - one free of weed. One where I was more in control, one where I had more freedom and didn't depend on a substance to get me through the day (okay, I still love caffeine haha). 

Thats what it took. It wasn't easy. I prepared for at least a year long journey of recovery. I knew there were dark times ahead and I had to be prepared to face them and not blieve that using weed was a solution to that problem like I had in the past. The solution was to soldier through them and get to the otherside so I could finally see what was there awaiting me. I had to learn to work on myself by taking proactive steps to make things better. Identify my problems and weaknesses and actually DO SOMETHING about it instead of just getting stoned so those negative feelings would be blunted.",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9879384636878967}"

Wow, what a journey it has been. I can honestly say that the grass is, in fact, greener on the other side. 

I have quit so so many times before but this is the longest I've ever gone on my own (sans being forced to). It's not an easy path and some days are better than others, but here's what I can say for sure:

- I no longer have any issues with my appetite being in crazy flux. Three meals a day with some snacks in between, but the snacks are no longer a full package of Oreos.

- My anxiety is at an all time low. No more wondering if I'll be caught by my employer. No more fear that I'm not doing enough, or pissing away my time being high. No more fear of running out or being low.

- Cravings are gone (except for the occasional day here and there). This was the biggest thing for me. No more pot sitting on my mind the whole day wondering how I can cut out of work early or leave a function so that I can go get high and sit on my couch.

Additionally, positive things seem to have started to happen for me all in a row. I quit my shitty dead-end job and found one that I'm actually stoked to go to every day. I bought a house and moved out of the city to a more rural area which has brought me tremendous peace. Bought a dog which is a blessing in its own right. And I'm currently saving up to propose to my girlfriend of three years.

Ive been a regular weed smoker for close to 10 years, almost every single day. It all started out innocently with a group of friends, as the days went on we would meet up everynight and smoke together..for years on end starting from our late teens finishing highschool to our early twenties. 

I can honestly say WHOLEHEARTEDLY that i do NOT regret a single thing, i had the time of my life and made memories with dear friends i could never forget. Laughing together high out of our minds, going on adventures in the middle of summer nights 

It was truly a wonderful time to experience and weed allowed us to congregate over a common pleasure/leisure we all began together and indulged in..if it wasnt for weed we would have never bonded and had all those amazing nights of laughter filled fun, and after all those moments are most precious and priceless to us all. 

As time went on and we were thrust into the realities of the world, we got busy and life went on leaving us not alot of time to see eachother as much but weed was something each of us continued to regularly use..at the time not thinking much of it, just working a 9-5 and thinking wow, is this all there is to life?? 

Just to work and die, which drove us to smoke and escape from such a reality we didnt want or wish to be a part of..because weed was the only thing that gave us any happiness even though its all artificially created, it was all we really had and it gave us the escape we craved. 

As time went on, i found myself personally to be a 'well responder' to weed, so to speak..i was still striving to live out my life and do all the things i dreamed and wanted to achieve and so i didnt see an issue in continueing my useage of weed as it wasnt hampering me at all in any way when it comes to the typical side effects many experience, ie; lazy, anxiety, content with life. 

In my many solo sessions, it opened and changed my perspective on life, it showed me insights i never thought of and helped me see life in a different way. It helped me understand people and situations better, as well as myself and the meaning of life, for what purpose and reason im alive.. because i was seeing things in my mind through a heightened state. Not to say it did it for me, but i believe it definitely helped me see more of what lifes about and this made me become a better person in so many ways. 

It showed me alot that i needed to know at a young age and now at 28 at this stage i knew i couldnt continue to keep using it every day and had to make a change. As the saying goes 'when you receive the msg, hang up the phone,. I stopped it simply for the foremost fact that i wanted to be the true me that i hadnt been since my teens..completely sober and just baseline level, i was always under the effects of weed and for the longest time i had quit or tried and was moderately successful at times but never had gone a full 3 months in all those years till now. 

Right now, after 3 months of being COMPLETELY sober and in my own right mind..i can clearly and confidently say that, yes i feel better in many ways such as, i dream again, i can breathe better and exercise more intensely without being puffed out. Ive saved a bunch of cash and ive enjoyed being who i really am deep down at my core, without being under the influence of a substance..which is why ill continue to adapt this lifestyle of sobriety, only smoking on the off chance i feel like i want to or on a special occassion eg; celebration, reward..because lifes short you only live once as clich√© as that might sound..its so true. 

Weed isnt the enemy, but rather ourselves and our lack of discipline and self control, the ability to know when enough is enough and when to tell ourselves 'NO' and to actually stick to it. If you failed to develop such characteristics through other experiences in life then ofcourse you will become addicted..not just to weed but to anything that gives pleasure and a dopamine hit. 

Weed isnt for anyone that cant exercise control over their urges for pleasure, if you know you have bad discipline and self control and it has negative effects on you in terms of what you want for your life then simply dont smoke at all and follow through with that lifestyle, all the more power to you. 

At the end of the day, each person is different, alot of people do struggle with it but my main point is this; 

Weed can be a devil or it can be an angel, it all depends on your strength of mind and whether you can prioritise and choose your own life over throwing your life away smoking day in day out if you know its holding you back or affecting you in a negative way.
And if its not, its always good to take a long break and moderate just so you can experience life and your own self/mind in both ways. 

I wish everyone much success on their journeys, regardless of what you think or if you agree/disagree with what i said, each to their own. I just wanted to share my views on it. 

All of us in the end just want to live well and succeed.

I would've thought that after five days, I'd be done with this. However, while my symptoms have definitely improved, I still feel nauseous and lacking in appetite. It's tolerable, but it sucks. A lot.

Obviously everyone is different, but what sort of timeframe do you think seems typical/reasonable for these symptoms to go away? It's gone on long enough that I'm getting concerned.

I‚Äôve smoked for around 12 years (roughly 10 considering all of my breaks) - from 14 to 26 (male).

My biggest problem by far is chronic fatigue. I sleep pretty good most nights, but I still wake up tired basically every day. I take a nap most days. 

I‚Äôm otherwise very healthy, I work out strenuously or do fairly intense cardio (basketball) basically every day, and my diet is good, at the very least to the point it wouldn‚Äôt be a factor. The fatigue doesn‚Äôt affect my lifting numbers, I would say I‚Äôve been getting stronger in fact. 

To top it all off, I had blood work done and all of my results were good - no issues with thyroid/testosterone/vitamin D in particular.

For people who have smoked a similar amount of time, did you experience this fatigue around 2 months? Did it go away after a while? As I‚Äôve mentioned, I usually sleep pretty good (at least 8 hours a night, I might wake up once or twice briefly), so it‚Äôs not an issue of insomnia per se, more like my sleep not being super restful or something.

&#x200B;

I started as many of you smoking weed in High School with friends for fun and I quickly end up smoking a LOT on daily basis!

&#x200B;

With my first job I moved out to a different city and was living with my best friend. We were young with big dreams and living in a share house with an entry-level position income was not matching our expectations of life. So every day we played a game that we called Russian roulette. The game has simple rules: You hit the bong, prepare it for your friend, then he hits the bong and prepares it for you, and yeah we were doing this until one of us died ( not literary ). I knew I need a change so I moved out again to a different city. I was looking for a new life but ended up lonely and woke up every day with stress and anxiety. I had a nice apartment with a balcony so you can imagine how I spent all of my free time and very often the workdays as well since I can easily work high.

&#x200B;

After a while I found out something is wrong with my neck, I visited the doctor and they told me I have a Cancer - Lymphoma, stage 3 that is pretty aggressive ( you don't want to hear that at age 21 ). In a week I was on chemotherapy and it was a terrible experience, your body is weak, you have no power... Smoking weed at that time was literary the only thing I could do and it was helpful actually, I was the only patient that gained weight and I kept that positive mindset that helps me get through it.

&#x200B;

I managed to get my life back quickly, I am 23 now, I found a new job, a nice apartment, I am living with a girlfriend, I have a nice car with a garage, all you can imagine.

&#x200B;

But I am not happy so I still smoke a lot and it's becoming a huge blocker for my life to move forward. I smoke before my job often, I can do 2-3 bongs before my day starts and lying to myself that it's still okay - it's not! I am forgetting stuff to work, I am not going out with friends anymore because no one is smoking as much as I do, I feel terrible when I don't smoke, I cannot concentrate to work without the weed. Working out sober is also boring... All I think about is weed and when I don't smoke I am thinking about how and where I will smoke again.

&#x200B;

I need a change, now. Since I was 17 years old, I never skipped a single week without weed. I hardly did 3 days in a row without a weed for the last 6 years ( even when I was on chemo ). The only problem is I know I will start smoking again, all of my friends smokes and I love the feeling and I am grateful that it helps me with a lot of troubles in the past.

&#x200B;

26th April looks like the right date for a change, exactly 2 years back they diagnosed me with Cancer and I need to reconnect with myself again to found enough willpower to get through this. I should be grateful that I am still alive.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9922810196876526}"

I'm feeling confident and have taken to writing affirmations around my house to boost my mood and remind me I can do this.

I have a very specific question. Currently, I am on Week 3. While I was smoking every day, I started overthinking and overthinking very much. It's like being high made me think so much and when I got sober, I continued this. I didn't realize that the whole time until now. Is this normal? I read about other peoples on here having a problem with overthinking, but will it stop? And I don't mean that I ""sometimes"" overthink... I am ALWAYS overthinking and just can't stop. The moments, in which I was really happy in these last 3 weeks, were the moments where I wasn't thinking, but being right in the moment. Will this go away by itself? I'm just so scared, that I damaged my thinking and that this won't get away. And the fear of being this damaged makes me even think more about everything. It's like a downward spiral. 

any help? any experience?

I‚Äôm having an insanely hard time and my night terrors are back.,"I‚Äôm a serial ‚Äúaddiction trader.‚Äù Gave up self harm for booze, booze for weed. Started the cycle when I was 10 to cope with being abused as a child.

I‚Äôve been on medication for my mental health but my last one gave me such terrible side effects (akathisia) I started smoking weed. Weed was the only thing that made me stop shaking and freaking out. I‚Äôve tried all sorts of medication since I was 13 (I‚Äôm 30) and my doctor and I agreed it‚Äôs not for me.

On paper, I‚Äôm what people call ‚Äúhigh functioning.‚Äù I‚Äôm successful, great life, great family. I do yoga every day, journal, read stoic philosophy, and live a nonconventional life. I travel, have tons of healthy friendships. I‚Äôm basically the adult I feel like a younger me deserved.

Except for the addiction. Weed kept the anxiety and depression away. Weed helps me sleep. I don‚Äôt get night terrors with weed. I‚Äôm here awake at 1am (ive been tossing for 2 hours, no phone) in terror and anxiety.

I‚Äôm in therapy. My therapist believes I don‚Äôt need medication because she knows how I‚Äôve reacted. 

It sucks because I‚Äôm ‚Äúdoing everything right.‚Äù If it‚Äôs suggested, I try it. 

I‚Äôm also moody AF. My close friends know I‚Äôm trying to get sober and I‚Äôve told them it‚Äôs making me so moody. One suggested I‚Äôm naturally moody, but substances made the moodiness good away. If so, that sucks. All these feelings suck.

Thanks for reading. I downloaded an app for sobriety today.

I had only been smoking for 3 months (regularly, every day or every other day) and it was the best thing that had ever happened to me. It was also the first substance I ever used, even before alcohol and vaping (I grew up in a religious household). Not only did it help with my depression and severe anxiety, it made me the most happiest and sociable I had ever been. Then I got laced, and every experience afterwards was terrifying, felt like PTSD flashbacks every time. I suffer from dissociation from that laced experience and experiences of smoking after, and even though it‚Äôs been two years since the experience happened, I still can‚Äôt let go. It also doesn‚Äôt help that literally all of my friends smoke. I miss it a lot, and wish I could‚Äôve quit to my own accords. I mostly think I miss who I was on it, rather than the weed itself. Or maybe the idea of being able to relax and calm my thoughts on command, and having something that was able to positively reframe my anxiety even while sober. I know I need to accept that it just doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore, but I just don‚Äôt know how and feel pathetic about it. I feel like in just 3 months, I had made weed a part of me which is why I continued to to smoke it for a year after even though it no longer did any good for me. How do I get over this and learn to be happy and fulfilled without it? I feel like i‚Äôm just back to my depressed self now but even worse.

The changes have been small but my life has been changed for the better. When I smoked there was no control for me it ruled me, smoking all day and all night making me content with living in a less than clean house and never seeing my loved ones. I can now admit to myself I lost my job because my addiction overran me, I chose to stay home and get high rather than go to work. 

At its peak weed made me feel like a carefree funny person not caring about day to day but now that the smog has lifted I can see it had the direct opposite effect. It did not make me carefree it made me lazy and it made me annoying borderline rude to those around me, another hard fact to accept but it's true. The amount of money alone I spent daily on weed is ridiculous and on top of it I always ordered out every time I smoked, I gained a decent amount of weight and my bank account looked bleak for a long time. 

The positives of quitting  have made me sure I don't want to go back to that lifestyle. I have lost twenty pounds and I have actual money in my bank account now for the first time in probably four years. Today I was asked to go on a walk around the neighborhood and I stopped the show I was watching to actually do it, a month ago I would've been sitting with the drapes drawn. The best thing I have noticed is I am more kind to myself and forgiving of my mistakes, I have actual hobbies now and am going to the library tomorrow to just....go. It wasn't uncommon when I smoked I wouldn't leave my house for days.

I am authentic. I am me. I can trust the things I say, think, like or dislike, because I no longer have that nagging voice in the back of my head wondering if it's the weed making me feel this way or not. I like myself. I never did before. I was too ashamed of myself because I was living so inauthentically.

I can think clearly. I am remembering things now, even things that happened while I was high that I couldn't recall. I am seeing what I used to miss and grabbing hold of everything I can to make the most of this blip of time I have here on this planet.

I have dreams again! I haven't dreamt in years. I forgot how trippy they can be.

I have occasional pink cloud moments, and they are becoming more frequent. Am I always happy? Hell no. But I can see the light at the end of the dark tunnel of anxiety and depression. Weed kept me trapped there. Now I'm finding my way out.

I have pride. I am proud of the gift of sobriety that I have given myself. I used to roll my eyes when I would read or hear the words ""gift of sobriety"", but it truly IS a gift. Every aspect of it is a new surprise. It's the thing you didn't know you wanted.

I am in awe of what I've achieved. This from a person with incredibly low self-esteem who self-medicated all day every day with weed. I'm getting the negative self talk under control, and allowing myself some credit every now and then. I still need work in this area.

I am saving $400 a month that I'm no longer spending on weed.

I feel better. I look better. My skin isn't as dehydrated and the puffy bags under my eyes are gone.

Sometimes I miss it. I play or listen to music and remember how much fun it was to do that stoned. But I realize those big feelings of ""wow this is amazing"" were all felt in my head. Now I feel it in my heart, and that is so much more sustainable.

Is it enough to just quit? Will putting down the pipe, pen, bong or bowl make all of your problems magically disappear? Probably not. But what it will do is bring you back to baseline so you can address whatever might be holding you back, or causing you heartache, or making your heart race and your face flush, giving you the desire to disappear into a cloud of smoke in the first place. 

Strangely, the more I smoked to escape my life, the more I wanted to escape my life. It was a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. I see now that my purpose on this earth is to live the best life I possibly can. The fact that it takes nine months to grow a new human being is not lost on me. Nine months is really nothing though in the grand scheme of things and I'm aware I will probably be doing this work in some form or another until I take my last breath. But I can say with confidence that no high will ever take the place of how much bigger my life can get, now that I have made the space for it.",23,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9978210926055908}"

Scared to death to quit.,"I'm 28 years old. Have smoked pretty much everyday since I was 15 years old. I don't like to get stupid high anymore but keep a constant buzz pretty much throughout the day. When we had our first child a year and a half ago I quit tobacco (which I had also used since 15), I got rid of all my paraphernalia and now only use vape pens. In my mind I felt like the pens were better because it doesn't smell and I don't have dirty bowls/bongs hiding. 
I like to think smoking doesn't really hold me back from doing too much. I work 50 hours a week. I know I'm an amazing father who puts his child first. I probably clean the house more than the lady does. I do all the yard work, multiple projects,  and go on walks/play outside with the family all the time. 
The other half doesn't have an issue with me smoking and will occasionally take a hit or two before bed herself. I still can't help to feel like I need to quit to better myself. Become even more reliable, less forgetful, clearer minded, healthier body.... But something in me is absolutely scared to death. Growing up in a household with a drunk, abusive stepfather caused me to have anger and anxiety problems... Now, I'm the most laid back, outgoing person you'll ever meet. I deal with people everday, I don't stress, and feel like I'm one of the happier people I know. But what if all that is because this drug is just masking what's really beneath that I've never really truly dealt with.. I want to quit.

I could write pages upon pages about how fucked-up-in-the-head I am, but I'll try my best to keep this as concise as possible.

I'm 40 and have been getting high since I was 14 ; heavily since 17. At this point, I've tried to quit weed more times that I could ever possibly recall. I just can't seem to live without this shit. I hate myself when I'm high, and I'm a mess when I'm not.

I could tell you all about my adolescent and adult trauma, and the reasons why I'm an addict. But at this point, all I care about is surviving myself and living a normal and healthy life. However, I'm almost convinced that this isn't possible. My addiction has shaped my life into something I absolutely hate and resent. I've lost relationships, missed opportunities, stunted my social and personal growth, and have simply let time pass me by in the past 25+ years.

I now live alone, no pets or house plants, no kids, no ex-wives, and the closest family or friend is a few hours away. I'm working from home indefinitely, and I have less social interaction (work or otherwise) than ever before. I used to think this type of lifestyle would be a dream, but it's actually a nightmare.

To make it worse, I'm extremely self-conscious to the point where I absolutely hate how I look. I've always been critical of myself, even in my youth. But now in my adult life, it's almost a phobia. Having to wear a mask these days was sort of a mixed blessing for me. 

I cry all the damn time. I try my hardest not to dwell on what I've lost and where I am, but there's just nothing else in front of me. At least when I'm high, I can distract myself from having to face this reality. And because of that, I'm high every waking moment of the day. I hate admitting this, but if it weren't for my father and sister still being alive, I think it would be a lot easier for me to take myself out of this picture. This is how I've lived for far too long, and it's incredibly difficult to imagine that my mentality will ever change or improve to the point where I can be someone else.

I've quit for months at a time, and even w/o the weed, I am who I am, and I hate this person. I don't know what to do with myself anymore, and even if I did, I don't know how to be any different. I don't know how to be comfortable in my own skin. I don't know how to be comfortable with people. I don't know what I want or even care about anymore. It's exceedingly difficult to find a purpose to wake up in the morning. More than anything, I need people and relationships, but these are what I seem to avoid the most.

I have the freedom to move anywhere I want right now, to live in a new place or create a new start. Most people would give anything for this, but all I do is break down. I've been in the fog for so long that I just don't know how to live, and some days I'm not sure that I want to.",30,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975246787071228}"

I've been a user since 5 yrs and a constant user since last 3yrs. I also got hooked to a drinking habit at the same time, this continued for 2yrs as well in parallel to marijuana consumption. Ive been trying to quit now, and have successfully gone from drinking and smoking everyday to drinking on weekends. However in case of marijuana, I'm unable to go without it for 2 days. This is because, I don't like my job honestly. I'm in a 3yr contract so I can't just let go. Even if I was able to quit my job, I'm not sure I know my calling exactly. I feel I'd be the same average guy at any other job, now since WFH is going on, I tend to procrastinate and do barely 4-5 hrs of work per day while it's a 9hr job. I get anxious during rest of my day thinking about work but I never actually get around to doing it. I just don't feal the zeal for it, mostly Im worried.So I just want to smoke, I feel smoking just gives me the peace of mind, however it's not like I become super efficient or something but Idk I just like it.

I want to get out of this, I've a relationship and I like my person a lot. They love me too I think and have been helping me quit and giving me advice all these days. It's been 15 days since we got serious about the fact of me getting to use very less. The thing is we both enjoy weed, my person however has super control and mostly like smokes once/twice a week. They don't drink that much either. 
They are afraid for me that I might face health issues later on in life which is quite reasonable given her incidents of family in her past, she doesn't want to risk it. 

I feel a little embarassed and ashamed saying I've stocked some more of Mary j tbh and my person knows this since we are living together. Here we are hoping that I'll improve and only smoke once a week and do my job efficiently during work hours so that I'm not anxious all the time but I don't know how I'll change over night

I have long thought of posting, but for some reason I have always backed out. 

Some context about me, started smoking in college on my 18th, quickly turned into a daily toker till my 24th. The last two years I have been on this amazing sub and have had many attempts in regulating my use, to no avail. Eventually I dosed down towards a J a day in my last months, before saying goodbye before Christmas. This year is my sober year, where I stopped drinking alcohol, tobacco and weed. 

I have dreamt quite some time about reaching the 3+ month mark. And I have to say, changes have definitely occured. Like my title indicated, it's a journey of self discovery. I am learning lessons about what I actually like and who I want to be, while also facing the neglect which was induced through my weed-related escaspism. 

My most important insight is the sheer amount of energy which is in my body. For the good or the bad, my negative thought spirals can get very dark. But my positive times also peek more. I am moving out of baseline. Some (practical) lessons I want to share with you are:

- Without clear intentions, there's no reason to continue this journey. Willpower works for a while, but vision and hope keep humans going.
- You will not magically be okay, but you will have the energy to work yourself towards that point.
- It's still important to relax, find your cup of tea in activities which calm you down when you need to.
- Plan your weekends! You have so much time to be out there, but if you just let things slide like (I) used to, nothing will happen.
- Exercising really helps, even if it's only walking, some stretching or a short 5 minute routine. Movement releases dopamine. 
- Habit forming is a strong method towards building systems on your stopping attempt. Don't make them codependent, but use the energy to start new habits.
- Boredom is just your body telling you it is in need to experience.

I will continue to move further, and every urge does seem to get lighter. They don't dissipate, but you start to gain control. Looking at a smokeless life is still dreading, but when focused on the day, I always seem to remember how to smile.

This reflection made me also get into a better place. I was pretty low when I started this idea. Thank you for anyone reading this far, and if not, I still appreciate your presence in this community. If anyone is looking for an accountability partner, or just wants a chat. Feel free to reach out.

This is an update.

First of all thanks for all the amazing comments and messages I received. It meant a lot to know that my post had spurred at least a small number of people into taking action in their own lives! I‚Äôm really happy to be making this update as so much has changed since then. I‚Äôm not sure it will be as long or as interesting as the first, but I think it‚Äôs important that I document my journey to look back on in the future. For reference, I‚Äôll copy the original post link below:

https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mrosvl/i_hit_rock_bottom_received_a_sign_and_now_ill/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

So like the title says, it‚Äôs been 2 weeks since I last got high and experienced the worst day I can remember. The purpose of this update is just to give a real perspective on how I feel my life has changed, no bullshit. When I posted last week I was certainly in a stage of euphoria. Everything was different and a switch had flipped in my head, allowing me to see the real me and lay out a path to change. For example, I remember just driving alone in my car last week and suddenly crying, thinking about how happy I was that I was able to get out of the life ruining weed cycle I was in. Since then, the overwhelming euphoria has died down and who I am now feels like the new normal for the most part. No bud, no lies, no excuses, no laziness, just a real person who feels like a real part of society, no longer detached from the world. 

The most prominent change for me has been no more fucking grey mist. Both the cloudy feeling in my head affecting my memory more than I realised, and the grey veil over everyday life leaving me uncaring and plodding on through, just to get to the spliff at the end of the day. 

With the grey fog gone I feel like my social skills have improved 10 fold, I‚Äôm performing better at work and I can actually remember things people tell me. It‚Äôs incredible! Yesterday, I was at my aunties birthday party, the only other person there I knew was my mum. I was only staying for 2 hours because guests were rotating due to covid rules. Normally I would have just sat there, drank a a couple of cans, spoke to my mum and got through it. But I decided I backed my newfound ability to be a functioning person and struck up a few conversations with some of my aunties friends, which went really well. I felt like I always found something half decent to say, rather than stumbling around in my inner brain clouds, searching for a response. 

With the grey veil lifted, I also FEEL more. Everything. Every emotion is a little more defined both negative and positive. At work I‚Äôve been getting annoyed and angry about things I would normally not care about, and then DOING something about it! I‚Äôm seeing rubbish in my flat, picking it up and throwing it in the bin thinking to myself ‚ÄúHow could I ever have walked past this and left it?‚Äù The answer is of course, that nothing really mattered that much when weed was filling up all the holes in my life. 

The final thing I want to touch on is productivity. I‚Äôve downloaded an app called tick tick, essentially just an app where you make a list of things you want to do each day and tick them off when they‚Äôre done. This has been a godsend. Everything that‚Äôs gone on the list, I‚Äôve done. Just simple things, and just a few a day. I knew I would get time to write this today, so I put it on my Sunday list earlier in the week. Things like, cook dinner, take bins out, buy new jeans, etc... There‚Äôs no excuse not to get these things done. 

I think I‚Äôll leave it at that. I‚Äôll post another update in a few months time, if people are interested. I want to layout my journey and give a real and honest account of my thoughts and feelings throughout. So far it‚Äôs been all positive since quitting but who knows, it might get harder to stay on the wagon moving forward. Finally, to everyone who left a comment or messaged me last time saying they were going to quit, please let me know how it‚Äôs going! Positively or negatively, I want to hear! Any questions on anything specific please also ask, I‚Äôm more than happy to go deeper into any aspect you‚Äôre interested in. Let‚Äôs take this journey together. Thanks for reading, much love ‚ù§Ô∏è",6,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9166274666786194}"

It‚Äôs funny to say I just don‚Äôt really think about it anymore. To those of you who are you still in the early stages of quitting or even just considering quitting but are reluctant because of the withdrawals: just do it. Don‚Äôt think about it. 

I wish I could say my life has made a complete 180, that I am happier than I have ever been, and that everything has improved significantly from me quitting smoking...

The truth is, while a lot has improved ‚Äî the money in my bank account, being more willing to do tasks and be disciplined, some things have lingered.

I‚Äôve been drinking here and there and am recognizing I‚Äôm getting caught in a dangerous pattern of ‚Äújust a beer or two after work‚Äù relatively frequently. While I haven‚Äôt caved and smoked pot, I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been fairly depressed and just bored of life lately. Smoking really did add rose tinted glasses to EVERYTHING and even after a few months it is a bit difficult to resume living joyfully without the use of a substance.

It‚Äôs forced me to deal with things I‚Äôve avoided dealing with in the past. Repressed childhood trauma, letting certain people that are in my life regularly treat me poorly... the list goes on.

It‚Äôs really made me realize, quitting smoking pot was never my problem at all. That‚Äôs the easy part. The hard part is dealing with all the shit that smoking pot helped me keep buried.

I know this post is a bit of a disorganized rant. I apologize to you guys if it hasn‚Äôt entirely been inspirational or motivational ‚Äî but at the end of the day I can honestly say overall, not smoking has been a better choice for me. It hasn‚Äôt been easy or fun the entire time, but i know what I‚Äôm feeling is real.

All I do is school and work it's quite debilitating. It's bringing me down. 

At least when I would smoke then I would be numbed and find the most useless repetitive shit entertaining. I think I'm going insane. Do I really have to resort to doing homework just to pass the time. I really want to scream on the top of my lungs. I don't want to watch YouTube videos or read books tonight. I want human interaction. I don't really have a friend group and I have been single for almost 2 years. It's rough. In the past I would use weed or drugs to cope and now I'm just left in this hole I dug myself into. I feel like God can't give me a break after all the sheer effort I put into bettering myself I still feel hopeless and depressed. I know all I have to do is ""put myself out there"" but my school is all on Zoom and I work at a cannabis club and the people there just want to smoke weed. (I'm a little over 5 months sober)

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. If nothing changes by the end of this year I may resort back to my old ways and using weed was the least of the detrimental substances I used to deal with stuff.

What should I do? I feel like I'm going crazy. I literally do school, work, and homework for 70-75 hours a week. I just want to run away.

I never wanted to admit it, but I'm just as bad as any druggie. Can't feel happiness without smoking, can't eat when I wake up until I take a hit, can't function unless I'm stupid high. I keep thinking that it makes my life better when in reality, it's destroying my life. I graduated with an IT degree 2 years ago (barley, somehow. Had given up cuz of weed) but haven't found a good paying job. I work an hour job when my classmates are making 6 figures. I didn't even work for 2 years because I was so content with my life and smoking, I was getting nowhere. 

 I'm a Muslim, and fasting in this great month of Ramadan helped more than I could imagine. I've been smoking for 6 years, and the only time I can really stop is in the month of Ramdan. We believe that the devil is chained up during this month, so all the evil/wrong actions we do are out of self habit. I've given in before but this is the year I change. Fasting not only evaluates you spiritually, but also mentally and physically. I can feel the toxins washing out of my body. I fast for 15 hours, so I look forward to my iftaar (meal to break the fast). I don't need weed for that. I'm tired so I can sleep. Don't need weed for that. I'm so blessed I got a beautiful girl and life set up waiting for me. About to buy a house. But weed held me back.

 Weed Caused problems in my relationship with my gf, parents, siblings, even alienating friends that don't smoke. Didn't work didn't save money rather wasted it on weed. But now I thank Allah for opening my eyes. I am starting to find my old self again. Social, funny, creative, smart, active, genuine. I love it. Zendya said this on Euphria the TV show- ""I've been so high all my life that being sober feels like another drug."" I literally feel like I'm still high. But I'm just enjoying life man. 

 Alhamdulilah all praise to Allah. Islam really helped me understand. I didn't care about what really matters in life. Weed or any intoxication or addiction is haram (prohibited). So knowing that I'm doing this for my Lord who blessed me with this life and body that I'm throwing away, will be pleased with me. It gives me a purpose and hope.

I smoked a lot socially in college. That's when it was fun. I came in the software industry and continued to use on and off. I wasn't exactly the best engineer high, but I could certainly do the job where I spent most of the time in front of the screen. And to be honest I didn't think people cared. Most people in the industry supported legalization. At first I was never without clear eye and cologne, but eventually people knew, at least within engineering. I was in a leadership position and started managing folks high, conducting interviews high. Maybe my team lost respect for me a little, but for the most part I was productive and aggressive at my job.

For a while I thought there were some benefits to it. For example, the extra paranoia made me very forward thinking and I designed everything to scale. I was very mindful of testing, out of fear for poor quality. Sort of like an artist stuck on the tiniest details when painting. I also thought weed was a source of creativity. There was room for it even as a developer and certainly as a product manager, a role that I dabbled in.

In any case 2 years ago I fell into the cycle of addiction and started milking bongs before work, at lunch, and in the afternoon when I get tired as I sobered up. I wanted to quit but couldn't. I remember paying extra for dispensaries to deliver daily to work, usually as soon as they opened. I did that instead of holding my own stash because I thought I could quit everyday. When I couldn't buy it, I smoked roaches or dug up the weed I threw out. Slowly I became detached and overwhelmed with anxiety when I wasn't high. I blamed the job and leadership for making me miserable.

I left my job and started my own startup after winning a major hackathon (an olympic for us developers if you will). It gave me hope as I embarked on the entrepreneurial journey.  I was under intense stress to make it work, and my pride wouldn't let me quit as the runway looked ever shorter. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before I continued my struggle with weed. I had the will but the anxiety and addiction kept me paralyzed. I started losing sleep and was high all the time. Being high actually kept me up so I could continue working.  I eventually flamed out.

I eventually hit rock bottom. I experienced an acute withdrawal that gave me panic attacks for a week then I was hospitalized. The diagnosis was cannabis-induced psychosis. I was held involuntarily in the hospital. It was traumatic and put me in a world of shame as I battled self-stigma. I was defeated. I stepped away from just about everything that was familiar to me and focused on my mental health recovery through therapy, medication, art, re-connecting to those that genuinely care about me and now /leaves and MA. It wasn't until a few days ago did I have enough courage to rekindle my passion in software development. I'm about 2 years sober with a 2 relapses. 

I am terrified of what others think as I start to be more honest about what had happened. I am wondering if there's any tech workers/entrepreneurs on here that have struggled, or are struggling, with weed. I'd love to connect / learn about your experience. I've been feeling quite lonely on this journey.

At first I thought being sick was like only getting the bad bits of being stoned. But after 3 days of feeling like this, I realise that being stoned IS just the bad bits for me. There's no upside to being stoned anymore, certainly no joy or euphoria in it. Being stoned is like having a fucking head cold (minus the snotty nose, but add more dry mouth and coughing), except that it's self-inflicted and stupid. So while I can't wait for this head cold to be gone, I'm immensely grateful that it came when it did.",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8331456780433655}"

It is in my experience one of hardest substance to stop, having been addicted several drug and a heavy weed user for over 30 years and now 1 month clean I understand the struggle.
Many people include my self wonder if we will ever experience happiness or since normalcy. I do believe the answer is yes.
From what I have read it works like this, our bodies have a endocannabinoid system and there are 2 ways to stimulate this system. The first way is the way we have all been doing it,  using weed. The problem with this way is that we tend overdose the system and turns off natural Cannabinoid production. Also we stimulate the system at inappropriate times which stops emotionally growth lowering our emotional intelligence.
The 2nd way to activate the endocannabinoid system is naturally through the use of mindfulness, praying, yoga, music and meditation this will align our energy systems or our chi energy allowing for the production of natural Cannabinoids.
If you been using weed don't worry you can get back to the natural production of Cannabinoids through practice. It takes time, how long is hard to say the studies range from 6 months to 4 years, it really depends how much and how long you have been using weed for and the work you are prepared to put in to it.

Its been a challenge I'll never forget. I am still going through some PAWS symptoms, that I realize could go on for a while. I still have heavy anxiety surges, and have been having full body twitches. The good news is that my head is clear, and I have moments where I somewhat feel like 'myself'.

I was a 10 year+ user, with heavy usage (multiple times a day) over the last 8 years. My sobriety actually started with my first real quitting cigarettes attempt, which I am 85 days into as well. Ironically I thought that giving up MJ wouldn't be that bad (I was already quitting cigs right?). Boy did I have a eye opening experience.

MJ put a blanket over everything in my life. It numbed everything, good and bad. I have alot of regret as I feel I wasn't truly present for the last decade. I buried a tonne of emotions and feelings that have come to the surface in the last month. Even grief from my mother's death 6 years ago this summer, has come back with a vengeance. 

Dealing with this all while still maintaining my cigarette quit has been a monumental task, that I am still not sure I will get through. I know that cigarettes are physically as detrimental if not maybe more than MJ and Nicotine withdrawl was terrible, but did not have the psychological effects of quitting MJ that I am still suffering.

The silver lining has been that all of this has brought clarity to the severity of my MJ addiction. I am not sure I would have quit of tried to maintain my MJ quit without quitting cigarettes.

I am still navigating my way through. I am not sure if I will be able to 100% maintain my cig quit, but I do know that I am done with MJ. Its hard to believe how bad MJ has f*cked me up. Praying üôè for days ahead.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9752464890480042}"

I calculated that I probably spent about $120,000 dollars on cannabis, which was a big shocker to me. I also haven't done much of anything productive in my life over the last 10 years. Funny thing is over the course of the 10 years pretty much every day I would tell myself this is my last joint, but never had the willpower to do so.

Last year I managed to stay out of it for the 8 months but then suddenly summer came and I met new people along the way. That of course gave me a reason to smoke few joints here and there. The situation wasn't bad and I managed it fairly well. My life was suddenly less stressful at the time so the smoking didn't seem to have a that bad of an impact.  Suddenly when autumn came I started to feel less and less happier about the direction I was going in. I genuinely felt depressed about the job I had and due to that smoking became more frequent. Therefore thanks to my depressive thoughts It became habit to ignore the situation by smoking a lot. Mostly it was weekends though but occasionally I smoked on my work days aswell but that was rather rare I would say.

As experiencing this type of a loop for a several times now I've come to a realization that unless you change your surroundings, friends etc it would be extremely hard for you to drop that bad habit. Honestly in my opinion this is the hardest part. Most of the time it's not the weed, its everything that comes with it. Realize what habits or who causes you to smoke in the first place. Once you know which habits or friends lead you to smoke it becomes much easier to tackle those obstacles.

 In my opinion it's much harder to let go of friends than change your own habits. For me the idea to let go some of my best friends sounds harsh and depressing. But realize that it's better for both parties. Sometimes people need to grow apart in order to grow back together in the future. Use that as a opportunity to be an inspiration to your friends and if possible try to take them along with your journey. If shit hits the fan and you lose your friends in the process then that's okay too. It shows the maturity and growth you have obtained in the process while they are stuck in the place you don't want to be.

At 10 hours, where I am now, you are likely facing withdrawals, an overwhelming urge to smoke (I literally tried bargaining with myself today). After 100 hours, you are still probably in the muck of the withdrawal, but you've had a few victorious days thus far, so you are starting to gain traction. By day 10 you are nearly there to have a greatly reduced amount of withdrawal, but I imagine its still present. If you make it to day 10, I think you have a much higher probability of making, and the probability increases every 10 days thereafter.

When you reach 1000 hours you have been sober for a month. Things should be quite different by now, you should have new habits, and you are not hounded by the desire to smoke every chance you get. At this point it isn't uncommon to still miss it, but you've gained so much strength that you're moving along.

At day 100 you are actually very much passed the cravings. They are not gone (don't know if they'll ever be) but they are drastically reduced to almost a second thought. Every 100 days you will cut your desires signficantly. You should see a lot of changes in your habits, routines, you will no longer be immediately driven to wake and bake.

After day 100 it is substantially easier. Add another 100 days you have been sober for over half a year.

The 10,000th hour you are sober over a year, weed isn't even a thing anymore.

At 1000 days you have been sober for nearly 3 years.

So now you see my theory. It is of course not an exact science, but I think it's been true thus far for my cigarette habit I had for 20 years. The major milestone for me is 100 days.

I wanted to write my first post as today has been an absolute nightmare. I‚Äôve woken up severely anxious thinking I‚Äôm gonna have a heart attack or an asthma attack: obviously my sleep has been disturbed this week and I‚Äôve been having a lot of wild dreams about past traumas and pain. I‚Äôm waking up exhausted and today was just too much. Anxiety isn‚Äôt something I usually suffer from but today I was ready to phone an ambulance. I just feel slightly defeated tbh. I know I want to stop weed. It wasn‚Äôt even a huge deal. I finished my last bit this week and just thought I‚Äôm kinda done with this for the obv reasons. I can‚Äôt regulate my usage, it‚Äôs expensive, makes me sleepy and lazy and health is a huge reason. I‚Äôm a very motivated person and a relative high achiever. I‚Äôve just got my first grad job in a field I love and making leaps and bounds with my goals. But I do feel I have so much repressed pain I haven‚Äôt dealt with as I‚Äôve blocked it from smoking and it‚Äôs so daunting being sober and going through this although I know it‚Äôs the best thing to live my best life and heal. 

My brother died from an asthma attack 5 years ago which was so fucking traumatic and I‚Äôm still processing that pain. I then broke up with my long term partner (12 years) after my bro died, he was emotionally abusive and I never had the confidence to leave him. Then both my dogs died suddenly and my mum and dad both had nervous breakdowns from my brothers death and started abusing alcohol. Things are better now in all respects but I still am conscious of the effect of these things, particularly on my nervous system and the pain I feel. 

I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm asking, just looking for support. Has anyone else had this kind of anxiety after smoking for so long and stopping? I‚Äôve found it so debilitating and I‚Äôm usually so strong minded. I‚Äôve trekked the worlds remote places on my own, supported my self through uni, smashed so many glass ceilings and today I‚Äôm struggling to see my closest friends on my bday. If anyone has been through the things I‚Äôve listed above I would love to connect. It‚Äôs been 5.5 years since I lost my bro and my heart is still broken and I feel weed made it less acute but I know it‚Äôs not sustainable and I need to face that pain. 

Found this thread the other week and I can see how great and supportive this community is. I just needed a place to ramble and ground myself so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm dying.

First off, I'm 36 in June and started smoking when I was 16, I think, so that's about 20 years of nearly constant intoxication from smoking cannabis. Even though I've done it in ways that it wasn't much of a financial burden, for a while now I've suspected that it hurts me as much as it helps me when it comes to relaxing (and a lot of other things). Anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, apathy all worsened.

I finally felt it was time. Now I'm at the end of day two of quitting. In terms of anxiety and depression and all that, I already feel worlds better. I'm definitely feeling the withdrawals though. Urges to smoke. I have the will and reason to get through it, and hopefully it's at its worst in the early stages like right now.

It helps to know that other people are going through the same thing though. I'm glad I found a community to reach out to. Any tips for dealing with those pesky urges that have worked for you?

2021-04-24 03:46:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mxf8ca/sober_since_june_2020/,Sober Since June 2020,"First post in this thread! I just wanted to share my experience with quitting cold-turkey & the withdrawal that came with it. This is gonna be long, so TIA for reading!

For a little bit of background info, I started smoking at the beginning of 2018 I believe. It started out as a casual thing, and carts were really popular at the time. My friend had one and I was a bit nervous at first, but I really liked the feeling it gave me. Before this, I had smoked very occasionally about 4 years prior. I‚Äôd never continuously smoked for long periods of time. 

After trying carts, I moved on to edibles. Edibles were my favorite because the high lasted so much longer, and I didn‚Äôt have to smoke anything. All I had to do was eat a chocolate and I‚Äôd be higher than a kite. I would eat them on special occasions only, but it quickly became a habit of mine to eat a gummy everyday. 

At the time I was dealing with a lot. I had just moved out of my parents‚Äô house for the first time and had all the fun responsibilities of being an adult. This was a huge culture shock for me. On top of that, my SO was having his own issues with alcohol. He drank to excess every single day, and would often get very upset or angry at me when he was drunk. He never physically harmed me, but he would call me names and essentially make me feel like shit all the time. I was using edibles and weed to escape my problems, just like he was with alcohol. I was living with him, my best friend, and her boyfriend in an apartment. Our relationships with each other very quickly became strained, and after a year my SO and I moved into a rent house with two different roommates. 

I thought after leaving that apartment things would be different, and they were to an extent. I was still using everyday, but I wasn‚Äôt as stressed out and my SO‚Äôs alcohol issues weren‚Äôt nearly as bad. Things were looking up, but inevitably shit hit the fan. One of our new roommates was extremely irresponsible, would pay things late, complain about everything, steal our food, and became an extreme alcoholic. The dude would down insane amounts of liquor everyday. Then, in the beginning of 2020, my grandpa was hospitalized. He had hepatitis, sepsis, and pneumonia, and was in the hospital for 6 weeks. He was put on a vent because he couldn‚Äôt breathe on his own. He died on March 12th. Then, all the COVID stuff started and my job closed, my college classes went fully online, and my childhood dog also passed away. All of this took a serious toll on my mental health, and I would escape it all with THC. 

I decided sometime in June 2020 that I was done. I was so sick and tired of running from my problems. I had a mental breakdown at like 3am one night and told myself I was gonna quit. It was random, and I don‚Äôt think one single event caused me to decide to quit. After that night, I never smoked again. 

I even had a scary experience while high and that didn‚Äôt stop me. It had gotten so bad that I was laying in my bed for 6 hours straight, repeatedly taking hits from my THC cart, when I decided I wanted cereal. I was in the kitchen at that point, my head and heart were pounding, my hearing went muffled and my vision was getting really, really tunneled. I realized that I was gonna pass out so I sat myself down for a bit, and the symptoms began to go away. I remember telling myself that I just need to go lay down in my bed, and when I got out of the chair I was sitting in I blacked out and heard a loud bang. I had passed out at my bedroom door and smacked my head so hard against it that my earring embedded into my earlobe. This scared me a little, but I kept smoking. Nothing made me stop until I decided I wanted to.

A few weeks after I quit I was working as a waitress on my job‚Äôs rooftop patio. It was scorching hot outside and I was sweating up a storm, but I periodically went indoors to cool off and chug some water. This is important for later. Up until this point, I hadn‚Äôt experienced any withdrawal symptoms apart from weight loss but I chalked it up to stress. I got off really late and realized I had one of the worst headaches of my life. I get headaches pretty frequently, so this wasn‚Äôt much of a concern. Around 3am though I experienced what I now know was a panic attack. I was really hot but freezing at the same time, my heart was racing, I was shaking and had shortness of breath, and thought I was gonna pass out. It came out of nowhere. I thought I had some sort of heat related illness and decided I needed to go to the ER when I woke up at 8am and still had symptoms. I had an EKG done, everything was normal. They took my blood and gave me a saline IV. I felt great after. The ER doctor, however, mentioned that he didn‚Äôt see signs of dehydration in my blood. I asked if it was normal to have symptoms of heat exhaustion hours later, and they told me no. 

Later that day I went to go get a prescription from my pharmacy for nausea. I ended up having to pull over my car because another panic attack started. I went straight back to the ER and had the same results. I had a full blood panel done at my normal doctor‚Äôs office and had low blood sugar and low salt levels, but they weren‚Äôt low enough for it to be causing my symptoms. My doctor mentioned anxiety but I brushed it off. Looking back I should‚Äôve mentioned my weed usage and that I had quit cold turkey, but I didn‚Äôt. I went to the ER again a week later for the same symptoms, and they mentioned anxiety and panic attacks again. They gave me Ativan that time, which relieved my symptoms. 

I had more panic attacks but I was able to calm myself down with breathing techniques each time. It happened everyday, then every other day, and then randomly. There were no triggers, and each time they came out of nowhere. Eventually, they just stopped. I haven‚Äôt had one in months, but I‚Äôm still scared it‚Äôll happen again. I didn‚Äôt fully realize that this could‚Äôve definitely been withdrawal until a couple of months ago. I had no appetite the entire time either. I started off weighing around 140lbs and ended up weighing 118lbs. I chalked all this up to stress because I had no idea quitting could have this effect on me. 

If you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre a trooper, and just know it gets so much better. My SO and I no longer have issues with drug abuse and we now live in a house we bought a couple of months ago. I‚Äôm never going to smoke again, and I‚Äôm perfectly okay with that. It caused more harm than good, and my life is so much better without it.

The union didn‚Äôt work out. I could keep pushing it‚Äôs not worth the games. But that isn‚Äôt the point.


In the past 5 weeks I‚Äôve smoked once, just a couple hits off my friends joint one day. I realized quite a few things after quitting.


1. I am way less on edge and way less pissed off all the time. This ones important, I‚Äôve been known as a bitter asshole forever 


2. When I was smoking, my entire mindset was about how to get more weed or smoke for free. This usually involved getting anywhere between an ounce to half a pound, trying to smoke my share and break up the rest to get people to buy it. The weed market is competitive and its illegal here. Also it‚Äôs expensive. What if people didn‚Äôt buy? Than I‚Äôm stuck with all this weed and trying to guilt my friends into buying it. At the end of the day it‚Äôs not worth it. It‚Äôs also not worth the paranoia, at the peak of my trapping days I remember seeing 7 cops randomly parked outside my house one night right after I just roasted a fat ass spliff and had someone on their way to scoop an ounce.


3. I‚Äôm way less lethargic. Even though I didn‚Äôt get in the union I have a pretty solid plan to get to where I need to be financially within the next couple years 


4. I‚Äôm saving money. A shitload of money.


5. This ones very important. I‚Äôve been an insomniac since I graduated highschool. Coincidentally I started getting high daily around this time. I work out 5 times a week. Some days I miss because I stay up all night. My sleep schedule seems to be healthier than it has been in years. Everyone says weed makes them sleep. Not me. 


I haven‚Äôt went longer than like a week without smoking in the last decade up until recently. It was way easier to quit than I thought it would be. I had covid back in January and when my taste and smell came back I no longer enjoyed the taste or smell of weed (that also might be because of shit quality around here) and I‚Äôve long been paranoid about ingesting butane from lighters.


I do not miss weed. It does have its uses and maybe I‚Äôll come back to it someday... I know for a fact an old friend is moving back to the state this summer and when he does, I‚Äôll be his connection. I‚Äôll probably help him get an ounce and split it and smoke here and their with him, or maybe keep some around in case I‚Äôm seeing a girl who smokes. I know for a fact that my entire family gets wasted at holidays at my house and I much prefer to be stoned off my ass on some edibles, I‚Äôll be high at Christmas.

I just discovered this thread or community or whatever you call it. I wish I would have found it sooner, because it and it‚Äôs discord seems amazing so far! I want to start by giving a little bit of a backstory. I‚Äôm 19 years old about to turn 20 and started smoking just over two years ago. 
 
  Just like many other people, my journey started out getting high every once in a while. That is, until I got a job and met this guy. He sold weed, and at the time I had already enjoyed the few times I had done it and figured why not. So I bought a dab cartridge off him. My once in a while use instantly went from on occasion, to every night. After, I don‚Äôt know, maybe a month it transitioned into in the morning and at night, and just as quickly went to taking hits off a cart every few hours. 

   This went on for a year or so, going through a cart in just two or three days or two grams a day of flower, when one day I woke up and had a terrible panic attack  right after my typical wake and bake. I had never experienced anything like that before so I decided it was time to take a break. Wow I did not know what was about to happen to me. Panic attacks were constant for weeks, but I got through it. Eventually I felt way better and stayed off the grass for around two months. 

   Of course, me loving weed, decided I was in the clear, and started using again. This went on for about a month, however I wasn‚Äôt using occasionally, it was straight back to being high constantly. The same thing ended up happening, panic attack right after getting high, quitting, and going through the same hell as before. I felt way better at around a month, but eventually the anxiety came back for a while, which I would guess lasted for about two months. This eventually died down and I felt better again. Sounds a lot like PAWS right? 

   Back then I had no idea about PAWS and decided to smoke again. This of course led to the exact same thing happening again. So I quit. This time for good since I learned about PAWS. 

   I‚Äôm now 15 days sober and going through the hell again. I felt way better at about day 10 but this morning I woke up with the panic attacks again. My thinking is that when I was using the first time, I for sure used enough to develop PAWS, and never gave myself enough time to heal. Using on and off for a year obviously didn‚Äôt make the paws any better, except when I was smoking. 

   I guess why I‚Äôm writing all of this is to see if anyone shares a similar story to mine, because up to two years of this anxiety terrifies me. Sorry for such a long post, venting makes me feel better haha.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977222084999084}"

I'm on day 45 of sobriety after 9 years of smoking nearly every day, since I was 15. Weed became such a dominant and forceful part of my personality and followed me everywhere I went. I built relationships around it and gravitated towards other people who smoked. While I had some sort of dependency on weed for the better part of the last 7 years or so, my relationship with it got especially unhealthy during the past 3 years. After going through some life changing stuff, weed became a mechanism for me to suppress symptoms of mental illness as well as mental and emotional trauma.

 I stopped smoking all of November and December of 2020 while focusing on finishing my bachelor's degree. I had severe withdrawal symptoms - intense nausea, night sweats, emotional extremes, gastrointestinal problems (possibly CHS related?), as well as covid-like symptoms which were pretty scary. After finishing my degree I started smoking again in January, and basically spent all of January and February of this year high every waking moment of the day. At the beginning of March I realized that I didn't know what it was like to be a truly sober, functioning adult. I felt like I had done next to nothing to prepare myself for post-grad adulthood, or for improving my mental health state. I decided to quit for good and attempt to face a lot of my personal problems that I had been avoiding for years. I dealt with the withdrawal symptoms again, but this time I was more prepared and tapered off my smoking so it wouldn't be as extreme. I feel very good about my current state of sobriety and I do not regret my decision to quit. 

Many of my friends were supportive of my decision to quit smoking weed and my reasons for it. I really appreciated that no one questioned me when I talked about my weed addiction and the damage it was doing to my body and mind. However, in the 5 months since I graduated from school and the 45 days since I quit weed I've found that many of the people I used to hang out with simply don't seem to want me around anymore. It's really hard to maintain friendships and relationships when they're so one-sided, when I'm the one who has to initiate conversations or plans because they can't be bothered to ever hit me up for whatever reason. When I was smoking, I could always at least count on having someone to hit up to smoke with and bro down with. Nowadays its difficult to get anyone to acknowledge my existence, let alone want to hang out with me. It doesn't help that I don't have any social media besides Snapchat (and Reddit for this sub), because social media is quite toxic and is a drain on both my time and my mental health. I feel a weird duality: I'm happier in the sense that I feel more in control of my life and actions, and I am making positive decisions towards improving my mental and physical well being, such as eating healthier and starting therapy; but I also feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness and a lack of satisfaction most of the time. It's a weird combination of feelings.

I guess I'm making this post because I want to reckon with these feelings of loneliness I'm having, and it helps to put it in writing. And I'm certain that some of you can relate to what I'm feeling right now. I read every post on this sub in some capacity, and I feel connected to all of you. I value this community because it helps me reaffirm my sobriety and makes me feel slightly less alone. Stay sober and find happiness.

Better masturbation? You lost opportunities for sex with the partner

You skipped out on seeing a friend‚Äôs baby

Just two weeks ago I was almost a full month sober and felt great. I was working out consistently, keeping things tidy around the house and just being way more productive than usual. I got past the withdrawal faze and most of my urges to smoke had faded away, especially during the day and mornings. The hardest times were at night. I'm the type of addict that gets incredibly high every night to the point where I can't think of or feel anything but tiredness. I'd ignore whatever responsibilities I had that night and just collapse on my bed because I no longer cared and was wayy to high to do anything about it. Cutting that nightly routine out was the best part of getting sober.

2 weeks ago something happened in my personal life involving a close friend, honestly nothing life-changing, but saddening nonetheless. I'm sure some people on this sub can relate, but I got into one of those moods where I stopped caring about my well being and my sense of self worth was really low. I don't want to call it depression because I know how devastating some people's depression can be and it's not that, just an overwhelming feeling of loneliness and self loathing. That night I somehow convinced myself that the only way to get rid of the pain was to smoke. Before I knew it I was out the door to my local dispo. Fuck I felt so guilty, but I just wanted to be numb again I didn't want to feel anymore. I wanted my nightly routine back of becoming a zombie and not caring about the world.

What a mistake I hate myself. I've been smoking every night since then, lately in the mornings as well. Not working out, leaving my place looking like a dump and eating at the most unhealthy times. I can't tell you how much money I've wasted because I've been consistently throwing away my stash the next morning, only to give in and go buy more for the night when I get home. Above all that, I haven't told anyone I relapsed because of how guilty I am. I've lied to my best friends and I hate it.

I still get into those moods of self loathing, I think that's one of the biggest issues contributing to my abuse. Sometimes I just can't control my mind and I spiral downwards. Can any of you guys relate to this? I need some help or encouragement because I feel so pathetic. I know I'm going to have to go through withdrawals again at this point... it sucks.

2021-04-23 08:30:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mwu6bl/accepting_sober_life/,Accepting sober life,"Approaching one year sober after daily use for 20+ years. There were many periods during those 20 years where I wanted, tried and failed to get sober. I fantasised about being sober, but it was never enough. What I learned about myself is that I had a fear of facing life as a sober person. It was inconceivable to me that I go through life without wanting to be intoxicated. With being sober I knew that there were many other things I would need to face. In order to come through and live a peaceful and healthy life I would have to confront the many things that weed (and booze, and especially weed+booze) enabled me to hide from. It all seemed so overwhelming - quit booze, quit weed, work on addressing the issues that I had been hiding from or ignoring, cope with the withdrawal, start work on improving my life.

Little by little, year by year and indeed decade by decade I watched my life pass by almost as if I was merely an observer of my own life. This caused me a lot of frustration and regret of my choices, wrecking my mental health and well being, fracturing relationships with the people I loved, developing more and more regret as time went on, not giving 100% to achieve my dreams and goals. All this building up of negative feelings around my life choices, coupled with approaching mid-life led me to finally get accountable for my choices and to stop blaming everything on weed and booze. 

Back in 2018 I stopped drinking but continued using weed. It seems like forever ago now and I can't remember much of the beginning but I know it wasn't easy. Gradually I adapted to a booze free life, I think the fact weed was still part of my life made the transition a little easier to tolerate, not optimal, but possibly a little smoother. Booze has a more powerful ability to destroy your life than weed, in my opinion. 

With that behind me and after seeing the improvements quitting weed became a bigger focus for me. There was definitely some improvement but I was still falling short in all categories of improvement since weed was still getting in the way and functionally became a substitude for alcohol. After a year of toying with the idea of quitting weed I woke up on June 14th 2020 after staying up too late, and getting too stoned. I was in no condition to go to work, I wasn't functional. I called in sick. I then laid in bed thinking about my life, my choices, missing work, feeling horrible. All these horrible feelings were a direct result of the choices I was making to continue using weed. Life can be complicated enough as it is and here I was bringing about my own misery. That wasn't the first time I had missed work because of weed. Normally I would then spend the day getting high and watching youtube videos or listening to podcasts to distract myself from my situation of having to miss work due to my weed use. Not this day - I decided that day enough was enough, I wasn't going to get high that day. 

I didn't get high the next day either, or the day after that, or any day between then and now. The first two weeks were hard - I basically was not functional and I'm sure not a pleasant person to be around. I had a lot of headaches in the first month or two and took a lot of naps. Anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure) was my reality for the first two or three months. Things slowly started to get better and by month 5 or 6 I started to feel a bit normal again (whatever normal is). Things really turned the corner at that point. I was enjoying life again, I was facing my demons and working to make improvements. Normal, small things in life started to bring me joy again. I left connected to those around me. Things continued getting better and they still do, here at 10+ months of sobriety.

I never looked back after that day - I guess you could say it was the straw that broke the camels back. I remember that day clearly, I appreciate that I had that day. The choices I have made since then have been working towards improving my life.

Been a daily smoker for the past 4 years now. Similarly to most people, I started off as a casual smoker, occassionally having a joint every few weeks and the next thing I know, I need to smoke it everday(multiple times a day), just to ""feel"" normal. 

The longest I've went without smoking is probably a couple of months when I went back to visit my parents (naturally, cant be smoking then)  but the acccessbility of Mary Jane was also much harder than in the Netherlands. 

However, for the past year, I started realizing that I became an addict and completely lost control over myself. I'm glad that I'm still relatively young (24 M) but my life is currently going NOWHERE.

I need to find my sobreity self again. For the first time in a long time,when I found this subreddit,  I've successfully went almost a week without smoking while being in the Netherlands but unfortunately, I relapsed (though wasnt smoking as  hard as I used to but still daily).

So here's to Day 1 again. Here's to re-discovering my sober self. Here's to learning on having a calm mind. 

Lastly, here's to fixing myself once again. Be better, do better so you can leave a positive impact to your surroundings. and here's to finsihing my thesis.

I am a first year uni student, and I had a really hard time studying the amount of hours I needed to study. I started seeing a psychologist to better understand myself and try to figure out how to get myself motivated again.
Well, she thought I had ADHD and set an appointment for a psychotherapist about a month later, so I can get perception druga. During this time I was smoking almost daily, and because in my country it's illegal and I don't have a lot of money, being a student, the stuff I smoked was really cheap and bad.
But hey man, a high is a high and I just wanted my nightly fix before going to bed.
I had one rule, never smoke when the sun is up, and even then I tried not smoking before 10pm.

Fast forward to the day before my psychotherapist, I had a birthday party with good friends from work. We had a blast, many alcoholic beverages were consumed, and many grams were smoked. But near the end of the night I started feeling like they were not really my friends, that they are pitying me and being friendly than go around and talk behind my back. I was devistated, really heart broken and depressed(It was all in my mind).

The next day I went to the appointment, and started speedrunning my problems to her, telling her about my habits and life problems.
After an hour of discussion she looks at me and says ""Look, I don't rule out the possibillity of you having ADHD, but I'm giving you nothing untill you are totally clean of THC"". That is, 2 months of not smoking. I was buffled, asked for an explantion why the weed matterd. I was smoking only at night, so it shouldn't affect my studies, right? She said that she's afraid I'll develop mania or other psychologic diseases. I was confused, said thank you and left. Broken.

I was really looking forward to cure my ""illness"" of ADHD and get perception drugs. 10 minutes later it hit me. Downloaded an app for staying sober, and decided to quit smoking.

All that paranoia, the feelings I was unloved, that people talk behind my back and that I have no real friends - All the lack of motivation, the feeling of standing in place while the world moves - it was all my fault. It was my unhealthy addiction that fooled my mind into thinking those unhealthy thoughts and made me into an unmotivated carpet. 
And man, did it hit like a brick.

Last night I went to a bar with my student friends, with lots of people I didn't know. I was offered weed multiple times and declined them all. The amount of support some of them gave me was truly lifting, and I had lots of fun without drugs. 
This is only my 3rd day of being sober and the future seems brighter. I am starting to notice changes, but the road is still long and rough.
I really do feel better already, and I wanted to share my experience to get it off my chest.
Thank you, stangers, for reading and being here of us. These small gestures makes the world for us, and I've never been more motivated to make a change in my life.

I got into my first real relationship about 3 years ago, we were together for almost two years. It was amazing, I never thought I would match with someone like I did with her. A crazy thing was how spiritual the connection felt. Felt like I knew her from past lives and we were both into esoteric hidden occulted information. I didn't believe in a higher power before her and she forever changed me because now I do. Times were so simple, we just had fun and stuff. Of course there was issues in the relationship that ultimately made us break up, a lot of it was my fault even, however she was my first love and it still pains me to say that after 1.5 years of being broken up I still think of her.

At first I just used weed to cope with it. I always had a wax pen with me and numbed out the pain of the heartache with that. It took getting sober for me to finally process some of the trauma associated with the breakup. I have been sober for a while, but why does this weigh so heavily on my hurt. Every few months I'll get a text saying ""hope all is well"" but that's about it.

Obviously I gotten over her a little and am hopeful for a relationship the future will bring. I don't know why this makes me want to smoke. Even after being sober for almost half a year and single for 1.5 years. 

I don't know if anyone has dealt with something similar, like past traumas surfacing after not being sober for so long.

I'm 25M and moved to Oregon because of my job in September 2020 from a non-legalized state and got caught up in weed hard. Started small of course but then I started to smoke nightly to fall asleep and the eventually just started saying screw it and waking and baking in the morning.

Tried to pick a 'smoke night' at first to start to wean myself off but it was never enough. Switched to vaping and dabbing because I told myself it was healthier and would be easier/cheaper. It only fueled the fire because it was easier to hide and I could bring my dab pen anywhere I wanted.

I realized the other day that I've just forgotten about all my hobbies and instead just wanted to smoke and avoid all of life's pressures. I was training HARD (15-20 hours a week) for 2 endurance races in 2019/2020 and when both of them were cancelled I stopped training to avoid any injury or burn out. Both races are back on this year and my registration transfered over. I kept telling myself whenever I smoked that I would start tomorrow or at the start of the next month. Never happened. Never would have.

So here I am smoking again on 4/19/21 looking at 4/20 deals to hop around to the next day and it just hit me that my endurance race is only 6 weeks away... I was so pissed at myself that night that I decided to smoke what I could and toss the rest. I put all my other glassware in a box and gave it to my fiance to hide. 

So far today has been the best day for me, day 1 and day 2 were full of headaches from ""withdrawal"" but likely not sleeping. And I have a scary tightness in my chest when I take a deep breath but reading other experiences hear tells me it's normal. (just tested negative for covid)

But today (day 3) my headache went away for a little bit and I was so damn BORED this evening that I went and checked on my kombucha that I'd started last year. I had forgotten about it completely, so tonight I fixed it up and hopefully I'll have some bootch in a couple weeks! 

Then I laughed because kombucha is made out of tea ""leaves"" - ironic.

It. Feels. Great. To have something I lost back, and now I want to get all of my lost life back together. I wrote down a list of my old hobbies that I wanted to get back into and will hopefully start checking them off.

I just found this community a couple weeks ago and have lurked and read tons of experiences and I will say that it's motivated me so much. 

If some people that smoked daily for 10 years are here going cold turkey and FIGHTING for sobriety then why the hell can't I. This is the way.

Anyways the first run of my training plan is tomorrow AM at 6:30 sharp, I took some supplements to help my restlessness, anxiety, and headaches tonight. AND I wrote this instead of thinking about smoking.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980601668357849}"

I started smoking when I was 12, and have been smoking religiously for the past 4 years(18 now). I smoke around 2 ounces per month (med cards homies and from CO so not shit weed either). I grew up being an only child and my parents were always out of the house, I didn‚Äôt have many friends and resulted to pot to help create a relationship. I would smoke to feel a sense of numbness and comfort as i would enjoy music and other things much more. I love weed and it has never impacted me or the relationships I have had, the only thing it hurts is my bank. I am amateur boxer, i train 6 days a week at the gym and before I would go on my runs, (around 2 a day) I would light up a joint and go for about 3-5 miles. I have anxiety and high stress, and was on prescription medication for around a year till I wanted to get off it thinking I didn‚Äôt need it since I have weed. Well I‚Äôve been 6 months off, and my anxiety and stress has gone higher but I am better able to manage it. Today is the first day and I‚Äôm struggling to find out what to do or how to relax.

I was watching a moving yesterday and couldn‚Äôt relax or fully enjoy it because I was so anxious for no apparent reason and the only thing I could assume was withdraws. My girlfriend noticed and she asked what was wrong i told her nothing and i was simply anxious. I started crying and just disappointed at myself for not know what was wrong. Im looking for any advice or help on what do to manage anxiety/stress without just smoking a bowl.

(F-22),"I believe this is my very first post on reddit, but wanted to share a little bit to encourage people in the process of trying to quit smoking.

I started smoking around 2015, I unfortunately was too naive and believed all the great information regarding marihuana use, even read the research articles used to defend legalization, and promote the idea it only has benefits.  By no means I want to communicate a message of hate towards weed, or say that I disagree with the legalization process. What I critizice is the amount of misinformation and of course the glorification of weed I have noticed mostly portrayed in social media, Hollywood, music, and so on.

So as it is common, I started smoking not very often, but somehow that escalated the second year, and even when I had some tolerance breaks that lasted from weeks to months, I always relapsed thinking ""okay, it is true, I can stop smoking anytime so I am definitely not dependend on it."" This of course was a big lie, because I believed it was so benefitial (supported by science) and that it was completely safe, till over the course of the last few years I developed an extremely anxious and paranoid personality. In addition to that, I noticed I was becoming the type of stoner  I hated: looking like a damn zombie, lazy, smoking in huge or small groups under the unique interest of keep smoking, naively considering the people surrounding me were friends. I started smoking with them on 2015, and appreciate them as well, I have loved them all these years, but hanging out turned out to be the very same thing over and over again. Also noticed the apathy towards each other, as if smoking that much made us become zombies as well.   


I started a call center job around August 2020 while studying at University, I was getting used to arrive late to all plans most of the time, not able to multitask at job, this led me to be overwhelming stressed, not being able to concentrate as much at University, my room was messier, my thoughs clouded, no desire to exercise, and the breakdown point was when I decided to end to a very toxic relationship with an abusive man. 

One day, after an extreme mental breakdown I decided to cut it off. I stopped smoking one month ago, to be very specific. I understand this is not a long time ago, but since I dropped the friends (friend only available for smoking, other friend only available every time she broke up with another dude), since I broke up with this guy myself, and just concentrated on the finals at univerisity, in keeping the job since I work from home, and started a course on theater (which is something I should have done years ago) to be honest... my life has changed so drastically to the point I cannot still believe  it. It sometimes feels as I have developed superpowers because I keep myhouse cleaner, cook healthy meals... I seriously  do not have the time to study 2 programs and keep  up working at a call center, but wow, I am actually doing it. Even started rollerskating!    
I've always though this was nearly impossible for me, but it seems this was a consequence of being too  inside a comfort zone bubble. And despite the personal beliefs/values from redditors here, in addition to stop smoking, I must admit getting closer to God has given me so much strenght to keep it up. I still fall appart every one in a while, but I can 100% assure you will get  better on a daily basis, you get more organised, plan your weeks on a timely manner, get proper sleep, and have higher cleaning standards.

I am sorry this post is so long, I highly encourage you all to keep it up! Even when the very first weeks all you can do is crying and struggle to get some sleep.

I thought I would never post in here because ""I am not addicted to weed and I can quite whenever I want"". But that's not true. I am fully addicted to smoking pot everyday I take multiple bong rips and then turn around and take some dabs out of my rig. I smoke to excess and honestly when I think about it I don't know why. I am a freshman in college working as a cyber security ethical hacker for a large organization. On top of being fully employed I go to school at night and I am currently taking 24 credit hours. My grades are doing fine and I just got a promotion at work even only being there for 3 months. This all sounds good but I smoke everyday and I work from 6-5 and then go to school 6-9 every day so I don't even know how I do it honestly. I NEVER go to school high and I NEVER go to work high. But any free time I get like doing homework or even have a mock ""hacking war"" I smoke a tone like usually 4 grams and .5 of wax a sitting and that's every night for a year. The weed hasn't effected my job or school but it has effected my social life. All my really close friends that I used to talk to I don't talk to anymore because instead of talking to them on my free time I smoke. Also my relationship with my parents is way different then it was 1 years ago. I barely talk to them because the majority of the time I am home I am high and if they ever found out that I started smoking again they would make me move. But I feel like I am super disconnected with my mom and dad the only time I talk to them is when they go to bed and I always try to make it a point to say 'Goodnight, love you"" but that's the only thing I say to them the whole day I don't come home and talk about my job or how school was because I go straight downstairs because I am to focused on getting relaxed after a long day and smoking until I go to bed and then waking up and doing it all over again. I just don't what to say honestly I don't know what to expect from this. I hate telling people my problems I never talk about anything to anyone I keep to myself do my own thing and keep on pushing, so this feels really awkward opening up to 180,000 people when I wont even open up to my own parents or siblings  or friends. I feel so bottled up I really did not know what else to do. This might seem crazy but sometimes I get so high I start talkin to my dog about all the issues that I have because that's the only living thing I feel comfortable talking too. I don't cry much I usually just sit on it and thin about it but while I am typing this in the middle of my tech class and I am silently choking up and my eyes are watering lol. But I just want to know is there someone else out there that feels the same way or at least in a very mild experiencing the same thing. I just want to stop thinking about everything honestly idk if I should even post this.

I no longer really have a craving to smoke weed. I don't have those people in my life or the physical triggers that used to make me feel like my problems would only be solved by weed. 

However instead I have a lot more emotions that I have to sit with all the time. I feel like I am angrier these days. I feel like I am a lot more lost in what I am doing, when for a while weed satisfied my desire of getting something more out of life. I feel like I have less friends. 

Weed made me feel like I was transfixed in time, floating in a bubble where the outside world couldn't hurt me. For me, I would feel so much shame for constantly returning to that bubble, while my friends and family were all moving on with their lives. Now that I'm out of the bubble though, moving forward is still difficult for me. 

I could only manage to quit weed by completely changing my life - I had tried many times before but this is the first one that has stuck. Before the pandemic, I travelled away from my home country, and when I returned I settled in a new city away from my old friends and family, and the old habits where I used to chase my highs. 

I don't know if I recommend this method, as I wouldn't say I'm day to day happier now than when I used to smoke weed.

But I will say I feel like moving forward is the only thing you can do in life. It's no life to be stuck in a bubble just waiting for the next high. Having your whole identity be based around dopamine from a drug. I'm truly happy that that's not my life anymore, it's just cost me a lot.

I was really happy to notice this. 

It was also a lightbulb moment to see because I typically would smoke when I was in a bad mood, stressed, etc. Turns out it wasn't actually helping as much as sobriety has. It also may be that my anti-depressants can do their job more adequately without THC in the picture. 

I'm missing it less and less, which is also nice. 420 was definitely a bit of a bummer, but that day I chatted with someone else who had quit smoking and that made me feel better.

I‚Äôve been on here on and off. A month ago I tried quitting weed ‚Äúfor real this time‚Äù by giving all my stuff to a friend, and it worked for a week or two but eventually I went out and bought more, and got my stash back (turns out giving my stash to them sent one of them into a weed spiral of their own). I then told myself that, because it‚Äôs the pandemic still, there‚Äôs a reason to need a crutch like weed, and that I shouldn‚Äôt be so hard on myself. 

However, last week it hit me that even if we are still in a pandemic, life is still happening. I‚Äôve spent the past year in autopilot, self medicating for my loneliness and sadness by getting as high as a kite every single night. 

I haven‚Äôt dreamt in what feels like forever, and now I‚Äôve been tracking my sleep to see that I‚Äôm getting VERY low REM cycles. I‚Äôm sure this is contributing to my incredibly heightened anxiety and paranoia in the past few years that I‚Äôve been a user. 

Every time I try to quit, I convince myself not to. I convince myself that keeping track of a streak isn‚Äôt sustainable, that cutting cold turkey will never work, and that I‚Äôll always go back. 

This time, I‚Äôm doing something different. I just got rid of probably $500 of weed and vapes. As in, I threw them out (along with a piece of paper that reminded me of an ex, got rid of that shit too). I was sort of a collector and had been so terrified to throw out my collection, thinking how I spent a lot of money on it and that I would regret it if I ever want to go back to it again. 

But I want to prove to myself that I mean business. I want to remind myself when it‚Äôs late and I get that urge that there is a REASON I wake up every morning saying I‚Äôll quit. There‚Äôs a reason that this drug has been hypnotic to me, and while it has helped me learn how to handle my anxiety, it‚Äôs time to learn how to go at it on my own. 

I‚Äôm proud of myself but I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôve been down this path so many times I fear I‚Äôll never be able to let it go. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôll never smoke weed again, perhaps in the future if I feel I can have a better relationship with it. But for now? It‚Äôs enabling my bad habits, making me feel disconnected from my community, and giving me paranoia that I don‚Äôt need. 

So for now, good riddance.",6,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9933258295059204}"
2021-04-22 16:32:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mwe25d/1_year_quitting_cannabis_the_journey_so_far/,1 year quitting cannabis - the journey so far,"Crossed a year free from MJ use a couple weeks ago, and then remembered this sub today. When I was deep in my addiction (and it was an addiction for me) I would spend hours scrolling through r/leaves with no real intention of quitting, just was curious about what other people found in leaving. I fully knew I was addicted, I just thought it wasn't an addiction that was impacting my life in any sort of large way. Yes my life revolved around getting high but I didn't lose relationships or my job, I was a full time functional pothead. But I have to say, I really didn't know the half of it.

Since my life revolved around weed, I had room for pretty much nothing else. A bunch of un-pursued passions filled my sphere but I would only stoke the fire of them by watching *other* people pursue them on youtube. Weed seemed to release enough fulfillment chemicals in my brain to supplement the hole left in my psyche by not fulfilling my passions, but eventually weed stopped working as well. And then I got to a breaking point and quit cold turkey - from smoking dawn to dusk day in, day out to quitting completely. The first two weeks were the worst in my experience. Just constantly questioning all my reasons for quitting and feeling utterly restless. After three months. I stopped thinking about weed entirely. And that's when I organically started improving many facets of my life, from passion to career.

I say organically because I didn't set out to make more art or reach a certain position at my job when I initially quit. And this was key. I didn't have expectations for what sobriety from cannabis would look like. So I wasn't set up for disappointment or the ungodly self pressure I often put on myself. In those early three months I just played a lot of video games. Like a lot, a lot. And it was really fun. I rested a lot. I got regular walks in. And then organically I started being more passionate about life, and enjoying myself in general. I know this doesn't happen for everyone, I just wanted to share my experience and what *can* be. I ended up working in a field of work I really enjoy. I started dating again (pot put my love life on hold). And best of all I became more passionate about my creative ventures like music and writing.

It's hard to look back and see all the time I wasted in a semi-awake state for years. But it's also hard to look forward. Even though I have a year, and my life in demonstrably better without cannabis, I know how easy it is to relapse on a dime for me. This isn't my first sobriety attempt, I've quit for up to three years before, but something goes wrong and I start getting pulled back in. So I'm hoping things will be different for me this time, although I don't know how they will be (I haven't faced a real negative yet this time around) But it's communities like this that help me be grateful and silly as it sounds, make me feel like I'm not alone. So Thank You. Also the name is brilliant. What kept me roped in from the very beginning when I was using daily. My biggest pitfall was being hard on myself about quitting. I mean, you need motivation but you don't need someone beating you up. I used to escape the mundane and to escape mental pain. And escaping isn't a sin in my book, I wasn't a bad person for using. I just know today I'm much happier without it. Thanks for being part of the journey r/leaves!",146,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.980749785900116}"

I‚Äôll make commitments to myself and then break them using the excuse that I don‚Äôt want to drive somewhere bc I am high, or my anxiety levels will be increased to the point that I won‚Äôt want to leave the house. 

Smoking just became such a normal part of my life.. It was my main hobby with partners and friends, I even regularly bonded over a joint with my parents. 

I‚Äôm also at the point of my life now where my husband and I are thinking about starting a family and I find myself wondering how it hat will be possible if I can‚Äôt stop smoking pot.

So I'm in a dilemma, the reason i stopped is also the reason i wanna go back. Ive got exams coming up and i have alot of notes to do because i never did them when i was supposed to (getting high). Im getting through the notes but omg my anxiety is crazy high, yesterday i smoked the last of my weed and today was the day i was meant to start working like a mad man until my exams are finished. However im behind schedule for what i wanted done and im dying for some weed, i went 26 days clean in feb/march but now all i want is some weed. 

Im so tired of it as well. Yesterday i smoked sooo much because i knew i wanted to quit to focus on my work so i wanted to finish my stash. And now literally the next day im telling myself 1 more bag, 0.5g a day that will last me 6 days and then I'll stop.... Im not gonna do this because i know its a lie, I'll buy it and then smoke it all in 2 or 3 days because i wanna ""get rid of it all so i can quit"" 

Honestly im so fed up with my mind. I hate feeling addicted to this shit, and i feel so convinced that the cravings are the hardest right now because of my exams.... So i should quit after? .... Why is my brain hardwired in thinking of every possible excuse to allow me to smoke without guilt. 

Typing this all out actually helped calm my anxiety tho, the anxiety is from exams and if there's one thing ive learned is that weed will not help me do this work. It will help me be less stressed but i wont revise properly and wont think as clear, so im not buying anymore. I need to save money cos my broke ass ended up overspending a bunch this month cos of weed. 

I think weed helps me live in the moment and to not care about the world and the consequences. It helps me see the bigger picture but thats so dangerous because it also destroys it for me by making me live in the moment. Ill workout later, ill study later, im still young, ill quit weed later, i always have these thoughts high. I gotta put a stop to this, im sorting my shit out now.

I‚Äôve been smoking almost everyday sometimes multiple times a day for the last 5 years now. 

Smoking up hasn‚Äôt necessarily held me back in my professional life as i‚Äôm finishing university tomorrow and i have a solid career at a bank but i feel like its held me back in some personal aspects. Whether it be relationships with girls or developing new friendships that aren‚Äôt solely based on smoking up together. 

I‚Äôve had the idea in my mind to quit for a few months now and would take a couple days off to start the process then I would make the mistake of smoking up again. Recently i had been dealing with some issues with schooling and my grandfather had passed away and i turned to smoking more to numb my pain until this past weekend. This past weekend my mother brought my father to the hospital because he was experiencing some pains in his stomach area, not thinking much of it i smoked up while they were at the hospital. Upon their return i asked what the doctors had to say. My dad broke down telling my brother and i that they found a tumour on his stomach and it might be cancer. Not knowing the severity of it or even if it was truly cancer my mind began to race and overthink every possible outcome because i was high. 

My dad is a strong man and no matter what happens i know he will beat this but as a promise to myself i have vowed to quit smoking up because i do not want to constantly overthink this situation, i do not want my moments with my father to be clouded by me being high and eventually forgetting times we had together, i want to truly cherish every moment we have had together and i do not think that could be possible if i continue to supress my emotions and numb myself through smoking up.

2021-04-22 09:19:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mw4kqv/11_months_off_weed_what_has_changed/,11 Months off weed. What has changed?,"Looking at the posts of this sub I see that most people who post here are in the very early phases of quitting. And that kinda makes sense because the more you get into it, the less significant the change becomes and you don't feel like talking that much about it.

Anyway, even today I still find myself questioning is it actually worth getting rid of weed for good, but as some of you know, there are people who simply can't smoke occasionally, they are either all in or all out. I am also one of those people.

Since I can't give a clear answer was it worth it neither to myself nor to you, I'll just drop a list of things that have changed and the things that haven't. The moment I smoked my last joint I had a night shift at the post office, was living at my parents house, was single, and I didn't really have much money. Most of my highs were giving me anxiety.

What has changed:
-I found a loving girlfriend, she admits that me quitting influenced her choice to be with me.
-I moved out of my parents home and rented an appartment with my girlfriend.
-As a result I have sex quite often, compared to not having it at all while being a stoner.
-I changed my post office night shift job to a food delivery job with a bicycle, which is actually a much better job in many different ways.
-I have more stamina since my heart rate got a little lower.
-I dropped out of university earlier in my life, but now I reapplied and successfully joined university, so it's my first year again, and so far it's going ok.
-I'm more open with my family.
-I stopped hiding from people and stopped being paranoid about cops getting me.
-I stopped being paranoid after getting too high that I am going to have a heart attack or die for whatever reason.
-Making it 11 months without it gave me the realization that I have some power over my own life.
-My sleep is different, I do wake up during the night once or twice, but I have dreams now. I never was a good sleeper though.

What hasn't changed:
-I don't feel much happier. Arguably I could say that I had a higher spikes of happiness while getting high, but I also had nearly suicidal moods which don't really get to me right now.
-I don't have much money even though I'm not spending hundreds on weed anymore, I guess smoking itself motivates to earn more in order to smoke.
-I still sometimes get very lazy and unmotivated.
-Sometimes life feels like lacking excitment and a little boring, perhaps more than when I had some and less when I didn't have any.
-I did not become more social, I actually lost some of my friends because of quitting, but it doesn't really hurt. After all there's a pandemic going on.
-I still want to smoke sometimes.

So as you can see even after 11 months it's very difficult to say wether life got better or worse after quitting. Though it certainly became different than it was. I was thinking about relapsing many times, and honestly I'd probably be fine, but here's the thing: when I'm high, I don't care about much things at all, I wouldn't care about my girlfriend and personally I would just go on with my life the way I did for many years. But my girl would most likely feel very lonely because I know for a fact I would become very distant, and that would be heartbreaking for her. Even if I managed to hide it from her, it would become evident. Simply hiding anything is detrimental to a relationship. So as long as she needs me, I don't think I am going to relapse. Unless for whatever reason i'd become a selfish asshole, but that would be a bigger problem than a relapse itself.

I suffer from awful social anxiety and I know for a fact that weed makes it worse.

My cognitive and motor abilities are shocking when I'm high... I think smoking is responsible for my anxiety and suicidal thoughts which is ironic because the reason I started smoking in the first place was to suppress that stuff when really it just made it worse. The depression makes me feel angry and judgemental towards other people, it stops me from properly pursuing the things I love. While I'm not a total waster, I've always worked and I go to the gym, so considering how foggy I feel in my brain everyday, I'm quite proud of what I've achieved but I know I'm not living up to my potential....all the time and money I spend on weed could be put to much better use like dancing, learning languages or an instrument.

When I wasn't smoking I'd have these mood swings, for better or worse, I'd always tell her it wasn't me because I didn't even recognise myself but eventually one day she had enough. 

I haven't smoked for 3 weeks now and the anger has just washed away, I'm not mad at people who have wronged me, I'm not mad at myself or the world and I'm not mad that she's  started seeing someone else and moved on. I'm accepting life now without the need to smoke to find that state.

I had asked her so many times to let me show her the 'new' me not even to try to win her back, but she just doesn't want to know or believe. When I wasn't in that state we were perfect, she is and always will be the love of my life. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Have they ever managed to reconnect? If so how did you go about this? I won't lose control if she won't let me, I just need to know I've done everything I can to get that chance I suppose.

The practice is to stop telling ourselves the story of what's been happening, and to fully connect with experience in this moment.

any thoughts or advice for people who used weed almost as a kickstarter? just need to get over myself and do it? or? 

any advice is helpful

More in coverage than total use, probably 3-6 hits a day, but it's ALL DAY EVERY DAY. I've been sober for 5 days now (besides the one bubbler snap I had two hours ago), after I got EXTREMELY sick on Saturday. 

I was working and was feeling kinda sick, and then all of a sudden just started feeling really nauseous and threw up into my bucket a few times. 

I felt a lot better, and given I had slammed perhaps too big a California burrito the night before, I thought I had just overeaten, maybe combined with a little sick or smth. 

But then I just kept throwing up. And maybe the half gallon of water I drank over the next 2 hours didn't help, but I just kept throwing up. And then dry heaving. 

Luckily, that job was over by 12:30, and I went home, where I felt a tiny bit steadier. I took a snap from my tiny bubbler, immediately puked, proceeded to throw up once an hour for the whole day. (Also had some from the other end, which isn't a normal symptom)

The next day, my stomach felt a bit better. By that evening, I was able to eat some ramen. I didn't throw up again. I also didn't smoke. Somehow, I was fine with this. I think the puking right after smoking helped reset my brain.  

BUT, cut to the next day, and my ROOMMATE, a moderate (2-4 times a week) user is also blasting out of both ends, and still doesn't feel great. 

I feel like a million bucks now but that's because I am strong like üêÇ compared to my puny weak roommate. 

So I don't think it was actually Cannibanoid Hypermesis Syndrome, at least... not yet. 

Because when I looked it up and started to read about it, I realized that I might be in the prodromal phase. I have overall nausea in the mornings, that go away later in the day, and I have thrown up in the morning a couple times (often after binge eating), but that's been awhile since I've been eating better. 

So anyways, long story short, I smoked a little snap to enjoy some Greek food that I desperately need (I've eaten ramen and some Mac and cheese in 5 days), and I think I'm gonna cut down to about once a week, and only a hit or two. I'm really enjoying being sober, I think I can do it! Good luck to you all, I love you!",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983685612678528}"
2021-04-21 17:23:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mvpszp/questions_about_quitting/,Questions about quitting,"Hello /r/leaves, I am currently posting from a throwaway due to career sensitivity, but I was wondering if anyone has run into a problem similar to mine and can shed some light on whether what I‚Äôm going through is normal (apologies in advance for the long-winded post). 

My partner and I recently decided to quit smoking, and are both working through some health issues - some weed related, some potentially not.

It‚Äôs been a week since either one of us smoked, and although my early withdrawal symptoms were pretty intense, they were not unexpected. I lost all appetite, lost some weight, had trouble staying focused, felt jittery, very anxious with my stomach in knots, you name it. No joke - I could probably be some kind of a case study for someone who has every weed withdrawal symptom you can think of.

Anyway, over just the last couple of days I have noticed an improvement in many of my symptoms, but one thing that has me on edge today is anxiety over my partner‚Äôs health.

Their experience over the last week is similar albeit generally less intense than mine. The big difference for them was a gastrointestinal issue that I won‚Äôt get too into, but let‚Äôs just say things weren‚Äôt solid for a couple of days, which caused some dehydration and dizziness before we figured out what was going on (still unclear if this was/is a withdrawal symptom).

At the time, with my own anxiety running very high, I found that concern for my partner‚Äôs health had me on the verge of panic every time they mentioned that they weren‚Äôt feeling well or named additional symptoms.

After a day or two, their gastrointestinal and dehydration symptoms began to improve, but today the former suddenly came back with a hint of the latter.

For myself, after experiencing improvement in my anxiety levels, this felt like I was immediately back to square one, with my stomach and throat tightening up again in borderline panic. What is going on with my partner? What if something happens? What if I can‚Äôt help? What if it‚Äôs not just something minor? These are the types of questions racing through my head.

Even before weed, I was always sensitive to others‚Äô health, but what I‚Äôm wondering now is whether my reaction is excessive regardless of withdrawal symptoms and worth noting/exploring further. 

I forget what the technical term is, but it seems like at the moment, any comments about family and friends‚Äô physical/mental health concerns are enough to send my mind racing to the worst possible scenarios, which fuels a frustrating cycle of anxiety.

Can I expect this to get better as I experience improvement in my other symptoms? Is this a normal thing to experience during withdrawal? Should I be this concerned over my partner‚Äôs health? I hope to read your thoughts and comments - as a tangentially related conclusion, I‚Äôve been considering quitting for some time and discovering this community was a major part of getting over the hump last week and deciding to finally call it quits after years of on and off periods of heavy smoking. Thank you all so much - you‚Äôre amazing and inspiring!

TL;DR - Haven‚Äôt smoked in a week, starting to feel better, but anytime my partner mentions that they‚Äôre not feeling well in any way, I spiral into intense anxiety, despite improvement in most of my other symptoms. Is this normal? Is it normal for my partner to be having recurring/persisting gastrointestinal issues from quitting? Should I do anything in particular to address the issues were both experiencing, or just be patient and ride it out?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974381923675537}"

I've been sober for over three years with little relapses here and there. I don't even like the word relapse though, because I'm to the point now where a relapse doesn't send me back to the addict I was, it just reminds me why I stopped doing this crap to begin with.

I haven't been able to smoke for a long time due to asthma, but recently I bought some of those Wyld gummies. I thought maybe I could take one every now and then to help with sore muscles from my job. The funny thing was I bought them on 4/20 without even realizing it was 4/20 until I happened to glance at my phone while I was waiting in line.

The one night I used them, my appetite was so out of control and I ended up eating WAY too much chocolate. I totally forgot about the fucking MUNCHIES. They are very real and I hate they my body is basically being tricked into being way hungrier than it should be and for food that's not good for me.

I got that ""nothing is good enough to focus on"" feeling that I don't like. Maybe it's an edible thing, but the ""high"" me sort of feels good but then has me going back and forth from The Office, to Youtube, to you name it, without being able to just enjoy something and focus on one thing. I don't like when I have less control over my mind, and all THC does is give me less control over my mind, with a little bit of a euphoria lie.

I think the reason I end up relapsing is because of this dumb mindset that has stuck with me which is when I am doing something like just being outside enjoying the nice weather,  I think ""Well this would be so much better if I was high!"". And then it turns out, nope, it isn't, that's a LIE.

So I decided to toss the gummies this morning, but then I thought ""I'll have one last one and toss the rest"". Dumb.

I forgot why I used to like this. Did it seriously make me this dumb? I can't focus on anything, and I'm about to go for a long walk just to get this shit out of my system. The ""high"" isn't even that great, and the cons far outweigh the pro of being high.

From now on I will forever know that this feeling wanting to be high to enjoy something more is just a LIE. Nothing worth doing should be so easy. I could wake and bake which will leave me foggy brained, hungry as shit, and lazy, or I could get up and do a hard work out, and EARN that euphoria and feel good about having an awesome, productive day.

One huge lesson I have learned which doesn't just go for this stuff, is to NEVER compare myself to anyone. It doesn't matter that some famous musician I like can smoke weed all the time and be massively successful. Good for them, good for anyone who can use weed without any issues, but that's not ME! And I'm guessing most of the people reading this can completely relate. You see other people doing it with no issues and you wonder why you can't be the same. Well, you just aren't, but that's okay.

I was sober until college and I was completely fine with it, which means I can be sober the rest of my god damned life and be completely fine with it.

Sorry for any grammar errors or poor writing, as I am still coming down from that damned edible.

Edit: I forgot to add that I hate how much thc ruins my sleep. I could sleep for 9 hours and still get out of bed and feel tired. I hate that. I never want that feeling again. I want to wake up and feel fucking alive.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989866614341736}"

I've been in this thread for \~2 years. I've smoked since 14 and i'm now a 22yr old(F) now pursuing my PhD in neuroscience. I have been attempting to quit since quarantine initiated, and i noticed my cart usage was up to roughly 1 gram every 2 days... ive quit and relapsed and quit and relapsed time and time again. going on 9 days today, this very important trend that keeps me relapsing and i thought it may be helpful to illustrate it to some people:

picture it like a lil circle with stages: it starts with *""weed is fun and interesting"".* weed is a novelty, an exciting escape. after \~1 week of use, however (and less as i continue my cycle), this honeymoon phase rapidly deteriorates. this turns into a ""*weed is boring""* phase. i'm constantly seeking to re-up. i'm never high ""enough."" i always need more (this is a combo of tolerance and my anxiety surrounding weed amping up). then, i hit the next, worst phase, called *""weed is the worst and i want to die"".* this phase is characterized by smoking with guilt, hiding use from my partner, sneaking out to buy more, never feeling satisfied, being completely controlled by my urges and desire to use. after a HUGE breakdown and a crash, i quit. the honeymoon phase of quitting ends, and then, two weeks later, i am so proud of myself for quitting i re-enter the ""hmmm.. weed is interesting..."" phase. and the cycle starts all over.

its like i completely forget the anguish, self-hate, and guilt weed use brought me. i recognize that in order for me to sustain abstinence, i needed to recognize the self-fulfilling cycle i kept reliving, and i need to somehow be extra conscious when i reach that quitting plateau where you're proud of yourself for your work but the honeymoon of abstinence begins to wear off. that, my friends, is where the real work begins.

Me? Bored of the feeling of getting high mostly. That‚Äôs my biggest motivation to quit, I simply don‚Äôt enjoy it nearly half as much as I used to. I don‚Äôt even feel euphoric when I smoke anymore, I don‚Äôt feel care free. I just feel blunted, cold, numb, nothing which warrants me using and perhaps this is inevitable after using daily for 7 years.

I‚Äôm not that excited to be sober, but what‚Äôs the point in continuing to smoke when there‚Äôs no enjoyment left from it? I can‚Äôt moderate if I do have it, I think my life is pretty bad so maybe that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt enjoy it.

I look at someone like Snoop Dogg, and sure I can see why he‚Äôd feel good from it still, I mean the dudes a multi millionaire, has a family, away from crime now and has a serious following and a fantastic life, he would smoke to chill and it‚Äôs basically part of his identity - there‚Äôs many celebs too.

2021-04-21 11:19:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mvhxyt/advice_for_getting_through_the_first_couple_days/,Advice for Getting Through the First Couple Days,"From my experience, the first couple days after deciding to give up weed were the hardest so I figured I would share a couple of the things I did to help myself go through those couple of days. After the first day or so, you feel refreshed, but your mind tells you ""oh, I feel great now. I should celebrate."" That is NOT what you should do. The first couple days are the hardest because it is a time where you haven't started to feel the true benefits of not smoking weed, but you still have to stay strong nonetheless. Here are some things I did during this period to help pass the time:

1. Video Games

The worst part about these couple days is just having free time. Free time leads to boredom and boredom leads to getting high. My advice would be to fill this time with activities that are very involving. I used video games a lot, because it is something you can sit down and play for hours at a time without getting up once. Of course, not everyone likes video games, but the principle still holds true‚Äîjust find something that takes up a lot of time, whether that be working, reading, watching a movie, doing homework, etc. 

2. Wake up Right When Your Alarm Goes Off

Many of you have probably seen the video of the Navy seal explaining why you should make your bed every morning. The act of accomplishing a task to start your day, no matter how small, will give you a feeling of accomplishment that will leave you wanting to accomplish more. I used to wake up to my alarm and then sit in bed for another hour just scrolling through my phone. DO NOT DO THIS. When your alarm goes off, get straight out of bed and go right into your morning routine. For me, it was showering because it's pretty hard to go back to bed after showering. Regardless, this will give your day a new feel right from the start, because chances are this isn't something you were doing when you were smoking weed. 

3. Exercise, and exercise HARD

Going to the gym was typically what I would choose to do. However, whatever you end up doing, make sure you get one of the best workouts of your life in. Whether it be running, lifting weights, playing a sport, make sure you are SORE after. Your body reacts to this by giving you the urge to eat or drink healthy foods to RECOVER from the activity. The key word there is RECOVER‚Äîsmoking is not a healthy recovery. By exercising, you give yourself the same feeling as step 2, a feeling of accomplishment (you worked out! Good job!). Now that you just completed that grueling workout, let that feeling of accomplishment transfer over to your diet. You don't want to eat 2 boxes of zebra cakes after you just worked out, right? (Hopefully not). Think of those zebra cake boxes as two grams of weed. You are improving your overall health by working out, so why would you want to throw that down the drain to smoke? 

4. Trust yourself! It gets better!

Quitting weed is hard! In today's world so many people focus on decriminalizing marijuana and painting it as some sort of miracle drug that they forget that it can destroy people, families, and lives. If you are already in this sub, you have already made a step in the right direction. The first week after quitting weed is the hardest. But once you get through this part, you will soon start to notice the benefits of giving up weed (clearer thinking, much more productive, much more healthy, etc.) and those will make it much easier to suppress that urge to get high. Just be confident in yourself and hold yourself accountable! There is a light at the end of the tunnel!",21,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8332777619361877}"

I currently smoke once a day after work (1g joint)

I smoke because it‚Äôs fun but it‚Äôs also something to look forward to after work. my sleep has been really bad and everyday I wake up tired.

I‚Äôve spoke to my therapist but that hasn‚Äôt helped much. It‚Äôs like I want to quit but at the same time I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs sad because sometimes I feel so 50/50 as I‚Äôm packing a joint. Should I? Should I not? It really leaves me high but feeling disgusted in myself for being that way. I lie to people telling them I‚Äôm not smoking but I am. I used to be religious but that stopped because of the guilt of smoking. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm addicted if I‚Äôm only doing one joint a day but I think I am because it‚Äôs so difficult to stop. I wish I didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô mentality some days but still manage to bring myself down for smoking the morning after I smoke.

Am I addicted to the feeling I get from being high? Or am I addicted to smoking?

I have stopped smoking for 20 days now. I had massive anxiety attacks before quitting and they got so bad after quitting, that I honestly thought about killing myself. Now the heart-racing is gone, but what still stays is my constant overthinking. I just cannot live in the moment and take things as they come. Through smoking every day, I began constantly planning my days or what happens next. If I would have something to do, that ist not fun, I would think ""later you get to buy some and just smoke"" to make me feel better. I did this so often, that even now, when I already quit, my mind still functions like that. And as there is nothing (endorphine-wise) to look out so much for like smoking was before, I feel some kind of void. The last days, when I really felt bad the whole day before, because of anxiety-attacks and overthinking, once it started to get better, I realized I was just so happy. I felt like I was just right in the moment, not thinking about tomorrow, about what I will do later or so. I was just so happy about getting rid of the anxiety. Now I just feel.. kind of flatlining. I don't feel nearly as bad as the last weeks, but also not really better than that. The fact, that I think so much scares me so hard, that I start  constantly overthinking about how to get rid of that. It's like a downward spiral into anxiety and overthinking. I just can't really think of anything that would make fun... or make me happy.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong.. I'm so relieved, that the anxiety is near to over, but the next problem arrives.

&#x200B;

Any tips? Is this normal? I know, some kind of apathy is normal, but somethimes I am so scared of being mentally ill, that it frightens me.

They say it takes about 3 months or so, after stopping use, for the THC to gradually be eliminated from your fat cells (I always wondered if this is the reason THC users don't have as bad of a time as users detoxing off other drugs that are eliminated in hours or days. e.g. alcohol). 

So if it takes about 90-100 days to eliminate THC from a human body then it's about a 1% improvement each day. 

I'm not saying everyone will be back to 100% mental clarity after 3 months. I know a lot of people have a different experience and it can take less time for some, or longer for others.

I quit to see if it would help my depression and it didn‚Äôt. I quit to see if it would make me feel more in touch and not disassociated with myself but it hasn‚Äôt really. At this point it seems changing who i am is dependent upon my mentality but I‚Äôm wondering if that mentality can even change without external help.

Feel free to comment your own personal improvements!! We all have a lot to celebrate by staying sober today.

1. My anxiety has toned down SO much. I'm still working on highway driving.. but no more fear driving around town or talking in work meetings.
2. Better focus and motivation at work. I'm not making dumb mistakes anymore and I'm killing it at work!
3. More control over appetite. No more binge eating for me!
4. More present in my day to day life.
5. I find joy in life's little moments now instead of being bored and just getting by until my next bowl
6. More money in my pockets!
7. No more making excuses to get out of things just so I had more time to get high
8. DREAMS!! I didn't dream for 2 years straight... Almost every night I have a very detailed dream now and I even started a dream journal :)
9. Clarity. I don't lose my train of thought nearly as much anymore
10. I lost weight now that I have the time and energy to work on myself
11. Better relationships with my friends. I go out of my way to make calls now instead of being annoyed when I had to skip a session to talk to someone sober
12. More on top of my adult responsibilities. Doctor, dentist, eye, hair, etc. All scheduled weeks in advance no issues
13. My blood pressure is lower than before. I take blood pressure meds so this lowering is a big deal for me
14. No more random racing heart beats. 
15. I can enjoy more complicated fun activities now like reading a complex book or video game without getting overwhelmed trying to focus while high
16. I never have to worry about my clothes smelling like weed again!
17. I exercise regularly now. All the time I wasted smoking can now be spent on running!
18. No more fear of someone catching you. If a rando knocks on my door I don't have to worry about being high and answering anymore 
19. Control of my life again. I'm not a slave craving 24/7 now. Sure days like 4/20 come up but I'm not dying to break my sober streak anymore.

I quit for good on January 18, 2021:","Today is my first sober 4/20 in 20 years. I've tried to quit many times, and every time I tried, I would smoke or vape ""one last time"" before I would go to bed. ""Tomorrow I'm done."" Every single day, every single night for the past 5 years. My life was not moving forward, my memory was fading, deep in debt, stuck in an endless circle of too much shame and guilt to ask for help. I never really said to myself ""I am an addict."" In December, 2020, I decided to ask Reddit. And then I found r/leaves. This changed my life, and this is how I quit:

&#x200B;

* WHY AM I AN ADDICT: I endlessly lurked here in leaves, read so many warming and heartbreaking stories, and I realized that I am a recreational addict using it to cover up my unsuccessful life (I am in my late 40's). I wasn't using weed to mask any trauma or any tragic loss which might require more than just reading, I simply fell into the warm blanket of being high to forget how pathetic my life actually was. This was my shame.
* THE MECHANISM: We all know the brain is a very powerful thing, so why couldn't I stop using just by willpower? Because I am an addict. So I started reading and listening to podcasts about what addiction actually is and what happens inside the brain of an addict. The simple answer is that addictions reward us with the release of dopamine - the ""pleasure chemical"", and we chase that reward, that fix at the cost of everything. Our cave man ancestors developed the reward system as a mechanism to survive - sugars and fats and procreation gives you dopamine, rotten meat and no sex makes you depressed, sick, or hungry. Pretty simple. Today, we have chocolate on every corner (= gluttony), sex on every screen (= porn addiction). Here in r/leaves, our brain releases dopamine when it anticipates and gets THC. We are rewarded by consuming weed. WE ARE REWARDED BY NOT QUITTING, and this is why it is so hard to quit.
* FORWARD: If addiction is really just neurochemistry, could I switch my brain's reward system to release dopamine for something else? Could this be instant? What other ""addictions"" could be the reward replacement for THC? During 2020 I decided I need to address my finances. I had no savings, barely any retirement, lots of credit card debt. Weed prevented me from taking money seriously, but I knew I needed money for my future. On January 18, 2021, I made the conscious decision to try and change the dopamine release trigger from THC to BTC. And it just f\*cking 'clicked'. I think I was really ready to finally change my life, and now I am a cryptocurrency fiend.

This is what worked for me. I first had to recognize my underlying problems, then I had to understand the mechanics of how things work, and finally find an alternative dopamine target to take me in a different direction. I know this seems so simple that I could just switch things, but I couldn't have done it without having a replacement for my weed addiction. I am lucky that crypto was an almost perfect fit, the endless rabbit-holes occupy my recovering brain. I was taught that money isn't everything, so perhaps that's why it was never a priority in my life. Now, however, I'm hungry (but not greedy) to get more, to learn more, to invest more, and to try and get back those 20 years that I spent blissfully detached in that cloudy warming blanket. Good luck to you all, I hope this helps some of you because you all have helped me. Here's to a sober 4/20!",6,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976166486740112}"

2021-04-20 18:57:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mv2q1h/102_days_and_counting/,102 Days and counting,"I finally broke 100 days. I really am shocked - I haven't had this long of a streak since 2014. The most I've done since then was 77 days, and under that was maybe 2 weeks, if that. While there have been many positive effects that have risen into my lif, there have also been some negatives.

First, I've realized that I still crave weed, even after this long, and would not doubt that this could last for even years into my sobriety. I am prepared for that, but its eye opening to realize that others who have been subdued by drug addiction and have stayed consistently sober for even decades could still fall to the perils of this horrible enslavement.

That really has been the only negative, though it has positively effected my life knowing this information. I'm able to empathize with others who consider themselves addicts, especially the ones who have been sober for a while.

Now, the positives. There have been A LOT, and I keep feeling better daily. First, for me the most important, is my ability to express my ideas and communicate more clearly (plus processing information!). It took a few months of consistent reading and word association games, but my clarity in not only the words I'm able to conjure, but the way I'm able to express those words, is like night and day compared to Day 1.

Another amazing effect have been an increase in confidence and a decrease in negative thought and doubt. I had horrible anxiety and depression for the first few months. It was god awful. I was always questioning everything, whether that were how I interacted with someone earlier in the day, or my job performance; the critical energy I exerted every day was over 9000. Now, I'm more calm. I'm able to not be as critical, because I realized that I can only focus on the good that I am creating. It's multiplying everything with work, and I know that it continuously will as long as I stay on this path.

A few other random things - gym workouts have been better (anyone who works out under the influence knows that you think that you do better high - but that is NOT the case at all, at least with me. I just thought I did), my diet has been better, I've been able to plan better, I'm able to control my emotions better, I'm not victimizing myself, I'm finally working on getting into nursing school (which I should be going to this Fall!), I'm able to empathize better with people, I am able to spend more meaningful time with those that I love, my language learning has improved and I'm getting better at learning information in general, I have more determination, the list really goes on and on.

Some things that really helped me were the gym, reading, and connecting with people. Even if I didn't want to do any of the three above things, I forced myself to. My brain was wired to only get dopamine when I smoked - I had to rewire and completely overhaul to get to a place where I felt good when doing things other than smoking.  Because, like many of you, I was only able to have positive moments when I was high.

All in all, this has been a struggle, but the most painful experiences are really the most rewarding. If youre on day 1, 59, even 3 years, I know you can get through this. You have all of us to support you, just remember why you started this journey and what you are working towards. If you don't think you're enough and that you are worth having a life you are happy with, just remember that you have affected people more than you'll ever know and without you, the world wouldn't be like it is now. If you can't do it for yourself, do it for your loved ones. If you don't have a support system or loved ones, do it for the person that you want to become. They are waiting for you with open arms, cheering you on. You got this.

Also, just realized its 420 lmao good timing, I guess?

I was a long-term smoker and the changes over that time felt subtle but when I list them and look back on my diary check-ins, they are actually huge and life-changing.  

The biggest thing I realise and want to share is that by staying sober, I get to do the little things. Each little thing seems inconsequential at the time but they are what add up to make a fulfilling life.  Answering that call, not ""I can't now, I'll ring back sober"" but never do.  Keeping up to date with texts from friends, family and groups instead of letting them all wash over me, too late to reply, moment passed.  Dealing with work emails and tasks as they come in.  When I think of a nice or good idea, do it instead of just plan it. Even something like this post - not a chance of it getting done before.  And because I'm busy and active, I don't have time for negative storytime on repeat. So it turns out I'm not that anxious or depressed either!  

The list of life changes include:  Starting a relationship,  getting a promotion and raise at work,  reconnecting with old friends - none of which would have happened stoned and it's all down to being able to do the little things.

(20yo) I'm a very productive stoner. I get my work done, i don't smoke before having lectures or anything important and i also don't get lazy, but still, when i wake up in the morning the first thought that goes through my head is weed. 

The problem is, when i have nothing to do i just don't know what to do except smoking weed. It's the only thing that makes me comfortable doing nothing. Obviously since corona began it got worse. Right now i feel like my psyche has never been that bad. I feel borderline depressed and despite being a social extrovert my whole life, it feels like i'm getting worse and worse at talking to people. I'm just overthinking all the time and i kinda know it's because of weed.

Yesterday was the breaking point. A girl wanted to sleep with me and i just made up excuses to not sleep with her because in my head i was afraid of not satisfying her, despite wanting to. I didn't have sex for half a year because i didn't get a boner due to pressure and after overthinking for so many months i kinda built up an anxiety to have sex. 

My plan right now is obviously to stay off weed, and throughout the day it's manageable but before going to bed it's really hard for me, since i didn't sleep without weed for a veeery long time.

I really hope that i will get the joy of having sex back and not just the pressure to perform. Do you guys have any opinion on this topic?

Coming up on 4/20, I was thinking, oh what the hell, I've been a good boy, maybe I can take a few tokes this evening. My tolerance is surely so much lower so it'll be fun going to the moon and stars. But seeing all the posts of people reaffirming their sobriety and stating that they have no plans to get high today has made me want to stay sober as well.

I haven't kept count of the days because I personally find it to be sort of stressful and counterproductive (but all the best to those that do count!), but I'm somewhere close to 2 months since I decided to quit with one relapse in there.

If there's one lesson that other posts on this sub has taught me, it's that weed really is limiting. Honestly, for the past two weeks, I've been looking for a chance to get stoned ‚Äì but I really haven't had the time. I just haven't. I've either had a date or other social engagement, or plans the next morning, or company over, or work I need to get done, or any number of other things that are just mutually exclusive with getting high. And I'm really not sorry for it.

Maybe in the future, when I'm in a better place in my life and able to moderate myself, I'll smoke again from time to time. Or maybe not. If I never get high again, whether because I just don't have the time or because I just don't want to, I'll really be okay with that.

Sweating and Symptoms?,"Just to clarify, I‚Äôm on the PAWS boat, so I‚Äôve been going through the hellish withdrawal that most people are lucky enough to never experience...

Today is my 5 month mark on this journey to the depths of darkness with PAWS. I‚Äôve been suffering a lot less these days compared to last month which hit me with my worst wave so far. 

I was feeling a lot better last week, but about 2 days ago, I felt so good that I decided to work on some ‚Äúweed procrastinated‚Äù house labor I had laying around for a year. The day was hot, and as I worked on filing a metal panel, I started to sweat like I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt in years. But I felt good, my heart rate was good, everything felt ok so I proceeded working. I ended the day with a nice unintended workout, soaking wet in sweat, but feeling like a million bucks. Since I started this PAWS journey, I haven‚Äôt felt like exercising ever, so this is the first time in 5 months that I‚Äôve had any real workout and sweat.

Then during that night, I started feeling weird again, like a new wave was coming. I had the video game perception feeling, brain fog, all the usual stuff. Then I started feeling kind of weak, and with a bit of chest pain. When I went to bed, my whole extremities started tingling (which is also a normal thing with PAWS), but this time, my heart was pounding but in a slow manner that I haven‚Äôt felt before. I checked my pulse, and it was in the 45-50 range. I‚Äôve been to the cardiologist during this PAWS process, and had holter test, echo, ecg, stress test, and everything came out healthy as it can be. My holter test recorded 47bpm during sleep, which my cardiologist says is normal for me being a healthy 31yo male, but for the last 2 days since the workout, I‚Äôve been having a resting rate of 45-55bpm, rarely in the 65bpm range if I get up and walk. I even saw 41bpm when I fell asleep yesterday and that kind of freaks me out. I also been having extreme dizziness when I stand up, I feel like passing out (I had this some months ago but it went away). It feels like now its all the contrary to the usual racing heart everyone experiences. It‚Äôs like my heart doesn‚Äôt come to speed when it should. 

Since the workout, an old friend also came back to visit, the zaps and jolts that wake you up in the mist of going asleep. So yeah, I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep the last 2 nights being awakened multiple times by jolts with chest pain and dizziness.

Just wanted to see if anyone else here has had a similar experience. I don‚Äôt know if I could still be storing THC in my fat (I smoked a whole cart per week in my last month of use), and thc still gets released into the bloodstream by burning sweat? I have an appointment again tomorrow with my cardiologist, I hope I‚Äôm just freaking out over nothing.",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6027349233627319}"

Look up SIBO and search up how weed can fuck up your digestive system. It's the reason why you might develop lactose intolerant, extreme gas 24/7, no appetite throughout the day and crazy munchies at night and the shit don't even digest til next morning. Really fuck up the quality of life.

Remember your gut is your 2nd brain, if it's not happy there your brain n body won't be either. 


On the plus side. Quitting cold turkey, stop eating lactose/sugary, and warm shower can help.

I have almost quit weed for 10 months now after smoking a gram a day for about 2 years. During this, I have tried two different studies, both of which I already quit after one semester,  because I'd rather smoke weed and play videogames with friends than work on my life.

 I would have some periods of time stopping  for about a month or so, promising my parents I would stop forever and getting back into it after smoking once with friends or being weak and bending over to my addiction. 
My last attempt of quitting weed (before my current streak) I promised myself I would only smoking once, on 420. 
But ofcourse soon after that I was back into smoking weed daily, sitting alone in my room doing jack shit, all day long. 

Like many people on this subreddit, i was depressed and sad and didn't even know it. To me I felt great and was happy but only when I smoked.  I always woke up depressed as hell, thinking i was done smoking weed and ready to change my life for the better but at the end of the day though, I always had a joint in my mouth.

Everything I do to manage my sobriety is starting to go from making me feel good to being a chore. I think struggling with sleep is the underlying issue, but it‚Äôs started to create a snowball effect where I‚Äôm now slipping into old patterns of behaviour, conducive to my usual attempts at staying away from cannabis.

I‚Äôm finding it very hard to stay calm and grounded. My mind is constantly ruminating, I‚Äôm more prone to irritability and I have so much energy that at times, I can‚Äôt stop pacing around and talking to myself. I don‚Äôt really know how much of this is withdrawal and how much is down to my own emotional issues that I‚Äôve had ever since I can remember.

I‚Äôm not sure how to cope. Trying to meditate when I feel like this is like doing a line of ‚Äúanother drug‚Äù and then expecting to fall asleep. My affirmations only do so much and exercise just seems to make it worse. Unfortunately the increasing amount of stress coupled with the struggle to properly soothe myself, has built up to the point where last night I succumbed to one of my other addictive behaviours; spending money I can‚Äôt afford on a takeaway I didn‚Äôt need.

Unlike what appears to be many who quit, I actually binge-eat more when I don‚Äôt smoke, as a way of replacing how I deal with stress and boredom. Generally, it‚Äôs not long before these cravings are followed by the urge for ‚Äúanother drug‚Äù and I end up binging on that as well 2-3 times per week. These addictions are something that scare me so much more than cannabis, because they tend to lead me down a very dark road of depression.

Last time it go so bad I planned to hang myself, I even bought the rope and everything. That‚Äôs actually why I decided it was a good idea to relapse. But I want this time to be different, I can‚Äôt afford to keep making any of these mistakes anymore. I want stability.

Nothing particularly triggered it, I was feeling happy and I guess the sun encouraged me to, plus I planned a weekend with a friend. Anyway, so as always one day turned into 5 in a row, and I‚Äôm much unhappier than I was the day before relapsing.

There was a point in time I would smoke and feel euphoric, I would think creatively and enjoyed being high. But that was years ago now (25M) I guess I‚Äôve matured, I can see getting high as a fun activity anymore, it‚Äôs a distraction which makes me unproductive, burnt out, feeling groggy and tired and depressed and anxious, I don‚Äôt enjoy the feeling of being high anymore, and it‚Äôs taken 7 years to be honest about it. (As mentioned weed probably lost it‚Äôs thrill 4 years ago)

So whilst I do feel bad wasting money again and relapsing, I‚Äôm at least happy that I can get back on the road to recovery, normally when I relapse it would‚Äôve taken months/years to come with same conclusion.

 I'm over a month into my journey. Probably almost a month and two weeks. But weirdly, during midnight, I dreamt about smoking an old stash with friends (I have no old stash irl), but basically it was like my normal dorm life smoking. Smoked all night with friends, watched TV, weed everywhere, etc. 

What'd amazing is even in the dream, I ended up questioning why I quit my break. I hated having to smoke more to get more high, because I had killed my tolerance. I hated how messed up the room was with weed and paraphernalia everywhere, and everyone coming around to smoke or ask for papers. I hated finding joints I had rolled and forgotten in random places. It was just a cringe dream. I enjoyed the socializing and experience in the dream, but still subconsciously hated everything about it the more. 

This is also the first time I'm dreaming about weed since I quit. It's weird the dream happened midnight of 4/20. Maybe just a coincidence, but I'M GLAD IM TOTALLY DONE WITH WEED. I never thought I'd dream about weed and still not crave it. Now, I know it's 4/20, I'm like; meh. Just another day. My journey still continues. 

I've been trying to quit and failed for over 2 years. Longest I've ever made it being 3 months, from smoking heavily and daily for over a decade. Now I have no doubt I'll pass those 3 months this year, and can't wait for how I'll feel and how much more improved I'll be as a person, when I reach my 3 yrs and beyond mark. 

I guess it's just like a journal post for myself, and anyone reading. Quitting and forgetting about it for good is very possible. No matter how hard you think is it. It's all in your head, truly. Be determined to say; bye, for good, and you'll grow as a better person. 

I read sometime in this sub, that there are no super powers from quitting, that it's just your real true self coming back. That's true. Being on weed and being sober is like having double personalities. The weed you, and the sober you. The real you is the sober you, but weed you had pushed out the sober you for however long, that it takes about the same time or half for real(sober) you to return. 

I'm still not 100% me(the bright, brilliant, goal getting kid I used to be), but I know I eventually will be, and will be better, because eventually I'll grow myself and that'll be growing my true/real self. We've all got this üí™üèæ",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9405861496925354}"

2021-04-19 23:21:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/muhjso/day_8_no_weed/,Day 8 no weed,"I have been smoking weed for 6-7 years (started at 22) - at first it was the greatest thing i had discovered. i was loving life while high, feeling all the effects, and feeling good about my new ""thing"".

At first i was just smoking when i was around my cousin, then my brother started to buy for him which then lead to weed being always accessible to me. as the months passed the use got more frequent, transitioned from joints to bongs, smoking a few times a day.

the reason i loved smoking was because of how intrigued i would be with the world and how it works and i felt like while i was high i was doing mad research about the real world we live in. I then started to grow sour with the world, realising what it really is and how corruption runs rampant all over and inequality is everywhere.

this combo started to make me hate the world, and people. i felt depressed, saddened. and then when id smoke weed, id be ""happy"" momentarily.

the weed then became an escape from reality for me.

i became unemployed for around 3 months. in and out of some jobs, leaving work early to go smoke.

On top of all of this, we have shit weed in Australia - every now and then we would come across some chronic, the point where my use grew dramatically was just 2 years ago after my cousin was murdered. i was smoking around 8 cones a day just up until 8 days ago. because of the shit weed and my bad habit.

my gf stuck by me this whole time - even when i was a bum and a shit kicker (i may not have stuck around if the tables were turned) her loyalty and belief in me has helped me. and i was sick and tired of being sick and tired.

i see some posts mention remove yourself from the situation and friends that smoke. i agree this does help, but for for me these past 8 days i have been going to my other cousins house where they smoke and i have not touched it (was very close until my cousin urged me not to), i thought id like to test and strengthen my willpower, and also just wanna hang out with my mates. my point is that these tips help, but they will never truly make you change. you literally have to be over feeling the certain type of way. once you yourself are over it - you will make the change that you need.

for me initially - it was a fear of being sober and thinking how am i gonna behave while sober. it scared me. then i thought to myself i was sober before and i was fine. i will be fine.

its only been 8 days - but i. wanna keep going. also loving the energy coming back and feeling like i can do anything at anytime.

also procrastination - i was bad, i would make plans in my head, think of something cool/productive to do and then smoke and then do nothing. 

Afroman - because i got high was literally me.

2021-04-19 20:10:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mue8mf/my_story/,My Story,"First post on reddit. I just found this page and had to create an account so I could join the conversation. This might be a long post (sorry) because I have a lot to say. I am 3 days sober after smoking 1.5-2gs a day in a bong for 5 years.

I'm a 21 yr old female who fell in love with a stoner in high school (still with him after 6 years). Smoking weed was a great time for the first 2 years, and I did it socially and without any withdrawal symptoms. By my senior year, a lot of shit went down in my personal life (divorce, death, cheating, lost my best friend) and I started to abuse the drug because of it. Over the next 3 years, I developed an extremely unhealthy relationship with the plant. Almost a year ago, I became a medical marijuana patient in my state. 

The things nobody wants to tell you:

I lost all confidence in myself. I developed a pretty intense case of social anxiety which led me to lose a lot of friends and weaken my relationships with those I care about the most to this day. The depression and anxiety came along with it all. I have a hair-pulling tick (trichotillomania) that I don't know is a result of my mental deterioration or not - but I believe it to be. I lost my ability to use my words the way I intended and to get my feelings across accurately. My short-term memory loss became very obvious and affected work, school, and relationships. Hell, I completely changed my major in college because I refused to stop smoking so much. I cough up black shit every time I smoke and even now after I have stopped. I would ignore the feeling of hunger in my stomach because I was too lazy to get up and make food. I would get panic attacks if I even came close to running out. I think I might have a case of CHS too - because hot showers became very very very common for me (I'd take at least one shower or bath daily) and provided a sense of relief for my stomach pain (very weird stomach pain that only hit me in the morning for like 10 minutes and would go away for the rest of the day). The most painful symptom was migraines.

My theory behind cannabis and migraine correlation:

I have had migraines with aura ever since I started smoking at 15. I got the first one at 16 with every symptom in the book: tingling hands, numb fingers/tongue, light sensitivity, disorientation, inability to speak/think correctly, the worst fucking headache you could possibly imagine, nausea, and vomiting. For a long time, I refused to believe that it had any correlation to smoking weed, but the migraines only started after I became a daily smoker. I had maybe 5-6 of these migraines in high school (so bad I went to the hospital) and then they went away for about 2 years once I graduated (still smoking heavily throughout all of this). 3 months ago they started up again.

3 days ago I experienced a mini migraine (aura present but I was able to knock it down with rizatriptan, food/water, and sleep). This migraine was significant because I KNOW it was due to smoking weed. The medical buds I smoked were strong on the head high - (gave me that headache that you sometimes get with a strong Sativa blend) and I was complaining about the high all day. Frankly, I didn't like this bud and the way it made me feel. The migraine started at 7 pm after not smoking since 2 pm. (I was at work at this point or I would've smoked again) and it truly felt exactly like a headache from what I was experiencing earlier in the day was turning into something worse. So, since 2 pm on Friday, April 16th, I haven't smoked a bowl because I am damn near terrified of giving myself another migraine. 

Withdrawal Symptoms:

Since Friday, I experienced another mini migraine on Sunday (with aura) that I believe might be the result of the beginnings of my withdrawal. I have had a headache (like I can feel the tightness of my brain), light sensitivity, and a slight disconnect with the nerves in my hands since Friday. 

(I know this could all just be the aftermath of the migraine from Friday, but it could also very well be withdrawal symptoms for me - I don't fucking know!)

In the past 72 hours, my dreams have become vivid and I can remember them, my memory is slightly sharper, I feel more confident communicating with people, I've cried quite an embarrassing amount of tears of joy, and my appetite gets stunted every time I try to chew and swallow - which has led to some nasty constipation. 

In conclusion,

I am writing this essay of a post because I am fascinated to know if anyone on the Internet can relate to any of this. I have felt so alone with my problems (my boyfriend doesn't have an abuse issue as I do) and it's made it really hard to get through it by myself with a stoner in the house who I love and am committed to being with. I am 99% certain that smoking cannabis heavily for the past 5 years has led to a migraine/headache issue in my brain, and I am experiencing this in my withdrawal symptoms too. 

The only good thing to come out of this is that I know I wouldn't have been able to stop and snap out of my lifestyle unless something medically debilitating forced me to. I am happy and proud to be 3 days sober and I plan on taking it one day at a time from this point out. Let's just hope that the migraine symptoms go away forever.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992107152938843}"

It's definitely easier not having the supplies for smoking. Committing to not having that around.

STAY STRONG! 

For the past 8 years, i have been addicted to weed... I have smoked daily up to a point we're i broke down... Everything went down hill, where I reached my lowest of lowest point in life. I have been excluding myself from my friends and family, always needed an excuse to go home quickly... Always no money, up to a point we're i was beyond broke, and stole money from my brother and my parents... I felt guilt and shame, ""how can I continue living my life like this?"" ""I am just a piece of trash..."". 

Throughout these 8 years, i have tried to quit many many times... My longest so far was 9 months, when I forced to quit because studying abroad in Singapore... It was one of the happiest moments in my life were i swore, once coming back I WONT TOUCH IT AGAIN... Guess what I did... Only 1 joint... It all went down hill again... From 1 joint a week, to 1,5 grams a day... 

During the beginning of corona, i regained the courage to try it one more time... And I did quit... As you guessed, for 3 months... Then I went all mad again and started smoking daily again... I was nearing my last year at my bachelor where I had to focus and write my thesis... It didn't work out for 3 months I was stuck, depressed and thought I could never do this... 

Somehow... On 20th October 2020, i had a call with one of my classmates, we knew about each other addictions... I felt ashamed, guilt was overflowing... ""If I want to do this... I need to stop weed...!!"" Without hesitation, i flushed everything down the toilet, threw away my grinder and smoking papers... Hoping this was truly the last time...

As you guys may know... Weed withdrawal sucks ass... I couldn't sleep for 3 weeks... Amnesia as fuck... Couldn't eat anything without almost barfing it up, felt shit like I was close to dying... In 2 weeks I went from 55kg to 48kg... I was pissed at my life, irritated 24/7, and hated life...although knowing these were the consequences that I needed to face... 


Continuously, it was my brother who has never lost trust in me, always encouraged me when I said I wanne quit weed... Because of him I am still able to quit to this day... This 6 months was up and down.. I found a new hobby, i finished my bachelor with a 4.0 i found a girlfriend, and she became the new hope and light in my life...

What I have learned, once you out down your back age, accept who you are, and find yourself again and love yourself again... I swear, everything will come to you. God only gives you what you can handle. 

YOU CAN DO IT TOO! NEVER GIVE UP! 

Even if today didn't work out, there is tomorrow. Everyday is a new fight, and every day is a opportunity to better your life. Love yourself ! 

Happy 4/20, hope it may be a day for you where chance comes to you ! Thank you community for always being here, reading your struggles, your achievements, your adventure has empowered me, that I can say, today is 6 months, and the next 6 months will also come!

I knew I needed to regain control of my life because every time I would have a small sad, or a bout of rage or a super intense moment of anxiety - mostly triggered by paranoia of what my current Long Distance GF may be doing INSTEAD of texting me or calling me, I'd just light up and either become stoic or just fucking reasonable again, the anxiety and the paranoia would become substantially less and I'd feel like a normal person, a person with calculated thoughts and emotions.

Today is the 8th day since I've last smoked, and all I want is to be hugged by weed, for weed to tell me not to be a crazy person, to let things go, to be able to live and allow things to flow instead of being eaten alive with rage, guilt and anxiety all the time.

I see all these posts about people feeling all healthy and vital and they've got this impressively suspicious hold over their mental health since they've given up smoking and I'm seriously just here feeling like, when? When do I feel good again NATURALLY as when weed would make me feel that way?

I lost 11 pounds in the first 8-10 days which is super unhealthy. I‚Äôm on day 21 and let me tell you guys it‚Äôs day and night.

The only thing I‚Äôm still fighting and hasn‚Äôt improved much is my insomnia. I‚Äôve never had issues sleeping so I know this is also part of the withdrawal and that hopefully it will go away with time. Those 3 years sober I made the most money I ever have in my entire life, I lost almost 40 pounds and I was the happiest I‚Äôve been in a really long time. I just wanna get back to that and while I‚Äôm 1000x better now than I was 2-3 weeks ago, I‚Äôve still got some hurdles to jump through.

For me, the last couple of months, smoking weed alone represents anxiety and depression. It combines these two with being okay with boredom and having no motivation to do anything but watch netflix and play videogames. In short, this type of behavior does not help me in any way and I'm working on eliminating these habits. 

But on the other hand, smoking weed with friends is something in wich I don't associate with all of these things above. I live in the Netherlands, where smoking weed is pretty normal for my age. Almost all people around me smoke weed, and I know that it is also pretty normal in people I dont know.

The main reason I started smoking was not due to the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù but more so for the effects it has on me in terms of sleep. I‚Äôve always struggled with sleep, but to a level where I would not sleep a whole night thinking about something stupid.

It's so weird for me as it feels like I have completely forgotten who I am and how I react to certain things. I always had addictions like a gaming addiction Tobacco and also weed for the last four years. I want to stop now due to financial and also health reasons. But the reason I am writing this post is a certain girl that has been in my life over the last 3 1/2 years.

 I never thought that I would have feelings for her but somehow I have them for her now. She was interested in me when we first met. A friend of her asked me once if I had interest in her since she wasn't sure about her own feelings about me. At that time I said no though because I didn't know her well plus I also thought I wasn't the thing that she wanted or needed in her life since she has her own problems as well when it comes to family and marijuana consumption. So I told her friend that I thought that I wasn't the right person for her.

But after all we became really really good friends over the last 2 years. We talk about a lot of private things. But I've never felt like I had emotions for her, especially because she had a relationship for the last year and I was completely fine with it. Like 4 months ago they broke up 

So like a month ago I have been in quarantine due to a corona suspicion at my workplace. I asked her to bring me some weed at my place and she did that. I went outside in the evening so nobody would be around but when I saw her I realized that someone was with her. I instantly realized that something inside me cracked at that moment. I was suspicious and was wondering why suddenly this bugged me so much. I thought I had an emotional overreaction due to me being in quarantine. 

So we met up  last week Tuesday (one day before I stopped smoking weed( i smoked on Tuesday though)) and I felt like she wasn't alright either. We started talking about what bugged us and we started talking about the person that was with her. She talked about it very openly and I felt like I was completely fine with it at that moment so I asked about what made her so unsure about him and as she told me I realized that she just wasn't sure if she wanted to commit to him. I asked about what she liked about him and all she told me was positive and the things that she always wanted from a relationship. In that moment I told her that she has a chance in that situation but she isn't taking it due to having bad experiences before with relationships. 

After I left that evening I felt like I gave her great tips and was very proud of myself because I didn't try to interfere between them. 
So we met up again yesterday. We talked about him again and I told her pretty much the same thing again plus saying that I had a couple of things that I always regretted not saying. 
Later that evening the guy we talked about came around surprisingly. It was hard for me the whole time to not smoke because they did but I didn't took a single hit from the joint and I was proud about that. But with time my mood got worse and worse. Seeing bot of them sitting on the sofa while I felt like I was third wheeling was so hard for me to deal with. I started to drink 2 cups of wine and then I left in a very bad mood. 

My way back home was horrible and I felt like I wanted to scream the whole time. I got home mildly drunk and just straight up went to bed. When I fell asleep I started dreaming about her. I got up at like 4'oclock in the morning and I felt so bad. I wanted to cry, scream and I didn't know what to do in that situation. So I made a voice memo that I wanted to dedicate to her about the feelings that I had for her. I didn't want to send it instantly but after some minutes passed I just decided to send it. Then I went back to sleep

I woke up today and j felt awful, she didn't read my messages yet. I went under the shower and made an appointment at my gym right after work, just to get this topic outta my head
I went to work today feeling awful, not physically but psychologically. I felt like I started feeling things I didn't feel before. I started having diarrhea at work and after 90 minutes I told my chef that i had to leave because my stomach got worse and worse. I went home feeling awful, I just wanted to cry the whole time.

Then she answered and told me that she was surprised I got feelings for her, but she was also happy that i was honest with her. 

I don't know what to feel like right now 
I just had to get this off my chest

Mary Jane and I gave our first introductions at the age of 17 and we have remained frenemies over the past 6 years. The first two or three years of smoking were tolerable. It helped my anxiety which made me so sick to my stomach I couldn‚Äôt eat most days. My best friend at the time held onto our pipe and weed which meant it wasn‚Äôt accessible to me everyday. However, most days we‚Äôd lay around wondering where we were gonna get money for our weed, cigarettes, and gas which is all we needed to survive. Anything that we would do together was not enjoyable unless we were high. 

Once I was able to start buying the goods on my own, I started smoking daily to cope with how horrible I thought my life was. My anxiety started going up and no matter what I smoked, it left me feeling like ass. This should‚Äôve been enough for me to stay clear. However, it‚Äôs been the only thing that enabled me to slow down my racing mind and somewhat emotionally detach myself from whatever was bothering me. I found that I stopped caring about life in general when my brain was consistently fogged over. 

Every time I have managed to quit, I always ended up going back to lovely lady Jane. She was always there when I thought I‚Äôd hit rock bottom or my emotions were too strong for me handle. Ultimately though, it was always just a way to run away from life. Once I‚Äôd get back into the pattern of smoking, that was my new normal again. I did not feel human when I was sober. It really became an issue when I couldn‚Äôt go to work, do some grocery shopping or simply survive without being completely numbed. 

I went on vacation 5 months ago which left me without weed for a month. Upon my return, I felt as if my boyfriend was detached (I was overreacting as usual) which was reason enough for me to make a trip to the dispensary. I have picked up nothing but disposable vape pens and cartridges since then which is where I really fucked up. The accessibility makes it easy to smoke just about anywhere, even in my car while at work. Not to mention the amount of THC those things contain which increases your tolerance. 

I have never had a physical withdraw this bad. Quitting mentally is exhausting, anxiety inducing and boring to the point where it‚Äôs almost painful. But this time around I am finally mentally ready to embrace sober living. Over the course of this week, I have been able to happily socialize again and the cloud of darkness has lifted.  However, the nausea is unbearable. I have thrown up multiple times a day and it‚Äôs hard for me to even keep water down. When I have previously quit, I believe the nausea only lasted three days maximum.  Even though I have put the pipe down multiple times since I started smoking, I never remember how long the overall withdraw lasts for. This has me wondering if quitting cold turkey this time was the way to go or if I should‚Äôve tapered off. But with addictive personalities, there really is no tapering off. 

I apologize for this extremely long post and for any spelling/grammar mistakes but I believe this will provide the motivation I need to power through the withdraw. This sub has been nothing but helpful and I‚Äôm so gracious for all of you posting on here and leaving your stories/advice. There is nothing better than knowing that you‚Äôre not alone.

I would devour absolutely everything. thousands and thousands of extra calories every day. 

My stomach would be so bloated, I would be on the verge of vomiting, I felt like shit. I always told myself you gotta stop doing this to yourself.

All I thought about was sugar and what else I could shove into my mouth. 

When I ran out of weed, I told myself I was cut off. The amount of money that I spent on bud itself, plus the snack addiction was ridiculous. 

I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs been, I haven‚Äôt kept track. But I have absolutely no sugar cravings since I quit smoking. I don‚Äôt eat dessert after dinner anymore.

Last night I was at a cousins wedding and at the end of the night everyone was smoking a blunt on the hotel balcony. It was the first time since I stopped that I‚Äôve actually had to actively turn it down. It was way harder than I anticipated since 50 days is the longest I‚Äôve gone in many years and I thought I would easily say no. Although I was visibly uncomfortable and really wanted to smoke since I had been drinking, I succeeded! 

The only reason I quit is for myself, so if I had smoked it wouldn‚Äôt have been that big of a deal, but it feels good to say that today is day 50 instead of having to reset the clock.

For no particular reason other than I got tired of how being sober felt. Yes, I was doing a lot more stuff that I'm passionate about and I was enjoying that. But it just felt a bit... bland.

I'm in the process of the relapse and I think, ""holy f*ck, I feel alive again, I can actually see colour for once."" Thats when I realise, that is *classic* dopamine tolerance. And for some stupid reason I had been acting like that hadn't happened to me. And that *I* wouldn't need weeks or months to recover from it. God, I'm stupid. 

Sobriety had been such a tight, guilty process. I was feeling completely *meh* but was acting, towards my friends, family and, I guess, self, as if I was feeling so much better sober than i ever had when i was using. I wasnt. I'm not. But, theres a reason for that. A physiological, real reason for why getting sober sucks. And it is well documented that it takes a *while* to sort it out. 

I'm not writing this to emphasise the difficulties of getting sober. I'm writing it as encouragement that it's okay for it to be difficult. I'm a pretty classic type a or enfj (I dont really believe in personality types, but that profile is a pretty accurate description of my personality), and I felt like I should just snap into sobriety like a pregnant woman snapping back after pregnancy. Well, thats just as damaging a myth. 

It doesn't have to happen all at once, simply or easily. It can be a long, sometimes sucky process, with set backs and failures. The point is, that the journey continues. We dont give up. Every failure we learn and grow, and renew our resolve. And also, we need to accept the reality of our situation. I have damaged my body and thrown off my brain chemistry. I've created damaging behaviours and beliefs in my life. I need to do the work to repair them. And that work may not be comfortable. But I *can* fix it. 

This is getting kinda long so I'm just gonna a finish with a TLDR.
TLDR: it's okay if getting sober is hard for you. It's okay if you feel like life is bland for a while. It's just your brain's tastebuds recovering after eating insane spicy food for weeks/months/years. Or your ears recovering after a super loud concert. But it will recover.

Trigger warning - I am an addict trying to recover. If you are looking to read an inspiring tale of success, move on to the next post.


Day 1 of my journey towards recovery from my addiction.

Positive point: I did not wake and bake. 
Negative point: I felt like random crying, every other minute.

10am, I could already feel the hot flashes from my body asking for where it's dose was. 
I decided to be kind with my body. Not hate it for being addicted. ""So you want to sweat?"" I thought. Ok let's work out.
I chose a brand new work out video. As if the world was speaking to me, to my surprise the first song said ""I am strong enough to live without you"". Oh those words felt so right!
Positive point: Working out, not high, felt so right. I have proven to myself I  do not need weed to feel ""focused"" when I workout.

I went out for a walk with the family and got a small potted plant for the balcony. I only ever go to the balcony to smoke. I thought, at least now I can go there to water the plant. Trying to brake the habit of this place being the ""Let's get high"" spot.

Well, long story short, at 2pm I failed. I scratch what I could out of my grinder. And went to the balcony, not to water the plant.
Before litting up, I decided to put my mind in control and ask myself a sentence I read here: 
- Ask yourself, how does your addiction serve you? - 

2 puffs in, I realised that any puff I would take after that would be "" Me serving the addiction"". Me doing what it wanted me to: more, always more. 
Not it serving me. 

So I put the joint down and went on with my day.

I understand my addiction, the private reasons that make me to reach to my grinder, like a safety blanket for life. But the safety blanket takes over and traps me in. 
I cannot continue to live my life this way. 

Day 1 is coming to an end. It's 10pm now.
I have failed, I am not sober. But the journey is only begining. 
I will get there.
I will be kind to my body. I will not blame it for its weakness in giving in. 
It took me years to reach this level of addiction. I will not solve itself in 1 day. 
My mind, body and soul are taking this trip together. All passengers need to find their seats and buckle up before we can get to our destination. 

Let's see who drives tomorrow.

I told my parents that I've been feeling pretty shitty lately, which has been true for about the last 7-8 years where I've been struggling with depression/anxiety. 

I was self-medicating pretty heavily with weed and decided I needed to stop, quite a long time ago, and after many attempts (as I'm sure most of you can relate) I managed to quit smoking in Dec of 2019, after smoking for about 10 years. 

I relapsed for a bout a week in October 2020 during a period of extreme stress, but otherwise I can proudly say that in the 17 month period since Dec 2019 I haven't smoked at all. 

I've gone camping with some of my old friends who are heavy stoners (most of whom I introduced to weed, and amongst whom I used to be the heaviest smoker) for a week to celebrate a few of their birthdays and didn't smoke at all. I've gone to music festivals and gone out clubbing (pre-covid), all without smoking which I had never done in the past, as a heavy smoker for 10+ years. I'm quite proud of that, and I have kept my parents in the loop to let them know about my progress.

Despite that, today, after having told my parents last week that I'm still feeling pretty shitty, my dad suggests to me that I join M.A. 

He says that he thinks I'm feeling like this because I've stopped smoking weed. Honestly I am disappointed and frustrated. It seems like he feels all my problems are related to marijuana, when I have told him many times before that my heavy weed smoking was a symptom of the underlying problem; I had always been a depressive/anxious person and struggled with that, but my parents were always strongly against medication and I have never been able to get their support in getting anti-depressants or other medication. 

I know its my life and I can make those decisions for myself, but they've always been vehemently against it, telling me that they think it's basically like giving up and making excuses for yourself, and just taking a pill to try and make your problems go away is not the answer. I know that's generally toxic and bullshit, but I do agree with them to a certain extent; I think you need to be doing everything you can, ie: exercising, eating well, mediating, journaling, etc. to be responsible for your own happiness, but at the same time obviously it's hard to do those things consistently when you feel like shit and are struggling with your mental health. I'm trying really hard but I still feel pretty shitty most of the time, and it's exhausting.  

I don't really know what the main point of this post is, I just wanted to vent my frustration. I'm just upset that my parents refuse to acknowledge that I am struggling and have been struggling before my marijuana usage, and the fact that he suggested I go to MA after I've been sober for essentially a year and a half is just very frustrating.

For a lot of us, weed was an escape that helped our underlying issues, but that it turned into a crutch that ended up being a net negative in our lives. People around us won't always understand. I still feel like smoking but I know from countless failed attempts to quit that I will regret it, and I definitely do feel better now than I did when I was just smoking myself away all the time. I've made a lot of progress in my life since quitting but it's not easy. I feel like I should be on some type of medication but I'm scared that it could lead me down a worse road than I am, which is why I think I feel I need my parent's support to go through with it, but I don't have it and it sucks. Again there isn't really a point to this post, I just wanted to vent my frustrations and share my story. 

I guess if I could end it on a positive note, I will just say to anyone who's made it this far (thanks for reading this garbage) that I used to think that I would never be able to quit smoking weed. That it was impossible. I've tried and failed so many times to quit, but this time, I really think it's for good. Why? Because I feel so shitty but at the same time, smoking weed to deal with that feeling is just not something I consider anymore. It comes into my head as a fleeting, ""man I feel so shitty I wish I could just blaze up for a bit.."" but I already know too well that thought is simply false and a trap. I would feel a bit better for only a short period of time, before a cycle of self-loathing and feeling even worse would begin, and so I won't do it. And if someone like me, who was the biggest stoner out of anyone they knew, and didn't think that they would ever be able to quit smoking can do it, so can you.",19,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9914678335189819}"

I work at a cannabis club and realized after starting the job, that weed was detrimental to my overall well being. However, due to the job paying good and it being good for me because I got to socialize, I kept it. I'm glad I stuck it out, because it allowed me to build tremendous willpower and I can now confidently say that weed is no longer a part of my identity. 

It took me probably over 100 times to quit, I remember there were days where I couldn't go 5 hours, now I'm 5 months sober. It was a vicious cycle of guilt, shame, and self-hatred. I would use vape pens and they would take everything out of me.  I had no hobbies, I had no hobbies. I said it twice because that always bothered me.

Since then, a lot has changed. I enrolled in a IT program, I didn't think I would get into, but I did! I am now halfway done with the IT program and will land a internship with big tech companies in San Francisco (Salesforce, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)  In my IT program I am crushing it, 4.0, perfect attendance, completion of every tasks. This is from someone who did very poorly academically in the past.

I stopped drinking alcohol, stopped watching porn, stopped masturbating, quit caffiene, stopped using stimu1ants, I'm 550 days clean from benzod1azipines. Of course this all left a void in my life, that was very difficult to fill. I was reliant on substances to help me cope with my mental health issues. I had dug myself into a very deep hole that seemed impossible to climb out of. **But I knew it was possible, deep down inside.**

Since quitting, I have went vegan, ride my bicycle everyday, have a better connection with my family. Get proper sleep, am in control of my thoughts, am better able to articulate myself, am more confident in myself. I have a lot more money. I took a interest in esoteric/occult knowledge, started a library of books. I want to teach others about this knowledge, because I believe consciousness is being held back from progressing forward, due to the lack of this knowledge. I plan on starting yoga and meditation soon. The list goes on, all I had to do was give sobriety a chance. I finally am starting to have things I'm interested in besides substances.

I only have about two months left at my current job and will transition to an internship like I had mentioned. This will potentially lead into a career. I am very excited to close this chapter and start a new one.

I still have struggles like depression, extreme OCD, anxiety, loneliness, self-hatred, etc. It saddens me that I'm so hard on myself. It sucks that I find it so difficult to love myself! But at least I'm taking the required steps to start having a better relationship with myself. I wanted to be in a relationship badly, but realize I have to have a relationship with myself first, before I can love another. 

I get free pre-rolls, vapes, 8ths, wax, edibles, the list goes on and on. I give it all away. It's simply not worth it, I'd rather be free than high. I see customers who come in and think of weed as a panacea. They say it's their ""medicine"" yet they dab 90% THC and drink tinctures with 1,000 mg's THC. I see my co-workers spend ridiculous amounts of money on weed, just to do it all over again the week after. It's a vicious cycle of denial. I'm not saying that weed is all negatives, it has it's uses, but I just think we overdo it as a society. I want to achieve higher levels of consciousness and finally love myself, but weed gets in the way of that. I was in a very dark place and I managed to get out of it, still have a ways to go, but I'm doing it!

I'm a musician who had to turn another of my passions into a profession due to the pandemic. Editing videos (especially music) came naturally to me. But since last year I had to take a slew of different projects like weddings (fun, but oh god the sheer amount of footage) and worst - video ads.

Never went on stage without being high when I was playing drums. When I edited, I smoked up during work, during it and after. Created a whole reward system around it.

But few days ago, with the new surge in cases in my country (where its technically illegal to score, but its pretty easy), and concerns about my lung power, I decided to quit. My girlfriend was very supportive (she was pretty new to smoking up anyway). Today however, one of my clients who needs work delivered on a daily basis, changed the whole script after I had spent 2 whole days on it. And suddenly, without realizing it till later, I literally screamed at her.

Normally when high, I was able to take it in my stride. But I just wasn't in the mood today. Feeling a lot like giving up. Am writing this hoping it will let me off steam.

This is because I‚Äôve started to have mild hallucinations, frequently when I‚Äôm sober.

My ex-boyfriend is a heavy stoner and tbh I started smoking a lot more when I met him. We met in lockdown, tbh I already had an unhealthy relationship with weed at that point but I didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge it. Our relationship soon became based on weed as we had nothing to do in lockdown but watch tv and smoke. 

He started to give me free weed but at first I‚Äôd pay him but I soon stopped paying for it. Since I was getting free weed I started smoking more by myself as well as with him because it was unlimited and money was no longer a factor impacting how much I could smoked. Btw he didn‚Äôt use it against me or for ‚Äòfavours‚Äô but gave m it because he didn‚Äôt want to make money off me.

At first I got these hallucinations when I wasn‚Äôt sober (drunk or stoned) I didn‚Äôt worry or tell anyone about it (before I met him). But it soon start to be consistently in my sober life as well and still is (not sure when it started exactly).

This is why I had to break up with my boyfriend because I couldn‚Äôt date someone who was such a heavy user. I‚Äôm just not strong enough to resist it right now. He wanted to try and stay to together and he asked what he could do but it‚Äôs not just a matter of hiding weed from me and not giving me any. He would have to stop to and I can‚Äôt ask that and I know he wouldn‚Äôt of (said so after breakup).

I didn‚Äôt want to ruin our relationship by stealing weed from him and saying don‚Äôt give me weed but then on a bad day I might be horrible to him cause he won‚Äôt give me any but I‚Äôm just craving it.

I didn‚Äôt wanna ruin our memories and I needed to stop now due to the hallucinations so I had to break up with him. I do know that weed can cause psychosis (especially at my age). 

It was a sudden break up because I did it in a moment of clarity and needed to do it while I was still thinking straight/had the momentum. I told him about the hallucinations (first person I told that it happens when I‚Äôm sober) so he understood how serious this was. 

It was hard but he understood I had to for my mental health. My sister as since taken my weed stuff away from me (I asked) and showed me this Reddit. Now I have an exam tomorrow but I‚Äôm going through a break up and going cold turkey so I think I need to tell my school?

Side note: my school are deciding my grades (based on assessments + other work) so tbh I don‚Äôt wanna say ‚Äòhey I‚Äôm a drug addict‚Äô because of that but I think it‚Äôs for the best if they know?

Should I have said no to coming? Probably. 

But, at the same time, I said no to smoking any joint or blunts, and believe me there were a lot, and still stuck to my quit.

I didn‚Äôt fail because I still did what I originally set out to do, which is, to not smoke. And if anything, this has strengthened my mindset because now I‚Äôve turned down the mother of all stoner holidays: 4/20.

To all the people quitting who may get a second hand high from their friends, it‚Äôs okay! If you‚Äôve set out to quit and haven‚Äôt even put a joint or bong to your lips, then you‚Äôre still succeeding!

Im on my third day sober after about 8 years of daily smoking without almost any stops.

I am just a bit concerned, as I've read all these posts here about people noticing a huge difference just a day or two after quitting, feeling sooo much more motivated and all, but Im not feeling any of that. The only difference I notice is im not waking up feeling like dogshit. I used to always smoke various joints before bed, and would wake up feeling like I had been hit by a truck. My waking is now a bit clearer. Also, I find im a bit more social, but still find it a bit hard.

However, I dont really notice anything else. I feel im still wasting so much time, and im struggling to find motivation. Like its a beautiful day here in Spain today and im here stuck at home doing nothing. My head also still feels quite cloudy, I feel I can't take many sharp decisions yet.

To be honest part of me just wants to roll up a fat one and forget about all this, but im 25 and have wasted too much time already. I must push on. I am hoping to see some results in the next few days but who knows.

I fear I may have caused irreversible damage to myself through years of smoking large amounts.

If anyone has some experience or advice it will be much appreciated. Good luck to all with your own journey

Reached my 30 days without smoking milestone yesterday and wanted to share my experience thus far on my journey. A little background - I'm a 30 year old man and had been smoking on a regular basis since I was 16, my use gradually ramping up through college until age 27 when I hit a low point of depression and needed to reset. I quit for over a year, and during that time achieved the most personal growth and development I‚Äôd ever experienced ‚Äì lost a bunch of weight, ran my first 5k, traveled alone, took up new hobbies, and otherwise engaged with life on a level I never knew was possible.

This period of my life culminated in reconnecting with a girl I had a huge crush on in college, leading to a romantic relationship & moving in together. She is a smoker and, believing myself over the negatives of using, I soon started smoking again myself. Life was good. I was content renting a little house in the suburbs, a couple of cats and the laid back atmosphere of ‚Äúchilling‚Äù all the time with my best friend and lover. I looked toward the future with bright eyes ‚Äì marriage, home ownership, and ultimately a family of my own to raise & support.

Then my father passed away a few years ago and I reached a point where I was excessively self-medicating (a gram or more a day) every day. In that time, I went from my high point of personal growth to a full-blown 180 of mental, physical and emotional regression. Couple that with the trials & tribulations of a COVID world and the inflammatory rhetoric of a historically terrible political cycle, after years of this gradual decline and my repeated refusal to actively accept her advice and support, she no longer wished to continue the relationship this past February.

On St. Patrick‚Äôs Day 2021, my ex and I had an opportunity after weeks of cold shoulders and harsh tones to have a genuine heart to heart talk about ‚Äúus‚Äù. We smoked a little bit and as one statement led to another, she said the words that have become the catalyst for my actions ever since ‚Äì She could never trust me to be the father of her child someday.

*That broke me*. I betrayed the image of the man she thought I was for the shell of the man I had become ‚Äì unreliable, dishonest, over-reactionary, aloof, professionally stagnant, and otherwise uncaring to her feelings as I became self-absorbed with my own petty beliefs & desires. Weed didn‚Äôt ruin the relationship ‚Äì ***I did.*** I allowed the important things in my life to fall secondary to impulsive satisfaction and empty catharsis, prioritizing everything that didn‚Äôt bring me true happiness & fulfillment. I gave up on the ""best"" me.

So I moved out, paying my remaining two months on our lease together, and have been since sleeping on my friends couch as I, once again, hit the reset button on my life. It‚Äôs more obvious to me than ever that if I truly am my own worst enemy, than it‚Äôs simply not possible to be the ‚Äúbest‚Äù me and smoke weed - I‚Äôm just not capable of having those two things co-exist.

I haven‚Äôt smoked since that evening with my ex. No urges, no cravings, but in their place I have an overwhelming sense of shame for letting things come to this. Over the past 30 days I‚Äôve learned:

* Excessive smoking completely distorted my perspective lens. I was locked in a state of negative rumination, only seeing the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and never seeing the ‚Äúright‚Äù in the world around me. Any attempts to exercise mindfulness are void when handicapping my own mind‚Äôs ability to process negative thoughts and emotions.

* Stoner me is a coward. Too afraid to take action. Too afraid to take accountability. Too afraid to work toward a fulfilling life. Always giving in to the ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Wannas‚Äù.

* It made all of my underlying behavioral issues worse. Anything that existed before smoking just got buried in the haze of being high all the time and it was impossible to bring myself to see them for the issues they are and actively work through them.

* Smoking all the time makes habit building almost impossible. There‚Äôs no room for new routines when every cue is rewarded with getting high.

* It hinders intellectual pursuits. I used to be an avid reader, but hadn‚Äôt so much as opened a book in these past few years.

* Occasional weed use may help spark creativity, but regular use doesn‚Äôt nurture it. I completely lost my urge to create, which in turn stymied my professional development as a graphic designer

* Weed absolutely destroyed my libido. The more I smoked the less I wanted to have sex, which only comes off as ‚Äúnot being attracted‚Äù to your significant other despite what my true feelings say contrary. Embarrassing, emasculating, but fuck it‚Äôs the truth.

* I‚Äôm still an advocate for weed an its myriad of benefits. Living in NY, I‚Äôm thrilled to see legalization finally happening. Yet, given my personal experiences, I have no interest in being a user within weed culture ‚Äì just a vocal ally.

However, the shame I feel is motivation to do more for myself and since quitting I:

* Committed to a regular daily fitness routine of basic running & core exercises, losing almost 20 lbs so far and reaching the lowest weight of my adult life.

* Hike on a weekly basis, enjoying the world‚Äôs natural beauty without the obsessive need to get high to experience significance.

* Began reading again, rekindling my love of learning. I go to the library once a week to appreciate the value of a public space for knowledge and learning. Finished 3 books with the goal of reading 20+ by the end of summer.

* Attend therapy weekly, because self-medicating didn‚Äôt make ANY of my issues better. Seeing real change the more I face it head-on & it's going a long way to ease my shame from years ignoring my ""demons"".

* Practice mental wellness exercises daily, including meditation, yoga, reading stoic philosophy and journaling (like this post!)

* Rediscovered my love of art & design, thrilled to find myself enjoying that creative flow state and seeking inspiration. I‚Äôve begun a full re-brand of my freelance business.

* Can pass a drug test and will begin a completely new career next week. One that will actually facilitate my life goals and provide me fulfillment every day through hard work.

* Willingly engage in conversation with strangers, the social anxiety and misanthropy I was once feeling giving way to my inherent love for connecting with other human beings.

* Play an active and supportive role in the lives of my family members who are also still grieving the loss of my father, where once I was content to avoid that heartache by ignorantly ""living my own life"". Today is his birthday and we're all going to spend it together as a family celebrating his memory with a cook-out.

* Appreciate me! It‚Äôs nice to have my own company to rely on again without the voice of doubt and self-loathing that weed makes too loud to hear otherwise.

Thank you all for the amazing support and encouragement shown on this subreddit day in and day out. I hope that my story can help anyone else struggling with these issues. It gets better, and it‚Äôs far from easy, but nothing in life that's worth it is. I'm worth it! *You‚Äôre worth it!*

I smoked like a chimney, morning, lunch, bedtime, anytime, any day. I would leave places early or not want to go just because I wanted to take a hit. 

I‚Äôm 30F years old and I‚Äôm one week into quitting. I had a couple of cravings but that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt have any weed so I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to act on it anyways. Almost thought about scraping but that shit taste so bad. 

The first few days I couldn‚Äôt get to sleep until midnight or later and usually I‚Äôm out by 8:30pm. 

Day 6, I finally fell asleep early and had a wonderful night sleep with very vivid dreams. I‚Äôve had a banging headache for the whole week which could have multiple reasonings. 

My appetite is weird. I am hungry but don‚Äôt crave anything. When I eat I get a little nauseous. 

I also figured out I had depression three days after I quit. So I‚Äôm taking some meds and I am a completely different person. Weed was helping me cover what was actually wrong with me. I was hiding behind it and then blaming it for how I was. (Tired, lazy, unhappy, ect) 

So far I feel good. My anxiety has lowered a little. I think this is a new beginning for me. Now that I was able to fix the core root of my problems (depression) I feel excited for the future. 

I have an addictive personality, so I need to find something healthy and productive to obsess about now.

It‚Äôs made me a bitter, resentful, obsessive person who never really gets in touch with any feelings that I need to feel. It‚Äôs made me completely neurotic, and I have 0 focus on anything. I just constantly live in my head. My fianc√© of 4 years left me 2 months ago. Since that point I have been so disgustingly obsessed with her and what she‚Äôs doing. Constant thoughts of who she‚Äôs with, is she getting with other people, all that shit. I hit rock bottom yesterday when I saw her. She looked great, she‚Äôs been losing weight, and just an absolute bomb shell. She‚Äôs gonna make someone so happy, and it‚Äôs completely destroying me.

Today is a new start. A chance to really give myself the opportunity to learn, grow, and become the man in supposed to be. I can no longer allow myself to be in the pit of sadness and depression. It‚Äôs time to stand up for myself in the face of tragedy, and malevolence. I‚Äôve been hurt, used, and thrown to the side like trash. By people, and by weed.

This is because I‚Äôve started to have mild hallucinations, frequently when I‚Äôm sober.

My ex-boyfriend is a heavy stoner and tbh I started smoking a lot more when I met him. We met in lockdown, tbh I already had an unhealthy relationship (smoking when anxious due school work then, then not doing anything cause I used to stoned)with weed at that point but I didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge it. Our relationship soon became based on weed as we had nothing to do in lockdown but watch tv and smoke. 

He started to give me free weed but at first I‚Äôd pay him but I soon stopped paying for it. Since I was getting free weed I started smoking more by myself as well as with him because it was unlimited and money was no longer a factor impacting how much I could smoked. Btw he didn‚Äôt use it against me or for ‚Äòfavours‚Äô but gave m it because he didn‚Äôt want to make money off me.

At first I got these hallucinations when I wasn‚Äôt sober (drunk or stoned) and I thought it was just some other drug (can‚Äôt say due to rules) flashbacks, so I didn‚Äôt worry or tell anyone about it (before I met him). But it soon start to be consistently in my sober life as well and still is (not sure when it started exactly). I used to use some other drug some what heavily but I haven‚Äôt had any for at least 3-4 months. 

This is why I had to break up with my boyfriend because I couldn‚Äôt date someone who was such a heavy user. I‚Äôm just not strong enough to resist it right now. He wanted to try and stay to together and asked what he could do but it‚Äôs not just a matter of hiding weed from me and not giving me any. He would have to stop to and I can‚Äôt ask that and I know he wouldn‚Äôt of (said so after breakup).

I didn‚Äôt want to ruin our relationship by stealing weed from him and saying don‚Äôt give me weed but then on a bad day be horrible to him cause he won‚Äôt give me any (for my own good).

I didn‚Äôt wanna ruin our memories and I needed to stop now due to the hallucinations so I had to break up with him. I know it may mainly be the so other drug use that caused the hallucinations but I do know that weed can cause psychosis (especially at my age). 

It was a sudden break up because I did it in a moment of clarity and needed to do it while I was still thinking straight/had the momentum. I told him about the hallucinations (first person I told that it happens when I‚Äôm sober) so he understood how serious this was. 

It was hard but he understood I had to for my mental health. My sister as since taken my weed stuff away from me (I asked) and showed me this Reddit. Now I have an exam tomorrow but I‚Äôm going through a break up and going cold turkey so I think I need to tell my school?

Side note: my school are deciding my grades (based on assessments + other work) so tbh I don‚Äôt wanna say ‚Äòhey I‚Äôm a drug addict‚Äô because of that but I think it‚Äôs for the best if they know?

I was a daily smoker since the start of the pandemic, but I started smoking early on. It would be on and off and in moderation, so it was not that bad, but the pandemic really made me lose control. Every day, I would go through my day and then end it with a smoking session. Being at home really destroyed my mental state and it just made it very easy to smoke because everything was done online. Sometimes I would smoke twice a day, one in the afternoon and one at night. This really warped my sense of reality and I was very comfortable with where I was in life even though I should not be at all since I have my whole life ahead of me still. It made me lazy and content with my life because if I could get high, it would be okay. I would get high to cope with all my problems, which is like running away. This is really bad, and I didn't notice until I had a really bad high a couple of days ago where I would feel my heart rate go up and feel some sort of anxiety attack happening. I have had bad highs before and this type of bad high is scary. This is when I knew I needed to stop. Getting high wasn't enjoyable anymore and I was in pain. Am I overreacting? Possibly, but I knew I needed to change something. 

I got my first dose of the covid vaccine a week ago and I got the side effects such as nausea, joint pains, chills, dizziness, headaches, exhaustion, tiredness, feeling weak, and loss of appetite. These side effects eventually went away after 3-4 days, but then I started to still feel like I lost my appetite, heart rate increase, chest aches, cold sweats, stuffed nose, headaches, and feeling weak. I also found myself getting irritated very easily and would get mad at people for no reason. I'm 22 years old so I kind of shrugged off the symptoms as part of the vaccine giving me a good immune response since I‚Äôm pretty young, but then I realized I hadn‚Äôt smoked in about 2-3 days at this point. I then started to think that having withdrawals from weed must be crazy. I didn‚Äôt have this problem before, but that was because I was not abusing it. I‚Äôm sitting here typing this and I really want these withdrawal symptoms to go away. I just want to feel normal again. This is painful and I don‚Äôt want to go through this ever again. When did smoking weed stop becoming fun? Probably when I decided to use it to cope with my problems instead of dealing with it. If I was sad, I would get high and that would make me happy. If I was mad, I would get high. If I was happy, I would get high. This is a clear sign of addiction. I was so addicted to being high that when I did get high, I found myself just staring into nothing and thinking about nothing. Getting lost in the high. I knew this was a problem and maybe I can one day go back to smoking for fun and not as a way to cope with my problems. I brought this upon myself and I only blame myself. 

I just wanted to write this post to get it off my chest and I hope it really does get better‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to feel like this ever again and the withdrawals symptoms are something I never wish upon someone. It is the worst thing that can ruin someone and it is really bad when someone tells you to ‚Äújust quit.‚Äù They don‚Äôt understand because they don‚Äôt deal with it.  I know this post is long, but I‚Äôm just sharing my experience and hopefully being sober again will be fun again along with not frying my brain. I'm going to try to stay off of it for as long as possible. If I relapse and smoke again, as long as it won't be me smoking everyday. A lot better than smoking everyday.

i'm able to push towards any goals i've set for myself more easily without feeling like i need to be high to do everything which usually ends with me being on the couch for hours in an obsessive spiral. it's not easy and to be honest i'm afraid when i go back to uni on friday it'll be much harder to resist, but i'm seeing so many benefits that's i know it's worth it to stay sober; i have myself back and i'm getting to know myself more everyday, overall just improving as a person

Withdrawals have been brutal, and I'm still dealing with PAWS-like symptoms almost six months later. It seems like I'm always up and down, and while I've gotten my shit together in some senses, I'm not making much progress in life overall. I feel like I'm white-knuckling it most days, even now - I try to deal with the anxiety and low mood as best as I can for a couple months, stay completely sober, then relapse. 

I've relapsed every couple of months since November - usually just a day or two of being high here and there. I've mostly been able to stop the relapses from going on too long because the highs are never pleasant, I just get really anxious but keep smoking because at least I'm getting high. I think I keep relapsing because so many of my problems seem insurmountable - I feel like I've fucked up my entire life completely, and that I won't get a proper re-do with my constant mental and physical health issues. So I try to keep progressing in my nonexistent career and personal life, get overwhelmed with stress and insomnia, then relapse. 

I've held onto my stash since I ""quit,"" and have given it to someone to hold onto for me. I don't really know why I'm holding onto it, other than it's stuff I was stockpiling - it's over $1k worth. Every relapse has involved me going over to grab something ""to help me sleep"" or whatever other bullshit excuse I had at the moment. This weekend I was too embarrassed to admit to relapsing and just ended up have a cart delivered to my house, which I threw out after a couple days of using and feeling like garbage.

Today's cancellation was a surprise but I was contemplating stopping and grabbing a 2 pack of joints and in my mind slowly justifying that I could smoke maybe one while I'm playing today and wait until the next time I play to smoke the other one. Of course I have given in to the temptation in the past and it was not successful and lead me back down my road of smoking regularly
In addition a ball golf round on Monday with another friend of mine who smokes is also not happening this week. Instead I am playing ball golf tomorrow with a friend who is 10 years into recovery and one who never touches the substance.

&#x200B;

It's Day 14 here for me and its been a roller-coaster of emotions - a lot of ups and downs. Here's a few things I've observed about my behavior and moods:

&#x200B;

1. There's times where I feel like I can do everything and then there's days where I feel like doing nothing but sleeping.


2. I have been sleeping a lot randomly. I'm still able to sleep on time and wake up a few minutes before my alarm rings in the morning (which I wouldn't be able to do when I was smoking).


3. I'm also taking naps after work for an hour or two and between meals


4. Noticed I'm gaining weight and my body being plumper than usual (for lack of better words)


5. Headaches are fewer in frequency but general anxiety is still there when facing problems. I understand the weed was silencing the anxiety and that I need to tackle issues head-on without resorting to being high. 


6. The general anxiety might just be the withdrawal symptoms. I've noticed that I start living inside my heads several times a day thinking back about my smoking days.


7. The anxiety might also be the general existential-type angst. I need to find other hobbies that make me happy and give my life meaning. 


8. I have been constantly fantasizing about smoking, vaping, consuming edibles again. I keep thinking about that really good sativa concentrate that I purchased last time that is just waiting to be vaped... or even that full-spectrum oil that needs to be put inside a sandwich and eaten. 


9. I keep planning to stay off of weed for the next 100 days but every now and then think to myself why wait till 100...why not start again this weekend or next weekend, reset to zero and start fresh again.... but then I think about how I'd waste the progress I've made so far....


10. I think these withdrawal effects might be due to the concentrates I started using in recent months. Prior to this year, I was strictly flowers and edibles. Either way... I need to get away from these withdrawal symptoms. I'm counting my blessings that its just THC and not something heavy or scarier.

I can deal with the other stuff, but I am becoming scared to even try to get to sleep. I honestly think I can give up weed, if it weren't for these nightmares. Maybe it's because I know at someone point in the future these nightmares will turn into a reality. I don't know. I'm just crushed, as I feel like I'm experiencing her passing every night. I love her so much, and I'm so scared. I understand vivid/crazy/nightmarish dreams are common, but, how long do they last? If something breaks my ongoing sobriety it will be this.

 I hope it will help me in my journey towards letting go of my addiction.

The pandemic and lockdown has taken my weed relationship to a level I am starting to get concerned about where I cannot stop smoking from 9am to whenever I finally fall asleep. 

The big factor has been my company going full "" working from home"" since the begining of the pandemic. Which gives me the opportunity to get high all day without anyone noticing. Something which would have been impossible 12months ago.

At work my addiction serves me in getting really focused on the tasks at hand, and provides me with an artificial sense of calmness I have convinced myself I need.

Yet it is at home, in my family life; that my addiction shames me the most. 
I am a Mom to a 1 year old.
 I stopped smoking all through pregnancy. 3 weeks after my son was born I smoked a joint trying to - numb the pain of my c-section, the pain from breastfeeding, the stress from not sleeping. From there I went 6months only smoking at night; once my son was asleep and I had pumped. 
As soon as I returned to work in Oct.2020 and stopped breastfeeding, I had no ""reason"" to not smoke as much as I wanted as I was not harming anyone other than myself.

 Last years 8pm relax joint has evolved into a monster that tells me that smoking at 9am before I read my mails is the only way I will get through the day.

I have watched myself turn into this. 
And for the last 12 months I have been telling myself that the world will reopen soon and then I will have to go to the office where I cannot get high and my addiction will solve itself, somehow...

I also see my baby, growing up, walking and watching me from the other side of the window balcony, lighting up. 
And I feel shame. 

So here I am, spilling my feelings on the internet.

I am out of weed, and am fighting the urge the scratch what I can out of my grinder so I can light up ""one last time""

I hope writing this will motivate me to finally start day 1 of not smoking.

I wanted to share my story. I started smoking regularly 5 years ago when my father had passed and I'd been on the edge of alcoholism - trying to numb the pain and trying to be strong for my mother, all while ignoring my own grief. Shortly after I needed to be admitted to a psych ward, after hitting a mental wall and standing on a bridge above a dark Danube and looking forward to embrace the black cold of the river.

Weed turned out to be a great alternative to alcohol, it had all the great effects (mainly for falling asleep and turning off my thoughts), and seemed to be the holy grail for me.

Until I realized it was stealing my strength, motivation and the will to move my life forward. And that was just recently. I got used to such amounts that I got into debt, I was lonely, and was just wasting time, while thinking that everything was great and weed helped me to cope. Weed was great, but recently I realized how wrong I was. I got more secluded and lonely, felt weak and not in control of my faculties. 

Two weeks ago I decided to stop it all, after a mental breakdown over a tiny disagreement with a friend. My suspicions had been growing over a couple of months that what I had been doing was just escapism and weakness. I observed my friends grow, build families, while I stayed a bachelor Peter Pan stoning away at every opportunity.

I'm 37 now. I decided that enough is enough, that the numbing was just destroying my life. I've been sober for two weeks now. I'm slowly starting to feel alive again, although empty at times, but I'm convinced that leaving was the best decision I could make. People started commenting that I seem livelier, sharper of mind than usual, and for the first time in a long time I feel like I can fulfill my dream of founding a family, although it's been harsh. I'm realizing that true happiness comes from good deeds, not good weeds.

Even though it was a small post, I got some awesomely helpful feedback from this community, so I wanted to give an update.

Things are MUCH better!!! I took almost all of the advice I got in terms of behavioral mods for my cat, and what worked the best was completely ignoring her meowing and keeping her awake during the day using a laser pointer. We also go on leashed walks now. She still sometimes does her 3am opera, but I have an extra fan in my room to take the edge off.

When I was in that low place right after quitting, the withdrawal was BAD, and I didn‚Äôt realize how all the psych issues I‚Äôd been using weed to self-medicate for were coming into play. When she‚Äôd wake me up at night, I‚Äôd be fully awake, and I‚Äôd be blindly furious because I was already not sleeping well or feeling good. As a result, my already shitty work quality was in constant decline and I was scared I‚Äôd lose my job.

Turns out I have ADHD and the weed was ‚Äúmasking‚Äù it all these years! When she‚Äôd wake me up at night my mind would just start going. It's like having a room full of TVs all on full volume while changing channels every minute. The weed used to dull all the noise. I‚Äôm on prescription meds for it now and my entire life has changed. The noise is actually gone! Is this how people without ADHD function all the time? Holy crap. Seriously, I feel like a new person. I‚Äôm so happy about it I could cry. 

I even came clean to my boss about what‚Äôs been going on and why my work has been so bad for so long and was getting worse (she‚Äôs an amazing person who works in DEI). She was so happy for me and so supportive that I actually did start crying during the meeting. She checks up on me weekly now and keeps encouraging me to continue to take care of myself. I don't have the hazy demotivation from the weed nor the ""noise"" of adhd anymore, so I'm killing it at work. It's amazing!

My cat and I are best friends again. She got me through some of the worst, sleepless nights of the withdrawal. I would wake up shaking and miserable and go to the sofa and she‚Äôd cuddle me til I fell back asleep. I‚Äôm SO glad for the responses I got to my initial post and for this whole online community in general. 

I know it isn't all smooth sailing from here on out. I'm gonna hit rough patches and I'm going to want to go back to my old, ""trusty"" method of losing myself in a cloud of smoke. I still have that ""emergency joint"" squirreled away that I can't bring myself to toss yet, but I have no desire to smoke it. Now that I know I can live without it, I want to continue to do so. I'm even starting to like who I am (didn't think that was possible while sober!).

Im just endlessly grateful‚ù§Ô∏è- for myself finally quitting weed, for my psych who helped me through the withdrawal and recognized my adhd, for my boss being her amazing empathetic self, for all of you in this community who have helped me feel less alone through it all and encouraged me to work on my relationship with my cat instead of giving her back to the shelter, and also for my cat, the little f**ker. I love her to pieces.

I should be celebrating 10 months sober from marijuana, but I‚Äôm having some intense survivors guilt because about a week ago I found out that one of my old friends/former dealers had passed away from a drug overdose. I hadn‚Äôt seen him in person in years, but he had reached out to me on Facebook around my 9 months sober and we were talking about my sobriety. He was congratulating me about my clean time and telling me how he had been working on getting clean, and I was telling him that if he puts his mind to it, he can do anything. That all is possible.

He was such a nice guy. We worked at a restaurant together, and he was always so positive. He used to sell me marijuana every now and then, and I also occasionally bought ecstasy off of him. He was smart, he was hardworking, he was funny. He was better than his addiction. It hit me really hard to see that he had passed away. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I still can‚Äôt.

I can‚Äôt help feeling that I could have done something more to help. I know that someone that I haven‚Äôt seen in person in years is not my responsibility, but we were talking about his struggles with his sobriety and I let the conversation fall off. I can‚Äôt help feeling that if I would have talked to him more about it, maybe he wouldn‚Äôt have overdosed. Maybe I could have convinced him to get some help, to enter a treatment program, something. Anything.

I‚Äôve been in denial, and that was almost 8 months ago. I didn‚Äôt think it was that bad and thought she was blowing things out of proportion. So I tapered down my use and got sober.

That lasted three months. Then I had a stressful day and remembered some products I didn‚Äôt throw away (I had been so strong to say no!). Smoked some, then went without again for almost six weeks. Not sure what happened now but I relapsed. Spent another month or so smoking every day. Got clean AGAIN. For a month.

Now I‚Äôm facing a very stressful period of time along with extreme emotional distress and here I am again. Been smoking every day for the past four days. Bought more stuff.

Now I know I have a problem. I‚Äôm not smoking for fun. I tell others, like my husband, that it‚Äôs to lift my mood and motivate me to clean and stuff, but I won‚Äôt say what it really is. I‚Äôm punishing myself. I have had an eating disorder that pops up from time to time (also a form of self harm) which has reared its ugly head recently, and I guess because I have been trying not to go down that route I‚Äôm instead abusing weed. 

I will smoke more than planned, keep going until I‚Äôm numb. And know full well what I‚Äôm doing to myself. And just dig that figurative knife in deeper. Then I tell my kids I‚Äôm not feeling well and just go to bed and watch concerts on YouTube.

It‚Äôs not who I want to be, but I can‚Äôt seem to climb out of this hole by myself. The emotions and fear of my own thoughts is too scary.

The reason I have the confidence to do it this time is I know I can't make the same mistake and give into the thought of ""just one won't hurt"". These last two days of being sober have already been better than what any substance has done. I feel like I'm able to talk to people, remember important things, I feel more motivated and free. I know I'm still early on in this uphill battle but I'm keeping my head up. Going back to work has really helped too. It give me something to be proud about. A sense of worth to a degree and that's why I chose to make the change again. I don't want to risk losing the one thing giving me a sense of worth right now.

I told him that I recently quit, and have just been trying to deal with things head on instead, and although it's been a short period its helped me a lot.

It honestly feels surreal to be typing that...

I started smoking weed when I was 13 and smoked every single day until I was 28.

I never thought I would quit smoking, always thought I was one of these people who could manage my life while being stoned all the time. I would imagine myself years down the line still smoking weed. I also refused to admit to myself how out of hand my addiction had become and how it was negatively impacting my life and those around me.

Since I have stopped the benefits have been amazing. I am way less lazy, my memory has improved massively, I no longer have massive mood swings and in general I just feel a lot more positive about my life.

Relationships with my family and friends have also improved dramatically. I am able to connect with people and share my feelings etc rather than keep things bottled up in a haze.

I started a new job a few weeks ago and honestly if I was still smoking every day I don't think I would have had the confidence and more importantly the drive to get back into a job like that.

It's also little things like being bothered to brush my teeth every night or not having my bedroom stink of smoke etc that make a big difference!

I genuinely wish that I had quit years ago, I could have sorted my life out much sooner and also might have been able to save the most important relationship in my life, but sadly I was too late. I just have to look into the future with positivity and not dwell on the past - something that smoking weed every day prevented me from doing.

If you are reading this and feel like you might want to stop smoking weed, I would 100% recommend it. The benefits massively have outweighed the cons in my opinion. The first month or so is hard, but eventually you won't even think about it anymore and you will genuinely feel like a massive weight has been lifted.

I am well over a month now, but the number to me really means nothing. I am so happy but at the same time quite sad. 

You were right true friends would now emerge but what a shame it is to see that old friends that smoked would view me in such a different light. I will keep this short but I had two best friends my whole life, known them both since around 6years old. 

When I quit I told one of them that I was going off radar for a while to get clean. First of all that friend said ""Why are you on crack?"", and then I said I wanted to see what my life was like without weed and their response was, ""why are you telling me this?‚Äù I replied telling them it was because they were my friend. Their response so far really cut deep but the following message really killed it. They said ""Do you think I am going to push you back to weed again?"" I was surprised by this and said, ""No not at all, this is not about you but about me"" I knew I had problem and wanted my friend to know I was making a positive change and to be a good friend myself by giving them a heads up.

Needless to say the interaction left me jaded and it has been over a month like I say. Well it was their shared birthday (twins) on the 6th and I wished them a happy birthday. Except this time they never replied or even acknowledged my well wishes. I even asked how their birthday was a few days after and still was met with radio silence.

Now I have known for a while for various reasons that these two relationships are no longer good for me; one pushed me away a few years back when I was having a major life crisis and the one above has a very toxic partner that belittles me constantly. So I have known that these relationships could no longer continue as they were. Yet, even with all the positive changes I have made in the last few years (Stopping smoking daily exercise, journaling, perusing my career, open-minded views, self-care and now quitting my final vice) I felt that they were still my friends.

I guess those who commented on my recent [quit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/max69y/a_fortnight_ago_i_decided_to_take_back_my_life/) were right; I clearly not need those layabout friends anymore. They really did have no drive and ambitions. But damn it hurts to see them treat me like I do not exist after spending a quarter of a lifetime together. Both of these friends were present through practically my entire story I told you all. Yet now they are not and it in some way is a relief yet painful at the same time.

It started out as lighting up the ends of their joints, but now I'm 19 and I steal the weed, papers, and whatever I need to roll from them and so far I've gotten away with it.

The thing is, I've been telling myself I need to stop for some time now. I tried cutting back gradually, stopping suddenly, and nothing seems to work. I keep falling back down and deeper into my addiction rabbit hole and it's really hard to find something to hold on to trying to get out. At this point I'm full of doubt in my ability to quit, especially considering the fact that I still live with my parents and live in a city that smells of weed day and night.

The last year has been especially hard. After finishing school and having my heart broken I've wasted away in the comfort of doing nothing and smoking all day. I find myself stopping with nothing to replace what has become my routine and escape.

I definitely suffer from CHS due to intense morning nausea while smoking as well as random puking attacks all over the years. I also get the shivers und sweats pretty bad to the point I absolutely have to look like I‚Äôm coming off of opiates, which makes sense because I always was suuuuper sensitive to weed but used it to compensate bpd and intense insomnia which spiraled in an insane amount of consumption for me. I‚Äôve lost a scary amount of weight due to my appetite completely vanishing and only being able to eat while high, but also only in the evening due to the nausea. And now I have to go through this journey of sobriety again because I was too cocky about it and not considerate at all, not being able to eat for the next few days unless it‚Äôs toast or a smoothie. (Luckily I haven‚Äôt reached the non stop puking phases which bring people to the ER, I always puke only once or a few times over a day) 
I‚Äôve been smoking since 16/17 and now I‚Äôm 21, looking back weed ruined these years and made me cave in completely.
Stress seems to trigger CHS‚Äò responses, so every holiday I‚Äôve been on I puked aggressively and was unable to enjoy anything.
And now after all these shitty years and numerous withdrawals which make me wanna die, I decided to post here to take some accountability and to have some kind of contract with myself.

Recently i‚Äôve been going through phases like telling myself i‚Äôm dirty pot head and a drug addict and then leaving those phases. I justify my usage with telling myself that i‚Äôm paying all my bills on time, doing my school work, and having other routines etc. But sometimes i can‚Äôt help but feel like i‚Äôm being becoming stupid and don‚Äôt have any hobbies (yet i‚Äôve recently started going to the gym because i just feel unhealthy and skinny) and just do school, work, and video games. I often find myself comparing myself to one of my friends that is really into reading. it‚Äôs a dark spiral of thoughts that makes me feel shitty. I rip my pen a lot, sometimes throughout the day and always at night, every night. i‚Äôve been better about using it during the day however sometimes i just feel....bad about myself when i think about my usage but i also feel like maybe i‚Äôm being too hard on myself. I wouldn‚Äôt say i‚Äôm scared to quit but i also like smoking/vaping so it‚Äôs hard to when it‚Äôs not really affecting me negatively.

I created this list mainly for myself, but I‚Äôm posting here in case anyone else is struggling with the same things. My weed-addled brain keeps feeding me these thoughts, so I‚Äôm breaking them down and actively replacing them with alternative thoughts until the alternative thoughts can become habit.

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôll feel deprived!‚Äù**

Sure I will, if I continue to indulge a romanticized view of weed and look at it as something to be missed. The human mind is incredibly powerful, and I can often affect outcomes based on what I expect to occur (positive or negative). If I view lack of weed as a deprivation, every day will be a struggle. I need to train myself to think an alternative thought instead.

To combat this ingrained idea of leaving behind weed as a loss, I have to take the mask off and look past the weed propaganda to be honest with myself about the role weed actually played in my life. While using weed, I‚Äôve been more anxious/paranoid, less in control of my finances, less connected with my family, and stagnant in my emotional development because of avoidance. It is a pleasure to leave behind these negative outcomes, not a deprivation.

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only 21, how can you have a good decade in your twenties without smoking/partying?‚Äù**

Ah yes‚Ä¶ the fear that caused me to give up on my first attempt to quit and 6 months of sober time last summer (for an awful smoke session where I greened out and vomited after 3 bong hits, my body was literally rejecting weed and I should have listened).

Well, one cannot say that I have not tried drugs, alcohol, and partying as a way of enriching my life. And the truth is? The things I‚Äôve been most proud of during my 4 year partying career, like self-recovery from a severe eating disorder, working on a degree at a great university (graduation in 1 month!), writing a television pilot etc. have happened in spite of my partying not because of it. In fact the smoking/partying only hindered my progress with these things.

I am unable to look back on the nights and mornings of endlessly hitting the vape pen to ease my comedowns from other drugs as a good thing. The truth is they were repetitive as all hell and I can‚Äôt even remember 75% of them. Smoking (and drinking and other drugs) made me partially forget some of these precious youthful years of my life. I‚Äôm not gonna waste any more of them. I would be disappointed in myself if the day I turned thirty I looked back to see a decade lost in a cloud of purple haze. So I‚Äôm quitting now so I can spend the remaining 8 years and change of my twenties doing the stuff that actually fulfills me, acting and writing.

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never going to hear a song high again! How can you abandon that special power weed gives you to hear different instruments when you listen to a song?‚Äù**

This is a toughie. The truth is that it is pretty fucking awesome to listen to music while stoned, and anyone who says otherwise doesn‚Äôt understand the power of this substance firsthand. But I need to remind myself that it is *artificially* awesome. And that every time I force my brain to artificially alter my experience of music, it diminishes my appreciation for music while sober.

I also need to remember the trade offs I was making to be able to hear the instruments differently. I was making myself more anxious, emptying my wallet, and teaching myself to settle for a hazy unrequited love rather than chasing the relationship I deserve. Pretty lopsided trade off don‚Äôt you think? Furthermore, by the time the next morning rolls around I don‚Äôt remember the way the song sounded while high anyway because weed makes your memory shit. So yeah it just isn‚Äôt worth it.

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really not going to take advantage of the fact that weed was just legalized in NYC?‚Äù**

No I‚Äôm not actually, because no matter what the government decides the status of weed is in a given area, it is still the same substance that has been negatively affecting my life for the reasons described above. Simple as that. (Side Note: even though I struggle with this thought, I am absolutely pro-legalization)

**‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt smoke weed you won‚Äôt be able to be truly close to all those cool stoners you know/just met‚Äù**

The truth is the fact that I‚Äôm quitting and deciding not to have a deprivation mindset about it has the potential to make some people uncomfortable because it forces them to reflect on the role weed is playing in their own life. That said, the real ones, the people worth knowing, the people for whom smoking isn‚Äôt the main facet of their identity or our friendship, will remain. And those who fall away were just smoking buddies anyway (which I don‚Äôt need anymore because I am no longer a smoker).

Its officially been one whole week since I willfully quit smoking pot. Every other break has been because I was too broke or couldn't find a hook up. 

I quit because I got a job in an office and need to pass a test, but also because I know I need all the brain power I can get to learn this new stuff. And maybe its just time.

 I've been a line cook for 5 years so smoking was always part of decompressing from a long day. This has been the longest week of my life. I feel like Im perpetually stuck in a waiting room; waiting to feel good, to relax, to fall asleep. Waiting for the nice warm blanket of being high to fall over me. Ive been struggling to eat, to sleep, to be nice to people. Ive been sweaty af, shaky, dizzy, and feel like I can always puke a little. 

But there is something else that's becoming more apparent with each passing day, something that trumps all of this. 

I finally have some fucking control. 

I used to spend hours a day looking at uber eats or door dash; filling a cart with waaaay too much food, feeling guilty, deleting it all, getting high and doing it over and over until eventually convincing my self I DESERVE the food. 

I used to ""not have time"" for laundry or working out or reading a book. Looking back I realized I had all the time in the world, weed just took all my desire to do anything away. 

Now I wake up and I WANT to work out. I WANT to do things again. I can look at the ice cream in the freezer and save it for later instead of scarfing it all down as fast as I can like some territorial animal. 

And I almost forgot what it was like to have real dreams. Its like going to the movies when I fall asleep. 

I still think about it constantly, and Id be lying if I said I didn't want it.

I would find reasons to smoke all day, and would try to hide it from my husband.

Finally I realized I was spending my savings on buying vape pens, when I didn't even really feel high anymore. I thought it was because the stuff I was buying wasn't ""potent"" enough, so I was constantly on a search to find ""better"" weed and cartridges. My husband began to resent my being high all the time, despite me promising I'd cut back over and over again.

Finally I decided to quit cold turkey. The first few days were absolutely awful. I felt major dysphoria, was crazy irritable and unhappy for days. I even thought about starting smoking again just to feel relief from the negative withdrawal symptoms.

But once I got over that hump, things changed. My first few weeks without smoking seemed to fly by. I lost weight from not binge eating every night, was exercising and loving all the free time I had to do whatever I wanted without constantly thinking about when I was going to get high next. I thought ""Wow, I didn't think quitting would be this easy!""

But two weeks ago I slipped into a pretty deep depression, and realized my cravings were suddenly coming back stronger than ever. I was on the edge of just giving in and saying ""Well, that was a fun experiment. I'll start smoking again."" I'm glad I brought it up with my therapist because she urged me to talk to my doctor. After speaking with him, he agreed my depression was much worse, and we decided to adjust my depression medication. My therapist urged me to keep staying clean.

So here I am... 64 days and no weed, so why are my cravings coming back now? I'm starting to feel better in terms of my depression, but still look back fondly at pot as something ""I'll eventually do again."" But I know if I had it in my bedside drawer, I'd just find a reason to go back to smoking every night again. Even though I wish I could just do it occasionally.

The best method I've found is just to try to make it to the end of one day without smoking. And if I can keep motivating myself to do just that, one day will turn into 64 more.

Mt girlfriend is so supportive It's amazing. She used to smoke with me from time to time. Doesn't have an issue with it, and only smokes once every few months, although she joined me in sobriety when I told her I had a problem and had tried to quit several times unsuccessfully. I've been honest with her today too and told her exactly how I felt. She reminded me that I made a commitment to myself and that I need to keep it.

I've been at this long enough that I only smoked flower -- it's all we had.  Then, well after I quit, shatter, dabs, vapes, and all manner of new extracts and forms came onto the scene, and they were sold at dispensaries, stores that were my dream when I was buying through shady delivery services in New York City.

The challenge for me wasn't not using them, I had developed enough coping skills to deal with that.  It was the idea that I would *never* use them.  All these new things that were tailor-made for the old me, and I was left out.  Honestly, it left me frustrated, angry, and envious, and that's always a risk.

Delta 8 may well be your new challenge.  It is just another offer by the cannabis companies -- a new process, a new price, seemingly a new high -- by most reports a poor one.  But it still gets you high and it's still a risk for us.

At Leaves we will consider Delta 8 to be just like Delta 9.  If you are having problems with your Delta 8 use and you know you need to quit you are welcome here.  It's not something to ever recommend here to help taper or something that ""doesn't count"" in sobriety.  It still gets us high and we're here to make sure we don't do that anymore.

You may be feeling the temptation that it's somehow a loophole, or the urge to try it just to see, or the envy of never knowing.  But my strong suggestion is that use the same skills you should always be using to keep yourself safe.  Forget about ""never,"" focus only on today, and just get through to bedtime without smoking Delta 8 or Delta 9 or anything that will do you harm, and in no time at all it will be just another thing that doesn't matter to you at all.",101,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6831247806549072}"

Hello everyone.

First Reddit post, long time lurker. I've been using cannabis almost every day (with the exception of certain periods of traveling) ever since I was 18. I remember that when I first began using in the years prior to that, it felt so helpful - even one night of usage would result in me feeling less anxious, angry, and depressed for multiple days after. As a child who was raised in a traumatic, broken household and who was used to constant negative emotions that was really magical. Even now, dealing with addiction/dependency, I still consider cannabis to be something which can provide a lot of emotional and spiritual benefits for me... if only I wasn't dependent.

I'm now 26, and I can't get this monkey off my back. I have felt this need, for at least the past two years, to break all dependencies, but I just feel so stuck. 

I recently switched from a vape pen to these extra-strength 20mg THC tablets in the hopes that changing route of administration would help me slowly reduce usage. Yet last night I got up to 60mg in order to help me sleep - I've increased rather than decreased use! And I'm still not sleeping well...

Ugh. I just threw away the rest of my THC tablets. I'm afraid ya'll. Its always easy to do this in the morning when I'm feeling bad - but what about when evening comes and I'm up all night? Last time I took a tolerance break I was still waking up with night sweats after 30 days.... How long will it take to heal? I'm just hoping that with my partner out of town until Sunday, and my not needing to work until next Wednesday, I might be able to deal with the initial withdrawal insomnia and then hopefully be able to begin getting a few hours a night after that. The insomnia is what gets me. If after these first 5 days I still can't get any sleep... Idk what I should do. Struggle through? I need to be able to function at work....

Lord help me fam. Any support / feedback / advice would be appreciated. Support more than anything.

Could it be the lack of weed? 
I definitely feel more easily angered by things lately. I feel like I don't have the compassion that I once did, for my SO.

I‚Äôve been smoking weed longer than that, and almost daily for the past 7 years. 

Yesterday my partner also left for a trip, who i hide a lot of my usage from. It was the ‚Äúperfect opportunity‚Äù to smoke. 

Everything about last night was great; the food, connecting with friends old and new, listening to music, and drinking (a lot of) good wine.

My friend popped out a joint, but I was already committed to not smoking and told her ahead of time. I was relaxed while they smoked, happy with my sobriety journey.

But by the time they left, there was a half consumed joint sitting there. I was buzzed from all the wine. The music playing was giving me energy and excitement. I was alone, which is when I used to enjoy smoking most. I cleaned up, keeping the joint aside. What a ‚Äúgreat reward,‚Äù i started to think.

After cleaning, I sat next to this half smoked joint and lighter. I picked it and examined the oil crystallizing around the joints butt. It smelled amazing. I sat, contemplating and replaying  many stories in my head about why I should (and maybe shouldn‚Äôt) smoke that joint. Eventually I got so tired and realized there was no point in doing anything but going to sleep.

I didn‚Äôt smoke. Waking up I feel rested and happy I chose that path. I wanted to share a few of the things that helped me last night:

‚Ä¢ My journal: always setting intentions and goals. And re-planning and re-affirming when you sense a ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù on the horizon. That morning I wrote about my partner leaving and that it was a huge risk to my sobriety. I wrote why I am doing this, and why I want to reach a new sobriety record. As I sat with the joint later, I reread this journal. (However, it did not fully convince me to discard the joint)

‚Ä¢ Knowing my triggers. This took 3 years in therapy for me to figure out. More recently I‚Äôve noticed the inverse of my known triggers also make me want to smoke! Sad or happy, bored or busy, tired and high energy. Being slightly drunk- is the alcohol making the decision or me?

‚Ä¢ Knowing my goals & replaying past stories. I recently made the commitment to work out 3 times a week. I knew that if I smoked then, i would feel tired today and would be much more inclined to smoke today and all weekend. I knew that i would get munchies and that I didn‚Äôt want to eat more that night; and it would be out of my control if I smoked. I replayed the MANY stories of previous times I gave in, and found myself unhappy of smoking daily again and having to start over. These stories and not repeating all my failed attempts are worth more than that joint.

‚Ä¢ This community - trying to read daily all of your stories, support, and achievement on here beyond encouraging. Recently I read a post that if the decision to smoke is taking so long to make and not clearly a ‚Äúyes‚Äù, then why do it? Thank you.

Don't skip this post, please take a minute to read my story. Because the same thing affecting me could affect you as you read.

I was, like a lot of us, introduced to weed by a friend when I was 17 years old. The first 1 or 2 years I have only smoked occasionally and always with friends. At that time my friends gave me their weed so that they can't smoke it until weekend and we got high together. I was that resistant. Didn't need it during week. One thing led to another and I started smoking regularly. Still had to hide it from my parents so it wasn't a massive intake. If I were to guess I'd say around 1 to 2 grams a week.
I started to struggle in school and my parents blamed my PC for it. Never said anything against it because it was better they were mad at me for playing too much PC than taking drugs on end.
At some point I moved out, said to them it would help me develop as an adult. In all reality I wanted to have them gone to smoke as much as I wanted.
And why not? While high you don't have to deal with all the outside bullshit that would otherwise effect you in one way or another.

It has gotten to the point where I would spend 600-700 euros a month from my 1300 Euro salary for weed. Bills could be paid later, never was hungry when I didn't have weed so weed always came first and food I'd take what's left with the money.

My generous dad took me in his company as a trainee and I did fine (more or less) but I started to slack off. Had multiple talks with him and he must really love with all the chances he gave me. Still than I was ungrateful and thought 'well yeah I'm your son you SHOZLD do that'

Fast forward to last week where we had a serious talk about my future in his company. I laid out my plans to study further, move out from my friends flat (who smokes a shit ton too), make drivers Ed and start taking responsibility in the company. All the while smoking like a 1800s steamship with engine problems. This Tuesday I woke up not being able to breathe, not to move and overall in massive pain.
My first thought was ""damn how did I catch the 'rona?""
Called my dad, he told me to call the ambulance. Have been transfered to a lung specialty hospital where they told me that I have Pneumothorax. Which in essence means I have air bubbles in my lungs that burst and deflate my lungs down to 10% of the original. Every hit I would now take could be a new catalyst to more air bubbles and I could end up in hospital again or worse.

It is now Friday, 5 days since i last smoked and I broke down crying in the bathroom. I am happy I am crying, I am happy that I am pissed at myself. I am happy I ended up here. I am also happy to still be able to breathe.
Over the last 9 years (I am now 26), I gave over half my purse (11‚Ç¨ an hour/2= 5,5‚Ç¨ an hour) to my dealer. In essence I went to work for him. Do you know what some people achieve in 9 years? I for one haven't even been able to replace my old smelly couch in that time. I am done wasting my life, wasting my hard earned money and wasting the little trust my parents have in me just to feel numb.
Over 3 years I have been following MMA but never did anything else than throw 1 shadow punch after each cool knockout I saw because of my laziness. 
I think it is time to start living now and start going for the stuff in life that really excites me, which is make my dad proud and MMA. 

I know this post is all over the place, I hope I made sense to some people or even inspire one or two to think about change. IF I am able to stick my mind to it, in some years time I will do a follow up post with my first amateur MMA fight and I can wait to explore the world.

But since then the cravings and withdrawals have slowed down and I find myself wanting it less and less. There are also positives like a clear head and more energy. Has been tough at times but enjoyable.

What I didn't expect is to realize why I smoked so often. I thought it was just what I do cus I've always done it. But the truth is I have been hiding from some depression and loneliness that I never addressed at least sober. When I smoked I considered myself very spiritual and aware because I meditate, do yoga etc. In reality I was coping because now I realize that the sober life I left myself sucks. No wonder my past self would want to escape. Weed made me feel like everything was ok but now here I am realizing that I have no purpose, no desires, or even things to do outside of the normal stoner stuff like eat and watch tv.

I have a long family history of alcoholism and cannabis use, although consider myself somewhat lucky in that it has never been as serious a problem for me as it has been for some close to me.

I managed to stay away from drugs and alcohol though high school, but started dabbling with them in college, never really getting sucked in, but still getting properly drunk and stoned at times.  Nothing terrible ever happened, although I did some stupid things for sure.  

When I met my wife, we both drank and smoked weed together, she was much more of a pot head than myself, however she was on a path to becoming a pharmacist, and was in the process of tapering off the weed.  As years progressed she became more and more strongly opposed to any weed use, especially since she herself could not get caught or she could lose her license.

As the years passed I went through periods of mild usage, smoking with friends, and also long periods of no usage whatsoever, going days, months and even years without smoking.  Whenever my wife caught me getting high she would get upset, and this turned out to eventually be the biggest strain in our relationship.  

I have tried to quit numerous times, more for her sake than my own, as I‚Äôve struggled to come to terms with admitting to myself that my weed use is a problem.  We both probably harbor serious resentment over this.  

One of my biggest hang ups is my aversion to alcohol use, and deep rooted belief that weed is less harmful than alcohol.  I myself feel I have made worse decisions and harmed myself far more with alcohol than weed, but my wife doesn‚Äôt see eye to eye with me about this.  

I have lost family members to alcohol, and have also had a close family member come to terms with their alcoholism and learn to give it up completely under the influence of weed.  I know that for myself alcohol is a very slippery slope, once I start drinking it becomes a daily routine with more and more consumption each day, and my wife doesn‚Äôt seem the least bit bothered by this.  

We‚Äôve had numerous talks on the matter and have made some progress, and I admit I‚Äôve struggled with weed addiction at times, especially after legalization here in my state.  I‚Äôve committed to quitting numerous times but can‚Äôt seem to find it in my heart to swear it off for good.  I still see some positive benefits in occasional use for myself, despite all the negatives that I am well aware of.  

I know this is a long winded post and I don‚Äôt really have any direct questions but am hoping some of you can relate and maybe have some advice.  Maybe this isn‚Äôt the best place to post this, but this is the community that I‚Äôve followed most closely and has helped so much in tapering my weed use and embracing my sobriety.

2021-04-16 01:01:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mrw9hx/i_almost_got_fired_last_friday/,I almost got fired last Friday...,"I've been smoking on and off for a decade now (since I was 20, 30 now), and one thing I've noticed is that when I am smoking, my motivation just fucking TANKS. To the point where even when I'm not high, I don't like writing songs on guitar, I don't like going to the gym, I don't like seeing friends.. I don't like ANYTHING.

So  fast forward to last Friday, for the first time in my professional career, I just said ""fuck it, I'm not doing it."" and my boss reamed me out...A LOT.

So from this point moving forward, I really am done. I don't even like it that much anymore. When I was younger, it made food better, TV better, music better, nature better...now it just makes it...different. All that stuff just seems...different, not better. Like I'm in a haze and shit is just different. And what's worse is that even when I'm not high, I have this inescapable fog that clouds my mind, and keeps me disoriented, unfocused, and unmotivated.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble. I'm just done now and I'm glad it's finally off my chest and out of my lungs. This week has personally, and professionally been the best I've experienced in a while.

There was a point I was very unhappy about smoking. My memory was a mess, I only hung out with people who smoked, you know the story. I kept saying I didn‚Äôt have hobbies because I‚Äôm broke (and taking lessons for anything like martial arts/dance etc is SO expensive) but in reality I could have saved up the money to buy a guitar and teach myself, which I have been saying that I‚Äôd do for over a year now.
I quit weed for about two months, most of which I spent with my family with no access to weed or a private space to smoke it. I was so sure that I‚Äôd never go back again, I was feeling so good. Sharper, more energetic, enthusiastic, felt wonderful and even had some friends tell me that I was more present and engaged with them more. All of that made me so happy!

But I went back, I said, ‚Äúokay now that I know how shit it is when you‚Äôre addicted, I won‚Äôt go there again, I wouldn‚Äôt even want to‚Äù. What happened instead, is that I enjoy it way less, but I still do it. I quit, for a week, and go back to the dispensary on friday. On sunday I‚Äôve finished that joint and feel horrible. If I have leftovers then I‚Äôll smoke it, and I won‚Äôt if I don‚Äôt because I already did this week.
Then when I‚Äôm around weed with a friend or something again, I decide that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only be a social smoker‚Äù and take a hit, have fun for the night, eat whatever is in the fridge and hate myself when I get back home. It‚Äôs easier on the days I got (relaxing/fun) things to do, but I can‚Äôt bear myself and smoke it away if I don‚Äôt...Then the next couple days drag through with extreme tiredness, and constantly debating myself in my head.
There are some occasions I seem to manage it better. I do some mindless chores like cleaning, listen to music, watch something. I haven‚Äôt been able to stick to the quitting, and I don‚Äôt know what instinct this is. I think, I‚Äôm at a point where I have to do a lot of numbing and distracting to get away from my own brain. 
But damn, do I really have to hit ‚Äúrock bottom‚Äù to learn my lesson? I sometimes feel like I just really need someone to slap me when I lie to myself, because I‚Äôm clearly so weak.
So I decided to see a therapist. I‚Äôm not actively looking for one, I‚Äôm depressed, it‚Äôs hard to do things, my doctor was going to refer me, she forgot about me and I forget to remind her. It would be nice to just forget about my existance- or forget about any drug I ever did. It would be nice if we can just put the world on hold for a few days while I sort my shit out. I‚Äôm just so sad and tired, all the time.

Nothing I‚Äôm writing is inspirational or answering anything, but, I think it‚Äôs part of the ups and downs of trying to get sober. There is a lot of clashing with yourself. There is shame and guilt, there is regret, anxiety and ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù moments in which you convince yourself that you don‚Äôt care about yourself.

then I got a job,  smoking before work and all the day after work till I fall asleep,  kept repeating again and again and again and again ,  I really know what a vicious cycle means

I thought iam the only one that is in this shitty situation

quit on last may 27.  I was losing my mind ... racing thoughts and sleepless nights.  
with no progress at all regarding my goals and dreams,  it seemed hopeless   
the question was,  to live is to suffer and iam even suffering more because of quitting weed  
but I kept going on, till jan 2021 I slipped only 4 times and then took the right path again   
since 2021 started,  I am smoking on the weekends and drinking on the working days   
as I thought that iam clean now and I can manage not to smoke on every single moment   
and iam still doing that successfully,  but...  
I found out that iam still not productive at all, iam only doing my job and craving the week end   
to get weed and smoke weed,  to be able to kill the stress and to feel whole and complete again   


why do I need weed to feel relaxed and whole ?   
by this point ,  shouldn't i be clean ?  
it's psychological and please don't tell me once an addict, forever an addict cuz I know   
but i managed to quit the addiction and break free   
and for new quitters,  I know it seems hopeless but it does get better out of no where   
no sudden changes or reliefs but somehow it happens   


for old quitters... why i don't feel clean yet ?  
I can sleep good . way better than i was using every day and i can eat normally without weed,  but,   
why do I need it to feel good , whole and relaxed ?  
why ?!!!!!  
I had issues in my life ..lots of them, delayed goals and damaged social life that i don't want to fix   
as i want to build my self and be successful to be able to build a new one,  i mean if necessary

2021-04-15 18:49:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mrq4cp/quitting_during_ramadan_my_story/,Quitting during Ramadan. My story,"I started smoking weed in 2017 after seeing it getting legalized in many states and hearing from all different media outlets and celebrities how beneficial it is and how it does not have any side effects. Initially it was once in a while thing but very quickly it became a daily habit. From the start of 2018, I have been smoking it on a daily basis. I am not going to lie. I loved the experience and it made food, music (PINK FLOYD and hip-hop), sex and everything so much better. I thought I had found the love of my life and would never quit it‚Ä¶
 
But sure enough, with time, my body started getting used to it and the high didn‚Äôt feel that great anymore. Along with that, I started noticing these problems which were hard to notice first but became very obvious recently. Initially, I tried to ignore and lived in denial but they seem to change your personality and significantly affect social, work, family aspects of your life.
 
Brain Fog ‚Äì not able to concentrate at work, think and perform well. Could not hold intelligent conversations with colleagues. My peers were getting promoted and I couldn‚Äôt even intelligently discuss or present myself in meetings. I also had the fear that I‚Äôd get fired soon which was making the whole situation worse. Lost self confidence as a result.
Memory loss ‚Äì found it hard to remember things. I would have a conversation with someone in the morning and by evening, I would totally forget about it. This was huge and I was in total denial. Impacted job performance.
Felt some health issues, got sinus infection and smoking weed made it worse. It took a long time to heal but since then my right nostril always get clogged every time i smoke weed. If I stop smoking, it get much better.
The addiction is real and I was in denial. I thought I could quit any time but was never able to.
Social issues ‚Äì losing friends, couldn‚Äôt spend proper time with kids in the last 2-3 years. They grow up so fast but I was always high and in my zone. Didn‚Äôt want to play with them to do any activity with them. Not even wanted to talk to them. I was always busy in my thoughts and most of times I would not even hear what they were saying.
Change in personality ‚Äì I felt that I made decisions in the last 3 years that I doubt would have made if I was clean. I became impulsive buyer.
 
 
I tried to quit a few times in the last 3 years but was never successful. Went outside USA for a month and felt withdrawal symptoms. I made up my mind to come back and do it in moderation. But that never happens. It quickly became a daily thing again.
 
As I started doing research, I found this community and the information I saw her, it just totally changed my mind. So many people felt the same issues and I can‚Äôt live in denial anymore. I have to quit. So with the start of Ramadan this year, I have made up my mind to quit it forever. So far it has been 4 days and the withdrawal symptoms are diminishing. I feel so much better today. I am alert, can talk in meetings, spend time with family and I am just so much more aware of things going around me and ideas that come to my mind. I also found my productivity has significantly increased in the last 2 days.
 
The withdrawal symptoms are strong. I felt dizzy, tired and sleepy all day. Also, lost my appetite. Couldn‚Äôt eat properly even during iftar after the whole day of fasting. Day 1,2 were the worst and I started feeling a little better on Day3 .
 
Now comes the challenge. I need to stay firm and stay away from it forever. Thanks to everyone for sharing your experiences on this community. It made a big difference for me and helped me take the leap. I know that it is still so early and I have a long way to go but if feel that I am determined this time to quit it for good. I found so much motivation from reading your experiences‚Ä¶ Thank you!",18,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.995305061340332}"

I still smoke weed everyday and occasionally drink more than I need to. I still feel unproductive, despite resisting the urge to go on benders. The love of my life broke up with me last night, telling me he thinks he‚Äôs enabling me and I really need time to develop my self. There‚Äôs a 3 year age difference and he‚Äôs straight edge sober, it‚Äôs always been inspiring but I never thought I had it in me to do the same. I just turned 20 years old, got a new job, a new place, and a new car. I thought I had everything in the world with him by my side but this is for the best. I‚Äôm hurting so much right now... all I can think of is substance ab*se. I will admit that I drank a lot last night, waking up hungover and confused as hell.

I am making a commitment to myself that this ends. Sobriety is so very hard, yet very rewarding. I am so familiar with weed, it‚Äôs the one thing I know so much about and know i‚Äôm ‚Äúgood at‚Äù. Such a pathetic way of looking at it but I‚Äôm starting to realize that there‚Äôs not a lot of things that would prevent me from quitting unless it was for some incredible job. I‚Äôm starting to understand that IM the incredible job. I have a lot of work I need to do and that short moment of satisfaction is tearing apart my life. I used so many excuses to say that it helps me with my ED and sleeping, calms my anxiety and makes me feel like I can breathe again. But... I know that these are all excuses. In fact, when I first started smoking, that‚Äôs when the ED kicked in, the insomnia, the depersonalization and dissatisfaction with life. The slug in me felt so comfortable avoiding responsibilities and using it as a reward system that I never stuck to. Everything is good in moderation, maybe not everything but Mary Jane most definitely. Maybe I‚Äôm cutting ties with her too... It‚Äôs so hard. 

I‚Äôm coming on here to make a promise to the beloved strangers of the universe and the internet. I am promising to myself to fulfill this goal of mine and exceed as far as my little legs can take me. I am done with this toxic cycle of nothing. I deserve a fulfilling life.

I need to articulate my thoughts and after reading a few posts on this community, a post like this seems like a great way to achieve that goal. 

For context, Im 25M currently live on my own and have done for the last 18 months, the entire time I have never spent longer than a week without getting high. I have a good, well paying job and have never smoked before work, only in the evenings and on weekends. 

Anyway, I hit rock bottom on Sunday evening... And I didn‚Äôt even realise I was near it. It was an especially quiet weekend for me, no plans and nothing happening so I made a couple of firecrackers and had one about 3pm on Saturday and another on Sunday. The first was a great time, got super high, watched a couple movies (which I instantly forgot) and went to bed. Sunday was different. It felt like I was plunged into a pool of self reflection, I seemed to lose all perspective of who I was and began to look at myself from an external point of view. What I saw was frightening, truly the worst night of my life. I realised who I actually was, and managed to break down the falsified image I‚Äôd painted of myself. What‚Äôs worse is I realised what other people probably thought of me, my family and coworkers especially. I realised I was keeping people at arms length from my life, in fear of them seeing what it was really like. I sat there crying my eyes out, thinking about my mum, thinking about how I‚Äôd let her down, and trying to work out what she really thought of me. I sat for hours just contemplating life, before going to bed feeling broken and exhausted.

I have had every single symptom of weed unproductivity during the last 2 years, without realising it was completely ruining my life. It‚Äôs been written many times on here, by people much better at expressing it than myself. So I won‚Äôt get into the specifics. What‚Äôs important is that I was able to come to that self realisation and my mindset switched, The next day I knew I had to change, I got home from work, collected all my weed & accessories in a bag (about ¬£60 worth of stuff) and held it in my hands for a good few minutes. Deciding if this was what I wanted to do. I went for it and threw it all in the outside bin. I then spent a couple of hours tidying my hellhole of a flat. What happened next was the closest thing to a ‚Äòsign‚Äô or an ‚Äòact of god‚Äô that I‚Äôve ever experienced. 

I received a completely ridiculously out of the blue phonecall from a family member needing to stay with me for the night. Usually I would have been high as fuck, 3 binbags worth of rubbish on the floor, clothes everywhere, stinking of weed, you know the score... This call would have been a nightmare come true, I don‚Äôt know what I would have done. But it wasn‚Äôt. I could host and I felt like a normal functioning human being. That night just sat sober, watching Netflix and catching up showed me that I had not only made a positive change. But that I was completely reborn. I know it sounds excessive and over the top but that‚Äôs really how I felt. Here‚Äôs a quote I read which I thought was brilliant and truly resonated with me:

‚ÄúWe have two lives, and the second begins when we realise we only have one‚Äù

Since then, my productivity has been off the charts and I know for a fact I will never touch weed again. I just had to work out, I‚Äôm 4 days sober. I‚Äôm not counting and I‚Äôm not even thinking about going back to how I was. I feel completely renewed and I love it.

I genuinely want to quit I really do more than anything but at the same time there's a part of me that doesn't want to and I think it's time I saw someone about this. This is the worst I've felt so just needed to type this I guess, just have nobody else to talk to because I do NOT want to hurt my mum moreso than I have.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9964304566383362}"

But what about the days when you've already missed your precious hours? We all know about the importance of great rest, and scientifically it's proven that lack of sleep greatly heightens our cortisol levels(stress hormones) the next day, and what does stress mutherfreaking trigger in most of us??? Relapse.
So, here are 2 things that have been saving my ass on those days (I'm on day 19~) 

1. HIIT Workouts. Look up something on youtube. Check out tabata workouts, which are 4 min sets. If you're out of shape do your best to just get in those 4 minutes! I personally try to do 12 minutes. All that matters is that you work as intensely as you're capable in a short amount of time. Get that heart rate up. High intensity training has been scientifically proven to lower and balance cortisol levels after a night of little rest. To learn more check out dr. Rhonda patrick. (Incredibly informative research scientist) 


2. (Don't hate me for this!) Bloody cold showers, for at least 60 seconds. Make sure to get your head/back of neck under.  i like to also take the shower head and pour it over specific areas of my body after submerging my head. You can try going back and forth from hot to cold, (it's an amazing high) but try to end on cold. This is easiest to do after hiit, when you're sweaty and hot front that vigorous movement. 

These practices are uncomfortable but they make a big difference. Just spending 20 minutes with your body can greatly lower and balance out those cortisol levels, so you can feel IMMEDIATELY better, and have a decent day despite your lack of rest. They'll also help you pass tf out when it's bed time that night. Ofc you won't feel perfect, but these have made a huge difference for me when one of my biggest triggers over the years has been the stress from exhaustion. 
Hope this helps!

First, i'm happy to find out about this community - it is such a relief!

**So this is how my story goes -** i've been smoking on and off (mainly on) for the past 10 years, but on a relatively small and constant amount - a joint at the end of the day. Not in the morning, but before work, not before workout, and so on (beside weekends when I sometimes smoked during the day as well). 

The main reason for me to smoke is that it **helps me sleep,** and it **helps me unwind at the end of the day.** I meditate and practice mindfulness for many years now - but nothing relaxes me like the joint.

i'm functioning well, I have a good job, a wife and a baby - and all is well. **And this is also the problem.** the problem is that I don't need the weed all day, and so, it's totally ""ok"" to use it at the end of each day. the problem is, that I hate being dependent on it. I hate thinking about needing it to sleep. I hate thinking about the fact that I'm afraid to take vacations where I can't get it. I hate thinking about the fact that i'm only creating dependency. 

But then, I also want to let go. I want not to be too hard on myself, I want to have this ""fuck it"" mentality sometimes.

In 2021 I went cold turkey for 3 months. Then the following few hard days I ""allowed"" myself to go to the club - and from there on, well, you know the story - every evening - bad habits are so hard to stop and so easy to get back to.

I'm jealous of the ones who don't care and just do it. I'm jealous at the ones who doesn't smoke or drink, and just are.

**So my question is - and I will ask it like a child - what should I do?** How can I keep justifying myself the cold turkey'ing, when it's so ""ok"" to smoke a bit at night? as I said - i'm meditating, i'm doing sports, I read all the ways to calm down naturally - **it's not that. It's the way to stick to that decision i'm looking for.**

It may be my denial speaking, but I never really felt like weed had THAT negative of impact on my personality or life- it just made me feel warmer and happier. I was a drunken emotional mess at the end of law school and through the early years of my career so I dove into weed, which I had used sporadically before, after a bad breakup and to cope with the stresses of work, family drama, my depression/anxiety,and minor stomach issues. While smoking constantly, I earned a great job and a few promotions, met and married a hot stoner chick, and have been really happy with my life. I recognize that many of these achievements are the natural outcome of growing older, wiser, and more experienced, but the weed has always been there to make the ride comfortable.

As long as you don‚Äôt deal with them sober they will always stay with you....,"I just had a crazy realization about how much weed suppresses emotions. I really fell heavily into the drug after being rejected by a girl, who was also my best friend, who I loved with everything in me. I was still a child and had no control over myself or my emotions but I smoked to numb the intense pain I felt from the situation. I spent so much time with her and had a constant reminder that I cannot be with her. Even worse, that I will watch someone else take her away. I smoked my brains out to numb the pain until I was dissociated with reality. Weed made life bearable and I thought I got over her. Fast forward two years and we no longer have any sort of relationship but every time I quit, I find that my mind gravitates towards her. The first time I was able to quit successfully was during quarantine and I thought about her quite a lot despite having no interactions with her for over a year. Six months down the line, having fell into the habit of smoking daily again and today being my 7th day of abstinence, im finding that once again I am thinking about her quite a lot. I even texted her a really long paragraph. I think this is my way of dealing with those suppressed emotions which have not disappeared even two years after the fact. 

This is a warning and a call to action to those of you contemplating quitting. All those emotions that weed is burying under its ashes are still there.

I'm going on two weeks clean after 25 years of smoking weed off an on. I'm currently in an outpatient recovery group (three days a week) go to MA anonymous meetings, I have a sponsor and have an addiction counsellor. I've relapsed a few times since deciding to quit for good at the end of 2020. I've learnt heaps about this addiction to weed. Here's what I've learnt:

1. Weed addiction is serious addiction, don't let anybody tell you any different. The facts are the science isn't available on the reality of weed addiction and our culture loves to deny weed addiction. This adds to the denial inherent in our weed addiction which is and was a huge part of my problem with surrendering and accepting the reality that I am powerless to weed. I cannot control my use and my life becomes unmanageable when I  use. It has taken me 25 years and being in recovery to understand and accept this and I still have trouble with it! Denial is a motherfucker. 

2. The cravings, withdrawals and recovery process takes a long time in heavy weed addiction. The neural connections from heavy weed use have been formed over and over again, each time we had an urge to smoke or use weed products, BAM! we strengthened that neural pathway even more. Each time we don't give into an urge to smoke we strengthen the neural connection not to use. This takes TIME!  We have to go through the cravings and urges and there is no way out of this. In recovery group tonight we learnt it takes two years for your brain to heal from heavy usage. Expect to have urges, cravings and don't give in. 

3. Lapses and relapses. Expect lapses and relapses. This is part of recovery. Just because you've had a lapse don't turn it into a relapse. Having a lapse is not license to go on a binge. I've done this SO MANY TIMES and trust me it gets harder and harder to 'start again'. Do a relapse plan, reach out when you have lapsed, don't turn it into an excuse to binge and tell yourself ""Fuck it, I might as well have a last hurrah""....this is toxic and chips away at your faith in yourself to quit.

4. Recovery. I spent years thinking I could quit by myself. This is again a part of denial about addiction that kept me stuck in the cycle for many years. The truth is not many addicts stay sober. We need help, we need support, not many of use can quit by ourselves (if you can then power to you friend). Reach out for help, whatever form that takes. For me I needed to be in an recovery programme. I was to far into weed addiction and I couldn't do it myself.  I needed to be accountable and to take my weed addiction seriously. This is a serious addiction and I was really fucked up over it. I'm in early days in recovery but I know I need a programme to help me. Don't be wilful, go to NA or MA anonymous meetings, go to rehab in patient or outpatient, be honest with yourself. Its the only way to get out of it.

Look at the process of quitting the same way you look at learning a new hobby, starting a new job, or just going through life in general. The progress is not linear. Nothing in life is a straight line up without any downfalls. It's a rollercoaster with ups and downs. But if you stick with it long enough and you have the right mindset, you WILL succeed. 

I can't emphasize enough how important having the right mindset is. Think about all you have accomplished in life and how you accomplished it simply by setting the mindset of achieving it, and working at it everyday. Nothing worth while comes easily.

I love it, it's fun, makes things more enjoyable, love the smell, the vibe when you get that 'buzz' in your head. but it's clearly giving me negative side effects.","My first hit was about 4 years ago when I was in college. Back then, I saw weed as something cool that most rappers used. My seniors used it, so I told myself, why not give it a try. Ever since that day, I always looked forward to the days me and my friends smoke together, I even mark them as if they're a special day. But things started to change when I got my own bong and started smoking alone. At first, I only took small doses, but it becomes increasingly addictive for me as I ramp up my dose ever since. I even felt days when I smoke for the whole day and felt 'little to no' high.

I've fallen back at school, in my job search, in my overall career, got really fat due to daily munchies, friendship, relationship with my family & girlfriend, my degrading memory, my love for every hobby that I had, etc. For me at least, I felt way less 'sharp' than since I started smoking. It distracts me from my responsibilities and makes me slip on a lot of them. It's kinda clear for me that the negatives DO outweigh the positives. But it's something that I really enjoy, a part of me loves it so much, and the other hates it. 

While weed is a substance most people can live with daily, I don't think I'm able to handle it. I tried practicing self-control and mindfulness but I kept failing. Tried quitting the 4th time, and my longest was only because I was located in a country without weed. Even on my 7th month there, I still feel like I'm missing them. I'm afraid that I won't be able to let it go as even if I was sober for a really long time, I couldn't stop thinking about it.

They make it so easy to get weed into your hands, glorified its greatness through celebrities, and showed how 'safe' it is, when in fact, for me, it's making me lose my mind. 

I don't assume that these side effects happen to everyone, but in my experience with it, I become less of who I am, every day.

I don't know who I am anymore, I lost the motivation and discipline I used to have. I lost the ability to love myself and I have suicidal thoughts honestly almost every day. I always hated myself for not becoming the person who I dreamt of, as the instant gratification weed gives me, made me lazy and not improve. While I seem normal to my friends and family, as they felt that I live a good and stable life. I kept telling them that my 'depression' is real but they see it as another episode of me being sad. The truth is that I can't keep up with this cycle of ""smoking, quitting, being tempted, surrendering"" anymore. I don't know where else to find help. 

Weed haunts me every day with the thought that things will never get better, that I will (always) surrender myself to it, becoming the stoner that I always hated when I'm sober. I hate myself for not being responsible, for being a coward, and hiding from my problems.

Honestly, it's difficult for me to imagine proceeding with life without weed tempting me daily. I just wish I have never taken that first hit.

I stopped cold turkey, which is not the easiest but corresponds to my ""all or nothing"" personality. What helped me a lot was having a behavioral approach: I thought a lot about why, when and how I smoked cannabis. In my case, I understood that cannabis and coffee were a vicious couple: one served to cancel the other and vice versa. Stopping both at the same time made quitting a lot harder at first, and a lot easier in the long run.

After that, what motivated and helped me enormously was to use the money saved (we are not talking about money when it is a huge subject) to carry out projects that I had for many years: I redone the decoration of my living room, I finally fitted out my terrace etc ... The bad point in my case is that I regained some weight ... but hey, nothing really bad that I can't fix quickly.

It's been a month and today what remains the most difficult and by far very far are my dreams and nightmares: they are so vibrant that I wake up tired, disturbed and sometimes in a mental state that is not easy to manage without coffee. : D But it gets better one day after another, I hang on.

All natural parts of life and I am by no means unusual.  I am 50 years old and as I get older, I just add to the shame, anxiety, depression, failure, and regret lists.

Sometimes the negative voices in my head would get so loud and physically heavy that in my desperation I would do anything to make it stop.  This voice was of my peers, my family, my boss, my church, my community - you name it - taunting me and telling me how much I suck and I would get defensive, angry, and depressed. 

Enter THC.  In 2014, I crumbled due to a series of events and I started smoking it every night.  It numbed the shame, anxiety, depression, failure, and regret when I was high.  The voices were not able to speak up when I was high.  

Then I would wake up the next morning and the negative voices would BLARE so I would do everything in my power to accelerate my day including canceling events, commitments, leaving work early, claiming illness (yep, I lied!), etc. so I could get high ASAP and check out again.  Anything to make the negative voices that tortured me incessantly to stop!  Please - just STOP!   Tomorrow I will do something about my problems...tomorrow.  

And tomorrow would come and the cycle re-started.  

6.5 years later I am sober at 43 days and here is what I learned about those negative voices:  those voices are MINE.  My brain is what is torturing me.  If the people who were cruel to me in the past or who do not like me KNEW that I was torturing myself on their behalf - they would be DELIGHTED.  No one is saying these awful things to me BUT ME.  

I am torturing myself.  I am the source.  Yes, shitty things happened in the past and I have been hurt or caused pain but the taunting?  The name calling?  The constant reminders of failure?  That's ME!  I am doing that.  

So, something to ponder when your negative voices are kicking the shit out of you - ask yourself why you are torturing yourself on behalf of someone else?  Do you know these things your negative voices are saying to be REALLY true (as in you have evidence)?  The more we repeat things the more our brains believe them.

Anyhow - I couldn't have figured this one out had I not been sober.  It's helping.  Hope it helps all of you who are suffering as well.

I quit in December - both weed and alcohol- due to some health issues. (Reflux and constant throat clearing so bad I almost had to go to emergency at it was blocking my airway) and while I have seen some progress in things I can handle now that were way too overwhelming before,  I still have some pretty bad anxiety days. I lost about 25 pounds due to eating restrictions at that time. Was scary.. thankfully it seems I can eat a wider variety of food now again... This is a big relief for me.

At the very start I couldn't handle watching any TV. I couldn't handle reading any books. I couldn't deal with anything that had ANY conflict at all. When you think about it, pretty much every book, tv show and story has conflict in it. I was reading books like No rthanger Abby and pride and prejudice, Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn.. old old boring stuff just to get by. Later I found that I could watch the gold shows on TV like goldrush and especially Aussie gold hunters and jade fever... (Oh no, I've binged them all now!)

Now I've had some progress on this and got back into a book series I read the last time I quit 20 years ago. (TA Barron's Merlin series) and have even watched the latest season of the expanse on Prime. There are still shows I have trouble with that I know I love, but I just can't seem to bring myself to watch like Vikings and The walking dead. (I did watch the first episode of this season's WD though the other day)

I've watched all the Gotham garage stuff which was easy to handle and thinking about getting into fast and loud now. 

I haven't really watched the news since December. I use to watch the morning News and evening News every day. 

I'm always trying to peptalk myself too. Some days it feels like my brain will just do whatever it wants. It's hard to bring it down most times. When I'm trying to chill out and relax my brain tells me I should be up and doing something.

 Almost like I'm wasting precious minutes of my life so go do something type stuff..  I go for walks and ride the mountain bike and tire myself out... I have to almost force myself to relax. I'm into my fifth month now and while I can actually tolerate some things I couldn't a couple months ago, the anxiety can still be pretty powerful some days. I really try to focus on those seemingly little advances and make them stand out more.  I really try to make these advances be bigger... They are my things I hold onto and think about in the bad days...

Tomorrow will be my second counselor appointment and I finally get to see a psychologist in May (BC healthcare system is stretched out so bad right now I'm very lucky to get in this early. I've been waiting for months but it could have been a year) My GP doc has been really trying to help in the meantime. 

Married with kids and self employed so things can get pretty stressful. I'm really trying to focus on my small victories and try my best to live in the present. 

I quit once before about 20 years ago and it was the same experience. I try not to blame myself for getting into it again but now I know for sure I'll never slip again.i wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone... 

 It took me almost a year last time to get ""back to normal"". About 7 months to feel at least better if I remember right. 

Right now I am really really really looking forward to losing this freaking anxiety.. really hoping I see even more progress into the summer.... I honestly can't wait to feel better. Everyone says to be gentle and be kind to myself and I'm trying, but it's really hard to feel this anxiety.. 

Today isn't as bad thankfully so I'm going to go outside now for a walk with the dog and just put one foot in front of the other.... I know that in a few months I'll have even more progress. It's just frustrating and hard knowing how slow it is.

By the way, I checked into the discord chat this morning for the first time. I wish I knew about it sooner, and I also wish it would just stay on all day so we could just pop in as we need it. Being alone most of the day here, it would really help to chat at any time we might need. 

Thank you all for this Reddit and the support and positivity that is given here. People like me who need all we can get are very thankful for it.

So well, that it‚Äôs been hard to escape a niggle in the back of my head that tells me I‚Äôm going to slip up again at some point. It almost feels inevitable, because my entire adult life has followed this exact cycle:


1. I quit smoking weed and initially I feel great, making all kinds of positive changes and basically getting my shit together.

2. I start to become obsessively perfectionist with everything I do because deep down I don‚Äôt feel good enough. I get caught in comparing myself to others who are better looking, more successful, more charismatic than me etc.

3. Suddenly life becomes a chore and the things that I did because they felt good now become things I have to do to feel good. Then, the constant stress and anxiety eventually makes even that stuff stop making me feel good.

4. I burn out from exhaustion and become depressed, usually for months on end. By this point I have completely isolated myself and my day generally consists of nothing but watching tv, eating junk food or drinking.

5. I get so sick of being depressed and wanting to die that I think to myself ‚Äúwait a minute, why the fuck am I not smoking weed?‚Äù I decide to relapse, start seeing my friends again, the weed starts to make me feel a lot better and suddenly I‚Äôm the best I‚Äôve felt in months.

6. I continue smoking weed until my tolerance is so high that I‚Äôm spending ¬£15 - ¬£30 a day simply to avoid the withdrawal effects.


Rinse and repeat. My life for the past 5-6 years.


So yeah, I‚Äôm doing well. I‚Äôm going to the gym, I‚Äôm playing guitar, speaking to friends and family. But I‚Äôm scared because I just want to break this cycle and this voice telling me I can‚Äôt is already starting to affect me. I‚Äôve tried a lot of different therapies over the years and while it‚Äôs helped with getting some insight, I‚Äôm still more or less exactly where I‚Äôve always been.

I don‚Äôt mind having ups and downs in life, I just want to have the strength to actually get on with life while those things occur. I can‚Äôt deal with depression anymore, I really can‚Äôt. It keeps getting worse to the point where now I really fear for my health.

Because of my long streak sober (since may, 20) I was able for the first time to understand exactly the contrast of my brain sober and high.

Conclusion: I saw that beeing high is not a thing to do daily, weekly of even monthly!!!

I am in a stage of my life where the high part of me don't give me the skills I am in need to rank up in my career so, probably I will not smoke for more 6 months!!!!

I know this because I took the proof turning my self in the guinea pig, but I do not recomend nobody here doing it because I don't know how was your relationship with weed. Mine was toxic and I'm sure that if I come back to smoke in a daily basis my life will soon fall in a spiral of bad waves where I don't finish tasks and feel regretfull for it.

Other reason (maybe the main) to keep far from smoking is the brain fog I had for 5 years and don't want her back (neither you). My mind stills sharp because I didn't smoke more than 0,3g but I know that if I continue to hinder THC to fill my fat cells I am going to become the same shit man I was before last year.

So.. this is it, this report is directed to those ""dinosaur quitters"" with more than 6 months clean that may be thinking about tasting her again. Be sure to register how wonderfull you are now if you want to make this crazy thing I did, for this you will drop out the wave knowing that her left you worst than when you entered.

I'm feeling better - a lot better. It took a while, probably 5 or 6 months before things started to really feel ""normal"" again (whatever normal is).

The most important thing I realized through all of this is that it was more about changing my lifestyle and general approach to life than just quitting weed. I developed a lot of bad habits over those 20 some years, whether weed was to blame for that or not I don't know, but I suspect it at the least played a role. In anycase the only way things are going to and have improved for me is if I make an effort to change these negative things about myself. Most relates to my thought patterns and habitual ways of thinking.

The first thing is, I was a master of putting things off until tomorrow - ""I'll do that tomorrow, I'll deal with that tomorrow"" it was easy to do that and not care about it when high and then subsequently suffer through the worry about said thing when not high, contributing to my desire to then get high again.

The second thing, related to the above is negative thought rumination. I'd spend way too much time thinking about negative stuff, sometimes the above, sometimes something else. I've come to realize that the root cause of these negative thoughts and ruminating over them is because I failed to take action. The negative thoughts would continue to loop because I hadn't actually done anything to address them.

The best place for your mind to be is on the here and now, if something is interfering with that then its a good place to start work to fix things. Weed really degraded my mental wellbeing and it was such a slow and cumulative process that I failed to see how severe it actually was until recently.",364,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992524981498718}"

Quick background: im a man of 21 and ive been smoking everyday for about 3 years now. Ive been trying to quit, somewhat pathetic, for 2 years. I finally was able to do it when the first lockdown happened. I felt the best I had ever felt in my entire life. I was becoming a man that I was proud of. 5 months into quitting, I thought I had a hold over my addiction and I took a hit of a wax pen (my favorite means of getting high). You can guess the rest. Within a month I was back to daily smoking. 

Fast forward 5 months to yesterday and I had a conversation I would have never imagined possible. I come feom a strict Muslim family and three days ago my parents found out I smoke. This i thought was the worst that could happen. They were very disappointed in me and obviously devestated.  Yesterday i came honest and said it to them point blank: ‚Äúi am an addict‚Äù

What came next I could‚Äôve never imagined. They turned full on supportive and my mother said to me ‚Äúwe can do this‚Äù. That was the best thing i couldve heard. Youd be surprised what being honest with the ones you love can do for you. Quitting is not easy and we truly do not have to do it alone. 

i am now 6 days clean and will never touch weed in my life again. I now know that I am not one to enjoy the drug occasionally. And while that is a bit hard to deal with since I do love being high, I love my life and my family much more. There are way better ways to get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù.

Last time I smoked was 12th of November 2020. In my blunt-induced brain haze I was dead sure that I need to quit (as I was for the previous couple of weeks), and I was weirdly calm about it. I was like ""I need to lose this shit. That's the last time I smoke, so I better have some fun with my last high."" And, to the contrary to most previous highs, it was cool. No bad thoughts, no kicking myself for getting high again, I went for a long walk and even spent 40 minutes on the phone with my mom (something I couldn't previously manage high). 13.11.2020 was my first day with the realization I won't smoke weed anymore.

Anyway, hope you survived this lengthy intro. Here are 10 things I learned in that time. These are not all positive.

1.I had some mental problems I didn't deal with for a good couple of years. I'm still visiting a psychologist at least twice a month after my depression resurfaced. It's way better now, but I have to completely change my way of thinking about myself, others and the world around me. If you suspect you have mental or psychological issues you are hiding with weed, get help. Definitely.

2.My motivation pattern changed. When I was high I had those short bursts of ""yeah, let's do this. let's rock this shit."" Right now my motivation is toned down, but more consistent. I like it more this way.

3.I'm living life more. I'm more active, I have new hobbies, I'm more consistent in what I'm doing. I'm still learning to be social and reach out to people again, but it's ongoing process as well.

4.The world around me seems to consist of more elements. I listen to the birds chirp, I look at the clouds, I notice cool car colours around me. It's a blast.

5.I'm way more snappy, especially at small things. When big problems arise I'm cool with it, but when I drop a bottle of shampoo I lose my shit. When somebody asks me for help when I'm doing something, I get irritated. I guess weed made my mind mellow, and I lost that mellowness.

6.I know what triggers my mood and act accordingly. I was a bit of a doomer (those thoughts are still close to me), so I stay away from geopolitics, local politics, lengthy coronavirus discussions, etc. I know what I need to know, I don't need to swim in the world of negativity.

7.The life is way more boring. Don't get me wrong here. I fill out the time better so I try not to get bored, but when I'm doing nothing, the time passes very slowly.

8.My mind is sharper than it used to be. It's still not as sharp as I would like it to be, but it's way better now that I'm sober.

9.How many things happen around me daily, and how much I could have missed. I got married in February (a very small, civil ceremony, we're waiting for church wedding still). I'm helping my parents with their summer house they are building, my niece turns 10 this year. And it's great, I love being there and helping. I won't even try to estimate how much I have missed, both because I was living in another city, and because I was thinking about getting high instead of being with my family and friends.

10.Speaking of friends, I came to a sad realization that I lost most of them. Those I grew up with are almost all thinking about getting high and/or drunk. Luckily I have a group of friends from my university and a couple of buddies, so it's not like I don't have anyone to talk to. I still need to learn how to care about those close to me.

She looked at me with sadness and out of nowhere came and hugged me for a long time very hard and she just went back to play. It's like she felt my sadness, my emptiness.

Longest I‚Äôve ever gone without herb since I was 16. I‚Äôm 26 now. One thing I‚Äôve learned is that almost all my friends have been made over the years because we have connected through smoking. I love my friends so much as people but it just happens to be the truth. I love to do so many things, music, basketball, surfing. And anytime I just ride solo and do things on my own I end up doing what I love more often. The loneliness sinks in but I feel more whole by staying the course and doing what I enjoy even if it means not seeing my friends as often. That said, I‚Äôve been able to be in 3 different situations around friends who were smoking and had little to no temptation to give in and smoke. I used to always justify it after a certain point, but I‚Äôve been able to limit these encounters just cause I want to trust myself even more. But it‚Äôs nice to be able to say no, even if it means not getting to enjoy the company of my friends as much because I just know it‚Äôs what I need right now. I also turned down a trip to Austin with friends from high school. I‚Äôm sad to have to do this, but I feel like it‚Äôs just making me accountable to make better decisions and avoid being in risky situations that will compromise my sobriety.

I‚Äôm not going to sugar coat it, it fucking sucks at first. But even after about a week I saw a lot of benefits. 

My appetite started to come back around day 7 although I know it‚Äôs different for everyone. The last couple days I‚Äôve been hungrier than I have in a long time which is a good feeling after not being able to eat more than fruits and light smoothies for a week. I have way more motivation to do my school work than I ever did while being baked all day and procrastinating. One downside to this is that my brain likes to tell me I deserve a ‚Äúreward‚Äù for working so hard but exercise and talking to your friends helps a lot. 

Daily walks are key, stick some headphones in and go outside and just walk and try to clear your mind. Lifting was actually very hard for me at first because I was dropping so much weight I saw myself definitely losing some muscle which was not encouraging at all and on top of that I couldn‚Äôt eat enough protein so I just avoided that for the first week and replaced lifting with walks. 

My anxiety is very on and off but just reminding yourself of the reason for this can help you overpower anxiety and panic attacks, as hard as it may be just try to think positively and take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Avoid friends that smoke, this is how I almost relapsed. I think we all know people who smoke weed like to act like it has zero downfalls and is completely beneficial. Don‚Äôt even try to argue with them just avoid them becuase the chances are your brain will tell you ‚Äúah it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôve made it this long, if they can handle it then I can‚Äù. 

Anyways I‚Äôve been feeling a lot more fulfilled, some times are tougher than others but I feel that I have more control over my emotions especially compared to the first few days. Just keep pushing guys you can change your life, there‚Äôs a price if you want to live your dreams.

Hey you lot, great community, been coming here for advice and just to know there are others like me for years, but here I am ready to take the next step.

My dad died when my younger brothers and I were all less than 4 years old. He was an engineer in the navy, died of an accident. My mum brought us up very well, my grandparents were involved, I don't look back at this time as abusive or anything. It was filled with love (and pain) but we were happy, and had opportunities. My mum met someone new and we grew up in a musical household, my stepdad ran a recording studio, and through this, my mum began smoking pot, I was about 12 when I first smelled something, and 13 when it was confirmed to me what that smell in the house was.

Roll forward almost 25 years, and I've been essentially a smoker since then. Weekly from 13-16 (stealing a little bit of my mums stash every now and then) and full time when I moved out at 16. There are some issues there, history of bipolar, lots of stuff I need to continue with a therapist, but I'm not ""crazy"" and apart from this addiction, I hold a good job, have now (after dropping out first time) got through to my 3rd year of uni, and about to hit 40 next month.

Pandemic hits, and like a lot of people in my situation (living in a flat on my own) i turned to weed as a way of getting through lockdown. my intake went from approx 7-10g a month right up to almost an ounce (28g) a month. Buying on the darkweb, no other human contact required, I just attend a morning meeting on webex for work, and then just bake away all day getting bare minimum done and avoiding anyone noticing.

12 months later...

We're now coming out of this, albeit slowly, and I have found that I do not recognise myself. I have since moved in with my mum out in the countryside (job is 100% work from home since pandemic hit, so why pay for my flat and not see my family, when I can live with them). My mum has been on her own for 10+ years since my stepdad left. My mum has been smoking weed every day throughout.

There is probably another thread to put in a mental health group somewhere about our relationship and how drugs have affected us, but I'll concentrate on the weed use here....

She is scatty as hell. Most conversations come from nowhere, and rarely is a 2 minute conversation about 1 topic, it jumps around big time. Not only has my mum disappeared into a hole, but I found I was joining her. All of us in our family have smoked for years, so I dont have a leg to stand on when it comes to telling her to quit, none of us do.

Weekend just gone however, we made some progress. We have spoken freely, for the first time, about the ""fog"" that resides over us, the grumpiness every morning, the constant argumentative deflective and defensive behaviour between us was getting unbearable. We both agreed that at least initially, we need a break. We need to support each other, we need to understand and help each other.

My symptoms as I sober up are constantly emotional about everything. I see a rock band, and immediately I'm sad that I didn't spend any more time learning to play guitar. I watch an F1 race, and I'm upset that I quit uni, I attend work meetings, and I'm sad that I'm stuck working for these idiots, instead of them working for me. Usually these thoughts are fleeting, and disappear as I get high, and can then be endlessly amused playing games, watching youtube, pretending to work, etc etc. Now it stops me in my tracks.

Last night it took 4 hours to get to sleep. But I woke this morning and not only felt a bit better, but had the courage to make it real... put it out there, tell you guys that this is happening.

2021 for me needs to be the year that I move on with my life, turn 40, and stop allowing my habitual bahviour to control my life. Weed isn't any more evil than legal drinking, i'm never going to be against its availability, but just like whats out there, there are some of us that can't be trusted with it freely available, and due to our addiction, we need to be much more in control. I'm telling you lot so it helps me to accept this is my new norm. Few more weeks of not getting to sleep, but waking up much fresher, then the nightmares/vivid dreams (had these before, lots of fun, lol) but down the road there will be that day, where I dont argue with people in my head before they say anything. I wont look at the TV and see missed opportunities, i'll see entertainment, and draw from it. I will pick up my guitar (that happened last night) I will attend RC car race meetings, and not just not go at the last minute cos of anxiety, I will wake up each day and decide to live instead.

I hope that this also becomes the road forward for my mum as well, but I know that its what I need for me right now... maybe once I am able to know what day it is without looking at a computer screen first, I might be able to help her in other ways. Lets see.

Wish me luck, this is a tough journey, maybe not as bad as other illegal drug withdrawal, but after 25 years of almost daily smoking, it feels pretty rough, but I know this is what I need to do.... wish me luck people!",23,"{'pandemic': 2, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9916622638702393}"

It's been so long since I last smoked, that I just don't feel the urge to smoke. I do occasionally have the thought that I should smoke weed but nowadays it's easy to dismiss the thought,  as easy as swatting away a fly. 

I can withstand exposure to pot in a social setting without wanting to smoke, something that was impossible earlier.  If weed is lying out in the open,  I no longer gaze at it longingly.  

The fact that I smoked weed, if it comes up, actually shocks people who haven't met me in the years I spent getting high.  Once I offered to roll a joint for someone and he gave me his weed very begrudgingly, something that confused me.  Only later did I realise that he thought I couldn't roll, a skill that I had spent years perfecting.  

And the benefits are undeniable, I live a much more fulfilling life than I did earlier.  Life is more wholesome,  I like to swim,  I like to eat out,  I'm more social and I have interests which don't involve  vegetating on a couch. I'm involved in creative activies and volunteer as well. 

The monetary benefits are immense as well. According to my app, I've saved 5008 AUD, by not smoking. I've taken up investing, and my portfolio keeps on growing as I put the money that I would have smoked into the stock market. It also freed up money to eat out,  enjoy activities that I would not have been able to afford as well as giving me a bit of an impetus to go out.  

Even though life is not going well by certain traditional metrics, I still enjoy life more.  I'm sure that life will work out in the end, even though it is frustrating sometimes. 

Occasionally I meet people who are still struggling, and their patterned behaviour shocks me. The need to have weed, papers, roaches, lighters, tobacco all in arms reach. To use it all again and again to get high. It was a curse that I was stuck in earlier as well and I wish they could break out of it.  

Weed was good while it lasted. It made me feel secure in a time that I felt very insecure.  I moved to a different state to attend uni and I was all alone, never having had to make friends before.  Weed gave me those friends (some  friendships have survived my quitting). It taught me to relax and accept that you don't need to do everything now. 

However,  as time went on,  it consumed my life. I spent atleast 4 hours a day completely bombed out of my mind, and even more hoursin a semi-functional state. It robbed me of ability to be social, and that's something I'm having to learn now.  What's been most striking to me is the additional time I have had.  I've regained an additional 2508 hours of time over the past 627 days.  It's like each year has an additional two months in which I can do something I want to do, or do nothing at all.  It's my choice.  

Anyway, I feel like I have rambled on long enough.  I hope my story reminds you that there is light at the end of tunnel,  something to look forward to once the urges and irritability subsides.  There's a whole world out there, and I wish you all the best on your journey.",496,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.99648118019104}"

Many of you have likely already had one or two day one's just this month. Quitting weed doesn't seem so hard until you decide it's actually time to quit. I can't count how many times I would be in the shower, thinking about how I HAD to quit, disappointed in myself knowing that I had this same internal monologue the other day.

&#x200B;

For most of us here, we've tried to decide ""today is the day I'm putting my foot down and stopping smoking."" Odds are, most didn't succeed with that approach. That's because we're addicted. Our bodies are used to weed. It goes beyond just that part of your brain that tells you it's okay to just smoke this one last time, or for this one minor thing that'll suck to do sober. For me, I would get nauseous. After 24 hours, I would basically be incapable of eating. I justified smoking because I wouldn't eat if I stopped. For others it may be sleeping, productivity, etc. Whatever your justification is, you need to realize that you don't need weed. You've only convinced yourself that you do.

&#x200B;

As I said, if you're addicted, the cold turkey quit likely won't work for most of you. It didn't for me. I finally found a strategy that did work though, and I can confidently say it should for just about everyone if they TRULY want to quit weed. Weaning off at a comfortable pace. For me, I was consistently smoking 3 times a day. In the beginning of January this year, I cut out the morning session and went down to 2 times a day. For about two weeks, I was smoking 2 times a day. Then one day I was busy so I only smoked 1 time at night. I did it again the next night, and for the next week or so 1 time at night was a pattern. Eventually I missed a night, and started smoking every other night for about a week. I then decided I was going to do 2 nights without it. I did those 2 nights without, and on the night I had planned on smoking I realized I didn't need to. So I didn't. And I haven't since.

&#x200B;

April 11th will mark two months since I last smoked. After failing to quit for almost a year, I was truly terrified that this addiction was out of my control. I could not go a day without smoking if I had access to weed. I started to think about my future wedding day, wondering if I would be high while saying my vows or at the wedding party because I would eventually need it to keep my day going. Everyday I was constantly ashamed of my lack of control over my own life. The worst part? I was too ashamed to let others even know how out of control it was for me, so I had to carry all that emotional baggage myself.

&#x200B;

I take care of myself more, I enjoy socializing more, I procrastinate less, I'm more productive... the list goes on. I can go days at a time now without even thinking about weed. If you're worried about withdrawals, I can promise that they are much more minimal if you wean off. The only thing I truly dealt with was the incredibly vivid dreams. If you TRULY, GENUINELY know that you want to quit weed but just can't get yourself to give it up, I urge you to try this approach. I promise that if you put in the effort to phase it out, it works.

I know I need to stop at least for a little while because I'm fully dependent on it and spend half my paychecks on weed. 

My memory is shot from smoking for so long. When I'm sober all I feel is anger and anxiety and the constant need to smoke. I've been ""done"" for a week but actually haven't gotten high for 3 days. I hate how much I want to go blow another almost $300 at my favorite dispensary. I dont have an appetite unless I'm absolutely baked. I despise how my life is like this and want to have the self control to just not get high. 

I really dont like being sober for any reason other than I guess I can think more clearly and process information way quicker. The main reason to stop is for work, because while I don't smoke before my shifts, if I get into an accident at work I have to take a UA (Urinary Analysis) and will definitely fail and there's the same guy who almost hits me every week and I just can't risk it. Another is for my girlfriend because even though I've been smoking way longer than I know her she hates the way it smells and how I don't like being sober, which I can't help. 

Being sober makes my depression feel way worse, where if I'm high I usually get into a depressed thought/mood and then forget about it. I cant forget about it when I'm sober. It just envelopes me until I dont even have the energy to move. 

All I've wanted to do for the last 3 days is light up so I can enjoy my time again, but I keep telling myself that maybe I can enjoy life again if I just force sobriety on myself and learn how it is to be fully sober. I hate how my alternative is to just drink, because alcoholism runs in both sides of my family and I'd much rather smoke weed than black out every night.

Hopefully it‚Äôll help someone or answer anyone‚Äôs questions that they might have about quitting.

I been smoking for about 2-3 years. I never really had any previous anxiety problems or anything. I only started smoking because I wanted to try it, a lot of my friends did it so I finally gave in to temptation. I‚Äôve always been a cautious person what I put in my body or smoke. After trying weed for the first few times I was hooked. I started doing it every now and then and then that turned into every day. There were times I went a couple days without it especially if I was sick but I‚Äôd pick it right back up. I started doing edibles and dabs and carts also. I don‚Äôt like being high all the time because I like to enjoy things sober also but being high felt like so much fun and made things better. Some days I‚Äôd get high because work sucked or just wasn‚Äôt having a good day, but I never just straight blazed 24/7. There were very few times I got a little too high for my own liking. Well last year around this time when Covid started becoming a real big thing I had my first panic attack. Not sure exactly what triggered it because I wasn‚Äôt high when it happened but it scared the hell out of me. Well I decided to keep smoking a little each day to help with my stress and hopefully prevent me from having anxiety. 

Fast forward to this year, at the end of January I ate some edibles and got so high I thought I was dieing. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I couldn‚Äôt eat, I couldn‚Äôt focus, it scared me so much that I decided I should probably quit or at least do it once every now and then. Well February 14 was the last time I got high so I‚Äôve been sober for almost 2 months now. I decided to go ahead and put it down for good because everytime I got high it just made me nervous after that bad trip I had. 

Not gonna lie, I do miss getting high sometimes but I honestly don‚Äôt care to especially when I think about that one bad trip I had. The only thing that sucks is that my wife does smoke so I am around it on a daily but like I said I don‚Äôt care to smoke it anymore. Now my experience being sober. I never heard of withdrawals from bud but I will say this, I believe in it now. Everybody is different but for me, I was a bit edgy for the first week or two but nothing major. I‚Äôm not sure why but it wasn‚Äôt until about two weeks ago is when like everything hit me, I had anxiety so bad for almost a whole week, shivers and sweats at night, feeling weak, no motivation whatsoever, insomnia wasn‚Äôt too bad but only because I was tired and weak. I was also slightly sick because I have terrible allergies (which is another reason I decided to quit) so I‚Äôm sure that didn‚Äôt help with my anxiety because I literally thought everything was wrong with me. I thought I was sick, having heart attacks, brain seizures, and a whole bunch of other stuff because my digestive system was acting up and I barely ate at all. I also lost my sex drive (sorry if that‚Äôs a bit too much info.) 

I‚Äôm definitely feeling a good bit better now. My appetite is slowly coming back. Some days I‚Äôll be hungry a good bit and some days I just dont really feel like eating much. I‚Äôm hoping my digestive system will go back to normal because for some reason it‚Äôs like clock work right now, majority of the time I only have to go as soon as I get up in the morning and that‚Äôs weird to me. My anxiety has stayed pretty low so far as long as nothing completely stresses me out. I will admit the boredom sucks, it doesn‚Äôt make me have cravings but I just really hate it so I try to find something to do to occupy my time. Mornings are still struggle for me, it feels like I have no motivation to get up and I‚Äôm still tired and my anxiety feels a bit higher when I get up in the morning. I will say that I do have more motivation to get up now than when I was smoking but I‚Äôve never been a morning person to begin with. I still feel tired sometimes through out the day but I‚Äôm hoping all this gets better with time. I‚Äôm definitely able to focus a good bit more and remember stuff better now. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll improve over time. I don‚Äôt regret quitting, I just want everything to go back to normal now.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9916071891784668}"

So, this is day two of what I plan to be many. I've been a chronic daily smoker for about 3 years now.

I've always had an issue with the portrayal in the media of what a weed smoker who's addicted looks like. They're always fat, anti-social, dirty, despicable and disfonctional. I always had difficulty to come to terms with my shitty situation because of it. I'm in my mid twenties, did sports at a national level, been in decent relationships, never failed at school, etc. 

The one thing about substance abuse that they never seem to talk about is those who suffer from it, yet remain fully(ish) functional. When I'm saying functional, I'm talking from the others' viewpoint. Hell, I've been in a relationship for two years now and my girlfriend doesn't even know I smoke daily. She thinks I'm casual ""once a week smoker"". For the most part, getting away with it just fine is what got me into this mess.

Whether it's not being able to sleep, not having appetite, not having fun with whatever activity...I can tell you, if you smoke one it won't get better because you will get back to habits and that's what you've been addicted to.

Its like i talk to myself, that i will try tomorrow again, now i somehow wave managed to hold 3 days not smoking first hours until I'm back from work. I kind of have ADHD but I'm not sure, perhaps the symptoms are just too much weed in my life. I am not eating correctly, to be honest, not eating at all would be more accurate. When I'm busy doing work stuff, i don't crave it. The thing is with free time, i have 0 interest in anything except getting high, even things i loved before doesn't excite me. I even cant choose what to eat at shop, nothing ""looks tasty"" if you guys can relate.

&#x200B;

I no longer post here often though the support I see on my feed still stirs strong emotions in me because I recall how helpful you all were as I came to terms with the depths of my problem with dope. 

&#x200B;

When I do post I see it as reaching out to start a conversation with anyone who might feel they can relate to what I'm experiencing in an acute way. Most of us can relate to one another in some form but it is the more specific issues I have with abstinance and usage that I hope may click with a few of you. Failing that, perhaps this can serve as a warning to those of you not yet entirely stranded in the deep end. 

&#x200B;

I've tried - and failed - to keep this short. Feel free to skip the following four paragraphs to get to the crux of the post.

&#x200B;

I believe I first began having thoughts about quitting many many years ago, sometime in my mid twenties, just shy of a decade past, but like many of you I'm sure, the endevour seemed impossible at the time. My friends all smoked, many as heavily as me, I live in a place where it is not hard to smoke in public, nor has it ever been hard for me to smoke in private, circumstance did nothing to deter me. My thoughts on stopping just seemed inconcievable, even if I felt like I really wanted it, I was certain it wouldn't happen, and until quite recently I was correct.

&#x200B;

In 2019 a series of health problems prompted doctors to become severely worried I had a serious illness, which in turn caused my mental health to plummet. Obviously then, giving up was the easiest decision I'd ever made, and this sub helped me through several months of withdrawl, which on top of the health troubles was a hard experience that I was glad to see the back of.

&#x200B;

I kept clean until Covid, I'm sure many of you had the same struggles whether you succumbed to them or not. The uncertainty and lockdown was all my mind needed to allow apathy to take hold, and I began smoking again. In September I encountered a new health problem, ceased again, was two months later diagnosed with a common affliction, easily treated, and not long after during a November lockdown returned to the habit.

&#x200B;

To show such disdain for my mental and physical health after going through such shit on more than one occassion proves the power of apathy and the draw of weed. I recall thinking this January, 'you're just gonna keep smoking until another health issue befalls you', and lo and behold, that's what happened. Now I'm six weeks into a period of nigh on constant abdominal pain which refers from under my ribs up my back and down to my stomach, all on the right handside. As before, the doctors are gradually one upping the checks and tests, scratching their heads at the lack of other symptoms and showing no urgency, which now I must say I am used to, and is to probably be expected in the thick of a pandemic. 

&#x200B;

Now with my personal history concluded, if this post has point I believe it is this: For all the fear I have had as an adult about the damage smoking is doing to my body, knowing deep down that to do something so unhealthy to such excess is tantamount to slow suicide, I have in fact failed to actually realise that the damage is far far greater than that to my lungs and my mind. The appallingly bad habits that come with habitual use are much more clandestine and easy to ignore, especially over long periods. Some off the top of my head: A complete disregard for a secure or comfortable or fulfilling future. No savings, no creative talents, no second language, several aborted relationships that were in fact very healthy until I let the addiction wash them away, the only positive being I know those people I cared for deeply did not allow me to waste more of their time. No money for travel and thus no exploration of other cultures. Disregard for my family who have been nothing but supportive thanks to my ability to be a 'functional' addict. Very little focused exercise, which could have been an even bigger problem if I didn't work on my feet, but nevertheless. 

&#x200B;

And playing on my mind worse than any other, thanks to this new growing discomfort I have in my body, is the way smoking dope affects your appetite, what you eat, and when you eat it. As a sober human, I eat both healthily and unhealthily, fruits and vegetables in fair quantity, balanced meals, as well as being parshall to things like chocolate and salty foods like ramen and occassionally red meat and processed shit. I imagine most people are like this; middle of the road. As a long term smoker - though the meals I eat are mostly as mentioned above, the insatiable munchies that I experience on a pretty much daily basis inspire me to snack and eat awful food day in, day out. That means after dinner I'm spamming entire share bags of doritos to myself, giant bars of milk chocolate, sweets of all varieties, and all this happening in the late evening, when your body doesn't want more food, when your organs are not properly prepared to deal with the tidal wave of shit you're ploughing into yourself. It can't tell you directly it doesn't like you doing this, you might get stomach pain from time to time, not severe enough to care about, especially when stoned, but until you're in really bad health it's unlikely you'll know. And because the dope drives you to follow these base instincts and desires while rendering you incapable of caring enough to deny yourself the momentary pleasure, you, if you're like me, will keep doing it on and on until it's just another part of the routine like smoking is, like staying up late is, like spending your money on dope is, and every other counter productive thing I've thought to mention in this post is. 

&#x200B;

Sorry this has dragged on so long, if you read this far I appreciate it. Do you agree then, that this habit just gives birth to more and more insidious habits? So when all are tallied up together the savage consequence on your precious time on earth is impossible to deny? That's how it feels to me, and all I can focus on now, is if and when I am over this new issue with my health, for the rest of my life I will be trying to fight the apathy and the addiction to the death, to try and somehow remember that this now is pretty horrifying, frightening, and not something I ever want to experience again.

I‚Äôm new to Reddit and this is my first post. Been looking for help with quitting marijuana. I have made an appointment to talk with a doctor next month. But would also like some advice from other while I wait till my appointment. 
I am a stay at home dad going to college full time online. I currently use about 4-5 times a day and take hits off of a vape pen. I don‚Äôt get high anymore unless I smoke an excessive amount. 
I have cravings throughout the day that I can fight sometimes with exercise or just finding something to do. Where I have a problem is in the morning. Around 5 in the morning I wake up to nausea. This isn‚Äôt everyday but almost always when I‚Äôm trying to quit. I think it has something to do with anxiety and withdrawal symptoms. I‚Äôm really just trying to get an idea of how people deal with this?

I loved being high. I truly felt like I was my ‚Äúbest‚Äù when I smoked weed. Everything in life was more enjoyable to me. Although, I have never smoked before or during work as I know that would feel awkward for me. 

Day to day activities and social events were just so much more intriguing. I felt so connected to everything and everyone when I was high. I was more motivated to work out, go to social events, go on walks, emails and tasks were always completely timely and in good spirit.

If I could think of one and only negative consequence of smoking for me - it would have been ignoring calls from friends and family bc I felt awk about having phone convos while high with my important people. And now of course a huge consequence would be losing my career/ salary which obviously is not worth it. (Although I‚Äôd be lying if I didn‚Äôt question it) 

I just feel so helpless, everyday is getting more and more rough being sober. I feel as if I have a chemical imbalance and that life will never be as fun. 

I know it sounds ridiculous but it‚Äôs truly how I feel. I‚Äôm grieving big time. 

Nauseous, not hungry, not sleeping, crazy wild dreams, irritability, serious lack of motivation and terrible brain fog. 

When will I turn a corner? Any tips to speed up that process? I‚Äôm so afraid that I‚Äôll never turn that corner and return to peace while sober. I feel trapped and scared. 

None of my friends are weed smokers and I don‚Äôt know who to turn too to explain how I‚Äôm feeling- not that they could do anything about it. I truly don‚Äôt think a therapist could cure me from this. I don‚Äôt know why I feel so uncomfortable in my skin while being sober to begin with. Sigh. 

Any tips/advice appreciated my friends. XO

I see all these people saying things about how quitting is what really allowed their full potential and I feel like it could do that to me too. However when I do take extended breaks I can see how emotionally it‚Äôs a rocky experience that will even out but other than that I just feel like my days just run together. 
I just feel like I get up In the morning just to get through the day before I can go back to bed. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm just tired all day I just feel like I lose something, like life just becomes a little more pointless, and is just something to do while we wait to die. I find myself not enjoying a lot of the things I usually like, I find myself just waiting for the next thing I need to do and constantly worried about if I‚Äôm being the most productive or if there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm neglecting. 
I usually only smoke after 8pm if all the things I‚Äôve set out for the day are done and earlier than 8 sometimes if there really is nothing to do. And right now I switched to a pax in an attempt to slowly get off I guess, and I‚Äôm feeling these feelings of quitting starting here and there. With my current schedule I‚Äôll load the pax about every 2-4 days and I‚Äôll sometimes just keep hitting it knowing it‚Äôs not really getting me high but it makes me feel better for some reason. 
Idk I like I see the pros and cons of quitting versus not and I just what if I just am better with it, even if just very small doses. 
Anyone else feel like this?

Another thing I forgot to mention is that when I smoke I usually reflect and I start to think about what I need to do and all. When I‚Äôm sober all I can think about is what I‚Äôve been asked to do.  I become a little colder in the sense I stop caring what anyone has to say unless they are my friend or family. Like if someone at work I kinda know wants to talk I really just cannot wait to get away and just be alone. It‚Äôs nothing wrong with them it‚Äôs more that I just do not care to hear what they have to say and can‚Äôt wait for them to stop. When I‚Äôm not sober (like I had smoke the night before, but am not still high) I actually will listen to them and all and it‚Äôs easier to listen and I don‚Äôt mind letting anyone talk for as long as they want. I realize things that seem obvious like they are their own person and they spend the time to talk to me and I won‚Äôt lose anything with my time spent listening. 
Idk maybe I‚Äôm just fucked up in some way but realizations just seem to come so much easier when I‚Äôm on my smoking schedule. 
I know I‚Äôll have to quit at some point before I graduate college but I just wonder if maybe I am better off with smoking? From one pov it doesn‚Äôt make sense on account of the effects weed has on people, especially long term but on the other hand I‚Äôve seen my life with and without and I just feel like I become to numb to life so easily. It‚Äôs weird I don‚Äôt have to be high to do things  but having smoked recently seems to help me move things along while I am sober.

I pulled myself back, smoked alone or with the few friends that still were in it with me. But it never felt the same anymore.

After this weekend i got a serious realisation, i thought that if im not quitting now, now that all my cherished friends did, i will get lost. Instead of finding new advertures and hobbies like them i would get into somking more and more and as soon as i forget about them, what would my motivation to quit be?

It's my first time posting on this forum (or even on reddit in general :D), but I decided to share my struggles with You to feel like I'm not alone in this. I'm 24, I've been smoking weed for 2 years now, almost every single day for the last year. During this time I managed to take a 1-month break and two 2-week breaks. What definitely doesn't help me in getting sober is how terribly lazy I am. I'm also taking prescribed medication due to my social anxiety and depression. I managed to make a tremendous improvement in my mental health over the course of the last two years and worked out issues stemming from some of my parents' behaviors. I was overly criticized by my father and at the same time had an overprotective mother. I was constantly trying to prove my father that I'm not useless, by being a good student, complying to my parents' rules and punishments. I have even subconsciously tried to take up the same interests he has (rock/metal music, football) only to learn that it doesn't really matter what I do, I'll never feel accepted by him. Thanks to meds and therapy I managed to get back on the right track, stopped blaming myself for never being enough. Unfortunately, prior to that time I have already developed a habit of drinking every second or third day (mostly it were terrible hangovers that kept me from drinking every single day, I'm a Pole btw XD). Once I've started meeting with more weed smokers, it replaced alcohol as my daily-use substance.

At first, I did not mind smoking every day. I was getting better mentally, so I felt some sort of progress and it kept me from feeling bad with myself. I managed to finish up my Bachelor's thesis (the thing that caused my mental breakdown and made me look for a therapist in the first place) and find my first real job. The real problem started to emerge after all of the workers (including me) in our company were forced to work remotely, thanks to the covid pandemic. Unfortunately, this decision occurred 1/1.5 months after I quit meds to be more in touch with my emotions. Working remotely seemed fine for the first two weeks. Then a lot of stress hit me - I'm responsible for a team of Call Center agents and there were plenty of things to take care of, as telephone calls became primary source of communication with our customers. Coming down from medication, fueled by daily weed smoking resulted in paranoia and stress so severe that I started every single day with a diarrhea and was throwing up right after I opened my eyes. After 2 months of struggle I was a wreck and as much as I did not want to go back to prescribed meds I decided I'm not yet fit to face such a stress right after quitting it. I decided to start taking it again. It helped with my anxiety, but due to combining it with weed every single day I felt almost no-stress and no-anxiety, making me extremely lazy on a daily basis. The situation in work started to normalize, the list of to-do tasks was becoming shorter and shorter as the time went by. Up to a point, when I started playing videogames during my work-time. I've been working remotely non-stop since march 2020. Playing videogames was fun, but it was even better while high, so I started smoking in work (up to that point, I was sticking to a rule that on no condition should I ever smoke weed during work). This situation lasted for at least half a year, gradually making me feel worse with what I do (or should I say - don't do XD). In the meantime I've taken up Big Data Master studies at my university, somehow managed to pass the first semester, but needless to say, my results were not really that good.

All of this has finally led me to a decision - I want to quit weed, once and for all. The 1-month break I took made me feel so much better. Of course, at first I felt really bad, couldn't eat, was nervous constantly, always sweaty, couldn't sleep. But after a week I felt like a newborn man, finally had some motivation to do more than just sit on my couch and watch another Netflix show about vampires and werewolves, because it was so ""entertaining"" while I was high, or play another videogame to acquire another platinum trophy (60 and counting, all those hours XD). Unfortunately, due to pandemic I struggled real hard to find any sort of entertainment. I mean, going for a walk is cool, but it gets boring pretty quickly, when it's the only thing You can do outside of your apartment. The same apartment and the same couch that I associate with smoking weed so much. So, after a month I met up with some of my friends, who are also weed smokers and as You can probably imagine, I broke my weed abstinence, which was followed by another 2-weeks of smoking binge which kicked me right back into my habit. I did not manage to make a break longer than a week ever since.

This leads me to a question: ""What other activities can You take up to break loose from this habit?"" I'm not to keen on sports, due to some trauma I experienced in middle-school. But even prior to that, I've never fully enjoyed it. I've tried reading books, but the basic mistake I make is that I always pick up books that might help me develop myself or simply broaden my horizons. After a short while they start feeling like a chore, instead of entertainment. Playing videogames and watching movies is simply a trigger for me to get high, as I have associated these activities with marijuana for far too long. I've tried taking up some online-classes on programming, but just as with books, they became a chore pretty quickly. The real problem is, that my motivation fully gets back after \~1 month of abstinence. Without any activities that might carry me through this time, I'm simply too tempted to get high. It would be great if You could let me know what kinds of activities helped You to get through the withdrawal syndrome time. I quit weed once again yesterday and I really want to make it this time around. Thanks in advance guys, stay safe! Thanks to everyone contributing to this community, I feel much better after sharing my story and venting off a little bit.

tl;dr: I'm 24, smoking for the last two years, almost every single day for the last year. I'm on prescribed meds, quit weed yesterday and am extremely lazy, looking for some activities to get me through this tough time. I'm not too keen on sports, already tried reading, taking up online classes, watching TV shows/movies and videogames. Taking a walk is nice, but I'd like to have some additional ways of fighting this habit.

(Lots of rant and word jumble)","So, for context I'm 19, living with a few roommates. I came from an emotionally abusive family and both my parents abused hard drugs. I have severe PTSD from the events of my entire life until I moved out last year. I have severe clinical depression resulting from this PTSD.

When I was 14, I tried weed for the very first time. It was magical, absolutely beautiful. I smoked it out of an apple in an alleyway and didn't even care. Wandering around my entire tiny town made me feel like I was in another universe.

Well, after that I couldn't figure out where to get it from as I stopped associating with the friend who first introduced me due to a move. Not until I was 17 and fell head over heels for a girl in my art class. We got along naturally and quickly. One day after class we were hanging out, and she asked if I mind her smoking. Well, she said she meant weed. I asked if she would allow me to join her and she shared the love. Got me absolutely rocked. In glory land once again.

We started smoking together a few afternoons/nights a week. It was great. Then it became every day. Then I got a job, and it continued. Eventually, I was smoking when I woke up, between classes, after school, and before bed. My mom was totally cool with me smoking as a fellow MJ fan. We smoked together sometimes.

I was high 24/7. Felt happy and free for the first time since I was around 11 or 12. Eventually my depression and PTSD reared their ugly heads once again. After several suicide attempts and serious self harm that landed me in the ER, I was forced to see an on site psychiatrist. He heard my story and gave me medication. Never sought help before as I assumed I wasn't ""bad enough"" for meds. Was proven very wrong. I started taking it, gave myself seratonin syndrome before I realized I can't smoke weed on it. So, I set out to quit. 

It was horrible. I couldn't sleep, eat, or function for about 3 weeks. But eventually the meds kinda kicked in. I once again felt clear headed and light for the first time since childhood. But I had to stop these particular drugs due to bad side effects, and switched to another. Everything's horrible again. 

I feel no joy in anything except food. No love for my previous hobbies that I did in excess while high. Nothing, really. I have severe IBS and my horrible eating patterns have me in daily pain. But I can't feel any relief from my intense anxiety and looming gloomy doom cloud until I shove 2 chocolate bars and a frozen lasagna down my throat. Pain kicks in. Cycle repeats. 

I've been to therapy, read self help books, and been on meds for my mental illnesses since this whole thing began. And I feel worse than when I was using. You know why? I only figured it out this week, after 7, almost 8 fucking months. 

Because I didn't try to replace weed, I only assumed I could just do what I normally do and be okay. So I've started meditating and doing yoga. Searching for a better job that doesn't make me want to blow my brains out. I'm actively trying to improve myself. 

My memory never improved this whole time. I write in a planner religiously to stay organized. My creativity plummeted. My energy levels plummeted. I'm in constant physical pain. Boredom to go around. But you know what? At least I'm not dependent on an expensive substance every second of every day. I'm not gonna pretend my life is good, it's absolute shit. But that lack of dependency makes it just a teensy fraction better. 


Maybe those of you out there who aren't severely depressed, with horrible PTSD and chronic illness will feel a much more drastic improvement after quitting. For now, I'm gaining weight and struggling to stay alive one day to the next. It just takes thinking about today and today only. Not the past, not the future.

I have been smoking nearly everyday all day for the passed 8 months. Prior to this, I would smoke very rarely with a couple of friends, maybe only a few times a month. During this time I never felt the desire to have to be high, in fact didn't really like the feeling. September I made the mistake of buying my first cart. However, my bestfriend (now gf) and I would share the cart, and I would normally leave it at her house, allowing her to use it whenever since I didn't really care. However, I entered a rough patch at around the same time, being heartbroken, just starting college as a nursing major (since switched to chemistry). The sad part is that I dropped the major partly for fear of drug testing the next year. Anyways, I slowly became consumed by my carts. It began gradually, only being on weekends nights, to all day weekends, to alone at night every night to all day every day, and Im talking wake & bake for months straight. 4ish months into this new addiction I began feeling the effects, numbed emotions, dissociation/derealization and isolation. I lost 2 close friends because all I cared about was getting high. After 8 months of this I am ready to kick it. It is no longer enjoyable and I am a slave to it. It is rough and the cravings are there but I know now is the time to kick the habit for good before it is too late. 

Does anyone have some insight on how long it takes to gain back mental clarity, emotions, motivation, etc?

Hi all,

So Im  really really proud to share that I'm on my first 6 days fully sober from weed in... probably years. I've been an on and off consistent smoker since the age of 18 (I am 24 now.) If I wasn't smoking daily for certain periods, I was still consuming a couple of times a week. At my worst, which was most of the time, I was smoking every day.

Recently, since the start of the pandemic actually, I was smoking more and more often, and in larger quantities. Got to a point where I'd be high from morning to night, even when working from home. My only breaks were days I went to the office, and even then, some mornings I'd have a couple of hits.

Just got fed up with lying to myself, telling myself it's what's helping me and keeping me alive. Wrong. It's what was holding me back from being my best self and honouring my health, mind and body.

My question is (and for reference I am female) did excessive use of cannabis affect your libido negatively? It use to make me horny but that hasn't been the case in years. I live with my partner for almost a year now, and when we first moved in together, sex was regular, about 1-2 times a week. (Our normal, we have a very very similar sex drive so that's a good thing.)

However, I noticed that the more I smoked, the less interested in sex and intimacy I became. To the point where it rarely occurs to me to feel like it. I'm worried about that, of course, because I don't want that aspect of our relationship to suffer. Yes the pandemic and added stress probably contributed, but I wonder if there could be a direct link to my abuse of weed? I honestly couldn't care less when high, which was all the time. 

Did anyone experience this? Did anyone find their libido return to normal throughout their recovery journey? I don't plan on turning back. I don't think I can moderate the usage of this substance, and quite frankly, I don't enjoy it anymore anyway. Just makes me depressed, anxious and complacent.

I really want to return to my normal, and I'm trying to weigh what the possible culprits could be. I have a history of sexual abuse in my childhood and I am aware that trauma can have an effect on sexual relationships, even years later, especially the closer you get with someone, as it is difficult to learn to associate sex with intimacy. I am working on that with my therapist, but I'm curious to know if my substance abuse could have had an effect on my libido too. (Due to depression I imagine?)

Any advice, relatable story, opinions and ""what to expect""s are appreciated and welcome.

Thank you so much in advance to anyone that reads this / comments, this sub is a safe place I am super grateful to be a part of.

Edit: any mention of cannabis being wrong was mentioned in relation to my personal experience. I do not believe cannabis is inherently wrong. I simply meant that I am unable to control my usage despite wanting to, and that it is bringing ME more negative than positive. It simply isn't something I can moderate.

I had been disqualified from a study about pot smokers because I smoked too much. (‚ÄúI can‚Äôt recommend that you continue at your current level of usage,‚Äù the researcher had said when he found out I smoked every day.

Marijuana had granted me peace, and as someone with depression and PTSD, peace is not easy to come by.

For most of the past four months, I have struggled to remember why I quit. I thought I would have more energy, get out of bed more easily, accomplish more. None of this has proved true. In fact, the only thing that seemed to have changed was that I felt bored a lot more often. When explaining my decision to smokers, I‚Äôve struggled to make a strong case for sobriety.

The first few years were amazing I felt so connected to reality and so alive. Music was better food was amazing. Spending time with friends was so damn fun. And then things changed my circle got smaller and I started smoking more and more, I could bore you all with the story but I became alone, had nobody (it felt like I had nobody at least) I would smoke just to feel something, so much so I‚Äôd fall asleep in the garage and wake up and take another hit... I couldn‚Äôt speak to anyone anymore abo anything without getting mad for no reason. My social skills and the once confident outgoing young guy I was, was an outer shell of a person I didn‚Äôt even feel real anymore. I questioned reality 24/7. I would get horrible anxiety attacks. Going to the ER just for them to tell me everything‚Äôs fine and at one time got made fun of by the nurse when I explained my symptoms .. On top of the weed I adapted a nicotine habit with disposables. I‚Äôd buy one a day. ( this was very recent within the last year) My stress was through the roof, I‚Äôd hide it from the love of my life, February I got covid.. still smoking through the entire sickness... about 2 weeks of sitting at home doing nothing but smoking while having a terrible sickness I had the worst panic attack of my life. I genuinely thought I was dying it felt like I was tripping on the strongest hallucinogens, completely thought I lost my god damn mind. It took hours for me to calm down, I‚Äôve known for almost a year I needed to stop weed but I was so dependent on it I never stopped until that night it scared me so much I knew I had to listen to my body.

I have practiced good habits like reading for 45 minutes a day. Getting back to my gym routine. I started a stretching routine everyday (yoga) and I‚Äôve talked to my mom once a day everyday. I‚Äôd be lying if I said it was easy... the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever faced and still am facing.

Since the pandemic I have quite smoking a few times, usually around a month or so. I really enjoy my sober time, but like all of us I always have that nagging feeling- ""cmon you can just moderate"" and thus far I","always end up trying again. The cycle always goes something like- I say I can only smoke on the weekends at night, that gets moved up to during the week at night, which then gets moved up of course to the day. 

During my sober time I always realize how much I don't like smoking anymore.... except for wake and bake. Almost instantly after I initially started smoking, I fell in love with the feeling of being high during broad daylight and just going about mundane routines. I preferred it so much more than smoking at night- which often lead to paranoid thoughts. 

But it is undeniable that a wake and bake, then turns into a night time smoking too. Because how could it not? No one wants to be high and then doesn't want to. 

Because I am someone who enjoys wake and bake so much, I could never possibly enjoy moderation. Those things just don't go hand in hand. 

As much as I would love love to be able to morderate with this substance (or any substance), i am just not someone who is able to do that, and i need to accept it and move on.

I just never kicked the weed habit no matter what I did.  I have experimented with a ton of methods trying to quit, and trying to lie to myself and thinking there was no way weed caused me the problems it did.  For example I am terrified to go in public, I mean absolutely petrified to talk to people.  I break out in sweats and my heart pounds along with shortness of breath anytime I'm out in any social situation, and honestly even when I'm at home thinking about having to go out again sometimes it'll happen. I am well spoken and knowledgeable about many things, I've traveled the country many times and I never use to be this way.   I thought everybody else was crazy and I could handle 10 joints a day with no repercussions, boy what a dumbass I was.  About 2 years ago when I got caught by the DEA for running hundreds of pounds across the country.  I got lucky and they let me go and my dumbass still didn't quit because I'm one of the most stubborn people you'll meet.  I thought weed was the answer to it all, when all along it's been the most contributing factor to my anxiety, relationship problems, and constant agitation toward everything and everybody who doesn't agree with my ""way of life"".   I started smoking when I was 18, I haven't quit since then except for about maybe a couple months all added up because I moved and couldn't find any around.  And wouldn't you know I moved cause I was running from the cops because I stole a credit card cause I was broke from buying so much weed.  Out of pure laziness and thinking there was no way weed could do this to me I never stopped and wouldn't stop even if you paid me too.   I am confident now my mind is right to start this journey of quitting for good and I feel this strategy is going to work for me.  Honestly I find TV is not immersive enough to keep me occupied and not think about smoking, hopefully I can kick it for good this time with some ambition and pure will to be successful.

This post is a recognition of these issues I am running into, and as a result, I pushed myself to get back into exercising yesterday, and will do so again today.

Backstory: I'm currently attempting to stop for the x-time. My bf and I have been big Mary Jane fans for the last 7 years...

To be honest I've never been a huge fan of weed... but when I met my bf he was known by his friends as the 'smoker/pothead' of the group. At first I was very much against smoking, but weed seemed so important for my bf (although he used way less at the beginning of our relationship). 

After a few years together we moved to the Netherlands and got ourselves a nice apartment. As it is very easy to get weed in the NLs he started to ask to try it together. At first I refused as it was against my principals, but I didn't want him to have to change for me. So we agreed that if he wanted to do it himself he could and should, but I would still stay away. However, due to stress at uni and being in another country and not knowing a lot of people I started to feel stressed and down. My bf said that weed could help with the anxiety and just make me forget about the day, so I tried it... It started out innocent, just doing it once a month or every 2 weeks when we had spare time, but before we knew it, it escalated quickly to chilling on the couch (almost) every night. We had our break-moments where we didn't smoke for a couple of weeks when we had exams or we went on holiday, but we always started doing it again.... 

Than I got pregnant and I stopped. Happy days!  Fast forward a year or so and we started doing it again... oh why didn't I just persist :( I couldn't deal with the stress from being a new mom, the constant worrying that something is going to happen to our kid (anxiety is a real bitch) so I went to the one thing I knew would get my mind off of things. Our daughter is now 2,5 yo and we've been 'chilling' almost every night for the past 2 years.... I've tried to stop several times before but I think my mindset was wrong. I was convinced that I could cut down the smoking to once every few weeks, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way for me. 

I realized I could never have a healthy relationship with any substance be it alcohol, smoking or drugs. It's just not in my nature, i'm too greedy for the easy way outs. But it's something I can work on. I'm just so done being 'possessed' by weed (and alcohol too for that matter). The timing this time is also better than ever. I started seeing a therapist for my depression and anxiety and for the first time I want to feel. I don't want to be numbed. I want to get better, not just for a couple of weeks/moths, but forever. So yeah, the poems helps me to remind myself of how I never want to feel again, and it helps me one day at a time.

I love the stuff, it‚Äôs great, and it really eases my stomach when I have flare ups. (My flare ups due to crohn‚Äôs are never too terrible since I started humira, but weed sure helps). My friends and I all enjoy it together, my girlfriend and I enjoy it together, but it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve gone any amount of time without smoking. It makes me worried for my future with all of the drug testing for employment.  I‚Äôm going to school for mechanical engineering, and I personally thing drug testing for weed is quite ridiculous, but, I‚Äôve been thinking about going for an internship at NASA, and I don‚Äôt want a drug test to get in the way of that or other career opportunities. I don‚Äôt want to wait too long to stop smoking, because I procrastinate like none other, and have to resort to using a synthetic urine, or end up finding out it‚Äôs a hair test, in which case I‚Äôm probably screwed anyways. Besides this reason of drug testing, I just want to improve myself as a person. I met my girlfriend about two months ago. And she‚Äôs clearly made for me. I won‚Äôt go too into detail, (and she smokes like I do too) but she‚Äôs incredible. She‚Äôs so crafty, and so artistic, so responsible, so neat and clean, has such a great personality, is wild and fun, and she just seems to be good at everything she does. I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll get bored of me. So worried. Even before I met her, I‚Äôve known I should cut back on the smoking, (I‚Äôll be honest I never want to quit, but I should cut back, and I may NEED to quit to ensure career security) but I just don‚Äôt want her to get bored of me. Moreso, she just told me tonight that she‚Äôs gotten so bored of her past boyfriends after about 4 months.  It‚Äôs been two for us, and when she told me this, she said it doesn‚Äôt feel that way with me, and I believe her, but maybe that‚Äôs just because I need to for my own sanity. (Whoever is reading this, I need you to understand that she very well may be the single best thing that will ever happen in my life, and that is truly how I feel.) we really do seem made for each other, and we have all the same interests and similar personalities and we could easily live a very happy and exciting life together. She‚Äôs just so outgoing. And so creative. And so many other things but She‚Äôs honestly a GREAT representation of who I want to be. She‚Äôs created so much. For example, all of the decor in her apt. Most of the furnishings as well, she‚Äôs made plenty of arts and crafts that are all amazing, she makes all sorts of little things and I love it. I wish I was more that way, the last thing I made was a flower and two little anchors at my old welding job 2 years ago, and i haven‚Äôt made much other than that. I digress, but I just want to be the best self that I can be, and I know I at least need to cut back if I am going to do that.  I sleep in late (as late as I can, if I don‚Äôt have any plans, I could sleep until 2-3 pretty easily, but typically I wake up at 11ish, I really don‚Äôt have a good sleep schedule AT ALL, so maybe I should just fix that first, but, I‚Äôm always behind in my classes and in life in general, and I don‚Äôt think the weed always helps. (although I‚Äôm getting all A‚Äôs this semester, I used to work and go to school and I‚Äôd get by in terms of my grades, but this semester I decided to focus solely on school, partly because I just don‚Äôt want to work lol.

I essentially couldn't smoke anymore even if I wanted to. I suffer from DPDR and general anxiety, and *any* cannabis productsat all triggers problems.

And no, it's definitely not just a placebo thing. Even drinking alcohol causes the same problems. 

Therefore I don't drink a single drop of alcohol, or use anything cannabis related. 

My problem is, I desperately *want* to smoke. I miss regular weed, or any cannabis product for that matter. However I can't use anything cannabis related due to the aforementioned problems. It makes me jealous because for awhile I really wanted weed to be legal so I could buy from dispensaries, grow my own, etc. But one bad weed trip changed everything, and I doubt I'll ever be able to go back to it.

All this makes me feel like I have zero outlet in life. Yes, I know drugs and alcohol shouldn't be an outlet, but let's be realistic, it's nice to kick back *every once in awhile* and have a beer or two, or a hit or two of weed, or smoke some hempflower, anything to just get a small buzz and relax.

Progress is not linear, when I quit the first time I thought it was solely for health reasons. Then I relapsed and I realized how non functional on weed I really am. The little ground I gained in the 80 days I first spent sober quickly evaporated. My health sucked but it's not just that, my entire life fell apart when I smoked again. My house was a pit, I was boring to others, my grades plummeted, I didn't treat my cats right, I couldn't date. It was only once I quit that I truly felt the consequences of my actions, which was incredibly painful.

I'm grateful for that pain however because without it I would have never realized how damaging weed truly is to me. I'm still messed up, and I will be dealing with the consequences of my addiction for perhaps years, but I feel so much better now that I have given my sober self another chance. 

I've been struggling with nightmares, it's a stress dream or a social failure dream every night. I wake up relieved that this is reality. Somedays I feel exhausted and sad. But it is so much better than feeling nothing at all.

Nowadays I'd maybe take a hit if offered but the desire for it just isn't there anymore. It makes me awkward and quiet. 

Well, a coworker offered me a little edible gummy, I said thanks and just saved it for later. I decided to take it one day when I went down to the beach by myself, thought it might be a nice way to really chill out on the sand and watch the waves. 

What was supposed to be a relaxed afternoon hanging out with myself was completely ruined. I was anxious, overthinking, and paranoid about things I normally never thought about. I had a moment of realization when I realized that weed just took my nice day away from me. 

I can't really explain it but I thought of weed as being this barrier I had placed between me and myself. I found myself thinking ""it's okay babe, it's just weed, you'll be feeling normal again soon"".  I just kept thinking, why did I do this to myself?

It shifted my focus away from the waves and the sand and the music to my feelings of anxiety, my fast heart rate, and the intrusive thoughts I was having.

I've been lurking here since Sunday and finally got the cajones to post up this message. I've messed up royally this weekend. I'm 36/M and have been consuming cannabis in one form or another for almost 17 years now. I've had gaps of 3-5 months over the course of last 3 years but I'm pretty much an everyday smoker for the overwhelming majority of my experience. I had always intended to use these gaps as a way to take a break and come back as a ""Casual smoker"" - which never ended up happening because it would quickly snowball into a daily thing after the initial first week. 

Fast forward to 2020 - there were rare pockets of time where I didn't smoke but the last three months has been regular use about 4-6 time a week. The days that I didn't smoke were the days that I would visit my Dad and the family.

This Easter weekend was meant to be special. The weather was fantastic and my Dad invited a buddy of his and his wife as well as my wife and I for dinner.  This was the first time I was meeting any of his friends after a really long time since we're working on mending our relationship after some really ugly family drama over the last decade.

What happened this weekend? Keep in mind, I've never been to my Dad's place high and tend to always enjoy my cannabis indoors at my own place. But this weekend, I thought it was a good idea to randomly consume a 100mg THC-infused drink (that I had been saving up for a special occasion) but ended up having it right before my Dad's dinner party with his friends.

I haven't been high to a party since my 20's with other like-minded folks close to my age at that time. This was different. Everyone involved with at least 30 years older than me and I showed up completely out my mind! I was visibly very inebriated and everyone knew it! I was fooling nobody except for myself. My wife was in a panic and urged my to go upstairs and sleep it off. 

I thought I was fine... I clearly wasn't....

My brother has always been the wild one in the family but that day I appeared to be crazy and out there.

I ended up being *that guy* at the party that shows up drunk, loud, obnoxious, and arrogant and ruins everyone's experience at the party.

I've literally embarrassed my dad, my wife, myself and have let everyone down. The guilt has been weighing heavy on me and I can't help but replay events of that night in my head every couple hours. 

I'm really grateful to have found this subreddit! You guys are giving me plenty of motivation to turn my life around. I've cutting all cannabis from my life and vowing never to return to this again! 

I'm Day 3 today and already experiencing slight headaches which I attribute to the psychological effects of stopping cold turkey. I also understand the first month is the toughest but I have to do this - for myself and for my family.

in order for me to commit to sobriety, i felt like i had to end all of these friendships because i felt like our only foundation was smoking weed together. i felt a bit mean thinking about how maybe i only used them to enable my love for living the high life and how maybe i didn't even like them....so i can't be upset that they may feel the same way about me.

still i can't shake this feeling of guilt and nostalgia because i have yet to find a more supportive group of friends. this seems like a combination of covid and clear sober thinking but I'm posting in hopes of talking to other people who had to cut off friends in order to move forward.

as i type this, i also am being hard on myself for not having better communication skills and explaining to them i don't want to be around them (i never felt like i could overcome social pressure) but now i feel like hindsight is twenty twenty and i am able to better communicate why i am sober and better able to say no in social settings.

i hope someone resonates with this experience because i just need to get this off my chest so i can keep moving forward and understand why i made the choices i did and think more about how i can communicate without feeling like i am hurting or abandoning people.",7,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8965249061584473}"

2021-04-06 19:19:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mloo01/i_thought_weed_helped_with_pms_but_it_made_mine/,"I thought weed helped with PMS, but it made mine worse","TLDR: EXERCISE!! Whether you PMS or not. It will help you stay quit and improve your life in other ways you might not even imagine. If you're interested in my journey of trying to manage rage/depression/PMS, read on (I just focus on the emotionality of PMS, nothing graphic, so it might be relevant to cisgender men as well).

I was wondering why my PMS was seemingly getting worse over the past few years. Mainly the emotional aspect. About 5 days prior to getting my period, this wave of depression and irritability would consume me. Weed would calm me down from a rage, and bring me up from depression, but only in that moment. Over the years it elongated to 7-8 days beforehand, and the physical symptoms got worse too. I actually even had 1.5 years abstinent from weed, and the symptoms were still there, except I didn't have something to break me out of a mood swing, so I would just feel horrible for a week straight, sometimes even 2 weeks if it was an especially stressful month.

I have now figured out the cause: lack of exercise. This is the first month where my symptoms were near zero (until 12 hours before the first day). And the only explanation is that, while I've been exercising a lot to combat withdrawal from and cravings for weed, it's also helped to minimize my PMS. It just seems to obvious now, and I can't believe I didn't see this. Weed made me lazier, and the laziness made my emotions hard to manage, which made my PMS hard to manage. The timeline just adds up.

I used to be very active as a kid and most of college. When I graduated 3 years ago, I pretty much stopped exercising altogether. I did engage in partner dancing, but I stopped doing it regularly after graduating and settling down into a relationship. That's when I stopped smoking & drinking. After 1.5 years of abstinence, and leaving my relationship, I started experimenting back with cannabis (and alcohol) use. I danced a lot, then, so I was truly happy for like 6 months and was managing my life and usage very well. I could wait until the end of the work day to smoke once or twice, and I could drink 2 or 3 drinks on the weekends while dancing and not need to smoke at all on dancing days. Then the quarantine hit, and my anxiety was through the roof. I didn't need to hold off on smoking because I could work from home, and dance was cancelled for who knew how long at that point... so I started self-medicating, as y'all know.

I've tried to quit many times since like July of last year, and even got a month here and two months there. But the PMS always caused a reason to get high. And when i came down from my high, the feeling of absolute garbage was still there, and the depression would be worse because I would reflect on my bad behavior while high and beat myself up. I couldn't even enjoy my high, and I felt like I needed it just to not lose my shit 1/3 of the month. Well I gave quitting another try, and was nervous that I was doing it so close to PMS, because I wanted to at least be out of withdrawal territory before the emotional rollercoaster began. I was fully expecting to be raging and crying all weekend, but I felt great until that 12 hours before. I just couldn't believe I gained like 6 extra good days this month just by being more active, on top of all the other benefits exercise has given me, including reduced anxiety and increased confidence.

So start exercising, if you're not already! Find an activity you like doing or have been interested in trying. Don't just do boring workouts (unless you like them) otherwise you won't do them. If it feels like a chore, you will eventually find an excuse to not do it.

I bought some classes from a yoga studio, and (thanks to COVID) there's limited spots in each class and you have to sign up online beforehand. That keeps me accountable to actually COME to the classes, because I already pre-paid for them and am taking up a limited spot. And I made sure to buy a set amount of classes rather than the unlimited membership, so that each one counts. What activities have y'all been doing to stay sane and confident in your decision to abstain from weed?",9,"{'quarantine': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976982474327087}"

So I see it as me just getting back on the sober train, so to speak.

I know from previous experience that it takes me about 6 months to feel close to normal. For me that means reduced anxiety, manageable depression, no more paranoia, and no more insomnia. This time has been no different, and for the majority of these past 5 months it‚Äôs been an uphill battle.

I know I self-medicate with weed to help with my social anxiety and lack of motivation. For some reason, when I‚Äôm high I get motivated to go out and be social, or do work. But during my previous quits, I didn‚Äôt let my social anxiety or amotivation affect me too much.

This time around, I‚Äôm just so tired. I can‚Äôt seem to find the motivation to get my life together. I‚Äôm really bad at answering my phone and getting back to friends. I think it‚Äôs a mix of the pandemic, being home all the time, and just the multiple attempts at quitting.

I‚Äôm also realizing that I‚Äôm not satisfied with my career and life situation. I think that‚Äôs the reason for my lingering depression and insomnia. I‚Äôm at the point where I realize when withdrawal ends and real life begins. I guess I‚Äôm able to see it clearly without the weed.

Doing creative work sober is such an alien feeling. Although I have a hunch it will lead to better work, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs motivating me to quit in the first place, I‚Äôm afraid of it because it‚Äôs unknown. 

I first posted on here nearly a year ago. Was in ‚Äúquitting mode‚Äù some times, and ‚Äúfuck it mode‚Äù other times. 2 months ago I started trying moderation.

Silver Lining:
I told myself to allow the weed to run out, it did 5 days ago. It‚Äôs the reason I got this far, I think. This is my best streak since June 2020. There will never be a good time to quit. So my final month of university is as good a time as ever. Just 30 days. If I can make it to 30 days, then I‚Äôll believe I don‚Äôt need weed to be creative, interesting, happy...etc.

I‚Äôve spent exactly 7 days without weed after being a regular stoner for 6 years straight. (Cheers to me!) Here are the changes I‚Äôm feeling:

1. Dreams are back! Wuhu! I knew this one would happen but generally enjoying waking with up all sorts of whack stories my subconscious brain is cooking.

2. I‚Äôm feeling clarity. I was becoming a person who would not have a clear answer to simple questions like weekend plans, or just life decisions. Even grocery shopping! Always felt a ‚Äúgrey-ness‚Äù but now I‚Äôve noticed I can say no more and have quick replies to decisions that would really take my time. Overall improvement in communication.

3. I have more time. I feel like my days have become longer. After a long day of work and being on the screen... I still have the capacity to read a book or do something else before I go to bed. This feels very nice. 

4. I feel younger. I always joked about how my actual age is 40 something even though I‚Äôm 24, cause of some other health issues and such, which aren‚Äôt related to weed. But now I feel easily about 30 yo. (Slight win? Haha) 

5. My hygiene has improved. Since I‚Äôm generally more alert and active, my room is actually more organised and I‚Äôm taking regular showers etc. Just feeling cleaner in general. Internally and externally. 

6. Anxiety has gone down. Towards the end, I would tell myself that I smoke for my anxiety but really I was just making excuses to keep smoking. Now that I‚Äôve quit, my general sense of self worth has improved, anxiety has reduced and even the depressive moods. I feel mentally stronger! 

7. Lastly, I feel really strong to love myself more than I love the plant. That‚Äôs the lesson I‚Äôm taking with me. Never love something more than you love yourself. And this feels like the biggest act of self love I‚Äôve done in a while. I think my body is genuinely thanking me. I legit look at the mirror and smile at myself. I have a more positive inner dialogue with myself. 

Another thing which maaaaybe is a byproduct of quitting weed..my hair loss has reduced? I have PCOS so my hair has been thinning out since I was 16 but lately it feels like it‚Äôs not as bad. Maybe it‚Äôs just the positive outlook, but hey! I‚Äôll take it. 

Thank for reading the whole post. I‚Äôm definitely still a lover of the herb. But I‚Äôm so happy to part ways for a while. Hopefully a few years! And then maybe I introduce weed with a changed dynamic. But for now I‚Äôm feeling positive about this change and surprisingly, I don‚Äôt have any severe withdrawals except just a sudden mood to roll a joint... but it passes. 

If you‚Äôre planning to quit or struggling to keep it at bay, I hope this gives you some motivation! I‚Äôm still fresh into the sober life but imma stay a while! ;)",42,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9312017560005188}"

When I was living out in farmland it was easy for me to get past ""fuck it"" moments simply because it would be an hour and a half at least to get weed and come back. Quitting for a couple of weeks back then was easier, because the evening ""fuck it"" was curved by distance.

Don't make the same mistake I did.","So after 6 months of, in hindsight, very good progress, I threw it away for several hours of blazing over the Easter weekend.

Bit of context, gave up weed and tobacco 6 months ago,  cold turkey. Massively upped my fitness/running/workouts and my diet improved significantly. Felt healthy and energetic for the first time in my life really.

Work has been unbelievably shit recently and knowing that I had a about 10 days off until I was back in, my old ways took over and I saw this length of a time as an opportunity for a blowout. I picked up a small amount of weak weed (thai, not skunk not that it matters hugely) and smoked it over the course of the Easter weekend.

My god. How NOT worth it was that. All I felt was the blanket pulling over my eyes again, more sleepy, more mindless binge watching of random shit on YouTube. My eyes felt sooo heavy and I missed my wide-eyed sober face almost immediately. I played video games for the first time since I'd last been stoned. I just felt anxious, disappointed and scared of potentially falling back down that shitty path again.

I have to try and laugh at what a stupid mistake that was from me, because otherwise I just feel angry for throwing away all that progress. I know that 6 months of progress isn't reversed by a few days of smoking weed, but there's a disappointment that I was so bored that I made a poor decision.

Anyway, I finished the weed last night and have thrown away all the accoutrements. Have done a big workout today, am about to go for a run. I'm back on the sobriety train again with no intention of getting back off it.

For anyone in a similar position, please don't let boredom drive you to make such a poor decision. You must consider the pros and cons of such decisions. I chose to taint half a year of great progress in exchange for several hours of 'fun'. Was it worth it? Obviously not. Don't try and rationalise these terrible decisions with anything like, ""I deserve this"" or consider it as a reward/celebration. Everyones different, but for me all I got was an anxiety-inducing, motivation-sapping, slap in the face. Are those the hallmarks of a reward or worthwhile celebration? Fuck no!

I first smoked at 14, and by 16-17 I was a daily user. I'm 29 now, and for the past year or so (maybe longer), I've noticed that I don't even really enjoy smoking weed anymore.

I don't really get high, I just get into an ""altered state"", most of the time it just elevates my heart rate and gives me anxiety. I almost never get the ""good"" high from when I was younger (giggling, silliness, munchies, sleepyness, etc.).

When I look back on my life, I feel intense regret for the amount of weed I've smoked and how much time I wasted just being stoned. I feel it's potentially had a permanent impact on my brains development, and sometimes I wonder how much more I could have achieved if I never got into this habit of daily smoking. Sometimes though, I wonder how my brain development changed because of the daily smoking, and how it will adapt to no smoking at all. I hope I didn't do any permanent ""damage"" by starting at such a young age and constantly getting high during my development years.

I've taken tolerance breaks before (quitting for 1-4 weeks to reduce my tolerance), but I always end up going back and smoking just as much or more than before.

Stopping this time is a fucking nightmare. All my life music has been my biggest love, it's the first thing to get turned on when I get up and the last thing to turn before bed. I've always been active and constantly doing diy to improve where I'm living, repairing items and getting whatever place I'm in comfortable, as well as constantly pottering about rebuilding / riding motorbikes and love reading, watching films and gaming.

I've not long ago bought myself new speakers and amp for my birthday and I'm stunned by the improved sound, I really didn't think it could get any clearer / better but wow it did.

Now the amp has been turned off for the last few weeks, cannot even think about listening to music, cannot read, the bits of bikes are rusting away in the back garden and I really cannot give a fuck about any of it, I cannot even sit down in a comfy chair / settee anymore in the living room, just squat on the half rebuild remains of a pc chair for the brief time I'm there.

Used to get up and have a desire to get on with various things and my days were always busy, now I get up because I cannot stay in bed all day, make a coffee, take my meds, randomly click a few sites to pass a bit of time with my coffee and then instead of getting on with everything as I used to, there's nothing at all that has any interest or desire to do, so I end up back in bed trying to sleep as it cuts down on the time I simply want to kill myself, get up later for the 2nd dose of meds and back to bed again, it's either that or stare at the walls thinking and hating myself even more.

I have mental health issues of bipolar 2 and avpd and this is like the worst of them all piled on at once, but with no sign of ever ending.

My diet hasn't changed it's basically the same as it has been for around 50 years.

Tried the ""forcing myself to do things"" which now makes me feel even worse and doesn't help in the slightest. Due to mental health my self care / hygiene always has odd times of being lacking (showering etc), but now I cannot even change my clothes for clean ones or change the bedding, let alone anything else, just as well I live alone.

Money is also a huge issue. I spend a ridiculous amount of money on weed when I should be saving it for things I need. It‚Äôs just when I get bored or stressed, I turn to weed. 

I really need help. I don‚Äôt know where to start but I do know that I need to at least smoke a lot less than I do now. I miss when I didn‚Äôt smoke much and I was healthy, had a better memory, was better with money, and more focused in school. Should I quit cold turkey?

I reached Day 40 yesterday and with it came a crazy epiphany. I spent the last few weeks feeling sluggish, demotivated - I tried to pull through with exercise and meditation. I kept wondering when I was going to feel better. Once I quit smoking weed, that bitch of an Inner Critic just got louder and louder. Like wow, who is this bitch and why is she so hard on me? She was always around of course, but weed managed to shut her up. Now that I'm not smoking, she is back with a vengeance and much louder and way more 'judgier'. 

I had a hard time concentrating at work (I WFH'd yesterday) and I thought fuck this, I will exercise after work and at least I would have done one thing right today. So I turned on 'Fast Walking' by Leslie Sansone, this YouTube series that I've been using to exercise with. She's amazing by the way, very encouraging and and peppy - exactly what I needed after not being able to focus all day. 

And while I was following along and listening to her words, it was as if the clouds had cleared. I felt a brief moment of pure contentment and happiness. Something I was trying to figure out came to me, in a moment of clarity and I broke down crying. I realised that this was the feeling I was chasing all along, while I spent all those years smoking up. 

**It's not about chasing the high, it's about chasing that feeling of being peace with oneself.** All I really wanted was to be able to be comfortable in my own skin - to love and treasure myself and not be a bitch to myself like my Inner Critic. Being high will never give me the contentment that I've been seeking all long. 

Even though it was a fleeting moment, and the Inner Critic came back after that, it made me realise that the struggle IS worth it. 

I just know that if I persevere and keep going, I will have many more moments of clarity. I will be able to focus again. I will be creative again and I will be at peace with myself. It just takes time. Being kind to yourself I think is very, very hard, but that's exactly what we need to be. 

Be patient and kind with yourself and I promise you, things will get better. If you can't work that day, it's okay. If what you need is to stay in bed on the weekend even though you said you would clean your car/house, it's okay. We are going through an intense period of transition, the worse thing to do is to be harsh with ourselves. This is not a free pass to slack off completely of course, but if you can't be kind to yourself during this time, it will be easier to go back to old habits. 

Sorry this was longer than intended, but thanks for reading. Needed to get that out of my system. If you can do one thing for yourself today - Be Kind. Be your own best friend. Everything else will fall into place. And when you're struggling, come back to this sub, because you have a whole forum of people waiting to give you encouragement! I know I will.

But I've been doing something a bit different this time round. I've been soooo lazy. This weekend I basically played the sims for like 12 hours a day. Today I did a grand total of 6 minutes of yoga. I've been eating chocolate cake and biscuits because easter.

This is very different from how I usually try to quit. I usually go for the 'start exercising, watch the diet, do half a dozen hobbies so you feel productive at the end of the day' strain of quitting. Works for some. Hasn't worked for very long for me.

See, I'm lazy. I'm a lazy bastard. Im tired of pretending I'm not. I dont wanna do something unless I wanna do it. And I'm not gonna force myself. 

And that's the benefit I'm seeing with this new lazy quitting. I'm not forcing myself to stay sober. Literally the only time I thought about a substance today was when I almost tripped over an empty bottle (it was my mums birthday last week and I didnt have any) and now, writing this post. I didnt even think to check leaves for motivation.

I feel so much more relaxed in myself. I dont feel like I should be doing something productive - I've decided that's not what I want. Not that I want to be unproductive all the time, but that I never want to feel like I *should* do something. I've given myself permission to just be whoever I am right now, lazy warts and all. And this feels sustainable. This feels like just being myself for the rest of my life. Nothing better, nothing worse. And if I slip up, I'll do that as myself too, and not as someone who *should* be better. 

Sorry this turned into an essay, I kinda just wanted to ramble. 

But yeah, TLDR: previous quitting attempts were based off of an idea that I should be better/fitter/less of a fuck up. Now I'm just happy to be the fuck up I am. And that's kinda taken the bullets out of weed's gun.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9130216240882874}"

I had made several attempts to quit with relapse coming within a week or so, and did not know what to do. When I finally quit for the last time (hopefully the last) I had severe shoulder and back pain and anxiety that was to the roof, and it only made me more and more upset about quitting and I figured I would relapse very soon. I kept with it, and after 2 weeks or so, the anxiety began to fade and hobbies and interests that I had forgotten about for years slowly started to take form. I used to be big into reading and playing video games, but for over 2 years my gaming PC set in the corner of my room turned off and my bookcase was never even glanced at due to my addiction. I can proudly say that my personality and interests have recovered as a whole, and with time, I have become a much better person then the one I was six months ago.

Every time I smoke, I do it expecting it to ease my anxiety, even though that rational voice in my head knows it will only make it worse, yet I keep going back to it expecting something to be different (even though I know it won't be, it's just self induced torment at this point). Not only does it make my anxiety worse, but it has also completely screwed my serotonin, dopamine, and general enjoyment of life. Everything in reality seems so much more dull than it actually is, and I find trouble enjoying normal activities.

I feel like my mind has become sluggish - when I was younger my mind would race - I feel like this is one of the reasons I got into smoking in the first place.

I feel like I built up some sort of positive relation with it and connected it to me feeling better in times when I feel down / angry as a coping mechanism.

I‚Äôm now day 1 and looking some advice on how you guys would go about it? Ive been thinking trying to do a ritual every evening such as meditation üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è to try keep my mind off it.

1. I'm dreaming every single night. It's amazing. It's like I have a second life.
2. It's really nice to not have to worry about how the apartment smells anymore
3. I've been told I'm way mentally quicker now, which leads to funnier and faster jokes, more interesting conversational contributions and a boost of confidence
4. My SO says my eyes are brighter, probably because they're not half lidded with dope
5. Coffee hits me way harder now for some reason, I can't drink a full mug like I used to before or I get too wired. Maybe it's because I'm naturally more awake now?
6. A month in I was really, really concerned about my creativity not coming back (I'm an artist). What I learned was that it was because my inner critic wasn't silenced by weed anymore-- I was much more self aware of my art and there was a period of time where that scared me because I kept noticing mistakes and wanting to change things. Now my fire is fully back and guess what? I'm making way better art because I'm thinking critically as I go.
7. I remember the movies I watch now. And I'm rewatching ones I've ""seen"" and it's like seeing them for the first time
8. If something comes up that needs to be done (phone calls, etc) I just do it then, because I don't have to sober up or fight the anxiety of ""am i too high to handle this?""
9. My productivity after work has skyrocketed. I feel like doing hobbies now instead of just existing, melting into a chair. My output of personal art has been fantastic and super satisfying
10. I keep coming back to the thought of ""wow, it was all worth it. All the pain and emotion and struggle to get here. I'm so glad I made the leap.""

I always embraced that it's non-addictive, and chemically speaking it isn't (not like nicotine or opioids at least) but this is testing my willpower like nothing else has except *maybe* muscling through some exceptionally challenging and uninteresting college courses. 

It's fucking brutal for the first week in fact- good sleep has a huge impact on my overall health and having to lay awake at night wishing I could step out onto my porch with a bowl of kush to ease me to sleep makes it all the worse. Relearning hunger cues without the munchies, clamminess, and the irritability- oh christ the irritability, the cycle of getting so pissed off over every minor inconvenience and then berating myself for overreacting over and over and over again made me feel like a teenager all over again. Stewing in negative emotions without being able to articulate why I feel that way is one of my least favorite feelings.

And having to go to work and sell this stuff? Pretend like I'm still just as jazzed about it, that 'oh yeah, I tried the new batch of Astral Ape that came in, it's some fire shit dude. Definitely worth picking up an eighth!' lying through my teeth I have to do 5 days a week? That's just the cherry on top. I am surrounded by chronic smokers daily and expected to be yet another one of them so I have some depth of knowledge for my customers. 



And for all of the shittiness, it's still better than where I was. I was listless, bored and boring. I filled whatever time I had with taking dabs ad inifinitum and doing whatever low-hanging fruit of an activity I could engage in (guess how many had any long-term benefit to me?). My coughs sounded horrendous, I was fatigued, my sex life with my partner was suffering, my sinuses would be bloody every morning.  I blew more money than I care to admit on pot, even with an employee discount.

I'm reminded often that there's a wide spectrum of use, and where I'm healthiest is firmly at the extreme- not at all. I've had my fun with this, and hopefully sooner rather than later I'll get a new job that doesn't surround me with a habit I can't, and don't want to, engage with anymore.

2021-04-05 11:47:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mknqm3/good_things_take_time/,Good Things Take Time,"Weed was a great crutch during college. Stressed about homework? Smoke. Relationship problems? Smoke. Nice day to chill outside? Smoke. All the while, I was passing classes and getting good grades, which I took to mean that I was pretty much immune to the bad effects. I even took it to mean that it made me *better* at my subject, like I could ""think differently"" or ""zone in"" and do some incredible work.

When the real world hit, I wasn't ready at all, and even though I had good grades, it turns out real life is a lot more than getting the right answers on some homework questions. When I was alone (or with other stoner friends) smoking, my peers were at ""lame"" (read: sober) events, making real friends and career connections, or building interesting hobbies that would engage them.

I kept thinking that I just have to get that ""zone in"" back. Smoke, research some stuff online, hit paydirt with some new big idea that would make me the next Elon Musk or whoever. I was working in web design at the time, but my personal ideas never got off the ground: I'd write a bit of code, take a hit to up my creativity, and end up on Reddit or wherever instead of writing code. My searching for the ""big idea"" turned into searching in the rabbithole of conspiracy and tabloid-politics online. 

Anyway, long-story short, money ran out, relationship was over, and I wasn't getting any more work from my job. I guess you'd call that rock-bottom. This whole time I kept telling myself ""I'll stop smoking weed if it is going to negatively affect my life/career."" Well, I guess I got that message about 3 years too late, but I finally gave it up. I worked some jobs that I thought were ""beneath"" me: hard work at odd hours with rough people. It actually felt good though, because I was out in the world every day, and making my living.

What I learned in that time is the power of working something every day. Looking back, this seems so stupid, but I really think that I believed if I just got high enough and strummed around on a guitar, that I'd learn something. Or if I got my ""creative side"" going and started writing code, that I'd have the next Facebook on my hands. All these people that I thought just had a ""natural ability"" at something, they're up every day practicing, honing, and improving.

Instead of giving up when it got hard or boring, I showed up to my job every day and improved. When that got noticed, I got a promotion to a completely different, challenging position. I found that I really liked that field of work, and decided to go back to school in it, except this time, I'd hit the gym after class instead of going straight home to smoke, and I kept my job part-time. Many days I didn't have one spare moment.

During my degree, I got pulled aside by a professor who asked me (almost in a criticizing tone) why I wasn't taking a graduate degree. Well, he convinced me to take the graduate class, and helped me get funding so that I could work on research and get my degree paid for. Now I'm someplace I honestly though I'd never be: writing the first words of my PhD thesis.

Weed is the ultimate instant gratification. It doesn't always even feel good, but it at least feels different, and it's *fast.* When you want to change something in your life, it's so quick to smoke up, versus creating actual, real changes.

The actual real changes take time. They don't hit you in the side of the head like strong bud, but they also last way longer. Every really positive change in my life happened when I showed up, worked it, and kept working day after day. And guess what? I still feel like shit some days. Not from weed or anything, but just because that's part of life. Still though, I have to keep showing up, because I know that long-term, it keeps getting better.",31,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9954954385757446}"

And as typical with weed, I kicked back and relaxed all my troubles away - except I didn‚Äôt. I binged on food again and was constantly paranoid and annoyed while high. When I was sober, I was constantly waiting to get high. I was miserable and unhappy whether high or sober.

My standard for what counts as work instantly diminished the morning after my high. I can‚Äôt afford to live that way.

It was until I got high last night where I had a moment of clarity and saw the harm I was doing to myself. I saw the obese wasteful person I am set to become on the substance. So I promised myself to quit the next morning with all my life.

Therefore, I threw my weed, my pipe and my lighter away today morning. And I am back to continuing my journey.

I have been a many times daily smoker since about 18. I quit in september for two months, but then I went on vacation and picked it up again when I hung out with my old friends. Now I have been about 48 hours without smoking, and I am starting to really suffer.


My biggest problem is that I am better at functioning with weed, I have OCD, a mood disorder, and PTSD, and weed has helped me tremendously with my episodes. So it has really been my medication. But I am also a singer, and every time I smoke I cant help but imagine myself with a hole in my throat from emphysema thinking ‚Äúwhy didnt I just let it go.‚Äù But I feel like I just cant handle life without weed. I know a lot of people say everything loses its sparkle when you quit, but it seems to me like everything is just SO MUCH. My kids are overwhelming me, cleaning my house is overwhelming me, I cant make my art because all I can do is sit here and think about how bad I feel. I just want to hide and watch tv and cry.


I have never had a problem with being productive while smoking, in fact it has always helped me unless I get way too high. Instead, my anxiety sober is so bad that I tend to just sit there and think endlessly about what I should do, while doing nothing at all. Weed helps me in a lot of ways, I have chronic stomach problems and it helps me eat. I had an eating disorder and weed helped me with that too.


But still, there are so many things I hate about being high. I hate the short term memory loss. I hate the lack of dreams, i usually get a whole night long dream adventure if I‚Äôm not smoking. I hate that it makes me tired, and I hate that it makes me nervous in public (although that has improved a lot with legalization). 


My problem is, all of the pros for quitting, while they are things I really want, seem like nothing in comparison to the anxiety and stress I feel without smoking. It makes me feel like its not worth it. When I actually managed to quit last time (or more like take a break) I was able to find other ways to relieve anxiety, like playing my harp, or singing. But it just feels so far away.


I quit another time, at 20, for about 6 months, and for the first 3 months I was really good because my life was bustling and I was distracted, but then I started drinking, which is even worse than weed imo. So then to quit drinking I bounced back to weed. I know there is a huge mental component to my addiction but I dont know if I can change it. I would love to smoke moderately if I could, but I keep proving to myself that I cant. I am disappointed in myself for misusing my medicine to the point where I cant even gain anything from it anymore.


I‚Äôm a stay at home mom with three young kids, one of which has a lot of mental health problems, and I‚Äôm also trying to release my first EP as a singer/songwriter, so all of my time is spent productively besides about an hour of downtime and sleeping. My life is just so stressful. It feels like an excuse when I say it, but really, even with weed, there have been so many days in the past 5 years that I have broken down in tears because I feel like I just cant push through the hardships anymore. Life is so hard, but I have always had weed. So I just dont know how I am going to quit.


I felt fine the last time I quit, I was happy, I said I didnt need it. Despite all the excuses, I still want to quit. I just wish it werent so damn hard. I wish I could just smoke every weekend or once a month like regular people, or even once a day. It‚Äôs so frustrating, I just want to stop thinking about weed all the time.


I dont really know the point of this post, I guess it‚Äôs just nice to write out my inner dialogue to people who might understand. And posting here is better than going and smoking. I wrote something similar about a year ago but felt like it was stupid, so I didnt post it. But this time I‚Äôm going to.

First of all I'm sorry if this isn't structured in a perfect way. I just try to write down my thoughts atm.
I just discovered this subreddit yesterday night when I couldn't sleep as thoughts were chasing me. I found this app ""Quit weed"" and got inspired again to change something in my life again.

I  did spend the Easter weekend at my parents and decided to leave the weed at my place. So obviously for me as a 23yo who has been smoking for 7 years I knew those feelings of restlessness where I couldn't think of anything else except that I wanted to smoke when the day got to an end. Always feeling uncomfortable and craving for a joint.
I had some addiction problems when I was ~18. Since then it kinda worked out as I did my military service and obviously had to stop for those months. But since last year when Corona started it got worse and worse. It started when I suddenly had to leave my studies in Scotland and had to fly back home where I had to live with my parents again for 2 months (my flat was still being rented to someone else). I think it was at this point when everything started getting worse. I was bored and suddenly living with your parents again leads to tensions. So I smoked more weed again. When I moved back to the city I stuck to it.

Now I tried quitting a couple months ago, more as a break as I wanted to donate blood again. But I failed after a couple days already as I have been strongly struggling with mental health as well as back pain, stress and what I want from life for myself. So I've been starting to implement more healthy routines in my life and quit weed at the same time. So that was just too much I think. I now do a small amount of sports everyday, yoga, exercises, walks etc and some bigger workouts 1-2x per week. And that somehow works by now and makes me feel better in general.

But apart from that I'm often just feeling useless during the day. I'm right before my bachelor thesis now and working part time for a company in my branch but the rest of my day is often just me being apathetic and not really wanting to do anything as everything seems unfun. Even hobbies I really enjoyed before. 

Those times right now really make me struggle. I don't know where to go or what to do. I'm not really happy with where I stand in live right now even though I normally manage everything I do quite well. Everyone always tells me that and that they are impressed by or proud of me. But it never feels like that to me. To me I feel like a looser.
Now my girlfriend moved to Switzerland for an internship a month ago and basically the day she left it got really bad.
I mean I was kinda having the time of my life. Smoking all day, every day. Like 1,5g a day in many many joints and I could just numb myself like that and life was okay. But it wasn't and it isn't. 

I want more from life and especially do something good. I want to work with the people who aren't as lucky as I got to be in Germany. I'm a civil engineer to be and am planning of working in Africa or somewhere else where people are in desperate need of help. But atm everything feels so useless and hopeless. I've got so many things on my mind and can't handle everything at the same time. So weed always really helps me in the moment. But in the long run I guess it makes all my problems worse.

I've been sober from weed for 3 days now but I don't really feel necessarily better. Still got weed at home and would like to smoke a last time today but I mean we all know that's just a lie. I just wasn't ready of stopping so soon again. I always somehow failed controlling my consumption behaviour of weed. I'm the kind of guys who can only give everything or nothing. I fail to implement moderation in my life, in all kinds of things though.

But yesterday I kind of had a really bad day. I was feeling really bad even though I should have felt good. I did collect garbage for 2 hours in a nearby forest, met one of my childhood friends over a beer again and then I watched this new documentary ""Seaspiracy"" and it left me completely shocked and powerless. So afterwards I was laying in bed for hours, thinking about all the shit that's going wrong from my POV. And one of the things was the weed, so I wanted to stop. 

My dream would be to have a healthy relationship with it and just smoke from time to time in special occasions but I tried that so often with phrases like ""only on the weekend"", ""only with friends"", ""okay but at least only on the evening"" and nothing of that ever worked out. I always fall back in my patterns and most of the times I fall deeper than before.
Cannabis is something good and I had great times with it in the past but I think I already finished this game and it's only fishing for something that isn't there anymore. It's not like I feel particulary amazing when I smoked or after I smoked but I always want to smoke. Well I guess that's what you call addiction.

I really hope I can stay strong and make this journey to become a better version of myself and have more energy and fun in my life again. It just feels like to much at the same time right now.
I would like there to be another way than stopping completely but I guess there isn't.

Anyways thanks for coming to my TED Talk. I don't know if anyone is going to read this but it for sure helped me to write those thoughts down even if they are a bit random and just a small insight of what is going through my head right now.


If anyone just slightly understands how I feel and wants to share his experience or give me some advice, you are more than welcome. And if not that's okay too.

Just wanted to let this out and let you know.

Have a wonderful day ‚ù§Ô∏è

We were sitting in my car talking and having kind of a heart to heart with our other friend because he‚Äôs been going through a lot. While we were talking my best friend started hitting his vape and for a second I thought about asking for a hit. But as soon as I realized that I just thought ‚Äúask for a hit‚Äù I stopped and I swear I started busting laughing on the inside. But I am so proud to say that I only thought it but did not put it into action. As we continued talking I was kind of stressed because having a heart to heart can be stressful and I thought ‚Äúdamn I could use a beer‚Äù but again I stopped myself from asking for one and I shoved that thought to myself. 
I am not just quitting weed, but alcohol and nicotine too. It sucks to go through it because my best friend is still smoking very heavily and I think without me to smoke with him he‚Äôs started to smoke more, or maybe I‚Äôm just noticing how much we smoked before I quit because during our conversation with our friend he decided to walk back to our dorm. When my boyfriend and I finally got back to our dorm we walked in and my best friend wasn‚Äôt in there because he was smoking. My boyfriend and I got ready for bed because it was late at this point and my best friend finally walks in and he made himself some food, then went and hit dabs. 

It is very difficult trying to change my ways and be sober because I am still living with my stoner best friend and but I am so glad I am no longer abusing weed like we used to. I just wish my best friend could get the wake up call like I did, unfortunately, I think that because of how he was raised it won‚Äôt be until he faces some serious consequence. Because of this I do not think I can ever be the wake up call for my best friend myself, but I recognize that I can be a good example and I recognize even more now that I can be a leader.

Something that makes us excited to wake up in the morning. Something that gives you a sense of accomplishment and purpose. Something you‚Äôre pursuing that keeps you up at night. Something that makes you think life is too short. Something that makes you WANT to take advantage of this GIFT.

Although as I sit here and write this, as an addict. I have taken advantage of unnatural happiness. My desire is too escape this gift for an artificial sense of enjoyment. I am stuck wanting the want. I have been caught in a trap that I willingly walked in. Throughout my stay in this trap I have made many realizations as we all have. I have replaced things I once enjoyed with a fake and deceptive pleasure that feels impossible to leave behind. 

I can‚Äôt recall seeing a post of things to look forwards to. I could be wrong and I apologize if so, but a fried memory is only one of the few symptoms to our addiction. 

So here it is.
Things to look forwards to.

The ability to have lucid dreams.(really just dreams in general but lucid is sure a bonus)

Manageable Anxiety. 

Replacing laziness with a new and right desires. 

Having REAL things to look forwards to besides a hit to take that edge off.

Less overthinking with action opposed to dwelling and more dwelling.

Will to live

Hopefully dissipate depression 

More meaningful relationships with friends and family.

That ‚Äúhigh‚Äù you get when pursuing something.

Even just to have the interest to pursue something. 

Having my Witt return to me.

My thirst for knowledge. 

Ambition 

To be outgoing once again.

To be able to experience and handle emotions without running and replacing them. 

For time to quit flying by every time I blink. 

To wake up in the morning and not dread the oncoming day. 

To look back and see more than just scattered half meaningless memories through a haze. 

For interactions amongst people to feel less in genuine and more meaningful.

Last but not least.

To find ME. To really learn who I am. Not who I am now, as an addict. 
I will not try and find who I was before becoming dependent because that person is long gone and I know this. I have grown and learned many things since then and I will come out a NEW and BETTER version of who I once was. 

I‚Äôm aware this isn‚Äôt even half of the things to look forwards to because all of these things listed will branch out into many many other things.

So I got pretty sick with bronchitis almost 3 weeks ago, surprisingly enough I decided I was going to stop, because it was hard for me to breathe. 

It's been 2 whole weeks and I've lost 6 lbs without even trying. I've been an every day, multiple bowls in the bong a day smoker for 14 years. All my friends and family have probably rarely seen me sober the entirety of those 14 years, so when I told them that I am 2 weeks clean, they're all pretty shocked.

Why did I stop? Because I had a bad trip in January and it was the slap in the face revealing to me that weed was holding me back. It's the reason I over ate on a daily basis, the reason I would binge and sleep. At my heaviest, I weighed 250, and for my 5 foot 6 inch frame, I looked really heavy. I worked out a ton for years and got down to 160, but I gained 30 lbs due to covid and being locked in the house with nothing to do but smoke and eat and sleep. Now I'm 30, engaged and realizing the mess I've made of my 20s. Numbing/self medicating with weed to cope with my inadequacy was probably the biggest waste of time ever. I would get home, smoke to relax but never did anything. I would lay in bed for the rest of the night. 

I am changing my career, and I realized that I could open myself up to so many more, better paying opportunities is I passed a UA. I hate how in debt I al, living paycheck to paycheck. I also want to have kids soon, so why not prepare and detox myself before all of that? I mean who really wants to start a family in debt?

I‚Äôve been trying to quit for a few months. I was smoking for legitimate pain control, but my tolerance was higher than I cared for and I couldn‚Äôt always tell what was use and what was abuse.

I‚Äôve also got a lot going on physically and emotionally, I‚Äôm on a large cocktail of medication, and some of my symptoms could be chalked up to long term marijuana use (~10 years, ~7 of those years was daily). 

 I started a pain contact with my doctor to transition, with the understanding it was transition, not an immediate switch. 2-3 weeks ago I had forgotten I took a pill and smoked the same amount I used to, even though I‚Äôd been off mmj for about a week. It was... not good. I told my wife I was done. Since then, I‚Äôve smoked 3 times, shortest steak was 1 day and my longest was 9 days. I usually start to struggle at day 5.

So a little over a week ago I was diagnosed with CHS and was forced to quit cold turkey after getting up to about 1 Oz per week of consumption after 13 months in quarantine. Now I've taken T-breaks before with varying lengths and degrees of success, but never before have I had to ""quit"" in the sense of hard abstinence, especially after smoking so much. Usually my withdrawal symptoms, if any, could more or less be summed up as 4-5 days of unmotivated boredom before my body would regulate itself and I'd be back to feeling normal. 

However, this time things are quite different. I feel pretty normal in terms of mood swings and motivation, but lately it's been getting more and more obvious that I have some serious baggage locked up somewhere. I wouldn't call myself depressed, in fact I'd say I'm very optimistic about my future without weed, but lately it feels like every time I get sad/emotional at something it makes me tear up much more easily, and I can feel this weight on my shoulders like something's knocking on the backdoor of my brain. At first I thought it was part of the mood swings/hormone imbalance, but as I felt those level out more each day, this feeling kept gnawing away at me, becoming more and more apparent.

Then it hit me, I haven't cried in a LONG time. Yeah I've shed a tear or two, gotten emotional at times, but I genuinely can't remember the last time I had a real deep cathartic weep. I'm mostly keeping it together until Easter weekend is over and I can get some time alone away from my family, but as soon as I get the chance I just want to let it all out. Whatever this is I've clearly been keeping it bottled up for a while and now that I've identified it, it's become harder to ignore than ever. I don't even know where it's coming from but all I know is that I want it out of me.

Anyway thats all I wanted to say, just wanted to share my experience. It's weird that its only coming up now, and not during any of my breaks before, but I guess that's just the way it is. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø",4,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9901286959648132}"

I now realize how scared I of life I made myself by smoking regularly for over 35 years. 

This morning, I sit overlooking the Pacific Ocean. I could not have made the trip out here to see my son if it weren‚Äôt for quitting. I would have been terrified to rent a car and drive the highways here to see him. 

I can look him in the eyes and know I am a better mother for quitting. 

I had the balls to start a conversation with a stranger this morning and I learned a shit-ton about surfing. I have had the guts  to talk to my neighbors‚Äîmuch to the surprise of them and me. 

I have the nerve to face my past and claim responsibility for my actions. 

Covid drove my smoking to new heights. I started a business when I lost my job that entailed me being home alone doing production for hours on end. This, of course led to smoking countless times per day. Legalization in my State made it oh-so-easy to do. (Not that I ever had any problem finding it before legalization.)

Now I am working on my resume and looking forward to getting back into society. I now look at experiences as  positive in the sense I can help people that may be in the position I was in when I started. 

The doorbell ringing no longer sends me into a tailspin of fear where I stay frozen in my house until they leave. I now answer the door with gusto. 

I have suffered through the crying jags on day four and five and thank goodness  for this site because people told me that part is a symptom of withdrawal. 

Also, it turns out that I have CHS. If it weren‚Äôt for Leaves, I would not have known what that is. I have been too sick to eat and I lost lost five pounds in one week-it is my 35 year weight loss plan! LOL. I don‚Äôt recommend it. Starting to feel better and I‚Äôm able to eat. Of course these shiny  brass balls have added to my weight but in a good way!

I want to say how grateful I am for all of your support and education. I have considered quitting before but never had the nerve to make that leap off the high dive of my addiction. I finally did it and guess what? The water is fine! It‚Äôs awesome here in the the pool of recovery.  Join me. If I can do it, you can too.

I‚Äôm nearly two days down the road to sober. I‚Äôve found when I miss a day I get the same symptoms as I mentioned above.

And when I struggle with my emotions is when I am most likely to relapse. It hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows since I quit this time around, but I can genuinely say that my life is better. I am doing things that are good for me and I am staying /motivated/ to do these things. Yesterday, I made myself go on a run and even stayed outside so I could get 10k steps in. I did some stepwork, I listened to music, I spent time with friends (both virtual and in-person) and it was so, so, so good for me.

One thing that I have to be mindful of in my recovery is that I have to work at this every single day. I know myself well and know that it can only take a second, a moment, a word, a thought, anything and I can go back out and start using again. And I don't want that for myself any more. I have to keep working hard to maintain my recovery because there are SO many things in my life that I want that I won't be able to achieve if I keep using: a stable career, a house of my own, a better, stronger and healthier relationship with my ex who I hurt so deeply with my use, a family. There are so many things that I forgot that I wanted while I was using because all I could think about was getting high.

Not any more. I don't want to get high any more. I don't want to lose myself.  I don't want to lose anything because of my own decisions. If I lose anything beyond my control, that's fine. Loss is a part of life, after all. But I cannot be the one to cause my own downfall any more. I am tired of the self-sabotage.  I am tired of thinking that I don't deserve good in my life. I fucking do, dammit. I deserve a good life. I deserve to LIVE.

This is just a bunch of ramblings. I hope this helps whoever's reading this. I am working to heal three important relationships during recovery: my relationship with myself, my relationship with the person who I believe is the love of my life, and my relationship with my Higher Power. These are relationships I neglected throughout my use for the past 2.5 years. I refuse to  be neglectful again. I want to be intentional and I want to *care*\--something I stop doing when I am picking up again. I refuse to let myself stop giving a shit like that again. I gotta do this for me.

I thought back on all the times I've been irritable with my family because I was a day or two without weed. Or all the times I've not come home to see my parents and sister because of my anxiety or just wanting to get high. All the arguments or angry moments they didnt understand were just the emotions of an addict without a fix. I used weed to hide my emotions daily and it's no surprise that meant I never had to manage them without self medication. 

The harsh reality of weed is all the little decisions it affects. It hurts to look back and think how I wasnt present at all for years. I never though of myself as an addict, but now I accept I am one. Just a sober one.Addiction in all forms ruins us.

 I want to end on a positive and just tell everyone I love them. For all the courage to tell their struggles and the love this community shows every member. Reading these stories is truly the only thing that grounds me in tough moments.

I would appreciate anecdotes, shared experiences, and tips. 

I quit. I don't know how many days or months it's been exactly - between two and three months I think. There was no motivator this time that I haven't had before, when I tried and failed to quit. I think I just met my limit with the abuse of this substance. Not sure why, other than I want to move forward.

I just don't know how. I know I need to practice yoga and meditate again. Doing so before made me happy. But I abused the relationship I have with myself, and with others. And I find it hard to release the guilt from that, which prevents me from moving forward and thriving. 

I covered a lot of important things with my use. I'm afraid to feel those things still. I know I am too hard on myself, and still hate myself for many things I've done, said, etc. I haven't loved myself in years. I want to, again. I need to. For the people around me. I'm tired of limiting the love I have to give, and I feel like I know that starts with the love I have for myself. 

Is it normal to feel such guilt, and lack of love for yourself? Its why I used to begin with, likely. 

This post is the first I've made in my attempt to heal, I think. I'm afraid to share that with others, due to the situation of my employment, so I'm sharing it anonymously here. I'm actively announcing my attempt at self love, but I want support of people who don't have a vested interest in me doing better.

I decided weed was a burden on my life and I quit and have been feeling better for it in every way. My friend whom I havent seen in a while came over this weekend and after getting drunk I smoked and honestly I had a small amount, a few drags, and it was fine. 

Then we smoked the following morning without drinking, and peppered in some js throughout yesterday. Without the buffer of booze I was tossed immediately back into being paranoid to fuck. Am I sitting right? Can I eat food normally? Is my breathing loud? I also even was a bit twitchy from the anxiety. Right now I'm a bit dissociated, my headspace is uncomfortable and my dreams (I had dreams - weird, right?) were a fucking nightmare of anxious-laden nonsense. I won't be smoking again today. I may have 2-3 drags in another 6 months after getting drunk with a friend, but I doubt it. Smoking weed is not something that has to be binary (every day vs no days ever ever ever) but yesterday made me realise how I was literally torturing myself mentally for years, all completely under the guise of the classics: weed is cool, no physical addition, lack of self-identity, etc. I dont know how i kept it up for so long in such extreme denial. It can happen to anyone. 

I guess the point of me writing this was two-fold: one; don't get too hung up on the dates and the numbers of how long you haven't smoked. If that works for you then great, but I feel if I counted everyday as day 74 without smoking, 75, 76 and so on not only would the pressure build but if you ever did smoke again you've failed and are back to 0. That isnt how it works. All this weekend did was reaffirm my initial decision, it wasnt a failure on my part. And two; listen to those hints of paranoia that youre stuffing down. All those small things that you arent acknowledging are a burden when they're happening; start to internalise that they are, in any small way that you can, even if its something like waking up after smoking and telling yourself that when you watched that film with your friends you may have laughed and smiled but you know you were uncomfortable. Focus on the negatives, because weed makes it so easy to ignore they exist when they're happening right under you.

After going on journey of personal development I finally got a education in my 40's and became a Youth Worker . I was still smoking weed and felt like a hypocrite but hay I can live with is I told myself as  I was making a great impact on many of youngsters I worked with.  Driving to shops just over 2 weeks ago  the blue and red lights flash in my revision mirror with yelp of the police siren I knew what was coming. Road side alcohol and drug test. Which I failed.  This was the wake up call i needed. I knew from all studies I have done that weed was not good for my truma based pain, that expressed itself as chronic anxiety and depression that could keep in bed for months at a time. I keep telling myself that weed dulls the pain, little did i realize it actually making things worse untill now.
It was a easy choice for me to stop smoking weed after run with police. As I really love my job and dont want to lose it.I no longer feel like a hypocrite when working with youngsters and my anxiety and depression has all but disappeared.  Yes  the last two weeks have been extremely hard. The frist few days I crying at the drop of a hat, hell my cat made me cry just because he looked sad ( maybe he was missing weed to, how dare I  not consider if cat wanted to stop smoking).
Next came a new type anxiety and depression that not only hurt my brain it also played havoc on my stomach. But with some mindfulness and plant based whole foods this is now starting to pass.
The common side effect which knocked me adout the most, was the dreaming that has been extremely dark, violent and vivid. To deal with this I only allow myself 5 minutes a day to ponder the dreams from  the night before. And  I now put my brain in health space before going to bed. I listen to Alan Watts as I love zen philosophy, the chillstep music is quite relaxing and he has a lovely monotone voice that puts me to sleep.

It's been 1 year since my country's first lockdown and during that lockdown all socialising was done online. All my friends are gamers anyway so it wasn't a huge change. But the discord has become a very big part of our lives. 
I'm autistic. Crowds, even virtual ones cause me massive anxiety. And when I'm talking to people I feel like I'm constantly putting on an act, trying to replicate normal human behaviours, and while I massively enjoy taking to them, it's exhausting. Weed let me not bother with my act, it let me be me and have fun without expending masses of energy to pass as neurotypical. So during lockdown I became a heavy smoker.

I'm several month clean now. I won't lie I'm not remotely ok but I'm hanging in there!
I've noticed that since quitting I'm suggesting we all crack open the vodka and do the same shit we always do but drunk. I cannot stress how much I never drank before this. I would have the occasional fruity cider and get drunk maybe once a year if that. But now I'm trying to get everyone to drink and sometimes if no else fancies drinking I'm the only one drinking. I'm not getting totally smashed. I play support/healer in both the games we mainly play (league of legends and FFXIV) and to be honest they're all lovable reckless idiots only out for the pentakill or ridiculously huge pull, without me saving their asses they'd have no hope. So never drunk enough to let everyone die. Just drunk enough to not have those inhibitions. To not care about being a socially awkward mess and to be able to drop the act.

 My husband said last night he's worried I'm heading towards a problem with alcohol. And I'm worried too. But I haven't found anything else that lets me be comfortable to just exist on the discord as the socially awkward autistic mess I am. We spend a lot of time on the disc which I don't want to change but I have so much more fun when substances are letting me be authentically me. It's not healthy but I can't face going back to putting on my exhausting neurotypical act and my anxiety is too bad to let me just drop the act. 

It feels like I need 3 things; to be substance free, to drop the act and to not have anxiety, but I can only find ways to have 2 of them. All 3 seems impossible. Any advice?",3,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 3}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9953561425209045}"

I was afraid to engage much on my main account because my anonymity would have been compromised, so I created this one.

I can't really remember when I first started smoking weed (or ""solid"" as we had then) but I was young and I know I've been smoking on a daily basis since I was 18.  Currently 35.  I am in the UK so weed is both illegal and smoked with tobacco, more reasons to quit.  Despite the legal status, my entire social circle smokes and it's so readily available that I can pick up at around 6 different places within 5 mins of my house.

I read a post today saying to focus on a few short term goals, so I've done that.  I've set up a cleaning schedule in my diary, I want to focus on my health and fitness and my art.

Like a lot of people here, I really wish I could be a casual user, any advice on how to truly let go of that idea?  I feel like I try but I can't seem to shake the image of that as an ideal.

People keep telling me I don't have a problem because I go to work and I don't play computer games all day or similar. But truthfully I don't take care of myself very well at all.  

I've had a chat with my social circle and my best friend and they're all supportive in theory and have the best intentions but I can tell from their comments that they're not going to stop offering me joints.  Please don't rip on them for this, they are good people and it's difficult to articulate exactly why I can't rely on them for support.

In fact, that's one of the things I am looking forward to MOST of all, being able to articulate myself better.  Communication was always a strong point for me and I have definitely noticed my communication skills have deteriorated over the years.

I noticed something last two mornings that I wanted to share with anyone still struggling with quitting.

When I was smoking, I can't remember a single night I went to bed sober. Whether I smoked during the day or not, had to smoke before I went to bed. Because how could I sleep without it! The whole time I thought, waking up a little tired or groggy was because I slept late, which was almost always. And usually I just did what I had to do to get through the day so I could get high again as soon as I finished my last zoom meeting. All my thoughts and planning were about getting high and staying high.

Now, I sleep when I feel I should and regardless of how much or how little I sleep I get, I wake up happy and usually alert. Last two mornings, I felt excited to be awake. I felt like there's so many things I could do today - read, workout, put in some time for my work, stretch, hang out with my family, or just spend time on my hobbies. And I'm doing them. And then I'm feeling like doing them again the next day.

Take back your life! Quit so you can remember what it was like to invest in yourself. What if you spent the same time and money you spent on weed on yourself? What would that look like? What would that do for your future?

Is quitting hard - sure. Is there a chance I will relapse - I'm sure. But why should a drug dictate how I live my life! 

I want my life to go the way I want. And that is not possible if I let the addict in me call the shots. And make no mistake, if you are high all the time, your addict is in charge.

Best of luck! Give it a shot. It is definitely worth it.

2021-04-04 03:03:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mjr807/6_month_checkin_from_the_new_me/,6 month check-in from the new me,"Hey sobergang,

I made it to 6 month last week together with my partner, so it is time for a check-in.

After more than half my life of smoking (37/m) in the end I believed it is part of me, my way of dealing with mild depression that runs in my family. Better than tablets or alcohol I thought. As many I am highly addictive and not only through corona I would wake and bake. Only enjoying the 6am high a bit, the rest of the day chasing a long gone feeling from the beginnings of smoking.

Really ashamed I am because I have to say that I am also a dad of a 2 and 4 year old. I remember my wife finding out about the first pregnancy and I thought, that could be it. I stop, I want to be a sober dad. My wife stopped immediately and just smoked in a little gap between weening the first child and being pregnant with our second. So in the end it was only me basically for the last 4 years. Being a dad and a stoner takes a lot away from being with your kid in my opinion. Yes, it seems like one can play easier and be funnier, but I find that to be an illusion. Now after 6 months I see that I am lighter in general, more present and therefore more fun with my kids.
Also I sucked at my job, I sucked at going out to see my friends, I sucked at grabbing life at the balls and change and grow. I was in a slump as Dr. Seuss would put it.

The first days were insane. I regulary still  read the posts here. I scan for similar stopping  times than mine, but I see all the starters and yes. I can say the first hump, the first days is the biggest one. After that there came weeks of instable moods, weird stomache and sleep, waves of selfhatred and regret. But it all fades slowly‚Ä¶

After 4 months I thought I damaged my brain forever and I got quite depressed.
I started a little sport, meditation, journaling, eating healthy‚Ä¶ all that. But I was impatient. So I also started to take medication for anxiety. I stopped again after a fwe days (I know they start working after 2 weeks only, before they make you feel drousy and bad stomached). I just moved to the UK from germany with my english wife and I still had to fly to germany, empty our flat. And my wife looking for a job in the UK. All during Brexit and Covid. So my cousin who is a doctor told me that if I wouldnt be anxious right now, when would I?

I did the move. We are in London.
We are crazy.

But now I am feeling better. I have to get back into my sport routine. Yes it is the best for the mood. Anxiousness someone here told me, is energy that doesnt know where it should go.

I still have a cloudy head from time to time, I feels lows and ups a lot, I do not have the best memory. But I am more stable in general. I do not hide from life. I do not have to go home in order to smoke, I am free in that sense. Also I found a new perspective for a job I want to do and am selfteaching myself at the moment. While I watch the kids during the days till they are back in preschool and nursery.

Not as detailled a report as planned in my head all the time :-)

In general I can not believe it took me so long‚Ä¶ it feels like a different life and me a different person. Only after 6 months. I was the last big stoner in all my friend circle.

I stopped regretting now and getting to work to change my life.
Am feeling happy about what I have.

Without this group I do not know how I would have done it.
All your stories showed me that I am not alone. That I do not need weed.
That it can be, but is not a medicine for us. That there is a different person after the addiction. One that we forgot about. But one that is happy to show up and say hi to you and all for loved ones.

As any addictive person I remember well that there is no one time anymore.
I see that when I balance my coffeeintake (1 real, 1 decaf) and how easy it is to slip to 4 espressos in a row when I let myself go a little.

Thanks sobers for all your stories‚Ä¶ I will continue to be with you and check-in for my 1 year anniversary.

Be proud of yourself. It is seriously difficult to stop. But possible.

I‚Äôve been smoking pot since I was 15 years old (Now 30) and have been a daily smoker up until about a year ago since the pandemic started. I stopped for 4 weeks then started back up again for about 3 months then 10 weeks ago decided to throw in the towel once again. 

I have to say, a few people I know have commented that I am more attentive and sound ‚Äúsharper‚Äù. Which is really great to hear. Also I feel like working is easier and I‚Äôm not struggling to figure things out (I‚Äôm in IT). 

Reason for quitting - I some how developed SEVERE social anxiety when I‚Äôd smoke to the point of not being able to go to the grocery store. It‚Äôs almost like I felt everyone was looking at me. I just felt extremely awkward and felt terrible. Also the constant brain fog was not enjoyable. 

Since quitting I can go anywhere and don‚Äôt feel this anymore. It took about a good solid 5-6 weeks for the brain fog and anxiety to go away.

I would always smoke everyday, from the moment I awoke to when I went to sleep.

Well today I‚Äôve gone over 1 month not smoking. I‚Äôve also been offered weed and been around people smoking but still declined, my mental will power has increased. I‚Äôm no longer a slave to weed.

First couple of days not smoking was horrible and incredibly boring, but slowly and surely I can now imagine a life without weed in my day to day life. I‚Äôm having so many dreams, I actually forgot what it was like to have such vivid dreams, although I must admit the dreams have been sort of wacky - and still are. 

Ive also been doing my learners for car driving, which I never did before due to fear of being pulled over and testing positive to THC - now there is no fear of this. Soon I‚Äôll be able to drive, and I‚Äôve noticed my social anxiety has decreased. Embarrassingly enough, I‚Äôm also studying to do health science, so I felt massive shame knowing I‚Äôm helping people yet couldn‚Äôt even help myself. 

I still love the idea of weed, but doing it so often and smoking so much was clearly not working well for me. I wanted to quit for many years but never had the will power to do it, I think what has also helped is me moving out of the place where I could easily obtain weed everyday - their was smoking utensils right in my face. Now it‚Äôs not so easy, but I still don‚Äôt want it even if it has been put in my face since.

This morning I was feeling super nauseous and hit my delta 8-thc cart, so I don't know if that counts. But I haven't hit it again, and hopefully I won't in the future. But I feel like such shit.

Just a thought I wanted to share with this community, I've tried to stop using in the past by denying myself the thing that I wanted most, and it felt fucking impossible. I would start the day with resolve, or end the day by tossing all of my drugs and paraphernalia, but when the Fuck It moment would happen (anxiety, anger, insomnia, etcetc) my brain would skip right back to my old reality of using. Simply being sober just meant I was denying myself the thing that made life bearable, so that Fuck It moment was an inevitability no matter how sure and confident I was when first making the decision to stop.

I've been wondering why I'm on day 11 -- it's not because I'm gritting my teeth in every moment or stuck in a loop of feeling sorry for myself -- it's because I'm actively seeing myself in Recovery now, not just being sober. Being in Recovery for me means checking in here with all of you, it means forcing myself to exercise and try meditation, not because these things come naturally to me, but because after being high for 20 something years, simply not being high leaves me feeling empty, off and miserable.

Everyone in this community says such kind and helpful things to others in crisis, but my own self talk is horribly negative. In my own mind, I am not worth it.

Changing this line of thinking, challenging my own self perception and trying to have the same amount of patience and empathy for myself that I have for others has been the difference this time. 

I want to be as loving to myself as I naturally am to all other addicts -- I'm not there yet, but fake it til you make it, right?

I‚Äôm on day 5 currently things have definitely gotten better overall since Tuesday.  (although right now I‚Äôm not so good) i started smoking in 2011 and smoked for 7 years and in late 2018 I quit for what I thought was for good. After I quit I dropped 30 pounds gained some muscle was in the best shape of my life hands down. Found a job that while requires a lot of hours, made me feel confident and happy. (Didn‚Äôt hurt I was making money hand over fist) fast forward to 10/20 last year, I decided I would start up smoking again. I originally quit smoking because after all those years one day something snapped and weed turned from an escape to a cage that caused me me to have overwhelming anxiety and horrifying panic attacks. I NEVER felt ANY anxiety nor did I have anything even closely resembling a panic attack. Idk what possessed me to start the habit again but I did. Almost 6 months of smoking just way too much. My job gave me so much disposable income that my habit quickly grew out of control. To put it into perspective I was smoking on average an oz a week at $200 for 3 months straight. I‚Äôm literally kicking myself for starting this again. Oh and I almost forgot that job that was giving me all that happiness and confidence before, well it became a chore everyday.

Today I am marveling at the power of the human body to heal and adapt. When I first started my quit, I made a promise to myself to focus on my physical health. Weed made me lazy, unmotivated, and fat. I was really like a poorly animated cartoon version of myself, I could have been the face of a DARE ad. 

When I first started jogging, I could barely do a half mile at a 10min/mile pace, and it felt like I was sucking air through a straw. I thought I gave myself COPD with all those years of smoking. Now I run 3.2 miles at a 9min/mile pace, and that will only continue to improve. I started dieting about a month before I quit weed, and I've lost 40 pounds since then. Rediscovering my personality has been great, but rediscovering the power and potential locked in my own body has been even better.

Now for the honest bit. I do still fight cravings, but they come rarely and nothing like the first month or two. Cravings have no choice but to pass and fade completely if you let them, because everything the brain does is a function of conservation of energy. If you do not act on the cravings, they HAVE TO fade because otherwise your neurons are just wasting energy by keeping them going. The brain does not like to waste energy!

If I take an objective big-picture view of my journey so far, the majority of my days are good days and quitting has been the best decision I've made in my entire life. My physical health is constantly improving, but more importantly so is my mental health. I do still have bad days occasionally, and I chalk it up to PAWS, practice self-care and keep moving forward. (When I talk about good days/bad days I mean mood and energy levels). 

If you're just starting out and going through withdrawal, the ""secret"" I have to share with you is this. Accept that you will suffer for a little while. Just accept it. Withdrawal is fucking awful but it's NOT the same as sobriety. Go through that suffering and do whatever you have to do to get through it because IT IS WORTH IT. Count your sober days or don't count your days, whatever works for you. But forget about focusing on the fact that you're sober. Just set goals for yourself and work on them in small incremental steps. Fitness, career, hobbies, whatever it is, just set reasonable goals and work on them slowly. The sober day-count will take care of itself.

Peace and love, keep at it and don't get discouraged. I smoked for 17 years. I knew I had a substance abuse problem and should quit for about 10 years. I tried and failed to moderate for about 5 years. It took me a long time to get here, it took me many failures.

I really felt like it was the time. It wasn‚Äôt, I have continued to smoke everyday and quitting was just no longer a priority. I‚Äôve found, like you must have, that the mind always finds a way to accept that you want to smoke. For me it was the fact that Seth Rogan and Snoop Dogg both have successful careers therefor I could also smoke and have a successful life. But today is realised something simple, for me there are a few cornerstones of life: sleep, eating, exercising, socialisation, mental health awareness. 

These things have to have precedent over smoking weed. They are the basics and if ones out of whack I know I‚Äôm not being who I want to be. 

Like me you‚Äôve probably quit and always had a sneaking feeling in the back of your head that you couldn‚Äôt wait to smoke again and that when you did you‚Äôd definitely not fuck it this time. And the good news is, you can but these other aspects of your life have to be concrete and if they slip weed has to be the first thing to go until they‚Äôre concrete again.

Seth Rogan and Snoop may smoke like chimneys and for good reason, weed is great, but they got the basics set, they let weed circle them rather than them circle the weed.

This change in perspective also helps with cravings etc because you can focus on these other parts of improving your life. Weed may come back into your life 3 months down the line when you‚Äôre a bit more in shape or you‚Äôve learnt to cook yourself a few healthy dinners, and you‚Äôve got a plan for your mental health problems. But it cannot be involved if any of those are out of whack for an extended period. 

I hope this helps you because ultimately most of us will continue to smoke in some capacity one day and this is a great way of having a healthy life and enjoying the plant how you should.",4,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9752124547958374}"

I turn 29 next week and decided my birthday present to myself is going to be seven days sober, and I intend to carry this one through indefinitely. 

I‚Äôve tricked myself over the years into thinking my use is manageable.

I've been a pretty heavy user for a while now, but I've been a daily smoker for the last 6 months. The pandemic and not seeing my friends in over a year has exacerbated my depression and anxiety, and weed helped subdue those feelings for a while.

I used drugs to runaway from everything I wanted to do because I had anxiety that I would never actually achieve those things. I wanted to feel fulfilled and so I would get high as it gave me grandiose delusions, a sense of belonging to a crew and made things feel new again. In the last three years of me smoking I became incredibly down as I slowly came to the realization that I passively let my life get away from me so I began the process of quitting. I went from smoking everyday to taking three day breaks to smoking every Saturday and now to be at the two week point when the evening comes around.

Since I stopped this time around, I have felt the following fx:

o Really tired in the mornings

o Apathy towards my job and current situation in life 

o Voice feels drained while singing and talking

o Depression and regret for misinvesting my time

o Confusion about what to do next

Although this sounds like quitting is a bad move, the way I see it is this is the hurdle I have to go through to be high without getting high. My friend and I were talking about this; we would get to day one, feel good and then say ""oh this quitting thing is not too bad maybe I don't need to stop if I can just quit and feel good the next day"". Then if we did quit for a week or so, the emotions would get so bad that we would say ""oh this is what feeling normal is like? I should just smoke again"".

No matter what I do to make my life better it doesn't affect any meaningful change. Certainly not any change I really need. I've genuinely accomplished so many things over the past few years...and it still doesn't fucking matter. I quit drinking. I quit cigarettes. I quit soda. I've lost weight. I eat much better. I cook. I've undertaken massive projects to get rid of junk and clean my living space. I've spent massive amounts of time trying to accomplish my goals that never happen. I've done my best to be the most attractive person inside and out. I try to give a shit about others. I try to be a good friend. And still, nobody fucking cares. Being a good person does not get you anywhere in this bullshit society.

But the thing I really can't deal with is the fucking dreams. I can't stand it anymore. All of you talk about how you dream again and how great it is. Well... I smoked specifically to quell the dreams. I just want them to STOP! I fucking hate dreaming. I didn't like them before I started abusing substances, I certainly don't fucking like it now. And since I quit weed (coming up on 3 weeks ago) I've only dreamt more and more. Every night it's either a nightmare, involving people or situations I really DON'T need or want to be thinking about. Or, the real nightmare is waking up, because the dream life was better. I'm fucking sick of this shit. I can't fucking stand this literal torture every motherfucking night. I really don't think I'll be able to stay sober anymore. It doesn't make any fucking difference to my life anyways so what's the motherfucking point? No really?

Thank you for your posts!,"I‚Äôve been a heavy stoner for about 2 years. As of today I am 2 months sober. I told myself it was because of my depression, ptsd and low back pain. I made excuses for it all the time. Sure 2 years isn‚Äôt much but it seemed like it considering everything I had went thru in those two years. This January I was put in a predicament. Stay smoking and hiding my problems; or tackle my sobriety and finish getting my welder certification and go get that job I really wanted. It would pay much better than these minimum wage jobs I had been taking since I started smoking. But I didn‚Äôt know where to even begin on my sobriety. Sure the obvious is to just stop lighting up and pre heating but I just didn‚Äôt want to think about losing my daily routine and my relief. Then I found this subreddit in early January. I read loads of your stories about tackling your own sobriety and some of the problems you faced. Lack of sleep, not being able to eat, depression getting worse for a while, pain, etc. and rather than deterring me it motivated me to take it upon myself and go thru it just as some of you had. It was definitely hard. I kept bud on hand in case I couldn‚Äôt do it. In case I needed to cave in. And also to remind myself it was that jar of bud or it was this career as a welder. The first couple weeks were awful. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Food tasted bland and even gross at times. I ended up losing 25 pounds in 3 and a half weeks as a result. Started to look sickly. But after that first month things got better. I could start to stomach food. My depression was a little easier to manage.

2021-04-02 17:03:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mitlhq/1w_completed_jounral_1/,1W completed - Jounral 1,"**Background:**

Last year of college, one of my friend I am toking with in my inital days tells me the day he smoked for the first time he has smoked every day since. 7 years later, I can safely say I have been in the same shoes for all these years like many fellow mates here. I will call myself a high achiever and weed has been my reward function all these years. But now I admit I have a dependence on weed and its an addiction. Period. But this post is more about week 1 so more about background in future posts. 

**Trigger to quit:**

One week ago I had to travel international, back to my parents house for a couple weeks and I had decided to use these 2 weeks to detox. It made me do a forceful cold turkey but it was supposed to be temporary and I had no permanent intention to quit. From day 1, I started to have withdrawl so I stumbled upon this subreddit and read literally hundereds of posts and could relate to a lot. The fact that I stumbled upon this subreddit was a major sign which lead me to first believe that yes, I do have an addiction. Next was a simple question to myself, do I want to be slave to this addiction and instant answer from my innerself was NO. After reading so many positive stories of quitting weed, I have decided to join the league and share my experience as I go along the path of sobriety.

**CHS:**

It was this subreddit where I discovered more about CHS(Cannabanoid Hypermesis Syndrome), and it was eye opening for me. I never had a very severe episode of CHS but I have had many days where I would wake up, drink water, throw up and get to my routine after taking a hot shower feeling nauseatic till late in evening. I have lost so much muscle mass and gone through 2 endoscopies trying to figure out whats causing it. I never got the answers till now. I was in constant denial that weed could be causing issues to my gut but I can connect all dots now and this is also a great trigger for me to say goodbye to this beautiful sticky flower. If you are here, you are most likely eligible to get it if you dont have it already and if you ask anyone who have had it, its miserable and so not worth the high or anything that weed gives you.

**Withdrawl:**

I can relate everything from appatetie issues, insomnia, night sweats, pounding heart rate, feeling low and depressed, nightmares (if I would get any sleep), low energy, shakiness. All these symptons are also psychosematic, the more I would read and think about these the more I would feel them. But I keep telling myself that its ok to feel like this for a week or 2 or 3 and it will pass as it does for everyone. On a horizon of lifetime, I am ok to feel sick for a few weeks. I have crossed week 1 and I am another post here telling that its already becoming little better. I am still long long way from a full recovery - its just the beginning of my journey, but I can say that I see the light down the road. My appatite is picking up which to me is most important. I see recovery as a healing process and being able to provide nutrition to body during healing is extremely important. Rest of the symptoms are better at times but do come back, as beautifully mentioned in one post that its a stochastic process but not linear.

**Helpful Steps:** 

I can not thank enough to every member of this community who has not just been helping me realise my addiction but acting as a great support system by assuring that there are better days in front of me. I dont know any of you but feel really connected. 

Long walks is something I am finding as a great exercise and distraction so far. Its not only helping with filling lungs with oxygen but also helping a little for sleep and building the hunger. I am doing 15-20 mins easy yoga to stretch my body whenever I feel for it, not forcing myself to do it yet. Although I plan to do it more often in week 2 as I think it has great positive effects.

Hydration is quite important, even though gulping a small amount of water was giving me stomach pain, this is something I am trying to not let go. With the detox, body needs to maintain the electrolytes and I am trying to drink a lot of water but I am still lacking a lot. Eating a lot of fruits is also aiding in hydration and restoration of elctrolytes.

Podcasts(addiction related or others) can be helpful if you cant immediately find hobbies to replace your activity schedule. 

If nothing works, just tell yourself that the best thing about time is that you like it or not, it will pass. And with every passing second you are more sober, more detoxed and healthier. 

**Further Plan:**

Plan forward is simple, and that is to let the time do its job while slowly making steps towards a healther lifestyle. Just making sure that I don't replace it with any other wrong habbit like nicotine or alchohol for now. I am being proactive in telling people surrounding me that I am on path of recovery and finding support where I can. 

I look forward to give you weekly updates on my progress and in mean time help anyone I can as much as I can.

I started as a social smoker when I went out to parties and such and eventually it gripped me. I started with just a gram a day and eventually went to 2 grams within the year, after 3 years I was easily smoking 3.5g to 7g daily with my smoking buddy (3.5 each). Approximately 8-12 Zoots a day, depending on how we rolled them, mostly mixing with tobacco, sometimes pure. My life took a spiralling turn, I didn't want to work or do anything productive, my excuse was always tomorrow, tomorrow so I literally spent years of my life watching movies and TV shows while smoking everything away. My brain started to forget what it was like being sober and then my entire mental state came crashing down, psychosis, dissociation, I felt like I was going crazy. Needless to say I couldn't see a way out.

4 months ago, reality hit me and I knew I needed to force a change. I didn't like who I was or where I was in life so I gave it all up. Cigarettes too, all of it. Today marks 4 months that I'm completely clean and I have to say things are starting to look up. I'm working actively again, I've started to exercise more, eat correctly but better yet my mentality is much better.
4 months ago I came to this reddit page and begged other people who were in similar circumstances to mine to give me some peace of mind and support, I felt like I couldn't go on and my life was done for. Crippling anxiety and fear took over me and I felt insane. Alot of people from here helped me out so much with words of support and comfort and today I've just come back to let you all know, I'm okay, I'm doing so much better and I won't ever go back to smoking. Even tho I reminisce of the days I used to, i think back to my deepest and darkest moments and the fear and agony I went through because of it. Those memories hold me strong and I never want to be in that mindset or feel that ""reality"" again.

I will hit 4 months weed free on April 6th.  My great aunt just passed last night...  I told my wife and she said, ""Well, were you close?""  I responded yes.  She continued to ask, ""Well, you never spoke about her.  Actually, you never speak about any of your family.  When your grandfather died, you didn't go to his funeral, so I just thought you weren't.""

I gave some excuse why I missed his funeral and hadn't gone back to Pittsburgh, where my mom and her family is from.  My wife mentioned to me that I just hadn't prioritized family like I had my drugs and alcohol use, and maybe if I hadn't been using marijuana, I'd have had the money and vacation saved up to go to the funeral.  

Her comments hit me really hard.  I try not to focus on the past and the mistakes I've made, but the not staying close to family really hit home.  She's very close to hers and made an effort to fly home every summer, even on her modest income.  

My mom didn't have a good relationship with her family, and that is part of the reason I chose not to visit or be close...  but each relationship is it's own and I did not make the effort with my extended family.  They didn't either, but that's not the point here.

Just sad, frustrated, and down on myself...  I'm living in a new location and haven't gotten my support lined up. Moved away from my kids from a previous marriage to give my current wife and child exposure to her side of the family...  Which brings it's own complications with my daughters (12 and 15).  Trying to get through a lot that I would just wash away with weed previously.

Apologies for the long-winded post...  I'd just like to know how others forgive one's self for their past behavior?  Addiction and substance use is complex and so are relationships, but I can't help but fault myself.  Even for moving away from my daughters to help set up a better life for my wife and son (he's 2).  I feel like I've failed myself and so many others with my actions.   And made weed a priority when it didn't help me, in the end.

Have a good Easter weekend everyone.  May your path lead you to a better place,

As of today I'm on day 8 of no weed (technically day 9 after 9pm tonight) and this shit is tough. 

Some days have been better than others, but today has certainly been the worst so far. I haven't taken a break this long in several years, and my body knows it. It's craving that next toke like crazy, I want it sooo badly today, and I haven't had cravings this strong ever.

I'm irritable, tired, can't focus, and highly unmotivated (currently at work). But you know what? I'm not giving in tonight.

There have definitely been some improvements among the drawbacks, too. I've had VERY vivid dreams the last few night, something I haven't experienced in years. My appetite its returning to a more normal rythem, and I'm drinking lots more water. I'm exercising, showering, and brushing my teeth more, just generally taking better care of myself. And on the good days, I really feel like I'm in control.

I just want to remind each of you reading this that you can do it. You *can* quit. It's going to get harder before it gets easier, but every day sober puts you one step closer to your goal. I keep needing to remind myself of that.

My goal is one month at least, maybe longer if I can handle it. I live in a legal state, so weed is always readily available. I'm just taking it one day at a time.

For the first few years of getting out of the chains of my addiction I struggled with a slew of mental disorders that robbed me of my mind and my health. Through some act of God, today, I have alleviated most of those disorders, changed my diet, changed my mind, starting working out, started becoming financially responsible, and started to love myself and others again.

I have been a heavy user of cannabis for nearly 8 years and the past four have been in absolute heavier excess of medical marijuana (vape pens, flower, and edibles). The catalyst to me quitting was (and I had wanted to quit for a long time but purely lacked the motivation and willpower) I had an episode of tachycardia after use two separate times. The first time I was having bad anxiety and ripped a huge bowl of just nug hoping to address the anxiety but all of a sudden I got tunnel vision and my heart rate jumped up to over 150 and stayed there for over two hours. I was just sitting on the couch. This really scared me but due to my lack of willpower I found myself smoking the next day and then it happened AGAIN. 

After that, I swore to never use again due to these horrible panic attacks and have quit cold turkey, 32 days clean since. Not gonna lie it has been super difficult. I really have no desire to use because of the physical impact. The first two weeks I was doing fine because I was really busy and had other things to  focus on, but then after getting home from a yoga teacher training I had another panic attack in which  I was alone which really scared me. I even went to the doctor thinking something was physically wrong with me but everything came back totally normal. For over a week after I was unable to move from the couch in deep depression, fatigue and weakness. That was the last occurrence of intense anxiety I have had but daily I still find myself having symptoms of dizziness (probs due to anxiety) and some slight heart palpitations. 

It is getting better though. and that is what motivates me daily to keep going is that each day may be a severe case of up and down but each day is a new chance to gain more resilience in dealing with these difficult emotions. We may feel so out of control when that anxiety strikes but I have been learning to turn my thoughts around and sidetrack the ones that bring me down. I feel more free than I ever have before, not constantly thinking about when the next time I am going to smoke or how I will get more weed from the dispensary, plus my finances are more in my control as well considering I was spending more than $400 a month on product. Also, weed is 1000% a drug that may be helpful to those with specific mind chemistry or chronic disease but can be incredibly addictive to those who are using it as a crutch. 

I am now grateful these experiences have empowered me to live more freely and aligned with exactly what I want to do, rather than being controlled by substance. For those of you struggling to make it past the fatigue, the weakness, the lack of dopamine and depression/anxiety from stopping use, this is your reminder to keep going and to stay strong and courageous. You absolutely CAN take control of your thoughts. Sink deep into self care and seek out eastern medicine to heal the body and mind even if it seems odd or counter-intuitive at first. Eat healthy and treat yourself well, all will come in time. I am so thankful for this sub as it has gotten me through some difficult days and given me hope that my brain will heal itself and chemically rebalance.

Many people encourage you to read, workout, meditate etc, but to be honest, that kind of intimidated me and made me feel like I had to do unenjoyable things to get over my addiction. Ultimately making my experience harder.","I was a chronic, heavy smoker daily for 7+ years.

Weed made my anxiety and depression EXTREMELY unbearable, and the sad part is, is that I knew it. It wasn't fun anymore, it was a mental battle for years trying to quit. It got to the point where the 'hype' of being high was way better than actually being high. The THOUGHT of being high made me want to smoke and then when it got to actually smoking and being high, it made me feel *much* worse. Ironically, the only few times I would cry was when I was high.

**I wasn't living, I was simply just surviving.**

Here is where the best part comes in, as well as the hardest. I knew I had to stop, but I knew it was going to be **extremely** **hard**. I had tried to quit in the past but it never worked. I would follow people's advice to read, workout, eat healthy but that just wasn't me and it made each quitting experience that much harder. I knew that for a couple of weeks I was going to have to go through the hardest/darkest time of my life and you know what I did, I sat in darkness, watched tv and slept for 2 hours a night (if that) and went to work feeling like shit. I didn't do things to motivate myself I let myself accept those extremely scary and depressive thoughts, and you know what, they started to *slowly* go away. As depressed and scared as I felt, it was better than that morning regret knowing how much you fucked up and how much you're that much farther away from bettering your life.

Fast forward a month and I am over the fucking moon. I don't even think about it anymore. **NIGHT AND DAY.** I can actually fall asleep at a decent time, earlier than I would high, and the biggest thing that changed my life was my self-hate. I hated myself, I forgot how to talk to people, socialize, I would get embarrassed trying to form a proper conversation when I used to be the most out-going social butterfly in the world. I want to see my friends more, I actually have a good relationship with my parents and want to be involved in their lives. **I LOVE MYSELF.** My anxiety went away and my will to live came back. I am starting to remember who I am. Quitting weed completely changed my life for the better. There is not ONE negative side effect I have felt from quitting. NOT ONE.

Just SOME benefits I experienced from just ONE MONTH of quitting:

\- Love myself (NO SELF HATE, I HATED EVERYTHING ABOUT ME AND NOW I ACTUALLY LIKE MYSELF)

\- Can properly articulate

\- Want to see my friends and family

\- Enjoy and appreciate food in such a different way, especially healthy food. (NO MORE BINGE EATING, already lost 7 pounds woot woot!)

\- Feel real happiness

\- DREAMS

&#x200B;

One thing to remember, you have to be willing and accepting to feel like SHIT for a couple of weeks, but a couple of weeks of shit is worth all the amazing feelings and life experiences you will receive.

FUCK READING A BOOK, MEDITATION AND WORKING OUT, SIT IN YOUR ROOM, FEEL FUCKING DEPRESSED AND WATCH TV TO PASS YOUR TIME AND THIS FEELING TOO SHALL PASS.

I was a daily smoker, would smoke a bowl as soon as I woke up and keep it going until I went to sleep. On work days I'd wait until I got home and smoke a whole days worth at night. I quit weed cold turkey after a public outburst of self harm (not my first incident) landed me in the ER and I had to see a psychiatrist who prescribed me drugs for my depression. 

I tried smoking on the first day of taking them, and felt sick. Very, very sick. So I decided I didn't want to do that again. I found out I gave myself mild serotonin syndrome. If I kept smoking to cover up those feelings I could've went into shock.

It was hard. For the first week I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't take care of myself and was very angry. But I'm already 7 months in and I don't feel radically different.

I bought a planner so I'd remember what I have to do. It helps a bit with my organization. But I still feel like shit. If I'm not working a dead end job that makes me hate myself, I sit at home playing video games and eating uncontrollably. I can easily eat 4 meals in a day and still snack between them, I just can't control the impulse at all. It's especially bad because I have IBS and have been constantly triggering myself pain and other things from this habit.

I switched my medications a few times, I've been to therapy, I even read a bunch of self help books. Still nothing. I haven't felt any motivation to do art since I quit. I used to draw for hours each day, now I forve myself to do it twice a month so I don't lose my skills. I feel like I have no creativity anymore, when I do manage to make something they all look the same.

Most of my friends left me after I quit, so I don't have much of a social network. Every day I wake up excited to go to sleep so the day can end, and that's it.

I leaned on this community a lot in my initial abstinence from weed/tobacco in early autumn last year. I owe you all a big thanks.

I had an issue with weed/tobacco for about 10 years until late September last year. I decided to quit because about a year ago, when the first lockdown happened, I started smoking even more (around 6 joints a day maybe), being even lazier and eating junk far too much.

It was a bday present to myself, turning 28, that i would treat my body with respect and give it the rest and healthy lifestyle it deserved/needed for once in my life. Generally, my progress has been great, I'm eating very healthily, working out/running 4 times a week, and am fairly happy. 

But now some restrictions have been lifted (in the UK) I've been able to play some football again which was supposed to be a good thing for me as I love it. But this week the weather was also really nice, and I couldn't resist drinking some alcohol with a friend for the first time in about 6 months. As soon as I had a small buzz from the alcohol, I wanted a fag. I knew I didn't want to smoke tobacco so I got an e cig to vape instead. I know that's not the end of the world but even that kind of felt like a bit of a failure. I've been vaping every day since, and knowing I'm not back at work for another 11 days or so, I've been very tempted to get some grass to kill some time and relax. 

I'm just feeling really low, don't know whether it's the alcohol, as I've drunk twice this week and hadn't done for so long prior. Or maybe it's a psychological thing because suddenly restrictions are lifting and that's triggering some kind of anxiety in me.

 I honestly thought I'd gotten through the urges but they are still here. Perhaps I need to accept that alcohol isn't good for me as it may just make me more anxious depressed, which triggers these urges.

I'm 24 years old and have been smoking for just over a decade. I have made multiple attempts to quit over the years; so far the longest streak I've managed is 7 months, which ended last June. I would like to be able to stay off for good this time, which will need to involve drastically changing pretty much every aspect of my life. I have allowed it to become a complete mess and if I don't get a grip soon, I'll waste what could be the best years of my life and have nothing to show for it.

One of the ways I want to do this is by feeling part of a community of people who want the same thing as me, hence here I am. I hope that by engaging more with like-minded people, listening to their stories and advice, as well as sharing my own, I can finally learn to live happy and fulfilled without the need for cannabis (or any other drug for that matter).

Anyway, there's not much else to say at this point, other than today is my first day at attempting to go cold turkey once again. Wish me luck.

The first two days can be pretty hellish, so just keeping your head down and pushing through or giving up are your only real options. Day 3 is when your body begins to adjust back to a point where you can think a little more towards the future, which really just means that you have more ideas on how to rationalize and justify returning to the ganj. **Remember that any rationalization is just that, an excuse.** 

In a sense, it's easier for me, because if I smoke now I will 100% lose my job.

On the other hand, every adult in the house I'm currently living in partakes several times per day. I can scarcely open a drawer or cabinet without finding a pipe or bong. The smell of the smoke is a frequent and obvious occurrence, but I don't resent them for this at all. In fact, I encouraged them not to stop their normal routine. It would only make me feel guilty if they did, and I enjoy the smell at least.

My 3rd day clean happened to be my 29th birthday. I was able to spend it with my daughters, my girlfriend, and my mother, and I honestly couldn't have asked for a better birthday. Distractions like spending time with family, reading books, and watching my favorite channels have helped tremendously. 

Honestly, despite some moments weakness and some INTENSE cravings here and there, today was a really really great day. Spending time with my family just serves to drive home the whole reason I'm doing this: it's not just about me anymore. I can't spend forever lazing about in a cloud of smoke, and I can't expect my daughters to do any differently unless I set the right example for them. 

Finally, I have an application on my phone that tracks my progress and calculates the money saved, which is nearly 80 bucks already!

Once I made it passed the first week I actually enjoyed my life again. I saw my family more, I was more sociable, I had a lot more money in my bank account, and life became a new norm. But the second I found out I was good to smoke, I did. And I did like there was no tomorrow. 

For the last week, more nights than not I‚Äôve woken up in the middle of the night because I can‚Äôt breathe too well. I keep having to clear my throat and i keep telling myself enough is enough.

I had been wanting to stop and worked really really hard. Got pregnant in June, baby in March 2020. When baby was about 9 mo and I had stopped nursing I thought, well all the reasons I wanted to stop before (to have a clean pregnancy, not smoking while nursing, being present as a mom, etc) had passed. Add the pandemic which has me isolated and working from home and I started to think what if I tried it again? It‚Äôs pretty harmless. I‚Äôve already shown I can stop if it becomes a problem again. 

As soon as I started I was back on the mental treadmill. I mean, it was great at first- finally some silly laughs and lightness, food and the munchies were a great indulgence, I‚Äôd smoke at night after baby went to bed. 

Within a month I was back smoking everyday. It just wasn‚Äôt worth the mental energy to fight with myself about whether it was okay or not, the I promise myself I won‚Äôt smoke tomorrow, then end up smoking tomorrow treadmill. Within two months I was smoking all day everyday getting high first thing in the morning. I ignored that it made me feel odd around my baby. That I could be second hand smoking his precious developing lungs. That I didn‚Äôt even want to smoke really I just wanted to quiet the voice in my head asking can I smoke yet?

After four months I noticed I was gaining weight from the every night binging since food was just so fucking good. I didn‚Äôt even really want to eat 10 cookies but after each one I just wasn‚Äôt ready to be done so would have just one more. 

I decided on Saturday that I needed to straight up cold turkey it and get back to the place of not spending so much energy thinking about it anymore. It‚Äôs easiest to know ‚Äúnope, can‚Äôt have any‚Äù than devote so much mental energy to - do I have enough to last me? Where and when can I get more? When can I smoke? Will my boss call me right after I‚Äôve smoked and be able to tell I‚Äôm having trouble focusing (very technical job)? Will daycare smell it on me? Even though it‚Äôs legal in my state, just because you can doesn‚Äôt mean you should. Well, that I should.

It‚Äôs made harder by the fact that I have a live in partner who smokes everyday. That‚Äôs his own battle to fight, but it also doesn‚Äôt seem to affect him negatively the way it does me. I mean after the baby came I made a short list of things I needed to do everyday for my mental health (shower, brush teeth, wash face before bed, walk or move my body 30 min a day, etc). By the time I‚Äôd been smoking again for a few months I was lucky if I was doing one of those things - would just get too lazy once I got high for the day. Going right to bed after eating ice cream or other sugary treats without brushing my teeth. Gross!

It‚Äôs been a hard and challenging year for so many reasons. But that‚Äôs no excuse really. It‚Äôs not fair to use the pandemic, or new baby with no family support because of COVID, or a traumatic birth experience with no space/support to process, or financial worries after being furloughed from my job, or isolation or any of the other challenges as an excuse to use. Ultimately I need to give myself grace being an overworked underappreciated scared and lonely new mom. I gave in to the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù voice. So I dust myself off and try again.

2 months ago if you would've asked me if I believed I could quit i would've laughed in your face. NO! That was my answer. But oh my god.... I feel so liberated. 

13 years of consistent smoking everyday. And I'm only 26. From the age of 13 I smoked every single day. I've never known what it is like to be sober and be an adult. Or even a teenager but sadly those are years i will never get back. But it's never too late. 

My thoughts are crisp, my memory is snappy, my creativity is beyond what it ever has been. I cant even describe in words how much better I feel. It just feels AMAZING. I was scared to take the leap and the first month was rough but it's all perception and self control!

No therapy, no MA, no meds, NOTHING. Cold turkey and it feels even better because of it. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. I swear on everything I love you will not regret it. Life may seem boring at first but once the metabolites are gone and you start running off of LIFE only, you will understand.

I was 6 months clean up until December and fell off the wagon because of some S.A.D issues when the brutal Midwest winter set in. I saw it as ‚Äúwell I can just have a blunt or something like once a month and I‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù That didn‚Äôt happen and I kept smoking throughout the month. 

I made it my New Years resolution to quit, threw away the one hitter I had... and picked up January 4th. I bought another one hitter soon after!

Since then I‚Äôve been smoking about 4/5 days a week and having a few spells of quitting for a week or so, especially as the weather improves I get tempted to text my dealer and light up the one hitter I bought. 

What I find so interesting about my personal addiction is that I know that I can be popped ANY DAY for a random test and lose everything. My consistent pay, my benefits, my coworkers I‚Äôve befriended and get to see every day and I STILL choose to pick up and smoke. i could lose my ability to pay back my student loans. i possibly tank my possibilities of getting another job because I‚Äôll have to tell my next employer I was canned for smoking weed. 

I‚Äôve kept my smoking a secret from my serious girlfriend, she thinks I‚Äôm not smoking any more and I feel terrible and guilty about it, but I‚Äôm STILL tempted to pick up again. 

I‚Äôve had hard cravings the last couple of days and even attempted to pick up again, thankfully plugger was dry and I chose to take that as a sign. He texted me today saying he has some dank Cherry Bomb Kush. I told him I‚Äôd let him know with no intention of letting him know. I‚Äôm proud of that because I would make that 30 minute drive multiple times a week to pick up a gram to lie to myself that this is last the time. 

I‚Äôm on day 5 and my cravings have seemed to subside a bit, but I don‚Äôt trust myself (especially after a few glasses of whiskey hahaha). I‚Äôve been steadily exercising and golfing and finding other things to pass my time and I feel much better. I am having frequent depressive spells during the day but I‚Äôm chalking that up to the withdrawal symptoms. I‚Äôve lost weight from not binge eating every night and I feel significantly better about myself and my body. I‚Äôve been having a few drinks every night to get over the cravings but I feel better about everything. 

Im hoping to keep this up and appreciate seeing everyone‚Äôs success stories to encourage me. I also appreciate those who feel vulnerable enough to admit they fall off, it makes me feel less alone in this battle.

I was so livid so I got on reddit to rant instead of texting the plug. One thing led to another and I ended up joining MA group for the first time today. Its really soothing to know there is a community that takes MJ addiction seriously AND offers support. Being taken seriously instead of being ridiculed that it's ""just weed"" is a comfort and green light I've needed for a while.

Earlier I felt my only options were ""rage out"" or ""smoke"". Clearly I'm fed up with being a stoner so smoking wasn't a REAL option. When I got to the meeting the topic of the day was EXACTLY what I was pissed about. I actually dealt with my emotions in a healthy group setting.

Maybe this wont be so bad if I keep seeking support in crucial moments. When it comes to withdrawals, my biggest challenges are currently lack of appetite and being irritable/very quick to anger. Will definitely become more involved in the Marijuana Anon community.

Life got heavier, harder, and darker as did my soul.

My mind is so much more efficient and the job I thought I hated?  Nope.  I didn't.  *It was ME that I hated.*  Somewhere in the midst of my addiction a voice whispered ""Why do you hate yourself so much that you are abandoning everything you worked so hard for?  You have quit living and have become a shell of a person. You blame everyone and everything outside of yourself -- but you are literally inhaling the source of your misery every damn day.""

Thank you for the ear and support and I know we can all get through this! I plan to post to this sub at least monthly to chart my progress and just want to say again thank you all Beautiful people.

I‚Äôve found that each time I try to quit one I end up relying heavily on the other, so this time I‚Äôm just cutting both out entirely. I‚Äôve been on autopilot smoking 3-6 spliffs a night for the last ~2 years and have been heavily reliant on them for sleep and sex. I finally decided that smoking was seriously affecting my emotions, especially around my period which, in turn, was taking a toll on my relationship. I found myself lashing out at my partner and starting fights just cause I was jonesing for a spliff or cig. The last few days have been pretty heinous as I havent slept more than 3 hours a night without a spliff to put me to sleep, and my sex drive has been pretty nonexistent, but I‚Äôve been determined to push through for myself as well as my relationship. 

Last night, I was trying to go to sleep doing the thing where I freak out about not being able to fall asleep. I finally got close when my SO decided to tell me that recently he hasn‚Äôt felt loved and feels like our relationship is dying. I totally freaked and felt totally blindsided. I knew I had some things to work out with myself in order to be able to be a good girlfriend, but recently I have been trying so hard to improve myself for the sake of the relationship through therapy, self care, and overall just trying to organize my life. I guess since I was focusing on so much on myself, I had been totally neglecting my partner which devastated me. All I wanted was to smoke, both to calm my anxiety and help me get a little sleep before I had to wake up for work. I fought with myself for a while about it until finally I decided to resist. I told myself I just can‚Äôt and that‚Äôs that. I woke up this morning feeling really shitty about the relationship stuff, but I felt so proud of myself for being able to resist in that moment! 

I know this is the best move for me in the long run, but how do you all stop from completely turning inward and focusing too much on resisting to the point where you‚Äôre messing up other parts of your life? I told my SO I just needed some time to get it together and maybe we need a little more space for the next couple weeks or so, but they were really resistant to that. Any advice?

Pretty much since graduating from undergrad. It really ramped up during Covid, especially since I had an awful breakup during the start of it that left me in a mental health facility for about a week (where I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 disorder). I ended up relying on weed instead of my meds since they made me feel like a vegetable and thought for a while that it was helping, but I was spending the bulk of my money on weed just to get through the day, and it left me so detached from the world I honestly thought I was in purgatory for a while. Barely eating, crying everyday, no contact with friends and barely any with family, plus worried all the time about making rent payments but with no energy to actually look for better work.

I honestly have lung issues to thank for me quitting. I began having coughing fits maybe a month ago. But stupidly I'd still smoke in the evenings. Last week things got so bad that I could barely breathe one morning and spent the day coughing and wheezing and praying that I'd live. I was too afraid of going to the hospital since I was paranoid about being held and just disposed of by some florence nightingale. So I stayed in my apt alone and just figured if I did die it was better to go in a familiar setting. After day 2 of not smoking my breathing got a bit better and I was able to sleep, but then the nightmares started and night sweats and diarrhea, and struggling to eat and horrible mind thumping anxiety. 

Its day 5 and I'm finally breathing for the most part normal and eating and sleeping regularly. Still having crazy vivid nightmares but my waking mood is much better. I'm not taking meds or even drinking right now, just going for walks and reading positive things, listening to classical and love music, praying a lot and overall working on absorbing good thoughts and feelings. Its working, and I have no desire to ever return to that circle of perdition I found myself in for months...years really. 

Stay strong for all those battling this demon. It promises a lot at the start and perhaps for many its harmless, but for those susceptible it'll try to consume you. Don't let it! Rip this weed from your garden, you are stronger!",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9945613741874695}"

Having seen this subreddit years ago as a high schooler, my immediate reaction was one of confusion; for so long, I couldn't fathom why anyone **wouldn't** want to smoke weed. However, after almost 5 years of daily smoking, I can safely say that concept of ""too much of a good thing"" is all too real. 

Part of me wants to dedicate this post to telling my story, but I have the feeling that being a creative and bright kid who picked up weed smoking in high school and boxed themselves into addiction isn't exactly unique. Instead, I'd like to vocalize the fact that, despite popular perception, myself and many other members of this subreddit have experienced some very negative consequences from using that drug. In my personal experience, I've found that dependency on marijuana comes with a bevy of harsh side effects, both physical and mental. 

Over the course of the last year in particular (which, between the stress and isolation, most likely exacerbated my dependency), I've watched as my face dried up, my eyes sagged, my skin paled, and my muscle mass disappeared. My teeth have yellowed considerably, and my hair has thinned and become finer to the point that, at times, I can barely recognize it. The emotions I was getting high to avoid, after years of running from them, began to manifest themselves when I was using, and I was soon experiencing more dread and hatred than ever before. 

I've tried to quit in the past, and couldn't find success almost certainly because I didn't want it enough. I've dealt with a plethora of bullshit these past few years, and feeling like I'm on the tail end of it, feel capable of showing myself the kind of self love necessary to really make a meaningful change. And despite the fact that most of this post comes off negatively, I've actually felt a love for myself and the world that I haven't experienced since I was a very young child. I'm excited for things; excited for life, love, beauty, the future. And maybe the best part? That beautiful future feels totally within my grasp. 

I really hope this little post finds everyone here well, thank you all so much for inspiring me to lead a life that feels genuine. I know I'm at the start of a long road, but I'm ready to really take it for what it is, and start living life again.

But quitting weed hasn't been an issue for me and I don't crave it (which is good!) howeved since I quit, I do feel like my depression and anxiety has worsen. Everything feels so heavy and I completely lost motivation for life. I feel very irritated and easily upset all the time and have very little energy to do things. Everything is triggering to me. I also feel heavy brain fog, I have a hard time focusing and remembering thing. 

I was thinking this might be because whenever I was high, I avoided all my problems and reality and now that I'm sober all the time, its all hitting me. Has anyone else had similar experience? How long does this last?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995269775390625}"

I'm a longtime lurker (21M) who's tried to quit multiple times already. For personal reasons, I'm posting this through a separate account, but I wanted to share my experiences with you all. 

As someone who's gone through wanting to quit and subsequently relapsing multiple times, I want to offer whatever support I can to those in a similar situation. Personally, I am motivated this time by entering the workforce and starting the next phase of my life. The first few days were agonizing (night sweats, insomnia, no appetite), but I haven't even realized that today marks my 21st day of sobriety.

I have been having some mental health issues (depression). So I just have to stop.,"I've had various anxiety and depression issues over the years and recent events have thrown me into a deep depression. 

I've stopped before so I know I can do it. I'm at a point where I'm really not enjoying it at all any more. 
It was a way of getting through the isolation and anxiety/fear of the pandemic. But I just had a very rough year. I need the clarity and motivation so I can move forward with my life. 

I'm thankful to have this place as a way to be accountable. It's such a great community. Thank you all for the wonderful, interesting and encouraging posts.",5,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.966708242893219}"

Nothing sounds appetising knowing I can‚Äôt smoke first. I‚Äôve smoked before meals for the past four years and now that I can‚Äôt... I just don‚Äôt want to eat anymore. Which is dumb, I know, but the rational side of my brain isn‚Äôt the strongest. I know I‚Äôm in a bad mood not just cause I‚Äôm not smoking, but also because I haven‚Äôt eaten all day. I know that eating will fix part of the grumpy. But that silly emotional side of me just wants to be petulant and say no food until I smoke. 

Anyway, just a vent to probably the only people who get it. I told my partner that wherever he stops for food, I‚Äôll just get that and get over myself. I already made it through the first day all by myself at home, and I can get through sober eating too",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989142417907715}"

The first week was horrible.  It seemed like there were so many hours in the day but nothing to do.  I honestly felt like I would‚Äôve rather been dead.

Is this normal?
