I have much less of an urge as of late to do things that I typically did to escape, such as jack off, play video games, watch TV, or alter my state of mind through drugs.

Meanwhile I'm doing more things that are connective with my emotions, such as exploring art, writing poetry, and having nicer fashion than when I was a stoner.

This whole experience is hard. I've identified that life is hard no matter how you slice it. On one hand, I could take the ""easy"" route and just smoke my days away never confronting my anxiety. But then I will never reach my full potential and I will regret it my entire life.

On the other hand, I can face my fears and try to accomplish soemthing meaningful to me (which currently is getting into a good school and getting published in a literary journal) and feel pride in having done so.

I am on my second week now, this comes after 30days clean, then a single relapse of one session, and then another two weeks followed by smoking the whole weekend. Now I’m at 2 weeks again

My withdrawals are severe. I am tired everyday and cognitively impaired. I find it difficult to follow a group conversation and understand the banter, and have to really force myself to focus and follow.

I keep thinking fuck it, I just wanna get that euphoric upbeat and positive energy back, as otherwise I’m quite socially anxious and inhibited with people, and struggle to have fun. Weed totally brought me into that extroverted state of being, and it sucks to let it go but the cognitive impairment is just not worth it.

Never before felt a force inside me to improve this desperately.,"So I made it to my first full day without smoking in like 3 years(first intentional day without smoking). But I did this because of something that went down that made me really reflect on my usage. Recently I’ve been getting very emotional which I think is part of how weed usage will affect you. Because of these emotions, my insecurities began to stem out and I said things to my girlfriend such as “I don’t think you love me like you used to” and so on. This resulted in her wanting to take a break, but she told me she still loves me and doesn’t see me as a friend. As one fellow leaver could expect, the first thing I did when my girlfriend made this decision was attempt to smoke the pain away. 

Yeah I tried to smoke the pain away, but let me tell you it DID NOT work at all. 

What actually ended up happening was I got way higher than I should have and started literally hallucinating my girlfriend crying even though she was 2 hours away. This was a huge wake up call for me. Never again do I want to put anyone in a position where they’re that sad. It’s been really hard, I haven’t been contacting her because I’ve heard that’s the best thing to do during a ‘break’. It’s really hard not to get depressed and start messaging her about how I was wrong, but I realize doing so is futile. This is the time I need to start focusing on how I can improve my own life, and quitting weed is the first step. 

It’s time for me to become someone I can love and respect, starting now. I may have made mistakes but I gotta stop letting them weigh down my life, and start moving on. From this point forward, I’m going to respect and love myself through my failures and successes, and trust that the hard work will pay off. 

Hope everyone is doing well, and if you made it to this point, thank you for taking the time to read my story.",6

I am never that negative when sober.

And it's not only that. This depression seeps into the next day in forms of increased anxiety and lethargy. 

I don't want to do anything and don't feel anything. Just a demotivated haze in which I easily turn to weed again, unsuccessfully trying to exit that haze.

But I just prolong it. Prolong this down and depressed/unmotivated feeling which makes me also hate myself at the end of the day.

My mental health is in very poor state, and my consumption of weed insanely high (to me.) 

Today I didn't get on until after midday. I have a toddler so my days start early. The entire morning that I had to be sober I was bawling my eyes out. My mind was running rampant with thoughts of suicide and reliving a recent attempt  of mine that I truamatised people I love with. 
 I kept apologising to the little one for crying so much and being such a shit mother. 
I was starving, my stomach felt so empty, it was painful, but alas, I had no appetite. I also couldnt drink my coffee, which is the second thing I do every morning, after a couple of cones. It tasted completely wrong. I imagine the lack of caffeine and nicotine (I dont smoke cigarettes but I do mix tobacco into my weed) helped contribute to the intense headache. 
Then I kept thinking about how pathetic I am without weed, and how pathetic it is that I'm hoping to get on later, because I know the cycle is just going to continue. 

I had a phone 'intake' appointment with someone from a drug and alcohol service recently and now I'm awaiting the local health care provider to recieve my referral and contact me for my initial appointment with them.

I tried quitting weed a couple months ago and was doing good for about a month and a half. During that time I met a girl in my college Spanish class and she seemed really cool, got her number and was texting with her for a week or so before I asked her out on a date. She said yes, we made plans to get coffee, everything was Milhouse.

Until a couple weekends ago, when I decide to give myself an off day and get super ripped with a couple friends. I decide it's fun so I start letting myself doing it more and more, figuring hey look at me I must have figured out how to be high or smth. I gradually fall back into my old habits and eventually the anxiety, the brain fog, it all starts coming back again and I begin to feel depressed, just like the first time I quit. Six days ago I finally waketfu and realize I have to permanently drop this stuff, I clearly can't handle it and I'm not enjoying life nearly as much as when I was sober.

During that time I was getting high, I pushed back the date a bit, partly because I got sick, partly because I was feeling the anxiety again and, knowing I wasn't at my best, I didn't want to ruin my chance at this girl. Well obviously you can only do that so much before they lose interest, so I decide it's now or never, it has to happen this weekend.

The date is a TRAINWRECK. I can barely focus on what the girl is saying, my mind is just an anxious hyperactive chimpanzee on speed. I can barely hold a conversation for more than two minutes and the awkward silences are *eternity*. Sometimes I blurt things out I don't even believe or are true. All the confidence I'd felt talking to her before has evaporated and I'm silently kicking myself for being simple enough to think I had ""figured out"" the drug that had already damaged a good handful of my relationships. The date was only supposed to last an hour and a half since I had to work, but I end up bailing a half hour early because I can sense it's going nowhere and I just want to gtfo of there before I embarrass myself more.

So now I just got back from work and simply put I feel like dogshit. Maybe we wouldn't have hit it off that great even if I'd been the ideal confident me, but now I'll never know and it sucks. On the bright side, I have never *ever* felt more motivation to quit weed, and hopefully every time I get a craving I can look back on this experience and remember the 1234532521 reasons weed is not in my life. /rant :(

You can look through my history if you like for more detailed info, My story is that I experimented with vaping cannabis for a few months from June - August. I'm in my late 30's, and am generally quite fit and healthy. Never had any serious health complications until now. My last experience with weed was when I vaped a large amount for my tolerance (About a gram). A couple of days later I had a huge panic attack in the middle of the night. What followed was pure hell, the beginning of Post Acute Withdrawl Syndrome (PAWS). The next few months I endured an avalanche of symptoms. Disassociation, Massive Brain Fog, Headaches, Anhedonia, Panic Attacks, Brain Zaps, Nerve Tingles, Head Pressure, Dizzyness, Nausea, fatigue, phantom smells of Cannabis. There's probably more I'm forgetting. But there it is. Pure straight hell. I'm so lucky I've had some people support me through this.

In month 4 I began having a small turnaround. The fog began to go and I began to be able to feel sensations again in my head. My disassociation started to lift as well. Just a little.

Here I am at 6 months. I'm happy to report a great deal of improvement and stability. Particularly in the past three weeks. My brain fog has lifted considerably. I now realize that my diassociation is coming and going. I had it somewhat strongly yesterday, but not very much today. The anhedonia feelings in my head are still there, but not as bad as before. Brain Zaps have stopped in the past month. So have the nerve tingles. I haven't been dizzy or nauseous for a long time. I still have headaches and slight disorientation from time to time, but it's so much more minimal.  

My head used to feel completely empty. No sensation. No nice feelings from a smile, etc. Now it feels like my normal head again, but with the electricity still not quite wired correctly.  I feel emotions and sensations better at home where everything is calm, and less so when there's lots of external stimuli. An example of how I know my head is working better, when I drink cold drinks now, I can get a brain freeze. I simply could not get one months ago. Likewise yesterday I drank a cold water when I was really thirsty, I felt a strong rush of positive feelings in my head from drinking it. That has been absent for the past 6 months.  

So...this condition is getting alot better. In fact I feel now it's at least something i can manage without being too depressed or crying on other's shoulders all the time. Feels more like something I can handle myself now. More frustrating than debilitating at this point. 

As well, I saw my Dr. Today. He agrees it's PAWS, and that 6-18 months may be the timeline. I'm having an inflammation blood test being done soon to rule that in or out.  He did say something I thought was encouraging. He said PAWS can even come from deep grief/trauma. I took that as my brain is just coping with a lot of stress and will eventually recover. He seems to feel I'll be back to 100% eventually. I am hoping he's not just telling me what I want to hear, but he said he's had a few patients over his career go through something like this and recover. 

I'm really taking care of my nutrition and exercise for the most part. I'm hoping the next few months are a big turn around for me as people say month #6 is a strong healing month (I'll agree that so far it's been the most strong month I've had) . I know PAWS is recurring, so I may feel better for awhile and then have a streak of bad days. At least I've done Marathon training before, so I know what it's like to stick something hard for a long time. 

Emotionally,  I've been dealing with so much guilt, and shame. I just thought Cannabis might be a fun way to escape like alcohol. I've binged with alcohol long ago, and on other rare occasions...but I never had 6 months of sheer nightmarish terror from a weekend bender with booze. I feel so damned unlucky to be in this mess. Blame my own susceptibility to external pressure and my susceptibility to the propaganda advertising cannabis as a panacea. So far, my life is intact, but I feel like it's been such a mess. 

But a message of hope for you all. If you have had this hell come upon you, and you are in month 1,2,3...keep on being strong. You will start to get better soon. It's one inch at a time with this thing. 

PM me if you want any other advice on how I'm handling this experience.  Thank you all for your support.",13

2020-02-28 14:54:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fb0ipr/nothing_is_exciting/,Nothing is exciting,"I tried weed for the first time when I was 20 with friends. I basically didn’t smoke much again until 21. At that time I lived with a roommate who was a daily smoker and always offered me smoke a joint. By then I was smoking more but I wasn’t buying weed and never felt the need to smoke. 

Shortly after I turned 22, I started dancing at a strip club. At that point I started to buy weed and smoke more but one gram could literally last me a month ( miss those days). Eventually I started needing weed to work, the thought of dancing without being high sounded terrible and eventually I always went to work high. I had other jobs while dancing and I didn’t always smoke before those but eventually I started hating my retail job and I would smoke before work often.

By the end of my dancing days, I had a boyfriend who smoked all the time. I basically stopped buying weed because it was always around. When we broke up, I kept smoking of course to deal with it maybe more. My non smoking roommates moved out and before I knew it, I had new roommates and all 3 were everyday stoners. I was in my last years of college and all my close friends had moved. Smoking daily didn’t seem like a problem, I still had a relatively low tolerance ( an eighth would last me a month) and life was so stressful and lonely and weed worked every time.

By the time I moved out of that place, I was a daily smoker, as many times a day as I wanted, work was not a concern because I never had an issue doing a good job or keeping a job but then an eighth lasted me 3 weeks, then 2 weeks, and now an eighth will last me about 5 days. 

Every person I date is a stoner which doesn’t help and whenever things end I smoke more to deal with. I smoke to poop, to eat, to shower, to go out, to grocery shop, to do chore everything. I used to not smoke when visiting family, but now I always bring some with me. 

I hotbox my car sometimes before work and the smallest things seem unenjoyable without weed. My throat has been feeling sore for the past year and I’ve continued to smoke every day with only a 2 day break in the past year. I love to sing and I don’t wanna ruin my voice before it hits its potential. 

I just got the grounded app, I’m one and a half days clean I’m trying to go 2 weeks because I’m going to a concert in a legal area and I know I’ll wanna smoke but I wanna actually feel it. I’m not sure if I need to give it up all together or just lower my use but I’m trying to find enjoyment without being high and it’s really hard.

I’m 27 now, I stay busy with dance classes, working 2 jobs, roller skating etc but those moments when I’m home alone it’s really hard to not smoke.

Anyway, wish me luck, thanks if you read this far.",7
2020-02-28 14:17:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fazy63/a_month_in_from_quitting_heres_my_story/,"A month in from quitting, here's my story.","It's been a little over a month since I have quit smoking weed for good since January 22nd. I quit primarily for health reasons, mostly because I was really huffing and puffing getting around town. I wanted my air back and I came to the conclusion after smoking heavily (at least 1 gram) every night without fail for 2 years it was time to give it up. It had always been in the back of my mind to quit or slow down at some point but I was so engrained into a routine of coming home from work making dinner and smoking multiple times before bed that it just didn't factor in until I started having trouble breathing during the day. It was then I had to ask myself, if I feel this way now, how am I going to feel 3 years from now when it's 5 years heavily smoking? 10 years? 

That first week was tough. I took away my nightly comfort. The very thing I looked forward to every night. I had many sleepless nights to start, laying in bed for hours waiting for sleep to settle in. I was emotional, I had to deal with some family issues that exacerbated my emotions as well. I had relied on weed as a crutch for so long and as bad it was for my lungs, it was also bad for my mind. It made me paranoid about things that could go wrong and lazy about getting things done. Quitting cemented in me something I knew from the start; that weed is a drug. It seems harmless, and for the most part it is. But smoking is bad for your lungs no matter what these at home google doctors/drug dealers will try to tell you. 

I had come out of a bad place when I started smoking weed again 2 years ago, and it gave me something to look forward to every night and made me stay steady. But the toll it took on my lungs and psyche were not worth the habit. If you need to smoke weed like you need to eat dinner every night, you got a problem. Especially if that problem is taking years off your life, and risking future problems for yourself like chronic bronchitis and lung cancer. Anyways I just needed to vent because I still follow r/trees and I just want to get on there and say ""YOU'RE FUCKING DRUG ADDICTS AND YOU'RE KILLING YOURSELVES BY SMOKING!"" but I know I didn't want that buzz kill when I was smoking and I'd just get downvoted to oblivion anyways. 

If you want to quit, look at the hard facts about what smoking does to your lungs, and don't be a fool to think vaping isn't harmful as well. Like I said that first week is tough, but it gets better after that on so many fronts, just don't put too much on your plate with your new found energy. Good luck folks who are trying to quit, if I can do it so can you.",7

2020-02-28 13:42:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fazevc/weed_dreams/,Weed dreams,"So I have been sober from weed for a little over 6 months now. I had the brief period after stopping where my dreams went absolutely wild - crazy adventure every night, sometimes very vivid nightmares, mostly just adventures though. That stopped within weeks of quitting weed. 




However, I also take a medication that has a known side effect of causing more vivid dreaming, and so I have gone from no dreams when I smoked every day, to pretty vivid dreams almost every night. These dreams aren't as involved as when weed was working its way out of my system, but I can still usually expect to wake up from some sort of in-depth, very real-feeling dream every morning.



For the past week or so, these dreams have been of me breaking sobriety and getting high. The dream will start with my smoking without much context - I don't remember that I quit weed, there's no real detail around where I am or whom I am with, but I usually smoke out of a pipe. Then the dream continues with me going about my day, and awhile later through the dream I realize that I am high. Like, dream-me forgot that I smoked but then I realize I feel high. And I actually feel high. I feel the sort of contented disconnect that I associate with marijuana, I feel the weighted sluggishness that keeps me from being productive. It's very disorienting to wake up from. In the dreams I even feel the ambivalence towards weed that I felt for the last several years of my use - I enjoy the high and how I move through the world with it, but I also feel terrible that I broke my streak of sobriety, I feel the anxiety of being high in public, I feel disappointed in myself.



It's been very odd, and it keeps happening. I've had these dreams occasionally over the last six months of sobriety, but this week I've been having them most nights. I think it's caused by a combination of having recently passed the 6-month mark, which was a big one in my mind, and also the fact that a lot of things are changing in my life right now. I start a new job soon, I need to start looking for a new apartment, and I started a work-out boot camp thingy that I really hopes turns into better habits long-term. I feel like my brain is processing the emotional reality of moving on from weed, and what that means in terms of my day-to-day patterns of behavior. It's odd. It makes me miss weed, but it hasn't made me want to smoke. Thanks for reading :)",2

It isn't obvious because it's purely psychological so it's easy to overlook. My defense mechanism is paranoid projection. During and after the high I realized that my mind is looking around in the environment to explain the way it feels. This leads to endless conflict and paranoia.

I used to hear that every high has it's low, but I used to tell myself that the only low weed had was that I couldn't stop smoking it. Last night I smoked with no tolerance and just woke up from a dream about my friends inviting police to our DnD session. What was happening was this:

1. My body and brain were crying from the pain of the comedown.
2. The mind created a reason to blame for the discomfort.
3. A side effect is that it reinforces the victim identity that caused me to smoke originally.

Realizing this a couple of weeks ago was what made me decide to quit. Once I understood the basic mechanism for what I was really doing to myself, it was much easier to start making steps in the right direction.

A couple of other quick examples:

1. When closing at work, I would become scared I would forget something or mess it up and I would go on rants in my head about why my boss ""Thinks that someone will fire him for the smallest thing and therefore makes me do all this stuff!"" I was projecting. I was making myself do all that overkill stuff because I was coming down.
2. My friends and I went to eat after I smoked. I became paranoid that my dog had gotten out even though that was ridiculous. When we returned home to ensure the dog was inside, I realized I felt better before we even opened the door. The dog wasn't the real reason for my upset, that was just the projection again. The real reason was that I was stoned in a public place and feeling uncomfortable.

People don’t take weed addiction seriously. 

I’m so thankful for this community, guys. It’s like my safe haven where I can get away from society’s weed obsession and be around people who share my belief that it’s a hindrance (at least in our personal lives). I’m aware it’s not always bad and some people can handle it fine. It’s just frustrating that even in support communities people just don’t take it seriously. They compare it to fast food and coffee. I’ve never had my coffee seriously alter my state of mind like weed does, like cmon they just aren’t the same and shouldn’t be compared. If I were to go on that same group and talk about how much I just love alcohol and it makes me feel so good and sociable I bet you anything people would be butt hurt saying “you shouldn’t talk like that in a sober support group” but say the same thing about weed and everyone agrees and defends it.

I started to smoke when I was 17.  My sister and brother introduced me to weed.  I wound up liking it so much that I started to sell it to support the habit.  I eventually leveled up in the 'game' and became 'the man' around the block.  It made me feel so good when people would come to me for a bag and I'd always have it for them.  I was the dealer you could count on.  I did this shit for years with many ups and downs along the way.  I was robbed of 2 pounds when I left my apartment window cracked.  What happened after this?  My dealer fronted me 2 more lbs and I went on my way doing the same thing.  That never stopped me.  I also never quit smoking.  

This went on for 4-5 years.  I wasn't making a killing doing this but I sure was making money.  All the money I was making I would blow on stupid material things that never had any sentiment value.  I also was working a part time job as a cook.  One day I leave work and I get pulled over.  Back tracking to the cook job.  I used to bring 8ths and qtrs to work already bagged up and ready to go.  I would get people calling me while I was at work wanting bags of weed.  So I would sell weed out of the place I worked at for a couple years... Anyways I left work one night and I was pulled over with about 115 grams.  A little over a qp.  I was arrested.  I kept my mouth shut as the police were questioning me where the stuff came from.  I wound up getting a lawyer with the help of my parents.  Whom really was supportive of the whole situation.  The lawyer was able to get me 2 years probation.  No time.  I pissed in a cup for 2 years.  I was 25 when I got off papers.  The day I got off probation I wound up calling an old friend and got me some herb to smoke.  From then on I never looked back and started smoking morning to night daily.  My parents wound up moving down to florida when I turned 27.  So I decided to move down to Florida and try to start my life over.  I came down here with the intention of never smoking weed and keeping myself clean.  I wound up getting a job within the first month being in Florida.  Another cook's job.  I met some people there which influenced me into smoking weed again.  I had a really hard time saying no for some reason.  I wound up smoking everyday again and became an asshole if i wasn't high.  I would go an 8 hour shift without smoking... the last 2 hours of my shift were miserable as i would be ready to smoke.  So what did I start to do?  I would bring shit to my work.  I wound up getting caught smoking outside of my job.  The manager didn't fire me but made it clear that it wasn't to happen again.  I wound up quitting that job and didn't work for 2 years after this.  I would still manage to find ways to get herb with no money.  

Weed would make me unsocial.  I stayed in my room doing nothing but watching tv or playing video games.  I didn't have a drive to want to do anything with myself.  I fell very alone and didn't care about my family and always kept to myself.  I would never share my thoughts with anyone.  If I did i would always have an attitude and It would come off the wrong way.  I'm not blaming weed but I think it has something to do with the way I am.  I am 3 days now sober and I know its for the better.  Fuck weed its not for me.",10

I have a little something to bounce off you all of you who read this;

I have now been approximately ""off"" weed for one year and had been pulled back in after 8 months and a 4 week backpacking through the Phillipines.  It was hard getting back into western society, work, work, work (esp. In Canada where hard work and advancement is being punished through taxation).... about a month being back on home soil, my emotions are somewhat now regulating. 

A little context, i am 38 years old and on average smoked weekly everyday from my first honey oil blade at 17.  I am self made and self assured. I went back to school at 30 and entered a new work sector. At 22, i backpacked through Central America, South East Asia and a few countries in between.  My travels have tought me a lot inwards and outwards.

Last year, i enrolled in a university law course and it has  
intellectually kicked my ass and to all looking for a reason to stop smoking  (jump into something that challenges you and will make you grow).


To the point..I am feeling extremely alone right now.  My blood family is extremely programmed in terms of capitalist programming.... stuff....stuff and more stuff ""will make me happy"".  My in-laws control through money, and my friend circle from 10 years ago have decided to stop bettering themselves, whereas i would be happy sailing the world in a bluewater sailboat - my wife is the most important thing in my life and decisions such as sailing the world is a 50/50 decision. These things happen all in due time ;) (type A personality here).

Small little backstory for those that are interested. I (24M) have been smoking for the past 10 years. Last week I took another one of my many attempts to try to kick the habit of smoking as an escape, release, celebration, or whatever other bullshit excuse I could come up with to smoke. I was three days in and had a mental breakdown feeling like I was unsure of myself and all of the decision I have been making and just wept on the phone to my mom about everything in my life, including this stupid leaf. After spilling out all of my insecurities and self doubt along with the supporting words from my mom (bless that women for putting up with all my bullshit I swear) I finally felt like a portion of the weight that I was using weed in hopes of getting rid of finally lifted. For the first time in a long time I felt like I sorted through my emotions and felt better about everything and my choice to quick. I had a new vigor to stay away from this drug and the following day (last Friday) I felt on top of the world and full of energy. I even went out to the local bookstore to get myself a book on a hobby as well as a small present as a thank you to my mom... thats when I got a call from one of my best friends from college who I used to smoke with daily. Now I haven't seen him in more then a year and turns out he was in the town next to me visiting another friend of mine who is also a stoner because he was picking up and hanging out for the day since he lives on the opposite side of the state as us. 

Heres where I fucked up. Stupidly I thought with new found strength and determination that I would be able to go over to spend some time with my friend and catch up on life, in my head I was in a place where I would have been able to say 'no.' Boy was I wrong. I stuck it out maybe close to 2 hours into the hangout but eventually the smell and atmosphere got to me and I smoked with them before I sat down to eat (my friends were very supportive and respectful of me not smoking and didnt try to pressure me into it just an fyi). But regardless I ended up breaking my streak that day, and because I did you know what I said like the idiot I am? 

""Well since I already broke my streak might as well just smoke the rest of the weekend and try again on Monday"" ... Well Monday rolled around and I caught some sickness thats been going around and STILL decided that smoking would help me feel better while I was sick even though it just left me more tired and anxious for doing it. And for some reason I kept smoking up until yesterday. 

Now I'm not sure what everyone view is here on religion but my family is Catholic and with yesterday being Ash Wednesday and the start of Lent, for the first time in years I decided to give up something  and thats this stupid habit. I haven't taken religion very seriously the past couple of years but its a huge part of my parents life so it just kind of felt like the right thing to do. And to prove the commitment this time around I took the weed that I bought over this weekend during my slip-up and FLUSHED THAT SHIT DOWN THE TOILET FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER! I wish I could sit here and tell you that the second it hit the toilet I felt relieved and like I made the right choice but I'll be honest the second those buds hit the toilet water my heart sank and I felt a wave of anxiousness wash over me and that disgusting whisper in the back of my head even thought about trying to grab them real quick to save them but instead I flushed them down the drain. I recorded this and sent it to my mother since she knows my struggle with this and just to show her and MYSELF that I'm committed to giving this drug and habit up for this Lent season.. and hopefully for the future after that. 

Anyway, I know this was a huge rant and I'm not expecting everyone to read this but if you do just know that I believe in you and I am rooting for you in your fight! God bless everyone and thank you for being part of this supportive community, I wish you all the strength in kicking this anxiety inducing, overindulging, motivation killing habit!

All that I am leaving of this habit is Ashes  


Tl;dr  
I had a mental breakdown about life on my third day of kicking the habit and on my fourth day of quitting an old college and smoking buddy came to visit where I slipped up. Because of that I went back to smoking everyday leading up to yesterday, and decided on Ash Wednesday I will be giving this habit up. Flushed the bud that I had left down the toilet and writing this post as a reminder to that commitment. All I am leaving of this habit is Ashes.",7

The third one is the good one.,"Day 1 was yesterday. Didn't smoke. Now on day 2, and I am alone so I know I will make it. The challenge will be day 3, because we spend Fridays with my boyfriend and he smokes. But yesterday he came and smoked and I just said no. I explained my plan to him, what I talked with my psychiatrist about the interaction with my drugs for bipolarity, and that I am doing this for a month to test the real effect of the drugs without the weed. If it works out, then I will obviously plan to quit forever. If it doesn't, I'll probably extend the test period for a second month, as I am pretty sure that I will feel better once I don't miss it any longer. Psychiatrist says the weed might be increasing my anxiety and irritability, and that it definitely affects my lack of motivation and initiative. So I would really like to see what I am like without smoking. I have been smoking every day for at least 4 years, and intermittently before that for at least 3 decades (I am 49).

Wish me luck!

I've decided to quit smoking weed. Maybe for good. Who knows. I just want to reach out to you all and let you know that you're all brave for deciding to quit something that creeps up on you. It's not addictive, but slowly things around your life become constricted. Time passes quicker. You start to lose motivation. Having the self awareness to quit is a brave and mature step. Maybe I'll take another hit in the future, but for now it's sober living. Time to get back in touch with myself again. ""Not right now"" is the new motto.",10

I'll do my best to give a breakdown of what I went through from week 1 until now.  And let's be clear I'm still battling some things but it's so much easier to handle which honestly I think that is just life. Life/Feelings we have been suppressing through weed and it hits like a Mac Truck when you stop.  

So after 16 years of smoking with the last 10 being pretty heavy I took my last puff on Thanksgiving. I was battling the flu so I didn't smoke for 4 days and figured this would be a great time to quit.  Financially it was keeping me from doing a lot of things.  Going on vacation.  Renovating my home. Buying an engagement 💍 for my lady. Etc.

Well the first week was hell.  Couldn't sleep, eat, or get comfortable. I was SO irritable the first few days. I would have fits of Rage. Slamming stuff around my house. I would sweat like none other while lying in bed shivering awake.  I literally thought i was dying. Thought to myself ""this can't be from the weed or lack there of"".  I mean everyone says it's none addictive right?? Wrong.  So I made a doctor's appointment and got blood work done just to make sure nothing serious was wrong with me.  Everything came back clear. At that point I realized I was experiencing marijuana withdraw. 

After a week or two my appetite came back and the sweating was gone. But I was starting to find I didn't know how to occupy my time.  Everything I once enjoyed while being high I had no interest in. I couldn't sit still. If I did immediately the anxiety and depression would set in. And this is until I would go to sleep in which the doctor gave me something to help me with that. It became annoying that I couldn't just relax and watch TV. This all went on for about a month until I decided to see a therapist. I will say that seeing a therapist helped out immensely.

Going into the second month the anxiety and depression really set in. I was finally sleeping again. But I was a ball of emotions. I would just start crying on my way to work for no reason. I would have to hide at work because I would feel so overwhelmed.  The second month though going into the Third was by far the worst as far as depression and anxiety. I was literally suffering from GAD.  Generalized anxiety disorder.  I couldn't listen to music on the radio. Couldn't even watch TV. Everything and anything gave me anxiety. Felt like I couldn't talk to people anymore. Not to mention I was battling intrusive thoughts. Some of them suicidal. Some of them just disgusting. This is when I started to exercise. Specifically running. My therapist told me by getting my heart rate up for at least 10 minutes a day would help out with everything.  Also my doctor recommended a book called ""FEELING GOOD THE NEW MOOD THETAPY"" by David D. Burns M.D. to battle the depression. Anywho I bought a pair of good running shoes and started off small.  Running hardly a mile at first.  Today I'm up to 3 and a half.  While running and throughout the day I keep telling myself and reminding myself why I quit.  I wrote down all the reasons why i quit and wrote down the reason why I should go back to smoking (which the cravings were crazy.)  You'd be surprised with your results.  But anytime the craving would hit or the anxiety/depression seemed to be much I would take off running and push myself.  Have you every heard of a runners high? It's a real thing and it lasts for a few hours. Getting your heart rate up through any type of aerobic exercise releases endorphins and dopamine in the brain which put you in a euphoric state of mind kind of like weed.

As I started to going into month three it seemed the extreme depression and anxiety started to wear away. I know it's still there, but nothing like it was. What was once an all day feeling only comes in waves now and I'm starting to learn how to combat it.  That inner voice in your head will be your worst enemy. You just have to learn how to battle it with reasonable thinking. And eventually you will start having more reasonable thoughts which lead to more reasonable actions.

Today was the first day I have seen my dealer in a long time. I still owed him a little bit of money from 3 months ago. I was so tempted to get a sack off of him. But I combated that thought and told myself no. I've come this far. Why would I disappoint myself? And like I said I'm not in the clear. Maybe it's just the weather but I'm finding it extremely hard to find things I enjoy doing other than running. I'm still working on my motivation to get things done. I just have to keep telling myself "" I can. I will. I must.""  It's tough. But if you are determined you can get through this. Get up. Move around. Become comfortable with the uncomfortable. Remind yourself that this isn't forever because I guarantee you it's not. I'm sure every single one of you knows a person who is legitimately happy with their life and is never touched cannabis. Do you ever ask yourself "" how are they so happy without having to indulge in any sort of substance?""  Where you always sad before you started smoking? No. You weren't. We will get back to a true happiness without having a fogged reality.  You don't want to let the years slip away and next thing you know you're in your sixties thinking to yourself "" wow I have been high for 40 + years.""  

This is life. You only have one to live. Make the best of it. And when you start feeling like s*** remember that this is not forever. You must go through bad times so later on in life you can enjoy the good ones.  Don't be afraid to talk to somebody about it either. Therapist. Your family. Someone. In my first few weeks of sobriety that seemed to help more than anything and I'm so grateful to have a supporting mother and father. If you don't have somebody to talk to about it I will always have an open ear. Message me and we can talk it out. This isn't just a forum. It is a community.

Love you Leavers.

2020-02-27 18:20:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fakzgb/im_at_the_end_of_my_rope/,I'm at the end of my rope.," Hi people of r/leaves, thank you for being there. This is an awesome sub.

So I quit vaping weed last October. It was just taking up too much of my life, the joy had turned into anxiety and I was addicted. I kept making up excuses not to quit. I was vaping every night without fail and when I wasn't high, I was thinking of getting high. But I did quit, first took a few long breaks and now it's been something like 4 months. (I made a decision not to count days, because it seemed like a ""softer"" way to do it) Initially I was unsure whether I just want a break or to quit entirely, but the more distance I get, the more clearly I see that it was just making my life worse.

It's been going pretty well. I'm smarter and more creative and no longer need to hide myself and my habit from people. I've done a lot of soul-searching and I feel like a slightly new person. I'm beginning to trust myself again.

But this year hasn't been easy. I'm working part time while studying, two different jobs. One of them is nice, the other sucks ass and drains my soul but I don't dare quit because I don't have anything else lined up. So between the jobs and school, I do super long days and still have very little money. Still, it's been worth it because I think I'm headed in the right direction. And I couldn't have done this if I was high half the time. But this is super exhausting. I've been looking for a better job but this far it's been all stress and no luck.

To make things worse, my physical health has been shit. I had a minor surgery in the end of December, and then there have been complications and unrelated issues that just never seem to end. Just as I was getting better, I got another infection, spent 5 hours in the emergency room yesterday, and now I'm back on strong antibiotics that make me sick before they (hopefully) make me better.

On top of everything, I found out yesterday that a relative of mine is dying soon, they have stopped his cancer treatments and he's gone home to be comfortable in his last... weeks I guess? Or maybe months. And one of my best friends just found out she has a pretty serious chronic illness. And my dear old cat is 15 and on more or less palliative care, I might lose him any time.

I have two super important deadlines on Saturday, and I haven't been able to do anything about them for two days. And a preliminary job interview tomorrow, and another school deadline on Monday. I guess I'll lower my standards. I can probably make it.

I guess I'm just so tired of being good. I've taken my meds, cared for my wounds, seen my doctors, worked on my sleep schedule, gone to work, put in the schoolwork, lived on as little money as possible, talked to friends, tried to take a day off here and there, and tried to be super kind to myself because I KNOW this is a pretty demanding time. Stayed sober. Stayed optimistic and constructive. Yet despite all this effort, here I am, still sick, still broke, exhausted, anxious, worried, and lonely.

I just want to not care about all the stuff for a while. I want to raise a big middle finger to the whole world and say fuck it, keep your rules, I'm out for a while. And I don't know how to do that without weed.

So, uh, thanks if you read all of this. Any support or alternative middle-finger ideas are appreciated.",9

I dont know, for 3-4 days I've been getting into these arguments with my SO over things that have been way in the back of my mind for the last 2-3 years (both regular smokers up until 14 days). The things that WHERE in the back of my mind I considered trivial, almost cute, as a token of our diferent personalities somehow working together.  And now I keep questioning our whole relationship. Since day 1 cannabis has been a mutual habit of ours, and now that its gone I almost feel like we are losing touch with eachother.   


It's as if alot of problems between us, differences, have been emerging to the surface once we are sober. And I cant separate what is real and not between us. Did cannabis just put a lid on these merging problems or is it my ""crank-levels"" that have been turned way up? Sure, my mood varies a bit more now that im sober, but I have this nagging feeling that a veil has been lifted.  


Im 30 male, and shes 34 female, so its not like we have all the time in the world to fool around.

It's been six months since I quit smoking. I don't have a day count but my last time smoking was back in August 2019. I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dkaub3/its_been_2_months_this_time_is_different/) after two months of quitting and I was feeling relatively positive about quitting. In the months that followed, I basically got to the point where I never even really thought about weed. I was just going about my life and kind of just left it behind in the past. No cravings, no urges, nothing.

About a week or two ago something triggered me to start thinking about smoking again. I can't really pinpoint a specific circumstance or moment that made me start thinking about it again. I think at first it was just a passing thought and then it became more frequent. As I look back over these past 6 months, I don't see any major changes in my life like I was expecting. Of course there have been minor changes. I picked up habits of eating healthier, doing yoga and exercising more often. 

I think I blamed weed for a lot of the problems that I have had throughout my life. I have suffered with anxiety and depression since I was about 14. I started smoking weed daily when I was 19 and in the beginning thought it was helping me with these things. After years of smoking, and despite going to therapy, I still suffered with these problems. One of my therapists had suggested that perhaps weed was making my problems worse and that it was messing with my brain chemistry. After hearing that I think that thought stuck with me and I started thinking weed was a big part of my problem. As I mentioned in my post from a few months ago, I had short periods of sobriety and sometimes things were looking up, but then I'd start smoking again. Whether the weed made my problems worse or not I'm not really sure anymore, I'm starting to think it's just ME.. I'm just a depressed/anxious/non-social person. I thought that after 6 months, I was really going to see some great progress in my life, but I really haven't. 

I've been thinking about smoking again, not because it's necessarily going to make things better but because it's kind of like an old hobby that I miss. Perhaps this is just how an addicted mind works though, but I just wonder why? Why now? After six months, and about 3-4 of those months I rarely, if ever, even thought about weed. There were a few times where I saw it on TV or I talked to a friend on Facetime who was smoking or something and it didn't bother me and I just didn't really even think anything of it. Has anyone else had this kind of experience before? Any advice?

I just needed to get this out and hope to get some support from the community.",7

I started smoking weed as a teen with friends, sometimes skipping school to get high, but not often.  Then I got to college.  I started smoking more often, at least once or twice a week, still just with friends though.  Then came moving into my first apartment (shared with roommates) and all the freedom of living away from parents and off of school property.  I got myself my very own bong that year... and that's when everything started to change.

I began smoking daily, after work at first, then eventually in the morning before breakfast but hours before my nighttime work shifts.  When I was 22 I met my ex, D\*, and fell in love hard and fast.  He smelled of cannabis and coffee (we worked at starbucks together) and I loved it.  He was a weed dealer (back in the days before dispensaries were standard in Toronto) and smoked daily as well.  I was always high when we were together.  I started smoking at all times of day regardless of when I worked, and being high became my normal.

Two years later, D\* broke my heart, and I didn't want to feel anything.  I started smoking much higher THC levels and more often, I relied heavily on cannabis to numb my negative emotions. These emotions of mine are very intense, as I have Borderline Personality Depression and ADHD.  Being high made me less reactionary, less anxious, more... comfortable.

It's been 3 years since that breakup and despite multiple attempts at ""cutting back"" ""lowering my usage"" or ""quitting"".. I haven't been successful.

I am dependent. I spend all my time thinking about the next chance I'll have to smoke, I don't socialize unless I can be high, I don't allow myself to run out of weed even if it means going without groceries. I am terrified of the idea that I should quit for good and forever, but I know I can't go on like this.

I'm lonely. I'm lethargic. My memory is hard to access. I've no motivation to do anything other than smoking weed. I'm late for work often (a job I love!) because I just can't motivate myself to be on time for anything ever.  I've gained a LOT of weight and never have enough energy to exercise.  I'm numb and haven't cried in over a year despite experiencing sad and even traumatic events in that time.

I recently had a Psychiatric consult because I thought these struggles were linked to my medications (anti-depressant, mood stabiliser) and wanted to try a different medication for the first time since going on antidepressants. The psychiatric team I consulted with diagnosed me with Cannabis Use Disorder, and explained that due to the amount I've been smoking, every day, for years now, while my brain still developed and while I also struggle with BPD - that it has caused long term effects on my cognitive functions and mood.  They told me that it would be pointless to change my medication without me actually making a change in my cannabis consumption and addressing this addiction.

&#x200B;

So here I am. Going to an Addictions Clinic next Wednesday, looking for support here, and tomorrow night, I am going to go to my first Marijuana Anonymous meeting (very lucky that I live in Toronto and there are options every weekday here)  But I'm scared. I don't know what's coming. I don't know how to accept this new reality.  I don't know what to do to occupy my time as nothing seems to make me as happy as smoking weed does. Nothing calms my mind the way smoking does.

So there's my story, I'm taking the first steps towards quitting, and I'm terrified.",314

I'm 12 days into quitting a multi-year habit. With the exception of a 2.5 stint in the Peace Corps, I've been a regular smoker for at least 18 years. It's been helpful to keep the focus on one week at a time rather than the idea of forever. I don't know if I'm even ready to accept that I'm fully quitting forever. I'm hoping with more clean days under my belt it will seem easier.

I think a big difficulty for me right now is the fact that, despite this strong habit, it hasn't really affected my life negatively. I have a successful career, a wide group of friends, a strong and loving relationship with my partner. It's all about how I perceive my own individual relationship to weed. In those times of feeling challenged by this process, I find myself rationalizing—wondering what the big deal is with smoking a little weed each day when by all other life-metrics I'm doing great. I don't have an answer for this yet.

The other thing I'm having trouble with is—surprise, surprise—I enjoy it. It's sort of sad thinking giving up something that I enjoy so much. And, in the midst of these early days, I'm \*not\* feeling so happy, and very few things seem to make me happy at this moment in time.

What has been helpful is reading the experiences of others in this process. I don't know why I couldn't realize for myself that mood swings, feeling low, appetite swings (I've been feeling \*ravenous\*), etc are withdrawal symptoms. It's been super helpful in those moments to read them in others and realize it for myself.

Anyways, thank you for all your posts. Looking forward to Day 13+ and congrats to everyone else on this journey.",8

I've been grazing this sub for probably the past year or so and it's finally time to make this post. I've been recreationally smoking for close to ten years with a couple of breaks. The first time I smoked was with a good friend on plain night hanging out after the gym. Over the years it really became involved into my everyday lifestyle before school, before the gym, before work and then after any of those activities. Everything just seemed better with mary. Next, I met my girlfriend online and we had similar interest including weed. I never actually sold much but she kept putting me off, so one day I told her I did. She drover close to an hour to pick it, but that was her only interest. Trying to impress her, I gave her some really awesome stuff for great price and acted like it was nothing. Long story short were we've been together 10 years, currently married and expecting our first child. What happened next changed everything. I was 21 years old and it was after midnight when we received a knock on the door from the sheriff's department. He said, ""I regret to inform you, but your younger brother is in ICU after car accident and is currently on life support"". Everyone freaked out, I remember my father shrieking frantically around house before we headed to the hospital. My brother never regained consciousness or showed any signs of life. This was definitely one of the worsts days of my life. After my brother passed my family fell apart and I medicated everything with mary jane. Fast forward a year or two, I Just graduated, started working and wasn't smoking for a decent amount of time.  I changed jobs a couple times some and of environments weren't the best for someone to abstain. Then I finally found a job I really enjoyed, and everything in life seemed good. It was one of the first times that I didn't care about mary at all. What happened next really took the wind out of my sails. My best friend, gym partner, previous co-worker, and life long friend of the family is stricken with cancer at 26. This one was tough. His battle was short, horrific, and he passed within 6 months. This one I'm still recovering from, but that's life. I've come to realize that I've been running from my emotions with mary and that I really need to face these problems head on.  It's been difficult, but I've never really asked anyone for support on this matter, so I'm hoping this helps. Here's to a proud Day 1!

I'm thinking it's my body healing but I slept a solid 10 hours today! I'd like to sort out my sleeping pattern now, it's not fun waking up at 4 PM and sleeping at 6 AM. I'm not sure the best way to go about that, I figured if I just stay up a little longer each day I'll come full circle! But I'm not going to let that get me down, all is well! Keep on keeping on and I'll check in again tomorrow! :)",8

This past year ive smoked every day it was i thought that i can manage until i bought a bong. For a year ive smoked bong everyday. Things got bad. Now i only smoke bongs joints dont satisfy me.Tge problem with bongs that they are 1-very efficient 2-very easy 3-very strong. I wake up in the ready to start tge day energetic then i take a hit and the day fuckes up. 

 Weed took from my life more than it gave me. I used to be a judo player plus going to the gyn daily, I lost 7 kgs in a year.My nutrition is bad now I used to be healthy really healthy. Now i just dont care. Pot just makes you dont care about anything. Makes you antisocial. Makes you unproductive. Dispite all that I smoke  daily. Idk why i know that if a take a hit in the morning the day will be fucked, yet i do it every day. Even if i try to resist not smoking I always give myself an excuse to smoke.

My problem with weed that from the all stoners I am exceptional in a thing. I reallly love weed. My room has smoking rules. ex 1) pass on left 2)ashe before you pass 3)equal hits and much more. I make sure i do them right. Apart from tgat im the only one in unu that actually cleans bongs I buy rubbing alcohol and clean all my friends bongs. I do it because I have a passion. For example in rolling joints I always try to improve learn new things,New methods of rolling. Now I roll any type of J and still learning. You cant stop learning.Even with bong hits I take each hit in perfection i take myvtime with tge hit I dont rush. My problem in my prefection and passion for weed. weed is really holding me back in alot of things did not see tge effects back then, but now i see them.
The problem of quitting is that my uni is basically in the forest nothing to do ligit nothing its very far fron tge center tge only thing to do is weed. what will i do in my free time. My room mate is a stoner weed is very cheap 10g for 10 usd. Everywhere is weed my uni has a very strong smoking community because every one lives on campus and cant go to the city easily.All of my stoner friends dont want to stop. They don't even encourage you. No one wants to stoo. people just want to have fun without thinking of tommorow. 
 I wish i can find somthing to give it the passion i give weed. Another thing i wanted to add i am an ex cigarette smoker. I stopped cigarettes by reading this book ""The easy wasy to stop smoking"" recommended if you are trying to stop. Its very effective. Since I stopped cigarettes the fact that i cant stop weed if fucking me.
Sorry tge post is long this is my first time sharing.",3

My mobile phone and social media were completely consuming my life. I was in an emotional rock-bottom, and the iPhone was my escape, my distraction, my companion…

On Thursday night (20/2/2020), a wave of inspiration struck. It was time to do a serious cleanse, and see what difference it made on me mentally. I decided to do a bunch of daily habits, and see if I could climb out of this mental rut.

Now, I want to share my experience with you guys, and explain why I’m going to keep my phone turned off - quite possibly for good.

So…I turned off my phone and got my girlfriend to put passwords on the website blocker on my computer.

Each day, I decided to get up at 6 am and go through a morning routine, consisting of:

* 10 minutes of coffee and water
* 10 minutes of meditation
* 10 minutes affirmation
* 10 minutes visualising my perfect day
* 10 minutes writing 10 goals
* 10 minutes stretching
* 60 minutes gym workout

I also committed to a daily massage for 60 minutes, where I would use that 60 minutes to meditate, and to journal every day and plan my following day.

I wrote all these tasks down on my whiteboard and went to sleep.

Now, I want to share 3 key things that happened with you. One will be the cravings, one will be the benefits and one will be about what happened after I turned on my phone and Facebook again…

**Cravings**

Now, I have defeated many addictions throughout my life. Alcohol, weed, nicotine, cocaine and so on. I know what a craving is and I have had a lot of experience dealing with them.

Interestingly, I felt INTENSE cravings. Let me try and explain it…

When I say a craving, it wasn’t the feeling of missing the phone or checking social media. It was the anticipation that one day, I’ll be able to check my messages and see all the people that have tried to get in touch with my because I have only been accessible through e-mail.

That would literally flood my body with adrenaline and dopamine. The exact same feeling used to happen when I would think of, say, a cigarette.

This was really interesting. I knew I was addicted to my smartphone and social media, but I didn’t think the intense feelings would be the same as a drug.

Obviously, this feeling is very hard to manage, but I got through it fine.

**Benefits**

I want to list a number of benefits that I have found from stopping. I’m not sure whether the benefits have come from stopping social media and the smartphone, or the habits and morning routine I have been doing. I think it’s a combination.

* I am more present than I have ever been in my life. I think this is partly down to no phone, and partly down to the meditation/massage. I enjoy the gaps and moments of silence in between thoughts more than ever.
* I am better at impulse control. Before, any time I had a thought or an idea, I’d immediately Google it or message someone about it. Now, without being able to grab my phone, I can’t do that. This has spread into other areas of life.
* Productivity has been sky high. I’ve been creating more content than I ever have before, and the quality has been great.
* I have been way more focussed. I am able to focus on the task at hand without distraction.
* Work has been more enjoyable. Because I am fully immersed in the moment, I enjoy work a lot more.

**Turning On Facebook on Day 7**

I turned on Facebook last night to market a video I created yesterday, to try and get some leads for a lead magnet I created. I also wanted to assign 3 members to a Facebook group I own to become moderators, so I don’t need to police it. What happened was quite interesting…

I had been emotionally building up to the day where I could check my messages, the same way I’d build up to taking a drink/drug. I was excited. So, I unblocked Facebook, and I immediately felt myself get sucked into it all. I was only supposed to go on it for 15 minutes, but then 30 minutes went by, then 45…I was mindful of what was going on…

So I finished what I had to do, sent the messages that needed responding to and blocked it again. I had been emotionally excited to see the messages, and after blocking it, I felt an anti-climax. I felt slightly deflated. The exact same way I would feel after finally having a drink, or a cigarette, or a drug.

I know I sound like I’m exaggerating the impact it had, but the difference in how I felt mentally was really this extreme.

I then sat down to write my journal and plan today. My mind was all over the place. The last week, I have been more present and in the “now” than I ever have, but my mind was so busy after turning it off. I started writing the journal, and half way through I just wanted to give up and not bother planning tomorrow.

**Conclusion**

So, I’ve blocked Facebook and turned off my phone once again…

Honestly, I could not recommend doing this experiment enough to other people.

I have journaled every single day, and I feel as though this is one of the most beneficial things I have done in my adult life.

I did not realise the extent of my problem until I got rid of it.",43

Hello community,

First of all I wanna say thanks to all of you who post so we can cope with it. This helped a lot to me, somehow I know I am not alone and it's much easier to go through.Here is a short report:

Day 1 - Everything looks fine until evening when my heart start pulsating which gave me panic attacks that continued to day 2-3 when I decided to look for a help and found this group.Day 2,3,4 - Small panic attacks which gave me neck squeezing and that scared me a lot, exhaustion, anxiety skyrocket, I was scared to be home alone so I went outside and walk all day long to get my self tired so I could sleep easier.

Day 5,6,7 - Anxiety and depression went down a bit but was still there, day 7 which was yesterday and I felt so so exhausted after coffee and that gave me small panic attack and my left side of neck start squeezing again so I decided to visit doctor to check my pressure and heart. Results were great and since I heard that I felt relieved and panic went away.

Last night I had dream my friend gave me full bag of weed like I never saw before. I brought it home and I next scene I remember is that I woke up (in dream) and start rolling my blunt and than I realised I decided to quit smoking so I threw it away :)",1
2020-02-27 07:44:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fabk2p/when_smoking_is_affecting_someone_you_love/,When Smoking is Affecting Someone You Love,"This post is for anybody who is struggling to quit weed, and that struggle is affecting a loved one, whether it be a friend, a partner, or a child. I intend to share my story and hope that at least one person benefits from it.

My girlfriend and I have known each other for two years. Before we got together, I knew smoking was a problem for me and that I would eventually have to quit if I wanted to accept better things into my life. As we started to get more serious, I knew I would have to cut back on weed and fill my time with more productive things so I could be in a healthier space to be in a relationship. however I did not prioritize this growth, and continued to use weed heavily after we got together. Over time, the effects started to catch up and it was apparent from how she felt that I was neglecting the relationship. She felt like I was distant, like I wouldn't listen to her. My mood was sporadic and I made our communication difficult by not being in a clear head space to make good decisions or have a mature conversation. I knew I would lose her if I didnt get it together, but I just couldn't seem to. granted, with her I have spent more sober days than i ever have. She does encourage me to be better. But expecting her to give her all to me while I am not giving my all to her is unfair and selfish. I cannot tell her or myself that I would never do anything to hurt her, but when I'm high I hurt her by not being fully present in the moment and making her feel unheard. 

It is a priority to me to treat my girl the best way I can, because my past relatsionship I was not a decent partner and I didnt want to hurt another person like that again. but I cannot continue to lie to myself that I am doing my best to ensure the success of the relationship if I am sabotaging it by smoking weed. The truth is, if I smoke, I'm more likely to not be a good partner. I'm more likely to not be present and make her feel like I don't care and like I don't listen. I'm more likely to be sneaky and dishonest about what I'm doing, because I dont want her to know that I sit and smoke all day. I'm more likely to be a bad communicator because my head is not clear. Therefore the honest truth is if I am choosing to smoke weed, I am choosing against building my relationship up. Instead, it is a conscious choice to tear it down.

Sobering up is the hardest thing I never thought I would have to do. But no matter how hard it is, I know it will be harder to see my girlfriend walk away from me because she doesn't want to put up with feeling like she's second to my smoking habit. Or like I wont get it together to become a healthy adult and provider in our future relationship/marriage.

If you hide when you smoke, its being dishonest and whether its about weed or anything else, lying or going behind your loved ones back is unacceptable.

If your habit is affecting your relationships, I urge you: don't lie to yourself. Don't allow yourself to think you are being the best partner/parent/friend if you know weed does not let you be the best you that you can be in that relationship. Instead, know that being the best you comes with seeing your goals through and giving your energy to things that fill you instead of drain you of life. If that comes with giving up weed, then you know what you have to do.",21
2020-02-27 07:01:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fab2k2/my_reason_to_stay_sober_today_day_1/,My Reason to Stay Sober Today- Day 1,"I've written a lengthy list about all of my reasons to stay sober a couple of times before. I am very well aware of all the reasons, and this time I am not going to write out a list (at least yet). The previous times I've tried to quit were unsuccessful because when I'm high and feel dumb and over it, it's easy to say ""screw this I don't want to feel like this."" But as soon as I come down, its ""ugh being sober is hard I don't want to feel like this I want to smoke."" I realized that I can't make the decision to stay sober for the days to come, today. The decision has to be made over and over and over, each and every day. You can only decide and act in the now.  It will overwhelm you to try and control what you will be doing tomorrow, right now. So this time, every day I wake up I will think of a reason to stay sober just for that day. And each time I get the craving I will remind myself of my reason. For some reason, thinking of the bigger picture is such as ""I will feel so much better in 30 days when I realize how far I've come,"" does not encourage me to stay sober. So I have to think of something that will encourage me and get me through TODAY.

Today, I am staying sober because this evening, my girlfriend and I are going to an event together, and it totally affects our interactions when I smoke. When I'm high, I am more socially awkward and I make her uncomfotable. We get into arguments because my energy is so off. I make her feel like I am not listening to her because its hard for me to keep up and I forget what was said right after it was said. She feels like she cant talk to me so she resorts to scrolling through her phone. Also, when I smoke and we get home, soon as I hit the bed I fall asleep on her. Which sucks because we have different schedules with work and school so anytime we see each other I just want to enjoy her company, but I am too high and gassed out to do so.

Today, I don't want it to be that way. I know even if I smoke hours before, it will still affect me later and I will go into the evening groggy. So today, I am staying sober so I can have an enjoyable time with my girlfriend tonight. I want to bring good energy and have fun with her without making things awkward. She's my best friend I love spending time with her and I just do not want to step in the way of having the best time we can tonight. She has been so patient with me through this journey, and I want to value her effort by putting in effort myself to making sure I am building myself to be the best me I can be. 

What is your reason for staying sober today?",11

I haven't even quit smoking weed entirely yet, but the dreams are really shaking me up. I have been cutting back quite a bit lately, and I just woke up from terrifying nightmares that have made me afraid to go back to sleep.

To provide some context, I'm in the middle of making a giant move across the country alone, leaving all of my family behind. 
So, clearly, this is an emotional time all around.

The only problem is, for years I've been anhedonic and numb, partly due to the amount of weed I have smoked to cope with my emotions and suppress my past traumas. I'm used to micro-analyzing my emotions without ACTUALLY feeling them.

I'm also incredibly used to not dreaming, or rather, not remembering my dreams when I wake up. So I'm no longer sure how to deal with nightmares. 

Any advice would be helpful at this point",0

Should I go workout while high, it makes my workout better. When can I get high so I can enjoy x, y and z?

I look back and wish I would have stayed the sweet, innocent girl I used to be. I used to be super anti marijuana and now look at me, 6 years later...I can’t seem to get away from it. 

All my friends smoke. And they always offer to smoke me out for free. Even when I offer to pay, they decline as if it’s no big deal. Secretly, I wish they would ask me for money so I’d have an excuse NOT to smoke. “Nah, I’m trying to save money right now” is exactly what I would’ve said. But no, every time it’s “don’t worry about it”.

But again, it’s day zero and I’m really trying to assess how I’m going to get rid of this in my life. I’m scared but I’m curious to see how I feel in one week or fifteen days. If I can get past to 30 days, I’d be so proud of myself!",3

A month ago I purged all that I had, threw out all of my accessories and went for it. Many days have sucked, but each day it feels easier. I’ve even started working out again and eating better.

I have smoked every day for 18 years. I started at uni, and just carried on habitually ever since. I would get up in the morning, roll a zoot for breakfast, and that would set the precedent for the rest of the day. I have always worked in hospitality, and found that over time I was able to function normally whilst under the influence, and it just became the norm. I would smoke in my splits, smoke just before work, no repurcussions. So I never stopped.

But in recent years, I haven't felt right. My appetite is all over the place. I have a mild form of Cannibanoid Hyperemesis, and spend half an hour most mornings overcoming severe bouts of nausea, which is a horrible way to start the day, but I managed it with fizzy drinks and Rennie. Yeah, I know. Sounds weird.

The last few months have been somewhat traumatic in both my personal and business life. I had to close my business, and am dealing with the repurcussions of that, including finding a new home for my mother. I have, as a result, started a new job, and am dealing with being employed by someone else for the first time in my life. The mixture of stress caused by this massive change, irregular dietary habits caused by the intensity of my work hours, and a couple of bouts of sickness lately, that rendered me useless for a few days, has made my anxiety levels shoot through the roof, and this has had major effects on both my already dodgy appetite and my day to day performance both at work, and as a regular functioning human being.

I'm exhausted, I feel ill, and the pot makes everything worse, whether I care to admit it out loud or not. I also have a 5 year old son who deserves a father who is not a fucking drug addict. With this new job, which I love, and the stresses of my former career behind me, my future is too bright for me to allow the weed to continue to control me. If ever there was an excuse for a fresh start, it's now.

So I prepared myself. I read your accounts, I soaked up the positivity, I prepared myself mentally, I wound down the amount I smoked, and last night, I ran out of green.

Today, for the first time I can remember, I got up and got ready for work without smoking anything! I went to work, came home in my split, walked the dog WITHOUT taking a joint with me, went back to work, did great, came home, poured myself a glass of wine... Nothing. No desire for a joint. I've convinced myself this is it. I am ready to change my life forever.

I'm so excited.

Thank you all for this sub. You inspired me, and will continue to inspire me.

Today I have decided to quit smoking marijuana. This is something I have done in the past but obviously haven't stuck to considering i'm writing this post now. It's kind of embarrassing to even be writing this tbh, but I don't really feel comfortable talking to anyone about this face to face. I've been smoking since I was probably about 16-17, and haven't really stopped since and I am 24 now. Marijuana has literally impacted my life in such a negative way that I can only imagine where I'd be had I not started. I don't want to turn this post into a ""oh woe is me"" situation because I know I got myself into this and I need to get myself out. However, I feel like I need somewhere to write down my thoughts to just get it out and receive some feedback. I don't have anyone I feel I could confide in about this irl, and I don't want to see a therapist and have some documentation stating I have a drug problem. I could go on with this post and keep bitching, but I'm going to cut it here and write this sentence as a statement of my definite purpose to quit using marijuana. Today is the last day I will use marijuana, because I am realizing more and more every day it is causing my life to become out of control.

I started smoking in the beginning of freshmen year when I was 14. I was immediately hooked and it became something I’d do every single weekend. It was also almost always black market carts. Once a week turned into twice a week, twice a week turned into thrice a week, and so on until I was smoking every day for a couple months straight. 


It was around this time last winter that I began to realize that even when sober, I felt super foggy and still “high”. Definitely not like how I remember being sober to be. I was missing that clarity. I tuned it down a bit in the spring and took a month off in May. But then I caved and went back to smoking everyday in the Summer, because it’s harmless right? This school year I’ve been consistently smoking a couple times a week with a week long bender here and there up until a week ago.

I don’t feel sober even though I am. Reality and my vision constantly seems like a dull high. It’s so frustrating because I faintly remember what it felt like to have clarity and I’m terrified that I have done permanent damage, especially since it’s been all carts. I decided to quit cold turkey last week not only because of how foggy I feel 24/7, but I’m afraid that I will stunt my growth (I’m only 5’ 4” and still have to hit my growth spurt). I also realized I was using weed to cope with a breakup rather than facing it head on. 

I am genuinely worried that I have done permanent damage not only to my final height, but to my brain. Last time I took a month off, the fogginess did not fade at all by the end of the month. My memory is noticeably worse and sometimes I struggle to remember what I was thinking about just a few moments ago. I wish I could go back in time and never take that first hit. I just want to feel sober again. Any thoughts or advice?",4

I should feel good right? Well..........I don’t. I’m a nervous wreck and have no idea what to do. I’m incredibly stressed out about the whole thing.  

 Technically I’ve already accepted a position but the others might be more appealing than that one.  The job I’ve currently accepted pays a bit less but has more security while one other pays significantly more with less job security. I’d also be working for someone I’ve worked for before and have a good reputation with. The third one has the security and more room for growth than the first but I don’t have a firm offer from that one yet. 

 Now I’m in a situation where I know I’m going to have to burn at least one of them to take the other.  I know I should be stoked and that having choices is a good thing but I still feel fucking horrible. I haven’t been this stressed in months and all I want to do right now is light up.

When I smoke, the initial high just gets me stuck in anxious thought loops, stuck deep in my head, and everytime I ask myself why I keep doing this. The blissful relaxation after the initial panic just isn't worth it.

The first time around, I was only aiming for 14 days of sobriety, and then i’d smoke and try to increase the break each consecutive time after that. However, I’m back because that never worked, and I finally realize two years later that its time for me to let go of weed for sure. I’ve been depressed and wasting life for too long, and this post is me looking for help. I don’t know who else to turn to, so Im gonna go a bit into details about my depression. If you want a shorter version: 

TLDR- I’m 21 years old, and I have been smoking since I was 14. Very soon I developed a dependence on it all through high school. now I’m a senior in college. I have no solid friend group, recovering from shitty grades, stopped pursuing all of my talents, and instead wasted my whole college life smoking and being depressed. I feel like a failure as I accomplished 10% of the things I wanted to do while in college. I want to give up weed for good and change my life but it is hard cause every time i come down and i’m sober i cant focus on anything else but weed and the paralyzing depression of not being accomplished. Literally any advice would be appreciated.Thanks in advance.

Three days before my 14th birthday I took my first hit, and I didn’t know after that my life would change forever. I became more complacent as I grew more and more dependent on weed. I think my heavy usage stemmed from a depressing home life. For a couple years in high school I was uncomfortable in my own home due to my sexuality and having religious parents. There were many arguments and days we didn’t speak. I felt like I wasn’t wanted in my own home and I couldn’t be myself. On the flip side my friends were my angels. I loved being with them and we all smoked all the time. Still we were good high school students, we were the group of kids leading every club and on honor roll. This is why I didnt think weed was an issue. It wasnt until college where I had realized that high school was just easy for me, and I didnt develop skills to perservere when things were actually rough. 

Actually, a month before school started I decided to stop smoking. This was because my one dream as a kid was to play my sport in college. I was sober a month and a half before try outs. Then I tried out I didnt make it, and I went straight to the weed man and lit up. Recently I realized that was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. 

It was after this my grades started to decline. I would rarely go to class. Luckily first year was all GE classes, so I still passed with low effort. As the courses got harder I started to fail exams and get subpar grades. Freshman and sophomore year I had friends and I went to social events. however eventually I stopped hanging out with people and going to events to focus on school. However looking back I dont think I focused on school because my grades were still shitty. Mainly I was smoking and skipping class to have conversations with myself about how bad I felt and how I needed to get it together. I was always high. Always sleep. Always wasting time.

I ended junior year on academic probation and a 1.7 gpa. Then a couple months later my cousin passed away. It just seemed like any time things would get better something would knock me off my feet. I knew at this point I should try to stop smoking because I was approaching senior year, and my 21st birthday, and I couldn’t live like this forever. However, I just couldnt/cant seem to stop. Im just so tired of being tired. I feel like Im drowning and Im tired of gasping for air. I have a girlfriend, I love her so much. but i know if I don’t change my habits eventually we wont work out because I am not living like a productive member of society. She’s everything. She gets great grades she’s a dancer she’s everything. I always go to her events but deep down I hate how it makes me feel that theres no events I have that she can come support me. I have nothing to show for myself. I’m trying a bit more in school but Im going to graduate a year later which also has been stressing me out. I have no friends. When we go to events I see everybody being so passionate about their talents and I feel like a loser since I stopped pursuing mine. I feel so lame and unaccomplished. i actually feel like a loser when 5 years ago I was probably the most confident person walking around. On my campus I feel like I dont belong. Like everyone is doing what they want walking around alive and I am a zombie of a person. My room is a mess. I cant keep it clean, dishes and clothes everywhere. sometimes I don’t shower for days straight. I live like a slob. I cant seem to pick myself up.

Im in the space where I want to move forward. I’ve had more Day 1s this current school year than I’ve ever had. i keep trying but I dont want to try. i just want to do it and stop feeling shitty. im tired of being depressed I feel like I have been depressed all my life. I wish I was living my best life, going to the gym, relearning all my passions, dedicating time to my sport, succeeding in school and meeting new people. Its just hard because every time I sober up, everything that I haven’t accomplished rushes to my head. It makes me feel so bad and so I have a giant urge to smoke. its a cycle, you know that. I sober up to shitty grades, insecurities, fears, a sloppy room, no talents, and feeling like a loser. And a big overwhelming regret that I’m about to graduate college without playing my sport collegiately. I just feel like I suck, and life sucks. But i want to move forward. I just dont know how I’m supposed to. 

Now after writing all of that I still want to smoke. How do I say “Im done with weed” and MEAN IT!!?! Ugh. Any words of advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",6

Every time I tried to follow a routine with series of exercises at home, it never lasted long.

If this sounds familiar to you, start small, the smallest you can. Do 5 push-ups throughout the day, that's it, but do it. Go for a 10 minute walk every single day, but do it. If you're depressed or have low motivation for whatever reason, start small, make small goals, but reach them.

I've been in this mindset for some weeks now, the longest I've ever lasted exercising. Every day I feel I want to do more, I feel the lack of it if I don't, as little as I am doing as of now, I can see that I've been progressing, I want to do 10 push-ups now, because 5 seems like too little.

Long walks help a lot when you don't bring pot along, if they are long enough, or better yet, up hill, you will probably have less need to smoke when you come home.

Heres what ive experienced","For me i started smoking because i was a freshman in high school and it was the socially ""cool"" thing to do, but i diddnt want to just do it to be cool so i sort of claimed the lifestyle as my own, My thought was something im sure a lot of people here have had ""I dont wanna be a fake smoker, so ill become a real stoner"" and that was all good and nice when i had a hard schedule to adhere to and parents forcing me to do things like go to school. 

Now that ive graduated from highschool and moved into college im starting to realize just how much its controling my life, I would smoke from the moment i wake up to the moment before i go to sleep if i could, staying ""high"" for as much of the day as i possible could and in turn i stopped hanging out with friends, i stopped going to my classes, and obviously i started failed them because of it.

It wasent untill about a week ago that I really sat down and thought about what is making me so depressed, and my though has always been ""Oh life is just depressing, and weed helps take the edge off it"" but i realized No, life is actually not terrible, but the only things im letting myself do are things that i literally had to.

Ive tried quitting a couple times before but never with so much thought behind it and i really do think this is the end for me and weed. It just turned from a fun drug to use at parties and when i wanna play video games to my entire lifestyle, and I can attests for the fact that using a drug as a lifestyle is not healthy lol (Obviously) I've been lucky in the fact that my friend group of 100% stoners is very supportive of my quitting, and they know im not doing it for any reason other than my own health.

Im sorry for the rant and i dont want any karma for posting this, I just want to say to anyone whos struggling to quit or on the fence about it (especially those closer to my age) You have the power to quit, but it isnt going to happen if you just have the thought and decide your going to do it without changing really anything elts. The nature of weed means its going to be a part of every activity you did while high, and i can tell you it isnt easy, but you have to take steps to change, and you especially need to tell people your quitting, Im not someone whos ever asked for emotional support from anyone, and i still wont ask for it, But just telling my friends that im doing it, telling my parents im doing it, and taking my shit and packing it away really holds me accountable for it. I was scared i would lose my friends by quitting but in reality ive done more real things with them in the last week than i have really in years, and im feeling great. Please if you tell your friends your quitting and they try and change your mind or threaten to leave just get outta there, if your friends are only friends with you while you do drugs then they arent people you need to be around and i promise you will find better ones just by showing that you have control over your life and are willing to better yourself.

The truth will set you free, but not until it is done with you.","Girlfriend of 4 1/2 years found out I was secretly getting high behind her back for the past two years. She’s the most supportive and honest person I’ve ever met. It was a horrible betrayal, to say the least. I lied so many times that I lost who I was, who she was to me, and what we could have had. At first, she forgave me, but I’ve compounded the damage since getting sober through my toxic emotional behaviors. I behave that way because instead of being honest, vulnerable and courageous, I chose to get high and only care about myself, so I never really made the sacrifices to change myself for the better. Now she’s burnt out. She gave her all; I didn’t. Trying to salvage what I can, but betraying someone who cares for you is a terrible sin. It’s one thing to hurt myself, and another to rob someone of their sense of trust and love. 

Not sure what else to say. The truth can not be destroyed by lies. The truth has come back with a vengeance equal to the abuse I dealt it with my repeated lies. I corrupted my soul and, worst of all, stole time from someone else’s life, someone who is more honest and courageous than I’ve ever been. I know that this is just the beginning of paying the price for my immoral choices. 

Time to man up and accept that everything unraveling is my fault. I knew what I was doing when I lied to the face of someone who loved me, whom I loved. 

Good luck to all of you and stay strong. Day 13.",40

Today is the first day I’m not going to smoke alone tonight. I feel it’s the only way to do it.

I'm finally quitting. I started smoking around 4-5 years ago, halfway through medical school. I managed to graduate, get into residency, complete my residency, and get a full time job- all while smoking nearly daily. I made sure to never go to work acutely intoxicated, given the high stakes nature of the job. That said, I remember days where I'd smoke several hours before a shift, knowing the majority of the effects would be gone by the time I would be seeing patients. My timings were always pretty accurate, and thankfully my habits did not lead to any significant, detrimental patient outcomes. They did manifest in other ways though. Maybe I stayed up late the night before, playing video games instead of studying or sleeping. Maybe I was so tired the next day that I'd find a few minutes during lunch to snooze in the call room. A few minutes late to work every once in a while wasn't a big deal. Waking up a couple hours late after sleeping through my alarm was probably my worst offense, sustained during my intern year, prompting a call from my chief resident to get my ass in there. Small things overall, or so I thought.

I would compensate for my waning short term memory with thorough and detailed patient notes, allowing me to get through rounds relatively unscathed. I passed my board exams on my first attempts, my patients had only good things to say about me, and my rotation reviews were always above average. My program director and coworkers had no idea the secret I was hiding. I knew the short term physiological effects that weed has on the body and always figured the pros outweighed the cons. It was an easy way to de-stress after a long day in the hospital and it made anything I was doing at home infinitely better.

I'm now a full fledged attending physician, with all the weight and responsibility that comes with the title. Despite being relatively high functioning, even with my addiction, I know I'm capable of much more. I know I can be better in almost every aspect of my life, from my personal relationships with my partner and my family, to my self-care, and to my work ethic/patient care. I even think my dog would benefit from my quitting. I've tried before but would always go back after a few weeks or months, especially if I was on a particularly stressful rotation.

I'm hoping this time is different, and I'm penning this post so that I have something in writing to look back on when I'm struggling. I hate the mental fog that lingers even after a day of smoking. I hate the subsequent anxiety and persistent feelings of inadequacy. I hate relying on a drug to help me cope with the difficulties of work and life in general. I felt like a loser, despite my outward success. I'm on day 4 and I already feel so much better. I'm getting things done around the house, working out regularly, and overall feeling optimistic for the future. I'm excited to see the improvement in mental clarity and memory over the coming days, weeks, and months. Most importantly, I'm excited to see my true potential.",49

I'm angry at myself.,"After I had scraped out every, and I mean every last fucking piece of whatever was left in my grinder, I was sure that I had nothing left to relapse on. If I was as thorough as I was clearing out my grinder with other aspects of my life, I probably wouldn't be on here writing this. But the depressing truth is that the addicition seems to be the only motivation that really works for me. Motivation not to be productive but destructive, though. I'm angry that it has come this far. 

I'm angry at the thought of myself, googling efficient ways to clear out a grinder, scraping it out and carefully collecting every speck of weed dust; then smoking that abomination of a joint, feeling dizzy because god knows what it all was I put in there; then feeling that all too familiar high, relieved that my efforts seem to have worked, followed immediately by regret, because what was I trying to accomplish by getting high one last time? I knew I wanted to quit. I knew I didn't want to buy any new weed. I hoped to get closure from that last joint, but it was just as all the other times I had smoked. Nothing different, except I knew I couldn't roll another one after the high started to fade. 

These last few days spent sober haven't been great. Not because of withdrawal but because of depression and lethargy. I didn't expect things to turn around after quitting because I know that smoking weed isn't the root of my problems. It's just one of the symptoms. But I recognized that I am much more vital in the mornings. I am able to form clear thoughts, which is nice.

Yesterday, out of nowhere, I had that taste in my mouth of a fresh hit of weed. Or rather, I remembered the taste vividly. And, surprisingly, it was rather unpleasant. I still haven't fully come to terms with the idea of never smoking weed again. To be perfectly honest, I can see myself relapsing in a social setting. But I am trying to mentally prepare to just say ""no thanks, I'm taking a break from smoking"" when offered any. This would be huge for me, to turn down a joint. I have failed to do that every time I intended to. But one time has to be the first time, right?

I will not be that loser in his late 30s with constant shadows around his eyes (no offense) who everyone will think has wasted his potential. I want to do something with my life. Quitting weed will not be enough but it's a start. I want this time to last...",18

I’ll go for months using it every day, mostly at night as a reward for myself for getting through the day (though definitely had some earlier periods where I hit it heavier, did some waking and baking briefly). I’ll go through daily use for several months, then realize it’s not a positive aspect of my life, and rather I’m using it as an escape, a means of procrastination, as an excuse for not accomplishing what I want to, and then I’ll quit for months on end. 

My last ‘sober’ stint, I was about 9 months clean and then I backslid around my birthday, and then got pretty into it again for several months. Now I’m 4 months totally clean.

I keep waiting for there to be a moment where I feel rejuvenated and detoxed and energetic and happy, a “pink cloud” phase that I guess alcoholics go through in their recovery. But I don’t feel that. Generally my mood is a bit more stable, I dream more often at night, and I don’t feel as foggy as I did when using daily. I definitely think I’m on the right path by not smoking weed at all.

The call to the herb is still there, and strong, at times. I try to be cognizant of what’s going on with my life when I feel like I’m being drawn back in. Its usually when I feel like I’m behind on things and I’m scared or lazy to do them. Journaling daily helps me with this, recognizing on a deeper level why I may want to smoke again. 

 I think weed has helped me in some ways, but also hurt me. I’m going to the gym a couple times a week, aiming to be more like 3-4. Are there other things I can do to feel better and further detoxed? Is there more I can expect the longer I stay sober?",3

It has drastically halted movement in my life, so please hear me out on what this once wonderful drug can do to your life.

You play out everyday exactly the same. You seek nothing new. You become complacent with what you have. Be it a lot or even a little. You don't seek that adventure life used to offer. That wonder of experiencing something new is replaced with a drive to get high.

I was thinking in the 10 years I've been getting high. I've made memories, though they are always tainted with getting high at the end of it... Leaving a family event to buy weed and smoke rather than be with your family. Missing out on A LOT life has to offer because you'd rather just get high rather than meeting people. Or even seeking a higher education and/or get a better job. And actually think about the future...

Marijuana used in an addictive manner will STOP your life in it's tracks. You'll notice your family and friends (if you still talk to them) start reaching milestones in their lives. While you're still trying to ""figure"" it out. But all you'd ever do if figure out a better way to get high for less money.

Siblings, cousins, friends will move on. They will have their families. And you will be by yourself and now marijuana has become a priority.  Funny thing about trying to quit is that saying you'll quit can be almost deceiving. You trick yourself into progress. As little as it is.  Once this happens life is put on ""fast forward"" and suddenly it's been 10 years.

Last spring I decided I was done smoking completely, disposed off all my remaining bud, all of my glass, and even my lighters. I was motivated. I felt better. I felt the urge to smoke all the time or smoke before everything faded. I was canoeing and people in my group offered me a hit from their joint. I said no. I plainly didn’t desire to do it at that time.

Fast forward to the summer. I got my wisdom teeth extracted, developed a major infection in a facial muscle space, and was out of work and laid up sick for weeks. I was prescribed medication for my initially surgery and more during the recovery. I took it all completely as prescribed and disposed of the extras when I no longer needed them. 

Life went on. I got better, went back to work, fell into the normal swing of things again. I started reflecting on my lack of smoking and decided I missed marijuana but I was glad to be done smoking. Suddenly I have this a ha moment and decide that I should get a dry herb vaporizer, like the ones I came across in college. I rationalized it would be far healthier but honestly deep down I also knew it would be a more enjoyable mode of consumption. 

I started vaporizing and quickly it became all day. Everyday. I hid it well. I maintained a professional identity. I was productive. But man was I high a lot. Dry herb vaporizing hits you very differently and I found I enjoyed it more than I maybe ever did smoking. All of that motivation I had last year to quit had vanished. Imagining going canoeing and not reaching out for the lit joint seemed impossible. It is such a bizarre dichotomy within me. 

Today I am writing this as I want to quit once again. I feel like an addict to this one drug in such a real manner — it’s like a love affair. But for personal reasons right now I want to stop. Full stop. Maybe I’ll waiver down the line again but today I want to stop. 

So here I go. My first goal is to abstain for the duration of Lent. My heart wants to say my motivation is to never blaze again but today I don’t think I can say that complete honesty. But I do want to stop. I will try. I will see what happens. If I backslide, oh well. I tried. 

Wish me luck.",1

Usually I feel really confident when posting on here, but this time it is I that needs some reassurance. I quit in the beginning of last december after long years of struggling with depression due to a really unhealthy relationship, constantly failing to achieve my goal of finishing my bachelor and also gaining a lot of weight after I lost almost 20 kilos a few years ago. I was angry with myself, I had to admit that I lost control over my addiction. 

The last months have been good so far. I feel that I am pretty stable on an emotional level again. My mind works as it is supposed to and I am getting more stuff done than before. I finally moved out of my old flat - my old roommates did a lot of drugs, the appartment looked like shit 24/7 and I had too many negative memories associated with that place.

I am quite happy with my new place and it is the first appartment that actually looks and feels like a real home to me. I also found a new roommate who I really get along with, she came to me by pure coincidence and we don't know each other, but I have a very good feeling about this.

It is the third month that I am sober and out of nowhere I started to think about getting high again. In the usual self-manipulative way. ""Only once is ok"", ""I have earned myself  a nice smoke after being absent for so long"", ""Saturday I go out drinking with my guys, might as well smoke a nice one on the way home with the lads""... stuff like that. 

My sleep is really shitty since a few weeks, I wake up feeling hungover with a headache, although I did not drink or anything the night before. It is really tough to get up, on top I don't have to work as much at the moment so I have a lot of days where I can sleep in. 

You guys have any ideas how to supress these thoughts and making the required next step? I want to start working out again, but it is tough to begin right now. I know I should get out of the house more so I don't chill at home so much... but maybe somebody has another good tip.

Thanks for reading, to all you guys struggling as well. Keep at it boys, it will be worth it in the end!",8

TW: suicidal thoughts 

I have been a marijuana user since the tender age of 13. Ten years later, and 4 years of non-stop THC cartridge vaping (got high when I woke up in the morning, got high in the bathroom at work, woke up in the middle of the night and got high, never was not high, even at church I was high) things started to come to a head in my life. I was supposed to get certain licenses for my work last year but had no discipline to study. I was coughing constantly and super sick but I was suicidal hoping I’d just die from vaping lung illness. 

On the surface I had everything together, a great job, wonderful family, I exercised daily, I had everything I wanted in life. But I was miserable. My significant other finally got through to me and wanted me to quit weed for my health - mental/emotional and physical. 

I had some time off work that I decided to take advantage of, to finally quit, and it was 24/7 agony for a month. I hadn’t been sober since my dad passed away in 2017 and a lot of emotional stuff I never dealt with came up. I was afraid I wouldn’t love my s/o anymore if I was sober. I had night terrors (when I could manage to sleep), sweats, nausea, I lost 15 pounds and couldn’t stand up without blacking out from low blood pressure. I was furious all the time, easily flew into a rage, and if I wasn’t angry then I was despondent and depressed. I was depressed before quitting too, so I guess that stayed the same. 

Things are better now. They aren’t perfect - I’m still high strung and easily aggravated, I still have nightmares every night and I still get hopelessly depressed. But I’ve been studying for my exams, I’m more organized and productive, been doing recreational things that are expensive and use up my money now instead of weed (snowboarding and biking, lol) and slowly trying to control my moods, temper, and anxiety, by merely being in the present moment. 

I’m sincerely sorry if my experience isn’t edifying to anyone, but please share feedback on when the nightmares go away, or how to feel normal again. Everyday I feel tempted to get high. There’s a voice in my head that says, “everything will get better, you will be so happy, all your problems will go away if you just get high.” The Devil sure is a liar. 

I made it this far, I don’t want to go through the withdrawal again, and that’s the only thing that kept me sober for this long.",3

2020-02-25 13:37:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f9etor/my_2_cents/,My 2 cents,"First of all thank you for the support of this amazing community. My account is an alt but in my other life I have seen/experienced numerous subs that are toxic and very unhelpful. For example when people have a shared interest to the degree that they all join the same sub there will obviously be redundancy with questions and advice. Very often I see people being very quick to say 'did you even search the sub or omg another newbie (insert topic) post' . That definitely isn't the case here, people are very helpful and supportive answering the same question multiple times in a day. The reason why this is so important is that  people, myself included, can obviously read other posts but when you're going through something like this you need support. We may have friends and family around us but it isn't the same as somebody who really understands what you're going through and can put your mind at ease.

I'm only at day 10 and I'm still going through a lot but with the help of people here I'm winning. I'm having a hard time with anxiety and I'm pretty sure it will pass but it's nice to be able to ask here (multiple times) and get a supportive answer. 

That brings me to another point on feelings. Through years of drug abuse we have numbed our feelings, shit that was the goal for a lot of us. When we quit those feelings are going to come flooding back at some point. Whilst it might feel scary at first it's just the first steps of really living your life. For me it's a trade off that's worth it, there are so many success stories here. Never wanting to feel like this again is a major driving force for me, I think this time it will stick. 

We're all doing something positive and it's going to be hard for a while, just don't beat yourself up too much. All positive change takes time so just focus on not getting stoned for now, there's plenty of time after that for all the good stuff to come. When the days are hard or you're tempted to relapse come here and rant or ask for a helping hand, it will make things a little easier and there are so many nice people that you can lean on. 

Just my 2 cent and a big thank you to everyone who has helped me so far.",7

But today, I woke up to my alarm for class, and told myself I needed to go. I had a few thoughts of giving myself excuses and going back to bed, but ultimately, I had the motivation to get out of bed and go work to attain my goals. I haven't won that battle in at least 18 months.

Idk if this is a struggle for anyone else, but for me it is. My brain just seems to block out the thoughts of quitting until I actually get the bud. I hope this makes sense, because in my mind it does. Or maybe over thinking?

With each passing day I feel progress in my recovery. But a with few years of off and on relapses under my belt, I can say that the better I feel the less I remember why I made this decision. 

You would think that feeling healthy, energetic and productive after years of not would make me want to stay that way forever. The reality is in my brain, I'm tricked into no longer remembering/associating the hellhole I dug myself into with weed, as I'm physically and mentally feeling better. I start to remember some of the great moments I had while high. I start having intrusive thoughts that start simple:

""Let's be real, ***will I really never smoke again in my entire life***? That's probably not realistic""

Not long after, this turns into something far, far more sinister.

""Well my buddy is coming over this weekend, I could have ***one toke*** then""

That thought. Suddenly, I find myself ***planning*** when I will use. I've now had some great counseling and resources that have helped me identify this is my first step towards a relapse. In the moment, I don't seem to remember what it was like constantly thinking about when I'll get high next. Constantly thinking about how much I have left. For everyone that has experienced it, this is a nightmare.

**Don't forget** how you felt when you made the decision to quit. **Don't forget** the first few weeks of garbage you put yourself through to start your recovery. **Don't forget** the people you had pushed away because you were focused on getting high.

But also don't forget your human. Every time I have relapsed, it has reinforced that giving this up was the right decision. Without quitting (no matter how long) , you would never have the baseline of how great life can be without weed. I would never be in the place I am today without my first 6 week streak, no matter how short that seems. 

If it helps keep a diary of how you felt to remind yourself. Make posts here on Leaves. Tell others about how you feel in those dark moments. All these things help to keep the memory alive that you did this for a reason, and no matter how great you feel today that reason ***still applies***.

I have smoked for a while, since I was a freshman in highschool and then I just picked up the habit. I live in a small town, like really small. No cops except maybe every once in a while, nothing besides a post office and a bar in the town. I fell into a bad crowd, ended up hanging out with guys in their late 20s while I was still a sophomore and we always got fucked up. Smoked everyday when I was a sophomore (almost always, may have had some off days but not very many). I continued this habit for a long time until last year. I sobered up mid February and then Easter came around. Got picked up by my step brother and, it was 4/20, and like a snap of a finger my sobriety was gone. Quit the very next day to get a better job, stayed sober for 3 months and I left my job I was at for 2 years (was a dead end, never got promoted, never got a raise. When I left everyone told me it was a dead end job and the boss would never let me leave my position because of how good I was at my job.) Worked from July too November, and then I got layed off and that's where I started again. Bad friends (I don't have many friends at all, and my bad ones are still good friends, but they try to keep me high with them 24/7) hmu and before I knew it I was in my same habits, just different ways. By this time I got a new appartment, and my roomates aren't ok with pot in their house, but I just got dabs and a dab pen and chiefed in the hours of the night nobody would notice. My roomate told me my room smelled like dab, and I lied, told her some girl got some dank shit on my shirt and that it reeked. 

I've been house sitting for my gma and kept dabbing. Shit went to hell, she broke her sobriety as well (she's hurting bad, has scripts for oxys, used to be an alcoholic, and I guess she is now) and she told me I didn't love her. I do love her, I have never never never done anything to ever make her think otherwise. This woman holds a spot in my heart. But bad drugs and alcohol change you, she told me she didn't love me and that I was a disgrace (in my family there are alot worse disgraces then me, I'm just bad because I tried stopping her from buying booze, and she got pissed). This hurt bad. That day I was crying, losing my mind, had my dab pen in the room, GOD every single cell in my body wanted me to hit it, just one and no one would ever know, but I would know. Addiction runs in my genes fairly badly, 3/4 of my grandparents have been alcoholics, both my parents were alcoholics, my dad got his shit together, my mom not so much. These thoughts flashed through my head, yea weed ain't as bad as alcohol, or scripts imo, but I was still pushing my emotions to the wrong places, suppressing them with the wrong things. 

I decided not to hit that dab pen that day, and have stayed sober from weed since then however it's not that long. That night I left my grandma's house, and a family friend picked me up and took me to a bar. Alcohol isn't a better crutch, but Jesus my grandma who I have loved tremendously just ripped a big ole chunk out of my already fucked up heart. I got drunk. I know that I don't want to rely on crutches too keep my emotions feeling in check. So I'm staying off the weed for now, I'm going to get my shit together, and then I'm going to keep getting my shit together. Going to moderate the alcohol better too, although I don't drink all the time, I need to learn to deal with my emotions better. As soon as I get home I'm buying weights, and everytime I feel stressed to shit, I'm gonna work my arms out.

I know sobriety is hard, I'm not one too say it's extremely hard, I know people have it alot worse than me, but I'm posting here to say that I'm going to stay clean, and chances are if I struggle I'm going to post here. I hope you all have good luck, I know I'm going too need it too!",4

I'm so close to being able to cut out the drinking and commit to a real workout routine, and now my brain is telling me I want to start smoking again?!  You've got to be kidding me!

This is the longest I have been off of pot in 4 years and I must say it feels good. It’s been really tough, last weekend at my buddy’s birthday party it would have been real easy to cave, or at work with my coworkers, or everyday on the way home when I pass my old dispensary. But I haven’t! Whenever I’ve been feeling tempted I just try and remember why and who I’m doing this for. In these two weeks alone I have been feeling more social and have been performing better at work. In reality I’m probably just trying to distract myself with other things because I still think about weed quite often.But right now I’m on my longest sober streak yet and I’m not giving that up for something I know I’ll regret!

To anyone reading these posts on this sub, considering it for yourself, I encourage you to try it yourself. Even if your break isn’t permanent, the effects of habitual daily smoking can be devastating and sometime off to reevaluate your relationship with the drug could be useful. I’ve realized I was probably more addicted than I thought. simply by just how much I think about it even when I’m not doing it. I think about when I’m going to end this streak and when I’ll be satisfied with taking another hit. The truth is I’m not sure that day will ever come. I’m afraid I’ll lose the battle with my brain and fall right back into the same boat I was in two weeks ago.

Haven’t been active lately here but wanted to come through and give you guys an update that I’ve made it to 4 months! I’ve very happy to have made it this far and plan on never going back as weed has heavily damaged some stuff in my life, especially mentally, but I’m still trying to pull through. 

PAWS is absolutely the biggest thing I’m dealing with now 4 months in. Having anxiety and major depressive disorder for 10 years has definitely had its different stages but I can definitely feel the PAWS hitting me hard now. It’s making me not be happy where I am in life, mainly financially and status wise for my age. I wish I’m making more money, eating healthier, I wish I hadn’t wasted these past almost 3 years smoking weed everyday to escape my problems, I’m pissed I wasted those years. It’s even to a point where even though I’ve been working a job for so many years, I’m dreading the constant monotonous weekly cycle of just work now. Then again weed helped me get through that so there’s that answer I suppose. I’m just overall super depressed where I am in life, I just feel broken. I plan on going back to therapy soon once my new health insurance change goes through. I really need help mentally and I’m struggling to hang on and get through most days, all I’m doing is clinging on to the little things that still make me happy to get by, that’s all that’s working.

I guess I’m just curious how PAWS has affected you guys this late in being sober and how you managed to get through it or what things helped?",7
2020-02-25 09:13:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f9au4y/its_time_to_quit/,It's time to quit.,"I've been smoking at least once a week for just over one year now.  It's time for it to end.  Yesterday I could hear people smelling it when I was on transit and I was more embarrassed than I ever have been.  I could hear them asking each other ""is that weed?  It smells like weed in here."".  Thinking to myself that it was my fault that they were smelling it and being uncomfortable disgusts me.  I hate knowing how society views someone like me, even though it's legal.
I used to use weed as a way to enhance games that I was playing.  It would make me a lot more excited about what was going on.  Sometimes I would remember things I had forgotten a long time ago, and I would feel good.  That still will happen, but lately I would smoke a joint before travelling to my girlfriend's place, I would smoke before some classes that I said were ""too boring to experience any other way"", and I would smoke after classes like crazy.  I can't do that anymore.
I've seen a few posts here that hijacking my rewards centre in my brain by smoking is fucked up, that it should be more natural to feel pleasure like any other human being.  A substance isn't the key to that, rather experiences should be.
There's no way this is going to be easy.  I'm following another post on this sub that discusses having an Addiction Avatar and an unbreakable rule.  Yesterday I planned to be sober the rest of the week and have one final smoke on saturday, but now I'm thinking I should probably just go cold turkey.

It seems like I can’t convince myself that weed is actually harmful, that it’s actually negatively impacting me. I apologize for the long post, I really feel the need to just dump this out and I haven’t found a place where I thought it would fit until now. Will include TL;DR at the end. 

Background: 
I started smoking in 2016, and it slowly ramped up by smoking more and more with the friend who introduced me until I got my own supply in summer 2017. Shortly after that I became an every day smoker, buying weed weekly. Suddenly I looked back and two years had passed with me rarely going a day without smoking. I had become a stoner, and I was okay with it. But then in August-September of 2019 I started experiencing unexplained and unbearable abdominal pain that would occur seemingly randomly in the middle of the night. At first it was occasional and I thought it was odd instances of gas pains, but it started getting more frequent so I started to look at my life and habits/lifestyle to see if I could identify the cause.  It led me to finally ask that question I’d been too afraid to ask for the last year. Did I have an addiction? A quick google search about side affects of weed use gave me an article about signs of weed addiction and I had every. Single. One. (The abdominal pain turned out to be a gall stone, completely unrelated). I felt an epiphany and called my boyfriend to tell him. He told me he had noticed the amount I used was problematic and that he felt at some point as we got more serious it would have become a problem for our relationship. He said he fully supported me in trying to quit. Which I did. The next day I flushed my supply. I made it almost a month without smoking again, until I found an excuse. After that I told myself I would just do it once a week, and not keep it in the house so I wouldn’t be tempted. But my boyfriend and I were long distance and only seeing each other on weekends, and he was the only one I was truly honest with about it, so I had no babysitter five days a week. So using once a week turned into three-five days a week. I still was maintaining good periods of sobriety through the end of 2019 but post-Christmas I managed to start using almost everyday again. Since then it’s been pretty much a spiral. I’ve been doing enough regular stuff (besides getting high) to keep my life going, but just barely. And my previous convictions about getting weed out of my life are pretty weak. On the one hand I feel like a life of daily smoking weed is not part of me making the life I want happen for myself, on the other it is my absolute favourite way to enjoy time off and I feel like I should be able to have it when it’s a special occasion, a day off, etc.  I just really want to have a healthy relationship with this substance. Even worse, my boyfriend now pretty much lives with me, and through smoking with me often he has started to get re-attached to it as well (he was a regular smoker as a teenager but hasn’t for years). He is by no means dependent like me, but he craves it for stress relief now too.  Now I feel like if I give it up I’m also taking something away from him. 
I basically just really need some help from people who have been through this in changing my perceptions of weed, in knowing my life will be just as good without it. 

TL;DR: realized I was addicted in October, quit cold turkey for less than a month, then went back. Now am using more than is healthy again, but can’t find the motivation to quit again for anything more than a couple days. Advice is welcome.",2

I'm on day 5 again, past tries were chaotic, mostly because my work has been a weight on my nerves, and because i'm insecure about everything. 

But this time, i know it will be ok. Day 5, i don't work for another week, so i'm starting to creating new habits to be more reassured, i have no choice this time, no more stash, and my dealer has quit the life. Surprinsingly, i feel good about it.  
Here's what worked for me, in case you need some inspiration !   


\- I've put together a list of what i'll be able to get back by quitting weed, things like not panicking when i want to drive somewhere, because i could lose my license for smoking like 3/4 days ago, i denied myself a lot of things, it's been like two years since i've put a feet in a forest for example; being able to eat healthy and stop feeling bad for being ""fat"", weed made me lost 15kg, and if i lose more i might put my health in jeopardy; getting rid of my hair's dryness, being able to socialize, even though i'm an introvert, weed put that on another level, i wasn't able to relate to my own family. Actually be able to consider relationship, without having to hide my weed problem to everyone i meet, fearing judgement, losing my job, or else. Rediscovering my creativity instead of just playing Tool songs again and again.  
Try and see what YOU want to get back, what really matters for you.   


\- I've put a mirror aside to my computer screen, as a reminder of self, it works pretty well.  


\- Print photos, hang things around your place to remind you of all that you've been loving through life  


\- Get a bunch of paper, note what you'd like to accomplish, and what you actually did every day. I use a bullet journal but anything work really, as long as you can see that you are doing way more things when you're sober. Don't feel bad about not doing what you expected, instead be grateful for what you did. Being in the moment will make you so much powerful, you can do what you actually need instead of waiting for things to happen.  


\- Important lesson i got from parks and rec: Treat yo'self. Buy yourself nice things, eat things you like, spend your weekend watching movies if you'd like, especially at the start. I've haven't be doing this on the previous times i tried quitting, and it's been absolutely horrible. 

&#x200B;

\- Be aware of your triggers, avoid them for some time, for me it's mainly when i sit down to watch a tv show, like trailer park boys, i'll be back at it in a few weeks, but for now, it's time to try other things. Give it some time, and you'll again be able to do what you where doing while high.

&#x200B;

Finally, i'd like to say : Don't feel bad for what happened, i mean, weed is a fabulous helper when you need it. I know that i might be back to smoking at some points in my life if i find the need to, because it is so much better that alcohol or xanax, but like every other substance, it loses it's point if you abuse it. I hope that i can find what i need in life so i will never need to do that, and i hope you do to.

I’ve always been a functional user so I guess that’s why I allowed it to go on for so long before I finally realized I wasn’t happy because of my own choices and not because of my circumstances or personal situation in life. I quit drinking at the end of November last year. I’m on Day 4 of being sober from weed. Still trying to get past the physical symptoms, now that they are subsiding, I seem to be emotionally hypersensitive to everything and I find myself feeling so anxious or frustrated to the point of tears but there’s no specific reason why. Fortunately, I have amazing support from family and friends. Last night, when my bf came home from work he saw that I was clearly in a bad head space, and I keep him in the loop with all the details of this healing journey ( even the constipation, insomnia, coughing up a ton of phlegm with gross dark brown specs, etc). He helped calm me down with a massage and an episode of bad tv (The Bachelor) and just generally giving positive feedback and energy, and it helped me so much. But through those moments, I caught myself observing my physical body relax with time, my mind soon followed after. I learned that when I find myself feeling overwhelmed or like I need something to calm me down like a glass of wine or a bong rip, I just need to slow my mind down somehow. I have to force myself to relax. Much of this recovery process is mental fortitude and determination. Self care is essential, so finding new healthy ways to calm myself during times of stress or frustration or just feeling down is going to be what I focus on the next several weeks. I’ve picked up my yoga practice again and although it’s been difficult to continue going to class while detoxing, I’m trying. I’m trying to teach my body what I need from it to be WELL, not simply what is needed to get by. Thanks for reading. These forums have been helping me stay sober so I thought I’d share.

I’m more focused at work, more motivated to get out of my comfort zone, more socially motivated etc.,but... I still feel high 24/7. I am constantly in a fog that makes me feel like I’m on autopilot. It’s one of the worst feelings that I’ve experienced about quitting.

I have posted here before asking about it and have gotten no real answers, and I’m starting to worry that I’m stuck like this for the rest of my life. I’m very disappointed that I may have damaged myself for life, but oh well that was my decision. Never going back, so here’s to better days ahead I guess",7

So I’ve been a lurker/ on and off leaves for about 6 months now and although I started smoking a couple of years ago (ever), I believe the journey needs to end. I’ve made so many positive changes in my life in past 2 months (being on NoFap journey and exercising) I think it’s time to say goodbye to weed as well.

Honestly, being on this substance for only about 2.5 years, I don’t see any side effects other than being a bit lazy (which is my primary motivation for quitting). So, generally my motivation is not too high but I know I can do this as I got over my other addictions like junk food and fapping.

Please kindly let me know if you’ve some good materials on benefits of leaving this habit (I’ve already read your amazing stories, but just in case you’ve got some other exciting stories saved in your profile) and send it my way.

Any and all motivation and help is appreciated!

I've made it through the first day and the urges are not too bad so far.",4

I had a great weekend.  I felt the best I had in years.  It was so great it was almost like I was living in an aura.  I thought that I was really getting over it.  Then today happened.

It started with the return of night sweats last night and waking up drenched.  Then it was one of the most stressful, busiest days ever at my job.  I work in a call center and deal with call after call of angry customers all day long.  One customer was especially bad and I just lost it and had a panic attack.  It was bad.  Today is a day that I'm not going to soon forget.  ANd also, now it's back to blurred vision and halos around lights.

It's so tempting to just go back to smoking because I can't keep this up.  This is pure torture.  I hate where I am currently at in life and the fact that there's no quick fix.  At least weed made me content.",3

I started up and began taxiing around, chopping up zombies with the propeller and knocking them down with the wings.  I noted that I was wearing flip flops while operating the plane which is unsafe since the flop could get stuck in the pedal, but not to worry.  Just before there were too many zombies piling on top of my plane I gained enough speed, the tail raised up and we took off.

After quitting weed for a few months now , I experienced something else that needs to be brought to others attention. 

Loneliness.

Like many of you , my social circle was built around people who smoke weed every day , it’s just the way it is . You want to get high and you want a nice group of people to get high with and do fun shit . That’s all good and well, but guess what happens after you quit weed ? 

Those people might call for a week or two , but after they know you don’t smoke anymore , their calls dwindle smaller and smaller before becoming non-existent . 

Prepare to feel lonelier than usual , and embrace this as a period of healing . Take up a class , eat healthy , make new friends , basically use this time to build up a new social circle that supports your new sober self . 

If you fail to do this ,  loneliness may get the better of you and you may find yourself back to your old group of friends doing the same old shit.

Good luck to the new people putting down the weed and to the people already deep into their weed recovery , you guys are superstars and stronger than you give yourself credit for :)",44

I smoked morning noon and night for ten years, probably more. I was dreading terrible withdrawal symptoms but have only really had the crazy dreams, and just a little insomnia. I consider myself very lucky. I was so so worried about anxiety and irritability and feeling unmotivated. None of that.. I’ve always had anxiety, but now that I don’t smoke, I’ve actually had less. I have, however, had a cold for a solid 2.5 weeks including sinusitis and bronchitis! It certainly has helped me stay quit. It’s just weird because I’ve always had such a strong immune system. I rarely ever get colds. Can’t even remember the last time I had one before this. Is it possible that it has to do with quitting weed? Anyone else experience this? I know it may not make much sense but I’m just curious to ask. My partner and I are also TTC.. I’m hopeful that the reason we have been having difficulty is because I’ve been a heavy user, and not anything else. Anyone have stories about achieving pregnancy after saying goodbye to Mary Jane?

LET'S GOO!!!,"I just went through my bank statements and I spent roughly $500 on weed in February alone. That's money that could be sitting in my pocket right now but got pissed away due to my addiction. I made it about two solid weeks sober in January and felt great but got tempted when my roommates were smoking and caved. Of course, once I light up that part of my brain again, it can be hard to stop and February has been mostly a haze. I have still been high functioning and performing at work but it has definitely grown into a problem.

 I always justify my habit by saying it makes me more creative or inspired but it's all bullshit, really I'm just looking for a cheap dopamine fix. The thing is, my cannabis habit is directly correlated to all of my other shitty habits. When I smoke, I eat like dog-shit, masturbate, and play video games. When I'm not smoking, it is easier for me to keep my diet in check, control sexual desire, and keep my exercise regime more consistent. 

So all in all, it seems like a no-brainer to simply quit the herb for good. We've had some good times, and cannabis was a part of my life for about 10 years now but ultimately it is time to move on. I just threw away my oil pen and even this cool pipe that I got at the Renaissance Faire. I know there will be a lot of temptation but I will be strong and weather the storm. It might take two years for brain changes to occur but I think if I'm persistent I can really beat this. 

What scares me though is the thought of me not beating this. Of looking forward ten years into the future and having nothing to show for it but a hazy cloud. This haunts me deeply as it should all of us who struggle with this addiction. However, we shouldn't shy away from this picture, instead we should stare it in the face, focus our concentration and make this image of ourselves crystal clear in our minds so that we know what the real consequences are. In the same way, we can project forward to our lives in 2030, having ten years of sobriety under our belt, and try and see what that looks like. This simple thought exercise can help you understand where you do and don't want to go and who you do and don't want to be which can give you a better map for action. In ten years I could be a drug addicted, overweight, broke, screen-zombie loser or I could be the best version of myself.

Throwaway b/c reasons.

So I have an extremely checkered past with marijuana. For the past 10 years I've fluctuated between extremes, I've been a daily smoker at times, I've also avoided literally any contact with it for years. Today I am 2 weeks free despite being on vacation during that time in a country where hashish is literally everywhere and easy to access for tourists. Small, but a wins a win eh? Today was also the best workout i've had in YEARS so I wanted to post about it here!

I'm one of those stero-typical stoners, I've used every excuse in the book - it's not addictive just habit forming, It's a special occasion, just for tonight, i'm on holiday, I've got work/school under control so why not? What i didn't know when i started smoking in high school was that I was subconsciously self treating an un-diagnosed anxiety disorder. Many years and therapy sessions later, I'm still struggling with that part of my life but I'm committed now to working through my issues instead of numbing them away. 

So back to the workout. I'm not the worlds fittest, but I'm also not out of shape by any means, I'm firmly in the middle of the pack. I've always exercised off and on throughout my life - be it sports, running, or weight lifting. But I've never really excelled in the gym, mostly just kept pace with the  (unhealthy) diet I kept. Today was totally different, I was throwing up great lifts, with strong form, and setting personal records on a number of combined lifts. IT FELT SO GOOD! 

I have this memory from when i was an early teenager, maybe 13-14 y/o of going to the gym and seeing this older guy in great shape doing shoulder presses. For whatever reason it stuck with me and I've often thought about how I want to one day be the older guy to my proverbial teenager. I want someone, somewhere to look at me and be like DAMN I want that. I'm certainly not there but I'm way closer in the last year than I have been ever before. 

All of this is to say - the life journey is rarely if ever linear. Sometimes we quit doing something harmful only to come back and do it again. Sometimes we need to learn and re-learn lessons. Its ok. Its a struggle but there can be progress hidden in there somewhere. Be kind to yourself on this weird path. Thanks for reading

I guess I didn't realize how much I'd been using weed as a way to deal with (or not deal with) my anger, and  now that I've cut it out, literally anything and everything makes me fly off the handle (overwhelming urges to break things,  hit things, yell at people, etc etc.). I was always pretty angry as a kid, and consequently ended up in a few different anger management classes, but it was never this bad, and I thought I'd moved past it for the most part. None of the ways I learned to control my anger are working, and at times it feels like they're making it worse. I've been trying to incorporate meditation and yoga into my daily routine, but again, not much help, and they really just make me angrier.

I've tried explaining the essential stuff in the context part, but I tried going into more details on some in the backstory, such as my childhood and alcoholism that I won't mention otherwise (But can help understanding my situation.)


**Context:** I'll be 28 in a month, I've smoked weed since age 8 or 9, and daily (more like hourly tbh) since the last 10 years. I've developed insomnia at the end of my childhood and start of adolescence, I would say on average it would take me 1-2 hours to fell asleep (and would often skips nights (maybe once every 2 or 3 weeks) or do short sleep like 4-5 hours almost every night.


During a long time, I wasn't aware that weed was helping me to sleep, or in the long run if it contributed to my insomnia, I'm still not sure. But It was definitely helping putting myself to sleep without my realizing it (on the short term, daily basis).


Over the years, I've developed a quite strong social anxiety thing too.. Where I'm literally not able to go to public, (like seeing friends) if I'm not under the influence, it makes me super anxious to the point where I almost get paranoia and all I think about is ways to find justifications to just leave. I have trouble going out just doing grocery if I'm not under the influence. The only place I wasn't really thinking about it is at work (I'm a web developer). This has gotten to a point where even when I'm alone at home, I cannot do anything constructive like house work, cleaning or even stuff like entertainment unless I roll a fat one after work, then all my worries goes away, and I enjoy the moment, and then have no problem doing any sort of stuff in general, such as house work, cleaning or entertainment for example. 


Also over the years, I've noticed that my memory goes away over time. Like I can see a definitive difference in my ability to remember simple stuff every year compared to the last one. Also I've noticed that I've acquired some sort of brain fog (I really dunno how to best describe it, but I'll give it a shot) Like when reading stuff that need critical thinking and understanding, I need to read super slowly and re-read the sentence like 4-5 times to put the words together and let my brain interpret what I'm reading before starting thinking more deeply about it. (The part of understanding the text, not the creative taught process part after it). Or just learning in general, like I can learn a super complex guitar riff in about 2 hours that I would've learnt in 15minutes 10 years ago, even tho my technique is way better, the part of learning the riff is soo difficult, then went I reaally know it (like second nature level of knowledge where you dont need to think about it.) Then, and only then I can scale up the speed and since I have the technique now, I can scale it up quite fast, while before I would learn fast but need to practice a lot, to scale it up. Like right now I would learn 1 part just about perfectly, then play it at 50% speed 2 times, and then the 3rd time i just have a blank and don't remember anything.. it's like trying to see the road in a super dense fog while driving, but imagine that in your brain while trying to think of what you just learnt.


Now I'll try to describe my insomnia a bit, When i go to sleep, i think a lot.. Like it can be any little detail like having a quick though about whatever nonsense, and my brain will pick that information will start analyzing it like If I needed to develop an app on that nonsense, and more often than not, I'm not even aware of it. Most of the time I will snap out of it and realize how deep I was into those though, and say to myself.. Fuck mate, now think NOTHING! then no more than a second later it's something else and that start again. On top of that, I'm someone who is passionate about technical death metal music, and I've listen to so much stuff that I feel like there's not a single moment in my daily life that I don't hear a song playing in my head (especially if it's silence around me), like for example, right now I've been trying to learn Spawn of Possession - Apparition recently, and since I started that, this song is literally playing in my subconscious all the time, (which I kinda like in a way, but when I'm trying to sleep... It's quite disturbing, and compared to the train of though I talked about, which i can at least stop thinking for a second, those noise won't stop ever, unless I listen to a video or music or something enough to distract me enough to not hear it at all, but as soon as it stop, I hear it again (like if it never stopped but i was just ignoring it). Also even If I don't listen to any music at all for long periods (months), I still hear death metal in my brain all the time, and it's so fucking precise it's weird.. It's just like I was listening the real thing (Probably the fact that I'm a musician myself help my brain memorize them so clearly)


So now my relationship with weed is quite intense and unhealthy. I feel like I need it to be functional in life, and I smoke so much, that I don't even feel a difference in my learning/concentration if I'm on the influence or not. The brain fog is always there. I don't even feel the high like I remember the old days, I just have a motivation kick (especially with sativa dominant), it makes me more social, and it help myself to diminish these abundant though when I try to sleep (With Indica dominant stuff)


Then on August 25th 2019, I've had a motorcycle crash that nearly took my life. (Don't worry I was not under the influence lol, even tho I for sure wouldn't have crashed If i was, because I wouldn't have put myself in that situation, but not gonna explain what happened here..). I fractured my left femur really bad and spent 11 days in the intensive care at the hospital, the operation took about 6 hours because the fracture was bad and there was femur fragments that nearly punctured the main vein that goes to the hearth (not sure how to call that in English) and loss a lot of blood in the process. So as you know, in hospital, you can't get weed xD. This was a real struggle on top of what I was going through, and was determined take the opportunity to stop as hospital time would've helped me cope with a bit of the withdrawal. 


During my intensive care stay, (11 days), there wasn't a night that I got more than 1 hour of sleep. In total, I'd say I probably felt asleep for about 8-10 hours, and when your body/mind goes through such a trauma situation, you really need sleep for your body to do it's things and ""repair itself"". Of course I was super open with the doctors and stuff since I'm a super open minded individual in general, and really wanted to figure out a way to find a solution. They tried a whole bunch of benzodiazepine and other drugs on top of opiath for the pain, just to let me deal with both weed widtdrawal and sleep issues (this familly of drug is used for those 2 things and anxiety i think) but none worked, not even a tiny bit.. other than give me secondary effects (which in one case was pretty brutal). And the last 2 days, at the hospital, I was so sleep deprived, that I started to loose movement coordination, had trouble speeking clearly, couldn't focus at all, and had severe memory loss (like at 8am, i wouldn't remember if i had gone to poop or if the breakfast had come or not).


When I got back at home on day 11, I couldn't take it anymore and smoked before bed to finally get some sleep (which worked very nicely along with melatonin). This went on for 3 days and then couldn't take it anymore again, and started smoking basicly the whole day again, (this helped me mentally a lot to recover tho, because I don't think i'd had the mental strength without weed during my recovery). Also I had no medication anymore for pain because the opiath they gave me was worse than not taking them, they prescribed me dilaudid and it was causing more pain from the discomfort of the side effects than not taking it, so i was only taking Acetaminophen).

I even loss vision a day on my first morning I wake up at home (because of the shock my body went through just sleeping for the first time since I had crashed 12 days prior. Like I'm short-sighted, but this morning when I woke up, I couldn't read text on my phone even at like 10 cm from my face, with or without my glasses. Ended up suffering the whole day at the emergency at the hospital in a state where i couldn't walk or barely could sit for more than 10minutes because of my injuries from the accident, and in the end it was good, cuz it was nothing bad (just my eyes couldn't focus by themselves due to the shock of finally having slept a bit, so it took about a day to become normal again)


Also for a while, I had to take melatonin on top of weed for a while because on top of my insomnia, the pain was definitely another obstacle to sleep and weed wasn't enough, and for some reason melatonin definitely helped a bit.


Now fast forward 6 months, and here we are, my writing this post. I've now started to work again today, I'll be progressively going full time again over a period of 1 month, and I really want to take this period to tackle my addiction.



*------------------- SKIP If this part if it's too long -------------------->*


**BACKSTORY:** So, I'm a male age 27 (28 in a month), I've started smoking weed around the age of 8 or 9, I also started drinking alcohol around that time as well. I cannot remember clearly, but had a really hard time as a child with stuff that I'm not comfortable to talk with anybody so I won't mention it more than that, but it definitely was a trigger, to starting so young (as well as the environment I was in, let's say it made it easy).


Then at around age 14-15 I started drinking regularly basically every evening i would get a older friend to get me some Jack-Daniels or a 6-pack / 12 pack of beer out of the grocery store. Then I started college after highschool and I started smoking weed basically every time I wasn't doing school related work. During this first month of college, I acknowledged that I was becoming an alcoholic by the fact that I burnt almost all my money I had on the side to buy beers (drank basically a 24 pack a day on average and slowed down to probably 12 beers a day after the first month). This wasn't really a big problem for me at the time (other than financially) because I was still having no problems with school grades and stuff, and was happy about myself anyway, so I started to sell weed to pay for my beer and weed. 


When I started to work after college, it was nice cuz I could finally stop selling weed and earn my shit legally. (I've tried working legally during college, but as my parent are super poor, I had financial aid from government (almost all in loans, initially i had 1.5k in scholarship, and maybe 6k a year in loans)), but when I worked in a grocery during college for maybe 2/3 a year, lets say I was paid 9 bucks an hour but by declaring this work, they cut over 50% of that from my scholarship, so if i gained like 4k by working in the financial year, they would've cut all the scholarship, and 1k in loans, so i still had to pay back the full loans anyway, and it was like i earned 1/4 of what I earned. The worst thing was that wasn't synced (I worked lets say in 2011, but the cuts were for 2012). So I stopped working legally and started doing work that's not declared such as helping local farmers with their land, on top of selling weed.



My alcoholism went on for about 3 years on the same pace, I then started drinking microbrewery IPA's cuz I discovered that I loved the taste of the IPA so much, and after a while, it made me slow down quite a bit because I started having stomach issues because I was only drinking double and triple IPA basically every day (3-4 beers on weekday after work, and at least a 6 pack on week-end). Then I one day after maybe 2 or 3 years of double IPA every day, I decided to stop alcohol altogether , and just like that in a snap of fingers, I literally stopped and had no trouble with it (sure withdrawal and stuff, but dealt with it pretty easily.)


I've also tried to stop smoking weed twice during this 4-5 year period, but it didn't worked. One of the main limitations for me is sleeping. I've had pretty bad insomnia every since I was 7-8 years old. During adolescence I've also did some quite dumb stuff when it comes to sleep because around age 12 to 14, I was basically skipping sleep to do some computer related activity (of course my parents didn't know). I would sleep often like 4-5 hours only and sometime i wouldn't sleep at all if I felt I could handle it. This was very dumb in retrospect, because that's basically the part of your life that you really need to get that sleep for your brain development and stuff.


The first time I've tried stopping weed was in 2nd year of college, because at the time, my girlfriend was putting pressure on me to stop it. (For good reasons, but at the time, I wasn't even considering myself addicted, even if i definitely was.) This first time I tried, I stopped for about  4 or 5 days but couldn't take it longer and started smoking again. During this 4-5 days I was spending around 10 hours per night in bed trying to sleep at perfectly normal times and all, but over these 4-5 days, I don't think i managed to get more than 2-3 hours of sleep (total).


A year later the same thing happened, tried for a couple of days, it but exactly the same outcome and only lasted for about 3-4 days.


I find it funny that most people say that weed is not addicting (which I though for long that I wasn't) and that alcohol is hard to quit. For me it's the exact opposite, I feel like alcohol was more of a physical withdrawal while weed is more mental and I somehow can't deal with that part of me, at least I didn't figured out how yet.


*------------------------------------------*


Now my plan to try to tackle it right now, to set myself a threshold like for example ""I cannot use weed before 5PM"" and to increase it progressively until I manage to only smoke before bed to make me sleep. I aim to reach the only before sleep in about a month when I'm back to full time working. Then stage 2 will be to find a way to be able to sleep safely.


My first fear is being not able to respect the threshold due to being miserable without it. So I might need a plan B to add on top of my first stage right now (which I have no idea what to try if it happen)


What I am seeking here for advice is mainly about two things.

1) What can I do to help myself cope with the withdrawal (Can be anything, but I don't want to replace it with another vice. If I need something to replace with, which I will try not to at least, I don't want another money sink or anything that can be bad in a way.) Like just before this post I've been 2 hours doing literally nothing at home just being super anxious and thinking about smoking a fat one, but trying as hard as I can to resist, and I cannot motivate myself to do anything really right now.)

2) Anything that I can try that can improve my sleeping, This is literally my biggest fear. It's so bad that I fear If in my current state right now,If they pick me and sent me in a context where it's literally impossible to have weed, like being in another country or having another experience such as the motorcycle accident i had, but for a longer period, I fear that I would get brain damage / organ failure from sleep deprivation over a few weeks to a month.


Also I fear that the withdrawal won't go away if I continue to smoke before bed to at least sleep. Which will make it much harder to deal with during the day. So I feel like it's important to deal with both of these issues seriously.


I've heard maybe stuff like meditation could help me training my brain into controlling my taught better (maybe even this subconscious songs playing 24/7), but I know nothing about meditation and dunno how to begin or any good resource or something like that, so I can give it a solid try, and not just a try and failing just because I can't do it the right way and convince myself that its not working.


I have no doubt that this whole addiction will be harder to tackle than what I've been through with my accident even know I nearly died. This is how much I'm dependent on it right now.


Also, I'm quite curious for the extreme cases on this sub such as myself, but of people that managed to quit to has how long it took before the withdrawal stopped, and where motivation and stuff like that starts to come back.


It's day 1 on stage 1 right now, And I'm struggling quite hard already.. 


I'm also open on other strategies even tho I'm quite pessimistic, about other ways. (especially if it means stop altogether completely. I legit fear for my life if I do that with my sleep issues). But I'm pretty open-minded so a good argument can change my mind.

The thing is I know weed wasn't good for my health and it's probably better to stay sober. On the other hand I remember how my life seemed better when I was still on it. I get a lot of positive feedback for the healthy changes I made and I'm keeping them up, but I just don't *feel* it.

I work out every day for half a year now as well and hope that some day I see the light and actually want to work out once a day. At the moment I force myself every evening to exercice, but there just isn't this good feeling everyone talks about. Also I don't see any optical progress, probably because I can't eat enough. This is partly because since I stopped weed I have slight chronic nausea and partly because I often just forget to eat. Hell, I'm actually hungry right now, which I totally forgot about.

But it's good to have no trouble with the police anymore. I was searched countless times in 2019 and hadn't I stopped smoking, they would definitely have found something on me.

Strangely I grow more and more apathetic. It's just like I don't feel like doing anything anymore. Well I do what I need to do, but not much more. Was bouldering last friday and my friends who invited me said things like ""this has to be fun for you"". Turns out I'm a natural talent, but it still wasn't fun. I don't even feel like drinking anymore, I mean what the hell?

Lastly I want to mention the ""flashbacks"" I get. Does anyone else have these intense feelings and trippy thoughts when thinking about weed for some longer? I hope I didn't damage my brain, because I actually thought after all this time of sobriety I should be a bit more clear-minded.

My sobriety is making a lot of people around me proud and I just try my best to do what's right for my mental and physical health as I think my body earned it after all this drug use. I just wished it felt healthier as well.",3

I’ve been smoking multiple times a day for at least 3 years now. I’ve smoked on and off since I was 14 (26 now). I love it. I’m always looking forward to each time I’m going to get to smoke again. My favorite thing is being high & laughing with my bf then eating anything I can get my hands on. 

Little backstory: I just moved to a new city 4 hrs away from my family & friends. This is my first time being out of my home town for more than a week. 

I’m stressed and depressed about all the changes that have happened in the past few months so this is why it’s been so hard for me to quit. 

Lately every day I wake up and it’s like I’m 9 months pregnant with a baby name ANXIETY. I feel it in my whole abdominal region. It’s like an empty black hole. My heart can’t stop fluttering and I just want to feel safe and warm. So I curl up in a ball and go back to sleep. I haven’t been getting out of bed before 9 lately. & once I’m up I can’t eat or be in a good mood unless I smoke. It’s like my coffee. All of a sudden I wanna clean, go to the gym, dance, be social, be productive.
BUT I always get that feeling, smoke more & now I’m too high to function, & I don’t get anything done. I smoked to much & now I’m anxious again and I can’t stop thinking about my insecurities & emotions. All I can do to make myself feel better at this point is curl up into a ball again and go back to sleep. 

I don’t want to live like this anymore. I’m pretty sure if I stopped weed I would be happier and more energetic. I’d wake up early and be productive and more clear. I’d be more present, I’d want to dress nicer and put on makeup, do my hair for once. I’d finally get to lose those 10 lbs I’ve gained from munchies.

I know I need to do why can’t I stop? 
My bf keeps insisting we switch to vapes and keep track of the proper dosage but I feel like I’m also addicted to the feeling of smoking. I also love the feeling of getting higher and higher. I perfect dose of indica would probably be good for my anxiety that I have naturally but it’s not the same. I love the ritual of smoking.
I’m high rn so sorry if I’m all over the place.

So I guess my question is: Has anyone tried micro-dosing? Would it be possible to micro-dose and only smoke heavy on weeknights/socially? Or do I just need to quit forever?",2

How did you guys get past this initial... desperation?","I'm not sure if 'desperation' is the right word, but that's what it feels like. 

I've been lurking this subreddit since January, when it became evident that my pot habit had turned into pot dependency. To keep the backstory short and sweet, I'm recovering from anorexia nervosa with binge/purge subtype, and separating from an extremely toxic family. These are relevant, because these are always my 'reasons'. I've lost count of the times my husband has reminded me that 'there will *always* be a reason' to keep smoking, or to 'just smoke today and stop tomorrow', and I've parroted back to him, 'Oh, I know. But this time I really mean it.' And I always do, in the middle of a craving, because that's what an addict does, right? They'll really mean anything as long as it means not having to quit right now.

In recovery for my eating disorder, we were taught that we have to mourn the loss of the good in order to separate completely from the bad. As stated above, pot has been my blanket cure-all for about three years now. It started as something to help with the pain and fatigue I was experiencing with the (then undiagnosed) auto-immune form of hypothyroidism, and for a while, it did. But I kept smoking all day, every day, because... well, to be completely honest, because I could. I am extremely fortunate, financially, as my husband is one of the rare few these days to have a secure job in a field that offers a six-figure salary for senior management. This has presented a problem, because it means that 'money' was never a factor in whether I should quit smoking or not - we don't have children yet, and are lucky enough to have enough disposable income that it never had to be. 

These days, pot is just... the answer. 'I really, really don't feel like eating today. I'll smoke so that I start craving something'. I even went through a phase using only edibles, because I thought (correctly, by the way, which may be worse) that having edibles in my system as the only way to get high would keep me from purging after a meal. When it became clear that my addict brother wasn't interested in his own recovery (the irony of which is not lost on me, I assure you), and that my narcissistic, enabling, codependent mother was more interested in the pity and sympathy she could get from advertising our illnesses, I used pot to numb all of the emotions I wasn't ready to cope with. It worked for a while, but now those emotions bleed through anyway. 

All of this is leading up to this: I am dedicated to recovering from my eating disorder, because I know that my life will not be as fulfilling (or long) if I am not. This same principle applies to pot. As I said, I've been lurking these posts for a while, and I've even bookmarked some to go back to to remind myself why I want to be that dedicated to recovering from pot dependency, too. My husband said something just the other day about how I don't value being in the present, and while I wanted to disagree with him (mindfulness is something I'm learning in therapy, and it is quite excellent, when I'm sober and able to focus long enough), it is true that I don't like sitting with these emotions. I know that therapy is going to help with the emotional aspect, and I've been reminded time and time again that the consistent 'happy' normal that will come is much more satisfying than the instantly gratifying 'high happy' that leaves you just as low as before. I can't imagine that I'm the only one that ever had these issues going on at the same time I'm attempting to stop being dependent on pot, and I *know* that life is going to be so much *better* when I can actually be present in it, because aside from dealing with issues that have been around since my teens, I must say I have a pretty good one (I don't mean this to brag, I simply mean to express that I am *genuinely* interested in being present in life again). So I'm here asking for help to get to Day 1 - for real, this time. Words of encouragement, advice on how to deal with withdraw in order to avoid relapsing for relief, or just general 'you got this' vibes would be very much appreciated. 

tl;dr: 'Day 1' is always tomorrow, because there's always a reason to smoke again. How did you guys deal with your 'reasons' and stick to seeing Day 1 through to Day 2?",7

I applied to a hospital over a month ago, didn't hear anything back. I called and asked about my application this morning and they basically told me not to expect a call. It wasn't a hard no, but they implied that I probably wouldn't be given an interview. I am 55 days sober, would pass a drug test atm, and completely devastated. This was my reason to quit. To get out of my shitty service job I've been stuck in for 5 years; to get a better, well paying job. And now I have to either find a new job that pays similarly (impossible, I'm a high school graduate with no specializations or certifications, THIS was the job that pays well that I'm eligible for), reapply and wait ANOTHER month (for them to potentially tell me no AGAIN), or say fuck it and go back to coasting, smoking, and being unhappy. 

Additionally I emailed FIVE therapist this morning. I have been contacting therapists for 3 damn months and every single one has no availability. No one has even ONE fucking appt available. For over 3 damn months. I'm just thinking, isn't asking for help and trying to get better ever going to fucking happen?? I am TRYING so hard to get better and NOTHING IS HAPPENING. Why is getting professional help so difficult??? This is some dumb fucking shit and I am beyond frustrated and angry and tired. I just keep getting kicked back down. Apparently I'm not allowed to get help, or have a nice job, or succeed at anything I try my hardest for. Fuck me, just completely fuck me

Made it 1.5 weeks the first attempt, made it 2 the second attempt, and I think I'm gonna make it a while this time. Only reason I relapsed this time was because I was sad I was alone on valentines day.

Weed didn't help though, sure I got that dopamine rush, and maybe escaped my sad thoughts for like 20 minutes, but once that initial high was over I was just high with endless thought loops about how I fucked up my last relationship, and how I'm alone, and how I make rookie mistakes when it comes to dating. By day three I had gotten so in my own head and ended up with so little self confidence that I canceled a 2nd date later that night because I was lazy and high and didn't want to put in the effort to attract a woman (wash, shave, clean my apartment, do laundry, think of interesting things about myself to talk about, basically be a functioning human being).

It was a very clear example of my lack of self control surrounding the instant gratification of weed, and how it can fuck up something that might take a little more effort but will make me a happier person overall. When I really think about it there seems to be a lot of examples of situations like this over my stoner tenure (ages 18-29), and I'm just a happier, funnier, harder working, more charismatic and overall better person when I'm not high. I like that guy better then the dude who is always baked up and just kinda there, and I'm excited to become him again.

Does quitting weed solve all my problems in life? No, but it does make me get bothered by them enough to actually try and do something about it.

Wihtout weed I will still struggle with dating, and my career, and eating right, and getting exercise, and feeling socially awkward, and understanding my emotions, and my place in the world... but at least I'm putting in the effort to figure this shit out instead of feeling bad about those things and constantly trying to escape them.

Getting high made me think I can just eliminate stress and anything I'm worried about for a while.... but all I was doing was putting off my problems and letting them manifest into bigger problems. I liked weed because I though it made things easy, but life wasn't meant to be easy baby, it was meant to be lived.",14

2020-02-24 08:57:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f8rk83/day_1_feelings_of_shame/,"Day 1, feelings of shame","19... Shame/inner criticism from MJ

Hi everyone! So, I’m currently 19, a sophomore at a local state school. I smoked MJ for the first time at a high school woods party when I was 17. Before then, I was SO against it. Growing up I was the kids who had the mentality of having fun without alcohol/drugs, and when I gave in to it that night, I felt shame and regret. I convinced myself in my head not to, and since then I’ve been an avid MJ smoker, I’d either hit a dab pen or smoke a bowl 5-7 times a week. 

Boy how my life has changed. I convinced myself I was schizophrenic, hearing these thoughts of shame and un-easiness in my head. Around a year and a half ago, I began to question every little thing I was doing when I was high in a paranoid/anxious way, and it began to affect my life even when I was sober. It felt like I had a second personality that took over my original one, that would just constantly beat me down (with my own thoughts in my head). Always telling myself I’ll stop one day, or that I’m never going to feel “normal” again, that I’ll always be in this state of paranoia and anxiety. I felt like my sense of humor left, my sense of understanding things... even to this day I’ll think about how I feel as though I’m not myself anymore, and I’d reminisce on days where having this sort of “second personality” voice in my head wasn’t a real thing. But then I begin to second guess wether this second personality is real, and I know it isn’t real, but then I think about the fact I’m thinking it, and it all goes downhill from there. 

But the good-news is I do feel grounded. Jesus has helped me tremendously. He’s shown me that I’m not the only one who feels like this and struggles with this (finding this sub-Reddit), and showed me that I wasn’t crazy, I was genuinely feeling these things and it all came from MJ. I’ve tried stopping multiple times, I’ll feel “normal” again, happy, I don’t think about thinking about how I think about having two different personalities (i overthink a lot when I’m high and I shame myself so much), and I’ll smoke again, only to bring up the same exact feelings. I never understood why I keep coming back, I just didn’t want to come to the terms that I was psychologically addicted. 

But from here on out I want to stop cold turkey. I want to be able to give my girlfriend my true self, I don’t want to keep fearing that I’ll never be able to truly be myself around her, and god-willing I want to marry her and be the best father to my kids. I feel like I smoked too much as my brain was developing and that I messed something up. But I don’t think I did, I just think I think I did. Anyways, I’m so glad I found this sub reddit and I’m so excited to start my journey. Thank you to anyone who read this whole thing, If you can relate/have any advice I’d love to hear it.

Like most high school students, thought nothing of it. This continued on weekends only up until I was 17 and started working full time. As time passed I began to smoke more and more. After a few months I was out of control, fully dependent, my relationships with family and friends went to hell. As my addiction progressed and my like became solely about getting high and being alone. My parents found a rehab and I was willing to go beside I had had enough, at least I thought I did. Fast forward 7 months later, June 2014, I graduate from rehab and come home sober. Life gets better but then things turn back to normal, reality sets in and I relapse. I’ve always struggled with fully accepting the fact that I am an addict because it’s “just weed” right? A few years would pass, I was attending AA meetings but never really participating. I would leave, come back and the cycle would repeat. July 2015, at this point I have 3 months sober, exactly. I had been hooking up with this girl and she called it off so not knowing how to react, the first thing I run back to is the weed. My problem is I always forget how bad it really was and is when I choose to use so I fantasize about the good times and I go  ack to it. It’s fun for a little while but then the crippling depression and desperate need to get sober returns. When I chose to return to using, I don’t eat, I lose weight, I isolate and hurt the ones I love, I feel hopeless and depressed, mentally and physically exhausted from thinking about getting high all the time. I decided to get sober for real this time and do it right, so October 2015 I return to AA/CA, got a sponsor the first meeting back, worked the steps over a month or so period and stayed clean and happy for 3 years. Life was life but it was 1000% better. I had control over my life and my emotions, I was emotionally and physically present and available. Relationships got better. In June 2016 I found the girl of my dreams and have been with her for the last 4 years. I went to school and got a diploma in welding. Got a full time welding job. Life was the best it had been in a long time. 

One summer day, July 2019, I start fantasizing about how lovely it would be to get high. Summer is actually a trigger for me. Something about the nice weather makes me want to het high. So the cravings kick back in and I try my best to fight it and ignore it, I continuously remind myself about the cons and how much better life is sober. Of course the addiction is much more powerful than I am. 2 days later I am buying weed from a classmate at school and getting high on my breaks. So here we are today, as I lay here and type this, fed up and sick of feeling so ill and sad. February 24th 2020. I’ve lost about 20 pounds since July. I don’t eat, I sleep until noon everyday day (I work 3:30-12am) I am so depressed and hopeless once again. I am getting high anywhere from 5 to 8 times a day. It is all I do. I have some good day where I don’t crave it as much and I can get high 2 times all day but those days are far and few between. I feel like I have lost myself, I don’t even feel like the same person. All my hobbies, everything I once was so passionate about it, it’s all gone. My life is work, getting high and sitting around at home. Nothing feels rewarding to me, I feel so numb. My depression has been getting pretty bad lately. I know the steps that I should take to get my life back, I have contacts from AA. There is just still that tiny part of my that doesn’t feel ready but everyday that passed, that will to quit grows. I am back to ignoring my loved ones, compulsively lying, manipulating.  This is my first reddit post and I finally found courage to try and reach out is some way and see if there is anybody else who can relate. Those whose life has been so negatively affected by heavy marijuana use. I am at my breaking point and am ready to take my life back. Any advice will be of help.

I've been best friends, totally inseparable from this girl, for over 10 years. At one point, she started smoking. At one point, she offered it to me and I finally accepted. And at one point, I was addicted to weed that was fully supplied to me by my best friend. 

I knew we were going in different directions, but I still wanted to hold on to her as my 'best friend.'

Quitting changed everything. She kept trying to offer me weed while I was quitting, I relapsed a few times but now I'm well and truly on the other side. Now, every time I see her she is short with me, like she takes my sobriety personally. 

I finally saw our friendship for what it is. A vain grasp at trying to hold on to the past, when I have big dreams and goals, and she feels threatened by them. This doesn't mean I'm judging her for where she's at, but I wish someone had told me earlier: 

It's okay to outgrow your friends, even your best friend.

Sobriety lifted the veil and made me see that truth, and while I am still grieving the friendship, I know in my heart it is time to let go. Weed was the glue that held us in place for far too many years. Finally I can move forward and grow.

On day 5 I had my first ever panic attack, which was probably a result of numbing my feelings with weed every day for over 2 years. Now, I’ve always been an anxious person but it was always situational and never debilitating like the anxiety I’ve been feeling.

While a big part of this is withdrawals and your nervous system being more alert in general - that’s what happens after you numb it for a while - you also have to put on some work and not just wait for it to pass. It will get better, but if you don’t learn techniques and create a plan for your anxiety recovery you can get stuck in the loop of panic and high anxiety, which can lead to a panic disorder. All it takes is one panic attack to disrupt your life and give you a disorder.

I’ve been reading a lot about panic and anxiety, and I’m also going to therapy to manage this and face it the best way possible. If you have any questions or if you need tips I’ll be happy to help, I’ve got a lot of good material from my extensive research and have been doing some things that have been working.

First of all thank you for the help and inspiration you all offer on this sub.

I have a question regarding quitting the herb.  First some background, I am in my early twenties and have smoked nearly daily for around 4 years.  I smoke in the evenings with my friends but when I dont meet up I smoke alone.  If im free during the weekend I will smoke all day.

I have come to realize that I have formed an emotional dependency on weed.  I have gone through periods of not wanting to do anything if it does not involve smoking.  I have thus decided that I need to stop smoking.

I started this journey in January, managed a full 17 days clean before I relapsed.  I started over, this time managing 8 days before smoking.  I am now 7 days since my last smoke.

My question is, has anyone here managed to go from full on addict to just enjoying a j once in a while to de stress abit? Or would you advise that cutting off completely would be best?

Thanks in advance for the help and if anything is unclear im happy to provide more info in the comments ☺️",4

I told her I was trying to take a break on smoking, or quit or whatever, and she told me she'd be there for me if I need someone and she'd be supportive and all that good shit. Felt really nice hearing that. Next night I ask to hang out cuz I'm not doing good and she goes out and drinks with her friends. Night after that, same thing. I'm sure she would be able to explain how it's different and I'm in the wrong. So I scrounged around and was able to pack several snaps in my bong to sit outside and watch netflix and smoke. Didnt make me feel any better at all. I thought it was supposed to make me feel better? 

I'm trying to not internalize it, and put less value in whether or not I have someone around to care about me. She says I'm being manipulative, but how am I supposed to feel about that? I can tell we just wont see eye to eye on this, and I wish I didnt have to beg to be cared for. Am I asking too much? I just want to see her and be normal so I can distract myself from feeling this way. I feel like a moron typing all this out to post here, so if you read it take it all with a grain of salt.

I really tapered down these past couple months (since November, I was only vaping .3-.6g each day, rarely a full gram), so I think I'm getting off kinda easy here.

I haven’t got it “all figured out” (who does!) so any other tips and comments welcome :) 

My story: 

Trying out therapy helped me realise and accept the harsh truth that I was using weed as a tool to escape my real problems. 

I used to tell myself that it’s just recreational, and what harm can it do? It’s not that physically harmful (I only did edibles and vape) and it makes me feel good. 

It really was great. When I was high, I went to my brain’s playground and it was a real candy land. It made me so happy to be alive, music sounded incredible, it made me creative and I thought I was mindful as fuck. 

But what I was probably doing for 2 years was avoiding reality because I didn’t like the things my brain was used to doing. I didn’t enjoy the things my sober brain came up with. 

I realised I have to deal with that first. I can’t keep running away from my problems and I can’t be high all the time. My sober brain had been telling me something and I kept ignoring it. 

I would like to go back to a time where I just truly enjoyed weed for the sake of having fun with friends or an occasional solo trip akin to going to the movies, nothing more. But I’m not ready to do that yet. 

Personal tips:

The tools I feel are most helpful to me right now are therapy, meditation and bullet journaling.

I don’t have clinical mental health issues but in all honesty therapy should be available for everyone and anyone. If you can afford it or are lucky enough to have it available for free, please try it out. Therapy helped me get to the roots of my problem, mainly related to self-esteem and fear of failure. You should know that some therapists are shit. If you feel they’re not helpful or not empathetic, stop seeing them. 

Bullet journaling was a surprisingly practical step-by-step way of making sure the things I do daily (at least partly) is intentional, and not a constant blurred struggle to ignore my worries. Self-reflection is definitely an important aspect. I was sceptical at first but it’s just something that worked really well for my messy disorganised brain. I track healthier habits now. I really recommend Ryder Ames’s book on the philosophy of bullet journaling (over time you create a practical journal system that works for you in the most practical sense). 

Meditation is hard to tell with making links with direct gains (apart from the fact that I feel a bit calmer on days I do it, although hard to distinguish the causal from correlation) but after 2 years of doing it on and off, I think I’m more aware of the state of my mind, and there are now more instances where I catch myself feeling or thinking something before I become consumed in it.",2

I've just finished my first week sober after roughly 3 years of chronic usage. Over the past year or so I've attempted to quit many times (and created various reddit accounts for this subreddit out of shame). I just wanted to check in to say I've finished my first 7 days sober!  


I'm on vacation so it has been quite easy to quit (I'm  in a country where I don't even think you could get it). The main reason I wanted to make this point was to underscore the importance of a change of routine or scenery in the recovery process. Over the past 7 days I've definitely thought about smoking, but the inability to acquire the goodgood (badbad) as well as the completely new environment around me have converted what would have likely been day-ruining cravings into simply a passing thought. I know not everyone can drop what they're doing and take a vacation but doing what you can from removing you from your typical triggering environment is so important- at least it was for me.  


It is hard to discern any specific benefits I've experienced over the past week because being on vacation certainly changes my routine and work and energy requirements ect.  


Anyways...I'm not sure what to say other than I KNOW that everyone on this subis capable of making the change because you're here, willing, learning, introspecting.  


Gotta run to breakfast- wishing you all the best on your journey! YOU CAN DO THISSSSSS",7

Dreams are incredible.","Today is the fourth day since stopping THC.  I had stopped unexpectedly Thursday morning due to a life insurance application which requires a medical exam.

Every day is a little clearer, a little more positive.  Yesterday I started working on weekend projects... so much to do, and I got a lot done in a day!  I'm dreading each non-THC day a little less.

Today is a tough one because my wife is working and I'm home alone -- stressing about my business.  This is the perfect storm for me grabbing that vape pen.  Nope... I can do this!

There's plenty to do today, and a busy week ahead, so I'm about to tackle my project list with a clearer mind.  I need to figure out how to exercise to deal with some of this stress, but that will come a bit later.  Still adapting to being THC-free.

I also confessed to my wife that I needed to take a break from THC.  (Some of you advised me not to hide it any longer -- thank you!)

Also, super-lucid dreams.  Wow, I didn't realize how much I missed them.  I can't remember them all, but I was on incredible adventures that would make James Bond jealous.  Except no hot women in them... LOL

2020-02-23 08:23:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f89dos/6_months_long_post/,6 months! Long post...,"So on the 29th I’ll be 6 months smoke free, wheres the time gone🤯 6 Months since the lowest week of my entire life. For some background I’m a 20 year old man, I smoked my first joint at 13 and for the first few times it didn’t reslly do too much until it became my life😂 Sneaking around after school getting stoned hiding it from parents and being friends with the older kids seemed so cool and everyone was saying weed has no downsides so how could things be better than that.

I kept that up for about a year where the love was always there and things were great then I just wanted to quit but couldn’t seem to because by then all my non smoker friends didn’t really want much to do with me because all I cared about was smoking. so I kept up doing it always half heartedly trying to quit but never really getting anywhere from 14-17 then in March 2017 I said I’ve had enough! Between March 2017 and October 2017 I only smoked 5 times then after October I put it down for good until April 2019.

In April I woke up really fancying a smoke, I’d already picked the cigarettes back up for the last couple and thought how much worse can weed be again I’ll just do it once. Well I think we all know where this is going, once became twice which became 3 times per week which then finally got to having maybe 1 none smoking day per week during which all I’d do was wish I was smoking. This leads us up to the worst week of abuse I’ve ever had, I was home alone for the entire week and all I’d do would be to smoke, I’d wake up at 6:30am feeling groggy and unable to go back to sleep so I’d smoke a joint and carry on throughout the day smoking joint after joint. The high feeling never came anymore it just didn’t do anything except bring panic attacks and fear, the day I quit I spent 2 hours lay on my bedroom floor terrified of the incoming heart attack I was sure I was having. Every breath hurt and I was sure it was the end so I decided it’s enough it’s no longer worth it and haven’t touched weed since and quit cigarettes again 4 days later. 

If my calculations are correct the past 6 months has saved me just over £1,000 of my use stayed the same and that doesn’t account for all the junk food that would have been bought as well.

I have a fantasy of how smoking would work out but it doesn’t go down that way so for that reason I will continue to become a person who can live a happy sober life and I wish that for each of you in here too. Thanks for anyone who read this far down👌🏻",2

Been sleeping around 1-2 hours every day, except on the third day when i am so tired i just collapse and sleep like 13 hours. Doesn't feel good.

Today though, i woke up at 09.00, after going to bed at 23. Waking up multiple times during the night, and always from these crazy ass dreams. Like, i've tripped on psychadelics before but these dreams are even more crazy than those trips. I must've had like 50 dreams last night, holy shit. Felt like an eternity.

But today - i feel really refreshed and it actually feels my body and brain did some good work on itself last night. Did have a lot of sweating, had to change sheets 2 times. Some other poster here mentioned the idea to keep a fresh set of sheets ready for this, and that helped me not wake up too much, and especially with the feeling that ""this sucks"". I just did it and went back to sleep. Not a lot of thoughts around it. 

It can only get better from here. I am a little nervous for tonight, but feeling optimistic in general :)

Stay strong everyone, and when you feel like hell and are thinking of going back to your old ways (especially in the first couple of weeks) remember: This too will pass. It will get better. You owe it to yourself to let your body and mind heal.

This is my first post on this sub, and really there are two reasons for it. 

1. This may help others just like all the other posts helped me.
2. To solidify my intentions by making a post (this is personal way to mark my commitment)

I have been smoking for about more than 11 years now and I have tried to quit twice already but I convinced myself that I was ok to start using again both times. I made the mistake of thinking I can control my usage and some of you may know by experience that tolerance grows and you intake more and more to reach the same level of high. Also, I would mix tobacco with my weed so I got hooked to nicotine too and I would smoke regularly, although I was never a heavy smoker (max 5 a day). I would always mix my green with tobacco I wouldn't smoke it otherwise as the high was not strong enough for me. 

Anyways, long story short I have decided I am done with it all, I quit smoking period. No weed, no cigarettes or any form of tobacco. I am on day 5 currently and other than me losing my appetite (which i know will return in a bit), I feel better and its getting better and it's getting better day by day. This time I am serious, on day 3 I threw out everything I had (weed, smokes and any paraphernalia). Now towards the end of day 5 I am making this post as a gesture of my commitment to quitting. 

Thank you to this sub and to all the leavers who shared their experiences and knowledge. You guys have helped me realize I don't need any substance to feel better. Its time to take control of my life!

Stay strong, we got this.",2

On a side note I also discovered that I was basically throwing a wrench into my relationships (choosing weed as my only one) as well as my new company I have started...looking at documents like what in the actual ^$&#>×>@& was I doing. Additionally I have also found that most things have become so much easier...I ride a motorcycle for example and almost every time I went to take the seat off and put the battery in or hook it up to my trickle charger I would end up swearing like the pirate gypsy I am....I used weed to throw a monkey wrench into my life. I jumped on my bike today and put the battery in fully charged and the seat back on within seconds. I then took the best ride I have ever taken.

I thought to myself, ""someday I will join"", but I kept delaying my addiction, degrading my memory, wasting my health away.


I've been having a lot of respiratory symptoms for two years now. It's either asthma or chronic bronchitis, as my pulmonologist is yet to diagnose me properly. The only thing I'm certain is that I need to quit, or I'll risk facing serious complications soon. There has never been a primer time. 


I've been on and off for the last months. Some weeks I don't smoke, some days I don't smoke. I'm trying.


But the truth is, I always return due to anhedonia. This apathy and lack of enjoyment towards everything is nauseating, and makes me question my life, my job, my capacities, everything. I realize now that it's the real motive for my addiction, the need to feel, to feel at all, through an artificial mean. It will make me fail again, most probably, and I wish I knew how to cope with it.


But no matter how hard it is, I know that I have to quit now.


I'll be around now. I'll be finally leaving.",3

One full month since I discovered this sub and quit within hours. I have two week chips for MA but two weeks ago after a meeting some guy came up to me and commented on my share asking if my degree was still possible (I explained that I had changed my degree track so I get an MA instead of an Mdiv) and what my job prospects looked like. I am currently taking time off to focus on my recovery. Now is the right time for recovery. However tonight the same inner voice is saying tonight is a good time for a little relapse. 

On the street when I was picking up dinner I smelled weed. I saw people smoking before I smelled it. First a group of kids, boys aged 17-20 passing a joint between them as they walked. It was a fattie. Looked beautifully rolled. I really held back being that creepy older lady asking for a hit. NYC has enough creeps. Then on the way home there was another guy, a grown man this time smoking alone. Both times I just reveled in their smoke trails. The scent was euphoric. After my first week of MA I gave away all my flower and edibles but I still have two rolled joints in my house. I just want to smoke them and go to sleep and start fresh tomorrow. Trying to hold off. 

Feel like I’m Princess Leia saying “help me Obi-wan Kenobi” but I also don’t know how bad a relapse would be after this long. 

31 days is the longest I have gone in 10 years.

Update: i showed this post to my partner and he found the two joints and flushed them. I hate waste but appreciate him. Also dumped the rotten cannaoil I had in my fridge. Going to MA tomorrow at noon. 31 days seemed good for a relapse but at least this way I can get a 1 month chip this week.",8

I have an amazing boyfriend who has been there for me since we met 3 years ago. He isn't scared of my manic episodes or my suicidal ideations when I am depressed. 3 weeks ago I had my first psychotic crisis for an antidepressant that I was prescribed and I shouldn't have, because that's what happens when a bipolar person takes antidepressants, and my boyfriend moved in for a few days until I recovered (it took 2 weeks). He has been loving and supporting and he is a keeper. I love him to death.

Here is the conundrum. He smokes weed every day. He self medicates, it is obvious to me. But he thinks he enjoys it and that there is absolutely no problem at all with it. He rolls a blunt every evening and we smoke it together. The shit has so much THC that I fall asleep on the sofa every evening. 

I have a new psychiatrist and he also, as did the previous one, asks me to go off marijuana or reduce it as much as I can. Nobody knows how my mood stabilizers and antipsychotics interact with marijuana. 

I tried for one week, went cold turkey, and I had terrible anxiety and felt just horrible. Nauseous. My therapist told me I should not do it cold turkey, to have a plan about leaving it little by little.

But I love smoking with my boyfriend. He smiles at me and asks me if I want to smoke, and all I want to say is YES, MY LOVE! He puts the blunt between my lips and he lights it looking into my eyes. We have this ritual, says my therapist. We need to substitute it for something else that will be our new ritual, without weed.

I feel it is asking myself to do the impossible. I already do so many things to handle my bipolar disorder! I don't drink alcohol, don't eat sugars, go to sleep every day at the same time, wake up at the same time, take a ton of pills, deal with the side effects, practice mindfulness for bipolars, walk every day an hour and a half and a ton of other healthy lifestyle measures to keep me as stable as possible. I feel exhausted, and adding this issue (trying to get off weed) seems like asking myself too much...

Anyway, that's how I feel today...",23

I posted here a few months ago about being roommates with daily smokers and the struggles I've been facing trying to quit while it's constantly around me, and since then I've realized that isn't going to change. Even if I move out, the majority of the people I interact with are consumers. So I'm doing it anyway. It's about controlling my own actions and holding myself accountable, not about the people in my life who smoke - it's my addiction, not theirs and I'm going to have to find ways to be around weed without caving. (tips are more than welcome!!)

I'm tired of being tired, I'm tired of my throat hurting and my thoughts being clouded. I've been smoking daily for 3 years and I figure even if I can go a week without it, it'll be an accomplishment. 

Most of my Saturdays are spent sleeping all day, waking and baking, then playing mindless videogames or watching youtube, eating junk and doing the *bare* minimum. Today I walked my dogs twice and bathed them, went out for breakfast with my Dad, did laundry, cleaned my room, and had time to relax without feeling like I couldn't focus, so I got to play that other, really complicated video game that I usually don't have the brain capacity to focus on. That may sound like less-than an average day for most of you, but weed had me smitten. I was perfectly fine wasting away my Saturdays, and every other day, I guess. I convinced myself that I could totally function high, so that's what I did for the past 3 years. Went to class, work and even the doctor's office blazed out of my mind because hey, if my grades aren't dropping and my boss doesn't notice, what's the harm right? Guess I never thought about the stunted emotional-development and mental health issues I was obviously avoiding by doing so, especially because I started as a teenager. Weed used to be something that eased my anxiety and took the pain of the day away and now, It only makes me think of that pain, pushing my anxiety through the roof. Funny how our virtues can turn into vices.

Anyways, I'm unbelievably thankful for this subreddit because even though it took me months to finally quit, seeing posts about other leaver's struggles and successes through this process has encouraged me to finally take the leap myself. So thank you to all of you who are posting here, It's really nice to hear that I'm not alone, even though I'm sad that I'm not, because it's a really shitty thing to deal with. Good luck and much love  <3

Any tips for the days ahead (the first few days suck the most from what I've heard) or how to actually SAY no when offered would be much appreciated :)",2

I'm pretty sure it's mainly down to not looking after myself properly with regards to my jobs and bad exercise routine (aka didn't have one) more than paws etc but it's a thing for me for sure. Been trying to add in yoga and meditation with some success actually. And I spent some of my money saved by not smoking on buying a spike mat after a recommendation from someone on here and this has been a great investment for sure. Relaxes me and helps my back I think #winning

So the weed... No urges. Don't really think about it. If I get triggered is the only time I think about it so I'm just being mindful of that cos even down the line I still need to keep resolute and never be complacent. So really, I'm over the habit for sure and just need to keep myself frosty for hidden speed bumps in the road. But don't we all?

But yeah, waking up is actually pleasant now and even sleeping is getting easier. 

But yesterday half way through the day I just felt shit. I don't know what happened but I just got sad. I've got other things going on in my life so it could've been that but I found myself getting back into bed just feeling miserable and off. 

I was about to lie down and just give in to it when a voice popped into my head.

""Don't be that person. It's 5pm. Get up. In fact, go to the gym.""

I joined the gym an hour later. 3 days ahead of my original ""soft target."" 

I don't know who I am anymore but I like this person. She's actually doing things again. She's not wallowing. She's going places. And she thanks you for reading and wishes you all, all the strength you require in your own journies.

As always, stay strong and keep at it ❤️

I like this energy and wonder how i wasted all these years allowing myself to get fooled with the lies that weed tells you “you have a problem? Dont worry just take a hit and it will go away” yeah fuck that, id rather deal with these problems rather than them getting accumulated, and also it made me lose my girlfriend of 3 years and i feel so motivated on winning MYSELF back first, then her.

I've exhausted any opportunity to get fronted or borrow money from a friend or anything like that. Won't pinch my moms stash and I've told my small circle of friends I gotta quit for a while. I'm currently looking for a job, hopefully something outside my normal food industry bullshit routine.

This is Day 0. Why am I still doing this? Weed has brought me so much more harm than good.

-----

At 14, I started smoking because I was curious. The people that had it were funny, seemed interesting, knew how to have a good time. So I went to a hotel party and my parents busted me. Why continue?

Because as a minor in high school, everything seems so much more exciting when it's forbidden fruit. I'd buy, get busted, get grounded and clean up, then come back to it again after running into some money. Those days were turbulent - my dad was a bipolar mess, I wasn't of sound mind myself, and my mother was so high-strung trying to keep it all together.

I graduated, went off to university for a year. I dropped out due to those extenuating circumstances. Away from home, I had no idea what my father's mental state was like, until my mom confirmed that they were divorcing. Regardless of what she tried to do to help my father, he would resist, go cavorting and spend money he didn't have, and do what he does best - argue someone down to a whittle. She had had enough.

I had had enough, too. I was in a dorm with 3 frat brothers, taking wash-out classes I didn't care about, in a major I was forced into taking, in a gigantic school that kept me more as a number than a person. Of course I smoked the pain away. Of course I stopped caring about school. I didn't even muster up the effort to apply for a mental health leave. I just let it drag my GPA down, along with me.

I came back to my old house after winter break. It was virtually empty. Both parents had stopped living there.

After dropping out, I stayed in Orlando for the summer - too broke to smoke, but tried to anyways. That was the most depressing summer of my life. Getting high didn't make me happy at all. It made me suicidal, made me want to end my woes despite having no means. Near the end of my sublease, I smoked inside the room (against rules, duh) and played ""13 Angels Standing Guard 'Round the Side of Your Bed"" on a loop. No one came to check on me as I cried for the night, letting rain soak the carpet underneath the window, wanting very much to die and feeling as worthless as I possibly could.

I moved back in with my mother, exhausted from the proceedings, ready to stumble forward with our lives. Things stabilized. I started seeing a therapist consistently and got on antidepressants that actually *worked*. I got my associate's degree from a community college and started forward at another with a focus on becoming a technical writer. I didn't really have any means to smoke. I had odd jobs here and there, but school took the forefront.

In 2018, things took a turn for the worse for my mental health. School became stressful, and I took a trip to the Philippines during one of the most important parts of the semester. My mother coerced me - it had been planned before the semester began, and she insisted that it had been too long since I had visited the homeland. It was her high school reunion, after all.

The trip ruined me, essentially. Something about what I had been studying standing against the stark contrast of a confused nation just jumbled up my soul. I'd walk into a supermall, see a 100 foot tall poster of a white-presenting model, with its slogans in half-Tagalog, half-English. I'd make my way out feeling guilty about my American privilege just to look out the window of the car and see Filipinos, in their brown skin, hanging laundry from wires attached to tin shacks, no more than 100 yards away from the supermall. I'd go to a private island with people several generations detached from me, speaking a language I should know from my ancestry, and watch them feed spaghetti and soda to the impoverished children of the island for a picture opportunity. I'd see a man standing on bamboo pipes to paint a building, three feet away from lethal power lines, for a peso worth 2 cents of an American dollar.

If the trip didn't make me mentally sickened, the flight back definitely made me physically sickened. A man sitting in front of me took his surgical mask off while coughing for 12 hours. Cosmic luck.

I missed two more weeks on top of the three I had already missed of school, and I wanted to drive my car into a ditch more than anything else. My therapist heard this and institutionalized me.

-------

Fast forward to 2019. I've taken proper medical leave from school, and my professors all understood. I'm stabilized, working out, not smoking - then I found a job, ironically enough, at a drug store. This coincided with a trust fund my grandma had left me, a small sum of around $1,000. This was withheld by my father's side of the family for 3 years after she died. 

Naturally, I started smoking again. Let's fucking celebrate, I'm back to normalcy! 

2020 comes around. My mom takes me on a trip to Nevada (not to gamble, but to visit family), and since pot is fully legal there, I indulge as much as I can under my family's nose. 

Fast forward to February. 

That trust fund is all but evaporated and I'm smoking at least 2g a day. I've stopped progress on all self-improvement and healing I needed from the past decade, just to throw it away on a substance. One I never needed, one that made me feel goofy and euphorically dizzy at best, and downright suicidal and paranoid at worst. 

Just for an 8-pt period at 3am, in false hopes that I touch what I did a decade ago with some other teenagers I've long since lost contact with. 

I hope I can recognize my addictive personality and channel it for the better, instead of putting blinders on for some temporary bliss that hasn't been there in years.

I hope I survive leaving it all behind.",10

I stopped because even if it stopped my stress temporarily, it was more detrimental in the long run in that, even if it helped me calm down enough to do school work, I would spend the next 6 hours or so after finishing it just smoking and slacking off when I had lot's of other work to do. Then I would sleep in then next morning, skip lectures because of grogginiess, etc.

Can't remember the last time I was sober this long, so I guess I can be proud in that, but even then life doesn't suddenly get better, and all the bad grades and habits from when I was high are still there weighing on me.

I’ve lurked around here occasionally over the past few years whenever things were getting a bit more stressful and chaotic in my life, but haven’t posted until this point. I hope my experience will help some of you and at the very least avoid doing any damage. 

Let me start off by saying, I am still addicted to marijuana. There isn’t a day that has passed over the past 10 years where I haven’t thought about it. Every time my anxiety kicks in or stress starts building, that crutch is the first place my mind goes. 

I smoked daily for more than 10 years before my job decided to start requiring drug tests. Quiting cold turkey out of nowhere was a bit of a bitch, but it wasn’t worth my livelihood to risk going back. As I had already drifted away from the crowd I used to smoke with, once I broke the chain to my dealer, life got quite a bit easier for awhile. Even if I made the choice to go back, I didn’t have any easy connections. I also started working out, met my future wife, got married and had a couple kids. My family gives me even more incentive to avoid marijuana as I know one taste would likely have me hooked as hard as I ever was. 

Things got tougher for me when legalization started up. Suddenly I’m surrounded by so many options to obtain the forbidden fruit that I crave daily. Every where I go, everything I do is still a reminder of what I can’t have. But the thought of even risking my career or my family shuts it all down in a heartbeat. 

I’ve also started opening up to my doctor over the past few years about the anxiety I was self medicating. She has me on a combination of a few medications to dull the panic attacks. None of it comes close to what my memory of marijuana did for me... but it’s at least tolerable. 

I guess if I had any advice to give to you all, it would be to find something more important to you than the weed and hold onto it for dear life. The more things in your life that outweigh your gluttony for marijuana, the easier it is to avoid going back. But if you’re realizing that you’re an addict like me, while things do get easier, I don’t think the craving will ever completely go away. Prepare yourself for that and be ready to continue the fight no matter how long you’ve been away. There will always be those triggers in your life that snap your mind into marijuana mode and you have to constantly ground yourself to avoid them. 

As for me, I really don’t know what the future brings. Part of me always longs for the day when my employer stops testing for marijuana. The other part of me is terrified over becoming a bad father or husband. If and when that day comes, I know I’ll have a place here to help keep my ship going in the right direction... and if any of you need tips/advice/or an ear to listen from someone who has been walking this path for a decade now, I’m here for you.",18

I’m beyond blessed to have had the realization as young as I did. Because of the lifestyle change I’ve decided to commit too; I will save a ton of money and maintain motivation for my long term goals.

Some days have been tougher than others. I’ve lost “friends”, burned some bridges, and had periods of doubt, but I’ve stayed on course. I know this is the best decision I’ve made in a long time and I fully intend on sticking to it.

50 days pales in comparison to some of your accomplishments, but I try to not focus on the numbers. Too me, 50 days is a tremendous achievement, considering this is the longest I’ve been THC free since I was 15. I would like to thank this sub for comforting me during times of doubt, and applauding me during periods of joy. We truly are all in this together. Whether you’re on day 1 or day 1,000 we are in the same boat regardless. This journey can be really really tough sometimes. It’s beaten and battered me in ways i couldn’t imagine but I overcome it each time, and walk away from that challenge a stronger version of myself. Weed may not be for everyone, sobriety may not be for everyone, but I know for a FACT that the choices I make today are entirely the right decisions for ME, and me only. That’s what really matters. Most importantly (and this is my pure opinion) I would like too thank God. Thank you for being my biggest confidante, my most loyal companion, and best friend. Bless up you guys! I’m on my way to Mt. Hermon as I write this so I won’t be back til this Monday. I am going to enjoy my surroundings, spend time with my family, and live through these next days Weed Free - the way it should be.

I caved last night due to a week of helping out my family and working hard, I felt I deserved a reward, so I got my old dry herb vape and got my partner to give me a tiny amount and I vaped it. What a shock I got, how was I addicted to this stuff??

All I ended up getting was ever so slight mental images that weren't actually visuals, no euphoria or even the giggles and a very sleepy bored feeling, it is SO much less enjoyable than I remember, like deciding to watch a tv show only to look away every time a key plot point comes up so you have no idea what is going on.

It wasn't even worth it and now writing this over 16 hours later I still feel groggy and fuzzy, when I would usually be awake and alert and doing stuff by now (midday). Also my sociability which I had been working on is totally gone again, it sucks. Y'all have the right idea on quitting for life, I'm not gonna beat myself up over this, though now I'm remembering all the brain fog and awful sweats I had when quitting.

Guys if you get cravings don't give in like I did, it definitely isn't enjoyable once you're this far and previously the longest I had gone without smoking was just under 2 weeks.",4

I'll start with the question though: anyone else have random head rushes that feel like being high for a few moments? It's driving me nuts and idk if it's normal. 

Now, my experiences thus far: 
I quit 5 days ago after a decade of very heavy daily smoking. I had just broken up with someone I still love very dearly because I'm in a very bad position in life right now and was prioritizing a relationship over bettering myself. Then came the realization I was doing the same with weed. 

For years, I had skipped out on family events, education opportunities, living opportunities, and even flushed a political career down the drain because my priority was to be able to smoke weed all day every day. 

I have untreated borderline personality disorder, adhd, insomnia, and sciatica. I kept rationalizing things to myself as ""well, I need to self medicate bc medications are too expensive in the US"". 

I'm unemployed currently (and may have lost an opportunity due to a failed drug test) and will have to remain unmedicated for up to a year because the industry I'm in it's standard practice to go through a temp agency for 6-18 months until officially hiring you on and offering benefits and all that. 

This is the hardest part of it, most definitely. I haven't properly dealt with these feelings in over a decade and they keep hitting so intensely. Yesterday this resulted in a breakdown/anxiety attack so intense I thought I was literally dying. I called my mom and she helped calm me down but the feelings are still weighing down on me.

I've been lying in bed for last 2 hours trying to get the motivation to get up and make some tea and the difficulty in starting that tasks has allowed me to truly reflect on why else I should quit

1. I really miss dreams. I used to have vivid dreams and even a reoccurring nightmare that would come every year or so...havent had that dream in over 3 years 
2. I'm broke as fuck. I probably spend around 300 monthly on weed alone -_-
3. I need the energy and motivation to start a new a hobby and weed greatly prevents that
4. I simply no longer want to rely on weed to get me through the day, especially since my life is rather uneventful regardless

Just wanted to post here to say a few things I've noticed so far.


1) the reason I used to abuse weed is the same reason I don't get out of bed in the morning, or spend too much time playing Xbox, or watch porn, or browse YouTube. 


2) that reason manifests itself in multiple forms, but the underlying commonality is a *desire for instant gratification*. It's like a closed loop that creates a downward dopamine spiral.


3) since I've quit smoking, I've been able to see how my addiction manifests itself in different forms of ""easy-buttoning"" if you will, and that the only way to break the cycle is to spend my time on delayed gratification activity rather than instant gratification activity. Another way to say this is to spend more time creating/producing and less time being passive/consuming.


Over the next 100 days, my goals are to land a full-time job that pays at least $60,000 per year in my desired field, start a YouTube channel to document my progression through life and release the content I'm producing, to find a place to live for the next year, and to start dating again.


And the secret tip I have is very simple... when we relapse it's not always easy to determine WHY we relapsed. But in my experience, the fundamental truth of why we relapse is *because we want to relapse.* 


It can seem like it's due to an external factor or a persistent emotion, but at the end of the day, there's a very real part of you that wants to smoke despite another very real part of you that recognizes the negative impact it has on your future (and has had on your past).


""the only reason I relapse is because I want to relapse.""


Please don't use this as a reason to relapse, btw.


This has helped me cut out the mental chatter and keep things simple.


Otherwise, some blind, ingrained part of my hindbrain clings to the idea that smoking one more time isn't a big deal.


Also! Marijuana Anonymous has been a great way to stay ahead of urges, and Vipassana meditation has shown me basically how my mind operates. I went on a 10day silent meditation retreat and was blown away as to how much it relates to the addictive aspects of my personality.


I think that about does it, hope this helps in some way.

I am 29, married, and a graduate student. Last month I finished a 3 month CBT group therapy course for Cannabis abuse. I was a standard daily smoker, no need to elaborate, you all understand. Anyway, at the end of this therapy course I realized that, in order to take my recovery seriously, I need to go on medical leave from my graduate program. Stress from my PhD program has been a major reason for my smoking, so I kinda need to step back for a little while. There was a lot of anxiety and doubt about doing this, as it was essentially confessing to the world that I have a serious problem. But I'm feeling really positive about it. I am 2 weeks sober, but the cravings are hitting me hard. However, I feel that if I am going on leave, I can't fuck this up. If I use these next 3 months as an opportunity to smoke unimpeded, I will be so deeply disappointed in myself. But if I use these next 3 months to exercise daily, reconnect with friends, explore a new hobby (warhammer!), and read for fun, I will be able to return to my studies a better person.

I finally want to recognize that I'm so privileged. I have a wife who makes money, and a university program that allows me to take medical leave. I live in a country that has offered me free CBT therapy for marijuana. I am in a professional environment that doesn't shame me for admitting I have a problem. On the contrary, I have received nothing but encouragement for taking my recovery seriously. You guys and gals out there that don't have this sort of privilege are fighting a harder fight, and I have nothing but respect for you all. We are all heroes striving mightily against a grim enemy. But while I am flanked on either side by supporting forces, some of you fight alone and with no course of retreat. Fight on lone hero, I will sing of your deeds. The victory will be all the sweeter.",1

This is my first time posting on reddit and I just would like to share my experience on quitting weed. Today marks my 3 weeks sober and it’s been an amazing but yet scary journey. I have been smoking for 4 years since I live in California and now I’m in the United Kingdom. I have smoke almost every strain in every form possible and I would go through an ounce in 1 week easily. 



<Usage>/ I would smoke after a heavy night of drinking at the club in order to sleep. Put in mind I go to the club almost every week and I would call myself a heavy drinker because I can drink up to a bottle of champagne by myself in one night or 13 shots of whiskey just the other day. 



<Realization>/ I decided to quit because I had a really bad experience one night going home in an Uber where I started to panic and vomited 3 times when I got home. I got so paranoid and i thought I was actually gonna die. So far I have experience a few panic attack where I got the cold sweat and chills. A few time I vomited when I started to panic. The migraine hit me 2 days ago and it hurts really bad. Loud sounds and bright light made my vision all blurry and I need to be in dark quite room. Sometime I feel that I’m not myself in a way I use to be and it’s scary. I can’t seem to feel my body like all my senses are gone. 



<Daily Life> / When I was at the gym with my PT, she told me I seem to be lost when we were doing our sets and I would find it hard to focus on trying to find words to describe how I feel. I’m scared to be alone at home so I always have to stay at my friends house to feel like if something were to happen to me. I would have someone there to look after me. Sitting in class I would find it hard to focus as the slides seems blurry and the professor speech seems to be squeaky. I always have to wear my Apple Watch to measure my heart rate so I won’t feel like I was having heart attack.   


<Self Care>/ I try meditation and listening to calm music to relax myself and take my mind off the weed but it doesn’t help that much. I always want to go see doctor but I know it’s just me scaring myself and they won’t find anything. I was in the Emergency room 3 time last year for acid reflux so I know it’s just the heart burn that is making me panic wanting to go see the doctor. My head is always tense for some reason like it’s gonna explode. 



<Silver Lining > / The only good things that happen since I quit is that I am more social and productive. I find myself doing things that I would otherwise procrastinate about. My appetite got better day by day and I would actually enjoy eating food without being high. 



<Comment and Suggestion>/ If you guys have any suggestion on how to improve my symptom about anxiety, panic attack, depression, acid reflux and etc. please do let me know and I will definitely try it out. I just want my normal life back when none of these issue happen. When life was simpler and everything was perfect. Now I can’t go through a single day without thinking I might have a panic attack.",3

I've always been a lightweight. One puff from a small bowl or one 2-3 second vape pull and I'm set for the day. The last 1 oz. bag of flower I bought literally lasted me for 2 years!

My personal reason for smoking was that it relaxes me, energizes me and lets me tackle tedious jobs that I would otherwise avoid (spreadsheet analysis, file workflow, cleaning up the office and kitchen). In some ways, a little smoke seemed to make me a better person -- more creative, and more industrious. I always kept my use very low-key, and nobody really knew about it. Spouse knows I smoked, but she didn't really know when or how often.

My use was almost always when I'm alone. I run a small business, with lots of hours when I'm the only one in the office. Or if my wife was working on a weekend day, I'll have a smoke and do projects around the house. 

I started to see the downsides.  One problem is that I used to exercise, but with regular usage, I basically lost all desire to exercise.  Problem is I'm always thinking about smoking. When is my next smoke gonna be? If I had an appointment in the evening (I serve on several local boards and a civic club) I wouldn't smoke during that day, but I would always be waiting for the next smoke. I started to worry my use could be problematic.

I completed a life insurance application yesterday, and they said ""all we need now is your medical exam. They will do a blood test and urine test."" I acted dumb and non-specifically hinted about how they handle marijuana use, and they said the urinalysis does check for marijuana use. If positive, they will increase rates to that of a tobacco user.""  

Maybe this is the reason I need to stop using (meanwhile I will attempt to delay the insurance med exam). This could be a good thing for me, considering that I think about it ALL the time. I just don't know how I will manage . Should I go see a shrink? Should I tell my wife? Other programs?

It's about ""drugs, addiction, and other dumb shit"". I heard about it when listening to a repeat of a This American Life episode.

It's a dark comedy thing, especially for ""this addict"" who has spent decades addicted to drugs. 

It's hosted by people in recovery and they have guests who are in the same boat. The hook is that they tell stories about all the dumb and wild things they did while addicted and while bouncing in and out of sobriety.  

The hosts stress that it's not a podcast about recovery, but about the wild ride of addiction.  It's counterintuitive, but it seems to be helping me to keep my mind in the right place. There are so many people who have struggled with repeated false starts towards sobriety.

I have definitely relapsed my fair share of times. The hosts and guests of the podcast are often talking about relapses. One thing that has come up a few times is that once you get a good block of sober time, it's very hard to enjoy the high once/if you relapse.  Partly because you have experienced how much easier and nicer things can be when sober.  

I have experienced the same thing. I have effectively ruined the high by enjoying sobriety so much.  During my relapse last summer, the high was only good just before or as I inhaled. As soon as it hit my system, the regret kicked in deeply. I was stuck in that cycle for a few months. 

With all of this in mind, I am seeing any moments of temptation in a different light lately. It's very clear to me now how getting high again would turn out. 

There is a big spoiler to this podcast that I am already aware of. It was actually what intrigued me the most about it when I heard the This American Life ep. I won't call it out here, but it's a doozy. I started at the beginning Dopey episode and I am working my way forward. I am on ep 63.  I think the big thing happens in the mid 100s.

Anyways, here is to another week of the easier nicer way of life.

Because every time I attempted to quit before I've complained of horrible brain fog and lack of my normal motivation. Only 9 days of nofap and I woke up today and began hitting my ab roller (normally my least favorite activity ever), cleaned my room, made my bed, and made breakfast all before 7:30 in the morning. THAT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME!!! I mean when I was living with my family and sober for six months and eating super healthy gourmet food this never happened to me.

Sleep has been mixed but I thought it was getting better, until last night when I woke every 30 mins with crazy anxiety. 

I've read lots of posts on here over the past week or so and it's been a great source of strength, you guys are good people. The reason I started smoking, like a lot of people I guess, was to forget/ignore some of my problems. 

Nobody knows I smoked, not my family, friends and most importantly my SO. For the past 18 months I've been getting stoned daily behind her back. I feel terrible about this and is one of the major motivators for me stopping, the other is I had a major bout of anxiety bordering on a panic attack the week before I quit and it scared the shit out of me. Unfortunately this also means I have nobody to talk to about what I'm going through and find it difficult to explain why I'm now acting irrationally with anxiety and trouble sleeping. I know some people may say tell her but I don't think it would be a good idea as I've basically been lying to her for the past 18 months. We have been together for 13 years and on the whole our relationship is very good. This means I'm coping with everything on my own and trying to hide some of the withdrawal symptoms.

I'm having problems with motivation since I quit which really sucks as even stoned I would get stuff done, I exercise 5 days a week. It's her birthday on Sunday and we have drinks planned on Saturday night with friends and then stuff with our families on the sundays. Shes a great woman and I don't want to fuck this weekend up for her but I'm struggling with energy and motivation.

I'll shut up soon I promise. The last thing I wanted to say is that the problems I was smoking to forget are still here now which is one of the hardest parts, creating a lot of anxiety. Compared to some on here most of my problems are very small but keep going round and round in my head. I'm hoping withdrawal is amplifying all of this but who knows. I'm just really feeling quite lost, very scared and alone in all of this at the minute.

I spent most of my time on it during the first two weeks after having quit. 

I remember feeling like an imposter, wasting people's time. I never thought I'd make it. 

The sweating, the anxiety, the insomnia, the roller coaster of emotions (feeling fine, then sobbing uncontrollably for no reason out of nowhere)... they all seem so far away now.

I can't believe I wasted **15 years** of my life because I was too scared to get through **two difficult weeks**. How much time, how much money wasted because of this? But that's no longer of any matter.

My entire adult life revolved around weed, and now the only time I think about it is out of habit (most often during a lull in the day when I usually sparked one up). When I think of it, I don't even feel a longing for it.

I'm remaining vigilant -- now is not the time to ""treat myself"" with a joint because I can ""handle"" it, nor do I think it ever will be. But honestly, the temptation isn't even present. I'm too happy with my life, how I feel. I love seeing the ""days sober"" counter on the application increase with every pledge. 

My life is far from perfect. I still have so many things to deal with, to cope with, to get done. But weed is no longer one of them. 

I never thought I'd make it this far, and I know I can make it even further.

**Don't be afraid to quit.** It's tough -- brutal, even -- in the beginning. But once you emerge, you can't even imagine how much you'll feel it was worth it. 

Don't fear the first few weeks. They will be but a distant memory once you make it to the other side.

I am nothing but eager for what is to come. I hope those of you starting your journeys will join me one day, because boy is it bright over here.",40

I wrote a pros/cons list of why I should quit and analysed my triggeres (boredom mostly). I wrote two more entries after that and then plunged into a deep weed binge forgetting all about it until now, February 21st 2020... I still haven't quit but I have now found r/leaves and im hoping that I can finally share my struggle... I suppose this post is already me committing to doing this for good... (I hope).

I was digging around my old notes and found one from April 2019... it was a note I made to commit to quitting weed and to track my progress. Before that I had lingered for 6 months writing down why I should quit (BUT NEVER DID). So I realised that it's been well over a year that I have been trying to quit weed and never had a successful week without smoking up... rereading my journal also confirms that throughout time I have consistently wanted to quit.

For a year now I have wanted to quit but was not successful... why cant I do this? Other respects of my life are in order, I'm fit, eat well, meditate occasionally, code and read in my spare time (when I'm not baked)... my point is I have alot of stuff people would consider self disciplined. However, when it comes to smoking weed I just cant do it... it's my conclusion to the day I love coming home and smoking a joint while cooking for example...

I want to quit now for good. The painful thing is I've read and understand how to quit... I just cant seem to stick to it... and feel really hopeless, sad, lonely, low self esteem and the like... I guess I'm looking for support not direction you know...

If anyone is interested here are my note i foundback in April with the two entries unedited (yes, I like to write in 3rd person sometimes lol):

We are quitting weed [09/04/19]

 -We want to quit and we will.
-Smoking weed comes from being bored...
-Smoking comes knocking at the door when you want to relax...
-Smoking comes knocking when you want to conclude the day...

WHY I WANT TO QW
- EMOTIONAL STABILITY

- More time and energy
- Pride of overcoming it
- Be true to your purpose
- Not dependent on anything
- Clear Headed

- WH breathing in the morning will be alot easier
- OMG Running is harder. KNOW: breathing is shittttt while running, that feeling of clear lungs is so much betterI
- I'll be more productive
- Weed makes you stupid
- A girlfriend that stays

Why I DONT want to quit
- I enjoy having a little smoke in the evening to conclude the day
- ‘Signs me out’ mentally 
- Its a form of escapism from the world; somewhere where I can retreat 
- Less mind chatter; checks me out of this world..
- I sleep like a baby

Plan1.0 [09/04]
So i think going cold turkey will be very hard. So our initial plan is to only smoke weed every other day... Monday ON, Tuesday OFF, Wednesday ON, Thursday OFF, Friday OFF Saturday ON, Sunday OFF... ect ... lets see how this goes. we wil do this for 2 weeks. Also from now on, we tell people we have quit and we dont smoke with anyone.

Plan 2 [11/06/19]
Plan 1 has not worked and in fact we are smoking more than ever,  including during the day... New Plan is to ONLY SMOKE DURING THE EVENINGS. NO MORE SMOKING DURING THE DAY EXCEPT WEEKENDS. This do this for 2 weeks then try and inact plan 1 again.

i meant to post when it was officially 2 1/2 years today, but that’s ok. i did it!! i’ve gotten so far in this journey. farther than i ever have before. 

for the first time today i thought to myself that if i smoked weed again it would make me deeply unhappy. i didnt romanticize it. i honestly believe that if i hit a joint and relapsed today or any time in the future that i would regret it and being high would ruin the satisfaction i’ve accumulated in my life. 

but obviously not every day i am so certain of this. i’m in college so i’m around stoners and friends who smoke weed every now and then and sometimes my sobriety feels rocky, but i always recover. but i’m happy that on my day of 2 1/2 years i am certain in my long decision to stay completely sober. 

also i made the dean’s list at my difficult ass college this week and that felt amazing! probably never could have happened if i was still smoking weed. look how far we’ve come! 

anyway, i’m happy to chat about my strategies and sobriety to anyone who needs it so feel free to reach out!",2

Here we go again...,"Wasn't able to quit on my own without being a danger to myself and others, so I lied and said I was alcoholic so they'd let me in to rehab for 90 days. 

Don't wanna go on a long story right now but it worked. Took advantage of every resource they gave me. 2019 was a rough year but also one of the best years of my life cause I finally took control of my own life.  

Relapsed in November and couldnt stop. My intuition told me to do a water fast and it worked. Haven't smoked in over a week. Psych withdrawals fuckin with me a lot though.  

Not a big fan of the suicidal, self-hate thoughts. The fatalistic thoughts. The resurgence of past trauma. I really hate how my brain goes through the past and thinks about fucked up stuff to be angry about. Sometimes can't tell if it's righteous anger or just the monkey brain looking for stimulation.  

Either way I'm just riding through it. I know it'll eventually pass. I'm just concerned about my safety.   

Been hitting the gym and eating healthy. A bit scared to meditate on my own because last time all these violent thoughts took over and I had a freakout.   

Wish I could be around other people more often. Nothing like socializing to get myself out of my head. Extreme loneliness also hitting me hard as I haven't had a girlfriend since 2011 and I'm still traumatized from the breakup. Most of the sex partners I've had last 5 years, I've either had to pay, or were girls I didn't like that much.  

Either way, I hope to get through this cloud and start doing the things that make me happy and connect me to other people.",5

I just wanted to get some feelings off my chest that I don't always see described, maybe someone else can relate and we can feel less alone in this.

The day feels like literally a 20-hour argument with myself in my head, about EVERYTHING.  Like every negative thought that I could have, I'm having, and I have to keep swatting them away before they take control of me.  I have a real rational sense that these thoughts are complete bullshit, but the pain and difficulty they cause me are like they are real regardless.  

Including but not limited to:

\-all your friends have perfect successful lives and you're a worthless unemployed drug addict living in your parents house

\-i'll never be myself again because of this, even if i quit

\-a very hard to describe nonsensical feeling that I'm experiencing a special level of mental pain that no one understands (which of course complete and utter bullshit, but despite knowing this, I still FEEL it).  and this makes me feel like extra isolated.

\-life is pointless bullshit and weed makes you not care, better to be high, happy and careless than constantly drudging through the motions of typical sober life

\-pure exhaustion and palpable anxiety about the thought of having to battle like this the rest of my life...and that I might be so addicted that I'm going to have to.

\-feeling stuck in limbo- guilty, depressed, ashamed about many things in my past...while simultaneously being so terrified of the future- that I just feel totally trapped

And at the end of the day, despite being so mentally exhausted, my head hits the pillow and its like the internal battle in my head is even worse, because now I don't have anything to distract me like work or exercise or games or friends- its just me.  And if I don't find a way to win this battle fast in these moments, I get no sleep.  And so it becomes this horrible cycle of the fear of getting no sleep makes sleeping harder.  Terrible.

I'd say fear is the predominating emotion.  I'm afraid that I can't do this.  I'm afraid I'll become one of those people who wasted their life, that it passed them by.

I've only been struggling with this for about 7-8 months, most of which was high every day, with stretches of days, a week or two here and there from quit attempts.  But holy shit it still feels like so long, I almost forget what its like to be me.  So much was different about me before I found this stupid drug.  It's like I just forgot everything about what I wanted, where I was going.  And now it's REALLY hard to pick up the pieces and try to find that stuff again- the things that made me actually want to wake up in the morning.

I toked at 14 to cope with the abuse and the bullying. I was close to jump from a high building around that time. Just sat there looking down on the world that hated me so much. Smoked the first joint a few days after and found something that made my life simple. I could take the beatings and the horrible shit that was on the daily.

I found a way to survive, as long as i had weed i could manage. So life became about gathering for tomorrow and escape for today.

Somewhere around in my twenties i got jacked and hold at gun point at a time i was very high. I have never felt that afraid and the high just vaporized and stood clearheaded in panic. 

Few months after i started hearing voices.  Thoughts that was not mine, commands that i did not think. I quit cold turkey and spend 2 months isolated from ""friends"". Was very hard and horrible to go thru. 

8 months after i got clean more or less i had life under control.. Well more than i had in may years. Started a education, talked to a nice girl. Got away from my abusive mother and thought life was about to change.

It did. My spine had some kinda ticking time bomb illness so out of nothing i found myself with chronic pain.  I could not cope with the reality that i had fought that hard and went thru such withdrawals and horrible memories of the person i had become thru the weed and hate towards the world.

I lost my education chance, the girl was nothing i had thought and ended alone in apartment with no other than my abusive mother to help me.

I was never taught how to be out in the real world as my mom kept on fucking with my head thru narcissistic games, perversions and guilt to keep my head locked in some weird shit. Told me such horrible tales and lies and started fucking with every last piece of what i had left out in the real world.

Found myself in such a hole i could no longer take life. Could not sleep, could not maintain. So i toked..Just once. And just like that i got pulled in the escape again. I lost my mind and my will to live. I just wanted to die. 

So i took a chance and tried to kill myself. Got locked in an asylum and stuffed with various drugs that ended up frying my brain in such a way i haven't felt myself ever since. Went in and out of this horrible place a few times until i had enough.

Everything in my life was shit. I was around 200kg. Fat, fried and fucked.

Took up the fight and started loosing weight. Lost over 100 kg. Was winning again. Was gaining myself again.  Then my back got worse and all the shit was crawling thru the walls and i fell in the weed big time again.

Government fucked me over and let me rot on welfare as they did not want to help me so i just kept on sinking in the depression. Weed started to become the only reason to get up. The only reason to exist. As i just wanted to die. Years went by that way. Just stoned every day all day. I wanted to die.

So i got up again and fought my way out of the shit again. Quit the weed. Found my life spark again aaaand.. Just like that i got hit with nerve infection that caused me to feel pain i had no idea existed.

They put me on so high doses of morphine i fried my head even worse. I wanted to die again. I started toking mad again and just hazed thru the day. 

So few weeks ago i reached 40. Meaning i have been sick close to 18 years now. With nothing to show for it. I want to die. To get away from this shit..These few people that does nothing but get me drugs and keep me down.

Few weeks ago i finally find a connection with somebody and i start to feel again.  But i am a mess and i yet again must realize i do not fit anywhere in this world as i have been locked in this apartment for nearly half my life. World goes on..Very fast. She could not return the feelings i had.

I feel every time i toke i get paranoid now. Get these weird reality perspectives that i cant seem to place anywhere. I cant seem to find myself anymore.. What is real..what is paranoia.. What is anything anymore.

So i started to cut down on weed. And again every toke is causing my mind to fly right off in bad paranoia and feeling people are going to hurt me.. Did that car follow me.. 

I tried cold turkey but smoking that much for that long is causing withdrawals and pain to get worse so what ever i choose its fucking horrible.

I cut down over the last few weeks and i am 4 days sober today. I cant sleep. Pain is horrible.

Depression is hard atm and all these things i have been thru and mind games and sexual advanced from my mother is really messing up my head.

I cant take this shit no more. I just want this to end. 

What the fuck shall i do?. I am so far away from reality and myself

It is like every time i get close to something good my life just takes a turn for the worse.

Sorry for the text wall and thanks to whom ever reads this.

So the only remaining symptom is the night sweats really. 

Again, i expect these to subside over this week. I initially thought that they would last two weeks. But it seems; for me at least they're going to linger into week three. 

I managed to get my first weight lifting session in today. It really makes you feel amazing doesn't it, exercise i mean. 

I got really emotional during my workout, a song I was listening to actually brought me  (a grown up man) to tears, heh. 

It felt bitter sweet. Marijuana really dulls ones emotions, i think I was releasing built up emotion. I was mostly thinking about my ex girlfriend while crying. 

I felt amazing after letting it all out. By the way, I work out alone in my garage incase you're wondering. I wasn't crying my eyes out in a public gym, while everyone looked on in disbelief 😁. 

Peace and love to all of you out there ✌

2020-02-20 15:36:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f6za8n/1_year_clean_still_have_withdrawals_post_acute/,"1 year clean, still have withdrawals (post acute withdrawal)","Wow, so one year ago I quit smoking weed. Its been a really shit, terrible year and Ive suffered a lot but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now.  Ive been going through post acute withdrawal, which I think people on here are probably familiar with.  I posted this on another sub, which is a sub just for post acute withdrawal from weed.  Just thought id post it here to share; in case others are suffering like I have been.

I used to smoke a lot. For 5 years - the first 2 years just a small bowl every night; then increased that a lot the next two years; I smoked a few bowls a day. By the end of that I was smoking 1-3 grams a day. There was a time I quit once; and I felt mild paws symptoms - headache, insomnia, depression, anxiety; but all very mild. Then I started smoking dab pens and concentrates for a year or two - thats when the health symptoms I observed went off the chain. They were things like: headache, muscle aches, poor sleep (had to smoke multiple times a night to sleep), erectile dysfunction, depression, constantly tired.

Because of those symptoms I decided to quit weed; these things had no explanation and so eventually I thought they must be from weed. I had planned on quitting for a couple months (thinking Id be over withdrawal by then) and then just smoking smoking on occasion - but boy I didnt know just what hell I would unleash on myself when I quit. I didnt realize how much my body had become accustomed to weed and how much my body physically needed it. Quitting wasnt mentally hard - I never had a problem not smoking and so I still struggle to say I was addicted - but boy, my body was physically addicted.

I soon learned that those strange symptoms I observed when smoking were all PAWS symptoms - all mild paws symptoms. When I quit, wow. Ive never gone through any health issue this long and arduous. And all these symptoms were a lot worse after using oils and dab pens. Holy hell, fuck those pens.

**headache** \- The headache was very, very intense and I struggled to even keep my eyes open. It was constant, while awake and while asleep. It was all over my head; felt like my head was inside multiple clamps just clamping it shut. It has decreased slowly over the year; and now at one year it is very mild and I dont notice it some days.

**Insomnia** \- The first two months, I probably averaged 2-3 hrs of sleep a night. It was miserable. Now, I get 7 (which is still not enough for me) and sometimes I sleep very poorly. But being exhausted for almost a year was just as bad as having a headache. My sleep is still not perfect; but it is getting better - currently it is better sleep than Id get when I smoked weed.

**Brain fog** \- Thinking was hard. Thinking hurt; I woke up every day regretting that I woke up because if this. Working was hard. All my brain wanted to do was sleep; even though I couldnt because of insomnia. My brain just couldnt function. Even talking was hard. This lasted a good 4-6 months; then got better over the next 3. At this point, I dont feel this anymore; my brain just feels a more normal ""tired"" if I dont sleep well.

**Vivid/scary Dreams** \- When smoking, you doont dream. When I stopped, I started dreaming after a couple weeks clean; and boy the dreams were scary. SOme were exciting, but mostly they were very violent, scary, and delt with my deepest worries. It was terrible. These got better and better over 6 months; and now I occasionally get a scary dream but its very infrequent and probably not even caused by PAWS.

**Erectile Dysfunction / Low libido** \- This was the main reason I quit. I had mild-moderate (intermittent) ED when I was smoking. When I quit, my sex drive dropped to 0. Nothing would turn me on; nothing interested me sexually. I had no interest in sex, porn etc. It was like that whole part of my body was just turned off. It stayed like that for 7 months; then improved slightly (still had ED); and now at a year I feel it improving slightly more. I hope to be cured of this soon...it is the most frustrating part of this whole ordeal without a doubt as it directly affects any significant other in your life. Nowadays I sometimes get morning wood - which I used to get every day. Thats a decent indicator of the ED status. But I still dont get it 100% of the time, and when I do its not very hard.

**Depression** \- Depression didnt hit me as hard as it hits others. But it didn hit me pretty bad for a few months; about 6. Havent had severe depression since then; just me being my normal depressed self.

**Anxiety** \- I didnt get a lot of anxiety; mild-moderate every now and then during the first 6 months. Id feel a heavy pressure in my chest.

**Pain around eyes** \- This has been there the entire time and even before when I was smoking. It is only mildly painful but really makes me want to just close my eyes and sleep. I still get this symptom at 1 year.

**Sore muscles** \- I wake up with achy muscles; its like my body just did not do the repair work on my muscles that is supposed to be done when you sleep. Mostly my fingers and toes; or if I use any other muscle during the day I feel it. If I worked out, then whatever muscle I worked out would be sore as hell for a few days. It made exercising miserable. This has only recently gotten better, and now at 1 year it is very mild.

**Swollen Lymph nodes** \- This wasnt particularly painful; but just really annoying. And it lasted a long. This last week is the first time my lymph nodes actually feel normal - at one year!

**Tinnitus** \- I got tinnitus two or three times; lasting 2-3 days each time. Usually in one ear; low pitch buzzing.

Im doing a lot better now than I was even 3 months ago - and hoping that this next few months will be even better.  I have waves of these symptoms now, whereas before they were constant and more intense.  At least I have some good days now and hopefully the next few months my brain will be healed.

Now granted, if one day you “fail” and decide to take a warm shower, it doesn’t mean you have to go out and relapse.

Ive been on the BHO train for a little while now, and the convenience of smoking wax makes it way too easy to spark up literally any time I have the inkling. I'm currently working from home, so that leaves any and everyday open for smoking.

I had been telling myself I would take a break and quit for a while and then I realized that that is not the way that I want to do it. I started smoking for a reason (my health), and the only thing making pot a bad thing right now is myself and how Im letting it impact my life. I realized that telling myself to quit, but not actually wanting to, having solid reasons why, and not making it into a positive thing in my mind basically made it impossible to quit.

Whenever youre battling with anything, most of the time the right maneuver is a flank. You sneak up on yourself, and use tactics to get yourself to quit. Give yourself something to do that you enjoy, that you wouldn't be able to do high. Spend more time with people (WHO DON'T SMOKE) and see how that affects your habit. Might not affect it much, then regroup and try another tactic. If it does, then dope. You've figured something out about yourself.

Anyways, if you want to quit, don't fight yourself head on. You're probably too set in your ways  to let yourself change that easily. Work with yourself, outwit yourself and FLANK.

After magic mushrooms, **I HATE SMOKING WEED** it ruined the feeling and no matter how much I've smoked/vaped after Psilocybin it feels like I'm poisoning myself because of the fog. Drugs are only anything fun when you have the self-discipline to do them rarely ironically. Once you get tolerance and withdrawal symptoms to kick in, you enter the very bottom of hell. Then again, this goes for any activity, as anything can become an addiction because once you do something enough that it becomes boring, you have a tolerance to that activity and without adding in variety, you're essentially addicted to something that no longer serves you.",3

Blowing my paychecks to feel better, but eventually running out and being depressed about it. I've read posts here daily and can definitely relate to almost every one. I have officially smoked the last of my resin. And pay day is tomorrow. I want to kick this habit and feel normal again. I'm sick of being broke every time I get paid just to push my ""feel good button""
I've watched our finances go to shit while I barracade myself in and shut others out. 
I've lost good friends and have hung out in some pretty shitty environments just to get that fix. I don't feel like the person I was meant to be, nor the dad I wanted to be with this looming over my head and my heart. 
I tell myself that ""it's a reward"" every time I complete some miniscule task. 
Every morning I wake up its my boost for the day, I tell myself work would suck without it. When I clean the house it's what I get when I finished. 
How do I get rid of a habit that's been my  reward system for almost 20 years?

Don't get me wrong, I love my brother, he looked me up with free highs up until he moved out this December. Wed smoke almost everyday, we'd drop acid and 2cb on the occasion, we even tried DMT. During this experience I was going through a lot of depression and was using weed as a coping method on a nightly basis. I'd come home and black out every fucking day. What made me want to quit were my XC and track teammates, I opened up to them and they were very dissapointed in me. They all saw me different, they saw me as a druggie. These are my best friends, it hurt. So this last week when we were on our way to States for track, I took that trip as a time to begin my sobriety. I threw everything I had left out the night before and we went on our way. Now looking back after a week of being sober, im very proud of myself. This is the longest I've went without weed in two years and I feel great. I have no urges, withdrawals are beginning to fade, and I feel like a better person.

I started smoking daily around 2014 & I delved into pills when I stopped getting high from just weed. I think my anxiety issues would have came to light with or without pills but they definetly sped up and/or made it 1000x worse then it would be if I didn’t. I havent smoked or done any substance in around a month (26 days to be exact) and I have tried to handle this anxiety in every natural way I could think of.. but it just gets worse. Its at a point where im looking for a job & my anxiety is so bad I cant even get out of my room to do anything & im left sitting here hating myself for keeping myself in this position. Not only does it affect my job search but is also affecting my social life. I have friends that invite me to go out with them to bars & all that type of stuff a guy my age should be out doing & everytime I get so stressed & worked up over nothing & I end up staying inside for the night dreading myself watchhing my friends live it up at the clubs. I know quitting weed is gonna give me extra anxiety/panic attacks but at this point I feel like I fucked up something in my brain that needs to be treated proffesionally. Ive dealt with anxiety in the past & its honestly always been a issue since like 2013. I just wanna feel normal & do normal things again. 


But one brightside is I have really grown out of weed. I have tried quitting many times since around 2016 & each time I have never felt like I just didn’t want to do it anymore cause I loved it. But I don’t love it anymore, I truly don’t want it anymore at all. Its not something I ever want in my life again actually.

I don't advocate against cannabis because i know deep down, it helped me with my depression, in fact, it was under the influence that i hit multiple epiphanies, how no matter how rough life is, when i hit rock bottom, everything would be okay as long as i keep looking forward, and that i could still enjoy life no matter what. But not only did it erase (or suppressed ) that sorrowful side of me, it also started to erase my principles, my values.  

Long story short, dark and vicious thoughts grew in me, i didn't care about anything anymore. I kept spending my parents money and dropping classes non-stop. Now thinking in retrospect, i didn't even bother trying to study for the final, i dropped cuz i felt like it, because i had enough allowance to last forever. It was as if i became the embodiment of the 7 deadly sins, I became gluttonous, lazy, vengeful, manipulative,... every wrong action i took, came with some sort of conviction/excuse that it was okay. I would smoke day and night but my dosage would remain constant, for sake of not turning into an addict. I never questioned myself no matter what happened, as long as i had weed, i was invincible. The turning point for me was 2 summers ago, when i tried a no fap challenge, for some reason i suddenly stopped smoking weed as well and finally, came the waterfall of guilt. I drowned in regret and saw the trail self-destruction i've paved for myself. From that moment on, i decided that i needed to reconsider my life decisions. Quiting was a hard challenge i ever face, i was in denial at first, then finally accepted that i was craving for weed. I tried my best to slow down, decreasing dosage little by little. 

 It  took me 12 month+ to stop completely, i had sever insomnia, existential crisis, withdraw symptoms. The hardest part was being with friends that smoke a lot, it took a lot of willpower to refuse a joint, refuse a joint offered over and over again. I couldn't bring myself to distance myself from them because when i was at the lowest point of my life, they were there for me. As time passes, i realized they were suffering from weed as well, i tried my best to help them but it was futile, everyone was drowning in their own delusions and convictions. Maybe it's just me, maybe weed wasn't the problem this whole time, it was just my own selfish nature that caused all this pain, i question it even to this day.

Fastforward to present day, I stopped completely and haven't smoked since december 27th, about 50 days sober. My friends still offer me weed and i politely tell them that i'm stopping for 1 year for a challenge. The idea of smoking weed pops in my mind every few nights, i even dreamt of myself smoking with my friends. I have no more insomnia, more emotionally stable, better memory, less brain fog. I am happy to say a relapse in weed wont happen anytime soon. Im glad i found this subreddit because i was the only one amongst my stoner friends that wanted to quit. I wish the best to you guys.

So I've made it to day 31 and I wanted to talk about sleep! I love my sleep and I love a lie in when I can get one- but the one big change I have noticed since quitting weed is how ridiculous dreams have become since. These are the main things I have noticed since quitting:

\- Dreams are extremely vivid, and crazy random! In the early days of quitting they were nightmarish, with very real demons (maybe my own?!) mixing with in with scenarios involving friends and acquaintances. There was one scenario where I had to escape my house just to get away from the demons, only for my boss (who I get on with really well) just grab me and throw me back inside, all whilst laughing!

\- Sleep Paralysis- Has anyone else experienced this after quitting? It's usually just after dropping off, my eyes will open, I am kinda dreaming, but can not move a muscle, and then sheer panic sets in. I often find my head shouting my girls name, who is right next to me, to help me, but I cannot move my lips. It lasts a minute or a couple at most (last time I was saying her name over and over in my head, eventually I was saying it aloud over and over and she pulled me out of it). All I can describe it as is sheer terror. 

\- Using dreams- as I've got further into my journey without weed, I have had a few dreams now, especially over the last 10 days, where I have used, I've rolled up and blasted away without a care in the world, or hit the pipe with no fucks given. I know myself I haven't used but it hasn't stopped me from feeling guilty when I've woke up! This could be down to in the last week there have been thoughts that have crept in where I've thought about the positives of smoking, and thought will there be any harm in just lighting up once and having a good few hours of gaming whilst high? But then I know to stay strong as one joint will be too many, 10 wouldn't be enough.

\- Repeating dreams- So I'm having not the nicest of dreams, wake up sweaty, grab a drink or nip to the bathroom or whatever and then when I put my head back on the pillow- BAM I'm right in the same dream where I left off.

Has anyone else experienced similar things?! Is this normal?

Very eager to hear any stories if so! Thank you all for your support",1

Actually 299 days today, but tomorrow marks 300 days. In one week I have gone 10 months 100% weed-free.

This is after almost 20 years of daily smoking, except for a one year break around 10 years ago.Started smoking some at 16, but somewhere around 18-19 it became daily. Im 38 in a few weeks.

Im also now on day 117 without cigarettes after 25 years of daily smoking and consitently working out 5 days a week for the last 3 months. Life and health is improving every day!

&#x200B;

Its been a while since i posted here, and this is yet another long post, but not a rant like the ones i wrote last year under this username. Reading those posts is very strange for me now that im where im at now. It feels like it was in another life :)

I started my journey in April last year and had a really shitty 2019 to be honest.

I have struggled with anxiety, low self-esteem and obsessive thoughs for several years and felt most of my days was in a ""haze"" where i just worked, smoked, ate, watched tv, anxious, smoked, slept - repeat.. I was thinking about quitting for a long time, thought about it for years, but it wasnt until a day i got a major panic attack i said to myself this is my last day of smoking. That was April 27 2019.

After quitting I was in hell for several months. I was on sick-leave for a few months, and had problems even driving an the car and going to the store due to anxiety dizziness and vision issues.

Also struggled with DP/DR and had a trip to the ER after a major panic attack that i thought was a stroke. I was in fetal position after this for a few days afterwards, and also struggled with sleep for a long time and had to take some subscription meds for this.

I slowly got back to working over a few months after, and tapering off sleeping meds, but still struggled alot with anxiety.

Felt like I had to re-learn everything.. going to the store, meeting friends, family members, collegues, customers, everything was a huge challenge, and i was sweating, felt like i was about to loose consciousness in customer meetings etc for a long time.

I do still have some anxiety but its manageable and gets better every week, slowly.

Since I have been smoking for so long i dont really know what the ""normal me"" is, so I had to get to know the sober me aswell and I actually like him better than the stoned me :).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Things that got me trough this shit:

\* Be prepared for a while where you feel like crap. How long time you will feel like crap varies alot. For me i felt really crap for 4+ months and then got better, then worse again and around 6 months was when i really started to see more consistent improvements. Know that you WILL get better but it will take some time, often a long time.

&#x200B;

\* Meta-Cognitive-Therapy: I went to a really good pscyhologist who specialized in meta-cognitive therapy. This is basically the learning on how to not give a f\* and dont trust everything your brain throws at you. It says alot of things you really dont need to pay attention to. It sounds really easy buts actually very hard, but with a good therapist and a lot of self-work.

&#x200B;

\* Do more of the stuff that makes you happy:  For me its the small things. Going out fishing, hiking in the woods, having a beer in the sun.

&#x200B;

\* Working less: I have worked my ass off for many years at work, working long days, nights, weekends for no other reason than earning more money then I need. I cut down on my expenses and now take one day off every other week, where i do whatever i want. Basically told my boss this is how its going to be or i will have to find something else to do.  They let me take (unpaid) days of whenever i want to. These days off are sually spent walking around in the city, sitting at a bench watching people, fishing etc, doing stuff with family etc.

&#x200B;

\* Sleeping: This is key. Get enough sleep. I go to bed earlier and wind down with a good book before sleeping.

&#x200B;

\* Meditation: Every night i meditate for 15-30 minutes, usually using guided meditations on Headspace (App)

&#x200B;

\* Diet: Since my SO is a vegetarian this was easy, but cutting down on meat and adding alot more fish, sallad, whole foods makes atleast my body work alot better.

&#x200B;

\* Working out: Currently been working out for 5 days a week the last 3 months, prior to that I had to walk atleast an hour 6-7 days a week in the woods to keep the anxiety in check, now im doing heavy weight training and have seen huge mood improvements and lower anxiety after taking up this. It also helps with sleep.

\* Massage: Going to 1-2 hour massage sessions every few weeks also helps alot in calming down mind and body.

\* Get help and support from /r/leaves : This subreddit and reading other peoples post really helped alot in keeping  me away from weed during the worst months, where the devil on the shoulder kept saying ""just one hit and this pain will be over..""..

&#x200B;

This post got alot longer then i planned, hope it can help someone like this awesome subreddit did! I wish all of you the best of luck in your quitting!! :)",78

I've been smoking pretty much daily since 2011.  I'm getting older. I want to have kids. I want to grow my career. I want to invest my money in something else. But I'm struggling to stay sober. I  went 3 months before I got married and I took two weeks off around the holidays this year, but I was in a different country so it was easy.

When I'm home, it's so easy for me to find legal weed, to take a quick rip and be about my day. it calms me. It's habitual and my wife says I'm kinder when stoned. But I want to be clean for my health, for my kids health, and for my own personal growth. I just can't seem to stop myself from finding excuses, slipping, or bargaining with myself. Whenever I slow down, It goes from infrequent to once a day, and quickly snowballs into multi-daily use and before work smoking.  Can you guys give me any advice for what you've done in the past to escape from your own habits?  Been saying I was gonna quit for almost a year and nothing sticks. Trouble sleeping and exercising without it. Just feel stuck in a rut.

It’s been a few weeks now didn’t really keep track like I did last time which has made it easier in some ways. 

Tho I never hit any “bottoms” or even came close to losing my job, I always excelled. This allowed me to continue getting high frequently as it became the new normal and a big part of my life. I realize now that’s mostly because my job is very monotonous and just not anything I want to be doing with my life (I work in Insurance). I try to take what I do seriously but it’s really just draining my soul out through my eyes (3 monitors ...ugh) 

I’m not exactly sure how to pivot into a more enjoyable path, and I currently make decent money considering where I am, how old I am and what I went to school for (telecommunications production...).

At first it was great, but slowly it allowed me to lose track of things in life and fall behind in my trajectory. I lost a girlfriend from being high and paranoid all the time. My anxiety and depression got worse as I would fixate over things in my head whenever I am high, lets also not forget mini-panic attacks I got from smoking too much. My college life has also been hurt by weed, as since I was high all the time, I did not put in the time to make many friends, join any clubs, and the social paranoia and awkwardness from marijuana would just make it worse even if I tried. Weed changed me, it made me way more introverted and weary of people, I stop being funny, happy, or charismatic on it. My only thought when I speak to people when I am high is that they probably hate me. My grades also suffered, as after a breakup, I spiraled into smoking and basically being a shell of a human. I started being high all-day, which prevented me from doing work and falling behind in my engineering degree. So now, though I do have a few people I am close, I have bad grades, no SO, and barely any friends, but I do not want to give up. I want to quit weed and actively try to change my life.

And once the school quarter started up, I was getting high everyday and occassionally also drunk. Also, I’m trying to stay away from porn (you don’t wanna hear the details) and caffeine. I’m even very sensitive to caffeine and it fucks up my mind for like half the day, but I regularly only get 4 hrs of sleep a night due to late work and early school, so that cycle is vicious af.

BUT, yesterday, I got stoned (after finishing homework and such), and that was it. I didn’t have any booze and didn’t view any porn, and only had a small amount of caffeine, so I guess that’s an improvement from constantly doing all 4.

Also, I was hoping keeping up with school would be enough pressure for me to quit, but I’m still doing extremely well in spite of being stoned all the time, which is weird.

There was a point in my life when I just didn’t even get dressed some days.

I would lay around in my underwear and play golf games and pro evolution soccer on PlayStation, roll joints and get stoned all day long at weekends.

I remember a Sunday evening of February back in 2003. As was the way back then, I had been partying from the night before and it got so messy. I didn’t get much sleep if any.

The police were at the door because a boyfriend of one of my housemates smashed the window in the front door because he was angry, as you do?!?

There I was, standing there and the neighbours were looking in at me in my dressing gown doing my best impersonation of Hugh Heffner.

The embarrassment I felt as I opened the door to let the police in to ask us questions about the shenanigans from last night.

I knew I had to get my life sorted out because I was going nowhere, really fast.

My life consisted of going to the job I hated, counting the time down to get home until I could get stoned because I literally couldn’t stand to feel the feelings of shame that I had for my empty life.

I was going from one meaningless relationship to the next meaningless relationship, hurting people along the way in order to satisfy my need to check out of my uncomfortable emotions by using these women.

I was a mess and wasn’t proud!

This was the time when I knew that I had to do something but I had no idea where to turn.

I wanted to give up being so dependent on being high all the time, I felt so guilty about that and couldn’t respect myself and look into my own eyes👁.

I wasn’t proud of who I had become!

I remember the first day I went to therapy, I remember the drive there, I remember being defensive and then I remember giving up that game, being direct and open about what was happening and the floodgates opened and I released a barrage of tears.

I couldn’t stop for literally 5 minutes.

That deep uncontrollable breathing kind of crying. Literally wailing like a little child.

It had been years since I allowed myself to release emotions and feel them deeply.

I had thrown away the key to that emotional lock and that inner part of me had opened the lock from the inside.

It felt so good.

I grew to really love those visits to my therapist.

The sea breeze as I left after each session welcomed me and the time I took to walk on the beach and reflect on what had come up were some of the most valuable moments of my life.

I remember in one session, I forgave a part of myself for deciding to take drugs to numb my pain and really getting over the guilt and shame I felt for ‘being a junkie’, a label I became really self-identified with.

When I reframed that part of my history, it allowed me to see myself in a new light.

I view that work of healing my trauma as the vital foundational building blocks for who I have subsequently become.

In no way could I hold space now for my clients if I had never dealt with my own crap and this is the point.

We can’t conceive of who we can potentially be when we feel and conceptualise ourselves in a dark and narrow way.

I wasn't aware I was defining myself that way.

The emotional reality of those self-identifications doesn’t allow us to see ourselves in a bright, shiny and awesome future.

The potential is there but we have to clear the mess after the party that’s gotten out of hand first.

I never want to get out of bed. I almost skipped class. I’m always so tired. I’m so lonely. All of my friends are still heavy pot heads so I don’t have anyone to do much with. When I was smoking I was in a good routine of getting up and going to class/work and cleaning house every night and such. Sure I was in a fog but that fog made me be able to live. Now all I can feel again is my depression in full force. I go to therapy but I’m still just in a funk. When I started smoking again I ruined my GPA. so that is really weighing me down. I have no clue what I want to major in the slightest. I feel so pointless and have not much hope. It makes me want to get high again. Ugh. I know I need to snap out of it I just am so lost and hopeless. I have unprocessed grief from losing a parent as a child and that just keeps overcoming me every time I stop smoking. Smoking put me in a really bad place. But my sober mind isn’t much of a better place. I’m soon to be 21 and I enjoy drinking occasionally but alcoholism is heavy in my family so that scares me. I feel like when I’m not smoking I don’t have those craves for drinking like I do when I’m in the weed haze. I feel like I had a pink cloud for 3 days and then the damn dark depression cloud in me swallowed that shit right up. Lol.,7

2020-02-19 11:53:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f6dhvj/weed_addiction/,Weed addiction !!!!),"I feel like I’ve smoked weed to the point where I don’t even know who I am anymore, lost without a purpose. You know? Life just feels so meaningless and I feel so insignificant. I used to be so confident, bubbly, spontaneous, fun but now I feel so anxious and safest when I’m alone at home, either sleeping or smoking weed, or both. 

Staying sober feels like a lifetime whereas when I’m high, time passes by in an instant. And when I think about it, I don’t even know how much time has passed that I’ve been doing this for, I can’t remember. Being in such a state all the time makes me distant from everyone because I don’t want anyone to see me the way I am, it’s not pretty. 

I really do want to try to quit, and I have, kinda. But it’s so fucking hard when I get so easily pulled back into it. To resist the urge. Like earlier today I was on the phone to my best friend (who is overseas atm) and after the phone call, I felt really good, but then I smoked a joint? You know? Psychologically and physically, I’m consumed by it. I keep telling myself “the next day I’m actually going to to try! I’m actually going to quit because it’s what’s best for me!” ...  but it never happens. Like I do know it’s what would be best for me but a matter of actually doing it, it’s so difficult. 

A part of me just feels so unmotivated and out of energy constantly to even do anything. Everything feels pointless. I really do want to start enjoying life again and I know what I have to do to get on my way there but it feels like I’m so far away from it, too far gone I guess?

My immune system has fallen down too. It’s weak. I’ve gotten sick a fair few times and I guess I also use that as a reason to justify myself doing nothing or sleeping at home. To make myself feel better about it. My appetite too, I don’t eat much nowadays. And he’ll, like even rn I’m hungry!! But it’s like I don’t want to eat, like I’m too lazy to go and nourish my body in some food (which is what it needs) and I use the smoking so I don’t have to eat. And when I do eat, I become even hungrier, but I’m not fulfilling my body’s needs because I can’t be bothered, so I try to sleep it off. 

Feeling shit physically and mentally is just horrible. 

But I remember this quote “you can’t complain about being in hell when you chose to put yourself there”

And I guess it’s right because I AM choosing this. But with dependency in motion, it makes things 10x harder. There’s a part inside me that REALLY wants to get back on track but I’m trapped. It’s like my mind and body are just craving weed. 

But I guess coming here is a step in a more right direction right?",16

Well where do I start? I’m 36 years old and have been smoking weed regularly since I was 15. I have quit in the past around three times with the longest time being a year. I also have a history of abusing harder drugs but have been sober for over four years and I only drink socially here and there. I should also throw in I’ve struggled with anxious and depressive tendencies since childhood. In March of last year I was Baker Acted at the hospital for a week where I was for forced to stop smoking cold turkey and it was unbearable to say the least. I stayed sober for three months after that. During that time the insomnia and anxiety started to get a little better but I was miserable and irritable 24/7. My wife begged me to start smoking again after begging me to stop before. Pot is always good to me in the first few months. I’m happier overall and I sleep better but after a while it tends to mess with my sleep and bring out the anxiety in me. I’ve been slowly tapering down the amount I smoke at night since October and have  since reached an amount I cannot seem to stick with. It’s just not enough to put me to sleep. I know I have to just let it go but the withdrawal terrifies me. Crazy to think that quitting something that gives you anxiety and insomnia will only make those same issues worse. I think my biggest hurdle over all is sticking it out past a year to give my brain the proper time to heal... Any tips for quitting cold turkey??",1

This is the third time I've tried to stop in the last year (I'm the guy who smokes at least 4 times a day), one time I was there a little more than a week and I was totally desperate, second time I was there for 3 weeks and I really don't know why I started smoking again, it was like I was expecting to feel different, better, and I was, but not as I wanted, the only difference was that I was performing better at work but, to be honest, I was already performing really nice, so that didn't matter. I felt sick for the first 4 or 5 days but that was somehow a reason to keep going.

Now I don't really know why I'm stopping, it just happened and I guess I just need to stop. Anyway I don't feel like anything has changed ... I'll stick to not smoking just to be healthier but I really want to feel that 'mind clearness' every body talks about, I want to feel like my lungs are performing better when I work out, I want to feel like I am doing more things with my free time since I am not wasting my time smoking ... But I just feel everything it's the same, except for (against the odds) I am sleeping way too much.",2

I commented on that post but decided to share my response here as well in hopes that it can help others with similar concerns. 

Hello, day 12 here, (holy crap I've made it to day 12!) And I'm sharing a bit of that same fear. How much time must pass before it feels ""normal?"" Especially when you see posts of ppl feeling stuck, or struggling after months of not smoking. I've smoked daily for years and years so day 12 is unbelievable for me, every day is a new record for me! But yes those fears still linger.

 I'm in an educational (CBT cognitive behavioural therapy) group right now that talks about addiction, and emotional maturity. Apparently with weed, it stunts your emotional development if you smoke before the adulthood. So me for example, I started smoking at age 15, so that would mean I kind of have the emotional maturity of a 15 year old even though I am now 35. We used the weed to cope back then, and we never learned how to process those emotions, instead we learned  to numb it out with weed. 

So apparently whenever issues trigger certain emotions, we tend to revert back to that 15 year old (or whatever age is was that you started if before adulthood).  At age 15 I definitely didn't have the coping skills to deal with the difficult emotions that would arise, nor did I develop the ability to problem solve! So when I consider all of that, it makes sense that whenever something triggers me (no matter how big the issue is, it FEELS like it's unmanageable, or the emotions that arise are TOO much), of course that 15 year old me is going to get overwhelmed and want to pull the blanket over her head.

 So, I guess it's all about learning new coping strategies. Being gentle on ourselves like we are brand new at this whole feeling our feelings, TRULY FEELING them, and then letting them go. Treat ourselves as if we are teaching a child. Once we learn the skills to manage the emotions, we can work on problem solving, and goal setting. I think that's when the weed doesn't matter as much anymore. Then you are just left with the whole missing weed BC of the social reasons or missing how it enhances certain activities/food etc. (Whatever your reason to continue long-term may have been). This is where creativity comes in I guess. I'm trying to figure this part out myself. Finding out what brings me joy. True pleasure that's not me ""consuming"" . 

 A quote that I heard regarding quitting weed that has stuck with me is this. ""Instead of seeking fulfillment in what you consume, try finding fulfillment in what you DO.""  This. This all the way. I realized weed had me reluctant to DO much of anything after smoking it daily. I was always looking for the next feel good thing to consume. (Even after smoking).  Whether it was other substances, impulse buying, constantly snacking on food, or Netflix/social media binging, it started to feel like nothing was good enough to fill that void. So that quote. Ah that quote. Reminds me that no amount of consuming is going to give me the same feeling that I would get from actually accomplishing something that I can be proud of!  

So ya. Only on day 12 but I've got tons of insights and I'm determined damn it! I know I'm in for a tough ride but every day I'm working on developing self confidence and that starts with goal setting. No matter how big or small the goal is, accomplishing a goal results in me feeling a sense of success and accomplishment. I'm done rambling now. Novel complete. Not even going to reread/edit this because, fuck perfection :)",147

**Money**

\-Get a nicer flat - get a dog  
\-Less stressing, more saving money  
\-Being able to afford nicer art supplies  


**Motivation**  
\-More energy  
\-More free time  
\-Actually go to social events instead of choosing to stay home and smoke  
\-Cook nicer meals (I love cooking, but usually can't be bothered)  
\-Keep my flat clean and always have clean laundry  
\-Gotta kick ass at university

**Health**  
\-Better skin  
\-Clearer eyes  
\-Healthy lungs  
\-Better sense of smell  
\-Better impulse control with food  
\-Energy to exercise  
\-Less anxiety

\-Higher sex drive  
\-Generally making improvements for our future

Long Term Goal: Never Smoke Weed Again In My Life. 

To summarize what happened this past weekend which propelled me to quit, I was staying on vacation with parents overnight Friday and Saturday in Kingston, ON. 🇨🇦 over the weekend at a Hotel Friday and Saturday night at 5:30, the wind was quite strong and too windy to light the bowl, I decided (an incredibly stupid decision) to smoke in the LOBBY washroom instead, by blowing the smoke down the toilet while flushing in one of the stalls. 

I'm actually very glad that whoever the desk manager at that time (5:30am) who called me out on it.

I knew this was odd, because he asked me afew questions, then asked me to leave the premises, then I told him what room number I was staying in and the name under it and that I was the son. 

He then said ""Okay no trouble, sorry about that, enjoy your stay."". 

However later, there had been the $250 smoking fine/fee applied to our bill, along with a voice message saying that I was not only smoking in the LOBBY washroom, but that I also seemed highly intoxicated, not just intoxicated, but ""highly intoxicated"" which is rather embarrassing. 

But I seized this opportunity that very day to completely give up marijuana entirely for as long as I can possibly go, this could very well mean the rest of my life. 

My thinking was so foggy when I ""abused"" the substance. 

here are some reminders to keep me sober. 

Consequences of starting back up smoking again;
-If I did, it would be a total waste. I could go a whole year without smoking weed and within a few weeks from whenever it was I smoked again, I would go right back to smoking everyday again, that would be a total waste and very disappointing as I have done this mistake repeatedly after every single tolerance break I took since the biggest one I've had since I started smoking. 

The Cannabis Addiction didn't happen overnight. 

I smoked on weekends and occasionally in my junior year of high school, Age 16 (Grade 11/2011-2012). 

Then the following year, Age 17 (Grade 12/2012-2013).  the obvious signs of cannabis addiction and dependency became far more clear. 

I still can continued to use marijuana everyday in my second year of being an over-aged student in high school, Age 18 (Grade12b/2013-2014). 

It lowered my social status, far more often than ever before, my cannabis use was negatively viewed, it was very honest, also they were abosutely right, and I had often had done wrong-doings. 

The biggest tolerance break that I ever did was over 53 days long, from (2014-10-12/2014-12-04).  

then in January of 2015, I went back to smoking every single day again. 

Over the winter of 2015, I felt like a zombie. 

I would smoke the access to the point where I wouldn't even enjoy it anymore, it actually became the opposite. 

It almost seemed as if I were smoking only to just get more sober then what I already was and it honestly felt horrible! 

I have also on more times than I can count, embarrass myself while under the influence of marijuana.

Originally, it caused me so much anxiety/ anxiety attacks. However, I pushed through it because all of my friends smoked. We were all in college, so it was just what we did to pass the time. But deep down I always felt that it changed me mentally. When I look back at who I was before I started binge smoking I realized I was organized, I made lists, I always put my priorities before anything else, and then to look at myself now I'am disappointed in who I have become. As of now my life  consists of going to work and then coming home to smoke weed. Thats it! Thats all I do. I'm just at the point were I want more out of life then just constantly numbing the pains of life. It has also gotten to the point were weed doesn't even effect me until I have had at least 3 bowls off a bong. 

 I have tried to quit several times, but it is so hard when the only friends I have now are weed smokers (even though I do love them dearly) it makes it hard to say no to smoking with them when all they want to do is  have a good time, and I don't want to ruin that for them. It also makes it extremely hard when my best friend always ridicules me whenever I want to quit.  She tells me "" You can't get addicted to weed."" or,  ""you're just being over dramatic."" She will even get angry with me if I say no to smoking when she comes over (even though I have no problem with her just smoking in front of me). It's just hard because I know I want this for myself, but I also want to keep my best friend.  Anyway, I know now more than ever that it is my time to quit. I know it's going to be so hard, but i'm so fed up with feeling this way and that is my motivation to finally say goodbye to cannabis.",1

This is my first time on this page, and reading these stories I’m already inspired to stop. I know it won’t be easy. I know I have told myself the same thing many times before. But something is different now, I just got back from my first meeting with an addiction therapist and I realized that the way I’m living isn’t really living. 
Around 3 years ago I started dating this guy that turned into my obsession, my first love, and a then drug dealer. I started smoking with him at first, and eventually bought my own stuff. After he cheated on me and broke my heart, I turned to weed to solve it and before I knew it I ended up here. 
While talking to the therapist, I realized that my daily mood and physical feelings are all symptoms of withdrawal. Because I smoke daily, when I’m not high I feel nauseous, tired, depressed, anxious, and get killer headaches. I loose all motivation. You guys already know this seeing as you’ve made it through the initial withdrawal battle, but to me it was kinda new info. I don’t want to be stuck binge eating and sitting on my ass anymore while the world moves around me. I only have one life, I have big plans for it, and I really don’t want to mess that up. The only way to do that is to stop cold turkey but I’m so nervous. Mostly that I’m going to slip up and give up from there.

It wasn’t up until yesterday when I went to my psyche to talk about my recent episodes of anxiety. After some discourse she identified that I’m having panic attacks, which I wasn’t really sure about, I’ve had a lot of anxiety problems but never really had severe panic attacks like this and even after experiencing them I never seen it simply as panic. When I’m high I seem to get mentally intrusive thoughts, that I can often obsess about, examples being very paranoid, often ambiguous hypochondrial ideas about myself. Like I might start thinking because I think about myself a lot that I’m a narcissist, or because I have emotional breakdowns, I might have a borderline personally. Like I’m latching on to these ideas and constantly freaking out about it. Sometimes I might think it’s possible that I might murder someone one day, even though that’s on the opposite side of the spectrum in my core values. Any situation that can be horribly negative, I’m thinking about it and relating to it, or contemplating on the possibilities of that happening.

Can anyone relate? Could this be caused by smoking weed? Or is it just an issue thats aggravated by it? I’ve smoked pretty regularly from the age of 15 I’m twenty now.",2

Things ive accomplished since quitting include waking up earlier every morning; cleaning my house and taking care of myself more frequently; being more active - not just going to the gym but taking hikes, climbing at a rock gym near my house, etc. 

Although it was hard to get through the initial stages of withdrawal, everyone around me was very supportive and understanding. I was irritated and my addict brain was not used to being without its daily spoonfed meal of dopamine. Being active made it easier to be without, as you naturally make dopamine when you exercise. I can now confidently say I feel that my emotions are how I truly feel, and are not just exaggerated or diminished as a result of drugs. Although the sadness and irritability i felt were very real when present, the happiness I feel is unlike any happiness I've felt in my life. It's true, and its pure.

I guess I'm just worried that when the smoke finally clears I'll just see myself staring back at me :/ 

Day one hasn't been terrible. I couldn't sleep last night and I missed class because i fell asleep at 6 am. But I got my taxes filed, I'm going to take my jeep to the shop tomorrow to get that god awful noise looked at, and I'm about to update my resume and apply for a job with a IT support platform where I can work from home and manage my own schedule so I can work around my schooling better. 

I'm so glad I found this sub. The timing couldn't have been more perfect. Plus writing down what I'm doing helps me realize that while I might be picking up the pieces, I'm still doing great so far. I eagerly anticipate the withdrawal, because I want to prove to myself that I really can do anything. I havent let myself down so far and I wont start now.",8

It's pretty much like no one cares or understands.  I tried to tell my mom that I've been struggling to quit marijuana and she actually now thinks I'm a heroin addict. What? I actually had a friend get back in touch with me from college tell me that sugar and color additives might be worse for us than weed - making me realize she smokes and not a good idea to stay in touch. I have basically had to completely isolate myself, only going to bars a few times which freaked me out just realizing how low I was going to ""reach out"". I've tried to go to churches = got totally freaked out by the shallow level of interaction. Just wondering if anyone knows how to make friends post pot head status?",1
2020-02-18 16:53:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f5ziqj/treat_weed_like_its_your_ex/,Treat weed like it’s your Ex,"Remember before you got in a relationship with an ex, you were most likely fine and enjoyed your life and hobbies. 

When you first broke up, oh boy did it sting, and suddenly all you could think about was every single positive thing that happened and suddenly they were an angel walking on earth that did nothing bad to you. 

Then, some times goes by, a few weeks... months... and eventually you realise not only are you fine, and happy again.. but realise that you were not meant to be with that person - clearly otherwise you wouldn’t have split up.

Of course this doesn’t correlate in every aspect, especially if you got dumped, but if you got dumped then that person wasn’t the one and you’ve had to deal with it and move on.

Weed is like a comfortable but not healthy relationship, where you’re clouded by the positives and ignore the negatives. Try and remember any negative feelings or experiences you had whilst smoking weed and use that as motivation to stop. 

For me, I can remember being paranoid that I was doing things to hurt my friends, or even just making up crazy scenarios of how anything in my life could go wrong. I also remember the times where after a long night of smoking, I would feel so incredibly ill, my throat would feel all closed up and tight.. and I’d wonder why I’d bothered getting so stoned - yet go back to it the next day.

Think of your wallet!!! I’ve realised over ~5 years smoking that I’d spent close to £25,000 on weed - and not to mention the silly amount I’ve spent on food at the same time.

Remember the times before you got into smoking and remember that there is a version of yourself that doesn’t need to be high.

Use it all day, every day, usually vape cartridges these days (I live in Canada, so it's legal and available). I think it's finally broken me. I'm at a point in my life where I really need a clean head - so much stressful, typically anxiety inducing stuff in my life at the moment. Weed is making everything worse. It always has, but hooked I remained. I've tried cutting back, only smoking socially, tapering off, weekends only etc. Nothing worked. I've got half a vape cartridge left, so 0.5g of distillate. I wanna bin it and quit straight up, but got that awful worry about regretting binning it when I start itching for the buzz. Any help hugely appreciated

The first 3 days of quitting were absolute hell. Aside from the nausea and anxiety, I was so insanely bored. I realize now how much I relied on weed to escape from reality. The sweet leaf allowed me to run away from my problems. Only for them to come back 10fold once I came down.

I have incredible energy and I can feel my mind sharpening. My memory is SO much better. And I have patience again. 

If you are thinking of quitting or are in the process, just remember that it is very possible! You lived the beginning of your life without it. I think many of us self medicate to run from the different bullshit that we all experience in life. 

I’m learning how rewarding it is to handle your problems face on. I can now reflect on how I must’ve looked to other people. Constantly making excuses for why I can’t do or achieve something. 

I have my confidence back. That in itself is absolutely life changing.

All this behind the back of my wife and at risk of losing my job (a good one).  I have tried to quit probably 100 times, but most of the time I only lasted a few days (or less).

24 days ago I ran out of weed, and on the same day I had a huge fight about weed with my wife during which she called me out about it in front of my ten-year-old daughter.  It was super fucked up, but it gave me the jolt that I needed to quit for real.

On a typical work day I was smoking first thing in the morning, on my way to work, at lunch, on my way home, and before bed after my wife went to sleep.  It was ingrained into my routine, and so the first week or so was very hard.  Routines doesn't change easy when you're 38 years old.  After 10 days or so, my comatose brain started to awaken and I was hit with a rush of anxiety, regret, sadness, and millions of other emotions that I had been muting with weed for years.  This was the hardest part, and I am frankly surprised I didn't cave.

I am still very emotional, but things are getting better, and I can say with confidence now that I truly don't think I'll ever call my dealer again.  At first I still thought I ""needed"" to meet my buddy once a week to smoke, but I've now come to the realization that I don't even need that.  It has no power over me anymore.  This has been one of the greatest achievements of my lifetime from a difficulty standpoint.

You can fucking do it.  When you fall, get back up again.  Keep trying.  Once you realize that your belief that you NEED to smoke is a lie, nothing can stand in your way.  I don't think you can force that realization, it just has to happen.  For me it took being shamed in front of my kid, but it doesn't have to be that way for you.

If you're young and you're using daily, take action now.  Don't wait until your 38 like me, or 45 or 55 years old like some of the folks on this board.  Take your life back before you waste a decade or two.

Good luck",15

I recently  discovered  the r/leaves area  and  all  the  positive  storys  and  Encouragement  motivated  me  to  quit  tomorrow....this  time  for  real!

Started Smoking when I was 16 occasionally(25 now), it soon became a daily ritual. At first only in the evenings, but after some time, It got to a point were I would lit up in the Morning within the first half our, of getting out of bed.

This is now my life for some years. Despite that, I am a happy Person, but I see that it holds back my true potential. I also see that it sabotages my success at University. As a student of a scientific degree beeing high as a kite sometimes simply does not help.

I also see that I use it in an unhealthy way, to cope with emotions und situations which I dont like.

So I tried to quit...for more times than I cant count over the years.

But enough is enough. I want to live life again without beeing influenced by a substance 24/7.

Congratulations to everybody who made it (even if just for a few days) and shared their story here on this board! This gives me a good feeling of not beeing alone in this situation.

The last times I tried to quit there was no community - so maybe this was the missing part for me that makes the change.

Thanks to everybody who took the time to read through my hole post!

I also apologize for any gramatical errors I may have included, as I am not a native englisch speaker :)

Now, I only just started reading it and I really like the way the book is written so I'll continue but it kindda hurt what I read starting at sublety #1 (page 14). 

I never knew what being indifferent actually meant until I read it today. Quick little disclaimer, I never have felt good about myself during my life so far. I finished high school (I'm from Holland) but after that I never got anything done. I was never really good at anything, never found something I really liked to do like a hobby or anything to study after high school (going to university to do a study there, not sure how to say it in English). After high school I started smoking a lot of weed to put all that away, did some things I hate myself for as well but after 4 years (last week) I wanted to change the way I look at things. I want to be more positive and loveable (I'm that guy in a group of friends that meets up with the gang from time to time but who never really hangs out with people individually) but too me I feel like I miss some kind of depth and engagement. I find it hard to keep conversations going because I don't have an opinion on 99% of the subjects people talk about. Or at least not in a way that I can express in words and can defend, explain and talk about further. 

So Mark Manson says that not giving a fuck is not the same as being indifferent, and to me he says that being indifferent is bad (which probably is true) but I didn't know what it meant before. The 2 pages that follow kindda hit home for me and now I feel worse then when I started this book...

2020-02-18 13:18:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f5w44r/crazy_anxiety/,Crazy Anxiety,"Hi

I'm in my early 40's and I need advice. I used to smoke regularly between the ages of 14 and 26, I stopped because it was taking over my life. Anyway fast forward 14 years and it became legal in Canada. Being the idiot I am I said to myself 'its legal now, how bad can smoking now and again be?'. That was about 15 months ago and I have smoked everyday since. I was still functioning and doing things but always stoned. 

Anyways about 3 or 4 weeks ago I had a bit of anxiety about some of the decision we've made in life but I was always OK with, such as not having kids. It went away in a few days but it wasn't like me, I feel a bit of anxiety every now again like everyone does but nothing like this. Two Sundays ago  I woke up in what was close to a panic attack about those same decision and tiny insignificant issues that I can't influence anyway. I kept smoking for a week hoping it would but nothing changed, I'm convinced its smoking that is making me feel like this. Has anyone experienced this?. 

So last Saturday (4 days ago) I decided to quit, its tough but I'm more scared of the anxiety. So far I'm still in a constant state of anxiety and fog to the point that I'm not really sleeping and although I'm not really thinking about anything in particular the anxiety is still there. Again can anyone relate to this and will it get better?. I liked getting stoned but this feeling is scary.",5

2020-02-18 12:38:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f5vhlq/weed_and_social_skills/,Weed and social skills,"I used to think weed helped me with my social anxiety because some of the best social interaction I have ever had has been high conversations.  I really do miss them, especially during my early days of smoking when everything was funny and it felt like it expanded my mind and it didn't just numb me.

However, I think reality is quite the opposite.  Slowly but surely I lost friends because of my habit.  I would avoid social interaction that didn't involve weed because I would prefer to just sit at home and smoke.  Before weed, I really enjoyed nightlife and going out to bars and stuff and I stopped doing that.  Whenever I would, I would only stay as long as I needed to before I'd rush home to smoke.  Slowly but surely my number of friends dwindled until I had just a couple, and my relationship with one of those was strained because of my smoking and how it changed me.

When it comes to meeting new people, I've always had social anxiety but I feel like weed and the fact that it caused me to live in my head has actually made it worse, especially in the latter days when I was smoking much more heavily.  I noticed it most when sober.  As soon as I had that first hit I was much more at ease.  I also feel like that once I was a heavy smoker and once weed became my identity, it became much harder to make new friends.  The friends I previously had, even those I smoked regularly with, were friends because we had something in common and some shared experiences other than smoking weed.  In all cases, we had been friends since before weed was in the picture.  In the end when weed was my life, how would I even relate to people who actually had lives, hobbies, and passions?  I moved to a new city in September and really felt like this has prevented me from getting my social circle established.

Also now, I feel like my social anxiety is the worst it's ever been but I'm blaming the withdrawal for that.  I'm hoping that once I get through this I can really start to feel like myself again in social situations and will find making friends to be a little easier.  Once I redevelop passions and reconnect with my hobbies and interests, maybe I'll be able to find people with common interests to develop real friendships with.",3

2020-02-18 10:44:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f5to3q/hello_leaves_im_ready/,"Hello Leaves, I'm Ready","  Hi everyone, my name is Andrew and I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a while but I'm finally ready to post about my own desires and goals to break away from this plant. This will be a long story because I have never told the whole thing to anyone. Most people don't want to hear about that kind of thing and have kept most of it to myself. Anyways...here we go.

  I was a heavy drinker in college, looking back, it went beyond the normal fun stuff I'd say. Reckless. At the end of my college career my 6 1/2 year relationship ended and I took it badly. I stumbled across easy access to weed and then, 11 years have gone by. Part of me is still expecting to snap out of this dream and wake up back in college so I can go about my life the way I always intended. I moved to work with my brother in law and went on a three year period of being pretty much completely alone (by my own doing).  No friends (new town and I made zero effort to remedy this), I blew family off left and right, I made questionable decisions based around weed and I started to develop massive anxiety and depression. More weed. Then my wife ""found"" me. I came home from a walk with my sister and there was a sticky note on my door saying something to the effect of, ""Hey, we should hang out. Give me a call!"" signed by ""Your friendly neighbor"".  We would be married 2 years later. 

  When I met my wife I had just gotten back from a visit to Colorado in 2013 and was fairly resigned to killing myself. I went as far as writing to as many people as I wanted to say something to. That sticky note changed everything. I had wanted to quit weed off and on during those three years alone but couldn't then when I met my wife and she was a smoker I was like, welp...let's smoke it up! In hindsight we were both very damaged people who both had/have massive codependency issues. We smoked every single day for at least 4 or 5 years. We had a beautiful home in the country on 3 acres with a creek, pets, decent living. My wife and I were miserable in part due to our substance abuse and not taking care of our physical selves and perhaps not being ready to actually tackle the root of some of our own individual emotional issues. We both got laid off within a month of each other, sold our home and we took my 401K (all of it) and moved to Colorado in 2016. We blew every cent we had on mostly drugs and beyond that, things that I have nothing to show for...almost 30K gone in about 6 months. On top of that my wife's dog, Jake, passed away at the age of 8. He was a black lab/german shepherd mix and was insanely loyal to both of us and extremely protective of my wife. He was such a good boy. We took him to the vet because we thought he had stomach issues or maybe ate chicken bones out of the garbage, found out he had severe cancer. He was put down 2 days later on the Thursday of that same week. Walking out of the vet with only his collar and leash is one of the most difficult things I have ever done. Even though I only knew Jake for 2 of his 8 years I loved him so much. I'm grateful that he had those 3 acres to run around on while he could after living in so many apartments. We also got JoJo, an Enlish Mastiff who became Jake's best friends. Losing Jake made everying so much worse and we responded the only way we knew how. So much weed, and shatter, and wax, and pens, and edibles, and joints, and cannabis drinks. Holy shit the amount of psychedelics...Jesus Christ.  I don't know how we became so lost, we're fairly intelligent people. I think. We were a financial and emotional disaster...life in Colorado was rough on our psyche and it all changed when my wife became pregnant.

  We found out my wife was pregnant about 2 weeks after she was released from a psych ward after expressing desires to hurt herself to her doctor. We moved back home, made it through the pregnancy (I forgot to mention my wife has a history of clinical depression, anxiety, and bi-polar disorder) which was very difficult on us both. Obviously more-so for her but we definitely both were not doing well mentally. Things progressed, slowly getting better and our son is so unbelievably amazing. It doesn't make sense how perfect he is. Despite all of the slow but positive changes and the diminishing usage of cannabis, I still wasn't living the life I wanted to for myself (and I feel I haven't since I was 14). I have much that is hard to remember about my son's earliest days. I made so many poor choices and enough is enough. 

  My wife and I are currently separated, living in different homes while splitting time with our son. It's been this way since November and I am mentally and emotionally crushed on a daily basis. A huge issue that added to all of this is my wife became emotionally attached to a man...my fucking alcoholic boss. The other thing that pains me is that I don't feel we've ever given this relationship a fair chance while being sober and more emotionally healthy. I feel we are at the best version of ourselves now but my wife has lost the love she had for me. That's a whole other post for some other time. The bottom line is this, I have not lived my life according to how I picture it in my head and if I want to truly achieve that...the drugs have got to go. So, the other day I gave what I had left of an 1/8th and about a 1/2 gram of shatter and 2 hits of LSD (all that's left from a sheet of 100). I'm not doing this for my family, friends, wife or even my son. I am doing this for me.

  I wish all of you success in your lives and hope that we all can achieve to be exactly who we want to be without the fog of drugs or thinking that someone else has our answers. You have to be selfish about this. Love, happiness, contentment...it all comes from yourself. We are all capable of it, but trying to do that while involved with substances is like riding a bike with square wheels.  I have no ill will towards cannabis or responsible intake of most substances honestly but I can't do that. I have to be done and hopefully, I will be.

Today I've made it 3 weeks without weed after being a daily smoker for 5+ years. The cannabis free life has been amazing, and honestly I have no desire to smoke a bowl at this point.

What I've noticed is that because I'm no longer smoking every night, I feel like I need/deserve something to ""take the edge off"" and I've been drinking more than I did when I was smoking. I've never felt I had a problem with alcohol, and have certainly never felt the same way about alcohol as I did about weed. However I don't like how much I've been drinking the past few weeks. I think I've only had 3 days where I didn't have a drink, and yesterday was a shit day and I drank most of a bottle of wine and feel worse this morning.

Part of me wants to quit and part of me doesn’t want to. Sometimes I wonder if I really need to quit or if I’m just over-thinking everything. I only smoke at night after all my responsibilities are done so sometimes I wonder what’s the big harm. Even though I intuitively know that I probably shouldn’t. To be honest I went a whole year without it and I guess I didn’t notice this huge difference. Instead of smoking I used other vices like junk food and tv to forget about my problems and to be lazy. I guess I expected that year to be super productive and when it wasn’t and nothing really changed I thought it’s not even weed after all. I’m just lazy. It’s just me. That’s just who I am. Yet I know it doesn’t HELP those things. Uhg. Just ranting. And could use any advice,4

1. Never smoke alone
2. Don't smoke at home
3. No more then $50 a week on bud

Interesting, isnt it?! But I wanna share one story with you guys. 

First of all, I am socially anxious person. Not extremely, but I definitelly have social anxiety. I had very awkward encounter with one of my sisters friends like 1 year ago. 

I went to a party where I managed to seduce this girl (to this day I still dont know how I did it, she is solid 8/10) It was in those times where I was toking on regular basis. Well, we got to my place and I couldnt get it up, I also told her how great sex it will be (I cringe just typing it here) and then, like month later I basically told her she is a party girl (but I didnt mean it in wrong way, it was meant to be a joke and she didnt get it, she thought I was slut shaming her) It was very awkward this whole situation.

And now, my sister had a prome and there was this girl and all of her friends (they definitelly knew about this awkward situation between me and her) 

As you can imagine, I was anxious as fuck just thinking about going there, but I did go there after all. 

Well, guess what, her friends were nice and friendly, but this girl...oh man, when I was greeting her and giving her kiss on the cheek (in a friendly way, just as I did with all her female friends) Her face expression was like: ""I am absolutely disgusted with you, dont even touch or look at me"" she also had her boyfriend there. 

Well, the night went on, I wasnt socialising very much, but then there was this girl on the dance floor. She was absolutely gorgeous, perfect 10/10. Most beautiful girl on the dance floor for sure. I went and approached her, got rejected but felt actually amazing. No guy had the balls to even think about approaching her (for good reason) but I did it and felt great despite rejection. 

Then I went and approached second girl and she said yes to dancing with me! I never actually took any classes and it was little awkward, but I felt great. 

What I wanna say by telling you this story? If I didnt quit I would probably stay home, my anxiety would win over me. But that didnt happen and I actually felt like I have some courage after all. Because all my life I have been kind of coward, especially in social situations and especially when it comes to girls.

I realise that I have been using weed to mask this and bunch of other issues, but now I feel this could actually be the first step for real self improvement, for some serious progress, new chapter. 

Since I quit those 14 days ago, my overall anxiety definitelly lessened and I am very excited what comes 1 year from now, especially because I am starting a business which makes sense and could actually be successfull in it, but thats whole another story. 

I just wanted to share this with you guys. Maybe you can relate, please comment your thoughts about this.

I think that if I wouldnt quit weed, I would miss my sisters prome thanks to fear and anxiety and I would regret it till the end of my life. 

Stay Strong. You will eventually get there, no matter what your goal is if you keep pushing, but you cant keep pushing if you drive only on 1st gear every day (smoking weed)",3

I wouldn’t say that I’m exactly sober because I keep on relapsing every other day. 

I decided to get clean on the 10th February after deeply reflecting on my obsessive behavior to use marijuana to feel some kind of pleasure. I relapsed two days after. Felt like shit. Then I’ve quit again for three days and was feeling pretty optimistic but in the morning on the 5th day I relapsed again. I truly thought about it and tried to be self aware about what my triggers were and just to observe my behavior without being too hard on myself, because what was the point if I just kept on feeling guilty and like shit for relapsing, I do feel guilty and like shit for relapsing and letting my addiction get the best of me, but somehow with each relapse I feel that there’s a deep hatred for this substance and I’ve started to notice it on any people who smoke. 

One of my colleagues at work was offering me a joint saying“Smoke man! you’ll feel good! you’ll work better!”. After I refused and told him that I’m trying to kick the habit off he just chuckled and went about his day. 30 minutes later I found him sleeping on his desk while I was working and doing fine work actually, and I just remembered myself when I used to get high and feel that buzz and at the end nothing is achieved, just pure laziness. I also felt great for not wanting to be like that guy, even though I wasn’t a month sober or anything, but still there’s a deep intention in me to stop. I don’t like it anymore. It’s causing me more harm than good. 

So I realized that my usual relapse time would accrue on mornings, I used to love to wake’n’bake, and was my preferred time of the day to smoke. Now the last time I smoked was this morning and I broke off my three days sobriety. I truly want this to be the last time. 

One of the major problems is that I live in a household full of stoners, aka my big brothers, they just won’t quit and can’t really hide their stuff or lock it in a safe so I can’t reach to it. I can’t exactly move out and don’t know what to do about it. So that’s why my habits were enabled and that’s why I relapsed a lot, because I know I can find weed just the next room. 

I went to an NA meeting yesterday and afterwards I felt great and slept okay, when I woke up I felt desperate to smoke a joint and the cravings were taking over me so I smoked a joint and broke my sobriety again. Addiction is a bitch. Everyone needs help. Don’t be too ashamed or too proud to ask for it. 

Here I am, realizing that my relapse was a mistake and trying to correct the wrong, I know that I have to fix what’s in me, spiritually and clinically. 

Looking forward for this day, I pray that I kick this shit once and for all.",3

I was supposed to go into nuclear weapons in the USAF until they discovered I had smoked weed. Cant get a top secret security clearance in the military if you have a record of drug usage. I had almost finished boot before I was reassigned to go into maintenance. There I was relieved of duty after having my shift shuffled over and over, making me regularly late as I never kept a sleep schedule for longer than 2 weeks. 

I celebrated when I got home. It was party time and I could smoke and drink all I fuckin wanted. It's been almost 2 years since then. Quitting drinking was easy. I wasnt an alcoholic or anything. Might've been close but whose counting? But to stop smoking weed, that's a different story. Everything infuriates me to a point where it's all I can do to keep myself from punching and kicking and throwing anything expensive. 

It's time I quit for good. I cant keep doing this to myself. I imagine I will probably end up posting here a couple of times a day, but it's because the lack of thc destabilizes my mood so badly that every day for about a week turns into a bad day.

I want to share some of my thoughts with this community.

I've seen many posts here that helped to raise an important questions all the way through constant negotiation with my own conscience.

I am 23 years old. I stopped smoking this night for real. 

I was a perspective young boy doing all kind of geeky stuff through elementary school and high school. I mean I was attending Robotics, Biology, Physics, Maths, Chemistry and Geography tournaments.

At the end of highschool , I was around 18, I started smoking weed and now 5 years later here I am.. 

I feel like weed took a lot from me.
Important things just passing by not affecting my smoking habits..
In the end that was the only habit I was left with.

I can't remember memories with friends that happened to affect them positively or hurt them.

But when I got to know what a person I became and  when reality stroke with a backfire I found excuse after all to handle it puffed and relaxed. Experiencing ""a spiritual connection"" with running from responsibilities.

I hope to get through this and find a balance.

really tried quitting last month and ended up smoking like 12/31 days but I kept relapsing every 5-6 days and relapsed harder recently it's like I even forgot all my efforts and back to rolling J's after J's even before finishing the current one cause I forget everything when I'm high.

I know it hurts my motivation Soo bad .When I was feeling ""sober"" last month I was a much better version of myself, was experiencing feelings I didn't feel since a long time, was cooking healthy, exercising,making music ,wanting to follow my dreams.

For a little bit of background: 23(M) started smoking in  Engineering school at 19 , and quickly it went from just smoking with friends to smoking alone and playing games, I stopped going to all my classes except the mandatory ones (and even those I missed a lot which caused me a lot of issues) I was studying only the nights before the exams on incredibly hard subjects and baked 😂,on the side I became really good at the video games I was playing (of course I was doing that all day) and even made decent money with it , sooo many time I wanted to just say fuck to school to play really professionnaly but my parents convinced me not to , I thank them now.
Somehow and with a lot of problems I graduated and got a really good degree and landed a well paid job in software engineering which I would say I like.

Weed has a big hold on me, way more than what I thought. It was so easy justifying using it those last few years considering I was ""successful"" but I wasn't , it destroyed my relationships , destroyed my motivation , destroyed my self-esteem,and destroyed the notion of time -those years flew by I don't remember shit,it's all mixed-
I don't even care about the money , sure it's a nice bonus but I just want myself back , I was a kid with such big dreams ,was successful both in sports and studies, always felt like school was holding me back as it was pretty easy for me  and liked the grind of professional sports but followed studies as my parents pushed it , it's a shame you only realize how important it is once you're out there , I have everything in my hand to start living a good  life now , I just need to ditch MJ and it feels harder than everything I've done.

Ever since I realized how bad it was for me I don't even like the high anymore yet I keep rolling and smoking, it's as if I'm in an abusive relationship with MJ , I have always been really bad with breakups so I have a hard time letting Marie go, especially since she calls back so often.

Reading all of this sub posts helps a ton with me actually trying to quit, some of the posts here are inspirational.
Much love to y'all

I’m at a point where I want to quit for good. I’m scared because I’m unemployed, living alone (except weekends as I am a parent) circle of friends diminished, still grieving loss of relationship (10 years long). Everything is a restart for me which I’m grateful for, but I feel like when I quit all of the emotions of what’s be going on will come thru tenfold and I’ll relapse and or become agitated and anger. I actually have a desire to quit. I want to better myself for me and my kiddo. My anxiety and depression are horrible and I know weed is just a crutch to make it through whilst not addressing my anxiety and depression issues responsibly. 

I feel like I need some sort of distraction to quit. I have been trying to get work the last 2 months but to no avail. That being said, I tossed my ego aside and have been applying at any min wage jobs to get my working and fill a good part of my days. I feel like I have too much time on my hands now to quit even though I want to. I don’t have enough distractions around me. My friends who are around for the most part all smoke. I don’t know sober people. 

Im looking for advice on how some of you made it work once your desire to quit became more than the desire to continue. How did you find a way to distract yourself some the withdrawals and desire to lean back on the old crutch.",4
2020-02-17 17:00:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f5gk23/1_month_off_everything/,~1 month off everything,"I was a daily stoner for the better part of a year, minus the summer. i also am addicted to nicotine. i’ve been off weed for about a month and off most nicotine since the new year. i’ve slipped on nicotine a couple times but have gone 2 weeks without hitting a vape. 

my reasons for quitting were health related. i’ve had asthma my whole life and the damage to my lungs really caught up with me. the two weeks immediately after quitting were the worst, i was constantly anxious and worried i was just going to die. but it was still better than how i felt when on these substances. 

every time i’ve smoked since around mid december has been terrible. i felt super anxious, i felt short of breath, and i felt my heart beating like crazy. i don’t know why this happened out of the blue, but i’m glad it did. my grades were slipping and i’ve entered my hardest college semester yet. 

i hate weed now. i hate the smell, i hate the laziness, i hate how much of a waste of money it was. i feel bad for wasting my parents’ money on it and i feel bad for being a lazy piece of shit for a year. i have no desire to go back to smoking ever, but maybe i’ll change my opinion come summer time if i get an internship. 

i am happy to be substance free. i don’t really even drink that much anymore, despite being in a fraternity and having a good environment to drink in. it just doesn’t have the same allure as it did last year. maybe i’m growing up. 

thanks for reading, just wanted to make a note of how far i’ve come and share my reasons for quitting and why i want to keep going strong. 

my advice to those who want to quit: it’s the best thing you can do for your mental and physical health. drugs are not good for you, even if they may be fun. replace your smoking with going to the gym and eating right. it really helps.",6

Ramble alert!

TL:DR Compassion and kindness is key even to yourself.

Made it thank bleeding God. Not sure if it's psychological or my particular journey / body but day 4 always sucked ass big time for me and I don't want to ever have to suffer it again. Thanks MJ but you're dumped!

My journey is slightly complex to quantify... I'm 5 days (or 120 hours) sober of my last joint but had started the journey days before and relapsed in the most controlled way ever (totally suprised myself by not binging, kinda proud actually 😂🤦🏼‍♀️) so I'm not sure whether I'm day 5 or day 11?

I point this out cos sometimes people want a comparison and if they look at their own day 5 and compare to mine they may be disappointed they aren't there too. But remember, the competition is with yourself not other people. 

I saw a poster say that our struggles can put people off and I get that I do. But if one of us is struggling and needs to understand it they can see that's it's not just them, it's normal and they'll be okay. Let's be honest, how many of us would have got here into addicts if we'd known what would happen. And when you're an addict at times you find excuses to keep going no matter what. That won't change until that internal click happens and that's on the individual.

No one else can have that light bulb moment for you, it has to come from inside.

Side effects I'm having are:

Sweaty palms (not too bad and if I don't wind myself up about it it fades. Over thinking it and stressing just makes it worse) I'm exhausted (can't switch my brain off at night but that was a problem BEFORE weed) and I'm kinda sad. But not sad enough to bloody smoke so just got to work it.

Seem to have conquered the nausea, lack of appetite and the mania I get when I first detox. And they're the side effects that really fuck me up you know? Vile experience.

Reached out to some friends today as UK peeps will probably know that a well known celebrity committed suicide over the weekend and in a world full of sadness and feeling isolated I don't want that for my friends. And I'm glad I did, cos people I care about are suffering and struggling. No one is ever alone, even if it's a stranger all of us have the power to save someone, even if it's only ourselves (which is massive actually, no one knows how much they are loved until it's too late) Even those people who we are jealous of who seem to have it all can be suffering in ways we can't even comprehend never mind predict.

Kindness costs nothing. Tell someone you care about them, it may be the light they need (even if you just look in the mirror and say it to yourself... you can be your own light.) 

This has ended up being a massive ramble and more about mental health than weed sorry but I think some of us have got to addict stage because of mental health so it's connected. And isn't that what life is about? Making connections? And is a good life just the choice of making good ones over bad? I know not.

Anyways, as always stay strong everyone ❤️

Long story short, I was in a relationship with a girl for about 5 months. But it was intense and we fell fast. We broke up in July/August. It was ME that ultimately pulled away from her due to emotional issues.

I continued to vape from a pen somewhat regularly ever since and its now been about 7 months. I still feel that I'm not over her. Over these 7 months I've missed her very hard. Every time I'd vape, I'd think about her. The funny thing is, when I was with her, I didn't want to be after a while. I'm now starting to think if I quit when we broke up, would I be way over her by now?

Does THC make you more emotional and depressed even though the very reason we do it is to escape? I truly think I would be in a healthier mental state and over her if I stopped after the breakup. I feel its only made me obsess and overthink our relationship... and also glorify it into something it wasn't.

TLDR; I feel THC only prolongs negative feelings and emotions in a break-up or traumatic experience. It can help in the moment, but it creates a depressive brain fog that makes it harder to rationalize and get through hard times in life.",3

I honestly thought it would be harder than that giving the fact that most people here are stoners but I kept my shit together.

An interesting thing happened today, 

I told my story of me fighting for sobriety to one of my close and trusted co-worker, of course I should’ve known better, I realized how in denial this guy is and trying to brush of my problem as some kind of funny decision, and after that he just offered to join him and smoke a joint ( which I was desperately craving ) but I held my shit together and fought the need and I explained to him that I no longer need the substance and that I wish for him not to offer me again and respect what am going through ( because sobriety, and understanding that weed truly does harm, is serious and a no laughing matter ).

Anyway during the break time I saw him going in to his car which I could’ve easily join him, but I took a deep breath and remembered why am doing this, and went to my car and locked the door and meditated for about 15 minutes and went back to work. 

Now I understand how delusional addiction can make you be and I’m glad i’m taking a positive step to clean up my life.

This was a little over three years ago now. This isn't as long for many/most of you here, and I'm sure the consequences of my actions are not as dire as many of the experiences I've read about on this sub but I just want to get this off my chest.   From the first time I smoked I was hooked, I started smoking alone literally the second or third time I ever smoked, I'd sit alone in my room and smoke J after J after J for hours until I was too stoned to think coherently.  I've been smoking like that almost daily now up until last night.  Today I feel like shit, I'm stressed, I missed an assignment in one of my classes, I have NO motivation to do anything but eat and go to the gym (probably because nothing gets me going anymore unless it's some kind of visceral rush).  I'm graduating in like 2 months and I can't help but think that I've smoked my ENTIRE college experience away.  Not only this but I seriously feel like I lost some mental capabilities, I used to consider myself pretty smart but now I just feel like a slow thinking loser with no personality, goals, or ambitions who doesn't even know what day of the week it is half the time.  I've become a closeted nihilist, I've lost touch with my faith, and I'm cynical and distrustful of EVERYTHING. Worst of all, I don't enjoy music the way I used to, when I'm not stoned I can't really *feel*** anything.  I can't help but blame my unhealthy relationship to marijuana.  It's really unfortunate because I think pot is an amazing substance for so many reasons, I wasn't responsible and now I'm dealing with the consequences.  

So today is day 1.  Starting now, no matter how uncomfortable it makes me, no matter how hard it is for me to sleep, no matter how left out I feel when others around me are smoking I'm done.  I've had my fun and I'm ready to be a human fucking being again.

(Or anything else new and stimulating),"Honestly, this really worked for me. I’ve always loved languages (learnt a fair amount of French but in particular German in my life) and have now started dedicating a good amount of my free time to learning Chinese (mandarin). 

Half the time when we crave a joint, even after spending some time away from it, it’s because we are doing the same activities that we really enjoyed when high. Doing something like learning a language can really stimulate you, and as you progress the endorphins kick in as you realise you are progressing.

Obviously this won’t work for everyone, but try getting something like this into your daily routine - even after some studying your brain switching into a different gear and really thrives off this new challenge!!

I'm on day 3 and having trouble. Today I woke up to an e-mail I wrote myself a year ago on [futureme.org](https://futureme.org). It's a website that allows you to set a specific date and time to send an e-mail to yourself in the future. A year ago today I had stopped smoking, and the e-mail was to congratulate me on one year smoke-free. My girlfriend and I just had a long talk about why this time was so hard, and we came to the conclusion that it was because I wasn't replacing pot with anything. I was just abstaining and it wasn't really working. I was still a bum on the couch. The timing on this is just such a coincidence that I see it as a sign. It helped me see what the positives are from not smoking, and that I have to get back into my hobbies in order to deal with the withdrawal symptoms and to really start practicing my recovery. It helped me see that I'm not doing this for my GF, my Mom, or anyone else; I'm doing this for me and for my benefit. I can't rely on my desire to please someone else to give me motivation, because that is not going to cut it in the long run. I have to take this journey for myself.

I really just couldn't believe that I just had a long conversation about the very same thing I wrote in an e-mail a year ago and received it today as soon as I woke up. I just wanted to share that.

I knew that when I left on this trip that I would use it as an opportunity to quit smoking weed. I also knew that the first week or two would be very hard due to jet lag and withdraw symptoms. 

Now I've quit weed probably a dozen times in my life. Half the times were easy peasy and the other half were soul sucking adventures, but the common theme is that I've quit 12 times.... and returned to smoking 12 times. 

For the first few days I was EXTREMELY tired, but I didn't beat myself up because I knew it was the jet lag. However, after those first few days, I couldn't blame it on the jet lag. I knew that I was feeling tired, no appetite, brain fog, anxious because of not smoking weed. But I forced myself to do things for the next 3 or 4 days, even though I didn't really want to.

Now, I am on day 8, and purposefully went to a cheap location, got myself a really nice room, and I'm ready to chill until I'm ready to continue on. In these short few days, I've been feeling guilty. 

""Spiritual-Kitchen, you've saved up money and have been planning this for years, what the fuck are you doing being lazy and unmotivated?"", I thought to myself many times. Hell, I'll probably say it again later tonight. 

For the past few days, I've been sleeping an ungodly amount of hours (hell I can do a whole post on how weird/interesting my sleep has been), waking up feeling TERRIBLE and just allowing myself to be ok with watching movies and tv shows while I'm in this foreign country. 

This is a process and it's normal to feel this way. I've abused my body for years with a foreign substance and it won't just be perfectly fine after not inhaling this substance any more. This shit will take time. But at 2pm today, when my hunger became too great to be lazy anymore, I went for a walk, grabbed some food, talked to some people who were curious about me being an obvious tourist in a non-touristy city. I'm glad I went out for the hour, but I started feeling anxious and was craving being in my room alone again, which I'm doing now. And you know what? THAT'S OK. This is not the normal me. This is the temporary me. Repeat it again. THIS IS THE TEMPORARY ME. 

Later tonight I will throw on a hat and some headphones in and force myself to do a light workout at the gym in the building I'm staying in. Then I'll go straight back to my room again. And that's ok.

Moral of my story is that this shit isn't easy. This will take some time. I will feel terrible for a while with some good moments sprinkled in. Eventually I will feel good with some terrible moments sprinkled in. Then later I will feel good again. This is a process. 

So go ahead and lay down, watch a movie, take a day off work if you can. As long as you are making steady progress and making a small effort like I did today, you are on the right track. There is nothing to feel guilty or ashamed of.

I've also realized that I've never gone more than a couple of weeks as a full time professional without being a mad stoner. This ends now. I'm going to use this opportunity of free time in a foreign land to heal and become the best version of myself, then go and have the time of my fucking life surfing, diving, and soaking up the sun. 

If you have a shit ton of PTO saved up and the timing is right, use it. You only live once so stop wasting it being in a stoned haze your whole life. Quit now. Go through the struggle and the pains of quitting. Accept that the struggle and the pains will be there. Then start the steps of becoming the you that you've always thought about.

**IF NOT NOW, WHEN?**

You know the answer to that question. So just make it NOW.

I know this is a rant and it's probably more therapeutic for myself to type it, but I hope somebody can take something away from my rambles.",68

Found friends that do weed and kinda started doing it on a regular basis and like two months later I found myself smoking bowls each day. My day was just work - smoke, watch videos, eat junk  - smoke a huge bowl to be able to fall asleep. More and more I fell into the hole until I wasn't able to do daily chores at home anymore. Must have been like 2 years until I decided to stop for the first time. It took some tries but I managed to stop smoking for 6 months. That was my biggest break. But I got back into it after I felt good on a weekend and a friend asked me if we want to smoke. Had some leftover weed on monday and ofc smoked it. Poof, back in the game, back to smoking bowls aswell. Some months later I developed a depression and could'nt get out of it for a long time. 

I then moved to a new city in july and thats where my current situation starts:

I smoked a lot,  because I didn't know anybody here but eventually found friends that I do like being around. Sidenote: I always was a shy guy, a little social anxious so it always feels easier to just stay home and smoke instead of doing something with friends, go out or whatever. Atleast I dont smoke bowls anymore because these killed me.

Since moving here I had a lot of weed breaks, but never more than 10 days.

It feels so hard to get out of it again. I just stayed at home the whole last weekend to smoke and eat junk, play video games and watch videos. I am feeling really useless and I really want to stop. But life feels so hard to me. I can't remember the time where I was clean and happy. At the moment I am able to skip smoking on weekdays but its a torture because all my thoughts resolve about getting high and run away.

I'm in therapy because of my social anxiety and  I am lying to my therapist about not smoking weed anymore.  I'm scared that she could kick me out because she mentioned that therapy while smoking weed isn't working. I don't think so because its helping me. 

All my new friends in this new city are smoking or doing other drugs, it's really hard for me not to get tempted or find new friends in general. 

I wish I could press a reset button and be free again. Anyone got some advice for me? Feeling helpess.",2

That’s all it takes. Sometimes, it takes trying it again one time to throw away a clean lifestyle streak. Because if you try it once, you’ll do it again and again. And then you’ll find yourself at step one.

71 days clean has been the most clean I’ve been since before I tried weed for the first time. It was great! I lived a normal and advancing life. A life that would have been given to me at 17 had I not smoked weed a shit load. 

Some benefits were:
- Good job, Good coworkers
-Good pay
-Moved our and began renting for the first time
-Live comfortable alone
-Free to work on what I want on my time

A couple of nights ago I started to get the itch as well and then I really started thinking about it.  Quitting weed isn't my end goal here.  It's the start.  What would I be rewarding myself for if I smoked now?

My goals for the next year is to do the following.

- Find a new job
- Establish a social circle in my new city that doesn't revolve around smoking
- Take up a new hobby and reconnect with my old passions
- Work on my physical fitness
- Live more in the moment instead of spending so much time ruminating
- Start dating

In order to accomplish any of these things, weed cannot be a part of my life.  I have to get back into my natural frame of mind.  To reward myself with weed now would be like popping the champagne to celebrate winning a race when I've only started the car.",38

1. DREAMS. I am dreaming again for the first time in over a decade. It’s not every night but  some nights my dreams are vivid and memorable.

2. No more putting things off for tomorrow. I no longer wait around to do menial tasks. Things like washing dishes and picking up trash just happen in the moment. There is no longer this existential dread or the inevitable procrastination. 

3. I’m more appreciative of my time. I’m not sure why but looking back on last Sunday when I quit seems way longer than a week ago. Before when I smoked weeks seemed to blink by. 

That’s all for now but I hope to see more benefits as the weeks progress. Of course I will update this forum as well. Good Luck to everyone who’s been trying to quit. You got this.",13

Because honestly sometimes I feel like the people around me judging me, expecting me to be the type of person they want me to be, and put me down for not recovering fast enough. 

I’m sober for a week now and my wife just keep on bombarding me with therapy clinics and go for a walk or going to gym which I understand. She cares about me and want me to get better I’m not saying no. But I just keep putting it off, I mean I don’t plan to stay home and do nothing but I just time for myself to reflect if that makes sense. I just started meditating two times a day for 10 minutes each session which does help a lot. I believe that the root of my problem is spiritual not clinical. 

My wife thinks that it’s a weakness and I’m drowning myself in sorrow. 

I told her I’m not saying no, I just don’t feel like going out right now or seeing a therapist or be pressured. 

My wife told me hurtful truths today that I don’t know if she even means it. She said that this guy I am now ( struggling to recovery ) is not the guys she met, and that she’s disappointed in me, and that I am refusing help ( which I’m not ). I tried talking to her to explain to her but she just won’t listen and keeps misinterpreting my words. I don’t know if that’s me or what but sometimes I feel like she’s toxic to me and could possibly be a trigger for me to start using again. 

I love my wife and I know she’s trying to help as much as she can but maybe because she was never an addict she might not understand. 

Any advice?",1

I hope I can inspire some people to do the same (those who truely do have/experience problems with cannabis use that negatively effect others).","It is never an easy thing to admit when one has a problem with abusing a particular substance, that is always the first step. 

From 2011 until now, I was ignorant and arrogantly in denial that I had a problem with my cannabis use. 

NOW, it is very clear to me that I infact DO have a problem with everyday cannabis consumption. 

I (24/m) have decided to quit using Cannabis entirely.  

from Saturday February 15th 2020 to Thursday July 9th 2020. 

I do not plan on consuming any cannabis in between those two dates which equals out to 145 days.

if I achieve this goal, (exceeding half of 289 days) my next goal from SunJul9 onwards is to not use it again even after I'm 25 this summer (MonJul27). 

Every single time I started back up again, even after a prolonged break, That first time smoking up again after a long break is usually always great, but I went right back to where I was within a week or so. I don't want to keep on repeating that same mistake. 

I have spent so much of my time being demotivated from Cannabis, that it consumed not only money, but also a lot of time. 

The money really isn't the issue, I can always get more money the time I blown in any term, I am never getting back. 
 
It's not even about the time I wasted getting high, It's also the NOT doing things I would once enjoy doing sober, after I got high. (activities, tasks, it even got to the point where responsibilities were involved that I pushed aside/blew off that cost me in the long run). going for a walk, watching a good movie, enjoying a good hobby, helping out a friend, or just simply being productive and not counter-productive, I would frequently not even bother doing any of those things after I got high. 

Smoking weed only the weekends was easier as an inexperience 16 year old at the time (2011/2012 school season/Jr Yr HS). 

Nowadays, it is just simply too hard. I'd always be craving mad Sunday-Thursday wishing it were Friday or Saturday night. 

I now would much rather not smoke at all, and have zero compulsions/addictive behaviours to weed. 

If I gave up smoking weed, my family would be proud of me, my friends would be proud of me, my co-workers would be proud of me, even myself would be proud of me. 

If there is anyone else doing with cannabis addiction like myself/millions of people around the world.

Most people yes, can use cannabis daily without problem. But I am not one of them. 

I am not most people, I am one of the still many millions  from around the world who suffer significant problems with cannabis usage.

I had a really good, eye opening day at work. I had fun doing something and making money. I had a customer come in and yell at me for really trivial bullshit and doing things the way everyone does them. He accused me of being high and it felt good to be sober in that circumstance. My manager told him not to come back so I really wasn't doing anything wrong. 

I had alot of positive interactions with customers after that and got alot of tip money. I felt really good about myself. Then a worker from a psych ward I had recently been in came through and it was a really funny when we recognized each other. They were one of the better ones there imo. It reminded me of where smoking all this weed had led me in the past: false diagnosis they mistook withdrawal for ""behavioral disorders."" 

Then I was clocking out and pondering about using. I was kind of hungry and there was a Wendy's on my route home. I realized how much I wanted to just eat a large sandwich. Then I thought about how prior to being clean (1 month) I would need weed to feel hungry and how I wouldn't really appreciate the food but moreover ""rape"" it with my mouth. I decided to buy a big combo with my money instead. I really enjoyed it and my day made me feel as though long term sobriety is achievable. I'm really happy I didn't buy weed.",7
2020-02-16 22:11:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f52769/first_time_poster_my_using_history_and_recovery/,"First time poster, my using history and recovery.","Hey all, I’ve been lurking here since June of last year, and I made an account to tell my story. It’s very long, but I’ve been wanting to tell it for a while.

I’m a 22 year old female, turning 23 soon. I smoked weed for the first time late 2015 with my ex-fwb and her friends. She told me I didn’t have to partake but I was curious and always wanted to try. It took a ton of hits to get high, and I had a lot of fun that night. I didn’t try again until a few months later with my bf’s now ex-gf. I didn’t know how to use a pipe properly and inhaled a burning piece of nug which hurt like a bitch. I also had my first edible. I used half then and saved the other half for another night after work. 

Late 2017 for some reason I wanted to smoke again after not using for a year and decided to hit up a high school friend who I knew used. We went on a car ride a few days later and smoked a joint but I felt nothing. I asked if I could buy some weed off him so I could try again at home. After work I bought a pipe and lighter and smoked a few more times with no success. A few days later he let me use his homemade gravity bong. It was a 2-liter bottle and I inhaled the entire thing. He was extremely impressed. I felt the cotton mouth immediately and asked for water. I didn’t get to take a sip before needing to lay down. I stumbled to the couch and had the most intense high I’ve ever had. I couldn’t open my eyes for half an hour and was seeing shapes and colors. I hallucinated a dragon at one point. Once I could get up I got intense paranoia and texted my sister and bf that I never wanted to use again. I wish that was the last time I ever used. 

I left my weed and pipe at his house intending to not use but I got cravings and went back 2 days later to hang out and get high again. I didn’t get as high but at one point I fell on the floor uncontrollably laughing and couldn’t stop. I kept screaming at my bf to help me up but he told me I did this to myself. 

I ended up telling my parents, who I live with, that I started smoking and my mom didn’t like the idea at all. After hesitation she told me both her and dad smoked and they have my whole life. She wanted me to be discreet so she got me some smell proof bags for my equipment. I ended up not using for 2 months, don’t remember why, probably because of school. March 2018 I picked back up when I asked my Dad if I could smoke after taking some hard exams. He gave me a gram or 2 and I bought a hand held bong. I started getting extremely high a couple of times. I would binge eat and watch TV stoned out of my mind and I loved it. I started smoking throughout the day a few times and not just at night after my obligations were done. 

I stopped again until May of that year when I decided to buy off the previously mentioned friend after finals were done. This is where things started to get out of control and I got addicted. That entire summer I was hitting my bong almost everyday multiple times a day chasing those intense highs I got. I got my weed from my Dad from then on since it cost nothing and he thought it was better than buying it off the street. I started needing more than he would give me so I snuck into his shed and took a little more. My family went out of state for a week and my Dad paid me with a medium sized mason jar of his weed. Not sure how much but it was a lot. I went through the whole thing before they got back and started to steal again. 

Things were starting to get out of control. I would crave it at work and started to go home on my lunch to smoke, and then stupidly drive back, thinking I wasn’t high enough so it didn’t matter. Late summer I would start to bring it to work and smoke in my car. At this point I was trying to get a medical card, as I live in a state where that’s possible. It took a while but I was finally approved, along with my mom who has chronic pain and legitimately needs it. I thought I needed it too because of my stomach problems and anxiety and depression, and that’s what I told the doctor. Once I was able to get to the dispensary everything went downhill.

I bought my first vape in late September 2018 and went to work high. I felt amazing, as I hadn’t been really high since early summer. I would take my vape everywhere. To school, to work, you name it. I quickly built a tolerance and was only getting buzzed if lucky. I would take hits every few hours or so. I would sneak around to get my fix. I was at the dispensary at least once a week, usually more. I would get vapes, flower for when I was home and to try and make my vape last longer, and 20 5mg mint tablets. I was quickly broke and was using my whole paychecks and more to buy weed. I’m only a part time worker and was working up to 20 hours a week during school. No one knew how much I was using and spending on my addiction. They only knew I used. There are so many times I skipped class to buy weed and use it. My grades were suffering. Passing, but not great. I wanted to vape instead of study. I wanted to smoke in the shed for a hour at a time listening to music and desperately try to get high instead of being with my bf. 

November 2018 I started noticing I would hack up tar and mucus from smoking and vaping so much. It was vile and I was starting to do it constantly. I thought it was because I has a sinus infection at first but when it wouldn’t go away I knew it was more than that. It was embarrassing and gross. I kept using despite that. 

At my worst I was vaping a full gram every 3-4 days and smoking a quarter a flower a week. I managed to cut my smoking to an eight a week but I couldn’t stop vaping. Vapes were $100 per gram and flower was $40-50 per eight. I had no money ever and was sinking into a student loan account my bank opened for me years ago. My dad would have to loan me money sometimes cause I would overdraft. I would always pay him pack and paid back the account but having no money sucked. 

To save money I would steal hits of my mom’s vape and take weed from my dad. My mom didn’t know why her vapes weren’t lasting her long enough, my dad knew I was taking but didn’t say anything. I still feel like a horrible daughter for taking medication from my mom but she was understanding, but mad. 

Late May 2019 I finally admitted I had a problem and wanted to quit. I gave a letter to the dispensary since they all knew and loved me and told my family what was up. I went 3 weeks without weed but I begged my Dad one night and he caved in and gave me some. I was so happy because I was finally high after nearly a year, but I knew I fucked up. Summer 2019 was a cycle of quitting and lapsing. Withdrawing was fucking hell. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I was screaming and crying and was suicidal and I was throwing up. I had to call out of work or leave early quite a bit and they cut my hours because of it. I finally had to admit to one of my managers in July what was going on when she was borderline mad I was leaving so much. For some context, I’ve been at this job almost 3 years. I’m one of their best employees and they know this. They just had no clue I was addicted and withdrawing. My manager was glad I told her and was easier on me once she knew. 

After about a month clean I started stealing from my mom again. I was starting to crave it again and needed it constantly. I was about to go on vacation with my family and knew the withdrawal would be bad. I decided to go back to the dispensary and buy a week’s worth of vape. Thankfully it lasted me exactly a week but the day after I came home and went and bought more after telling my family I’d quit again. I vaped for another week before realizing I was gonna be broke again. I decided to quit right before going to an anime convention for 3 days knowing I would be distracted and not go through withdrawal as much. I stayed clean for about a month before stealing from my mom yet again. 

I told my mom I needed her to start hiding her vape from me, but she never hid it well enough. I would always find it. She bought a safe but didn’t use it. I was still stealing hits and she was pissed when I told her. I shouldn’t have been stealing but I told her to hide it and she didn’t. My dad bought a lock for his weed cabinet which worked. 

The stress of going back to school got to me and I bought my own vape and got high instead of reading for class. My mom caught on that I was high and took my vape. I immediately bought another one but got guilty and gave it to my friend. 

Since my mom wasn’t hiding her vape I decided I couldn’t live with her so I asked my bf’s parents if I could move in and they accepted. I lived with them for 2 months while I was recovering. I also decided to withdraw from all my classes and take a semester break to focus on recovering. 

My bf took my debit and student loan card so I couldn’t go back to the dispensary before my card expired. It expired September 2019 so after that I could never go back unless I wanted to fork up $200. The last time I went was early September and I lied to my boyfriend saying my credit card didn’t work and needed to get gas. He gave it to me and I sped to the dispensary before they closed. I bought a very high strain vape and got high instead of studying. I told his parents I wouldn’t use in their house but I walked right upstairs and got high. 

The next morning I had to work and even though I told myself I wouldn’t get high until after my shift. I took 2 full hits and after realizing I couldn’t function I told my bf the truth and he was pissed. He took my vape and hid it where I couldn’t reach. I started to freak out over how high I was. The worst thing happened short after. I had a psychotic reaction to the high strain and amount I used. I felt like I was out of reality and couldn’t feel my mouth move when talking. My vision was distorted and I felt like I was going crazy. My bf said I started screaming and hitting him for 2 minutes but I remember moaning and tapping him. I remember saying I was sorry for everything that made this moment happen. When I came back from whatever world I was in I felt like I was broken. I vowed never to touch weed again. My bf called out of work for me and I went back to bed for 6 hours. 

I took a 3 week break from work while I enrolled myself into an outpatient program. I go to weekly group meetings with drug screenings. Things started getting better. I started saving my money and paying off my credit cards, I was working up to 40 hours a week when I went back. I moved back home when my cravings were manageable. I was clean for 3 months, which is the longest time clean since May 2018. 

Christmas night I had a breakdown and begged my Dad for weed as I had cravings for days. He didn’t cave in this time and just hugged me while I cried. 

I relapsed a few days later when my neighbor, a heavy weed smoker, went on vacation and my mom and I were in charge of taking care of their cats. My mom let it slip there was weed and I immediately snuck in late at night to go find it. I took 2 small hits and had another small psychotic reaction. I had auditory hallucinations that were gibberish but freaked me out. I felt myself almost having the same reaction as last time but not quite. I had to call my mom to get me and she was mad. I called my bf to be with me while I rode out the high and he was mad too. I got no sleep that night and had to leave work early cause I was so tired. I told my manager what happened and they understood. 

I took a small hit for the last time 6 days later and didn’t get high but was very paranoid. Again, very bad sleep. I plan on telling my neighbor what I did even though my mom said she wouldn't tell. 

I have been clean for over a month now. My cravings have been almost nonexistent since I decided to start going to the gym! I want to lose weight and now working out is my new high. I feel great and feel like I accomplished something. I’m also back in school and set to graduate in December! I’m excited for my classes since 2 of them are subjects I’m passionate about. I’m set on not using while in school. I never want to use again but I still get lingering thoughts and dreams about using. I feel horrible about all the times I stole and how much money and time I wasted. I want to better myself and I hope I can succeed!

I was wondering if anyone here has had experience with anxiety/panic-attacks/hyperventilation as withdrawal symptoms. I recently decided to quit weed after daily (mediocre to heavy) use for 7+ years (I am 27 years old now). Today (day 7 after quitting)  I've had my first full blown panic attack accompanied by hyperventilation. It was the first time I've had such an attack and because I genuinly felt like everything would end for me right there I called an ambulance to take me to the hospital. After tests of heart/lungs/blood etc everything was found to be perfectly fine but I still feel like the panicky feeling/anxiety is still in there and it might happen again. Has anyone had these withdrawal symptoms and if so how much time did it take for them to go away & do you have any tips that could help me get through this period (I am looking into breathing exercises too at the moment).

I saw a doctor 3 days after and they sent me to the ER again and got more blood drawn. Finally a week later my doctor ordered 4 more blood tests, individually drawn and at the same time. All the while I kept feeling worse and worse, mainly dizzyness and head-fog. They finally simply said my B12 was low and I should take supplements, which I started on 1000mcg. It's been 3 days of taking them and I just keep feeling worse. Now I feel breathless on top of the dizzyness and brain-fog, like I can't get enough oxygen. 

This is really the only thing it could be, they've ruled basically everything else out, the symptoms exactly match, and my family has no history of weird illness. I'd like to hear anyone else's stories if they had a similar experience, because ATM I'm basically required to remain stationary and all I want to do is have some weed to help deal with the symptoms and make this inactivity bearable.",4
2020-02-16 15:02:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f4w8cw/hello_everyone/,Hello Everyone,"My name is Sarah and I recently quit smoking weed cold turkey after smoking for over 7 years.  I started using when I was 14, and my addiction progressed until I was spending over $120 per week on marijuana.  I would smoke over 6 times a day sometimes, and thought I could do everything high.  In reality, I lost about 30 lbs because I developed a sensitivity to weed.  If I didn't wake up and immediately smoke, I would throw up.  If I ate food and didn't smoke before eating, I would throw up as well.  If I didn't smoke for a day, I would also develop flu-like symptoms, such as getting the cold sweats, shaking, and feeling feverish.  I got to the point where I could count all of my ribs, but I still couldn't quit.

It took me two more years of this to finally quit, and it is the hardest thing I have ever done.  I haven't smoked in over 2 months :).  There is not a day that goes by where I do not feel strong urges to smoke.  I have to stay abstinent because I am going to be graduating college soon to become a teacher.  I want to be a good example for my students and not have to worry about random drug tests.  I think I made the right decision because my thoughts are clearer, I feel in control of myself, and I am saving so much money.  

I still am really struggling though, so any tips would be appreciated.  I think I just miss the action of smoking and feeling the smoke go in and out of my lungs.  I was doing the disposable puff bars for a while, but those are even worse for my lungs so I threw it away today.  Maybe I just need something in my mouth?  I'm not sure.  Thank you for reading :)",3

2020-02-16 09:43:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f4ri9c/the_weed_routine/,The Weed Routine," Weed works its way into people’s lives in different ways. Take this example:

*Here’s how my life has gone for the past 7 years. Get home as quickly as possible. Light up a bowl soon after I walk in the door to get high. Pet the dog, feed him, then walk him (after I’ve taken a few more hits, and feel sufficiently high). Turn on the TV and crash. Order in, or cook something simple from the kitchen. Avoid my parent’s phone calls. Get high some more, browse my social media before falling asleep sometime after midnight. Wake up feeling agitated and get ready for work, wishing I could stay home and get high all day. Repeat.*

For this person, weed integrated itself as an essential part of their day. Weed is greedy—it’s not satisfied to take up just the time when you’re getting high. It makes you rush through your other activities, just so you can slow down and enjoy the high. Except when you look back, it’s difficult to see whether you were enjoying anything at all. 

When you’re high every day, it’s hard to be fully yourself, because you’re not your original best self - you’re your high self. Like a crappy knock-off, you’re a diminished version of yourself.

This isn’t the case for everyone, though. For some people, being high every day isn’t a reality they have to worry about. But it can still overwhelm your routine. Take this example:

*I’ve managed to stay away from weed during the weekdays since I can tell it affects me at my job. I mostly keep to it on the weekends, which is a great way to unwind after a stressful week. However, after a few weeks of this, I’ve noticed some things changing. I don’t see the people I used to meet up with for a beer. I’ll get the invite, but when I look outside and see it’s snowing, I just want to sit at home and unwind with a bowl. I used to invite my friends over - the ones who liked to smoke - but over time, and after being rejected, it’s just easier to do it on my own. My weekends are spent getting high - and although I put off working out, cleaning the house, or reading for my weekends - when I start smoking, it’s hard not to keep doing it.*

For this person, weed worked its way into their routine, even when it wasn’t a daily activity. Their weekends were built around weed; and even though this person knew that more needed to be done, weed took precedence.

It’s easy to build weed into your routine. The benefits are clear: had a rough day / week / conversation? Weed can help bring you back to happiness. Over time, it becomes the preferred method for calming down. It makes everything better: TV, music, art. Until it becomes the standard requirement for us to enjoy these activities. Soon, TV and music simply don’t have the same pizzazz without getting high first. The TV shows we enjoyed while we are high simply aren’t as funny or engaging when we watch them without weed. Art, which was a great way to exercise our creative energy, suddenly seems daunting and scary without weed.

Over time, you customize your body to expect the satisfaction that comes with weed. This is the beginning stage of addiction. Without it, you revert to irritability, anger, or boredom. It becomes easier to exist at 50% of one’s potential because weed makes you ok with being bored. Doing more becomes difficult because after weed works its way into your routine, it’s hard to remember how you go by without it.",255

I am seriously finding it sooo much easier to socialise and talk to women, because i am naturally an anxious person and i think weed honestly made this anxiety ALOT worse.

It feels good to not always be behind the 8 ball, and catching up on all this REM sleep i've been missing has been CRAZY!

2020-02-16 09:00:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f4qzv7/whats_the_point/,What’s the point?,"‏Sorry for the negativity here, but this is my first day sober after 12 years of constantly smoking. 

‏I used to smoke weed first thing when I wake up, the minute before bedtime, and throughout the whole day.  

I used the substance to help me with my social anxiety and depression and just to numb myself so I won’t have to deal with the day to day problems in my life. 

‏A week ago I was arrested for drug possession and got out on bail and now waiting for the court to call me for sentencing. I live in the middle east where the law strictly forbids marijuana use and you could easily get from a 6 months sentence to a year and maybe even more, just for carrying one gram of weed.  

‏I recently got married and she knew about my smoking habit and for the most part she’s been supportive throughout our time together. 

Now I’m trying to get sober and get my life together because I hate the fact that I’m dependent on this substance. 

However, I keep thinking about court and about them locking me away and it’s not helping. 

It’s like I’m stuck in limbo, I’m trying to commit myself to a rehab facility ( which there’s is only one here where I live ) but I can’t because the court could call me at any day and the facility will not be able to release me until a full 30 days. 

The worst part is that even the judge won’t sympathize with the situation if I got checked-in into a rehab he would just think that I’m avoiding court and will add to my sentence ( I know you might not understand that but this is how the law works here in Saudi Arabia ).

Also my wife she’s on the fence about me going to rehab because she doesn’t wanna be alone which I explained that I must get to professional help and the priority is getting sober and better. 

So the idea of committing myself into a rehab center is on hold right now until I sort my legal problems first. 

Also I got a job that I simply can’t just leave for 30 days ( Keep in mind that there is no out-patient treatment where I live ), so if I decided to go to rehab it must be after my sentencing session and that I’m going to lose my job and start over again ( which is fine, I can find another job ).

The problem is now that am home with all of this weight on my shoulders I am super depressed and the feeling of worthlessness is dominating my thoughts. 

Where do I go from here?

I don’t feel like going out, all movies and shows feels boring to me now, I feel like no matter who I talk to they could never understand what am going through ( Probably because that’s my first day without the substance ).

I don’t know if that’s a weakness or just the addictive thinking but I honestly don’t know what’s the point of everything, because when I look at others who smoke and enjoying life I wonder, how the hell did they manage to get their life together and still smoke regularly or occasionally and relax and live a good life, while I by smoking I ruined my life and now facing the consequences and must quit. ( I know a few who have been smoking for more than 30 years and they’re fine and happy ) But are they really? Because i’m not. 

Part of me wish that I didn’t get arrested so I could just keep on smoking without ever feeling the need to stop ( Again it’s probably the addictive mind talking ).

I badly wanna be free from this drug but at the same time I badly wanna smoke, you know what I mean? 

Hope the people in this subreddit understands what am going through. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my rambling and I hope for a sober life and I know that someday I will look back at this and reflect. 

Wish me luck to finish this nightmare of a day sober. 


Peace.",10

I was a quiet, lonely, sad little ball of agony. Now I feel independent, happy for over 50% of the time, undertake stuff and face my fears and problems!

When I stopped smoking I realised I was doing it to hide from my problems. So I try to face them head on now. Boredom, loneliness and moodswings. I try to visit friends or family a least once a week and at first it took effort and courage, but now it has become easier and without realising it I sometimes see people 3 or 4 times a week! I try to eat well, lower my stress levels, try not be so hard on myself all the time and allow myself to make mistakes. That’s a tough one because I push myself hard without realising it. So I have to be conscious of it and give myself some slack. 

Also I need to add more fun to my life. And I’ve realised that I don’t want to be dependant on my SO or friends to have fun. So this week I will be going to the movies by myself And I will visit a museum I’ve wanted to go to by myself. It a little scary, but I am going to try it out!

Kinda silly as I never truly got to detox, and just switched one habit to another...and shatter was way worse on my lungs. This time decided to try something new, self hypnosis! I am a strong believe in hypnosis because I was able to beat a driving phobia by listening to a hypnosis video every night for a month. I went from being terrified to drive, like a feeling of life or death when I had to drive... To getting my license and now I adore driving! If I could beat that phobia, and it was a BIG one, I feel that hypnosis just may be the key to hacking my mind, and beating this weed addiction once and for all! Also gave up alcohol over 2 years ago (3years in July!) So damn it I can do this too!!! If anyone else is curious look up hypnosis to quit weed/cannabis on YouTube and give it a try. The more often you listen, the more you start to believe, we are free! We are stronger than we know. We can do this! Can't believe it's day 9, cold turkey! Ive been smoking daily for 20 freaking years people! I'm sure I'll miss it but damn I'm feeling better already and so proud of myself!

During the first week I could barely eat and I had to train very very hard in the gym so I can sleep at night .

However after the first week , it was smooth sailing. My breathing got SO much better , my
Mood was slowly starting to stabilise , and I felt connected with the world again , I was present in the moments of my life again if that makes sense.

I had my first j at 12, started smoking fairly regularly at 16 and daily at 20. 12 years later, with pile of anxiety (not caused by smoking but exacerbated) and depression, I finally quit. The first few weeks were rough but i got through it. I don't crave it anymore, I'm not tempted, I don't want to smoke it. For the first time in my adult life I can get out of bed no problem. I've finally taken control of my mental health and life is good!

I've come to realise that I have replaced weed with eating. Mostly junk food. I've put on a lot of weight and its starting to really have an impact. I stuff myself to bursting. I used to struggle, mostly due to anxiety, to finish a meal. Now I order a large and finish it, wanting more. I'm always hungry, I do think its mostly psychological. I'm bigger than I have ever been and its had a detrimental effect on my self esteem, something I have only recently started to build up.

For years I would wake up and take a couple dabs first thing in the morning and continue throughout the day every chance I get. 

About a year ago, I quit dabbing and just started smoking flower. This was incredibly difficult and created its own withdrawal symptoms as regular weed would not get me high. For the past year I’ve smoked flower all day but no longer felt like it got me high at all, it just helped me maintain my appetite, help me sleep and prevent me from being a type A impatient wreck. 

I’m transitioning to a new career and leaving my job so I decided to take a vacation with the primary purpose of quitting weed for good. The funny thing is, I’ve been so busy and having so much fun that the withdrawal has been very minimal. I have Some night sweating and a reduced appetite for the first week, and now all I notice is vivid dreams and the rest has been incredibly positive. I have better energy, memory, much less social anxiety, a huge appetite, I hold on to negative thoughts much less and am able to be more mindful of the present moment. 

In the past when I have tried to quit the physical and emotional withdrawal has been unbearable. I think this is a testament to the power of distraction and how the withdrawal is largely a mental event that has physical implications. 

Now I just worry when I get back and when the monotony of everyday life takes a hold of me. Hoping I can stay strong and not let the pink cloud lure me into thinking I can be an “occasional” smoker.

I first smoked pot when I was in 7th grade going into eighth grade over the summer and didn’t even get high. It wasn’t until months later I got absolutely blasted off of my friends homemade water bottle bong and started smoking 1-4 times per month in eighth grade.

Freshman year of high school I began using weed alone which was very fun and enjoyable but after a year of smoking about 1-5 times per week it started getting excessive. Sophomore year rolls around(no pun intended) and my friends were lazy stoners basically turning me into one also. I smoked virtually every day and when I didn’t, I just didn’t feel right.

Fast forward to junior year and I’ve smoked every single day this year since September only taking a few days off max. It has got to the point where I know I am addicted to weed but I literally have 18 grams chilling in a mason jar outside waiting to be smoked and at this point I have zero self control. I don’t want to see or talk to someone about it because if I do that I’ll probably be forced into a worse situation so right now I’m kind of at a crossroads.

Yesterday was valentines day so we' smoked the rest of our stash up as a final farewell. (I didn't want it in the house anymore, and couldn't face to throw it away)

I have spent my teenage years smoking and surrounded by people who smoke, from my best friend - to my parents. I've got out the habit of doing my hobbies - instead choosing to sit on the sofa and smoke up whilst I drain the bank account and let the house get dirty, but no longer.

I'm scared, I don't know who I am without weed, but I'm excited to find out.I was a social smoker in college, only smoking with friends, but after a close friend committed suicide I started smoking by myself, barely passed college and made no future plans. - It didn't help that my mum was always able to supply me.It started out as helpful - after smoking up my thoughts would calm and I would be able to get on with my day instead of obsessing over whatever my brain wanted me to obsess over, but over the years the dynamic has changed, weed has gone from being that comfy friend that makes me feel good, to an abusive partner that makes me feel guilty, lazy and unmotivated. I'm not sure when the change happened, but by the time I realised it, it was too late. It's time to undo the last 7 years, to find myself and get back on track.

I'm starting Uni in September and I don't want to make the mistakes I was making at college, 5 years ago. I want to be healthier, happier and more social. It's been a long time coming and I'm finally ready.  My box and grinder are tucked away in a dark corner (I don't want to throw them because they're sentimental to me - they were presents, and I might end up using the box for jewelry one day, when I can have it in the house and not associate it with weed.)

That means for almost half my life I’ve been stoned. I started smoking daily after trying to suppress a memory of being raped while passed out from alcohol that was supplied by the same older guy who raped me on my senior week. It took me ELEVEN years for that memory to bubble up, and by that time I’d gained 75 lbs and a loser abusive boyfriend who did wonderful things like try to suffocate me with a pillow while I slept. 

I’ve used the pot to deal with the depression and anxiety and to be able to sleep for 17 years now. 

My dad is a huge stoner so it’s not only always available but it’s basically pushed upon me. My mom even weaned off opioids a few years ago and is a huge stoner as well. My brother smokes, and so do most of my close friends. My life and personality are very entangled with the substance but I know it’s no longer serving my highest self (pun intended bc I gotta have a sense of humor about this!)

I know some of my friends will support me either way and thankfully my fiancé cannot smoke for work. I want to quit and get clean so we can start a family soon. 

I think I finally have a good support system in place to successfully do this. I lost 70 lbs using internet and in person accountability so I’m starting to learn what works for me. I have a therapist now and a prescription for an antidepressant. I’m also doing a ton of yoga and am training to teach and I feel like it’s been a huge catalyst for this. 

I “quit” for about 4-5 months last year after a 3 week out of country vacation where I didn’t bring any (don’t be too proud I still spent 3-4 of those days stoned off my ass in Amsterdam).  Even during that time I was hitting the pen sporadically and having edibles to sleep. 

Today is day one of no smoking. I’ll allow edibles to help me sleep and ease the nightmares that I know will be coming until my jar of Nutella runs out, but after that it’s time to learn to get to know the sober me. 

If anyone wants to be accountability partners I am so in! Or if you just want to just check in on me I appreciate it! I’ve told a lot of people in real life my plan as well to up my chance of success.

Over christmas, in the last death throes of my addiction I was compulsively smoking as much as I could, threw away the last of the bag, bought again and so on. I was smoking so much but I wasn’t even getting high anymore. I was in a perpetual fog and smoking that spliff was only a slight ease of the restlesness I felt while sober, caused by a desire to actually live life.

YouTube doesn’t give me anything anymore, video games doesn’t give me anything anymorw and weed certainly doesn’t either.
I feel as though I’ve been in a real lazy mode for my whole life and now at 29 it’s quite hard to turn it around and start taking responsibility.
I really want to though and I have no other choice if I want to be happy and enjoy life.
Finding happiness in the simple every day is harder than it sounds, but I will start small.

Yesterday a familiar thought popped in my head. «It’s been a long time since you smoked now, why not just have one and feel that high again?» - «Maybe it’s gonna be good like the first times now?»
They are all bullshit. Smoking a joint now would probably give me that intense feeling, slight paranoia but excitement following it, but then 2 hours later I’d still be on the couch going nowhere.

How's everyone feeling today?  


I'm just stopping by to keep myself on track and share a bit of my experience over the last few days.

&#x200B;

As expected the first 24 hours were by far the hardest, however, the momentum you can create from getting through that is quite significant. 

&#x200B;

People have already noticed a change in my personality, so it isn't just a placebo. They've said I seem more present in the moment, more alert and overall happier which aligns with how I'm feeling.

&#x200B;

Some little things that have helped me that my also help you;

In general; Excerise, Eating Healthy, Spending time with friends, Drinking water, 

Specifically; Taking the time to think about how marijuana is serving you, how dopamine affects your brain and sitting with the feeling when you get a craving. More than likely if you're feeling the urge to smoke something else is going on. If you don't understand what just yet that's okay. If you're just starting on this path you can journal when you get cravings to help you figure it out, write down when and why/what feelings come to you when you get the urge. You may be able to realize a pattern. 

&#x200B;

*P.S. I wasn't sure how to include this, but I'd also like to recommend a book called Atomic Habits to everyone. It's a general book about how habits can affect you and how to build or break them. Many topics in this book run parallel with my personal struggle with addiction/habits.*",10

My girlfriend and I have been living together for about 5 months, and at first we just had a little bubbler, but we quickly wound up buying several bongs/paraphernalia and constantly smoking, needless to say marijuana does anything except help with communication, which is important in healthy relationships... Especially new ones. I have had several relationships end with marijuana to thank, and I ended up quitting for some amount of time after each one. 
Recently I've been pushing my family and some friends away, which has caused a number of breakdowns.
Yesterday was day 1 of no smoke. We went to bed at about 7:30, and I woke up soaked in sweat two hours later, and she's been suffering loss of appetite and insomnia. 

Idk what to do with my old stuff, but we wanna get this behind us ASAP.

2020-02-14 18:47:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f4128d/my_story/,My story,"Hi, I thought I may as well share my story, as I've been pretty active in this sub the past few days.

I think the best way to go about this is just from start to finish, chronologically. If you only want to read about my recovery and think that reading about the ""stoner"" part of my story may be a bad idea because it contains a lot of stories about smoking, you can scroll down and I will mark the part where I get to my recovery in all caps. I'd also like to warn you this post is gonna be very long and I'm gonna ramble a lot, so be warned.

I first got curious about weed around the end of 8th grade. I had a friend who told me about it and I asked him to buy some for me, because I wanted to try it. He came over for a sleepover at some point with a couple of joints, and we snuck out to smoke. He actually didn't smoke his, just walked with me while I smoked. I got through about half of the joint before coughing really hard and suddenly getting really high. I almost felt sick, and it was hard to get back to the house, because I was so dizzy. I remember slurring my words and thinking ""wow this is so cool, I'm so fucked up."" I hid in the bathroom for pretty much the rest of my high, because I was scared my dad would come downstairs and I would get in trouble. I spent that time alternating between masturbating, listening to the Beatles, and lying down on the floor with all the lights off. This experience started my unhealthy relationship with weed, as I wanted to use it for purely recreational use, and had no interest in self-discovery or meditation or anything even remotely useful. I just wanted to use it for fun.

Over that summer, I enjoyed the ""honey-moon"""" phase I had with this drug. I didn't crave it, I felt fine without it, using it was the best thing in the world, and I felt like a discovered a whole new part of life that made it ten times better. In all honesty, I had a completely healthy relationship with weed during that summer. However, that planted the seeds for the addiction I would face during my freshman year of high school. 

When I went back to school for high school, I didn't really know who to make friends with if I wanted to smoke, because the guy who introduced me to it went to a different school, and my plug was a grade below me. I spent the first couple weeks or so of school almost entirely sober, and I got so bored from it that I drank some alcohol just to feel inebriated. This was my first experience with alcohol, and I think it was a significant moment for me. It showed that I couldn't go without drugs for a sustained period of time. I hated the flavor of alcohol and the high was far inferior to weed, but it was better than nothing in my eyes. Eventually, I found the right people to hang out with at school, and started smoking at least once a week, at a bare minimum. 

As the days went by, I found myself smoking more and more often.I was spending all of my money on carts/wax pens/cartis, following whoever had a cart around at school, and just prioritizing weed over everything else. I even lost some of my closest friends for a while, because they didn't like the person I was while I was high. I barely even remember this point, because I basically got to a point where I would just get baked s fuck every day, take a nap, repeat. I didn't understand how other people could get through the day without a smoke. I justified it to myself with my good grades, thinking that if my grades were good, it wasn't really affecting me. My whole identity at that point revolved around me being a stoner, and I was proud of it. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was also depressed. I didn't recognize it as depression, because for it manifests as a dysthymia, which is a form of depression that makes you feel more dull than depressed. Instead of feeling sad, I just felt numb all the time. Nothing really made me happy or sad, I was just an emotional wall. Weed was the one thing that made me feel something (euphoria). However, this merely fed my depression, because my brain was used to this unnatural amount of dopamine, and without it I just felt nothing.

This all came to a head in December, which I have no recollection of the first three weeks of. I remember specifically being proud of smoking for something like 23 or 24 days straight, I don't remember the exact number. My family was going on a trip to see my Grandma in Texas for Christmas, and I brought my wax pen. However, I got paranoid when we were about to cross a state border, so I dropped the thc cartridge out the window about a hundred feet away from the border, right out of the car window. I was high as fuck so if that sounded like a really dumb course of events, it was. I felt like shit and was super irritable for the rest of trip because I started to suffer the withdrawal effects of weed. I couldn't sleep, when I did sleep I couldn't get up, I couldn't eat, I was angry, and I just wanted to smoke. 

When we got home, I had a sleepover with a stoner buddy of mine, and I did psilocybin mushrooms for the first time. I don't remember it all that well, but I remember enjoying it quite a bit. A couple days later, my family went over to my Uncle's house to celebrate late Christmas, because we had been in Texas during actual Christmas. I got a hundred dollar bill from my Grandma (not the one we visited in Texas), and immediately went to the bathroom to text my plug that I wanted to buy. I texted my mom I wanted to go soon under the shitty excuse that I wanted to ""hang out"" with my friend. We stayed there for a while longer, and I got super mad at my parents and told them I would barely be able to hang out with my friend now. They dropped me off at the park where I said I was meeting him, and I spent all of the money I got for Christmas on weed. I got high, and then went over to the house of one of my other stoner buddies. We hung out for a bit, and when I got home, my parents sat me down on the couch, and told me they knew I was smoking. They explained that they had suspected me for a while, and then they knew for sure when my sister told them (I had told her about me being a stoner during the Texas trip). 

The next month was a very strange one. I still had some of the mushrooms in my room from earlier, and I didn't tell my parents about them. I had them the next night. That was the last time I did drugs for a considerable time.

RECOVERY SECTION STARTS HERE

After getting caught, my parents decided to keep me home from school for the rest of the semester, because they knew I would smoke if I went back to school. I did all of my schoolwork from home, and was basically grounded for the whole month. My parents also switched me to a different school, to give me a fresh start, as well as enrolling me in a youth sobriety group (think AA or MA but it's a bunch of kids who for the most part don't want to be there but are only there because their parents forced them to). During that month, I realized that life was a lot better without weed. I started to feel emotion again, I went back to talking to the friends I had lost during my addiction, and just felt way better physically and mentally. Most of the kids in this group didn't care about staying sober, but I did. I made a lot of realizations from this group, and I think it was big factor in me caring about my sobriety. Talking to people every week who were trying to stay sober, even if it was just for their parents, was really helpful, because it was one of the only parts of my life that took place in an environment full of people who weren't always smoking weed. I was also able to see the perspective of other people, and see how they dealt with it, as well as give advice and think about addiction from many angles.

On the other side of things, school was kinda weird. I didn't find a good group of friends to hang out with until November of last year (currently in sophomore year of high school), and it took me a long time to find my identity without weed, which is something I see on here a lot. At first I went through a phase of hanging out with some really boring and annoying people that I didn't even enjoy being around, and I couldn't really tell that I didn't like being friends with them, because the euphoria of January had worn off and I just went back to being depressed. I stopped hanging out with them eventually, and started hanging out with some other friends that were a bit better, but still had nothing in common with me. This cycle continued for a while, up until a few months ago. During the slightly less than a year that I spent being depressed while sober, the only real reason I think I stayed sober was because I was getting drug tested by my parents. I think if I had no fear I of consequences, I definitely would have smoked. In fact, I even hit someone's juul a few months in, because I knew nicotine wouldn't show up on a drug test. I also almost bought LSD in November (like 11 months into sobriety), because I knew that wouldn't show up either. The only reason I didn't end up buying it was because I was scared of getting fake LSD and I didn't have a way to get a test kit. This is why I have so much respect for everyone who manages to stay sober on their own, because I definitely wouldn't have. Even though I knew that being sober was the best thing for me, and I wanted to stay sober, without that weekly drug check, I'm sure I would have slipped up on a bad day.

The real turnaround was when I started hanging out with friends that I really enjoyed being around. I didn't feel the need to smoke, because my sense of happiness was finally there. Additionally, This semester I've started taking some college classes (my school is only M W F, so on Tuesdays and Thursdays I can take college classes), and I've really enjoyed them, and they've kept me busy. Smoking weed doesn't even sound fun anymore, because I'm busy doing more important things and living my best life. On top of that, I've also started drawing as of late, which helps me channel my creative outlet. I can finally confidently say that I don't want to do weed in any capacity anymore. I won't get too cavalier with this attitude, because we all have bad weeks, but in my current state, there is no room for weed in my life. I'm really grateful to my parents for being so helpful in all of this, because I honest to god couldn't and wouldn't have done it without them. 

What I've learned from this whole experience is a lot of things. One of the biggest things I can say I've learned is that sobriety is a really long process, and I'm only at the beginning. I think the biggest things (at least for me) that help with sobriety are keeping myself busy, having friends that I really like to be around, and doing things that are fulfilling. The most dangerous state I can be in is one where I feel bored, have no one to talk to, and just feel like everything is pointless. In this scenario, I just want to smoke weed to take away the pain. With my current situation, I don't even worry about it, because my life is so full of amazing things that smoking weed just sounds silly and pointless.

Sorry for kinda just rambling on for 11,000+ words, I hope you got something out of this. If you have any questions or want me to clear something up, just let me know in the comments. I'll be happy to respond. Have nice day, and good luck staying sober <3",6

I was so scared taking time off work for my mental health would ruin my career that's just starting. I even felt okay that if it was a rejection call I would handle it well. 

I used casual sex and weed to escape my pain, and now I face it head on and I feel so strong and purposeful.

I know theres going to be more trying times. If I get this role I will be in a very male dominated environment, some people may even smoke to release stress. 

My parents still have there struggles, and my brother still tries me with his issues. But this year I am focused completely on me. My happiness and career is my focus, I can think about dating again when I have created a beautiful life for myself.

Quitting is the easy part. Wanting to stay sober is the hard part. Every time I do this it just doesn't feel worth it. I've been craving anything, weed alcohol opioids, you name it. If I could acquire weed, I fucking would. Immediately. I don't know how I've stayed off liquor recently- that was my main vice before weed took over. 

I just don't want to do anything besides get high. Everything is boring and stressful. I don't get how anybody motivates themselves to change. 

I have more money now and I just wish I could spend it all on weed. Sooner or later I'll have enough to see about getting a medical card somehow. That seems like a lot of work too though. But it's about the only way I could get high anymore. Most of my connections evaporated a few months ago. 

The longer I stay clean and sober the more I feel like it just isn't fucking worth it. Not if I'm not gonna change my entire goddamn life to be better than it was when I had intoxicants. And I'm pretty sure I'm not. I have just zero motivation. I wish I could just sleep forever. Wake up when there's drugs for me.

I know I'm depressed. I'm on medication for it. Doesn't do much. Was in therapy for a few years but had to quit because money and also it felt like a waste of time. All that money I could've just spent on weed, lol. Feels like it would've been a better investment. 

I fucking hate being sober. Just fucking hate it. I don't know how I do it. Day goddamn 5. Fuck everything. Gonna scrape resin even though I know there absolutely isn't any more resin.

Sooo, I don't know if anyone else follows particular people's journeys here (I do, for inspiration / hope / whatever) so here's a recap of mine for those who don't.

I decided to quit about ten days ago. Had a relapse straight away cos with hindsight, I don't think I was mentally ready straight away, but regardless, got back to it right after. Then after a tough few days of internal debate as to whether I COULD do it, I managed to get to day 4 (which was something I didn't think I could do) before relapsing again. Then, as is the way with this drug, once I'd let the voice of evil back in it got me again twice more. 

So in short, in the last 8 days I've smoked 3 times, none of which were a binge and ALL due to exhaustion of either the body or the mind.

Anyways, here I am now, 48 hours clear feeling a lot better than I did at this exact milestone nearly a week ago. Whether it's cos I've turned a corner mentally or by smoking less in the last week has made the difference I don't know but it feels better this time. I'm eating this time which makes such a difference. I haven't vomited for at least 5 days. This is such a big thing for me.

I guess what I want to put across from my journey to anyone reading or following it is that sometimes relapses happen, and please avoid them if you can, but this time cos I can vividly remember how bad I felt last week I don't want to go there again. I'm done. If I relapse I'm just gonna keep going with my recovery anyways so really, I may as well not do it to myself. I don't hate myself anymore, why be hateful to myself making myself ill?

That voice that says ""one more won't hurt"" is lying to us all and I'm done with this abusive relationship. I never planned to become a drug addict but I do plan to stop being one.

As ever, good luck everyone, stay strong ❤️",24

But I’ve had a cough for like a year that won’t go away, my lungs need a break so bad.

My problem - and where I’m hoping you all can help - is just my lungs alone (yes I realize how dumb that sounds) isn’t enough to motivate me to stop. I can go a full day, but by bed time I have the itch and away I go with a joint. 

I have ADD and weed helped me get through school and still helps me focus. I don’t feel a loss of motivation when I smoke, if anything it makes me more active somehow. I get high and become productive. 

I used to smoke cigarettes too until last April (started those before the weed, age 13), and found it actually pretty easy to quit once I decided/it became clear to me that cigarettes didn’t in any way help me. They did literally nothing for me. There was no reason to keep smoking them, and therefore really easy to stop doing it. 

But with weed it’s different for me.

2020-02-14 12:45:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f3vqsj/starting_to_make_the_right_decisions/,Starting to make the right decisions.,"I gave up weed Sunday night for several reasons. It is now Friday. I am not struggling but wanted to put my story out there to help others and document the benefits of quitting. 

1. I had been smoking terrible weed for almost two weeks. I used to buy a LB and then pass the savings on to all of my friends. So when I got a LB of shitty weed it wasn’t just me that was upset. Hearing all the complaints was irritating but understandable. However the idea of coming up with Thousands of dollars to help all of these ungrateful people frustrated me in a way that I decided not to do that anymore. 

2. I wasn’t going to give the guy who sold me the dirty, seedy, leafy, and potent less weed another dollar. This all meant I was in the business of being a customer again. I wasn’t willing to pay customer prices or go through the troubles of contacting a dealer and obtaining weed again. All with the possibility of getting screwed again. This definitely wasn’t the first time a dealer got one over on me, this was just the worst.

3. I have been smoking weed longer than I haven’t. I am turning 30 in March and started before High School. I’ve used every day since college and genuinely enjoyed the “Stoner” lifestyle. I have been struggling for several years with that decision. I just hate how complacent it makes me. I hate the idea of sitting here treading water and never progressing in life. Weed makes me perfectly happy doing nothing. In fact that is what I used it for. To fill voids, so when I was bored all I had to do was smoke and now just sitting there staring mindlessly at some form of entertainment was perfectly fine. That is what I want to change the most. 

4. I only include this because it was my trigger. Something happened that Sunday Night that made me realize I wasn’t happy and drastic changes needed to be made. Specifically what happened I don’t want to go into. Essentially though someone I considered a friend went out of their way to take advantage of me and was completely unapologetic when confronted. They knew what they had done. This sent me into depression. The kind where “all of this shit is pointless, why even bother” and “I hate my life”. I was SO MAD though that I decided to do something instead of mope. Make Changes.

Here we are it’s only been 5 days but I haven’t even the inclination to smoke. My roommate smokes and there is still paraphernalia and crumblings all over my apartment. I still have an oz of the shitty weed. Still nothing. Something clicked that night and I was just done. Seriously, I’m over it. Just this whole disdain for all the decisions I made the last 8 or 9 years. I can and will be better. 
I’ve made some other drastic changes in my diet and health but those had begun before I quit smoking. I am thankful to find this community and will continue to post updates on the benefits I find the longer I stay sober. Good luck to you all. You Got This!!",6

I remember stumbling upon this sub a few years ago and putting it in my back pocket for a more opportune time.

I've been wanting to quit for a couple months but I live with chronic back pain from a fall and have used that as an excuse to continue smoking for as long as a could manage. I'm very functional while high and so I never saw a problem with my behavior in the past. But now I see how much it zaps my motivation, how it affects my sleep and how rested I feel in the morning, how beholden I feel to the habit of rolling and smoking. How it doesn't feel the same when you do it everyday and it just becomes a drain to your energy and bank account.

The only thing is I have put on weight and quite a bit, about 8- 10 kgs which I don't understand because I am being more active and eating better. I'm super stressed about it because I'm getting married this year and I am worried I won't fit my dress. I used to be super skinny when I was smoking and that's when I got the dress. 

Has anyone experienced this? Does anyone have any tips ? It would be mucho appreciated!

2020-02-14 04:20:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f3prkl/finally/,Finally?,"I have posted to this group before about trying to quit weed, but quitting never took. Each and every time I tried, even if I could get a week out, I felt like absolute trash and couldn't manage for long. I spiraled into depression and wound up smoking more weed than ever before... wash rinse and repeat. 

Well this time I was determined not to try again unless I had help. I mentioned how hard it was to stay sober and my therapist suggested AA but for several reasons I didn't want to go to AA. She asked me my symptoms and I once I told her she told me that it was a panic attack.  

Now keep in mind I didn't know I suffered from panic attacks.  I knew I had anxiety but the sudden rush of emotions, the sudden immediate tiredness, heart racing , sweating... these are all apparently common panic attack signals. I never knew that's what they were. I thought panic attacks were something different and that my sudden tiredness meant they weren't panic attacks but indeed sudden extreme tiredness can be a sign. 

So now I've been able to put a word to the emotions I feel when I abstain from the weed that goes beyond general anxiety. 

I went to speak to a psychiatrist and after much back and forth - really he was kind of a jackass about it - he prescribed me Hydroxyzine. A tiny tiny tablet, no more than two a day, and only when necessary. 

Well, cut to a few days ago I'm 3 days off weed and I got my first panic attack post weed while I was at work. My coworkers noticed the sudden change in my demeanor. I took 1 tab and set my alarm for 20 minutes, which is a good interval to see if you can notice any effects. And low and behold, it worked. 

My panic attack faded much quicker than normal. I still felt exhausted from the attack but I didn't need to go home from work, I was able to take a break and come back to my duties. When I got home that night I fell right asleep. 

Since then I have had 1 additional panic attack and the same thing: took 1 hydroxyzine, waited only a few minutes and felt the panic subside. 

I still feel spacey, odd that I'm not smoking 24/7, a little jittery and irritable. But I'm making it thru the days. And now I'm going into my 1st full week without weed and I'm actually hopeful for my future rather than counting the seconds every day till it's totally out of my system.

I don't want to pitch everyone here a magic cure because I think that would be mean. I will post again, perhaps in a week, with my progress. But take it from me, a 20 year every day all day smoker, I'm actually hopeful of my ability to get off this damn weed for the first time in forever. 

After i get completely off weed, maybe 6 months from now, i intend to try to go on a general antianxiety med. My psychiatrist told me he wouldn't prescribe me anything while I was still on weed and I understand that... but now, for the first time in I can't tell you how long, I actually think I have a shot. 

I wish you all well. Long time lurker, occasional poster. Maybe my luck can help some of you. ❤❤",2

I'm not getting psychotic and unusual anxiety (even for 2 weeks after I stopped smoking) I'll feel VERY sensitive and everything just feels like so much.

My relationships with friends is coming back to normal :).

Like two 2 liters a day when I'm really bad, and it causes my legs to swell and I'm on blood pressure medication now. I'm still super dehydrated so I try my best to drink water, but easily crave those 2 INTENSELY)

Giving anything up, comes down to learning to deal with our emotions in healthy ways. Everyday is a learning experience! I'm just glad the 1 added reason I love not smoking cannabis as much as I used to (2-4 40mg THC brownies / day at my worse) is how much it makes me feel like SHIT. No more psychosis, no more panic attacks, no more social anxiety.... I don't need that type of negativity & lose of control in my life. 

It served it's purpose and helped me get through the worse symptoms of my depression, and now it's time to move on & enjoy my life without cannabis. Like it was intended in the first place. :)

I've been clean for a couple of weeks and somehow things are falling into place. I've set myself a ""theme-word"" for the year, that being 'proactive' and whenever I sense a fork in the road I choose the one that allows me to take action and make direction in my life. I got this idea from a YouTube video about ditching new year's resolutions for a theme-word and it's genuinely positively affected my life. 

I did a deep clean of my place and annihilated chores as if I took the pill from Limitless. Before I would have maybe just done a surface sweep of things and then called it a day but I'm no longer in the haze. I'm no longer ""weed-happy"" as I've seen people on here describe it. 

I know from experience that quitting is hard, but I've finally reached a stage in my life where I am just sick of the high - it doesn't improve my life, it just presses forward on the remote until my next hit and while I'm 'content' I'm also vacant and passive. 

Another thing that has made this a lot easier is meditating. I don't cross my legs into a pretzel or say ""ommmmm"" I just set an alarm on my clock for 10 minutes from now and do my best to unclench and unfocus. Taking deep breaths and acknowledging thoughts as passing clouds opting to put my attention towards counting or listening to my own breath, and this has made the noise in my head a lot quieter. 

There was something a guy named Simon Sinek also said that really resonated with me. It was about consistency and how things manifest through repetition. He took the example of being in love with your spouse: when you meet your spouse for the first time you don't automatically love them, but eventually there comes a point where you do - but when is that exactly? It isn't an exact moment, but rather a culmination of moments that all add up and snowball into this grand thing. Same with working out, you don't go to the gym once and see results, you stick with it and eventually, through consistency, you get in shape.

This has become a bit of a self-help styled Ted talk at this point so I'll cut it here. The point of me writing all of this out is that even someone who smoked daily for about a decade can turn the tide. I believe in you and your ability to treat yourself with compassion. Try a bunch of different things and if any of it helps keep with it.

I feel more strongly, I do more things, I treat myself better.

Electricians and Powerline technicians are 99% guaranteed to have a job after and I know I'm capable of graduating and getting the job. I work out 6 days a week, have an 87% average, eat healthily, get good sleep(only from weed). But when I don't smoke weed I'm a moody Lil bitch the whole day and just soft lil bitch in general.

what the hell am i doing.  where did the time go.  it feels like literally yesterday that it was new years eve and I was so motivated and prepared to never use this year, to get my life back.  I'm pretty sure I got high again on like January 3rd.  6 weeks later and I've been high for probably 4-5 of them.  I don't know, it's all kind of blurred together.

truthfully, i haven't been using long- didn't even try it until a year ago, and only started using it daily about 7 months ago.  i'm hanging on to these numbers because I need to believe I still have a chance to beat this before it really starts to take my life away from me, when the count starts becoming years, decades.

I never thought this would happen to me.  I was a really driven person growing up, great student, physically fit, graduated from a prestigious college, was never a party-er, but after college I was thrust into the real world and I think I felt really disappointed.  I wasn't reaching the level of success I hoped for, and it was almost entirely because of my own poor work ethic that seemed to be getting worse and worse. 

 it's now year 3 of living with my parents in bumblefuck nowhere suburbia, single, barely employed and going nowhere fast, while all my friends are off living their lives, with jobs, their own place, and significant others, some getting married later this year, the others soon to follow I'm sure.  it feels like I'm in purgatory and I think last year the feeling broke me down and I tried weed and it just made everything feel okay.  for the first time in years I just felt okay with it all, like it was all going to work out, like all my anxieties and shames and depressions just melted away in a warm hug.  its a cliche but I've been chasing that high for the better part of the past year.  

weed found me at my absolute most vulnerable, and it gave me a hug when no one else would, and it was always there at my side whenever I needed it.  but its become a monster on my back, holding me down.  it's making me okay with how shit my life is, as opposed to taking the steps necessary to actually improve it.  I don't even have big aspirations of being rich or any of that bullshit.  I just want to be independent and to feel like I'm not a complete total waste of potential, and right now weed is stopping me from getting there.

my birthday is in about a week.  I'll be 26.  I hope I can look back at this year and period in my life, and see it as the time when I did the right thing, when I hit rock bottom but found the strength to pull myself out, and was all the better for it.

Quitting for myself has made all the difference!,"I had quit two times before. Once for a job and the second time for a close friend that challenged me to quit. Both times I went roughly 4 to 5 months and then returned to my daily habit. The second time I went the longest and felt I really had a grasp of how to handle my smoking once I resumed; I could totally keep it under control I told myself. I couldn't have been more wrong! 

Started slow, smoking one hit off a bowl a night and then the use crept up slowly but surely until I was back to multiple bowls a day habit. And I never experienced all the positive benefits people here mention on both of those times I quit. Mental clarity was about it. 

But as cliche as it is to say the third time really was the charm. And that's mainly because I did it for myself and only myself. I had just gotten to a breaking point where I was constantly staying at my house smoking the days and nights away. Smoking my life away. I knew I was over it, but I kept smoking until finally, I said enough is enough. Smoked until I ran out, got rid of my pipes and grinder, and didn't look back (well, a little bit here and there during the first couple of weeks). I had smoked for 17 years on the daily and was sick and tired of who I had let myself become. 

And after about a week I started noticing all the benefits of quitting people mention here all the time. My social anxiety, general anxiety, and depression were disappearing. My drive, ambition, and motivation were returning. My love of life that I thought was gone for good came rushing back. I found myself wanting to go out and be with friends. I found conversations to be a breeze, no longer did I stumble through my words and have trouble coming up with that one word I wanted to say when I wanted to say it. Phone numbers being told to me no longer sounded like a foreign language. The real difference was that I had quit exclusively for myself. It's a night and day difference between who I am now and who I was before. I even have a new job at a company I've been wanting to work with for a while. 

I owe a huge debt of gratitude to this community. Had I not stumbled upon this place I'm not sure I would have had the will to quit.

I didn't really have this planned, so my post may not be very poetic.  I just wanted to rely on you guys, if you'll allow me, to help me through what I'm about to go through.

I started smoking weed when I was 14, and was a regular user at 18.  I have spent the last 20 years high.  Yes, I finished college, yes I have a good job, I have a wife, a daughter, I exercise regularly, have a decent diet, and I appear to be a religious person (and do consider myself one) and yet, I am ALWAYS high.  I mean I smoke about every 3-4 hours.  I smoke to do everything, to have lunch, to go to the mall, to take a nap, to watch tv, to hang out with my daughter, whatever it is, I will smoke before it.

I exhibit all the typical stoner behavior: I avoid ALL (and I do mean ALL) social interactions, I am very lazy, I haven't improved in life, and I waste money like crazy.  I am constantly in a state of anxiety of, when can I get find a way to go to the dispensary on the days when they have a deal on the stuff I want to buy.  I slur my speech, I don't put together sentences well, I avoid eye contact with everyone.  Thankfully I discovered vaping, or else I wouldn't even come close to hug and kiss my own mother.

I just wanted to write this post to keep me reminded of why I want to quit.  This recent scare with the vape pens has just made me worry more and more about getting sick and leaving behind my wife and daughter confused on what happened to me.  My wife knows I vape, but she doesn't really understand it.

I just threw away all my cartridges and pens that I have with me at work and I will throw away whatever paraphernalia I have at home.  Thankfully I don't have any cartridges at home, but I do have a lot of shake and a half gram of good weed and a pipe in my car which I am having hard time throwing away.   Please keep me in your thoughts and push me to keep through this!",10

“Some men are cowards, but they fight like brave men, or get the hell beaten out of them watching men fight who are just as scared as they are. The real hero is the man who fights even though he is scared.” - George S. Patton

I’ve been in the back lines for years now, thinking that my fears are a valid reason to not fight the battle of overcoming addiction. Then I started lurking on here, and got the hell beaten out of me reading about people who are pushing onwards through every circumstance imaginable.

Every act of courage has helped me, imperceptibly, as “gradually as the tide lifts a grounded ship.” Today, it is time for me to throw away my vape pen and join all of you in the thick of it. God bless all of you for making a real positive difference in the world. At the very least, in my world. Any support is greatly appreciated.

Im managing to cut down, but that smoke after work is absolutely killing me, i cant not smoke it

But if i have a smoke, i can't go home, my parents will smell it, they would fly off the handle, so i stay out with friends all night, which inevitably leads to more smoking

I used to smoke about 6 a day, and now its just that 1 i really cant kick

I started smoking a few years ago due to my sister getting me into it. It was fun at first, and fun for a long time after that, but like a silent killer I didn't realize what it was leading to or how it would affect me long term.

I've been lurking the sub since day 1 and all of the posts about becoming stagnant, suppressing emotional growth, physical growth, etc. really resonate with me. It turned me into someone who went to weed only so that I didn't have to deal with my emotions. It supported my binge eating, it convinced me that exercise was not needed.

And yes, plenty of people smoke and run, eat right, etc. but I started smoking in a time in my life where all it did was convince me weed was the solution to all my problems. Not going to therapy, getting on antidepressants if I needed them, not eating right and physical exercise.

The only time I grew as a person was when I couldn't smoke, due to financial reasons. But of course as soon as I could afford it I went ham. Weed bought every week, snack nights and cartoons 3 nights a week, bought myself pipes, bubblers, even a dab rig, etc.

Now it's pretty much all going in the trash. I feel empathetic towards others who have a lot of urges to smoke after quitting, but for me personally I've felt the effects for too long to have any sort of urge left. It led me into a deep depression for the last two months, and I thought if I just smoked every day I would be okay. I wanted to kill myself and the only times I didn't was when I was smoked, so *of course* it was the solution. Despite the fact that I could barely face my emotions and resorted to self-harm because I just couldn't handle them.

Since quitting, oh my god, I feel like a different person. I had been slowly tapering it off for the last month or so, but every time I'd smoke I'd become depressed again, and I didn't notice the pattern until maybe a week ago. I am seeing a new therapist soon, I'm eating right, going on walks, and life feels worth living again. Also my emotions have been easier to handle, the longer I've gone without weed.

Don't succumb to the short term pleasure, weed will keep you slow, half-dead, unmotivated, and at the end of the day you will have to face your problems, and you can't just keep smoking them away, they *will* catch up to you.

Thanks for listening. I know not everyone will relate to this, but I hope it helps someone who does.",33

I go by Ty, and I’ve been weed-free for a little over a year now. My situation is a bit different than some of you warriors out there, because I was forced to quit due to probation and drug testing. 

However, two weeks into my sober journey I decided to try to smoke weed again just to say one last goodbye, and it was a horrible experience. Insane paranoia, exhaustion set in, and not to mention I ate an entire pizza to myself (NOT healthy at all). The stuff that’s out there now is wild, and due to that experience I came to the conclusion of “What’s the point?”

It’s been over one year now, and I have never slipped and tried to get high. For those of you battling this without the consequence of going to jail, I’m here to tell you it’s possible. At first you will feel on top of the world due to natural amounts of dopamine being released into your brain. But be careful because around the 90-120 day mark you will begin to feel that dwindle; your brain will balance out to the proper amount of chemicals that is needed. You MUST find a hobby that you enjoy - working out is the most popular one. 

Good luck everyone and if anyone has any questions feel free to answer. I believe in all of you.

But in the last year and a half things have just been constantly shit and i am smoking excessively (to the point i am frequently ill) in silly ways (homemade gbongs and such) in September last year i went to Hospital for 5 days due to breathing difficulties and such and was given a course of medication. After 3-4 weeks i recovered but i was still on my old habits then, ever since coming back from hospital i have maintained a sinilar habit but have cut down significantly since new years to about 5g a week from an ounce a week.

But i have had 2 more chest infections or similar since then where i struggle to breathe. Lose my breathe have some slight chest irritation lots of brown phlemmy coughs and wheezing. It happened again in end of October just shy of a month after my first recovery and again iy struck mid Jan and i got over the worst about a week and a half ago but i cannot quit. I manage 3-4 days and feel the slight progression of my thtost and lungs getting better but then i relapse back into binge smoking again (but i cut out making silly gbongs and such just use glass now)

Its basically ruining my life. I struggle to breathe and im in constantly irritable mood, i havent been clean from weed for over a week in years but i find i am so depressed if i dont. Although now im bursting into tears randonly even when stoned.

Anyone had any experience like this or going cold Turkey? I dont smoke tobacco but i am terrified i have Cancer or something as the frequency and severity of my infections make me worried. Howeber in September nothing was found",4

 I started smoking about 25 years ago when my friend Tyler brought a joint on our grade 8 camping trip.  I got really high and had a blast.   It came to light a few years later that Tyler's parents were both hard drug addicts and both ended up dying before we hit 30.  Before weed I was on every sports team my school had, I quickly dropped the sports to hang out with the boys and try and score and smoke as often as possible.  During this time (13-18) I dabbled with mushrooms which fucked me up way too much, ecstasy, which was a short lived jaunt, and alcohol.  I never really enjoyed any other drug but weed.  Boy did I love weed.  As the years went on the weed became more and more a part of my daily life.   I want to say it had little impact on my life in general, I still traveled (mostly sober) all over, but i did seek it out in countries known for it (Morocco, cambodia, holland, etc), luckily I never got busted.  Other than the lack of exercise I thought that my life wasn't really affected, I could still keep friendships going (with other weed smokers), I was happily married (my wife also became reliant) and I had a decent career ahead of me.  

8 years ago our first child died 2 days after birth, our beautiful son George.  I immediately quit my job and decided to heal as my #1 priority.  Except I don't know how to heal, I know how to smoke weed and tell myself that's healing.  I never healed.  A few months later my family thought that kick starting my career again would help my healing process.  We bought a restaurant (yeah in hindsight I would rather have cut off a toe).   6 months after my restaurant opened my wife gave birth to our daughter, beautiful, healthy and alive.  I took 2 days off (not really) and then went back to work, generally 6 days a week, 10-14 hours a day.  I smoked a lot during this time, thinking that it was stress management but in reality it would just tamp the emotions which would bubble up when I wasn't very busy.  After 3 years my wife gave me an ultimatum, close the restaurant and be part of the family or she would leave.  I of course closed the restaurant.

That was 5 years ago, I have been unable to hold a job for more than a few months since then.    Luckily my wife makes decent $$ and we haven't gone destitute.  I still smoke(d) about an ounce a week ($100-$160).  My wife would complain and beg me to help her quit every few months and I would brush it off.  During this time our daughter is growing up to be a great kid, except I can't keep up physically.  Since my restaurant closed I hurt my neck/back lifting my daughter and I've had chronic pain for almost 3 years.  Not wanting to get addicted to pain killers I upped my weed intake, great.  So basically I've been stoned morning to night as much as possible.  

I denied it was an addiction up and down until last night, during a nasty bout of flu I went to make myself a piece of toast and instead of grabbing the toaster I grabbed my weed container.  I have been denying the effect on my life, instead trying to focus on the fact that I don't smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or do other drugs.  And that I could smoke a joint and still ""function"", do grocery shopping, cook for my family and drop off/pick up my kid from school.  

I have turned into a shell of a human, the thing that I look forward to most is my next J.  One on the way home from walking my kid to school, and probably 6+ more during the day/night.  I shamefully remember bringing my baby onto the patio and turning her chair away and smoking a joint behind her back.  

I don't know who I am anymore, I have no aspirations, no more goals, and I'm watching myself getting sicker (body and soul) and farther away from the person I could have been, the person who my wife saw when she married me.  

So here I am, scared as all hell about what my future may bring, but excited to see what I can become.

I have almost no idea how to proceed other than not smoking weed. I am going to hit the gym and talk to the student services people at my local college.

First and foremost, I would like to thank YOU ALL for just being awesome in every way. I would have smoked YESTERDAY if it wasn't for reading some of your stories of months and years of absence. 

I was in complete denial. Thinking that life was better with Ms Jane rather than without her. I work as a secy guard on shift work, and have random days off by myself and although she guilt tripped me into all sorts of beneficial things ( I went to the gym, cleaned the house many times, washed the dishes, washed/hung clothes etc.. did all these chores because I got high and was feeling bad cos I'm a husband now and my wife deserves better) 

I now know that came from within. MJ helped me realise this compassion, and cope with my shitty ""alter-ego"" job, but it wasn't until a couple of co-workers got randomly drug tested about a month ago that I really had a scare and reconsidered smoking so much. I'm going clean cos I may or may not get tested, and I'm a big boy so I need at least 30 days to clear it I'd say

Benifits: 
I'm already enjoying much more focus and no haze.
Went to the gym yesterday and I sware I was burning the THC reserves cos I could sort of allow ""high vision""
I'm less forgetful already. Whereas before, I know my Mrs noticed me becoming stupified and more forgetful.
I no longer do things that make my Mrs feel unloved.. (I'd rather not elaborate out of respect for her but I never physically cheated).

Thanks for reading my weedless journey and showing me I'm not alone through these trials and tribulations.

Ive smoked practically everyday since I first tried it. I can still remember the overwhelming sense of calm it first let me experience. It was like I could finally take a deep breath, even if I was coughing my lungs out. I would constantly tell myself it’s good for me, good for my anxiety, that it helped me be the person I wanted to be. Yet I wasn’t happy, but I sure as hell was high and at that point I’d think what’s the difference. To me one was self induced the other unattainable. I was always chasing my next high, counting the minutes until I could get my hands on more bud, wax, carts, edibles.  I’d wait around for hours on a dealer or on my “friends” who could smoke me up. I’d risk putting myself in rather unsavory situations and loathsome company if it meant getting high. At least if I was high I wouldn’t care. Now that I’m clean I have all this free Time and I can’t help but think i should have stopped sooner, living in New York means I gotta hustle and working minimum wage isn’t gonna cut it. I have a good job for now and I’m surrounded by good people working in an office but this is only temporary and I’m hoping to get an apprenticeship as a carpenter with the city but they drug test. A big motivator is the thought that I could make a good living. I’m hoping to stay clean for a year to be safe before I apply. I’m glad I stopped but having to confront my emotions is difficult. I don’t have any friends to lean on, the ones who smoke and party don’t speak to me and the ones who don’t are busy chasing their goals. I feel so alone and tempted to just get high. I had a dream the other night I was high and broke my sobriety and I felt so relieved, for a moment I thought I can just keep being a fuck up. But here I am waking up to the reality that I’m being left behind by my peers and only I can pick myself up. I knew this already but being high meant I never had to fully accept it.",3

2020-02-12 21:52:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f333yy/day_15_what_ive_been_doing_to_get_some_relief/,Day 15 - what I’ve been doing to get some relief from crippling anxiety and daily panic attacks,"For reference: 25F, smoked on average once a week for a year, 3-4x a week for another year, and smoked heavily for the past 6 months or so. Total of almost 3 years smoking but only recently started abusing it. I’ve never had weed induced anxiety or panic attacks and never experienced this level of anxiety before. 

I’ve been reading and learning a lot about panic attacks and anxiety, as well as learning my limits as I’m highly sensitive to any kind of stimulation right now e.g tv, negative stories about death/people losing their minds/accidents etc, certain sounds and even certain people (mostly at work). 

Even though the anxiety is still crippling 95% of the time and I still have panic attacks every day, I learned some things that have been helping me ride this until it subsides. 

- I learned this thing called M.E.W.S from [Paige Pradko](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxe5Wpl9uZkgKMFnvuK9RMw). She’s a psychotherapist and I saw her comment somewhere on reddit - her videos have been helping me a lot. The M stands for ‘move your body’ when you reach level 5 of anxiety. She explains it helps burning the adrenaline and cortisol and can help making your panic attack less intense and shorter.
I just walk or dance for a bit and it helps. 

- Warm shower/bath and singing in the shower. Someone else on here mentioned that singing can be a powerful form of expression, and can give us some emotional relief. 

- Therapy. This one is self explanatory. I think it’s an essential part of healing when you’re going through intense withdrawals that are affecting you emotionally. 

- Journaling. I also learned that from Paige and she says that sometimes our brain just wants to know we’re giving it attention. She explains that anxiety comes from something that’s important to you, so when you journal you ended up giving space for your anxiety to communicate its worries.

- Welcome the anxiety and the panic. Last but not least, Paige suggested that you tell your anxiety to bring it on! And when you start feeling physical sensations from it (mine are usually sweating, shaking, and racing heart) tell your anxiety to give you MORE! I’m still scared when I’m saying it but I’m faking until I make it. I just say “bring it on you fucking bitch, I’ve been dealing with you for 10 fucking days now, I’m gonna fuck you up”. It’s fun and it makes the anxiety less intense because our brain understands we’re not scared.

- If you’re having health anxiety STOP entertaining it. I kept body checking, checking my pulse, etc. I’ve been aware of those compulsive behaviours and I can tell my health anxiety improved a bit.

Bottom line is: after my first panic attack I’ve been feeding into my anxiety because I keep getting scared of feeling that way again. Here are some important things to remember:

- panic attacks can’t and won’t kill you. It’s a natural reaction of your body. It normally lasts up to 30min and when it reaches its peak it lasts only 3-5 minutes. If you, like me, are scared when they happen and you feel like you can’t catch a break, you’re probably having waves of panic attacks one after the other due to your fear. 

- if you need to go to a doctor to get reassurance, do it! I now know my heart is as healthy as it can be, so when I start getting health anxiety because of my physical sensations I remind myself of the facts:
• this is just a physical sensation (therapist’s recommendation)
• I’m healthy, this is just my anxiety. 

It’s a fucked up situation. But I understand my brain will take some time to heal and at this point all I can do is wait.

Slowly, throughout years and years using I got depressed. Until the point I have realised I have a problem with it. Yeah, days and nights is difficult and I often thinking what’s the point. I’m sad and wondering if I will ever be happy again.
Reading your posts really help me as I can relate with some personal experiences.
Determined to stay clean and not to smoke - but tbh I caught myself thinking about smoking. Little green devil in my head is twisting my mind around. Sweating is constant, even when I think of weed, I get this uncomfortable fever all over my body. Insomnia is real guys. Cold turkey ... Jeez - I had feeling I’m one of main characters from book ‘We Children of Bahnhof Zoo’.

I was hanging with a friend and he almost talked me into it but I stayed strong.  I had another beer instead but stopped after that and didn't drink myself to sleep.

I have to say these past thirty days have been some of the most difficult days mentally of my entire life.  Here's where I stand right now.

The good: The first three days of this week have been cake compared to last week.  I don't feel normal yet, but I'm not shaking with anxiety and I've slept better this week.  Week four was absolute hell and I never want to have to go through anything like that again. My social interaction is improving and I'm becoming less ADD.  Controlling my emotions this week has so far been easier than last week.

The bad: Still craving pretty strongly.  Still angry and bitter about not being able to smoke, especially since a lot of it is a matter of me being forced to stop.  I'm really starting to look back at my smoking days as ""simpler times.""  This is normal and is a big reason why it's so difficult to get to 90 days.  While the withdrawals will continue to subside from this point, it's going to be much more difficult to actually not smoke this next month than the first month was.  Also still having vision problems (blurry, sometimes glare and halos around lights).

Sometimes soon I'm going to test myself to see if I'm THC free or how close I am so I can start job hunting.  A big part of why this quit has been so rough is how miserable I am at my current job.  Even with weed not in the picture, this would still be an incredibly rough time for me.",8

However, it seems that every day for the last few days there’s been this undercurrent of anger and resentment building up inside of me. Today it’s getting to the point where I’m practically cursing existence. An almost visceral feeling of antipathy to everything and everyone. 

I’ve been working out like crazy, meditating too and focusing on healthy ways of managing stress, but to seemingly no avail. 

Has anybody else dealt with this? I’m feeling very tempted to become seriously self destructive, or at the very least to just smoke a shitload of weed to numb it out.

Now I am better but motivation and ambition are lacking, depression is creeping in at times and I have an ever present level of anxiety; also, I have fractured sleep: I wake up at least once in the middle of the night, sweating (one night last week I was soaking wet) and have problems going back to sleep. I am dreaming, which means REM sleep is there, but I am not so sure about NREM sleep, since I am not sleeping soundly, and I think it's already taking a physical toll on my body. I started therapy already, but it is a process and I need to sleep. Now. I am tempted to go to the psychiatrist and see if they can help me to better navigate this period, but I think my brain is already feeble as it is and common sense tells me I should give it a chance to recover on its own. Is it something that will go on its own? Should I just wait longer and things will improve? I am not in a good place right now.

TL;DR: while decreasing weed, my last joint threw me into a three-day panic attack and I am mess now, getting crappy sleep night after night and with feeble mental health. Does it get better on its own?",7

I never really admited to it until very recently. I think this is common amongst potheads, more than it is in regular smokers.

Because pot makes you high, we tend to be more defensive of it, because it's not just chem addiction, it's also the habit of having your conscience altered 24/7.

As much as I hate (and always have) potheads who claim weed to be ""spiritual"" and ""cleansing"" and are people I know who just need to justify their constant consumption, I'm no different. I've denied it a million times, but I do hide from reality with weed.

I don't think I can progress much on my anxiety if I keep smoking every time I get it, it became my only coping mechanism and it sucks.

Today was my second day of starting to quit and I didn't manage to do the one thing I promised myself to, not smoke first thing in the morning.

I didn't have lunch and am already stoned out of my mind. 

When I opened up the window this morning, I saw a big cloud of smoke whirling and mixing with normal air. Of course, it isn't the first time I see this, but with this mindset, it did shock me. How am I supposed to feel motivated to do anything if I literally live in a haze?

I used to strongly believe weed didn't interfere with my performance, but it's not true, it does. I have to concentrate harder to get anything done, I feel disabled sometimes. Also, it would be nice to have 40€ more a week to spend on things I actually need.",15

I had tried many times before and would not be able to last long. This time was very different. To start I went on a four day fast. It was very difficult but after those four days the cravings went away for the most part. Sleep sucked for weeks tho. I remember it wasn’t till day 24 that I got a good night sleep. 

I’ll be turning 30 y/o this year and I want to enter this stage of my life in the best physical, mental and emotional shape of my life. There was nothing preventing from that goal but myself. There are days that will suck but tbh that’s just life. Smoking weed didnt fix anything. It just helps us not to face reality and instead of dealing with stuff is like piling up a mountain of sh*t.

To give you a bit of background I've smoked weed for about nine years now. I've been 'addicted' in some sense of the word for the better part of eight years. Trying to quit multiple times, with some moderate success. In the beginning, weed was just something I would do the odd weekend with some friends while hiking or exploring. Those are really important memories for me. However, my usage started to increases. Eventually to the point of smoking alone at home. I never really saw it as a problem. It was only out of boredom. However, I was terribly wrong. I had begun abusing marijuana. I still don't fully understand why I do it. I'm working on it. However, I have come to realize that I've been using to avoid difficult emotions and stressful situations. I've also become caught in a vicious cycle. Smoking late at night, wake up in a haze and the only thing that helps is hitting a bowl. My brain has many weird triggers, even loading screens in video games or certain sounds/songs will automatically make me reach for my weed. 

&#x200B;

Today was the final straw for me when I got home from work I was informed my family was going out for dinner to celebrate my days birthday. The thought made me anxious and upset. I quickly cut to my room and began to smoke up and suddenly everything was okay. It finally clicked what a shitty person I've become when I'm sober and how I've come to use marijuana to escape my problems. While thinking this over I had a major panic attack. Thinking over all the things I've ruined and destroyed for my addiction. All the missed opportunities. I was taken to the hospital by my parents because they didn't know what else to do. I was prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication until I can get to my therapist on Thursday. Please don't become like me, if you're early in your days and just start to think about quitting, do it now. You won't regret it, your biggest regret will become not quitting sooner.

&#x200B;

**What I want:**

* *Control over my eating and drinking habits*
* *Control over my sleeping schedule*
* *Waking up feeling well-rested*
* *Feel more comfortable in social situations*
* *Be more well-spoken (I catch myself saying 'damn dude.... or 'that's crazy' way too often)*
* *Clear Thoughts*
* *Better memory*
* *To be able to plan my day and stick to a routine*
* *To have and remember my dreams*
* *To be more reliable at work (Sometimes I refuse to cover for people because I'm high or want to get high.)*
* *Be a better friend*

**What I don't want:**

* *To feel like I wasted another year in my room smoking weed*
* *To feel paranoid all the time*
* *To have trouble sleeping*
* *To feel like I need something all the time to enhance my experience*
* *To waste money on a substance that doesn't make me better in any way shape or form*
* *Fried tastebuds (The few times I quit I noticed food tasted so much better)*
* *To waste time rewatching youtube videos, or things I hardly care about*
* *Smokers cough*
* *To become irritable when I haven't smoked in a while*

I've chosen to completely quit weed and realize I cannot have a healthy relationship. I'm hoping you can leave me some encouragement to help me get through the next few days.

I figured that removing that for a while would be a good way to see if and how it was holding me back from fulfilling my potential. This latest incident has now forced me to get off it and I'm kind of happy about it. I thought it would be almost impossible and though it is difficult I've been a week free of my green ""medicine"". I can't lie and say that I'm not looking forward to smoking again one day but I hope that if I do, I can moderate it appropriately (maybe on weekends or something). I dont want to rely on it to enjoy a movie or activity or even just to relax.

I feel like the worst is over (hopefully) but right now am just angry, bitter, and depressed. I feel like I’m becoming like many ex-alcoholics I’ve known who managed to quit drinking for external reasons and stay sober but were always angry and bitter and a drag to be around the rest of their lives. They were always wishing they could have a drink. My dad was one of these people.  He was once such a fun guy but around the time I was six he quit drinking and it was after that he became angry and abusive and that hasn’t changed to this day. I feel like without weed, that’s the future that awaits me. I guess it’s because I feel like I’m not good for much other than being a pothead and that was literally the one thing that gave me comfort and allowed me to escape my problems.",19

I'm still in undergrad, and I think if I didn't make the decision to allow myself to be addicted all these years, I probably would've finished years ago and I'd have a good job now.

On the bright side I'm graduating in December and my grades slightly improve every semester. I think I'm just training myself in spite of my setbacks, though.

I usually light up at night to help me sleep, but I think my sleep problems are caused by smoking, ironically. When I don't smoke all day I feel great, but at night it's game over. Also, I really cannot wake up in the morning after smoking myself to sleep.

I'm in a perpetual state of grogginess and I'm always thinking about my potential that I could reach if I wasn't smoking at all. I need to quit, again. It's just hard not being able to sleep and living with my girlfriend who can smoke multiple times per day and still function just fine (she is supportive, but if she's smoking, it's way too easy for me to justify it).

Any tips for sleeping while detoxing would be appreciated... Thanks everyone and good luck with your fights as well.",5

As above, after best part of a week with less than 6 hours sleep in total I gave in and smoked. Not great right? Well actually, I'm not that bothered about it and accept that's it's done and can now move forward easier.

The thing that broke me was that not sleeping isn't just tiring physically and mentally, but it also means instead of being awake and in your head for 16 hours a day it's more like 20, and if you don't sleep at all even more. The constant being awake just got to me. Everything is exhausting when you haven't sleep.

Any time I wobble I take something away from the experience, figure out a new trigger, add a new extra chance by changing things and use this to make the next time easier. But this time apparently stoned me had a direct message for recovering me 😳😂😂

I woke up today with this hand written message to myself, placed on the book I had been reading to replace my nightly urges:

""You were deliberately making yourself dissociate (aka mentally ill) to avoid reality.

WHO DOES THAT?!

STOPPED
FOREVER!""

Then I wrote pto 😂😂😂and more on the back...

""Work on sleep hygiene the rest will follow.

I LOVE YOU""

😳😳😳

So yeah. Something to process there for sure. But, taking that as stoned me's goodbye and moving on. I do feel rested today for the first time but that's down to luck more than anything, could've woke up feeling even worse. And I'm taking my own advice on the sleep hygiene thing so touch wood, it's about to get easier.

Anyways good luck fellow leavers 💪🏻",14

I developed CHS a while in, it's hard to rememeber how long/frequency i was smoking before it started happening. I had cyclic vomiting as a kid so when it started to happen i just thought it was that and i started smoking even more because i thought it would help with the nausea not realizing i was feeding into it more. When it started its must have been at least 5-6  years ago and there was so little about it online I'm shocked i stumbled accross CHS and there was so little research about it, i probably found MAYBE up to 5 threads about it on different sites? It took me a really long time to stop smoking because i was so dependent on it and the CHS was very inconsistent and appeared to come and go quite a bit so i think i thought i was better than it or something? I was so far into my addiction, i gained probably around 60lbs cause i got really bad munchies everytime i smoked and would eat more than i physically could, my already bad memory was getting worse, i was stealing weed from my roommate and i couldn't stop. What was really messed up about this was i was even getting seizures from smoking weed. I used to have a list in my phone of all the times i was high and blacked out and/or had a mini seizure including at a concert, my friends apartment, my own bedroom etc etc. I still wouldnt stop. I felt crazy even admitting to myself i had a problem becauee ""you can't get addicted to weed""

Anyways i digress, At one point it even seemed like the CHS went away on it's own and the only reason i ended up quitting weed was because i started hanging around a friend group that was more into drinking than smoking. It took months to be able to eat and sleep normally again but it didn't really bother me since i didnt have a job at the time and for some reason was ok about the fact that i was flunking out of school. I stopped smoking weed regularly for about 3 years after that and would do a little every couple of months. By that point  weed actually made me quite anxious in social situations and if i smoked any it would be very little as my tolerance had gone way down and a few puffs of a joint or a bong toke would get me wrecked. I started rewarding myself after finishing essays or assignments(i had switched to college at that point) by taking a bong toke to fall asleep. I was about a year in to dating my current boyfriend at that time who rarely smoked weed at that point but used to smoke probably more than i did at my worst. We started smoking more and more together and i was getting really worried that the CHS would come back but i had no symptoms at all. We moved in together last june and we've both been smoking pretty much everyday since. I had a hard time cause i joined crossfit and was really into trying to get fit and eating healthy but smoking pot really slowed me down because i would still constantly get the munchies and i had a hard time breathing at the gym. I also started feeling super crappy and sick in the mornings after smoking and binge eating but not to the same extent as before. Until yesterday morning, i woke up with that sulphar/rotton eggs burp and was a bit nauseous. When i got to the gym i was feeling dizzy and more nauseous and as i was driving to work after, i nearly had to pull over and throw up.i cancelled my shift and went home and laid in bed for a few hours and felt mostly fine until my second shift that evening. I didnt smoke last night as i knew that if i did the CHS symptoms would come back quickly and even though i didn't smoke last night i woke up with worse symptoms than yesterday althoughi havent puked yet. I think it's finally time for me to quit for good, and in a sick twisted way im kind if glad my CHS came back because ive been wanting to stop smoking since the end of last summer. Im actually pretty surprised it took this long to come back because i have been smoking pretty much everyday since probably the summer. Weed has ruined my memory, motivation and fed into my preexisting binge eating disorder and is something i never really wanted to start up again but it is near impossible for me as my partner smokes frequently and it's always in the house. I know this will be difficult as my partner will be continuing to smoke so if anyone got through this extremely long post-

Are there any suggestions on how to feel less shitty that your partner gets to continue to smoke weed whereas you cant because you will be physically ill?

Also im quite curious about what longitudinal research there will be about CHS in like, 10 years ie whos more likely to develop it and why.

Ps ill also be posting this on CHSinfo",5
2020-02-11 08:48:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f28k2c/dilemma_smoking_weed_social_anxiety/,Dilemma smoking weed + social anxiety,"Hi guys,

Let me quickly introduce myself and my problem first. I'm a 19 year old boy from the Netherlands and since 1,5 year ago I experienced symptoms of social anxiety first. 

It all started in 2016 (15 years old) when a friend of mine came with the idea to smoke weed for the first time with a bunch of friends. We did it and it was the most fun night of my whole entire life.

As you can expect because of the very positive experience we continued smoking weed. It went from every friday, to every friday+saturday, to almost every day in the week. For me it even went to everyday + a joint before sleeping every night.

Since 1.5 year back I experienced symptoms of social anxiety for the first time. I was biking back to home with a friend after a night of smoking weed with other friends. At that moment while I was talking with him I felt very nervous and I was stuttering a little and talking nonsense / . This was not me. I had the first awkward moment with my BEST friend in years. I didn't know anything to say, I felt kinda dead inside.

After that awkward situation the social anxiety continued with many more people and situations. I was constantly overthinking what to say, and by overthinking that the words always came out of my mouth stuttery and like I was nervous. Also everything I said didn't interest people. I could see in peoples eyes and people's body language they absolutely didn't give a f*ck about what I was saying / telling them. I never experienced that before either. People always we're interested in me before, they always liked me and talked to me. 

Now I'm at the point I don't say anything about my life anymore to anyone. Not even to family. I constantly have the idea that no one is interested in my life or what I say. It made me feel sad, dead inside and a little depressed you can tell. Also I quit school a few months ago because I am too busy with my online business. I have days I don't have any human interaction and it makes me feel depressed and lonely, like I don't have friends, but I have them. My mind is f*cking me you can tell. 

I know I have to do something about it, but I don't know what to do. I have a weed addiction (which I think it caused the social anxiety) and a small group of friends I smoke weed with. When I quit smoking, I probably will lose them, but I can stop the addiction. But the point is I don't want to lose them. I'm scared I still have the social anxiety after quitting the weed so I will be unable to make new friends. (How the hell am I even going to make new friends, I'm not in school anymore and running an own online business - no human interaction at all 🤦🏻‍♂️😂)

Somebody please help me. My mind is blowing up by overthinking.",3

Well, let's go

I started smoking marijuana when I was 18, today I am 26 and have tried to quit a few times (2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and a maximum of 8 months) and because of life dissatisfaction, unbalanced emotional side, lack of information about addiction and immaturity in the sense of not wanting to face your emotionally totally unbalanced (unconsciously speaking) as always wanting pleasure instead of pain.

Today I realize that our emotional side is the most important thing in our life, if it is balanced, life flourishes naturally, such as good relationships, good humor, clear thinking, self-confidence, etc.I believed that marijuana was nothing, that it didn't do much harm, with time I realized that this is a false belief, perhaps to comfort users.

Today I realize that marijuana has unbalanced my emotional side, I have been sober for 107 days and I feel the PAWS as anxiety, a little depression, tendency to isolation, and all of this makes me want to escape these feelings (unconsciously speaking). escape in the sense of trying to fill this void with anything, like watching any silly entertainment just to pass the time or doing something banal that doesn't add up to anything, like living a life without reflection doing stupid things.

And all of this I believe feeds depression, because i'm not living from the inside out, but from the outside in (was it clear here? for example: like a dream, you dream about something and then try to achieve it, but on the other hand, you wake up and turn on the tv to watch any shit, looking for distractions to distract the emotional side, like wanting to run away from yourself).

\*\*But when I am aware of this movement, then I can change.\*\*

I believe that anxiety and depression are related, in the sense of never wanting to face anxiety, and not facing it, I end up falling into the movement of cheap distractions(comfort zone) that I just exemplified. but this movement does not fill the void of the soul and deep down I feel more depressed for leaving the inner life aside.

And when life calls to something new that needs to be done, anxiety comes up, self insecurity, every emotional side comes up and sometimes we just run away from these new things to avoid discomfort.

Today I see that the problem is not anxiety, the real problem is to ignore anxiety, and ignoring it will never be cured. anxiety comes from the same place as good feelings. I realize that we have a certain vital energy and I think it is a tragedy to use it only for the trivial things in life. I believe that when we stop spending this energy in the movement of the comfort zone, we give energy to the emotional side, and the energy on the emotional side will help to balance the emotional, everything we look at gains strength and awareness. ""how would you direct the energy to the emotional side?"" I believe that when we stop with this external movement and just become quiet, like being silent we gain space and energy to perceive the inner life in a much better way. I believe this is the true meditation and not those crazy techniques that puts you in a mental position in search of something, I believe there is nothing to look for, because everything is already there, just a little confused, but when we calm down the confusion will resolve itself naturally because it gains vital energy, so life gets more and more clear.

I saw some reports that people stopped smoking and spent a good time and they still remained dissatisfied with life. I believe that the thing is not just to stop smoking and wait for time to heal, I believe that we have to look self inner.

I believe that any type of drug unbalances the emotional, even caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, etc., or even not a drug but a poor diet.

I believe I was a little repetitive, but I would like to make my thoughts very clear, I hope you have understood my point.

well, I hope you can all balance your emotional side and your life will shine like the sun! thanks and cya",11

I'm currently at uni so for me quitting has become my main priority due to the amount I spend on weed as well as the cravings for it, I wouldn't say I'm a 'hardcore stoner' but I've been smoking for about one and half years now, and have been having a joint every single day since, I use to smoke to calm my anger issues and also because I generally enjoy the feeling of having no worry in the world after having a nice joint after a tough day aha. I can safely say it has affected me in a mental kind of way? I'm not too sure about the effects of long term smoking of weed if a year is classed as long term aha, but recently I've noticed how different I am now compared to how I was before it and i can unfortunately say that my confidence has changed dramatically recently because of it, my anxiety which I haven't had since high-school has returned which I blame for my missing of lectures, and I've even had moments of paranoia over stupid moments with friends and family.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had any similar experiences and if it's normal to feel the same way I have done? What did you do to stop smoking weed easier? I'm aware of some of the withdrawals thanks to some websites I've come across but I'll greatly appreciate some guidance so that I can get my life back on track and be back to my normal self without the dependency.

Thank you and sorry for the long read!",2

2020-02-10 17:58:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f1yn6i/new_hobby_is_owning_me/,New Hobby is owning me!,"Hi folks. So quick background: I’m 33, I started smoking at 17 and I first quit in November 2018. Last year was hard, I thought about smoking most days but I stuck with it until December at which point I thought “fuck this I’ve had a good detox for a year, I’m going to smoke....”

And I did, on around a dozen occasions over the holidays. It was good (not awesome but I enjoyed it) and i had every intention of continuing into 2020. 

But on the first of Jan I impulse bought myself a 3D printer. 

I can honestly say I haven’t smoked since it was delivered. In fact I’ve hardly even thought about weed. This bit of kit, the seemingly endless possibility’s and challenges it presents, is all consuming and constantly thought provoking. The anticipation of how a thoughtfully sliced model is going to turn out, watching it take shape layer by layer and the satisfaction you get when you finally pop it off the build plate is easily up there with the pleasures I got from smoking. 

I know it’s only been a month and obsessions can loose there momentum after a while, but I can’t really see how it’s going to with this, as there is always something else to make and model ideas to design.  When I’m at work I used to thing about smoking when I got home, now I spend all day thinking about what I’m going to print, how I’m going to tweak my settings. 

If your looking for something to fill the hole that quitting weed has left, and can spare a couple of hundred quid, I’d thoroughly recommend diving into this avenue. All you need is a laptop, the software is free and easy to learn and there are hundreds of YouTube videos to help get you started.  You don’t need any 3d modelling skills as there are websites chock full of things to print for free like thingiverse or my mini factory. It really is a most enjoyable hobby, relatively inexpensive and seemingly pretty safe. 👍🏻

Happy quitting all.",3

Put all my weed stuff in a box and didn't touch it since then.

Fast forward to today, I started cutting my arm again. Now while that has happened before, it hasn't for like 4 months. I'm pretty sure that has to do with me stopping smoking, because I did use weed as a 'distraction' from the urge of cutting.

Now I am not sure if I'm making a good choice. My therapist told me I should stop repeatedly and while I think she has a point, I don't know if I should, when the 'alternative' is butchering my arm. I would prefer talking with her about it, but my next appointment is almost 2 weeks away.

I'm right now at 2 nights without smoking, which is the longest time I did go without weed in like 9 months. 

well I guess that's that, thanks for reading and please, leave me some thoughts on the situation. Should I try to keep myself from smoking and 'risk' more cutting or should I continue smoking which would (most likely) keep me from cutting *(Edit: until I have the opportunity to speak to my therapist about it)*?

I thought I'd still have some for when I got back home. 

It's just ridiculous. I hadn't smoked in a week (it's been really hard to find for the past several months). Thought for sure it would last me a while. 

Idk, I'm just depressed and lost now. There's never enough weed. If somebody were to offer me some I'd definitely buy it. So I guess it's probably good that nobody is offering to sell me any. Because what is even the point.

Reminds me of being an alcoholic. There was just never enough booze. Same thing now, minus the hangovers. 

I wish I'd quit for good just so I can bury this stupid cycle. Smoke, run out, hate being sober, buy more, smoke, run out, etc. Forever. All I can think is I wish I had some fucking wax so I could maybe actually get high instead of just feel more ""normal"". But I don't even have a plug for that anymore.

i am a longtime lurker of this sub, but a first-time poster. i can’t tell you how many people’s stories i have been inspired by over the months/years. 


i have accomplished a lot of goals over the past two years or so, but one thing i have not been able to conquer (yet) is kicking the habit of smoking weed every day. 


today is the first day of my weed-free journey, and i am hoping this one lasts longer than my previous “first day”s. 


something that i think will be very helpful, at least during the first couple of weeks, is journaling about it. i semi-recently picked up the habit of keeping a daily journal. it was tough to stick to at first, but i have grown to love the clarity, catharsis, and room for reflection it provides. 


this got me thinking.. i should use my new habit of journaling to help me kick my soon-to-be old habit of smoking weed. i think the best way to start is with a series of lists, so i can really get everything out there about why i want to quit. i have come up with a couple different list topics so far, i was hoping you could help me come up with a few more. ultimately i would love to have up to seven topics i can write about/list out during this first week! 


1. reasons why i want to quit. focusing on negatives (ie weed makes me lazy, wastes money, ruins my diet, etc.)

2. things i’ll gain by quitting. focusing on the positives (ie more time to pursue other hobbies, more money to save for my future, more energy and motivation to accomplish goals, etc.)

3. what to tell myself whenever i have an urge. (i am stronger than my cravings, i won’t enjoy it as much as i think i will, [person’s name] would be so disappointed, etc.)

4. alternative actions i can do instead of smoking (work out, go for a run/walk, read a book, meditate, etc.)


that’s all i have so far, hoping you guys can help me think of more, and hoping this helps at least one other person in the process!",5

You owe it to yourself to get to where I am,"Just popping in to remind you all to stick at it. I smoked for 10 or so years and for the last 5 years that was non stop all day every day. I quit because it was giving me terrible anxiety and depression. I know there's plenty of people who will try to claim that this was something to do with an underlying issue or i ""smoked the wrong strain"" or some garbage like that. Those people are moronic. The notion that you can wring your dopamine out like a wet sponge every time you smoke and not have to pay the consequences for that in the long run is ludicrous. Think of it like taking out a loan on that good feeling - you gotta pay it back with interest eventually!

Anyway so after getting bad anxiety and panic attacks etc etc i finally quit! The first 3 months were quite literally almost unbearable and now hold the undisputed title of the worst period of my entire life. I got over it though and the 3 months after that were merely highly unpleasant - the 3 after that only unpleasant. Now I'm three months after THAT i can say i feel absolutely great. The anxiety still pops in to visit occasionally but it's nowhere near as strong and goes away far quicker. I can honestly say i cannot wait to see how i am in another year.

So keep it up fellow r/leave'ser. No matter how bad it gets and how terrible you feel I can with total certainty and utter sincerity tell you that there is light at the end of your tunnel and that the rewards of quitting are better than the rewards of smoking ever were. I feel categorically better in every single way - even in ways that people always associate with weed. By that i mean I enjoy food more, music, movies, books, everything - the sensation of living is greatly enhanced, the sensation of sleeping is far more peaceful and refreshing. You heard me.

Accept that you are an addict. A lot of potheads mess around with words like ""stoner"", ""smoker"", etc. Once you can admit to yourself that you *are* a weed addict, you can make the right choice more consistently. 

For instance, not having any weed around you. If you were an alcoholic, would you keep booze around? Of course not. And even though weed doesn't have the same physical addiction properties as alcohol, it is still an addictive substance and must be treated as such.

2. Downloading a sober app. I use Sober Time personally. This thing is such a huge part of my continued sobriety - it keeps a timer of how many months, days, hours, minutes I've been sober. I highly recommend getting this. I'm at 5 and a half months now and it is a huge motivator to keep going, just based on having a running timer that I'm proud of. I genuinely don't want to reset the timer and watch all of my work disappear.

I’m in my early 20s, and have been smoking weed relatively consistently for the last 4-5 years. What I always felt was strange about my situation with weed, is that I never felt like I was addicted to it, and this was for a few reasons.

Firstly, I’ve realised how situational my cravings / desire to smoke are. To give you some context, I started smoking weed properly when I went to university in 2015, where it seems to be the norm, and I fell in love with being stoned / the social aspect that you gain with it - it became such a happy place whether it be gaming / chilling with friends and smoking, or going out on little adventures to the park etc. However, whenever I would go back to my parents house, whether it be a week or for a few months - I would barley think about it and only a few times had I smoked at all, this was because my parents didn’t know I smoked and I had barley anyone around me that did so. But, whenever I would return to where I live now (same place as I went to university), I would immediately want to smoke again, just the idea of having those same experiences and amazing times with people would trigger it, that, and so many people around me smoke.

I currently live with a fair few people, 3 of which are people who smoke quite relentlessly - so I know that this will make quitting a lot harder, but I’ve come to the point now where I know it’s what I need to do. Despite knowing I will always enjoy smoking, not only have I started feeling negative affects on my physical health, such as quite constantly feeling very run down and low energy, as well as quite ill (sometimes feel like I’ve permanently had a cold), but I’ve also realised that the things that I used to enjoy so much sober, such as playing video games, my guitar, etc etc, a lot of these things now I don’t find as interesting or fun unless I’m stoned - this is the kick in the teeth I’ve really needed. 

I’m still a relatively active and productive person, I cycle every day to my job which is in an office, and go bouldering / climbing 3-4 times a week, but hate the fact that my idea of relaxing in the evening has to involve smoking, and not to mention the amount of money I spend on it, and subsequently the ridiculous amount I will spend on food when I am high.

As of now, (besides from a few tokes at a party on Friday evening), I haven’t smoked since Wednesday evening. Currently I’m not feeling awful, but more, just a bit vacant and a bit lack lustre (kinda hard to describe as I’m sure you will all know) - but something has switched in my brain where I know that the time has come to accept that I am addicted and reliant on it.

I hope if you’ve read this that it might help you realise things in a positive way or just help you think differently. Please feel free to ask me anything, give me advice, or, if you just want to share what you’re going through -  go ahead :).

Thank you, I’m grateful I’ve realised this community is here - I’ve been listening to some videos of how positive and energetic people have felt since they’ve quit, and can’t wait to have a productive and positive 2020.

Soon to be ex-stoner,

A friend.",3

However, I have also heard the argument made by some in the psychology community and other addicts that many believe that drug addiction is fixable, and that in actuality the idea that it is not curable is a perpetuated myth that is unhealthy.

I got to a point in life where I had the choice between continuing my unhealthy lifestyle of smoking joints, drink booze, eat trash McDonalds all day and being a smalltime criminal or become a greater version of myself and picking up my old habits of working out at least 4 days a week, actually cooking healthy meals at home and coming in terms with problems in my life and facing them instead of running away and clouding my mind, instead I from now on want to experience life sober and go to school again to get some a education and degrees.

It feels like I already spent a majority of my conscious life in this intoxicated state where it almost feels weird spending so much time sober and I know that 3 weeks is nothing compared to the almost 5 years doing all kinds of drugs, but experiencing the withdrawal and changes in my brain chemistry make me want to quit for real and opened my eyes that Maryjay is indeed a drug, maybe not as harmful as other and even medicine for some people, for me it's not good..

From LSD to opiates, pep and Cocaine I've been always quite eager to experiment all kinds of highs though never a substance hooked me quite like weed, because in my mind I thought to my self

""its just a plant so its okay to smoke it all day everyday"" and ""at least I am no cokehead or smoking heroin in the Metro""

when I did other drugs for a longer period I felt dirty and could feel how they drained me, weed on the other hand was my ""friend"" that would never harm me, like I also had to learn over the years you meet a lot of false friends in life and it's up to you to distuingish the people that make  your grim life a little brighter and the ones that silently bring more chaos in,same goes for habits and addiction.

English is not my native language and thank you for taking the time for reading my little essay

ott is a slang word in my region for cannabis here is a little charcoal drawing I drew in one of my many sleepless nights

I had a questions regarding my smoking method and quitting. In my previous attempts it was almost always combustion, I've been using vaporizers for the past few weeks and wondered if anyone here thinks it will make a difference in the quitting process as far as having less garbage in your system to flush out in the first place.

A little about me:

Lurked this sub since September, quit October, had 2 relapses but currently 20 days sober! I have gone to an AA meeting or group therapy every day for those past 20 days. I find that without those, I start to crave it and slip up. AA is quick, easy, painless, and free, and it helps me and many other people trying to live sober and meet other sober people. If you haven't tried a meeting yet, I highly recommend it.

 I'm making sobriety a habit for my new life that sticks for good. They say it takes at least 30 days to make a new habit, but I think it takes even longer when overcoming addiction. I started at 15, became addicted around 17, and quit at 20. I've used it too long. It stopped being fun and started controlling me, destroying my life and relationships in the process. I hope to take back some agency with these affirmations. I hope they can help someone else, too. You can do it!",8

I finally have a salaried job and need to stop making the excuse that I’m a poor college student because that’s been the “big” reason for not trying harder to quit, yet I took the time to work small jobs in college to spend my money on weed. Now I can afford an ounce no problem so, I’m getting high before and after work and for what? I have tried a few times to quit, but I can’t commit. Some fear inside keeps holding me back and I’ve been working that out in therapy and meditation. 

I keep seeing ‘start exercising’ suggested by a lot of people. That’s something I feel like I can add to my daily living, but I don’t know where to start. I was never taught how to ‘exercise’. If y’all could suggest or share any links or workouts to help me start somewhere, that would be much appreciated.. I never ask for help and I think that’s the other problem.

I had been continuously high for so long that I literally couldn’t even comprehend what my life would be like otherwise. 

Nevertheless, after a few failed attempts at moderation, I decided to quit. I won’t pretend like it was easy - I had to really power through those first few weeks.

But as someone who thought so little of sober life, I really want you all to know how much better I feel now. I don’t have a constant feeling of “I need to stop this” hanging over my head. It’s not like all my problems in life are solved, but hey, I now have a major life accomplishment under my belt. I took something out of my life that I was hopelessly addicted to.

That is how I felt for 5 years of smoking straight. 14 days ago I began a challenge to test out my willpower and in order to see if it was possible to rid my brain of this feedback loop that was ultimately  destroying my ambitions and fulfillment with life.

On day 1 I decided to quit more than weed, I said I would stop alcohol (for the time being as I lose some weight), I said I would stop weed, and I said I would get my butt on some form of cardio machine until I sweat at least one drop (this is more psychological, I haven't gone done less than an hour of cardio yet) for 100 days straight. The only vice I said I would keep was nicotine (especially this form of concentrated tobacco called Dokha which I smoke every morning and night multiple times). I have a finsta (aside from my ""official"" instagram account) for close friends where I have been posting every single day I am at the gym with a counter saying what day it is, I place these posts in a story highlight on my finsta and I honestly can't wait to have it completed until day 100 where I can just click away and see all my progress including weigh ins.

For the first 4 days I felt like absolute \*\*\*\*, during this period I would drink a lot of hot water with relaxation inducing teas in order to trick my body into thinking I had some form of external relaxation. I would take ZZZquil and other sleep supplements in order to help me sleep. 

Day 5-13 I began feeling a slight sense of mental clarity, yet not my full potential (and I doubt I am there yet). I went to a guitar lesson and got full bloodwork in order to check if everything was in check. I discovered that I enjoy playing the guitar, I enjoy reading, I am more pre-occupied about my health and tend to base present decisions not on the short-term impact it will have on me, but on the long term benefits that come with making said decision.

Day 14, Today, my brain is feeling much clearer. So much clearer that I have decided to quit my Dokha (concentrated tobacco) smoking for good. Even further, I have always said that the alcohol abstinence was temporary as it would help me with my weight loss; I have now decided that alcohol is not for me (I have gone out to clubs twice sober and have had amazing experiences, especially watching everyone get drunk as the night goes by). 

Day 15 (Tomorrow): I am so excited to weigh myself tomorrow, to do some reading, to meditate, to learn some more guitar riffs, to speak to people with a positive mindset of enthusiasm and learn more about the world and the infinite amounts of knowledge available to us. I am no where near peak mental performance, but I definitely feel way better than I did 15 days ago.

Hope you quit too,

In all seriousness, it isn’t good to pick up one bad habit for another (such as unhealthy diet and irrational spending) ; however, after a long few weeks my shift got cancelled because of high winds |Im a horticulturist| therefore I decided to take a rest day for myself! I am almost 40 days in. The number itself is less relevant than it was the first week, although it is nice to check in from time to time. I hope you all are finding as much happiness and success as I am. I spend more time with my family, less money on weed, and more $$ on myself. Whether it be saving dough or cashing it on a spa day I find it to be beneficial beyond measure compared to my old habits.

P.S. Next Thursday I meet Major Bill White!! He is the oldest living Marine Veteran of current times and he is sitting at a young 104 years old! Stoner me would feel way to anxious to encounter such a character; however, I am now confident in myself to the extent I no longer feel anxious about social interactions. No matter who you are I like to believe you have something worth listening too which is why I try and start a conversation with everyone I encounter should I have the time. I hope this little update proves to be an interesting read, there have been times where I felt alone and others where I couldn’t be in better company however through all situations I made the decision to stay clean 👍🏼 it’s a struggle, it’s a process, but it’s NECESSARY.

I have to admit that I already slipped up after joining Leaves just a couple days ago with the intention of quitting marijuana for good...

I wanted to hang out with my buddy, against the best wishes of my fiancee, so I could explain to him in person that I want to quit smoking weed and that I probably wouldn't be hanging out with him a lot going forward. I went to his place with the intention of abstaining from smoking, but in the end I couldn't resist after he kept showing me all the goodies he just brought back with him for Colorado. 

Well I ended up taking one dab of oil, but only after I promised him I wouldn't tell my fiancee, as I have been in hot water with her in recent weeks with smoking and hiding it from her. I can't lie, in the moment I enjoyed being high and hanging out with him, and we ended up going out to grab dinner together. But I ended up eating way too much and was left with a pretty hefty bill for just a casual seafood dinner.

When I got home I was contemplating whether or not I should be honest with my fiancee about having slipped up and smoking with my buddy. But I decided to level with her and admitted to taking a dab. Fortunately she was very supportive and just glad that I didn't try to hide it. It may not seem like a big deal, but this was a big step for me!

This morning I woke up feeling groggy and gross having smoked and eaten way too much the night before. However I didn't wake up thinking about the next time I would get high. Instead I had a desire to hit the gym and burn off some calories! I also did a yin yoga class, which I feel is very helpful to disconnect from the stresses of daily life.

I have now once again reached the one day mark of being sober from smoking weed, and am looking forward to making it one more day this time tomorrow. However I know there will come a point when I miss hanging out with my buddy, even though I feel like he doesn't have my best interests in mind.

So I'm seeking some suggestions for getting through my next weak moment when I feel like smoking with my buddy. I have decided that I don't want to hang out with him until I at least get a few weeks of sobriety under my belt. But perhaps I need to think about cutting ties and making new friends? In the past I have been hesitant about just not hanging out with him anymore, but I'm finally starting to recognize that hanging out with him triggers my bad habit and causes me to relapse.

I am somewhat embarrassed admitting that I have already slipped up, but I wanted to be honest with the group here and hold myself accountable. I appreciate you guys understanding and offering any words of advice or encouragement. Here's to taking it one day at a time!",5

Smoked my undergrad away and my life revolved around my next smoke. Used it as a coping mechanism for a lot of shit and stayed in a hole. Would come home and immediately crack a beer open and have a smoke. Had been wanting to quit smoking for a while, but couldn’t find the motivation. Then I saw r/leaves, and discovered that weed addiction was a real thing and that other people were suffering too. Finally left r/trees, and discovered the app grounded, and that I’m not alone in this journey. Started therapy, running and eating healthy again. No more gross munchie meals and sneaking out to the car, constantly worried about the smell and getting caught.

It was weird because I’m my dream I didn’t even really want to, but I still did it anyways, didn’t even enjoy being high at all, just felt guilty and wanted to be sober and felt awful for breaking a 10 month streak. But at the same time, I didn’t totally beat myself up. I thought, this doesn’t negate all of the progress I’ve made. I was still sober for nearly a year, this doesn’t put me back at the beginning of sobriety, struggling and feeling shitty and guilty and horrible all the time. I was still nearly a year sober with one little slip up. It didn’t mean I had to spiral and hit rock bottom and smoke 6 blunts a day and start drinking again. It just meant I’m human and I had a moment of weakness and I learned from it. So if you’re back on day one after a long stretch, or even after just a week (which feels pretty damn long and you should still be proud of!), remember that you’re making progress for even having the desire to be sober, for even attempting it. Don’t be too hard on yourself, it’s hard to break habits that we’ve had for years or even decades. But also remember that the little bit of relief you get from smoking (which it usually isn’t relief at this point, just anxiety, guilt, paranoia, wasted money) is nothing compared to all of the things that sobriety will bring you.     
        












My life is better than ever now. I’ve filled up 2 journals since June (I quit around 4-20) and read bits and pieces of them last night, and the progress I’ve made is amazing. I’m more thoughtful, a better writer, and over time I’ve become much kinder to myself. The half of the first journal is just how awful I feel, how guilty I feel. But it gets so much better. I’ve gotten into meditation, affirmations, yoga, philosophy. I wouldn’t have done any of these things in a million years if I was still a pothead. I take better care of myself mentally, physically, spiritually. I floss everyday, I cook healthy meals (most of the time), I read and wrote, I try new things and go new places. I’m healing from all of the damage I did to myself, healing from the trauma that made me abuse drugs and alcohol in the first place, and I’m really proud. I know this kind of turned into a tangent, but I just wanted to shout my thoughts and feelings into the void, at other recovering potheads, since my journal is all filled up now. Thanks for reading, stay strong you guys! ❤️",5

Am on day 25 (yay me!!) and about a week ago I remembered the spike mat I bought back in 2010 when it was all the rage around where I’m from - and decided to finally give it a shot. 

I have posted before about my weighted blanket, which is a 7/10 or so helper when it comes to sleeping, which I have had trouble with after quitting, like many do.

The spike mat is a godsent. 10/10. Seriously. First night I was aiming for 20 mins, as mine says recommended for 20-40 minutes - and woke up 2 hrs later! I must have fallen asleep in 15 mins or so, because I remember looking at my watch at 12 mins, thinking «wow, this really *is* relaxing!» 

I slid it out from underneath me and had one of the best nights sleep in a LONG time (confirmed by my Apple Watch sleep tracker Autosleep).

Every night since then had been the same - gone way before the 20 min mark. 

Not the exact one, but quite similar - https://www.amazon.com/ProSource-Acupressure-Pillow-Relief-Relaxation/dp/B00I1QCPIK/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=spike+mat&amp;qid=1581279575&amp;sr=8-3 - mine was mat only, am waiting on the pillow by mail order.

It is almost 9:30 PM where I live, can’t wait for 10 PM when I tak meltoning and get ready for bed. It relaxed me to the moon and off to sleep, I will keep ignoring the 20-40 min recommendation as long as it keeps working like this. (If someone in here knows why it is «only» recommended for that time frame, I really don’t want to know - because what it does for me is simply amazing!)

Might help others too, so thought I’d share.",2

Had a surprisingly shitty day,"I've been smoking most of the time for the last 5-6 years, having some breaks (once for a few months but usually just a few days or weeks).
It's been a month now, I'm happy about that and for the first time I don't have the slightest desire of smoking. But I still think that there are some withdrawl symptoms. There are still some rough nights, especially if i can't force myself to do some kind of workout during the day (seems like i need it every day). And I also seem to have some emotional freakouts. A few minutes before I started crying after having a day full of anger and hatred, I should've been studying but nothing was done in the end of the day. I start to feel better now but it was a hell of a day...

On those shitty days I usually think about what I did to myself by smoking that much. How I pushed tasks away, how I decided to change, then smoked again, how I fucked things up, relationships, dates, jobs, promises, basically how I lied to myself all the time.
Everything seems to come back at you, you realise those fuck ups with your (kind of) sober Mind now.

I'm also realising how much ,in my eyes, horrible shit is going on around me, this is probably the worst part for myself, I think it was one of the biggest reasons for relapsing a few times before, just to not give a fuck in the end...

I don't know if this is a problem or if I just have one of those ""addictive"" personalities, but I started smoking about a year and a half ago after moving to Colorado and haven't really been able to stop since.

I did a bit of time in the military, and the doctors prescribed painkillers in six month stocks for some reason, so I'd get about 200 painkillers at once. I'd take one for some pain, and after about 2 or 3 weeks the bottle would be gone. I always feel like I have to chase a bigger and bigger high. Idk why. Same with ambien, they prescribed it for insomnia and I began taking them heavily. Again, no idea why. I have super terrible impulse control and any time I have a sort of mind-altering substance I have to keep having more and more. It becomes the only think I can think about, waiting for the next high, or the next hit. I want to stop but I am so scared about what is going to happen, the longest I've made it has been about 2 months, but that was for a drug test and I started smoking the hour after I tested. I just want to be done with it, and have that mental clarity again. Feel good about myself and where my life is headed.

Thoughts?,"Hi guys, I’ve been posting here since I quit almost 12 days ago. I had a panic attack last Saturday and had a hell of a week. I had another one last night that didn’t subsided after 6 hours.
At that point, I needed some reassurance that I was going to be ok (I’m trying to be as rational as possible when I’m having one of those, but it’s HARD) and went to the E.R.
Bottom line is, the doctor said that due to my heavy consumption in the past 6 months (1-2 grams a day) I shouldn’t have quit cold turkey.
That hurt to hear, it was so hard to quit and I really can’t taper. He said I should try and taper if I’m feeling this distressed.
The thing is: I don’t want to smoke. I know it’s just 12 days but those days were really hard and if I smoke again I’ll lose my progress, won’t I? I haven’t even had any cravings and after everything I went trough this week due to my extreme anxiety since my panic attack I really don’t want to ‘waste’ those days were I suffered.

I got put in an 8 dorm suite, and the roommates I share a bathroom with were huge stoners, but I loved them. They got me into smoking and I ended up becoming a lazy pothead, not doing anything except sleep and smoke, and I ended up on academic probation. 

I thought this semester would be a new start, but instead of smoking weed I smoked nicotine, and found myself broke. Then I broke up with my boyfriend, and I bought a quarter ounce to help some. I am no longer a lazy pothead, but a very productive stoner who can do work after 2-3 gb hits.

After I broke up with my boyfriend, I started thinking. I'm 5'3 but weigh about 190lbs, have a food relationship problem, nicotine addiction, and I would still like my grades to be better. So I decided a revenge body, and mindset, were needed. 

My plan for this is to go to the gym at least 4x a week, for an hour each time (even if just walking on a treadmill), stop smoking ASAP (and my bank account is empty because of this, so I can't buy more), stop picking up weed, restart therapy, and eat healthier.

I know this is long and not just about quitting THC, but it would be fun to have a buddy with me along the way of my total restart!

My therapist and I want to do EMDR together, but she won't do it until I can pass a drug test. This is fine with me; I've known I needed to quit for a long time. I was able to quit concentrates a month ago, but kept on smoking flower. I could easily put away two grams of wax a week, and flower barely gets me high anymore. I was spending hundreds of dollars a month on it, and letting my bills go. I'm in bad financial shape right now because of weed, and I almost lost my job for getting high at work.

I need EMDR. I have some serious childhood trauma I've been smoking to avoid. I have to try to get past it, and stop letting what happened to me make me feel like a bad person. I can't get past this stuff if I keep living in a cloud of smoke.

Today is day two, and I woke up and vomited. I couldn't eat dinner last night -- a few bites made me feel sick -- and I definitely don't feel like eating anything. It's snowing, but I'm going to try to go out and get some orange Gatorade and drink that today.

I'm also going to a SMART recovery meeting tomorrow night. If any of you have any experience with SMART, I'd love to hear about it. (For those of you who don't, it's a science-based, god-free alternative to AA.)

You see, even though I was aware of my issues even while toking, I just didnt give much fucks about it. It got to me from time to time, but I was ""okay"" with my shitty life. 

But today it slapped me really hard and it doesnt motivate me, it destroys me. I wanna forget and be complacement again, but I know that if I do it, I will never change my life for the better.

You see, I created this account when I was deepest in my depressive thoughts. It was a time when I cried every day, hence the name and today it almost feels like those 3 years ago. It is very sad that I am having issues for more than 3 years and did nothing about it. 

My biggest issue is that I am coward, epsecially when it comes to social situations and dating. I am 24 year old inexperienced loser (almost virgin, lost it to hooker) who works low paying job and lives with parents. I dont have any real friends, all those ""friends"" I have are basically superficial relationships mostly based on weed toking. 

I honestly dont know if I am even worth living life. I think I shouldnt be here, but I dont want to hurt my parents and I also dont wanna give up so easily. 

Sorry if this post is little over the top but I just had to post this. For my own good.

It would be great if some people could relate to this or just give their opinion. Either here in the comments or feel free to send me a message.

Cannabis kept me pretty mellow about the test, but now that it’s so close AND I’m not stoned, I’m freaking out a little. I’ve always felt so comfortable functioning stoned - spent most of college priding myself on my ability to get through anything high. I’m a good student overall, & have diminished my consumption significantly since the beginning of college. Right now though, I feel hyper-aware of this stupid standardized test & I’m fearing failure pretty hard. My mind’s considerably more clear when I’m not high (duh), but it just feels different to study sober. Different is not what I’m stoked to be feeling going into a difficult exam.

2020-02-08 20:39:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f11hfa/did_you_ever_come_clean_to_loved_ones_and_what/,"Did you ever ""come clean"" to loved ones and what did you say?","Editing to add a tl;dr and clarify:

* My spouse knows all about my weed usage, there's no huge secret here
* I'm looking for advice on how to open up a conversation on the emotional impact that my impulsive use has had for her
* Part of that I think is ""coming clean"" in the sense of being explicit about things we've both known but have left unspoken. It's not literally about revealing unknown stuff to her  


Particularly interested in the stories of folks who've been quit for a year or more.

I've lived with my partner for more than a decade, married for about half that time. She knew I was a bit of a pothead when we first met and it was a point of tension between us for a while. Eventually, for reasons that I don't know that I ever got forthrightly from her, she just decided to make her peace with it, I guess because she was in love and felt like there were enough good things about me that a relationship  would be worth it.

We were long distance for the first while and it was easy enough for weed not to be a huge regular issue between us for that reason. When we moved in together, I was an every-day-if-I-could-get-it vape user, kind of keeping it out of her face by only using in the evenings after she went to bed. This created an immediate issue between us because she didn't want to always go to bed alone--I mean, who would? But it wasn't something I was willing or at the time felt able to change. So again she made her peace with it.

Over the years my use fluctuated up and down but mostly up. I always did my best to keep it out of her sight and I regularly lied to her about being high, telling myself she couldn't tell. In retrospect I think that sometimes she could, sometimes she couldn't. Sometimes she'd really bust me, like a time a couple years ago when I ducked into the storage room of our apartment for a quick two hits before a family outing to the park. (Jumped in the car and she looked straight at me and said, ""wow it really smells like weed in here."" I could have died.)

I don't want to belabor this, I'm an addict and out of shame I hid this part of myself from the person I'm closest to, and it created a lot of ""spin-off"" conflict over the years that was more about the lying and subterfuge than the drug use itself. I feel lucky she stayed with me but also feel terrible about the emotional upheaval and strain I put her and our relationship through. I've been thinking lately that I want to have, I don't know, some kind of conversation with her about it all. But it's so much time, so many parts of our lives, such an overwhelming thing, that I just don't know where to begin. And I don't know what I want out of it, except that I don't want her to have to feel like she needs to make peace with anything anymore, including any apology I make. It was never fair to her to expect that.

So I'm just wondering if anyone has ever had a conversation (or multiple conversations) like this. Not admitting to use, that was never a secret between us, but talking about the ramifications and the strain it put on a loved one. And if you have any advice for me.",7

People always ask... ""When will the dreams end?"" ""When will I stop being anxious?"" Why would they end when your mind has some unresolved stuff to work on?  It's really disturbing to wake up from a vivid dream that hits too close to reality. But then again, it's better than the alternative of hiding in the weed.",37
2020-02-08 19:27:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f10izr/two_months_sober_brain_still_trying_to_trick_me/,"Two months sober, brain still trying to trick me","I started smoking weed regularly since I was 16. Those several gravity bongs a day took their toll on my career, relationships and overall stable critical thinking. Eight years later I'm on my longest streak without weed (nearing two months). I've tried quitting countless times before. Anyone can push through the physical withrawals. Past the initial month or so, the real work begins - addressing and working on the issues that got you in that loop in the first place, and next to that, coming to grips with your new life and learning how to live it. (Forever ever? Fo eva-eva? FO EVA-EVA?)

My brain is still rewiring itself and at times I do feel hopeless and bound to return to my old ways. I am doing more and more things to ""fill the void,"" like working out, eating my veggies, reading books, making art and writing more than before. One day I might feel very good about all the positive changes. Other days my brain would concoct new rationalizations why smoking up again would only add to all the good shit. Or how I never had a problem and I simply like smoking weed. Thoughts like that sometimes manifest for days until I shake them out. It's not my brain talking tho, it's the addiction.

Feeling empty without this ""light"" drug only reaffirms how strong my addiction is and why I need to keep going. The progress is not a smooth, linear, upwards progression. The first week was hard. The days after the first month were actually harder (FO EVA-EVA?!). It's actually exactly like getting out of a toxic relationship. No one can take away the good times you had. The good times were also bait to hell.

You got to keep your eye on the prize, always remember your reasons for quitting. What helps me is knowing that if I smoke up again, the feeling of failure would be intensified by the high. I would not be happy.

This is just the beginning and there's so much more to figure out. More than a year ago I quit doing harder drugs like xanax, amfetamine, mdma, gbl, bipolar pussy, etc (depression of that 3 year period has left huge blanks in my memory. I was high and drunk when I took my uni exams). Now I never even think about those drugs. So it's only a matter of time til I forget weed.

Also, not to take all the credit - I've gotten this far this time because I've met the the right person to mentor me. All the effort has been mine, but having a smart healthy functioning person to look up to and advise you will really help navigate rough waters. You're not supposed to be in this alone. Especially when all your friends smoke (who are also my colleagues, fellow degenerate comedians, so I'm kind of stuck with those fucks). Be kind to yourself tho cuz that's who's doing all the heavy lifting.

I just quit smoking this past week and my withdrawals have been pretty bad, which I posted about earlier last night and got some great responses to—thank you (-:

Anyways, I was curious as to why some of you may have quit, and if it at all aligns as to why I did. For me, being productive and getting shit done is something I thrive off of, and for a while when I was smoking every night, I felt like I could still accomplish everything I wanted to.

Slowly but surely, though, my relationship with weed went from something that helped me relax at night, to a relationship that I was dependent on to make my reality (which is really by no means bad) better.

I gained maybe 10-15 pounds, self-esteem plummeted, and my drive to do the things that I KNOW make me feel great, diminished. It was like I wanted to be super driven in all of these aspects of life but someone had just sucked the energy out of me and I couldn’t get myself to do it. My mood was also terrible.

I do struggle with depression, and so my brain is already pretty vulnerable to the intake of a psychoactive drug, and I take full responsibility for knowing that and continuing to smoke, but I didn’t think it would end up impacting me in the way it did. 

Since I’ve quite, I’ve already seen a HUGE shift in my mood and attitude towards my daily life. I don’t get the munchies and I actually have the energy to go do the things I want. I still think weed is great and have nothing against it, I guess it just wasn’t sitting well with me and where I am in my life right now, and I have been able to accept that.

I hope you all find something similar in your journey of quitting, and would love to hear your stories if you’re willing to share.",3

2020-02-08 17:28:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f0yvsn/accidental_detox_euphoria/,Accidental Detox & Euphoria??,"I (33F) haven’t smoked in 5 days but it wasn’t by choice and now I’m seriously considering cutting out weed from my life. 

I’ve been smoking daily for about 5 years. I initially started using medicinally as I had a stomach surgery which made traditional painkillers intolerable as they created extreme stomach pain. CBD oil and vaping flowers was a godsend at the time. 

I’m fully recovered now and can certainly identify that now my usage is now to mask racing thoughts (perhaps anxiety? I’ve never been diagnosed but it’s very hard to shut down my brain from thinking about work), suppress recurring nightmares (family history of night terrors) and numb myself from PTSD (last year, my husband and I almost died from a gas leak in our apartment and I have flashbacks which cause me to tear up uncontrollably or experience panic attack like symptoms). 

While I do think weed has helped me remain a high functioning adult despite the PTSD (I just got a raise!!) in particular, I was starting to get frustrated with myself and my daily nighttime habit. I rarely hang out or initiate conversations with my friends. I frequently forget words mid-sentence and feel a sense that I can’t express myself as intelligently as I have been able to in the past. I always wait to do chores or tasks that would benefit me or my partner until the very last minute because for most of my non-work hours I am stoned and lazy being absorbed by trash TV or video games. I struggle with fleeting suicidal thoughts and pessimism. Despite this, I’m pretty good at pretending and people generally think of me as a happy extrovert and go-getter but it is just a facade. What gets me the most excited is coming home from work and getting stoned and hanging out no one aside from my husband. He does not smoke weed at all. He empathizes with my struggles and is super supportive but is probably enabling my bad behavior. 

I got the opportunity to go on a business trip outside of the US and didn’t bring my vape pen with me due to fears of getting caught with it by the TSA or Immigration officers. If it was a domestic flight, I would have totally risked it. I was dreading the insomnia but I have been able to do 2-3 day breaks in the past. However, lately my tolerance is extremely high. I could eat two small edible gummies and take multiple dab hits in one night and just barely get high. Recently I was waking up in the middle of night and needing to take vape pens hit to go back sleep. 

Well, it’s been 5 days without weed now and I’m definitely experiencing negative withdrawal symptoms like night sweats, shaky hands/clumsiness, headaches, intense nausea, insomnia, and one incident of my heart pounding like crazy during a stressful meeting. 

However, I also haven’t felt this happy and energetic in years. It feels like a fog has lifted — it may sound strange but its like I can feel my brain shooting off neurotransmitters that haven’t been used in ages. I’ve been coming up with so many new, creative ideas during this business trip, feel super upbeat despite being physically exhausted, and feel more motivated to speak with my friends via text/social media. Last night, I watched several YouTube videos from people who are former weed addicts and one person was funny and charismatic in how he was describing his situation — to be honest it wasn’t THAT funny but I started to laugh out loud and smile uncontrollably. I never tend to laugh at loud at media but the experience felt like I had murdered a demon that had been draining my emotions. Mentally, I feel like I’m on MDMA and feel motivated to get back to hobbies and interests that I know are beneficial to me rather than zoning out all evening. It’s absolute euphoria! I’m smiling at strangers, want to be helpful and polite, feel like everything’s going to be ok? I’m estranged from my parents and have actually felt a twinge of wanting to reconnect with them. 

I’m now on a flight back home and I’m so excited about these feelings I’m experiencing but can also feel an intense craving to smoke when I get home especially because of the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. 

Has anyone else felt this extreme euphoria during detox? I’m also fearful it’s a completely temporary side effect as my brain chemicals are rebounding from a lack of weed. Does anyone have any advice or insights? I think I want to stop completely and harness this energy and get back to old me that I was so proud of before I started smoking. 

tldr; I was a high tolerance weed addict (dabbing, high concentrate vape pens and edibles) who was “forced” to stop smoking b/c of an international business trip. I’m having pretty bad physical withdrawal symptoms but I feel energetic, happy and motivated. I haven’t felt this good mentally in years. Is this a temporary side effect? Has anyone else this uncanny feeling? Any advice for suppressing the negative withdrawal symptoms is appreciated.",2

I took my drug test earlier this week and passed! Here's the thing - I had a really stressful night last night for various reasons, and I **really** wanted to smoke, seeing as I'd already passed the test and ""deserved it."" I didn't smoke though - I could have, but chose not to. Turns out that was the smart decision, as I actually was notified that my sample was dilute and that I need to retest. 

I am so relieved that I made the choice to abstain. I would have lost this incredible opportunity and probably plunged straight into poverty to be honest, as I can't afford not to get this job. For me it's positive reinforcement to remain sober. I tell myself I should be completely clear-headed working in medicine anyway and I am doing GREAT.

2020-02-08 14:24:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f0wb2a/day_4_the_plateau/,"Day 4 (""The Plateau"")","So, I'm on Day 4 of being weed free for hopefully the rest of my life here on this planet!

Before I made the decision to quit, I cut down to only smoking the roaches I'd collected over the past months at night (about a roach or 2 a night).

Day 1 I relapsed, but I didn't reset my streak because I believe quitting weed is more about the JOURNEY along the way rather than the STREAK of not using. But Day 2, I didn't smoke weed that night.

I felt pretty great, surprisingly! Instead of getting stoned, I made a song that night and got in touch with another artist on him featuring on my song! And I woke up the next day feeling pretty energized and great! Day 3 was pretty good as-well!

So far, I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms yet as I did in my past attempts. I think after awhile of quitting off and on, and cutting down to a roach or two at night instead of smoking throughout the day, the quitting process has now become a breeze. But don't get me wrong, the path to this journey was not easy. I went through hell for the past 4 years quitting weed off and on, dealing with withdrawals, cravings, relapse.

But I do notice one slight feeling. The first 3 days I had a kind of natural burst of motivation and happiness from actually getting out of the habit loop of smoking. But today, I woke up just feeling normal. Not super energized, happy, or motivated. But just, meh. Not good, or bad. And just slightly irritated; but nothing intense enough to call it, ""withdrawals.""

So, I dub this the plateau effect. Last time I reached this plateau stage at around 2-3 weeks and started feeling great after a month. But since I've quit so many times, I've reached this stage on Day 4 now. So I'm hoping by 2-4 weeks in, I'm going to start feeling great again!

Sorry for the long post, but I hope this could in some way inform, inspire, or relate with you guys!

Have a great day and keep on the path! :)",5

I have been an avid smoker since i hit Gr. 11 in high-school. Although at the time, i was never able to see the negatives about consuming pot every single god damn day. I did finish high school and I've held a full time job for 8 years but I realize weed is my crutch and always will be.. Last year i managed to quit for 3 months, which is the longest i've ever gone. I was feeling great with little or no withdrawal symptoms except for the first 2 weeks. With my progress I started to think that maybe i could control my usage and build a healthy relationship with pot. I ordered a CBD strain and smoked that but ended up getting some free samples of other weed with actual THC. I told myself i would only smoke on weekends and at night. And here we are..

This second time around, i know not to cave in because i know it's my brain tricking me into smoking. I'm an addict. I realize there are some people who are able to have a healthy relationship with weed, but not me.

Incredible. We met this wonderful small shop owner and she joined us, him as a translator to help the language barrier. They taught me Russian sentences and I taught her English in return. Not going to lie I was disappointed when I woke up and found out “thank you” in Russian is not “grahhuul” GR-AH-WHO-UUL .

I quit for many reasons: I want a new job, I believe I am self medicating my depression, I'm spending too much money on it, it's holding me back from progressing as a human, it makes me lazy and fat. 

My dreams are back in Technicolor and aren't always pleasant. Before weed I was always a vivid dreamer. I wake up in the morning feeling awake and not drowsy. I'm more active and present with my spouse. Today I'm going to do some online classes to start learning SQL. 

Two Saturdays ago I would have waked and baked then spent the day stoned and playing on my phone. Instead I've already done a load of laundry, played with my dog, mixed up some henna to dye my hair later, and read a chapter of a new book and it's not even 9 am. 

I've also quit drinking. My therapist wants me to attend AA because she believes the local community is better for sobriety than this Reddit community. I disagree. My husband quit with me and 4 of my colleagues quit too. I have plenty local support.

It's not all sunshine and roses though. I'm not sure who I am if I'm not the party girl. It's going to be a journey to discover her that may not be an easy road. I'm pretty sure she's cooler than the 20-something girl I used to be before weed but also cooler than the stoner drunk I most recently was.

I had to leave my father's home due to stealing from him to buy pot. I was in jail on my 18th birthday. I spent the next few years homeless, in psych wards & county jails. My daily goal was to have a blunt, a pack of cigs & some form of carbonated drink before I went to sleep. I kept this mentality through a failed marriage, losing custody of my son, several great jobs & eventually ending up back where I started in jail. I met my wife 2 years ago. We're both potheads. We recently decided to quit together to benefit our family & our future. It's been 7 days. I am finally regaining my appetite, interest in things outside of my own mind & I'm finding it easier to show my wife affection. I know this is due to years of homelessness & incarceration. Way too many hours spent alone. My biggest complaint at the moment is sex drive, which is non-existent. Wondering if any other men have experienced this problem when quitting MJ. Pretty much a semi that doesn't last very long. I am hopeful. Life is better without pot. It is a drug because it alters how we think & feel. I personally become savagely dependent & have smoked a 1/4 ounce in one day several times. Hoping with this post I can find some common ground with someone that is hurting like me. Life does suck at times, but we all know adding pot to the mix only makes the questions harder to answer. If you are reading this & you are struggling, you are not alone.

Then I started again with the ride comments, arguing, causing fights, being unkind, losing my temper. Shit people around me are so incredibly tired of.

I've been improving no doubt, but it's been getting harder.

Wednesday I decided I needed three days off and took them. For the first time since Dec 27 ive wanted to get high, but haven't. I won't. But I've been substituting weed with food.

I'm not even hungry and I have been eating garbage like crazy, and been totally isolated for three days doing nothing. It's kind of fucked up.

I've heard of 'dry binging' where addicts basically stay sober but go hard on unhealthy shit. This has been a total dry bender. Haven't been going to the gym which has been so important for me.

I'm seeing it as a part of the process, but curious if anyone else has thoughts or experiences on this. Maybe it all comes step by step. Staying sober through three really rough days is an accomplishment for sure. I don't think I've made it past 6 or 7 weeks in ten years.

I joined Reddit today to be apart of this community per the suggestion of my fiancee. She's not a stoner, but I am and have been trying to quit for the past year since we got engaged. I started smoking nearly everyday since I was 18 in college, and I just turned 30 in January. I have been seeing a professional therapist since last February, which has been immensely helpful, and I did stop smoking for nearly two months last summer. However a really good friend of mine moved back to town in August and started working for a medical cannabis company where I live in Florida.

Since then I started hanging out with him more and smoking again, although I tried to keep it to just smoking while hanging out with him and not at home by myself. But recently it has turned really bad where I would hang out and smoke with him without telling my fiancee what I was up to. One night about three weeks ago it was pretty obvious to her that I was high and reeked of weed, and I did admit to her that I did smoke, but I was not upfront about it. This has raised major concerns with her since I lied about that and tried to hide it, so to her what else could I be trying to hide? And just to be clear I told her about my habit the day we met, and there is nothing else I am trying to hide from her besides me hanging out with my buddy and smoking weed.

So today marks day three being free of weed, but I was really struggling with cravings this afternoon. After work I really wanted to go hang out with my buddy and hang out, and I admitted this to her so that's what lead me to the Leaves subreddit. 
I am currently drinking a beer by myself at a local brewery and trying to remind myself of all the reasons why I don't want to smoke pot anymore. 

First of all I am getting married at the end of March, and don't want my habit to influence my marriage in a negative way. Second I would like to get a new job soon and I worry about being drug tested. Third, when I smoke I always over eat and let the munchies get the better of me. I'm already heavyset as it is and would like to lose weight, so this is no help. Finally I really want to prove to myself that I'm stronger than my addiction. I quit smoking cigarettes about five years ago, and have used other more addictive drugs than marijuana before but have never gotten hooked like I am with smoking weed and oil. 

Both my therapist and fiancee have suggested to stop hanging out with my good friend as he has been a bad influence, but I don't really have any other friends that I truly enjoy hanging out with. Part of that is on me because I haven't made an effort to make new friends, but still I have known my good friend for about six years and don't want to simply cut him out of my life. But man, has it been difficult to stop smoking with him. 

If you have made it this far into my post I appreciate you taking the time to read my story. And if anyone has any advice or suggestions on continuing the journey of not smoking pot I would love to hear it. I am glad to be apart of this community, as it makes me realize I'm not the only one struggling through this. There is so much more to life than getting high, I just know it!

Currently on day 38 clean and I'm finding it much more manageable than I did in the first month (that's not to say I'm finding it easy now. I'm not), however my biggest anxiety is work. I'm not sure if it's because I would ***ALWAYS*** work when blazed, getting high before, during and after, but now I'm second-guessing if it's even what I want to do going forward.

I studied a TV & Video Production degree at Uni, and right now my job involves shooting videos and taking photos of products, stores, customers and team members whilst also maintaining the eCommerce side of things, which I LOVED when I was high. I'd blaze up, listen to music and crack on with it, with the creatives juices flowing and the days would zoom past. Now I find myself dreading going to work, which pretty much ruins Sundays for me because they lead to Mondays, but I'm worried it's because either 1) ***this isn't the job for me*** or 2) ***this is life now. Like who even looks forward to going to work?***

I'm 22, live in my own flat and doing quite well financially, even more so now I'm not blazing, but since being sober I've dreaded the working day and finding it not necessarily boring or challenging, I just get so much anxiety about what the job entails and having to meet clients/work with other colleagues. 

I work from home 3/4 days a week, so when I have to go out and work my anxiety SHOOTS through the sky.

I wouldn't want to quit my job or move to another one that I really do end up hating, so I'm trying to stick it out for the remainder of the year because it pays well, it's in my area of ""expertise"" and I've got a good financial plan in place for the remainder of this year, with 2 holidays thrown into the mix for good measure.

Sorry for waffling on but if anyone has any advice or tips then that would be grand. I understand that work isn't the be all and end all, and I understand there's more to life; but what would **YOU** do in my situation? Thanks again and sending love to you all.",2

Instead of choosing to process my emotions healthily, so I got stoned Jan 26th-31st and then again from Feb 5th-present. I actually have enjoyed not being stoned: having more energy, sticking to a good diet, taking better care of my apartment. I wish I was back there again. 

So while I've failed, I'm not going to go into a nosedive. Usually, I feel so bad and ashamed about the failure that I lose another month to marijuana before I try to abstain again. Not this time: today is my last day.

I have smoked with a friend twice during that period, but I haven't acquired any more weed since I ran out a couple of weeks ago, and that's huge for me.  For the last few years I've been smoking almost constantly, even on work days.  Wake and bake, smoke at lunch, smoke on the way home, smoke before bed.  All done secretly behind my wife's back since she knows I have a problem (I've admitted as much to her).  

During the last year my attempts to quit have usually lasted about a day, so again, not re-upping for a few weeks is huge for me.  13 days ago my wife and I had a huge fight after she found my stash.  She made a scene right in front of our ten-year-old daughter, which was very traumatic for everyone involved.  Hearing ""Why would you do that??"" from your crying daughter who doesn't understand anything except for ""daddy is doing drugs"" is about as terrible as it sounds.  Of course, it was wrong of my wife to do that in front of the kid, and she has admitted as such, but I understand why she did it.  She wanted me to ""wake the fuck up"" and open my eyes to the fact that I'm jeopardizing everything in my life.  As terrible as it all was, it sorta worked.  I needed somebody to ""shake the fuck outta me"" and say wake the fuck up.

Finally, on to the point of my post.  Since I smoked like five times a day...five times a day I'm reminded of the fact that I'm not smoking anymore.  I think about it ALL THE TIME.  I try not to focus on it, since the more we focus on something the bigger it gets, but it's just so hard.  I'm very proud to have come this far, though, and I'm proud of you too.  We have to remember be as present as possible, avoiding useless and repetitive though patterns and replacing them with focus on what is happening this very second.",4

This week I was very happy and couldn't wait for Saturday - my 100th day being clean. It was a wild ride for me and I felt proud for once for a long while.

Then the test came back. Positive. And again I am the stoner who is the accused person of lying and I am heartbroken about this fact. I researched for a while and learned that some parts of weed can indeed be tested for up to 12 weeks. I had to do a second test and I am waiting for Wednesday to get the result. But after working so hard to quit smoking weed to get away from being ""the stoner"" and finally getting a step ahead in my life, this result was a punch in the stomach for me and I am not sure how I can work with that.

I am 100% sure when they test it a second time and do the quantity test they will clearly see that it is the rest of my year long abuse and that I am not a liar who just want to hide that he smoked 2 weeks beforehands.

I’m 31 years old and have been smoking since I was 15.  A good chunk of those years was practically every day when I was in college and most days for a few years afterwards.  The past couple years I’ve felt so zombified, from a combination of being an unmotivated stoner and a porn addicted cuck.  I don’t have much of a social life and have been single for almost 10 years now.  I’ve spent the better part of a year figuring out the best way to quit my porn addiction as I knew that was the bigger factor in making me feel so dulled.  I discovered a book called “The Easy Way To Quit Smoking” by Allen Carr.  It’s a guide on to how to quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey.  Only I found a version that was transcribed to quitting porn.  It helped me immensely and made me realize a couple major reasons why people trying to quit addictions relapse

1.  You feel like you are sacrificing something and have to struggle without it.  

A lot of people can be consciously aware to know they want to quit an addiction but they start it as an uphill battle.  “If I can just go X amount of time without it, I’ll start to feel better.”  It should be the other way around.  The minute you decide you’re done, you should be ELATED that you are finally FREE and can start living the life you want.  That’s where part 2 comes in.

2.  You think simply not doing the addiction will be enough.

You must realize that addictions are habits.  If you want to quit them, you must replace them with other healthier habits.  Once you decide you are done and free, start laying the foundation for what you want your new life to look like.  What have you always wanted to do that your addiction kept you from?  What are you escaping from? Start it now.  It can be however slowly or quickly you want, but start implementing new habits and activities towards your goal and new life vision.

3.  Whenever you feel the urge to relapse and start using again ask yourself this:  What purpose is this serving? Is this benefitting my life? Do I NEED to do this? Probably not.  It’s most likely not serving you at all, so why do it?

I’m going to admit that I haven’t gone very long without porn yet, only just over a month, but I’ll say this; that month after reading that book and adopting this new mindset has been the easiest time quitting yet.  I’ve decided to adopt the same mindset to quitting weed that I have to quitting porn.  That’s all I have to say, check out this book, it’s immensely powerful in such a simple way.

My perception of time had really slowed down and I was feeling free.

I ended up getting making it to 6 months on Feb 13, 2019. On that day I broke my chain.  I was feeling a sense of confidence that the weed could be handled.  In the month prior to cracking, I had been frustrated by my lack of productivity at work and home.  I reached out and got a therapist and adhd dr.  The day I started ritalin was the same day that I had relatives coming from out of town for a visit.  I got high that evening before we went out to dinner.  Regretted it moments after it hit me.

After a couple of weeks stumbling to quit again, I managed to get around 3 months of sober days in two 40ish day chunks. Then I went full trees and blew up my entire summer starting on July 4.  It's a damn slippery slope once the resolve has been breached!

I was feeling like utter garbage during that period.  I was riding my bike a ton while high and regretting most situations I found myself in on that regard. I was doing long distance drives high.  It was dumb and risky.  I was eating like a kid at Halloween. My home projects were taking more than twice as long as they should.  I was not journaling or looking at /r/leaves.

One afternoon I found myself high before a long drive again and was feeling shitty about that.  I sat down and put an entry in my journal on 9/26.  That was day 0 once again.  

Today I am working on day 134. Stoner since 1992",21

EVER.,"Day 2 again. I went on a date at two weeks sober and it was a HORRIBLE experience and mistake. We had no chemistry and the entire experience was the most awkward, painful, and ugly Trainwreck imaginable. We just stared at each other and made less than basic conversation before she made an excuse to dip out, then immediately texted me and said there was no chemistry. I didn't argue because my life is going nowhere. I don't know what I EVER liked about drugs, much less once loved about them because I'm certain she knew that I was strung-out and circling the drain mentally. I've done so many drugs that even when I stop the side effects now follow me about everywhere and people notice it more than I can. I can't even look people in the eyes properly.

&#x200B;

I wish I NEVER knew about drugs, that I was ignorant of this garbage. I wish we NEVER, EVER took a DARE class that explained to us how this seductive poison works because now my head and soul are filled with information from hell I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER ANYMORE!!! I can barely take care of myself, have achieved none of my social or financial goals, am overweight, suicidal and lack motivation for nearly anything. But I can get any drug I like delivered on demand like a pizza with no effort, I know how to get anything from weed to heroin to ibogaine to DMT without trying. WHERE IS THE PILL THAT ALLOWS ME TO ERASE THE LAST TEN YEARS?! If I put what I know about drugs into anything else, I would be a millionaire by now. Fuck drugs, I wish I had never bothered. They are only fun when you are a disciplined person because then you take it and leave it. Outside of my writing, I have no discipline and thats because my focus has been on getting loaded for nearly a decade.

&#x200B;

Words cannot express how much I hate myself right now. I hate how undisciplined I am in every area of my life besides writing, which feels like the only place I have self worth anymore. But thats not enough, I need discipline in all areas but I'm an impulse ridden psychotic who constantly flies off the handle for short term pleasure, just so I don't end my life, because even sober I am an addict and my behavior reflects it. I want a big fucking eraser, just a big eraser where I rub it on my forehead, and forget everything I learned about drugs but not the other lessons back to the age of 19. All I can do now is hope to rebuild the life I have shattered. God...please forgive me for my sins, this is not who I am. Maybe one day, I'll remember myself again.",7

Here is why.,"After nearly 10 years of being a romantic weedsmoking dreamer, I finally snapped out of it. Life was going to shit, I was not unhappy, depressed and got stoned everyday to numb myself from all the misery in my head. My life became a combination of several construction-sites and I called in sick every single day for years.

I stopped 3 months ago and have not thought a single time about doing it again and it all boils down to one single change in my mindset honestly.

I stopped defending weed as some kind of holy grail. I was the guy who would always put the blame on everything except the weed. Truth is !SPOILER ALERT! Weed is bad for me, like selfdestructive kind of bad. Weed did not cause the problems in my life, I know, but I abused it to ignore them for years.

Weed might have medicinal effects on some. But for a normal guy like me it just made me lose control. It is like being fat. You know you need to stop eating candy and fast food and start working out, though it still takes so long for one to work up the courage to finally do it.

Took me 10 years. I do not hate weed. I just accepted the fact that I need to quit for probably the rest of my life. So I just... stopped... And everything feels... better... and real. I want to change my life for the better now and I think this is what keeps me going so much. I ""quit"" so many times and always got back to the old routines and even further. Now I just want to extend my record more and more and more.

I see my friends now and feel bad for them. All still in denial, all still defending weed in front of themselves, not having the courage to acknowledge to themselves how selfdestructive their own behaviour has become.

Get behind the idea to leave that shit alone for the rest of your life. Get behind the idea that you can still accomplish so much with your life. Get behind the idea that you can be way more than you are right now. 

Go for it boys, you will not regret it.",31

You can’t quit weed without falling down a few times.

So, on Day 2 I actually made it through! When I came home late after work the smell of fresh dank weed from those in my family who smoke was so tempting. I thought I was ready to smoke.

But somehow, I managed to not smoke last night and ended up recording a song instead (I love to make music!)

That night was actually not so hard. I’d rather be sober and clear headed than deal with all the burdens of being high and the THC hangovers.

I cut down to only nightly smoking before this so I think that definitely helped abstaining last night easier. Once I got over the cravings, I actually enjoyed being sober.

I was up until 3:30 AM but after taking a melatonin I managed to knock out.

No intense dreams or any withdrawal symptoms just yet. If anything, I woke up feeling way more energized and optimistic this morning.

Another addiction of mine is caffeine and nicotine. I’m switching to no nicotine vape juice here shortly and wearing a patch.

As for the caffeine, I find that I don’t even crave it this morning because I’m naturally energized and awake; instead of waking up feeling dead and miserable after a long night of chain vaping, porn sessions, and bowl after bowl.

Feels good to wake up saying I can really do it; I can choose to not smoke. Gives me motivation.

We got this guys:)

This means a lot to me 💯❤️ even if it’s the first day waking up without having smoked last night!",3

I tried few times to stop but it was only impulsive and without real motivation. This time its really different feeling, i thought alot about pot. I dont enjoy being high anymore, its just a routine. When i started it was because it was fun and i can calm myself, you know, i dont need to explain. But now its neccessary for me only for ""being alive"" and i dont enjoy that feeling. When it dont give you feelings which were reasons for start smoke it why continue? I love your theory that weed isnt so bad but only its not for my brain, maybe im too sensitive or something. I hate my laziness, lack of interest and sleeping all day.
The problem is that first thing i did when i get up was going for smoke some.. now without weed im aggressive, i hate everyone and everything, i only want to be home and sleep but when i am home and have possibility to sleep, i cant fall asleep. Only thing i think about is smoking weed, i thought cravings are only for few hours but its whole days and i dont know what to do, how to solve it.

But now that I have this new job that I will start in a few weeks everything has changed and I can’t/won’t risk the loss of this job for a hit. I think I’m pretty heavily effected in a lot of areas by weed and so this is a huge change in my life.

All that and more, for such a short lived little rush of dopamine.


I gotta be honest here. I have been battling depression my whole adult life. During my most recent ""episode"", I was suicidal. I'm trying to pick myself up again. I'm getting help. And I'm trying something new this time. I'm going to do it without weed.

You don’t have a mental illness and you aren’t going crazy.

You will get EVERYTHING back. Your joy, love happiness. Mental stability.

I had the most horrendous withdrawals a person can have when quitting weed. Extreme muscle pain, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, looping thoughts, insomnia, feeling like you’re losing your mind.

Nobody believes you!

I don’t have a number of days off weed to tell you because it’s pretty much still in my system from the last time I smoked earlier today. I actually seemed to have put up barriers in my mind which tell me that I should only engage with a community like this once I’ve gotten ahold of myself. But now I realize it’s better to say something than nothing. 

If it isn’t obvious, I tend to get a little verbose when I’m high... so I’ll cut to the chase and say that I have no idea what I’m doing. I’m still able to function in my daily life but it is always a challenge that is brought about by the dependency on getting high in order to feel “right”. 

I don’t want to have that dependency anymore. I want to be free of what feels like chemical servitude. Awhile back I went through a bit of 12 step work but that whole methodology just didn’t cut it for me... yet going it alone doesn’t sound right.

I’m 18 years old and started smoking carts when I was 16 soon to be 17, and I would hit it almost every day multiple times. I never let myself do it at school or work, but the second I got home I would smoke myself to sleep, and I never felt good about it. Yesterday my best friend in the world, who goes to school in Florida, decided to come home from school, so I drove home from school (only about an hour away), to hangout with him and some friends. Whenever we would hangout, we’d smoke a bong or a bowl and play video games all night, and I expected the same. My friends and girlfriend show up and start hitting the bong, and I didn’t even crave it! We played Mario Party and I think I had more fun than I would’ve high! I’ve been sober for a little over two weeks now, i’ve tried before but never lasted more than a month, and I feel incredible! It’s tough when it’s most of what my friends do, and my girlfriend is high more often than not, but I don’t care! I’m sober and so ridiculously happy and proud of myself. I just wanted to make this post as sort of a record and to get it out there, I plan on talking to my parents tomorrow about all of this just to get it out there. Also, I’m down 15 pounds intermittent fasting, which I could never do on weed!

2020-02-07 00:38:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f061sf/one_potheads_experience_and_observations_with_12/,One pothead's experience and observations with 12 step groups,"Finding this group has inspired me to write a bit about my experiences as a dope fiend with 20 years off everything. Specifically I want to share some of my experiences and opinions about 12 step programs. This turned out longer than I expected, so here's the summary:

**tl;dr - 12 step programs are not for everyone. They work very well for certain kinds of addicts. Statistics show they are no more or less effective at getting people clean than any other approach. Nevertheless, the concept is solid and built on a principled foundation IMHO. The people who put that concept into action vary a lot; some will be the best people you will ever meet, and some are still as sick as the day they came into the rooms.**

I don't claim to be anything more than a recovered pothead. I started smoking weed in 1971, at the age of 13. I discovered the rooms of Marijuana Anonymous in 1998, after I had proven to myself that ""I can stop smoking weed anytime I want to, I just don't want to"" was a lie. I put down weed for good at 40, but it took me a year or so of the ""alcohol maintenance program"" to realize sobriety meant **total** abstinence for me.

I didn't get well immediately, but I did three things right to start with: I attended meetings, I didn't pick up in between meetings, and I got a sponsor right away. But I still thought I knew better than the group of recovered addicts whose stories I identified with from the start.

Long story short, I got stuck on one of the early steps for a few years. But I watched others come in, work the program as written, and get better. It took a ""step nazi"" sponsor to pull me aside and show me how to do it right. That made a huge difference for me.

I put in a fair bit of service work in MA and Alcoholics Anonymous over the years, and I don't regret any of it. Today, I've stepped back from the meetings for the most part. I hold no ill will towards the programs, I have just found that I don't need to stay involved at the level I was. I still feel right at home any time I step into a meeting room - of **any** 12 step program.

So, some observations about my time in the programs:

* Working a 12 step program in and of itself will not harm most people. (I used to believe no one would be harmed, but a close friend with complex PTSD told me they were triggered by the things said in meetings.) I believe the Steps, *if properly practiced,* cannot cause harm to the recovering addict. (Remember, personal opinion, YMMV.)
* The people you meet in the rooms are all over the place, from every social strata, from teenagers to old farts like me, from the executive suites to the streets. The only thing they have in common is they found they couldn't stop using or drinking on their own.
* There are some very good people in these programs. Off the top of my head I can name at least a dozen people I've met in the rooms to whom I would literally trust my life. These people are still human, and still make mistakes; but they actively seek to learn from those mistakes on a daily basis. If you find these people, stick with them.
* There are some very manipulative, sociopathic, and/or judgmental people in the programs too. And some of them have a lot of ""clean"" time. Sadly, some of those are very active in outreach in the recovery clinics and jails. (But the good ones also participate in outreach.) There's a particular kind of 12-stepper who insists that everyone must go through exactly the same tribulations and hardships they did decades ago, or ""they're not really working The Program and they're doomed to fail.""
* It can be difficult for the newcomer to the rooms to distinguish the good people from the bad ones. That is one of the unfortunate realities of any recovery program, not just 12 step. The person who talks a good game might be full of shit, while the quiet one in the corner just might be the one who saves your life.
* The idea of one addict helping another is a cornerstone of the 12 step philosophy, and transcends whatever flaws the 12 step programs themselves may have. Hearing your story from the mouth of someone you've never met before is incredibly powerful. Hearing someone with a lot of time in recovery tell you that they went through the same doubts and troubles you're going through right now is inspirational. Helping another addict get clean and seeing the light come back in their eyes is a better high than any I've ever bought. **This is true of any program where addicts help each other recover. It is not unique to 12 step.** But it is without a doubt one of the keys to the 12 step programs.
* Respect is earned, not given, in the rooms. Humility, being there for other addicts, and the ability to speak in front of the group about one's own failings - and how they were overcome - is what earns that respect. The humility comes from knowing they got there the same way you did, out of desperation, and knowing that they're literally only an arm's length from falling back into addiction.
* I dislike the habit many 12 step groups have of using particular religious readings (e.g. ""The Lord's Prayer,"" which is a popular way to end meetings). AA's founders came from a particular Christian sect, and since ""Bill W. and Dr. Bob could never have been wrong,"" that influence pervades AA, no matter the words of the preamble claiming the program is not religious. I have personally talked to people for whom the mention of ""God"" in the readings of the Steps and Traditions of MA - which is not as strongly tied to the Christian heritage - drove them out. This is part of why I don't attend meetings these days.
* Under the Traditions, each group is independent and autonomous, so long as they are focused on helping the addict who still suffers. Formats and group dynamics vary all over the place. So when someone says, ""Try a group, and if you don't like it, look for another one,"" they're giving solid advice.
* 12 steppers often tell themselves their way is the only way to get clean. Even Bill W. didn't say that in the original (1935) edition of AA's Big Book, but many believe it nonetheless. I used to believe that myself, until I discovered several good friends had gotten clean on their own, without any program. Statistics show that participants in 12 step programs have about the same chance as any other method of staying clean over a long period.
* A lot of courts will send someone charged with a drug-related crime to a 12 step group. For me, the **only** good thing about this is introducing the program to someone who wouldn't have come in the door without the ""nudge from the judge."" It's been my experience that very few of them stay. And many who pass through consider it a violation of the constitutional separation of church and state. (See the paragraph about religion above. They're not wrong IMHO.) I also see it as the state (or county, etc.) palming off their duty to help get people clean onto the groups, at no cost to the government but some cost in time (and possibly disruption) to the group.
* AA in particular has a strong tradition of ""It was good enough for Bill W. and Dr. Bob, why change it?"" There's no shortage of quotes from the Big Book and the 12 & 12 that sound horribly bigoted today. The first part of the Big Book is exactly as Bill Wilson wrote it in 1935. But times change.
* That said, there is a tremendous amount of wisdom to be gleaned from official literature of 12 step programs. As is often said, ""Take what works for you, and leave the rest."" AA's Steps were laid down in 1935, with influences going back millennia. The Traditions came about in the 1950s, and are distilled from the lessons learned in trying to manage a phenomenon that mushroomed in popularity from the first dozens of AA'ers to hundreds of thousands even in the early '50s. That is hard-won wisdom.
* I'll close with this: I have had to learn to suspend judgment on other people. It's not my place to tell anyone how to recover from addiction. People I thought would never get clean have a decade or more under their belts now. People I thought were set for life have come crawling back into the rooms with their tail between their legs.

If you've been struggling with staying clean, but haven't tried a 12 step program, I suggest you give it an honest try. If it doesn't work, try something else. But please don't give up.

I’m 27. I have 3 small boys. I take care of them pretty much alone. I work 40 hours, cook, clean, yell lol ... u get the point. Anyways, weed is like the ONLY outlet I feel like I have to release and relieve stress. I don’t go anywhere, I have like 2 friends that I barely ever talk to. I am an introvert, socially awkward, just different I guess. 

Why I’m quitting:

- I’m tired of being nervous and trying to make sure the temp of someone else’s pee stays right while trying to get a new job lol

- With 3 kids u can imagaine... I need my money. And I’m blowing it. On being high. Tf 😒

- I don’t like my kids to ever smell it. I put in clear eyes because my eyes get bloodshot off of like 2 puffs. 😄 I feel guilty when I’m high around them. I smoke in my room, only while they are sleep. I feel bad about that too. 😂

- I hate the fact that I have tried to quit so many times and keep failing. I feel weak for depending on a substance that costs money just to endure the day and life’s troubles. It actually may be affecting my self esteem now that I think about it. 🤔 

Whenever I try to quit 24 hours is the longest I’ve gone. I smoke 3-4 times a day. I’ve been trying “hard” since Jan 1st. 😁 And every weekend I’m like “okay, this is the last weekend.”  Then Monday comes and I’m like UGH I totally hate going to work. So I need weed. To distract me from life.” in so many words 😂 but seriously, I’m glad I found this. We’re all just human. And we might not get it right on the 1 try. Or the 100th. 🙃 But if we take this serious and just face and acknowledge having to deal with life and the emotions and the stress, without having to smoke to endure it, and change our MINDSET., the rest will follow. ❤️ Don’t beat yourself up. Weed does not control us. We don’t NEED it. One day at a time I guess. 😉",15

I'm 25 years old and I've been smoking cannabis from the age of 16-23, quit for roughly a year and then I've been back on it ever since until 3 days ago.

The last few times I smoked I experienced major anxiety/panic attacks and actually took myself to A&E on more than one occasion over the past few weeks  as I feared I was dieing.

I decided enough was enough and I've now not smoked for 3 days, but the anxiety (maybe?) is killing me. I got a bad chest around the time I stopped smoking and the doctor says it's a upper respiratory tract infection, he checked my oxygen levels, pulse, temperature and listened to my chest with a stephoscope and said everything seemed fine, however I've convinced myself it's something much more serious like cancer.

I've been having on and off episodes off panic and anxiety the past few days now where I feel like I cannot breathe(nose is blocked) , feel dizzy, heart races, my chest feels full of mucus which I cannot clear and I feel generally tired all the time. It usually seems to get worse at night, and I actually dreaded trying to sleep at night for the past few days.
I've also been off work for this whole week due to the symptona which is causing me money worries.
I never experienced anything like this in my life before and it's scaring me so much, I'd give anything to feel normal again.
I will never touch cannabis or even a cigarette again in my life, what's the matter with me :(
Is it the respiratory infection, is it anxiety from withdrawals or is there something seriously wrong with me, should I go to A and E again because I've convinced myself it's cancer.
My mind is racing and I'm so worried, I don't know what to do, will this pass?
Please give me some advice and maybe experiences anyone else has encountered which is maybe similar.
Kind regards and TIA",3

""Why are you even quitting? Weed doesnt make you feel bad.""
""Why should you quit? Arent you just doing it for other people?""
""Smoking just this once cant hurt.""
It was the same with nicotine.
If anything, nicotine was easier to quit. The ""why"" was right in front of me. I could simply look up that day's news and find myriad new articles about the harmful effects of e-cigarretes.

I'm quitting because I cant rely on weed.
Im quitting because I cant remember what sobriety is like.
I'm quitting because I deserve a better life than the one I've given myself.
I'm quitting because smoking just once is exactly how I got into this mess. Four and a half years later, and I'm still cleaning it up.

It makes life miserable, I overthink everything and its hard to say its just the weed because it feels so real and attacks things that gave me genuine anxiety when it happened initially. 

Additionally I feel like I am in a dream all the time, unless I drink a shitload of coffee but then that makes the anxiety worse. Working out helps with the anxiety but then I feel high after and cloudy in the head. Energy is also down, my brain is exhausted from beating topics to death and making myself constantly worry.

I came across an article about binge eating where the author says that bingeing is a form of self abandonment in those moments of painful feelings. And the only way back from it is to acknowledge the pain and unmet needs and then do acts of self care. When we care for ourselves we affirm “I am here. I am with myself and I acknowledge my own needs and pain and I am worthy of meeting them.”
I’m a bit further along with recovering from my food issues and I had been thinking things along these lines already but this really solidified it for me. 

I was telling my husband about this article and then he said something really profound to me. “All addictions are like that. You used weed to abandon yourself in moments of pain too. And now you’re caring for yourself with meditation and exercise and that’s why this quit is successful.” 💡💡 

SO. In that moment where your emptiness, your pain, your depression or anxiety (whatever you’re trying to self medicate) feels the most overwhelming - take a moment to lean into that pain and express it. Acknowledge your pain and unmet need. Then do an act of self care. Whether that’s preparing yourself a simple nourishing meal, calling a friend, taking a walk, spending time in nature or with a pet, meditating, journaling out your feelings or taking a shower - do some form of healthy self care. The more you acknowledge your needs and care for yourself the less need you will feel to abandon yourself and the less you will crave a substance that harms you. 

I hope this helps someone else like I know it helps me.

I will not smoke for a month or two. and then I'll smoke all day every day for a month and the cycle repeats. I have a honeymoon phase every time I start or stop of about 2 weeks where life is great; I'm content, productive, and hopeful. 

If I'm stopping weed even with the withdrawal, I feel great for a couple of weeks, then I slowly fall into this state of what feels like I imagine speed to be. I have a thousand thoughts at once, I can't sit still, I can't shut up, I can't focus on any one thing and I have so many things I need to do or want to do that I do none like I just freeze up and stare into nothingness or pace around doing jack shit after about a month or two I start smoking again. 

When I start to smoke weed again, I feel great again, the same way I do when I stop but only for a couple of weeks.  I can get a little bit done but after a month or so I get depressed and paranoid, my productivity goes down and I will quit, resetting the cycle. 

I've never found help in therapy and I'm really scared of taking pharmaceuticals but I'm nearly 30 and shit just isn't panning out for me in any way, I can't find a therapist right now and really doubt I'll find relief as they've never helped in the past. I know I'm self-medicating something but as I get older it's getting more pronounced. I quit weed for 2 years when I was younger and wound up suicidal on and off which I don't want to go back to.

In order to do something different, we must do things differently. Congratulations to us that have and/or are leaving pot behind. It's very important to know why you have chosen to leave an addiction behind, and it is literally one day at a time. Forever is a very long time and sometimes for me ""never"" can get a bit overwhelming. What helps me is to remind myself that I am focused on today and let tomorrow come and I'll deal with tomorrow - tomorrow. Today I am choosing not to live in my past.

I listen to subliminal tapes as hypnosis style and have affirmations that work pretty well for me and maybe they will for you, too. Reading books, and going to therapy, dare I say - self-discovery is critical.  It's very important to know and understand why we smoke/d weed. 

Here is a list of affirmations that I have modified for me, many of which I modified from Thomas Hall's YouTube videos. Maybe it will work a bit for you. You might want to print your version and carry it with you. Or send it to yourself in an email. It's in my email, which is on my phone, which we all usually carry with us. That way it will always be with you to read.   Focus on today. No matter what you are feeling - it will pass. Be kind to yourself.

I've already learned so much about the positives of being sober.

My husband and I decided to quit, mainly for financial reasons, but now I feel like it's a good decision for our health as well. We stopped about 3 days ago now, and I already feel like I have a clearer mind, and I have also been exercising to keep myself busy.

My husband is having a harder time dealing with no green. He says that it helped with boredom and maybe depression (he's never expressed this depression to me before). He is a gamer and DM for our dnd group, so he has his hobbies and stays busy most of the time, so it's not like he has nothing to do.  I sent him some links, including one of the top posts on this sub for him to read to maybe help him see the benefits to being sober. I'm not very good at being a motivational speaker, but I also talked to him about this.  He just doesn't really seem interested, and has been craving to smoke.  How can I help him, and have this be a positive experience for us?

A little more info about us: Been together since high school, married for 2 years now. Been smoking since high school, but almost daily for the last 4ish years. We own a house, and have a dog and two cats, no children. We both work Mon-Fri. In debt (mostly school loans), which is why we made the decision to stop spending money on the good green.

I also have a lot of social anxiety so I thought it would help with that as well. Yet I continued to drink. When I am completely sober I feel a lot of tension and like I cant really relax. I usually just take a sip of whiskey when i get home from work to unwind and more on weekends (not blackout but damn close). after a month my anxiety is as bad as ever and i dont feel all that different. if anything i feel more  like i am following in the footsteps of my parents who are both alcoholics.

i'm starting to realize i was happiest when i was just smoking flower. i am seriously considering limiting my smoking to weekends only and even then just one or two bowls and completely cutting alcohol out of my routine. i never felt like weed was killing me but getting more tolerant of alcohol has made me realize just how much of a slippery slope it is.",7

You go casually about your day, doing your thing and suddenly.... that demon is back. In one snap of a finger, you suddenly think about smoking some fat bong rips, spliffs...whatever. You suddenly feel anxiety because you cant get your fix and it stresses you out. 

Only thing you gotta do is shift your mind to whatever else. And I mean whatever. Even better is start doing some activity as soon as you get those feelings. Think about some ideas, call your friend, go take a cold shower (best imo, but I am not on that level yet) or whatever comes to your mind. It will stop in no time. 

It is surprising how one simple thought can break your Withdrawal/Craving.

Thats it. The most important thing to remember is that you cant feed that demon by thinking about weed, rolling, smoking... this will just feed that anxiety. Keep that in mind.

In fact I can hardly imagine a day worse than today was without some external circumstance causing it.  My mental state is an absolute wreck.  This is the deepest depression I've ever felt.  It's hard for me to be excited about anything.  All I have is hope that it won't always be this way.  It feels as though the entire three years of emotions I numbed with weed is all pouring out on me at once and then some.  My extremely stressful is making the situation much, much worse than it otherwise would be.  I had a total breakdown at one point today.  I'm not sure how much more of this I can handle.

Is anybody else finding that week #4 to be exceptionally rough?",3

I just thought I would share my personal experience so far. I have been a daily smoker since 18 and it is the 5th time I've tried quitting. I don't know why but this time feels different, and I actually want to quit. Using bud to self medicate my depression and my insecurities is just not working anymore. Who knows how much permanent damage I have done to my relationships with family and previous friends. This is my chance to turn things around and find out who I really am and what drives me.  

Its tough having no non-stoner friends and even my girlfriend eats edibles daily. Four months ago she got diagnosed with vaping related lung disease. This was probably the most eye opening experience of my life and made me realize just how serious the long term negative effects can be. Although vaping was a terrible idea looking back it just shows how quickly life can change. I would never ask her to change her lifestyle just to fit my desire to quit, and knowing how much she has gone through lately I think she ""needs"" it now more than ever.

And by 'deal' I mean smoke, have yet more anxiety about it, decide to quit, and then smoke the very next day.

I haven't smoked at all this decade and I have more motivation than I have ever had before to work on my life. I'm a high school student currently in the college admissions process; the resulting stress of which was one of the biggest things I tried to avoid with pot. 

Today, my mom noted to me how I seem like a totally different person. Researching schools, practicing SAT, reaching out to different connections were all things I did as if forced to at gunpoint when smoking. I hated it and just did it to check a box. Now, I am doing all those things completely on my own. They still bring me anxiety but I can handle it and I am so, so proud of myself.

I am a 36 year old female who lives in Florida and has 2 weeks of no smoking weed.  I am completely sober in fact as I quit drinking over 3 years ago and have been smoking just a bowl or two a day before these past two weeks for 16 years.  I had breaks in the past where I'd quit for a day or two but not like this.  Anyways,  I quit because I was suffering from pollen allergies and decided to keep going because although I am able to make a living with my own cleaning business,  I don't want to keep doing this work for the rest of my life as my body hurts and also it gets really tedious and boring.  The pay is good and not working with or for others is good too. So in order to get more clarity I quit weed, yep.   I have a Bachelors degree in English but I just have never figured out what I want to be when I grow up.  I'm a scatter brain who is gifted in writing, painting, jewelry making, and playing guitar, although none of these things get much notice and I've been told my whole life that it won't amount to much.  So yes, why not get high? Makes everything feel better.  In these past two weeks I am on and off again agitated, having nightmares, forgetful, and feel like even more of scatter brain than before.  I will say that my body feels less stiff and my lungs feel good.  I am playing more guitar but other than that I just feel kind of depressed and like overall a big, BLAH.

I was anxious before bed, even after months sober, it was intense how it still had a hold on me, even without smoking it. I woke up in the morning with a strong thought. Why do I need to smoke? What is the special occasion? I used to use it for creativity and to relax. Since I quit my productivity and creativity have gone up. I took up way better habits to exercise that help me relax. After my morning coffee I was able to get rid of the free weed.

Yes right now there is a part of me that regrets it, like who gets rid of free weed? But I'm ok with that regret. It's the cravings talking. If you are on a streak and get super tempted, just say let me sleep on it. Let me see how I feel in the morning about it.",21

Even though I lead a good career, have my own apartment, have an amazing dog and a really supportive family (who know about my habit and why I do it, but hope I can cut back), I do find that it occupies a lot of my mind and has made me so much less productive in my free time. I'm just chasing my next endorphin rush and embrace relaxing and being lazy when I can more than ever.

I started smoking for the first time 2 years ago and once I learned how to roll 6 months later, that was it. I smoked pretty much every day since then. It has been a GODSEND for my anxiety disorder and no part of me regrets taking that last 2 years to smoke through some serious PTSD and depression. It really let my mind slow down after racing for 27 years straight, and was a huge help while I tackled all of my issues and trauma in therapy and did a lot of hard internal work.

But now, I'm ready to get back to my energetic, go-getter state, and I'm really having a hard time kicking the habit. When I don't microdose, I have a heaviness in my chest, a lump in my throat, a knot in my stomach, and just feel uneasy because my anxiety increases.

So I have of course quit several times before and the pattern is without failure, always repeating. I am fully aware that my happiness today is complete bogus. I am simply happy just because I still can smoke, today.

I fear for tomorrow, friends. My mind will not get to run away anymore, it will have to face all the demons.

The worst feeling is the realization of all the things that you have been pushing aside by smoking daily, in a destructive environment (I am not saying that everyone suffers from day-smoking). You know that now you have to deal with them, and feel their consequences.

By this point im down to my last joint.

I am happy, excited, worried and anxious. 

Once more I will turn to spirituality for support. It has helped me in so many other ways. Weed has just always been working my mind in its favor, making me believe that there is nothing to fix. I will just have to travel inwards, dig deep into my conciousness and stop whatever it is that is making a fool out of me.

This is my first post on the subreddit and I wanted to talk about how I escaped my addiction to weed. I started smoking at 17. It started off slow but the time inbetween grew shorter and shorter until I was doing it everyday. I had that usual slight discomfort questioning whether I really had an addiction or not but I drowned that with excuses and a lot of marijuana. But after a year of getting blitzkrieged every day I ran out of money and had no income.

I started stealing from my parents. Finding any money I could around the house to stay lit. Eventually my parents found out and the money dried up. 1 night I took what I knew would be my final hit and went to sleep. There was a girl who said she would support me quitting, we weren't dating but we were both attracted to each other, she had never got high. 

The first morning of sobriety I was looking for the high of weed to escape responsibility as soon as I felt my eyes open. And the next few days was spent with me trying to suppress this urge or frantically looking in places for money or opening my weed storage for the 7 time that hour knowing nothing was in there.

Eventually urges diminished and after about 2 months I wasnt even tempted anymore. 

But on my next pay day with was 4 months after sobriety i got high again and for the past week i slipped into old habits and got stoned all the time. Today will be my first day sober and i forgot that sobriety isnt even that bad, I'm always just scared to quit in the first place. Weed makes you forget, so build a life you want to remember brothers. I hope you found this helpful guys.

The worse part is that every time I attempt to quit and fail I loose a little bit of the motivation to quit, on top of this, the thought of failing to quit again becomes ever more painful when I consider how hard I have tried in the past and failed. 

My relationship with weed is a deep and complication one. Without trying to sound arrogant, despite being a stoner I am usually fairly hard working and able. Im a final year student at a red brick uni taking astrophysics and I also exercise fairly regular and have little trouble securing jobs. 
... I have known for a while I have a very unhealthy relationship with weed that has descended into a weekly cycle of taking almost 3 whole days off to smoke on my own in my room, then a mental breakdown a few days later, followed by a few days of hard study and going to the gym. At which point I then feel pleased with myself and like I deserve some pot. And so the cycle continues. 

I originally intended to stop before my exam period (ending Tommorow) but ended up deciding to not quit untill after so that my brain wasn't completey foggy from withdrawal symptoms (I get really bad ones) ... 

I know weed has made me introverted and has made my eyes dark and unhealthy looking... I think my main problem is feeling less bad a few days after stopping and then taking it as a sign I can smoke again... 

Recently I have had a feeling that although I have got to uni and (almost) finished a degree my addition will destroy me badly soon... I am so desperate to stop and will give my everything to it this time. 
It was so nice discovering the thread and seeing people with the same crazy feelings on weed and difficulties trying to quit... 
I've been smoking fairly regularly since 15 and certainly every day since 17/18... I am now 20 and need to leave this behind me and face the future without the numbing daze that weed brings. 

I could say far more about why I want to quit but it's fairly regularly covered by others in the thread so I'll leave it there for my introduction

A few things that have been reoccurring thoughts over the last month

1) How important nights of sober sleep are
- I undervalued how nice it is to wake up each morning feeling relatively the same and actually waking up refreshed is a feeling money cant buy. 
- I had to reset my whole sleeping routine and try and get myself into a habit of calling time when I needed sleep and put the phone down

2) How my attention and general willpower to get mundane tasks done. 
- There is always parts of general life that can be just a boring requirement, but setting small tasks at the start of the day or the night before make a huge difference to the week, which has left me feeling a little more accomplished. 

I feel good and steady today, a complete change to how i was feeling over a month ago, this sub has played a huge role in keeping me on the path, Hope you are all doing well this week!

I usually struggle alone with this type of thing but I saw this community and I just wanted to give a voice to what I'm going through and what I'm feeling in the hope of helping me deal with this awful withdrawal.

Just for background -- I was vaping bud every night for the last 8 months or so to help me with temporary nerve damage that is thankfully healing. I decided to stop, thinking that -- like before -- I'd struggle to sleep for a while but that's it. Jesus *Christ* was I wrong. Instead, this is what I'm going through:

* Insomnia
* Nausea
* Stomach cramps
* Cold sweats
* A range of emotional swings (Anger, laughter, sadness, shame)
* Cough
* Runny nose
* Headache

I'm around 5 days in and it's rough guys. I don't feel the need to relapse and use again but it really makes me not want to go near this stuff ever again. What helps me is the fact that I know it's going to come to an end but it's just going to take time.

Thanks for reading; I really appreciate it. If you feel you can offer any support, advice or anything else, feel free to do so. I just feel that there is real power in doing this with others, as opposed to suffering alone.",12

But yesterday was Day 1 and I completed it, had 4 beers in the night to take away the anxiety and racing thought about not being able to sleep.  So took a sleeping aid tablet, slept right the way through, but already this morning I'm worrying about how to sleep tonight, the racing thoughts the sweats. It's the split second thought in my head which I think to myself one won't hurt but then tomorrow I will be in an instant regret. 

I enjoy everything outdoors sports hiking just being out there and free, so I keep active and and listen to podcasts to keep the brain functioning properly, I'm not one of those stoners who sit and watch Netflix all day I'm out there climbing mountains and chasing tail.   

I've done it before so I know I can do it again, I've never spoke about my struggles to anyone it's like my own little program to get off the weed, 4 beers and a sleeping tablet for the first night but that's not great for my mental health, Any tips or advice would really mean a lot guys.

**The Pro’s I’ve experienced so far**

* My sleep has steadily gotten better, and my dreams are back in full swing. 

* Still saving more money towards important things.

* My social interactions are better and I’m more witty. 

* Although my short term is still shitty, I’m starting to remember things from my past that I thought were long forgotten. 

* My overall mood is more stable, rather than manic cycling that weed exacerbated. 

* My productivity is better, and I can last longer in the gym and my workouts are more focused

* I’m eating healthier and drinking more water

**Cons so far**

* Brain fog, Brain Fog, **BRAIN FOG**

* I still feel  disassociated/derealized

* Anxiety comes and goes , but still an issue

* I get irritated easier

* I’m always sleepy

* My sex drive is no bueno 


Still going strong at 3 weeks (22 days), and I would like anyone who has experienced my cons to offer some advice or timeline on how long it takes to dissipate. I should be getting a new job as soon as I can test negative for THC, which is also a pro Thanks",1

Unacceptable behavior.
I’m lucky to have such an understanding family on my side and I know they will forgive me no matter what but still I really want to change my behavior.

I’ve quit substance abuse, now its time to stop vocally abusing my loved ones. Worst part is, I don’t even realize it at the time, my backwards thinking convinces me I am 

1. The victim or 

2. Being ganged up on

Maybe that was true in the past but tonight was not the case. And it took a family conversation/meeting for me to realize. 

My family vocalized their regrets and apologies explaining how they haven’t been perfect either except I can’t decide if it’s true or they were trying to make me feel not alone. 

I’ve been such a burden to my family for so many years now. Because of weed. Never had any issues like this before. In weeds defense I happened to pick it up right around puberty so hormones could be a factor. But I know weed plays a major role.

I just feel like shit right now. And I feel like I should disappear so my family can be normal again, but my gut tells me it’s not true.

Anyone relate to even a single part of this? 

I’m working on changing my behavior and life every single day; however, tomorrow is a special one. I swear to not have another meltdown like tonight. 


Atleast for a while.


And if I do, I swear it won’t be unprovoked and I will try my best to not take it out on those who love me most. Signed,

A week ago my stoner brain had me tricked into thinking this challenge was impossible, that I'd only fail, that I shouldn't try.   

But I feel... better.  Better than I did then.  I feel more hopeful, and proud of initiating change and in spite of my weirdly roaring stomach, crazy dreams and impossibly sleepless nights, I feel oddly content.   The obsession with sparking up seems to have disappeared.  Now its more of a background thought.  Still there, but farther away.  

If you're like me and still smoking, dwelling on negativity and self loathing over the wasted money and wasted years and poor decisions as a result of the habit, I just want you to know that it was worth it. Even looking back one week I feel like a different person.  And while it seemed so monumentally overwhelming at the time, now I can't believe it took me this long to just stop.  

Can you believe I actually had myself convinced I had chronic fatigue syndrome, or lyme disease, or any other disorder other than simply cannabis addiction?  I smoked so much indica it's amazing I managed to half ass my way 30hrs a week at work for the last year. 

In one week I feel reinvigorated and blessed.  Ready to do more and be challenged.  I might even pull off a forty next week, wouldn't that be something?  My wallet will thank me.  

Don't procrastinate on this, if it's really something you want.   The sooner the better.  I tried to prepare myself to quit but in the end that was just my addiction talking.   Do it now, because you can, and will, be free.

I'm 17 right now, soon to be 18. I started smoking around 13 and started smoking daily around 14. At first, I was naive of the long-term effects. I'm sure everybody here had that honeymoon phase with weed where it felt like being in love with someone almost. And then, of course, the toxic relationship begins..

Around 15, I knew I had to quit because I saw how marijuana was amplifying my depression over time. I had no friends, I was failing out of highschool as a freshmen, and I was very unhappy with my lack of drive or motivation to chase my very ambitious dreams. Weed didn't turn me into a fiend who completely destroyed his life. But it did fuel to the fire of depression and laziness.

So around 16 was when I started realizing, ""Woah, I need to quit smoking weed and get myself together in life."" I always knew I could change my ways even if I was smoking weed, but somehow I let my addiction prevent me mentally from being productive, happy, and responsible.

It didn't help that some of my family, all of my friends, and the girl I fell in love with (although still a great person) all were pretty much daily smokers.

But, since being 17, I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, got away from the fake toxic friends, and am back to being a lonely stoner again. But I've managed to quit in the past! Even though only 30 days, those 30 days were the best days of my life since I started smoking weed. And I made it 2, 3 weeks a few times as-well these past few months. And thankfully, I'm now soon to graduate Highschool and head off to college while pursuing my passion with music! I don't really know how I did it, but I'm just barely managing to go into that second part of my life and I'm proud I was able to pull through this year through all the brain fog and haze weed has put me in.

Since I feel like this subreddit heavily motivates me if I stay active on here, I am going to make a post for every single day I'm sober. The awesome thing is that I can share my journey with you guys and I'm grateful for that!

So, this marks Day 0. Tomorrow morning, I will plan to go cold turkey. The past 2 months I've only been smoking at night. And surprisingly, cold turkey is always the way that works best for me. I can't moderate, so cutting down always fails. I get a little bit depressed for the first week or two, and it seems to be a breeze from there on. I realize what made me fail was mostly my toxic friends in life, so I've cut them out. So I'm happy being lonely for now ahaha. If it means I'm sober, that makes me happy.

My motivation is shot and I never feel like doing anything. I was laid off work in Early August of 2019 and haven't been able to find employment since. 

As an almost 25yo male, I would rather be helping out other people with my time rather than smoking marijuana masturbating and eating Cheetos counting as my plans.

It seems that the 2 year milestone really hit me. I don't feel the desire anymore.

I won't even use the word cravings because I hardly remember what that is.

Don't get me wrong, I was the supreme addict, smoked for 20 years. I had hardcore cravings and withdrawals when trying to quit, which I did a hundred times over and over.

And even so, it all passed. Withdrawals pass. The brain heals itself. Life is possible without weed, and much much better. At least for me anyway.

People can smoke in front of me and I feel nothing. I don't tease or challenge myself, I don't allow silly thoughts. I'm just done with it, I don't feel any desire. I don't judge also. I don't care, really.

Keep going friend. It will be okay. Hang in there. You will feel brand new in due time.",36

I'm an almost 40yo breadwinning mom of two (4 and 1yo) with a big job title. I wake up at 4:45am (after usually being awake an hour or two during the night with baby) and go until 9pm, when I finally get to read a few pages of a book before passing out. Classic high functioning stoner. I started smoking 10 years ago when I was having trouble sleeping, and have smoked almost every day since, pausing for pregnancies and breastfeeding. 

I suppose life is tough for all of us, no matter what stage we're in. I want to quit, but cannabis is my crutch and I can't imagine getting through my days without it. It's the thing that keeps me going all day. I've tried to quit many times. Even during my pregnancies my cravings never ceased. Every night I'd lamet to my husband about wanting a bowl before bed. I have worked with a therapist, but don't have time or money for that right now. I try to do the recommended things - delay, distract, etc. But the problem for me is, I'm stuck with screaming children and an moody husband. I can't just go for a walk, or meditate. I can't go to a meeting - these turds want dinner (just to throw it on the floor) and attention. I want to scream and throw things I'm so overwhelmed, exhausted, and frustrated (and I'm struggling to just accept these feelings bc that's not who I want to be). And its just so easy to escape to the garage for a moment, to come back ready for legos or a dance party. The mental shift I get from the hit is just enough to calm me to be present with my kids, or make me forget work stress for a few moments so I don't rush bedtime. It also increases my libido, which keeps my husband (and me) happy. 

But I'm tired all the time. I'm apathetic about cleaning my home and taking my kids to do fun things on the weekends. I'm ragey all the time. I'm afraid my kids will associate the smell of weed with comfort. My memory is shot and my ambition at work has slowed, as well as my ability to recall things I should know. I feel like a fraud at work. If they knew what I did on the weekends, I'd be out on my ass. Inauthenticity sucks. 

Sometimes I trick myself into believing that my smoking makes me a better, more patient mom. But I can barely remember the last 4 years and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna want those memories someday. I'm afraid I'm going to die of throat or lung cancer at 55. Most importantly, I'm a slave to my habit. I'm always remembering to take it with me, or place and order and run to the ATM before the delivery services close, or jonesing to leave a party to get home and smoke. I'm taking an international trip and already scheming how I'm gonna get edibles there and bummed I won't have my flowers for a week. I mean what kind of an idiot do you have to be to think like this?!? 

Someone once told me to do it for my kids. That should be enough! But it's not. Not for me. What kind of mother does that make me? People move mountains for their kids and suffer in unimaginable ways. Am I truly that selfish? I feel like a hamster on a wheel and I want off. I want a fucking refund for this American Dream bullshit. How am I going to stop this pity party of excuses and get my shit together? Where are all the moms who have figured this out? Where do I even start?",25

Daily user, hit at least an eighter per week if not more. Then came the dabs, those glorious dabs, that fueled my college years. I switched back to weed after college but my high just wasn’t the same because my tolerance is maxed out at this point. 

I just turned 25 in January, I’m trying to make my way into commercial real estate and my mind is just clouded. My short term memory capacity is absolutely shot and I feel my life is spiraling downwards. I’m not even enjoying the high anymore, it just feels like habitual routine that I can’t quit. 

In the words of Jroc, today is the mahfuckin day. I’m done. I can’t afford it. I hate myself when I’m high alone and I have a wonderful longtime gf that I need to provide for. I won’t be able to figure out this real estate industry if I’m baked 24/7 and I’m tired of living my life in a haze and masked by eye drops.

So my question for you guys, what are your favourite reminders when you're on that train of thought that get you to dismiss the thoughts and push through? At the moment I think of my partner and money, but I'm much more bearable around my partner when high, so it's easy for me to make excuses about how its for his sake when we all know that's a load of baloney. 
I want to pass through today without it. And tomorrow, and hopefully every day after that. I'm here to flick that green stuff away from me just like a boogie. We all are and we can all do it! Not everyone gets the opportunity for a support group like this and for that I am grateful.",3
2020-02-04 14:41:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eyvp90/rebound_anxiety/,Rebound anxiety!,"Day 30 here.

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for the majority of my life. Since quitting, I’ve experienced the following: nightmares (when I’m able to sleep), waking up around 4 am, crippling anxiety, intrusive thoughts, compulsive behavior, and persistent yet nebulous shame, guilt, and feelings of doom. My neck and jaw are incredibly tense, my sinuses throb with pain, and I just absolutely feel awful about myself.

I’m seeing a therapist once a week. I find I don’t have the energy to exercise or pay much attention to what I’m eating because I have such a sleep deficit and it’s all just adding up.

So my question to you all- If you’ve dealt with this stuff before, what helps? Does the anxiety eventually even out? Did you find you have more energy after, say, a couple months? What’s a good first step?! 

I won’t smoke because I don’t want to start this process all over and have something else to feel awful about. Guess I just thought I’d be feeling objectively better by now. Each day crawls by. I have a lot to be excited about and to live for but I just can’t seem to hold it together. I know life isn’t supposed to be all sunshine and rainbows but it sure feels bleak.

I always used to think it helped me with everything, viewed it as a panacea for all of my anxiety problems, etc. I always thought that I just had some kind of incurable social anxiety disorder that prevented me from talking to people effectively, that caused all kinds of strange (yet incredibly transparent) body language. I didn't start to realize that maybe weed was the reason for this, that it was retarding my social development, until I had to lay off it for this new promotion, which requires me to utilize all of the skills I have learned specific to my job, but also to manage and train others in the same skills. After seeing my immediate social progress at work, and noticing that I actually have a memory again, I decided...fuck weed. It may be good for some people, but for the longest time now that I consciously think about it, I was only using weed as a part of my identity or as an excuse to hang out with my friends (who are all stoners). All of my friends are shocked at my decision to quit. It's hard being constantly offered it every waking hour (yes even at work, especially at work) and having to say NO, but now, saying NO gets easier every time. I never learned the power of NO. That's probably why I got here in the first place. I had a dream last night that I smoked weed again, and it was literally a fucking nightmare. I haven't had such vivid dreams since I was a kid. I have been relying on my girlfriend to function as my own memory, and now I'm remembering shit SHE forgot. It's fucking crazy.

Everyday I make the conscious choice to not smoke today and now I look back to be honest I never expected to make it this far but here we are. It started as a t break for me but the benefits of stopping were so good it seemed better than the high. Up to the point of when I stopped i was going through the motions of college and I can’t tell you a single thing i was supposed to learn. I was seeing a girl who while fun was not good for me because she never challenged me to be better. I realized I had lost so much physical strength and muscle by the time I stopped smoking. And the munchies tipped the scales for me. 

My New Years resolution for 2019 was to make it the year of me. I wanted to improve my well being because I was not satisfied where I was in life. The steps i took were small I changed my diet increased working out and I cut out smoking. Slowly I dropped about 30 pounds which improved my weight and mood. My increased energy made me get after it in the classroom. This past year I made the deans list for the first time ever in college. I’ve been able to also hold a steady job. As much as used to hate being busy and occasionally stressed I also kind of love the pressure. It makes me know I’m alive. The biggest change by not smoking pot has been in my wallet. Holy cow I never realized how much money I spent until I stopped. To put it in perspective between the weed, food, and dumb high purchases I’d make, ive been able to purchase myself a car. 

As great as my life as been I wouldn’t say it’s been without struggles. At first without visible progress there was a lingering thought I was wasting my time even trying. I can tell you it’s all worth it. Rome wasn’t built in a day nor is rebuilding your life. Focus on the things you can control and make those things better a good first step can even be just cleaning your room. By taking small steps every day I’ve amassed enough to look back and see wow there actually has been a lot of change in my life while it didn’t seem like that much at any one point. Weed muted my emotions for the longest time and feeling the range of anxiety and sadness actually scared me but I’ve come to learn it’s okay feel something even if it’s not always positive. While yes these emotions can suck I needed to process what was going on in my life to move on. But also when I’m happy and content there has been no better feeling. Usually I get it when I’m driving around too fast on twisty roads but also I get it from completely goals off my list like recently I had gotten to the 1000lbs in lifting. Generally I put a lot of effort into my social interactions because I learned from smoking what I really craved is learning about people and being in their lives.  I love hanging out and I love being there for them during the good times.

2020-02-04 10:34:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eyrr8p/long_term_stoner_1_week_in/,"Long term stoner, 1 week in","Hey everyone,

As most of us have probably been in this situation, I figured I'd share my story in hopes of getting some moral support. I had a transaction fall through, leaving me dry for the past week. As all of us know, this happens from time to time but what I didn't expect was how it would affect me in the days to come.

I've been smoking occasionally since high school, but once I hit senior year of college, I discovered that weed made me calm down and focus more, even when I'm not high. Cue me smoking several times a day for 5 years; on average, I probably go through 0.5oz a month. My tolerance has increased dramatically in 5 years, to the point where my body/throat/head will be in pain by the time I feel that I've gotten enough. I've gone entire months with a sore throat due to the shear amount I smoke, but that never deterred me. Needless to say, from the outside looking in, things are problematic.

The first couple days without were easy... Excitement over finding another source kept me going. The days were long and I was bored, but at that point I was still planning on getting more and going back to my usual ways. I had a few emergency stashes around with tiny amounts, so in a sense I kind of weaned off for 3 days without feeling like I ever actually got high.

Day 4 was when I really started to panic. My stashes had completely dried up, anxiety had set in, and oh my God the boredom. When you are used to being high all day every day, everything is so much less fun without weed. Boredom, along with the hope that i might be able to find a source, made me anxious and miserable. It was all I could think about, every day just hoping that I would score today. If not, it'll work out tomorrow for sure and then I'll be high again.

Well now, on day 7 (or day 3 if we're counting cold turkey), I've officially realized how awful this is. Yes, it makes me relax and focus, but at what cost? I live a very fortunate life and all of it could go out the window with a single possession charge, much less an ""intent to distribute"" charge from the amount I'm used to buying. Aside from the social consequences, I worry over the lasting damage that a substance like this could have on my health.

So this is me quitting, hopefully for good. I will miss weed and I can't guarantee that I'll never smoke again, but I can't keep living the life of a chronic stoner anymore. Currently I'm dealing with headaches, trouble sleeping, night sweats, extreme boredom, loss of appetite, anxiety, depression, and just all around withdrawal. But fuck it. I don't like who I am when I can't find a source and I'm not going to let a substance ruin my life, whether via jail or health consequences. Next week, my health insurance will change for the better and I can finally afford to see a real therapist and get real medication, instead of the self-medication I'm used to. This is my out- without the potential for real psychiatric help, I don't think I'd have the motivation to quit. Thankfully, that is something to look forward to and I hope that I can finally get real help and put this chapter of my life behind me.

I was expecting to have horrible dreams, find it hard to keep myself calm, not be able to see my friends for a while and would have to avoid being around weed at all but it’s the complete opposite i’ve had so far. 

When i was smoking I’d never feel this clear minded which has done a lot for me already to be able to realise that weed wasn’t doing me any favours. I thought weed was helping me relax and concentrate or chilling me out but i can see now that it was making me more irritated with my life and i’d just smoke myself into a state where i’d forget about my problems until i wake up sober and repeat the cycle. 

Since realising that on day 2 that i had broke the cycle already and was feeling a lot better about myself i know i don’t need weed to relax now because i’ve never felt more relaxed in my head than i have been these 5 days and can sleep just aswell without a joint. 

I felt so good that on day 3 i got my friends up so they could have a smoke in front of me to test myself and i was watching them smoke and asking them why they feel they need it and they all said to help them relax and chill but in reality they were actually having to get up and down to go and smoke joints outside and in the end i was the one chilling all night instead of up and down to get a joint so i’ve started to feel tired earlier. 

I’ve had no dreams yet and i’m not saying I won’t have any withdrawal symptoms but right now i feel i have none. I used to lash out sometimes at my friends and family when I was feeling stressed about life etc and now i actually feel less irritable because i’m getting my life on track and don’t feel as angry with myself so haven’t been lashing out. 

To end my post I just want to write this to hopefully help someone who is in the same situation i was in and who’s scared to stop because they feel they will be a lot angrier and have bad dreams that you may not necessarily feel this as much as you feel happy with yourself that you are doing the right thing for you! I’ll keep updating this if i feel any symptoms but right now i’m on a natural high about my life and where it’s heading as I’m starting training for the oil rigs so can only go up from here!",3

Some questions I got on my previous posts. 

What’s the most beneficial thing I’ve noticed from being sober this long? — definitely a clear head, lack of extreme drug induced anxiety, relationships in my life are stronger, fatter stash in the bank account that keeps growing, I dream often and could remember them. 

Did my memory come back? —  memory did not come back 100%. I still find myself struggling on a few things to remember and have to accept the fact that I blazed for years while my brain was developing. It sucks but I still made it through college and have a big boy job so anyone can do it too. 

How long did I smoke? — I smoked for about 13 years. From 14-27. From 25-27 I was tapering off going through quitting stages. 

How long did it take me to quit? — 25 I knew I had to quit but it was hard. I would go a day, a weekend, a week and then relapse. I’d say a solid year and a half of this cycle with the longest streak being about a month before I finally started this year plus sober stint. 

Do I still crave? — I do, it’s not nearly as intense or as often but it still comes up from time to time. It usually subsided as quickly as it came up. 

Do I drink? — I noticed that in the early stages (day 30-90) I found myself getting drunk a bit more often and smoking some cigars. That’s tapered off and I’m just living normally. 

Any other questions feel free to ask.

And sometimes, the memories come back and I get really pissed about it all over again.

Something I liked about weed is that, whatever feelings I had at the time, I’d smoke weed and be chill again and not worry about anything. But then I guess I get too accustomed to that, and when the weed is gone, I’m just kind of always pissed.

Smoking doesn’t make your problems and issues go away. It just temporarily take off from your mind and when u become sober after years, it’s still there.

No longer self medicating my mental health issue, and tackling it head on.","I feel surprisingly great. Surprisingly, also, no cravings. I don't doubt there won't be some in the future, but I'm taking it moment by moment, day by day.

I started an antidepressant a few weeks ago. I think it's starting to have an effect, because my mood has definitely improved. 

I've relapsed many times these past months. I think trying to look at things optimistically and constructively is preferable to chalking them up as failures. 

What I've learned is that I need to keep myself occupied. Sitting around all day waiting to feel better is a good way to eventually feeling worse. Creating reasonable, attainable goals is very important to my recovery process and life.

My current goals are as follows:

Create and maintain a basic routine - I'm talking the simple, everyday stuff I neglect when I am constantly stoned. Showering, shaving, cleaning the house, going to bed around the same time and getting up at a reasonable time. Without a solid routine, a foundation, it's likely I will relapse.

Lose 25 pounds of fat, and try to put on a bit of muscle. Regularly exercise. Even if it's a 20 minute walk a day.

Study for, and eventually get my GED finally (I dropped out of high school at 17...and I am now 29)

Take the money I would have spent on pot or cigarettes and either saving it, or treating myself to good food, a movie, video game, travel, nice clothing, etc. 

If I put my mind to it, I can accomplish these things. I cannot if I smoke pot. Pot overwhelms me in many ways. I cannot function when I smoke. In a way, I'm glad I'm not a high functioning addict. Maybe that would make me be in a deeper kind of denial.

Aside from some occasional social smoking in high school, I never used cannabis until I was 32. I started smoking as a way to relieve insomnia and relax after a long day at work shortly after I moved to a state where it’s legal. I was working absurd hours; sometimes 14 hours a day for 6 days straight, largely on my feet. It was great to be able to actually decompress and sleep well, so it quickly became my after-work routine. 

I was in pain a lot of the time before I started smoking, but I didn’t think it was really cause for concern under the circumstances. Unfortunately, I turned out to be wrong. I was diagnosed with a whole slew of endocrine disorders, some easily treatable, others not so much. None of these conditions will kill me, but they make life uncomfortable frequently and excruciating sometimes. But as long as I could smoke to treat the pain, there was no problem. At least not at first. 

After a couple years of this, I don’t want to do it anymore. I don’t like the mental fog, lack of energy, shitty attention span, tendency to binge eat when baked. I’d also really like to get a better job, which I am qualified for, but I’d have to pass a drug test in order to get it. But for all the ways it seems like weed is holding me back, I have no idea how I’d manage my pain without it. Not to mention withdrawal, which seems horrible for most otherwise healthy people. I can’t even imagine what it would do to me. 

I’m scared. I feel like I’m trapped. If I keep smoking, I feel like I’m doomed to stay stuck in my current job and lifestyle, which aren’t horrible by any stretch, but I aspire to more. But if I stop smoking, how the hell am I going to get through daily life in the meantime? I know from experience that OTC pain relief won’t cut the mustard. Physical therapy might help but medical care in my area is not great and good providers often have long wait lists. My biggest fear is that I’ll fall down the opioid rabbit hole. Anything would be better than that, but the life I have is not the life I want for myself in the long run. I don’t know what to do.",3

2020-02-03 17:13:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eyf2gj/posting_is_therapy/,Posting is Therapy,"I'm feeling a little blank. Today was the last day of my Marijuana Group CBT course, the 12th in total. I attended and spoke honestly about all the progress I have made. Until today I hadn't smoked in a week and a half. This is pretty major for me. I've had a few week-long periods of abstinence in the last few months, and so I feel like I am 'jumping higher and higher' each time, so to speak, before I finally take flight into finally quitting. The mentality however always has to be focused on abstinence. These short periods are only possible because I think each time that I'm going to quit.

But I smoked after my class and I feel numb to the irony. I'd say emotional erosion is the thing that frightens me most about my addiction. I am a white man in a rich city with a privileged life; I have no immediate reason to feel as blue as I do. I experience quite strongly something called 'anhedonia', which is difficulty experiencing joy or excitement. It is a symptom of what I now know is my depression, but what scares me is that weed has done this to me. I have a wife and job that I love, but I have stopped rising to the occasion. I have truly lost my 'mojo'. I keep hoping for some epiphanic moment where I suddenly feel excited about the future. I remember feeling that sensation. I have been told that an emotional addiction to weed emerges from the brain-chemical short-circuitry that weed provides. I expect I won't feel excited about life until I have reached a certain period of abstinence.

Aye there's the rub. I know I can't psyche myself up into finally quitting. The emotional frame-work just isn't there. If I'm at all motivated by a desire for happiness, I have to envision the possible 6-week battle to getting there. I need to come at quitting like a general approaches a battlefield: with a grand strategy underpinned by a broad range of tactical tools. This strategic mind must also possess a counter-maneuver to stumbles. I write this having 'stumbled', using a cheeky joint to escape career anxiety. But I could either see this as the beginning of a big backslide, or I could see this as a brief set-back. 

I hope my rant is familiar to some of you, and consolation perhaps. Fighting addiction is a struggle with oneself, and I think among those who understand, we ought to recognize the heroic nature of what we are trying to do. You are a general who is sizing up the enemy 1st thing when you wake up and last thing before you go to bed. There can be surprise attacks throughout the day that need to be prepared for.

The difficulty is that I have been a stoner for a few years now and this all sounds like hard work. But if I keep smoking like this I will possibly lose my job, and I might push away my wife. This is my battle-campaign. I have mainly written this as my own personal debrief.",4

I've never really used reddit but came across this support group through some Google searching. Seems like a friendly open place and a good place to start.

So I have smoked pretty much every day for the past 5 years. It has always been at night, my little escape, my chance to wind down and relax, a little sedation and a way of making things for me, more interesting... TV shows movies etc.

In all honesty I love smoking and I've never let it get in the way of the important things. I've never chosen to smoke instead of doing something social or I've never skipped family events, it has never gotten in the way of my relationships or my job. I gotta say I have a very good relationship with weed but without it there's a part of my life that is missing. 

I'm quitting because I'm soon to be a parent and I know I have to be responsible now. When I'm high (although only at night) I'm good for nothing and I don't want to be like that round my child. Parenting is a 24 hour job. 

Anyway sorry to waffle on.... 
I haven't smoked in a week. I feel the same through the day. Noticing no real benefits. 

At night I become agitated, I feel like I'm missing out or wasting my time. All I want is to smoke and chill. 

Sure I've got the motivation not to but I could use some advice/tips of how to keep myself busy. How to not feel like this. How to feel like what I'm doing is beneficial because it's difficult. 

I just feel bored and less interested in everything.

2020-02-03 13:39:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eybl1r/day_51/,Day 51,"Easy r/leaves,

what's good everybody? I lately discovered I'm on the best of ways personally and so I thought since the community has always helped me, I'll give you some aspects that have helped and are helping me.

Few words about myself: I'm 25, m, and have been smoking weed for 8 years. The last two years of my 8 year long addiction I've been trying to quit. I'm a musician, and personally speaking, weed has always (and by always I mean every single Joint I smoked) given me special pleasure when listening to music. This made it especially hard for me to steer clear of the stupid habit, as it was so closely connected to my greatest passion in life which is making music.

For me it was important to observe that progress is - when it comes to overcoming an addiction - in most of the cases not linear. So dont be discouraged if for the uptenth time you made the choice to start at day 1 the next day. If you do wanna quit and you do try to withstand the urges of blazing more and more, there is a lot of progress you are making subconsciously even though it might not amount to a great sum of days for you to measure. I've been struggling hard for two years and I'm happy to say that for the last 50 days there was 0% effort I had to make. A fucking piece of cake if you get me. And that is because I am ready now. I choose sobriety every day with the best of my heartfelt intentions. For me it's quite simple now: I observe that my desire to enjoy the MANY benefits of quitting is WAY bigger than my desire to light a zoot and listen to sick beats. I can still enjoy music, and the sensation of listening does not have to be ""metaphysical"" in the slightest. I've come to value down-to-earthness now.

I hear a lot of people saying online like: ""I smoke weed to function"" or ""weed just puts me in the right mood to be creative""

Don't wanna be rude but that is pretty much the grandest shit idea you could delude yourself with.Nobody, and I mean NOBODY needs street drugs to function (or an external source of reward except food, water and sex perhaps). As a creative person, you are not creative because of weed, but DESPITE weed. As a musician especially, there is a certain need for objectivity when it comes to the technical aspect of making a good mixdown. I've just noticed my mixdowns have gotten so much better lately, and my creativity in general is just skyrocketing ever since I quit.

I'd like to recommend a very good book entitled 'The Power Of Your Subconcious Mind' by Dr. Joseph Murphy. I finished it for the second time lately, and I'm not trying to bullshit, but wonders are happening in my life right now, and I am thankful everyday. Basically, the book says that you already have everything you need to achieve your most heartfelt desires (or overcome any destructive habit). It's all in the subconcious... an infinite source of power that basically everyone can gain strength from (I like this idea so much). You just need a degree of harmony and the right access to your subconcious (the author says the concious part of your mind is in constant interaction with the subconcious part). It is just important to think positively and constructively at all times and to have faith in your abilities and desires. Oh, and thankfulness is a catalyst to any positive undertaking.

I have to take into account that for the last two years I have been fairly unsuccessful in overcoming the addiction right away, and 50 days might sound like a lot to someone like myself who's done it on the daily, but as you know it's best to always take one day at a time and to always keep on your toes. It might not be as bad as for example a heroin addiction, but Mary Jane addiction is a fucking sneaky bitch and it will likely attack you whenever you have a moment of letting your guard down.

If you do want to quit, but feel even the slightest sensation of pain in that moment, you are probably not ready yet. Just do your best and have faith in the goodness of your heart and in the desire to quit and sooner or later it will happen! 'Course mate!!!! There's no way your not gonna make it. Just have some trust and faith in yourself and results will follow. It's really that simple.

Oh, and one more thing: A lot of people are afraid of possible withdrawal symptoms, but I gotta say I've personally not had one moment of feeling down ever since I quit. For the first 20 days I felt good, and ever since I feel fucking awesome, better than ever in my life. Just be ready to endure possible withdrawal symptoms - should they arise - but withdrawal symptoms themselves are a powerful idea and concept which can scare one easily. Just dont give too much power in your thoughts to this possibility, for it may much more likely come to be if you are constantly afraid and reminding yourself of them. Just stay positive, have faith in yourself and prepare for awesomeness. Your gonna kick arse without the green, just trust.

Thanks for reading my bits, and thanks r/leaves for always helping me.

Respect to everyone out here, and please for the sake of your own, go kick some ass.

I sure do, that feeling is something I have chased for about 5 years but in the end it all seems like a lost cause, a waste of time.

Years 1 and 2 were fun, and why would one stop when it is fun, its only human nature. After that the stress, anxiety and paranoia began to creep up on me, an unsuspecting individual unaware of the potential risks and now I am no longer the person I envisioned myself to be 5 years ago. 

I struggle with many addictions but marijuana has always been my gripe, I made poor life choices such as driving under influence, basing friendships off of consumption, and even going as far to be medically prescribed marijuana.

I live in a country where it is easily and readily available for anyone of legal age, I don't think that has helped my attempts to quit. I have told myself that I need to stay off of it but one little hit won't hurt, well every time it does (as expected) but the mind thinks otherwise. The longer I was sober, the more I craved and defaulted to other addictions, pilling on the anxiety that I once never had before that fateful evening I had my first joint.

Well guess what, this story doesn't end here, it is only the beginning. I have been 2 days sober from everything that causes me grief and pain, marijuana is on that short list but it is a start. What is different about it is I have myself and others holding me accountable, to power through and reach my goals.

I have the willpower, and anyone else struggling also does even if it doesn't show. I am here to grow and stay true to my promises, we all have a purpose.",30

So one thing I noticed that has changed for the positive is me taking the initiative to help other people without them asking.  This wasn't something I was expecting when I quit but I've noticed it quite a bit in the past couple weeks.  It's usually small things like realizing that a guy from the deli couldn't find a spoon to eat his soup.  He asked if I had any and I didn't.  But I didn't stop there I went searching the whole store to make sure I got him a spoon to eat his lunch!   Or the other day my niece and nephew were suppose to visit from the next town over (2 hours away). But my dad got really sick and couldn't drive.  So without even being asked I offered to stop what i was doing and go pick them up.  

It's just alot of little things like that but I know if I was still smoking I wouldn't have even offered to help.  Or if someone asked for my help I would give the minimum effort and then go back to focusing on myself.  

This was just really unexpected but just another reason not to go back.  Overall most of the negative effects of quiting are gone and now I'm starting the reap the benefits of quiting. :)",24

I’ve tried quitting before and I’d get really depressed at first and have what I knew were panic attacks at night before going to bed - which had happened 4 times in my whole life including last Friday.
What I felt yesterday was different than the panic attacks I knew, my heart rate was at 160 bpm and I felt very dizzy (please no comment on that unless it’s something good as my heart rate has been a trigger for panic attacks since then). I called an ambulance because I was really scared, and because my heart rate didn’t go down when the paramedics were here they took me to a hospital. We had some heart tests done and everything seems to be ok, I still have to follow up on a few tests. 
Last night after coming back from the hospital I was still feeling very anxious. I’d start falling asleep and wake up feeling like I couldn’t breathe, but I think it’s because I’m scared of feeling as anxious as I felt when I called an ambulance. This morning I felt my heart pounding again and went to a walk in clinic, I knew I needed some sort of medication to help with that. I was prescribed Ativan 1mg, and the doctor told me to take only 0.5mg to start. I’m only supposed to take it when I feel extremely anxious.
I’m looking for similar experiences and want help reminding myself that this is temporary, because I never felt so bad. I hate saying this but this anxiety is so bad that I MISS feeling depressed. 
Did you feel something similar after quitting? How long did it last?

I smoked for the first time in 8th grade. I was new to the school, having moved at the end of the previous year, and looking to make friends by any means necessary. Say what you will about the stoner crowd, but I’ve always found them to be a generally accepting group of people, more than willing to bring outsiders in. I got caught by my parents of course, after the third or fourth sesh with my new stoner friends. Mom n pop made it abundantly clear I would not be smoking any more while living under their roof.

Fast forward to freshman year of college. I started smoking on the weekends with my roommate and some new friend I’d made. It was fun. Really fun. I bought a cart, marking the beginning my transformation from a casual social smoker to a full on stoner.

I’ve smoked weed nearly every day for a little over a year. I don’t fall asleep or wake up as easily as I used to. I’ve felt my social and academic skills begin to wane. I have less control over my emotions.

Some of these changes could be attributed to other things, such as the stress that comes with college and  an erratic sleep schedule, but I’d be foolish not to acknowledge the fact that weed has played a significant role.

I’ve made so many half assed attempts at quitting that I’ve begun to doubt my ability to keep the promises i make to myself (which in my opinion are the most important). I really truly honestly swear to god cross my heart want to do it for real this time. 

I’m looking for encouragement and tips and some one to believe I can do it, even if that someone is just a stranger on the internet. Ha.

None of the lines come naturally, they’re all forced. Everything I say makes me sad because I know I didn’t mean it. Why can’t I appreciate that my friends are supporting me. Why can’t I take a shower without getting miserable because I don’t know what to feel or think in the shower. I don’t know what voice to listen to or if there even is one. I feel absolutely nothing but sadness, confusion, and anxiety. Why am I not suicidal? I want to enjoy the day. I just don’t know what to think anymore. My brain just doesn’t care about absolutely anything genuinely. I still have social anxiety, but it’s not preventing me from being myself because I don’t know what being myself is. I don’t know what I value. I can’t care about any single conversation. It all feels meaningless. I don’t even know if I truly love my friends who constantly love me and support me. I don’t know if I feel guilty about it. I don’t know if I truly love my mom and dad who have always cared about me. What is my existence. I am just alive. Thoughts are now just pale imitations of things I think I used to care about, but I can’t remember.  It’s so demotivating to have everyone around you act like a human being. They probably have emotion and genuine interest in what others have to say and what’s going on. They know where they are in life, maybe not where they’re going, but they have something that’s grounding them. Something that no matter how hard the going gets they can hold on to and it would be worth it. I started smoking at 15 and did it daily for a year and a half because I thought it meant having fun every night. I realize It was masking my self loathing and depression, but now It’s like I took the bookmark on the book I was reading. I don’t know where I left off and I don’t know how to start getting better. Weed was my everything and there’s nothing but me. I’m fucking so socially anxious and awkward and felt like a ruined everything for everyone all the time because I didn’t know what I was supposed to say or do or think or feel and I was always in my head and weed was what let me forget about how much I hated myself and how little faith I had in my future. I’m nothing now. My life is nothing and it feels like I’ll feel this way for the rest of my life.

It was so damn hard to say no, and really I'm majorly upset and just want to get lit. Any support would be appreciated!",3

2020-02-02 13:02:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/exsah5/need_help_building_motivation/,Need help building motivation.,"Day 2 today, man this is tough. I was addicted the moment I first smoked at 14. By grade 11 it was daily and I was coming to school high every morning. I still made some really good friends through bonding over smoking and other stuff but didn't try to find a gf because of my poor confidence. Went to Uni, failed most of my classes and still didn't do anything with a girl. Even though I'm actually quite bright and cheerful around others. My confidence just kept getting worse, all while some women were making it very clear they liked me. I just had a ""someday that'll happen"" attitude towards romance. And my marks getting better. Weed kept me in my happy little bubble while things were slowly falling apart. In year 2 I left Uni with a 0.69 (nice) gpa and still a kissless virgin. And still not realizing that all these issues stemmed from my weed abuse!

The next year I started up a business making charcuterie boards and it really took off. The product was great, I was on my own schedule, and profit was good. I was feeling good mental wise. Was feeling motivated towards the business. Then my addiction got to it's worst, I was smoking a few grams a day. People took serious interest in my business, and I could see how some women really liked me after they saw the passion I put into building it. Yet I still didn't act on anything because I was always high and anxious. Slowly my drive for the business died, as I wanted to get high instead of work all the time. My space in the shop has just been collecting dust all while I have this beautiful product that I don't have the motivation to share. I still have time to save it, but somehow this doesn't move me forward towards beating my addiction. Understanding that all my issues stem from weed isn't moving me forward. My motivation for most things is now gone. I don't eat well, I don't workout anymore, I don't see many people that would love to see me. I think I'm quite depressed. But there are times when I do feel true happiness and optimism for my future. I'm usually quite happy around others. I'm spending way too much time alone. I can't tell what feelings are truly real right now. I've shown my potential, what I think is the real me, in so many ways. I'm just having trouble reaching it again. I made it 45 days sober once and the growth I was just starting to make was immense. But I always convince myself I deserve a smoke after all the hard work, which leads me right back to square one.

I guess I'm realizing that I really should never smoke weed again, which is a hard reality to grip. Thank god I was able to open up to some of my closest friends, and they've supported me. That was the best thing for me, finding people to talk about this issue with. I've been going to an addiction agency called ADAPT the past two months and it's been extremely helpful. We are far from alone in this, you just need to allow yourself to be vulnerable and find people to talk to. You need to share this stress. I love the community aspect of this sub and I'll always try to help someone else here. I find I get even more out of face-to-face conversations about my addiction. I'm going to push through these next couple weeks and do my best not to break, it's the only thing I can do now.

Thanks for reading, my question to you guys is: How do YOU specifically build motivation? Do you think an anti-depressent or something similar would really help me now? I'd rather move on without having to take something.",2

I'm usually up at 8AM for breakfast and then working through til 5:30PM. I'm then occupied with the gym from 6PM to 7:30PM by the time I'm home and showered. I'll do dinner, eat and wash up which takes me to about 9PM, but then it's around that time my anxiety sky-rockets, most probably because this is when I'd usually sign-off for the day, blaze up and game. I've taken up reading and that does kill time quite nicely, however I don't want to rely on JUST reading books. I aim to be in bed by 11PM/12AM but it's filling the void between dinner and then which I'm struggling with.

I've no interest in gaming still so any suggestions on what you guys tend to do would be really helpful. Hoping for a strong start to the week but am aware the anxiety could crop up at any minute. At the point now where I'm taking it week by week, not day by day.",13

Hit my first real hurdle yesterday with some serious cravings that pretty much lasted on and off the entire day. It started in the morning and kept randomly popping up.

It wasn't so much a craving for weed, but the craving for *something*. I wanted the familiarity, the routine, to fall back into that same old pattern and a release from the uncomfortable unknown of something different.

I knew smoking wasn't what I really desired and it was reasonably easy to not give in, but damn if the voice wasn't loud.

Woke up today not wanting to smoke and incredibly thankful that I was able to maintain the willpower yesterday.

When we first met we would spend long nights and weekends on the couch giggling at things and getting to know each other and it was lovely, but 7 months down the line we realised we were neglecting other parts of our lives, such as cooking regular, healthy meals; and were constantly in a groggy haze.

I suffer from chronic pain including chronic menstrual pain which is where this story is going. Last night I was having such severe pain that no OTC medication would touch. I had taken the last of my 60mg codeine from a surgery I had last year and knew I couldn't get any more; and even if I could it makes me itch so badly I didnt know if I wanted to.

My partner and I agreed to pick up 2g of weed to ease my pain over the next few days as it's the only thing that had worked for me historically and we talked about how we would have to be strict with ourselves so we don't just use it as an excuse and slip into old habits.

We shared 2 spliffs over the evening and woke up this morning honestly never wanting to be smokers again. Feeling groggy and lazy we remembered how much we missed the clarity and motivation we had gained over the 19 days of sobriety we had and we didnt miss our clothes and home smelling of smoke.

It's also worth mentioning that I suffer from OCD and my current compulsion is skin picking - dermatillomania - which means I will (absent mindedly or in a state of hyperfocus) scan the surface of my skin with my fingertips and then obsessively ""dig out"" any perceived imperfection with my fingernails. This can last for hours and often ends in the skin on my face, neck, scalp, arms, legs, shoulders red, swollen and bloody. It's been a huge insecurity and source of stress for me for YEARS, which hasn't been helped by therapy, and it wasnt until I found myself stoned and in front of a mirror in an all-too-familiar trance state that I realised I had barely touched my skin since I stopped smoking and my skin was healing beautifully...until I had started to undo all that because I was stoned. 

Anyway, whilst I was worried that using marijuana medically would be a slippery slope into regular smoking again, the experience really helped me highlight all the things that have gotten better in my life since quitting, especially my skin being clearer than it has been in years.

I'm hoping that typing this ramble will give me some accountability to look back on and keep me from persuading myself smoking is a good idea again in future.

Apologies for the poor structure or any typos - I'd fix them but I just don't care enough tbh :)

TLDR:  quit weed and missed it daily, smoked again for pain relief, surprisingly reaffirmed to myself that I dont wanna smoke again.",1

This is my story.

 I tried cannabis for the first time when I was 16 (22 now, soon 23). I had a very powerful almost trippy experience which scared the living shit out of me (visual and sound distortions intertwined with maniacal panic attacks) . Needless to say I didn't touch weed for almost 2 years. 

Everything changed when my first gf of almost two years cheated on me which destroyed my self-conscious in ways I can't even describe (I was 18 at the time). It also resulted in a big scandal within my class (we shared a class in highschool). Those few weeks were living hell to say the least. I was helpless and full of rage, feeling things I never felt before and didn't have the slightest clue how to deal with it.

 Then weed happened. It made me inert. Made me feel nothing, which made me feel good. I finished highschool and went to college. Smoked away my inner self. Didn't have interest in anything, including romance. I was depressed.  Failed 2 years of engineering. Tryed again in a slightly different field. Cutting back on weed helped my somewhat. Now finishing my third year. Still no real interests.

Now this is where I finally realised that the cure I was so dependent on was poison. 8 months ago from today I fell in love with a girl by pure luck. She was sent from heavens. She genuinely made me feel alive for the first time in 4 years. Something I thought would never happen. I promised myself I wouldn't fuck this up. Guess what? I fucked it all up. I let my addiction dictate my life which drove her away. Back to square one.

Again.

I'm done.

We may **think** about doing everything and more, have great ideas and make all sorts of plans that are probably in line with our higher purpose - while just *sitting* there, in reality our world may be crumbling around us but we don't care because we are high, those wonderful thoughts only to be forgotten for the next ones.

&#x200B;

We have spent money to 'buy happiness' that fades quickly, at the cost of sitting somewhere trying to hide away with it safely, and whoops! All of a sudden ten years have flown, and the misery is worse than the pleasure.  

&#x200B;

Maybe we realised that we should stop smoking only to allow ourselves to become trapped in a cycle of repetitive thoughts such as 'I *deserve* to smoke tonight, just once more, tomorrow will be easier to stop because... and so on.' 

&#x200B;

Vice feeds on virtue. We may be able to let our mind fly when we are high but the *reality* is usually the same - all you are doing is sitting there, spending money and hurting your brain and lungs. Have you ever noticed the feeling of specifically seeking **pleasure** and finding **pain** in the extreme disappointment of that thing you expected to be good? It might have been spending loads of time preparing a meal only for someone to make a scathing remark on your cooking. Weed is a bit like that - especially when you see older people who are dependant on it.

&#x200B;

The righteous life lies in being *unafraid* of and accepting your suffering/ pain and finding true joy beyond it. We are built for struggle - not leisure. When we challenge ourselves we are in our natural state and can live a life we were born to live. Let us reflect our **true** thoughts and purpose in our actions and remain on autopilot no more. Time will slow down, there will be a struggle, but I for one cannot let another ten years pass. I am jumping into the pain.",48

If you have decided to  quit weed it's important to know that what's keeping you apart from being the best you can be is not only the fact that  you smoke weed but the fact that you are the type of person who would let weed ruin your life, I dont want to be that person anymore, that person can't smoke weed the way I smoke and that person can't go on just sober and filling that void with something else (be it another drug, comfort, any kid of surrender...).

In fact, I considered that one of my hobbies at the time.  During my honeymoon year with weed (2017), some of my best memories was watching all of my old favorite horror and comedy movies high.  It gave them somewhat of a new magic that they didn't have before.  I would watch some of my favorite scenes over and over again.  I really miss those days thinking about them.

At some point however, that stopped.  And not only that, I kind of lost interest in seeing new movies.  I probably only went to one or two per year during 2018 and 2019.  I blame the fact that weed made me too ADD to sit through an entire 2 hour film.  Plus, as my usage increased, I was many times too stoned to comprehend a full movie.  There is a reason that most stoners prefer adult cartoons over anything else.

One thing I was really looking forward to with quitting is being able to get back into movies, but I find myself still too ADD to enjoy them.  I'm only on Day 18.  Can anybody else relate to this and did you experience this also when trying to quit?",1

It been a long month. When I think back to Jan 1st, it really feels like so much time has passed I can barely believe it. It's been a really rough period that has taken it's toll on me mentally. Thankfully I feel like things are finally settling down. I promised myself that I would write a post at the end of my first month, but as I've been using this sub as a diary of my journey, I've documented many of the highs and lows already. Things are ticking along fine now and the acute period seems to be over. I no longer crave or even think about weed that much anymore. So what do I write for my 1 month anniversary? If I may be so bold, maybe I can give some advice to those who are contemplating quitting or those who are at the start of their journey. The following is based on my own personal experiences and my not apply to everyone. So here it goes....

1. Firstly, and I can't stress this enough, put some distance between yourself and weed - at least for the initial couple of weeks. Delete dealers numbers, stay away from pot smoking friends, clear everything weed related from your personal space. And I do mean EVERYTHING! I have found myself  searching my draws for weed crumbs more than once.
2. Be kind to yourself. The first couple of weeks are pretty rough. If there was ever a time to treat yourself it's now. Indulge in the things that make you happy. Use the money you've saved for some new clothes, trips to cinema etc
3. Have a plan. In my experience, quitting weed left a gaping hole in my life. It needs to be filled by something. In the first couple of weeks my motivation was at an all time low. All I could manage was watching countless movies / tv shows - but in the long term you will need to find new interests to fill the time.
4. Make lists. I've written down reasons for quitting, goals, regrets and promises to myself. It has really helped to read them back from time to time in order to stay focused.
5. Bring non-smokers into / back into your life. Over the last month I've reconnected with some old friends / family members.
6. Try your best to put a brave face on it. For the first 10-15 days I was extremely moody and irritable. The last thing I needed to do was push people away. I needed all the help and support I could get.
7. Embrace exercise, cut down on sugar and caffeine. Exercise gave me a natural 'high'. I started drinking lots a energy drinks to give me a boost. I realized when I stopped drinking them that they were making me super anxious and edgy. I've always been a little sensitive to caffeine so this may not apply to everyone.
8. Taking hot showers or baths in the evening helped me relax. I'm not sure why but it really helped me unwind an hour or so before bedtime.
9. Go to bed early and wake up early. For the first couple a weeks I needed at least 30 - 45 mins extra in the morning in order to function. I would feel sad, anxious, stiff and rattled upon waking up. I would just lay there in bed, listening to music, podcasts or watching tv to loosen up and mentally prepare myself for the day ahead.
10. Use this sub. I honestly don't think I would have made it this far without it.

As always, thanks to everyone in this community for your continued support, honestly and advice. One month done...I can't believe I'm here! Stay blessed :)",86

Who you meet, the friends you keep, these are all factors that can pave the path that shapes you. So imagine how much something like weed can impact you, imagine what kind of chain reaction daily smoking hazes can effect you. 

When you’re smoking, the haze doesn’t make you see it. All you feel is less care for anything or anyone because you’re subconsciously waiting to load your bowl. This slowly turns you into into a diminishing return and your work ethic is crap... but you’re not attentive to that because you’re on autopilot. 

I thought I could escape the weed hazes, even smoking nights effect the next day because you didn’t get REM sleep. 

I thought I was going to draw the line with weed when I got screwed in the past... but failing exams, social issues and doing poorly at work wasn’t enough. I just got fired from my job, I don’t directly attribute it to weed, but I think I would’ve had the horse power to have my own back work wise if I wasn’t sleeping after smoking. 

My pattern: fail exam/fired/make a bad impression of my work ethic ——-> leave weed to get my shit together and slam dunk any bullshit out of the park and pass the exam/land the interview——>   Now that I’m settled, time to toke up, I’ll watch out for myself this time.

Currently I’m at stage 2 again where I’m getting my shit together. But I ain’t fucking around this time. For the first time, I’ve been documenting everything about myself, how I feel, what my objectives are, I also started writing a glossary of the content in my life. Once a week I’ll go over the agenda to see if I’ve met my objectives, of what I did throughout the week, how I’ve been feeling. Most of all, THC won’t be something my body stores like a vending machine.",2

This was about 6pm.  Then soon after, I read an ambiguous text about a party, which I interpreted was for tonight, from a girl I don't know that well but really fancy.  Christ I wished I hadn't smoked that joint!  I couldn't drive or talk to people and I didn't feel like going out at all.

But these were early days, I thought, I won't smoke anything else and then at about 8:30 I'll text her back, get my shit together and pick her up and go to this party by about 10. Plenty of time to rid of this stoned feeling! 

Anyway, she text me back and it turns out this party I was building myself up for is actually a couple of weeks away.

I was terrified of wasting my evening getting stoned rather than going to a sweet party, and in trying to remedy that, I've ended up getting mildly stoned and wasting my evening feeling a bit anxious and beating myself up for getting high so early in the evening.

This scenario (except when the party actually is tonight) is one of my biggest reasons for quitting - being ready for anything, to go anywhere, at any time.  I thought about that earlier as I was deciding to get stoned and I genuinely thought something along the lines of ""there's clearly nothing happening tonight though.""

Anything could happen any day.  Be on the balls o ya feet, ready pounce at any opportunity, at any time of day.  That's why I want to be sober.",13

I guess I'm just looking for someone who has been through this and has some insight on what they experienced.  My therapist is told me it will take at least 90 to 100 days to get all the THC out of my body which causes a chemical imbalance in the brain.

2020-02-01 13:38:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/exaiev/one_month_sober_heres_what_changed/,One month sober. Here's what changed,"Hello fellow leavers,

Like many of you, I decided to quit as my new years resolution. I can happily say that I have not smoked for the entirety of January, this year, and this decade.

I wasn't the hugest stoner. I never went to work high and always waited until the night to get baked. But still, it was a daily thing and I was trapped in a fog all the time, especially when I first woke up.

I took my last hit and I threw out all my tree on new years Eve. Now that it is February 1st, here's what changed:

- I am much more clear-headed. When I wake up in the morning, it is much easier to go about my day.
- I've taken steps to treat my depression. I've been on meds for a while but recently made a therapist appointment as well.
- I'm more proactive about eating better. I used to get drive thru all the time but now I have found a good meal prepping system that has already saved me a ton of money and is much healthier for me.
- I'm reading more. I used to just play video games all the time (which I still kinda do), but now at least I have more variety in the leisure activities I do after work. Reading can be a form of meditation for me, since it focuses my head on just those words instead of the million things going through my head all the time.
- I'm better at my job. No more coming into work groggy and hungover from smoking the night before, and I'm able to organize my tasks a lot better and wrap my head around everything without getting overwhelmed. I am a supervisor, and there are so many things I have to take care of at once, so this was a great improvement for me.
- I'm much more proactive about getting things done. I'm writing things down more and plan out my days off.
- I have so much more free time. Whenever I smoked, there were so many things I just didn't want to do or just couldn't do. Now that I'm sober, I'm comfortable going out and getting errands done without being anxious or paranoid about things. I used to dismiss all my tasks because I was ""too high to do it."" But now, I have so much time on my hands that I almost don't even know what to do with it. I never realized how much time weed took away from me because I'd rather get high and chill in bed with my PS4.

Today is my day off, and I plan on meal prepping, cleaning up around the house, doing laundry, and seeing some friends. All of these things would have been so much harder to do if I was still smoking. I initially told myself I would take just January off, but I think I'm going to keep the streak alive. I'm still depressed and have a lot to work on, but cutting weed out has made my development as a person actually go somewhere instead of remaining stagnant for so long.

One redditor I saw on here quoted something along the lines of ""weed is for those who have found their way, not for those who are still looking."" I'm definitely still looking, and there's nothing wrong with that. Here's to those still looking.

Sorry for the long post, I've been a lurker the entire month of January and you guys are such a supportive community that I wanted to share my story.

Have a beautiful day!",38

It makes me paranoid, sluggish and foggy.

I had relapsed, I was ashamed and I knew I couldn't stay sober on my own. I leaned on this community; encouraged others by sharing my own experience, knowledge, and sometimes unsolicited opinions (lol). Many of you have made a huge difference in my own recovery and I hope maybe I contributed something positive to yours as well. 

That being said I am signing off. I am focusing more on my own recovery and the relationships and recovery of those in my community at home (off the keyboard). I want to thank the moderators and those that trudged this path and offer some final words to maybe the guy or girl just starting out, or coming back from a relapse:

KEEP SEEKING RECOVERY! Abstinence is just the beginning. Recovery from the ""THC Hell"" takes vigilance and discipline. A new world will begin to open up as you learn to foster the relationship around you and move towards the opportunities that become available to you. The ball is in your court. You can become the absolute best version of your self, accomplish your dreams, learn to live in the moment etc. It truly is a gift to move from bondage to freedom. This will not happen overnight, much work is to be done beyond putting down the joint/ pen/ dab/ edible. I wish you the best on your journey, seek the help you need. You do not have to do this in isolation.

I didn’t think I’d ever post here. I didn’t think I had a problem for so long, told myself “I’ll quit before grad school” or “I’ll cut down on my use” etc. I began smoking socially in high school, then more so in college, then I was a daily smoker for about 5 years. Told myself that smoking was fun and relaxed me, helped me calm down before bed, and it was all those things for a long time, until it wasn’t. 

I’m a 27F in my final semester of graduate school, and my school/internship/work schedule has fluctuated over the past 1.5 years, which has made a sleep routine difficult. Weed helped me knock out when I needed to. 

I wanted to quit for real a few months ago. I could see the negatives were starting to outweigh the positives. Dark circles under my eyes, hungry but then unable to eat a full plate of food, groggy even after sleeping 8–10 hours, increased laziness. I decided to quit while my fiancé and I were visiting my parents for a week over Christmas. Something about being on vacation and free from school stress made it easier to fall asleep without weed. For the 5-week winter break I was doing great! It wasn’t until the week before school started (last week), the insomnia started to kick in. Because of my various schedules, I’m unable to wind down, eat dinner, and go to sleep at a regular time each night. Getting back into the semester has really got me anxious. Knowing I have such important stuff each day makes it harder for me to fall asleep, and when I can’t sleep for a couple hours, I stress about how tired I’ll be at school/internship/etc the next day. I thrive on routine and can’t wait until I’m done with school, find a full-time career in my field, and can adjust to a weed-free life with some more solid structure. 

I know this will get better, but as someone who never had real sleep issues until now, this is so goddamn frustrating. I try melatonin and even trazodone, but the past couples nights I stay awake through it. I should admit, I took a 3mg thc gummy the other night which only made me panic and stay awake, so I won’t be trying that again. Anyways, I’m trying to get to a point where I don’t need to take anything to help with sleep. 

Today is my birthday, and I’m laying in bed quietly crying as I write this because it’s hard to be so raw. I’ve opened up more to my fiancé about how hard this has been for me. He’s so supportive and understands that withdrawal from weed is real- he even offered to sleep on the couch tonight because I started tossing and turning. I’m considering seeking a therapist to vent about my stress and feelings related to why I used weed in the first place. It’s hard to come to terms with being psychologically dependent on weed and face what my heavy use has done to me. I’m so so frustrated, especially because in the morning I’m just supposed to get brunch with friends so why am I stressing about sleep!!? Ugh. 

I really appreciate this sub. I followed and unfollowed for months until I was ready to quit. I resonate a lot with many of these posts and hope someone out there finds my tired ramblings helpful too. Any advice or insight on the getting through the insomnia is greatly appreciated. Much love.",2

They said they need a project manager for an important role in another department, they have reviewed my work history and my disposition, and they think I am the person for the job.  I am on a training and tryout period.  No guarantees.

I quit smoking weed about 6 months ago.  It has been a rocky road, and I had a couple fall-downs along the way, but mostly I have kept the faith and stayed as good as I can be.

I have worked my whole life for an opportunity like this.  I was always a hard-worker and smart, I always had a good heart, and usually lived check to check, and I still do.  I am a 38 year old man.

All I can say is that things like this only become possible when you are at least trying to get that illusive thing they call clarity.  I listen to the audio book ""As a Man Thinketh"" every day, and I try to ""be the gardener of my mind"" and think good thoughts.  I put effort into things like meditating, exercising, calling my friends and family more often.

I realize I need therapy however I cannot afford it, so I listen to certain audio books on the topic, and try the visualization exercises of self-love, forgiveness, and gratitude.  Nowadays I can be harsh at times, I speak up when I need to, and it ain't always pretty.  I called a friend up to tell them how I was upset about their facebook post, and we reconciled years of unspoken issues.

If I ever want success, a wife, a house, a family, this is the only road for me.  The kind of job I am looking at, I will owe it to a whole team of people, to clients, to the people who believe in me, to do my best.  Senseless nightly self-indulgence is just not part of that equation, and it might never be again. 

When I started on this journey, I had no idea what was in store for me.  I still don't know, it is an uncertain and mysterious life.  Sometimes it feels like it takes Bruce Lee discipline just to hold a 9-6.

All I can say is that I worked a lot this week and I am lonely and tired, but I cannot believe that in such a short time I have become such a different person.

Its not easy.  Nothing worthwhile is easy.  Except for when it *is* easy.  Like tomorrow, I can sleep as late as I want and go skating by the beach.

Peace and love y'all.  Be kind to yourself... believe.",17

I've been able to accomplish so much that I don't think I'd have been able to do under the influence of marijuana.

It's been really great.

I wish you well and thanks for the support r/leaves! I will post a more detailed update later.",14

I have energy I didn't have before instead of staying home all day and be groggy. I'm able to take my kids places and spend time and do things we once did without my mind constantly going bacc to my next puff of smoke. I miss it but not more than I like the feeling I have now,5
