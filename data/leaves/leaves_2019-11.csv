I’ve smoked weed since the 11th grade (now I’m 2nd year of college) and I really want to quit. I’ve spent so much time and money on this drug that now only gives me anxiety and depression, I don’t even get high anymore. I feel uncomfortable even walking down the street, I feel like people are looking and judging me. 

The hardest part of trying to quit is that my parents and also now my little sister smoke. It’s so normalized in my house that I feel like I cant talk to anyone about my problem. I’ve brought it up to my mom and dad once or twice but they’ve never taken me really seriously and don’t expect much since I’ll most likely relapse. My question is, has anyone else experienced something like this? And how did you manage? I’m only on day 3 right now but the temptations are killing me.",15

Every single day I'm stuck in this loop and it's always the same. The moment I leave from work it's a just a matter of time until I give myself some bullshit excuse why it would be nice to smoke again.

I do it and 5 minutes in I hate myself and the things it does to me. I despise the effects, it blocks me from doing anything meaningful, I just sit there like a zombie.

It's like 6 years and I can't even go there and think about how many things I fucked up because of it. Opportunities, friendships, relationships, my health, job performances, you name it.

I'm stuck on the same place as a person even though I have a good job I love but that's about it. My teeth are fucked, I have debts because I'm scared of taking care of them, I have no schedule, huge bags under eyes, I'm pale, depressed, defeated.

I don't know what to do anymore. I daydream all the time how nice my life would be if I just gave it up but time and time again I fail myself. I feel so miserable and hopeless that it if it weren't for my mom who depends on me I'd probably give up.

2019-11-29 17:43:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e3me0g/been_lurking_here_all_year_and_i_think_im_ready/,"Been lurking here all year, and I think I’m ready now.","Weed has always been there for me. Through my crippling alcoholism and drug addiction, the horrible awful relationships, all the highs and the lows of my life, I always resorted to weed to make it all good again. I don’t want to dwell too much on the past though. I know we all have our demons and escapes. 

So I’m about to turn 40 in a few weeks, and I quit bartending after 20 years and enrolled in a coding bootcamp last month. I went from smoking all day, to just at night, then just before bed over the last four weeks. I was hoping to save the oil carts and bud I already had for after I finished the program, to celebrate you know. But knowing me, if there’s any weed in the house in any form, I will be using it. I was proud at being able to go all day without waking and baking, but I seemed to compensate by over smoking before bed. That leaves me foggy headed in the morning, and unable to focus in class. I don’t want that anymore. 

Last night, I searched through all my things and hiding spots, and found all the remaining bud and oil carts. There wasn’t much left, just enough for one bowl and maybe three puffs from the cart. I finished it all, and slept soundly last night. I’m anxiety ridden at the thought of total sobriety (off hard drugs for 3.5 years, and alcohol for 329 days), but also excited. The bootcamp has been very difficult, as I have zero coding experience, but so so so much fun! I literally haven’t studied anything in two decades, and learning something new and fun has pushed aside the depression and anxiety for the most part. 

So, here is my declaration to the world, and to you kind people of r/leaves, that I too am finally ready to leave it behind. A quote from one of my heroes comes to mind, something about wanting to stay home, smoke weed, and watch old movies all day, and how his life is just finding ways to thwart that guy’s plans. That guy lives in me, too, and now I think I finally have the drive and motivation, and most importantly the desire, to not be that guy.",15

One afternoon in late September I got really high after work.  Something clicked and I revisited in a journal entry the reasons that I hate weed. I got back here on /r/leaves and started participating.  This subreddit has a real power to it.

I was watching ken burns country music series the other day and thinking about willie nelson.  It's hard to accept that some people seem to be able to live and create while high all the time. They make it look so smooth.  It can be a bit confusing. 

Then Yesterday I had a long walk with the dog and listened to the WTF podcast interview with Keith Wager who is a recovered drug/alcohol addict.  The subject of the interview was mostly addiction... how it happened and how he got out of it.  Part of what was covered detailed recovery process and how that works for this guy.  What I got out of that specifically was how important it is for recovery to help others. 

I know my own truths.  I have tried that weed road for over 25 years.  I have always been a high functioning addict, but it was definitely holding me back.  No more playing the game of life on hard mode.  It feels refreshing to be free. I feel full of time and energy that I had been missing so much.

Our version of fun always started with smoking. Like many people here I'm sure feel at first it was fun and then it was just normal. It caused me to skip classes skip work and just subvert all my responsibilities. Recently I've just been feeling paranoid when I'm high it's not even remotely enjoyable but I always seem to forget that until I'm in the nightmare. After 8 days I cant say I'm better my anxiety is through the roof and I just want to sit down and get high. But I refuse. I know I wont find any relief in it right now. Think I'm gonna spend some time at my parents house to detox a bit and as much as I love all of my friends who I smoke with I cant be around them I need to distance myself from my triggers and I know they'll understand. This sub is amazing and I'm so happy with the decisions I've made it wont be easy but we all start somewhere.

2019-11-29 07:41:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e3e9ow/new_here/,New Here,"Hello everyone, my such for a way of quitting weed has brought me here and so I will give some small back story. About 3 years ago , my step sister introduced me to drugs, both soft and hard .I am 22 and she's 21 btw. When i tried some of the hard drugs I immediately realized they were definitely not something for me and as such i stopped immediately, however I took a liking to weed because it was so simple and yet had no adverse effects of any kind. For example  I hate alcohol because of hangovers the next day and yet weed didnt have any of that or so I thought. At the very beginning, I didnt even know how to roll a joint, and I did this so that I wouldnt become addicted but that plan gradually feel apart. So back to the beginning...when my sister introduced me to it, i used to smoke probably once or twice a month....then once every two weeks and then every week and then daily and then multiple times in a day. The biggest reason for my gradual addiction was probably my step sister..and though i dont like pointing fingers the rest of my family blames her anyway..The biggest change was that in late 2016 about 3 years ago...our parents moved to a different country to retire and they bought us an apartment for the two of us. And as has probably become clear already,...my sister(step, I just always call her my sister and view her as such ) is very carefree in life..all she does are parties and drugs and more parties ...My girlfriend moved in with us about a year and half ago and she was also sucked into the habit.  Long story short...the three of us are now massive addicts. I want to really quit the most because weed has destroyed my life so far...I am final year of my Bachelor in Econometrics, an already difficult program, and I dont even know if i will be allowed to graduate because I basically failed nearly all of my last two years worth of exams. I used to be a pretty smart guy but I feel like my brains aren't what they used to be..I am always tired , my sleeping schedules are irregular, and my motivation is nearly non existent..and I never feel the urge to study or do anything productive..all I notice is the months passing by without me achieving any of my goals. My failures led me to massive depression and anxiety and this was especially terrible between the months of March to  July..In August , my gf and I went on holiday for a month...and during that time we completely abstained from weed..and when we returned to The Netherlands where I live...which is super crucial because weed is legal here and I dont even need a dealer or anything , you basically just go to a Coffeeshop and buy some.  But so after our month break...we didnt even smoke or thing about weed for 2 weeks after we had returned because we had planned to quit cold turkey...during those two weeks my dearest sister was also away on holiday..and when she returned she told us that she is  so proud of us for quitting but that she will unfortunately continue smoking in the house....so quiting was actually not that bad but it became nigh impossible with someone smoking right there next to us...To conclude this very long post....we are back where we started...daily usage...my life fell apart again...I tried to get my gf and sister to quit with me ..but it turned out to be a futile attempt ...but what I hate is the fact that I am being dragged down with them...i have so much guilt about ever introducing my gf..please give me some advice...I need the strength to quit even when surrounded..cause leaving the apartment isnt an option...luckily my sister is going on a 3 month holiday to brazil..but what happens when she returns .?? what about my girlfriend??? how do i help her??? what about me? how do i get my self out of this sink hole????",3

I broke my record after 60 days and just kept going. I kept working on myself and attending 12 step meetings, I embedded myself in a community of other addicts trying to stay sober, and here I am. 

I got close to relapsing a few days ago but i worked through it. I feel so much better now knowing that no matter how hard it gets, as long as im sober, i can get through anything and stay sober. 

For those of you still struggling, it gets easier. Not every day is a cake walk once you get to a certain point where the obsession isnt as strong but it gets so much easier. I dont obsess ofer the fact that Im not smoking anymore. I have completely moved on and turned my mind to other things. I'm happier than i have ever been and continue to make strides in my work life. 

I mean, shit, i can remember things now! I almost forgot how sharp my mind used to be before i started smoking weed. Each day the fog lifts a little more and I'm reminded why I quit in the first place.

If you want to stay sober, you can do it. Just keep chugging along one day at a time and you'll find that life is so much better on the other side.",42

Just wanted to post this for any people struggling.

Today marks 7 days clean, no nicotine, no weed, no caffeine. My first milestone.

My dudes and dudettes. This was so worth the struggle. I cant begin to describe how much my addiction took from me. The person i am in love with, countless years of apathy and depression, and so much money, wow.

Tips: 
Showers. Why? I cried in them. When you're going to melt down without a smoke of some kind,
You're going to want to just let it out. Either by yourself like i did, or with someone who can be tough with you.
You'll feel numb after, not good, but beats the smoking monster attacking your insides.

Phonecalls: everytime i craved, i would ring someone or message someone, i would talk. Anything, everything. Sponsors really help
Focus on talking. Not smoking. Treat it as training your mind and your willpower

TELL YOUR DAMN FRIENDS YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
No one will care if they dont know. Open up. Dont be ashamed.
A good person will see that you need help.

If you want a damn snack, have it.
I make salad/tuna sandwiches. I can eat 4 of them if i need, and its bad, but better then snacking on junk food to combat the withdrawals.

EXERCISE, my god. This was my secret weapon. Ive spent HOURS walking anywhere the last week.
It gives you a nice steady dopamine high that xan REALLY take that edge off. I hated walking till this week. I ran yesterday. It was LIBERATING hahaha.

I didnt throw my apparatus away personally. 
It lives in my cupboard, and i look upon it with contempt. I treat it as a willpower exercise, like bodybuilding. But i understand everyone is different entirely.

If you need isolation, THATS OKAY.
Detoxs suck, and they arent pretty. This kinda goes back to the friend point.
Let people who care, KNOW whats going on.


I'm not sure if this is useful.
But i think if i made it, anyone can. I have scars on my arm from the times i didnt believe id make it,
Prior to this quit attempt.

Whoever you are,
You can do it. Its a war of attrition that your body is GUARANTEED TO LOSE, so long as you dont change your strategy.
The strategy? 100% cessation, no matter how much it hurts.

Good luck everyone. Your posts gave me hope.
I hope mine can give some of you comfort/hope in return.",6

That was this spring and I really liked it. I guess I thought of it like it was just a break and I didn’t take the sober forever thing seriously at the time. This time I’ve decided that I’m not quitting weed/booze because I’ll have more energy, will sleep better, will have more control over thoughts and emotions.. No longer is quitting a means to some other end—much like using was a means to laughing, having fun, thinking super awesome thoughts (and in reality just being anxious and paranoid)—quitting is the end in itself. Being sober is the goal and all the positives will be side effects. Hoping that this mindset will be a game changer.   
That said, I really did quit because I started to question if my intense anger toward my wife when we argued was caused by chemicals coursing through me or was caused by something else. I couldn’t decipher what part of what I was feeling was me and what part was booze and/or weed. Well, I know I’m not very far down this road yet, but I’ve lost my temper again tonight and I’m ashamed of it now.  I’m more of a raise-my-voice yeller than anything, not a physically violent person, so don’t worry about that. But there is violence in yelling and I’m bummed that I’m that guy. We have a 2 year old and he’s seen me when I’m angry and it’s such a bummer. I don’t want him to grow up to be a yeller like his old man. Just sharing.",178

Anyone else feel super tired and dissociated? Waitressing is going to be hard tomorrow. I'm a space case.,"22/f smoked all day everyday since i was 13. Until this year I had never quit for more than a day. I managed 10 days in March, 10 days in September, relapsed, and finally quit again 8 days ago. This rime i quit tobacco to which is a first ever in almost a decade. 

I have this really crappy waitressing job at this dead diner on weekends outside of my regular weekday job where I don't deal with people. I can't talk to my coworkers about my quitting weed and tobacco because they're a really traditional Indian family and really wouldn't get it.

 I went to work last Friday after quitting and was kinda an awkward weirdo at work, not knowing what to say to customers, fumbling way more than usual, being really awkward trying to look busy when I had no tables. My coworker was up in my face constantly asking what was wrong and if I was ok, it was really annoying and hard to deal with, so I called in on Saturday to rest.

I work there again tomorrow and am feeling even more spacey than last week. Not exited. Also, I'm having a really hard time engaging in my normal hobbies of music and art. I'm on my phone a ton scrolling Reddit, watching tons of Netflix. This is very abnormal for my usually fit and ambitious self.
I dunno, I guess I need some sympathy or something. I always used weed to like, get up and do stuff. I feel like I'm stuck in the lull of being between tokes and am having a really hard time doing the things I love. I'm really sleepy, dreading dealing with my boss and customers tomorrow. Feeling like I'm wasting my days. I just want my motivation back

Last time I quit weed for 10 days I kept smoking tobacco and I had no appetite. I'm eating like crazy this time, I think because I quit cigarettes.

It’s Thanksgiving and I cooked a great meal but can’t even enjoy it because my throat is sore, it’s hard to swallow (even water), even small bites of food seem to get stuck in my throat, and my tongue feels swollen and raw. 

It’s only been 6 days and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better. 

I started smoking in my 20s, 20 years ago, and just read an article saying new research shows that cancers from intense cannabis usage may not show up until 20 years after the fact, and that people who smoked decades ago may just now start seeing repercussions. 

That of course sent me into a panic spiral, and now I’m scared shitless that I have esophageal cancer or something, because my throat and mouth definitely don’t feel right right now.

Trying to calm myself down with the fact that the overall research seems to lean on the side of no/little connection between cannabis and cancer, but new studies are coming out with longer timelines, and I’m afraid we actually don’t know as much about this powerful plant as we think we do. 

Hopefully these symptoms will pass in a few weeks — I’ve quit cannabis a few times before over the years, and never experienced something that feels as scary as this, so it’s a huge motivator to quit cold turkey (ha).

It really sucks to feel this scared and alone on Thanksgiving, even when surrounded by people you love, because you can’t tell them.",1

I hate that I've wasted so much time and money chasing that numbness. I hate that it's become normal. All I do is smoke weed and watch YouTube and think about all the things I'm gonna do which I never do because I just end up smoking more weed. I hate that I've spent around $40,000 on weed over the last 16 years (that's a q every fortnight [and that's a conservative estimate])

Like something I read recently that resonated with me, ""weed makes you alright with being bored"" and it's so true.

I want to be clear minded, I don't want to worry that I might get pulled over and fail a roadside drug test and lose my license, I don't want to spend so much money only to end up with empty baggies.

I'm sick of this rut I've been stuck in for over a decade and a half, half my life.

The best way i could think of to stop smoking it was to spend all that left over cash in one go so i had no money to buy it.

&#x200B;

This week i decided to blow all the left over cash on Christmas presents and more food for the month. I did this on purpose to ensure i could not buy weed.  I've made sure my bills are all paid and i have enough food till next payday next month. This is my first night without weed and i honestly don't feel too bad. My bank balance is currently below £4 so i can't buy anymore and my dealer does not offer tik.

&#x200B;

My next step is to get rid of all smoking related items and change my phone number to avoid dealer texts in the future.

1st dream- not sure where but I almost step on a crocodile and freak out. All of a sudden, I notice another one come up quickly behind me and I try to throw sand / dirt on it but in vain, and (likely died) woke up

2nd dream- spot a really quick shark in water while standing inside a glass building, and suddenly a tsunami hits against said building

3rd dream- fucked up continuation of tsunami possibly still in that same building where animals were being tested via technology that included putting human faces on a giraffe and exposing another giraffe to that

Also witnessed psychological cruelty against monkeys. Don't remember how. Then a weird Asian guy showing me his weird animals that were tested on and following me everywhere

Somehwere in between these, there was an extremely tiny kitten in my hand, no bigger than my pinky, that I fucking dropped from a desk but it was fine cause it was a nimble little cat

Weed has deleted my body's memories.

Anxiety: my body used to get cannabis to calm it down, and now my body forgot how to handle it. It's a muscle that i have to train.

Depression: my body was happy, and now it forgot how to be happy and produce the happy chemicals.

Breathing: my body forgot how to breathe, and now it realized it was going through a trauma, with a little physical activity everyday, it will get better.

Social events: my body forgot that hanging around smoking joints isn't enough for a social life, now it has to learn again to join the community.

Fulfillment: One joint and I'm satisfied and that explains why I didn't do anything with my life, my body is now craving fulfillment.

Memory: my body's brain activities were damaged, and it has to learn all over again to analyze and concentrate.

Appetite: my bodys appetite used to be induced by cannabis and now it lost it, it needs to learn to want things again.

Surviving the trauma of weed... This means now it's in physical and mental therapy... We have to learn how to do everything all over again, I know we all wanna feel normal, but we can't, we have to learn a lot of stuff all over again.

Tired of treating my parents like shit, dropping out of school, neglecting hygiene, losing my things, spending money and not remembering any of the memories associated with how or why, not being able to find a girlfriend, not going to the gym, gaining loads of weight from reckless eating, not being able to spend time with my mother, not being able to look my parents in the eyes, time flying before my very eyes with every other second I'm numbed away.

I cannot think or express myself like I used to - I can't communicate without having weed to make me feel like I'm having a semi decent conversation, when in reality, it's just the rush of the drug making me have a false perception of my reality. I've eating out incessantly, engaging in dangerous activity such as stealing that can absolutely ruin my future, spending money that I really do not have, making poor life choices and failing my friend's final essay that I'd promised I'd write for him (for extra weed money on the side), but waited until the morning of to even start it. Without remorse. Procrastination is the worst it's ever been. Having the need to re-up constantly, mindlessly, my good friends implicitly worried about me due to the fact that I'm constantly smoking when I'm with them, and I act abhorently when I smoke with them.

Constantly overthinking everything, couple panic attacks here, chest pain there, choking sensation from all the smoke entering my lungs every day, mild drug induced psychosis getting worse and me slowly convincing myself that it could be a lasting thing, catatonic behavior when smoking the entire day, neglecting responsibilities such as cleaning my room when my mother has been coughing for the past couple of days due to her allergies to dust. Her mother passed away from lung problems. Now this is to the extreme but it all comes back around to that one euphoric herb we can't get enough of.

In this life. This one opportunity at this life. I'm watching my 20s melt away before my very eyes. Smoking keeps me idle. I can't complete anything and be satisfied with it, ruminating about potential I used to have. Knowing I'd never be able to reach that full potential again crushes me to the core. My memory is that of a goldfish and I can't debate engagingly at all anymore. I used to be the head of the debate team in high school and now, I fumble over all of my words and I sound completely unprepared and uneducated. I eviscerated my charisma simply due to inactivity (rather, impairment) of these social skills.

I snapped at my parents today they when they were simply asking if they could apply me to another university as an independent student. I haven't told my parents I stopped going to every class this semester because I had skipped too many classes. My mind at the time thought it would be a good idea to stop going to every single class and produce music full time. I promise you every single song (rather, snippet) I produced during that time was a complete waste of effort and just amounted to another uncompleted project that I will never build on. 

This one is hard for me to talk about. My mother got laid off today. She cried in front of me and I couldn't even look at her or console her. I was afraid and I escaped later to smoke the stress away. One day, she will pass away and on that day, I will look back and wish I could have spent another moment with her. She will die thinking how her son could treat her like this when she offered nothing but love and support. I'm so disappointed in myself and I have no more respect for myself anymore.

Years have passed and I'm seeing old friends grow more than I could ever imagine - buddies of mine who were once as inspired as I was back in the day. Passionate, full of life and eager to learn, explore and manifest. Now most of those friends are irritated with my behaviour every single time we hang out. What am I supposed to say? That I have a substance abuse problem and as a result I've been unable to change my habits? That my personality is slowly changing for the worse?

Emotionless. Expressionless. How is it that a plant can cause such a dependancy where it supersede's every other thought? Everything else is erased for a small moment of pleasure? Then of course, the binging begins with that first toke. 

There's always a new reason to smoke. An event. A show. A birthday. A new strain at the dispensary. A bad influence. Straight up miscellaneous daily stress.  

Don't make the same mistakes I did. Mark my words, if you stay on autopilot smoking your days away, you will completely disassociate yourself from reality like I did, and make the people that once loved you unconditionally lock you away forever.",34

I won’t be here anymore.,"I went from smoking every single day to no smoking at all. I was smoking before work, during work, after work and until I passed tf out. This went on for two years. Before that cycle, I was an everyday smoker for 4 years in college. So that’s just a bit of a background. Today is the end of 65 days. This has been a really special week for me because I started running 3 miles everyday. I can already see an improvement. This has also been a special week because I’ve come to the realization that although I’ve been quitting a bunch of shit that’s not good for me over the past few years such as caffeine, alcohol, porn, I’ve failed to quit a subtle addiction that was holding me back. This is the internet. I never realized until recently how addicted I was. I wouldn’t really spend any time on YouTube or social media accounts but I would spend time here on reddit interacting with people I don’t even know. And it’s alright at first. Especially if the interaction is for your own personal development. I realized that soon I became dependent on certain type of posts that would give me a quick bit of dopamine. The search for good content is similar to the search for a good porn video. It’s crazy. Idk if I’m just super aware of it now that I’m clean, but I feel the release of dopamine whenever I see a good or funny post. Today I was at lunch and I noticed everyone was on there phone, scrolling through Instagram feeds, but they were still trying to have a convo. As in they’re giving their brains little bits of dopamine to feel good while having that conversation. I’ve also realized that whenever I would get home from work, I’d go straight to my room and read a bunch of posts and talk to people around the world and completely ignore the people who are actually in my life and who actually matter like my family. But it all seems good right? You’re working on yourself and it’s okay to be all caught up in your phone because it’s for your own good. No. There is something seriously wrong and twisted with how consumed we are by our devices and how much we neglect real life interactions for a quick bit of dopamine from a stupid post. I’m typing this to you because I feel like even though we quit weed, we’re still releasing dopamine through other outlets even the most subtle ones. People who were born when the internet came out and were unlucky not only battled a porn addiction but an addiction to wanting quick information. We’ve all been fucked up. I’m typing this now because I want to wish you all good luck in your journey. I won’t be on here anymore for a really long time. I’m done with these distractions in life. That’s all quick dopamine fix is, just distractions. You all saved my life. I love you all.",426

It came to a head once I returned home. I'll offer a caveat in that I was also about to eat dinner, so I'm assuming my already very taxing hunger only exacerbated the situation:

When I was driving home, I remember hearing my phone fall from my passenger seat to the floor. Okay, no biggie, I'll get  it when I park at home. I get inside, and realize, I don't remember getting my phone. I got annoyed, 1. Because I went up and down the stairs for multiple things I needed to get back into the car, and 2. Because I was already hungry, and was like, god damn I really have to go back out again? 

I get into my car and I can't find my phone, and I'm getting more annoyed now because I'm like, I didn't lose this thing so what gives? I thought to myself, if I find my phone inside, I'ma be so mad dude. 

Low and behold, it was in my room. I threw my headphones that I had brought in from my car against my bedroom wall. They're broken now. After the initial realization that I had just broken my headphones, I just got more upset and kept breaking it as best I could.

From a small sample size, this story probably makes me look like an angry person, but I would say this is very out of character for me. I don't feel like I'm ever this upset, or mad. Ever. 

I'm upset and embarrassed that I was able to lose control like that. I'm mad that this was pretty preventable. I'm mad that this isn't my first time quitting smoking for a prolonged period of time, so I should know better than to just blow up like that. I'm upset that I didn't take steps of tools I know to use to try and calm myself down before anything stupid happened.

That all being said, I'm happy that I know I'm doing the right thing by not smoking, and being angry is better than being numb and feeling nothing. I've felt so emotionally unavailable lately smoking everyday, so even though its growing pains, taking a step forward is better than no step at all. 

Thanks for listening, we got this! I hope I'm not the only one who's feeling this way.",6

Its the same with quitting weed. We can do ""nothing"" and do the same old shit day after day, or we could start to change today. If you stop smoking now, and deal with the pain NOW, the future will be easier. If you put it off, you aren't getting any closer to being who you want to be.

I feel as if I eat nothing and I do get an occasional stomach ache or some discomfort, but it usually passes within 10 minutes.  

The biggest problem I’d say is the feeling of emptiness within me.  I have no intention of smoking, and especially no severe cravings, but I always feel as though something is missing.

I hope this post will be of particular interest for students struggling with weed addiction. Warning this is a lengthy and wordy post – I am former academic after all.

I am 33 y/o who smoked very heavily for 10 years in my 20s. I did very well in both my BA and MA programs at university, and thought of myself as a highly functional stoner. It wasn't until half way through my PhD that I started recognizing that I was having problems concentrating and being disciplined.

The graduate student lifestyle offers a lot of time and freedom when it comes to accomplishing academic goals. But for a stoner this self-supervision work environment was basically quicksand. The wake and bakes, nooners, and evening tokes took a huge toll on my ability to consistently research, read, and write. I started missing paper/chapter deadlines, skipped academic conferences, and avoided academic peers and advisers like the plague. I tried to moderate my smoking but I couldn't stop the general decline in my productivity and passion for my research project.

A constant obstacle to quitting was this pesky rationalization that weed could be used as a tool of creativity and motivation. And indeed the first twenty minutes or so would usually bring about great ideas and excitement relating to my research. But I would soon be so overwhelmed, foggy, and lethargic that I couldn’t articulate them on paper. I would get high again with the hope that I could recapture these ideas but to no avail. The next day, I would repeat this delusional process. To make my deadlines (but always at the very last second), I would take a few days off smoking or drastically decrease my consumption. Afterwards, I would reward myself by buying a fresh bag and just get absolutely blitzed. By the next deadline, same shit all over again.

The one deadline I eventually couldn’t make was my dissertation. Researching and writing a 300 page research project takes daily discipline, focus, enthusiasm, and healthy choices. After 10 years of chronic use and a slew of related bad habits (e.g. unhealthy eating, binge watching), I lost the ability to routinely accomplish academic tasks. Of course, weed is not the only factor for dropping out of my PhD but it was definitely a major one. By the time I recognized that I was an addict and in need of help, it was too late to save my academic career.

For the last year, I have been trying hard to tackle my weed addiction. I am longer a chronic user but I have a hard time getting through a full month without a toke. I have been visiting r/leaves and have benefited from reading not only the success stories but also the stories of struggle and frustration.  Based on what I have read, I know it’s hard but it’s not impossible to recover. I am one week sober and hoping I can make it last. Maybe, after a few years of sobriety, I will be able to go back and finish my half-baked dissertation.

Thanks for reading my lengthy post leaves! (I wish I could have written it to myself years ago)",162

For those who want too know what 56 days sober has done here's a recap. The first 20 days were tough detoxing after 24 years of heavy use. If you don't want to relapse you need a strong mindset to put up with withdraw symptoms. What symptoms you ask, lack of sleep, not being able to eat, pain intolerance, mental health issues flood back, anger, anxiety, depression, constipation,  blurry vision, vivid dreams, muscle spams, muscles aces, feeling a constant head hi, cravings, light sensitivity, PAWS, and dizziness.  

Good things have happen as the body starts to adjust without weed and caffeine as I have more energy now, able to finish projects I couldn't high, fixing failed relationships, found an awesome Church, started going to the gym, business turned around, intimacy last longer, getting a handle on mental health, memory improves, anxiety decreased, depression is manageable, living life sober, saved a bunch of money, and vision improves.   Its an awesome day when weed no longer controls your life!

At day 56 the worst issues I'm having is vivid dreams, constipation, and a minor head hi that comes and goes. You would ask why would you want to quit if symptoms are so bad?  The longer you wait to quit the worst the recovery process will be.  Weed effect every organ in the body and these withdraw and recovery symptoms are only temporary as each day passes it does get a little better. 

For those who are on their early days of quitting weed you can do it! I quit after 24 years of heavy use and so can you! Stay strong my friends you are not alone!",25

Having to pretend to be friends with creepy, low life dealers. Spending hours at a time calling everyone I know and still not being able to score. Going to sketchy ghetto areas. Getting ripped off. 

The one that really sticks out in my mind though happened a few years ago. I was hanging out with my friend, we had no weed, and we were desperate to score. We called everyone we knew but nothing. So finally my friend said, “okay I have one more guy I can call but its a last resort. He is like in his 30s and still lives with his Mom.” And I was like, “Okay, whatever. Thats sad, but what does that have to do with us scoring weed?” My friend just gave me this look and then calls the guy - and turns out he did have bud for sale.

We drive to the guys house and he comes out to my car. Having been a stoner long enough at that point I know to ask him to see the weed first before I give him the money. He shows us the bud, looks like pretty good stuff, so we give him the cash and he gives us the dub. 

I was just about to turn to my friend and ask him why this guy was a last resort. We should have just called him first. 

And then I see his mother come running out of the house and she is pissed! She starts screaming at him, and then she comes up to my car and starts screaming at us. We just look at the dude like, Nice to know ya! Bye! I then peal off and start driving down the street and she starts running down the street after my car screaming her head off! 

As funny as it was, I honestly do feel for that woman. She must have been sick and tired of her 34 year old son living at home and selling weed out of her house.

Wasn't an all day every day user, but when I did it was heavy, all plans and responsibilities ignored and eating until I would get sick. Depression and anxiety obviously worsened by my smoking so decided to quit ""fuck it, its just 30 days"" and see how I felt.

My time off coincided with a few other improvement habits, most notable stopped viewing pornography and reestablished a long lost meditation practise. The 30 days was tough but I slowly ground through it. I would mark each and every day on my calendar, writing in the top corner of each date how many days it had been since I last smoked. Once I got past 20 I felt unstoppable, and before I knew it poof! 30 days clean and sober! I felt great! Sleeping better, thinking sharper, exercising, eating well, meditating, I even felt like I had actual conversational skills. All in all my life was going very well and I felt awesome having not used cannabis for one month.

To celebrate, I did what I'm sure thousands and thousands of users have done, I got high! Telling myself every lie imaginable along the way to sooth my guilt.

""It's just one day, you deserve it!""

""You were never going to quit for good, who cares!""

""Hey at least your not drinking, remember those hangovers? It's just weed!""

Well here I sit only a few weeks after my month off, starting over once again at day 1 after a three day smoking bender that saw me not leave the house, not exercise, not socialize, flake on two shifts at work and worsen my depression to a low point I haven't been at in years. 

If your out there after some time off, some clean time, be it a week a month, six months, a year whatever it is, and if you think its no big deal to go back and get high because you think ""no big deal, I got this"" I am telling you, YOU WILL REGRET IT!

Eating simpler foods seems to be more manageable, but then I still don’t feel like I’m eating enough to sustain day-to-day activity normally.

Does anyone here experience this at all? What do you/ did you do to get over the initial hump?",6

But I knew that if I keep on smoking I will destroy my life, I will not finish my bachelor's degree, I will not be able to build a good and healthy relationship.

I've been smoking just about 2 years and for this time I tried to find a girlfriend but after a few joints I joked that I don't need that, that I am happy and fulfilled on my own. After a year, a lot has happened and I was there for my mom when she really needed me ( my grandma had passed away) , I just came with an elaborate excuse and just smoked all day. After a while I realised that my feelings were controlled by weed, my past depression and anxiety were masked and I needed to deal with it. 

I reunited with my old friends who did not smoke and supported me that I need to seek discomfort and grow due that. I gave my all stash, my grinder to them. 

My reasons for quitting were:
1. I needed to deal with past mistakes, depression and so on.
2. I became ashamed of myself while I'm high. My behavior was very cloudy and when I watched some videos from few party's and it really was awful
3. I wasted my time. My long lost friend went to a marathon and I remember my bucket list and thought:""why am I delaying things I really wanted, just getting high isn't a life"".
4. My memories were foggy. I started to forget a lot of things and it scared me
5. Found a girl and I really like her and don't want to lose her.

Hope someone will be motivated by this",2

Life isn't panning out as I hoped it would, I just broke up with my girlfriend and I'm doubting whether this was the right decision. I'm seeing a therapist that I feel doesn't really get me and therefore can't help me - or I can't accept her help, as I tend to self-manipulate because my subconsciousness somehow seems to want to keep me miserable. I'm sick of all of this. After my therapy session today I thought, fuck it, I'm gonna go buy some weed and sit down at home. Maybe my high mind will come up with some creative way to solve all of my problems - as if... I've tried so many times to change my perspective on things by smoking, but all I ever ended up doing was an insane marathon of increasingly perverted porn, meaningless youtube videos, and a lot of self-blame. Sure, I had the occasional creative idea, but nothing ever came off it.

I stopped daily smoking around 5 months ago. Since then I've been smoking occasionally when with friends, but only once per week maximum. And everytime I did, I felt miserable again - yet I always go back to it. Addiciton is a bitch. 

Today was another one of those addiction-driven days. I wanted to see what my high self would think of my recent break up. I knew I would regret smoking and I knew I would hate myself once I'd gotten high, but I still wanted to. I was ready for relapse - would have been the first time smoking alone since 5 months. 

Then I remembered that today is an old friend of mine's birthday. I didn't want to call him all stoned and stupid later. So I didn't buy anything. Now I'm sitting at home wondering how to reach that cathartic realisation that I KNOW weed could not have given me, but my addicted mind doesn't stop glorifying that shit.

Thank you to my friend's mom for giving birth to him on that very day 29 years before I'd have a weak, almost-relapse day.

And thank you to everyone who read this. How do you deal with depression and not numbing yourself out every time it gets bad? I need to get my life together and smoking weed has the exact opposite effect - yet the prospect of getting high is just so tempting...",7

I was smoking a ridiculous amount, I'm talking every day probably a hit from my vape pen once an hour for the past year and a half, maybe 2. I would wake up, take a fat rip in the morning, then proceed to take a hit every hour or every other hour until I went to sleep at like 3 AM. 

I really sat down and looked at how negatively weed addiction was affecting my life: 

* Socializing less and staying home more
* Doing worse in school and having a lack of ability to focus 
* Elevated anxiety, I was sweating sometimes out of nowhere just from say driving to school 
* As of recent, I was getting some mild chest pains that would occur shortly after taking a hit 
* Literally feeling dull and braindead, being incapable of completing simple tasks or carrying on a normal conversation
* Coughing, lots of flem and mucus, and shortened breath 

&#x200B;

Thankfully I've been clean for 3 days now and I have little intention of going back. The negative effects listed above have all pretty much subsided since I've been clean. I feel happier, more alert, and more motivated. I've started going out a lot more with friends and realized I'm far more extroverted than I thought. I'm no longer abusing my lungs with constant smoke inhalation and I'm avoiding the Vitamin E Nitrate illness going around now with illicit THC carts. 

I'm convinced that genetically I am predisposed to addiction, it's like my brain pumps a considerably higher amount of dopamine when smoking weed compared to my friends. My dad's brother was addicted to cocaine and tried (unsuccessfully) to ween himself off of it. For that reason I will probably never smoke weed again.",2

I expected the withdrawal symptoms to be much worse. I had insomnia the first two nights, but benedryl took care of that.

The only affecting me really are “ghost highs.” I’ll randomly just feel like I took hit, not enough to be stoned just feeling high (like feeling buzzed vs drunk). The problem is that when it happens I just want to actually go smoke. I know I can maintain sobriety, especially with my other scripts, I’m just wondering how much longer I can expect this to keep happening.

About 5years ago my wife got a good job. Quit my high paying job to enjoy my work as a landscaper. Life was good and kept high always. Wife doesn’t smoke but didn’t care if I did, awesome right? We both want a family, find out not gonna happen naturally. So we will adopt, find out cost between 20-60k. Looks like I’ll have to get a better job.

I don’t cheat on drug tests, if you can’t quit to get a job you have a problem. So I stop, usual week or so of being mean. The main thing is I can’t believe how long I dreamed about it. Literally like 5mo of waking every morning like dreamt about smoking did I smoke las night?

If something had a hold of me an my subconscious 5mo. I can no longer think that it ok and not evil. Lots of people on here say they are totally different after quitting. I disagree as far as my self, I’m very much the same person just not high. But 5mo of dreams that can’t be natural and leads me to believe weed is evil.

I have been smoking every day for the last two years and today is the day i am officially taking control of this area in my life. I have tried multiple times within the last year to quit, go on a break, or limit myself - none of which I have been successful in for long term. I want this time to be different and it will be different. I work 9-5 everyday, so night time and weekends are my prime for smoking. I instead plan to just be present with my SO and watch our show during the week and on weekends read books, clean, or take a walk. I am learning that I have control and a say in how this route goes. It is my choice and I choose sobriety and all the benefits that come with it for me personally. A clear mind, increased motivation and exercise, no more blunted emotions, no more headaches, no more dry skin (I know it's THC that causes my dry skin - it clears up as soon as i quit). Down below, I wrote this last night while battling with my inner thoughts. It's meant to be read specifically during urges but also just whenever I'll need a reminder - which will probably be often. Whether you can resonate with it or not, I just wanted to share it :-)

Remember:  You are your own being; a being who is completely separate from marijuana itself. You are not defined by marijuana. You are not owned by marijuana. It has no power over you. When the devil taps on your shoulder and asks you to take a toke with him, you stand your ground. You will learn over time to handle stress and negative emotions, not ways to 'cope with high temptation situations'. Again, you are your own being, which means you must physically and mentally separate yourself from the opposing force. You are strong and have so much power within your mind. You are capable of using it. So use it. 

I am simply posting this because even though I know none of you, there is comfort in being able to express what I am feeling and I guess it helps me feel a little less alone. I appreciate any advice. Here's to Day 1!",2

I hope this may help someone to put the addiction/dependence into another perspective.,"As mentioned, the excerpt below is from Aion. If you replace ""mother"" with ""weed"" it makes a lot of sense.

""Where does the guilt lie? With the mother, or with the son? Probably with both. The unsatisfied longing of the son for life and the world ought to be taken seriously. There is in him a desire to touch reality, to embrace the earth and fructify the field of the world. But he makes no more than a series of fitful starts, for his initiative as well as his staying power are crippled by the secret memory that the world and happiness may be had as a gift-from the mother. The fragment of world which he, like every man, must encounter again and again is never quite the right one, since it does not fall into his lap, does not meet him half way, but remains resistant, has to be conquered, and submits only to force. It makes demands on the masculinity of a man, on his ardour, above all on his courage and resolution when it comes to throwing his whole being into the scales. For this he would need a faithless Eros, one capable of forgetting his mother and undergoing the pain of relinquishing the first love of his life. The mother, foreseeing this danger, has carefully inculcated into him the virtues of faithfulness, devotion, loyalty, so as to protect him from the moral disruption which is the risk of every life adventure. He has learnt these lessons only too well, and remains true to his mother. """,1

I dont want to smoke which is a great thing but I'm struggling with the withdrawal my emotions are totally out of whack. My children are constantly crying about nothing... ahhh willows looking at me ahhh willows touching me is the basic tone of the day every day and while I get that's kids in a nutshell but it doesn't take away that it's so frustrating... weed always helped take the edge off but that's not an option anymore by choice.

I'm also feeling so much guilt leading upto Christmas because instead of saving and preparing I've spent all my spare cash on weed and now my kids are going to be short on gifts.. I know it's not about the gifts but to the kids it is and I just feel like such a shitty father. I wish I done this sooner but was only thinking about the smoke.... 

I just wanna scream and break stuff (not in the house) just to vent all this pent up emotion. 

What do I do?  I cant speak to my partner as she only gets mad at me for feeling like this says it's my own fault (which is true but doesn't change anything or help) I feel alone and trapped with these feelings to the point I want to explode. So happy I found this sub!

On a plus note I'm starting a plumbing training course to become a qualified tradesman so by this time next year I wont be feeling this as much.

I convinced myself to smoke because it was good, it made me feel better but here I am 6 weeks later having gone backwards on all my progress. 

The thought of stopping again fills me with dread, a massive fear of not being able to smoke after a bad day, a good day, any day.

Seems like every 30 days, another huge craving comes at me. Being depressed and without a job does not help at all. I cannot seem to do the things that I need to do around the house. No motivation to get things done. Hell, I only get up in the morning to piss or put food in my stomach. Even when I do feel motivated in the morning, it disappears within an hour. Then I just want to stare or curl up. I feel like there's something I haven't dealt with emotionally. Haven't got a clue what it is. Really the only thing keeping me from firing up is the need to work. And once I do get a job, I'm afraid I'll start up again. I know I beat myself up a lot. But instead of doing something else, it's pity party time. Feel like I don't have a purpose anymore. Hopefully when I get a job, I'll have a purpose again and not crave so much.",2
2019-11-26 13:40:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e22afi/forgive_yourself/,Forgive yourself,"Hello everyone, I'm new to this subreddit and while I've been a lifelong lurker, only seeing this sub has inspired me to create an account and join the discussion.

I'm 27 and currently on day 11 of quitting after smoking/vaping/dabbing significantly for the better half of 2019 and using weed for much longer. I've wanted to stop, and I've had successful T-breaks before..these past few months especially have been the hardest. I would tell myself every day, ""finish this bag, don't get more dabs, don't smoke tomorrow"" things like that, much to no avail. This was made even harder by living with 2 roommates who also have the same habit but lack my desire to stop. It's always around me, and made even harder still by living within 90 minutes of two legal dispensaries in neighboring Massachusetts. However, I feel good about it this time, I have a clear focus and reason for stopping. I want to go for things that weed would hold me back from. I want to really get myself conditioned and In the shape that I want. I want to be around friends and family without looking for an exit strategy so I can go back to my safe apartment and ""relax"". 

There is more to my thc experience but what I really want to say to everyone here is this: We all have different reasons for wanting to stop, from seeking a job, or just thinking that we ""should"". However, something that I have done, and a common theme I've seen from posts here is that many of us upon attempting the quit, is that we vilify weed and make ourselves feel terrible for even using it in the first place. Forgive yourself. Don't look back in shame. We liked it didn't we? We had fun with our friends, food tasted amazing and we had good times playing games, watching movies, thinking of crazy out of this world shit. It was fun, weed was fun, that's why we did it. Somewhere along the line it became a coping mechanism, and then morphed into habit we did just because we knew it. Don't hate the weed, don't hate yourself for smoking it. Don't make yourself feel bad. Look forward with focus, remind yourself why you don't want it, why it doesn't serve your purposes anymore. If you walk by a car in a parking lot and smell that familiar smell, enjoy the smell, say damn that smells like fire bud..and then immediately tell yourself ""I don't want it, I don't need it, let's go do something else"". Learn new habits, new skills. Take up swimming, meditation (two things that have helped me in the past and are still doing so). And man if all you can do in a day is lay in bed feeling lazy and gross then do it..if that keeps you from going back to it. I promise you that stage passes. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, and it's not filled with fiery embers. You can do this because you want to do this. Don't be so hard on yourself. Always consciously and constantly remind yourself of your goals. Nobody will push you or make you do it but yourself, be your own best friend. You got this. And everyone here will support you.

No TL/DR, read it all.

Signing off with love.",54

Now that I'm trying to quit, some issues are returning.

Smoking helped boost my appetite when I lost it due to depressive swings and nausea from panic attacks.  I also used to stay up nearly all night very often due to anxiety and although smoking didn't give me fulfilling sleep, it was better than having 5 hour long panic attacks.  These were all positive effects, but it wasn't worth the money I was wasting and the toll it was taking on my mental health.

Melatonin has helped me with my issues with sleep, but I've still been finding it difficult to eat on a regular basis since I've stopped smoking.  Any tips/advice?",2

Things are going very well in terms of attitude. Still feeling excited every day when I wake up and realize I am still away from the plant. 

Getting things done and finding joy in small things. In some ways it's like an alternate reality where things are just easier to deal with. I find any challenges that come up are less complicated and frustrating. 

Temptation has been pretty much non existent. I am in a legal state so sometimes it can feel a little bit like ""everyone else is doing it so why not me?"". But I know better now after my past year experience in this journey.

I've seen a few posts on here of people asking about online meetings or sponsors...just wanted to put it out there that **Marijuana Anonymous (MA)** is a thing, and you can find a local meeting to attend. Personally, getting high kept me from going to such a meeting in person, so another resource is **SMART Recovery.** They are an organization dedicated to helping people with addiction, and they use cognitive behavioral strategies and thought replacement strategies which I find to be very logical. They also have a podcast called SMART Recovery. I found that when I had cravings, or even while still smoking, listening to these podcasts still helped me feel like I was doing something, filing away information for later quitting. The best part is the SMART Recovery has daily (I believe) online meetings! You have to register on their website. There are a ton of other resources on their website as well. Here are the links below (and I realized in finding them that MA also has online meetings!)

I’ll share a little of my story as this is my first time deciding to stop smoking. I have been a social smoker since my teenagehood with no issues, but after some trauma in college, I started smoking nightly. Nightly turned into daily, which has turned into me entirely dependent of weed now 2 years post-trauma. Now, my whole life I have been underweight, as I am a naturally very petite + thin woman. This trauma caused me to lose 15 lbs total, and I have gained it all back since. I CANNOT afford to drop that weight again by quitting. It has taken me a year to even gain it back, and I was sickly/deathly at my worst weight. A week to ten days of not eating properly would probably cause an even greater weight loss for me, as i lose weight incredibly fast. 

Does anyone have any advice? Instead of cold turkey, I was thinking weaning off might reduce those withdrawal symptoms, but overall i wonder if that’s really effective in quitting? I appreciate the help. My weight is my biggest source of anxiety and i know i’ll actually probably be able to gain a lot more once i’m off weed and can eat like i used to. i miss loving food so passionately!",3

Admittedly, I did take a hit off someone’s joint at a party a couple nights ago but I was drunk and kept it to the one. However that doesn’t come close to the amount I was smoking before so I like to still consider the day I made the decision to quit my day one.

I’m not facing irritation the way I did whenever I’d try to quit before, which would always be my main withdrawal symptom but instead am facing an increasingly frustrating inability to sleep. I keep waiting for the day that exhaustion takes over and I get a good long sleep yet no matter how dead I’m feeling when my head hits the pillow I find myself unable to stay asleep any longer than three or four hours at most. I’m a lifeless person at work and as the days go on I have less and less energy to do the things I love which were my reasons to quit in the first place. Every now and then my roommates will offer me a hit but seeing how they behave when they are constantly smoking has turned me off to it. Though sometimes my brain does try to trick me and I’m tempted to take just ONE hit for the sake of sleeping. 

Has anybody else experienced a prolonged lack of sleep for this long? I’ve yet to even get to the wacky, vivid dreaming part of withdrawals because I can’t seem to stay asleep long enough. I’m going to ride this out but this is getting frustrating. Typing this out at 5AM 🤥",2

Back on day 1.,"I (m22) was a full-time stoner since the first time I smoked at 13 years old. In my last few years of smoking, I was smoking an ounce every week. Unbeknown to me at the time this was causing me far more stress and anxiety then it was ever releaving. I was heavily addicted, I wouldn't go to work without smoking, I couldn't go to my 30-minute lunch break without smoking and I couldn't go to sleep without smoking.  
This all changed when I found this sub, I sold my glass collection to friends and deleted my dealer's number. I found it surprisingly easy to quit with the only side effect was intense nightmares for about a week then it was smooth sailing for 6 months of stone-cold sobriety.  
In that 6 month period, I experienced clarity like I haven't experienced since I was a kid. In this clarity, I was able to recognize why I was so desperate to escape my reality. I wanted to escape because I was bogged down in debt, i was overworking in a job that I hated, living with a shitty housemate and i desperately missed my family who lives in New Zealand.  
While sober I was able to sell my car and use the money I was spending on weed and take away to pay off all my debt. I saved up enough to book 3 weeks in Thailand with a return ticket to my home in New Zealand. After I booked my holiday I gave my boss notice that I would be leaving my job. My life was finally on the upswing due to not being stuck in a daze.   
So now all of my problems were essentially solved. Life was going good. So good that I became comfortably bored and started having intense cravings to smoke some weed, to celebrate perhaps. So I found my dealers number again and had him drop over a quarter ounce of white widow. I smoked it over 5 days and by the 5th day, I found myself smoking bowls before work. again.  
That was 3 days ago and I only just feel like I'm back to clarity and i realize now that weed is just not for me. I must admit i did enjoy being high the first time but every time after that it just became a mental drain, I couldn't hold a proper conversation, It was giving me anxiety and i could see that I was just going to fall back into the same old cycles of addiction and depression.  
So here we are again, back at square one. Ready for the next chapter of my life and it's going to be a sober one. What I learned from this experience is that next time I get comfortable in life its time to pick up a new hobby, a book or try to make a new friend, to change my reality rather than try to escape it. Life is far more fantastic when you're in the moment rather than barely present.  
Thank you for reading this nonsense, it may not help anyone in any way but it helps me to bookmark this point in my life.  
Tl;dr: quit, got comfortable, relapsed, learned to change reality rather than escape it to an expensive daze of weed smoke.",28

I’m 2 weeks in, the dreams are fantastic, nightmares about my ex, weird shit. I have so much energy. That’s the main thing about quitting pot. You wake up clean and your brain feels happy not being raped by thc. Going back to day 2 makes me feel like saving up a ton of money and then burning it for no reason and starting from scratch. I don’t wanna go to that day again of why did I ingest thc again.

I went to a concert tonight and saw kids ripping vape pens in the pit and it made me think back to when I was them. When I needed to get stoned before every concert, movie, sexual encounter, every epic meal etc. one day they will hit rock bottom and will realize Mary is a CUNT who locks chains on you if you let her. We all have to experience her and then I guess grow up and be comfortable in our skin without the drugs

Its been awhile since i visited this sub. I just wanted to let you guys know that this sub helped me a lot during my addiction and anxieties. No only with quitting weed but also with depression. Reading other people's posts and advice really helped me a lot. 

I haven't been counting days but its  been a long time since i smoked and i don't even think about it anymore. The thought of smoking nor drinking does not linger in my mind anymore. We are all addicts and doing certain things makes the addiction or urges weaker. Here's a list from the top of my head, just a raw quick list of things i did: You can take a few and run with them, discipline is important

\- running for 30min in the evenings (3 - 4 a week).

\- new hobby, running marathons ones in a month or two.

\- quit alcohol and smoking entirely (for life).

\- reading non-fiction books.

\- drinking a lot of water.

\- look after 3 or 4 plants, water them everyday.

\- keeping calm, mindful breathing, being comfortable with boredom.

\- disabling all notifications on my phone.

\- few outdoor activities like hiking.

\- writing todo lists.

\- waking up early and doing few push ups and reading for 30min or so

\- writing in my journal at least 3 times a week.

\- only thing i watch on tv is (EPL and UCL) is sports and comedy - maybe 2 games a week.

\- quit video gaming and masturbating.

\- minimum time on social media. 

\- limited time with friends and more time with myself and family

\- if you have a junior, do homework with him/her almost everyday.

\- drive long distances while listening to music or audio drama.",31

Initially, Upon escaping this winged nightmare, I was anxious and confused. I couldn’t sleep, I was irritated and depressed with life. How did I arrive down this maze? The had walls seemed so much cozier initially, and fascinating. But the pretty walls, they are a prison. I walked right into our prison and buried the keys.

I thought I could turn around any moment and see my old memories and the activities that ballooned me with so mich childlike joy, but no.

You drove me into the maze.

I thought maybe if I just got high enough, I could over the walls. But instead you dragged me deeper. 

I played your green game. I picked you up and put you down. I trusted and followed you, carefree and trusting, but the maze tightened and choked me. But now, I have abandoned you, bastard dragon who always fools me with riddles, begging me understand life from your perspective, fooling me with illusions of independence, but, I have escaped the labyrinth. Yes I have.

After the first week, the walls lowered. Thank God! I was irritated and confused. Scared. Then, the walls widened. And sun and mountains and rivers appeared. My family greeted me. And day one turned into an uphill and then downhill battle, now I wanna love again, slowly, I form new routines, I feel the old flame rising, the heart emerges bright and the anxiety and confusion come and go, peeling away, crisping, ready to fall away completely as I stretch my legs, ready to run into the horizon. 

Thank you r/leaves for being a community I can trust through the maze and into the rivers and fields outside that hideous trap.

My ex girlfriend had told me that if you want to quit something, the first thing to do is to let the world know that you're quitting. Starting today. This way you'll feel sad that you didn't keep up your word. And the fear of letting people down is what is going to help you quit. So here I am.

I've been smoking pot for the last 5 to 6 years. I have enjoyed it but i think its time to move on now. Recently I lost a loving girlfriend because of weed. Its not worth it. I want to do it for her. Let her know that I was able to do it. There is no actual benefit to smoking weed. It uses up lots of my time. People say that they are high on life and I want to experience that. I, too, want to be high on life.

I've thought of a strategy that I picked up from reddit. I saw people posting daily sketches of Pokémon characters marking another day of their sobriety. And I like sketching. So, I've planned to sketch something and post it on this channel. I've always been low on motivation. Need your help.

Also, help me figure out what sketch I should draw today. It should be simple since I can only spend a max of 2 hrs on it. Not Pokémon. I haven't seen the series. 

With lots of love,

Helped me figure some shit out, but I made the decision to stop for a while and see where that got me. 

The last eighth I had was all anxiety; do I have one bowl left or three? Should I save this for later or smoke it now? Just one hit or five?

My wallet thanked me that's for true. 

I feel sharper than ever before, even before I started smoking. The fog is lifted, like my brain is a videogame running on optimum settings now unfettered by a million useless mods. 

The first couple days were tough so I changed my entire routine, got a new job, and stopped talking to my associates. Seems to me that people consider smoking weed a substitute for a personality, which I've run into in bar scenes and MMOs as well, that's human nature.

The annoying thing about weed culture was this atmosphere of you HAVE to share, that it's this THING that people who don't do are chumps for not doing.

All the kumbaya shit is for yuppies and consumers. 

Granted, it's a good plant; it drives creativity, helped me get some of the best sleep of my life, eases muscle aches, etc. It's like if you could smoke beer and not worry about cutting too loose. 

I figure I'll come back around to it in time, set up a personal grow so I don't have to deal with the shops and their often-times unintelligent employees, and use it on my off days. 

3 weeks out and I don't even get cravings, haven't since day 5. If you want to quit, just do it - it seems hard but like anything that becomes toxic to your mental state you just gotta get away from the culture and reroute your routine away from it. I also tossed my paraphernalia, fuck it. Not having anything to remind me of it has been the best. 

I hope this encourages anyone struggling; it's a good plant, but don't trick yourself into thinking it's necessary for your survival.",4

I need help..
Basically im a senior in high school.  I’m relatively smart and have a propitious future planned out for myself.  Unfortunately, sometime within my high school experience, I managed to get pulled into vaping (nic and cannabis) 

Fast foreword I’ve been vaping nicotine daily for two years and vaping cannabis once daily for only 1 year. 

Sometime this year though, I started smoking between 2-5 times daily. Within this period something just clicked and I am so stressed and unhappy.  I want my REM sleep back.  I want to not have to go to the bathroom every hour of school to go vape.  I’m tired of being unable to limit myself. I just want to be the innocent child I once was.

At the same time I’m absolutely terrified of quitting either nic or weed.  I feel like my unhappiness will sky rocket and I will just lose it after some time.  I’m afraid I’ll be unhappy for the rest of my days.  Most importantly, I’m afraid that the rest of my life will just be one long sobriety clock.

I tried quitting nicotine first with the idea that quitting the “harder to quit” substance first would make life easier. Wrong. Now I really want to quit vaping cannabis. I bought a juul today after freaking out to myself that If I quit nic and cannabis at the same time I’d just hit rock bottom.

I feel as though I blow both my desire to quit and my inability to quit out of proportion but I just can’t help it for some reason.

I just want to be sober and happy by Christmas time when I visit the aging grandparents that I never get to see. Please someone help or just give me input or anything. Thanks",4

I laid in bed for about 4 hours holding my head, trying to power through the worst headache/anxiety of my life, just waiting to either die or fall asleep, maybe both. Woke up the next morning, still really anxious but feeling better. It fucked with my psyche for sure, but at least it was over.

Yesterday a good friend of mine who I rarely get to see came over for a bit, but I was still so high from smoking all day that I was practically a zombie. I was foggy, quiet, mumbly and overall pretty unresponsive. And I feel like crap because of it. I missed a very good chance to really connect with an important person in my life because I let myself smoke instead of confronting the hard decision not to. 

I want to call her and apologize for it, but maybe that would be too much? I don't know. I'm going to drive her to the airport on Thursday, but that's not much time to connect. 

I don't really know what to do. I thought I had this addiction handled, but here I am months later back at square 1 and not much better off. I want to go to therapy, but I don't know where to start and probably can't afford it. I want to talk to my only other friend about it, but I'll be tempted to smoke again if I go see him.

I know it's not serving me well and it's holding me back from my full potential. I'm lazy, lathargic almost all the time, I don't exercise or have any hobbies. Weed has been my hobby, because its easy and I can't possibly do it wrong or fuck up. 

My boyfriend and I worked out that if we both stopped smoking weed and saved half the amount we spend every week, we would have £2245 each within the year. This would clear the rest of my debts. 

 I also got a pretty nasty wake up call from a co-worker who will be on my teacher training course with me next year. I divulged that I smoked weed and I received a look of disgust and he said ""and you want to be a teacher?"" (Weed is illegal where I am) Harsh as this may seem, this would be the reaction of many of my future peers and future parents of children I will one day teach. 

So if I know all this, why haven't I already quit? 
My main issue is the extreme low moods I suffer when I do stop for the first few days. They are unbearable. 

I definitely have unresolved mental health issues that I have been using weed to medicate including anxiety, depression and extremely low self esteem.

It's far too easy to just smoke a joint and make it all go away, how do I fight this initial painful part as I feel like once I get past that its home straight.
 Then as you can probably guess I have stopped before for a short period of time, how do I stay away? 


So my questions for you guys are, what to you do when you feel like the world is falling apart and the only thing in my mind that will help is smoking?
And how do you stay away from smoking altogether? 

The last few nights I have been cutting down, and trying to make as many negative associations with weed as possible, I'll be honest I haven't even enjoyed the last few I've smoked because I've actually been thinking critically about what I'm actually doing instead of just performing almost a ritual. 

Hope this all makes sense to everyone, any advice you can give me please don't hold back.",3

Hi guys. I’m very new to this community so sorry if I sound out of place.

Basically, I’ve been vaping nicotine consistently for about 2 years and vaping THC regularly for about a year now. I regularly vape THC between 1-4 times a day, always one of those times being before bed.  It was only until recently that I realized that I have not been happy at all. I know this may be dramatic considering I smoke much less than others and because I’ve been using for a relatively short amount of time.  But ever since September I’ve had reasons to quit flying around in my head 24/7, including :

I’m unhappy
-I dislike feeling disconnected from the world
-I plan on pursuing a job in medical field which obviously has ZERO tolerance for cannabis use
-id rather save my money and spend it on more practical things
-I dislike feeling like a “slave” to cannabis 
- I fear for my physical health if I continue using (especially because I only have access to black market cartridges that may or may not be an awful hazard to my health)
I get a severely guilty conscience anytime I’m face to face with any of my family members

And the crazy thing is that after all this, it seems like I can’t just put it down and quit, let alone take a short break. 


Although, I realized today that my main priority is quitting my daily weed addiction.  (Opposed to nicotine)

While I am plenty confident in myself being able to win the battle of either nicotine or weed, I don’t think my mental heath can handle quitting both at once.

Stupidly, I tried to quit nicotine first, thinking it would be better to get the harder substance over with. WRONG. I’m surrounded by triggers which I literally am unable to avoid (school being the biggest one)

I’m considering buying a vape to help me get thru this but idk

Ik this is vague, unorganized, and patchy but someone please give me any input thanks!",2

I've known for at least 2 years that weed is bad for me. This didn't stop me from continuing though. Only recently I've realized that it needs to stop as fast as possible. I made a plan, to smoke less and less, I'm on my fifth day now. I have actually even smoked less than what was planned, so things seem to be going pretty good. My problem though, is that I don't know what makes me happy in life. Almost nothing is fun to me, i barely laugh on some days. I don't know what to do, I just spent a whole weekend doing nothing and now I have to go to work just so I can go do nothing afterwards again? 

I'm not gonna start smoking more again and I'm gonna keep going after my plan and eventually stop smoking altogether. My Question for you guys is, does life get better again when I'm completetly off the weed? You know will I have fun? Because at the moment stuff that is fun for other people just isn't for me.",2

Smoked for about 5 years regularly, sometimes during the day but without exception every single night before going to sleep. Before I started smoking, my sleep was very healthy, I used to dream every night, always about pleasant things, never had nightmares, maybe 3 times during my whole life (I was 19 at this time). After smoking for a while, I stopped having dreams completely. I travel quite frequently, during my travels I’d never have any weed on me, and during longer trips my dreams would start coming back, usually very pleasant dreams as far as I can remember, the kind you hate waking up from. Well, a few months ago I stopped smoking almost completely, occasionally I would smoke here and there, maybe 10 nights in the past 3 months? My sleep drastically improved, 5-6 hours were enough instead of the usual 11-12 while I was on pot. But no dreams. On the 17th of this month I went on vacation to Sicily, staying at an old Villa. From the first night, I unfortunately got what I was looking forward to for so much time, dreams came back, but not like they used to be. First night I fell asleep, I woke up around midnight, my friends were still awake and told me I was kind of screaming in my sleep and whimpering the whole time. Didn’t remember anything, so I didn’t really care about it. Went back to sleep, woke up a little later, kind of freaked out, remembered a few things. A nightmare, whatever. During the next few days it got worse and worse. I would have the most vivid and real nightmares, waking up 4-5 times per night, hardly being able to sleep anything at all. These nightmares were different, they were all in a very familiar setting, and as I said, very, very realistic. For example, one night I’d dream about everyone getting massacred at the villa I was staying at, waking up to the sound of myself screaming, going back to sleep and the dream continued where it stopped. Then, one night the weirdest thing happened, one I cannot get over to this day. I had a dream, where a dark entity would come into my room (the one I was sleeping in) through the door, float over my bed and start pulling my leg, trying to pull me out of my bed. I woke up to myself screaming again. I had a big window and the blinds were open. Some moonlight was coming into my room. Everything in the room was dimly lit by the moonlight. When I woke up, I sat up immediately and opened my eyes. As I sat up, I saw a completely black shape standing over the bed, between the bed and the door of the room. I stared at it for 10 seconds, trying to figure out what the hell was happening. I figured I just woke up, it must be something with my eyes, so I looked around with the logic, that if it were my eyes, it would move around with my vision. I looked all around the room and saw everything dimly being lit by the moonlight, but the shadowy figure stayed in the same place, I got creeped out, turned the light on and nothing was there obviously. For the rest of my stay I slept with the light on, still having nightmares, waking up 3-4 times per night and hardly sleeping anything. I’ve since left Sicily, in Malta currently. The creepy nightmares stopped, maybe it was something with the old house vibe, but the nightmares have stuck with me ever since. Still waking up a few times every night, going to sleep has not been a fun thing since. Really thinking about smoking some weed to finally make the dreams go away, and get a good night’s sleep. I don’t know, I really don’t miss weed at all, this has been the only negative thing about giving weed up for good. Anyone had a similar experience before? Haven’t spoken about it to anyone, it must sound stupid, don’t want people to think I’m a lunatic, believe it or not, I know what I saw during that night... but the point of the post is more about the nightmares, not ghosts, so yeah, I’d love to hear your thoughts on it.",35

I am hoping to get some words of wisdom and maybe a reason to stay on track... i know it has to come from within me but I really want to give into the urge. 


I am 73 days in no smoking. I was a daily smoker for over 3 years. It started with edibles then transitioned into flower and by the last 1.5 years I was exclusively a vape and cartridge girl. The vape made it so much easier to do, so I was smoking all day every day. Even before work and family functions. 

I quit because I got scared of getting sick with all the fake cartridges out there. I realized I needed to make a change long before that, but getting sick was definitely what scared me away from it. 

Life has gotten so much better since I quit. I feel like I have my memory back. I went from a shitty part time job to having a full time job with benefits (31 days in my new job!). I’m a therapist trainee and after 1 year they help pay for my school to become a licensed counselor. I love what I’m doing now. 

I feel like my social anxiety has decreased by 60-80%. I am still somewhat shy and forever will be awkward... but i am making social connections and new friends. And my relationships with my old friends and my family are so much better. 

However, i will be home alone for 4 days this upcoming thanksgiving weekend. I am already planning to buy some weed and get high. I miss it. I want to watch Disney+ and eat all the good and have a relaxing time after all the hard work this month. It sounds like heaven to me.

I think i can do it for a weekend and quit Sunday before I go back to work on Monday. Am i kidding myself?? I really want to do it and am struggling to see the harm in it. 

Only thing scaring me is that I don’t want to lose the mental clarity I have gained. But a few days of smoking can’t take the past 73 days away... right?",8

I know how it makes sense as THC is stored in fat cells. But I had never experienced this until yesterday. 

I just posted a super long 50 day update and didn’t want to make it even more of a ramble by adding this. But I’m curious as to other people’s experiences. 

I’ve been working out a fair amount since I quit 50 days ago. But for some reason, it happened yesterday. Maybe I went harder than I have before. I don’t know. But man, it scared the shit out of me. Almost gave me a panic attack. It wasn’t the same as actually being high, but the feeling of disconnectedness was there a lot. I had forgotten what it felt like to feel high. I’ve been experiencing some pretty severe derealization, but this was that times 10, mixed in with some visual aspects. Time slowed down. Noises got louder. My mind felt insanely cloudy. 

This didn’t make me want to smoke. If anything, it reminded my why I quit. I began to hate that feeling. But it really scared me, and I’m worried I’ll feel it again tonight when I work out. It makes me wonder how long THC will really be in my system.

Also, thank you for the great community :)","I smoked almost daily from 16-19, about 2 and a half years. I always knew it was unsustainable and damaging, but I didn’t have the will power or reason to quit. At the start of this summer I started to slow down a lot, and after moving into my apartment for this next year of college something changed. I smoked a couple times, and they were all just terrible, anxiety filled highs. I knew it was time to quit for good and focus on school, as my college GPA was already pretty bad from smoking all the time. 

So I’m now 50 days out. I haven’t had a streak like this since I started smoking all those years ago. I have absolutely no urges or cravings at all. Those faded after a week or so. But man, it’s fucking rough. At the start of month 2 I developed terrible anxiety, and my depression got 10 times worse. I had an almost psychotic episode and had to go home for a week. It’s leveled since then, but is still hard. The hardest thing to deal with for me is the derealization. I’m not hallucinating, but I just feel like I’m dreaming a lot. Like reality is simulated and isn’t really there. Its somewhat like being high, but without the visual aspect. I just feel so disconnected, like there’s a wire loose in my brain or something. It’s affecting my relationships. My focus has gotten worse and motivation went to shit. I haven’t had a good day in a long time. Rather it comes in hour long waves before going back to shit. I made another post and was told to look into PAWS, which is definitely what I’m experiencing.  

Another thing is the rush of emotions. Weed made me numb for so long, and I have a lot of underlying psychological issues I’ve never dealt with.  I’ve cried more these past 50 days than I did in the last 3 years. But it feels good. Something inside of me knows it’s important. I have to process this stuff before I can feel better. 

But I’m still 100% committed to my sobriety, and I’m proud as fuck of myself. I used to have dreams and goals. I have things I want to accomplish. This subreddit has helped a ton, and it’s amazing. I never posted on Reddit before this. I just lurked and read. But when I started to feel these awful symptoms, I was directed by people on here and given advice. I messaged multiple people who have dealt with this and they’ve helped calm me down a lot. 

To anyone else struggling with similar effects, here’s my advice I’ve gathered. 

1. This is a temporary feeling. I was so concerned I had done permanent damage to my brain and that I would feel like this forever. You won’t. Everyone I’ve talked to says it subsides with time. Some people lose symptoms after 6 months, some after 2 years. But no matter what, your brain will become normal again. 

2. Your brain is going through some serious changes. If you don’t know what brain plasticity is, I recommend you look into it. For me, my brain was soaked in THC for 2 years. It was used to getting its dopamine from weed. There’s a hole in my brain that was filled with weed for the longest time. It now needs to adjust and learn to enjoy normal things. My mental reward system needs to reset. 

3. Give your brain the time and space it needs. Don’t substitute other drugs to fill the void. I’ve struggled with this a bit and have definitely been drinking more, but I’m working on cutting that back as well. Get good sleep, eat healthy, exercise, and stay motivated. Keep momentum going. 

4. Lastly, give your brain the exercise it needs. I’ve been taking class serious again for the first time in awhile and it helps a lot. Reading as well, as it stimulates your brain. 

Sorry for the long post. I had never really used Reddit, but I’ve posted in here multiple times and have found a lot of support and guidance. It’s really awesome to see. I’ll continue to update, and I’ll see you guys at day 100 :) feel free to message me if you need anything!",10

2019-11-24 19:18:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e17jjy/the_power_of_a_definitive_decision_for_relapsers/,The power of a Definitive Decision. (for relapsers especially.),"I would like to share the single, simple thing that helped me stop smoking forever: making One Definitive Decision. Though this was several years ago, I just recently found a book that supported my understanding of this powerful choice. I hope this can help others.

Recently, I read the book *This Naked Mind: Control Alcohol* by Annie Grace. I highly recommend it, even though I don't drink, and when I did, I never had problems or addictive tendencies with alcohol. I read the book at the request of a friend who is an alcoholic, who wanted me to be an accountability and support person. He wanted me to understand what he was going through by reading the book. I could relate very strongly through my experience with marijuana, even though popular wisdom says alcohol is addictive and marijuana isn't.

Anyway, in this book the author said something that struck me deeply. She said that when you make a decision to be sober for life, you make ONE DECISION.  ONE DECISION. One strong, clear, non-negotiable, solid, powerful but simple decision changes the course of your future reality forever, and then you don't have to re-consider it ever again.

On the other hand, when you tell yourself that you may one day be able to use again, or that you will use only sometimes, or that you will use ""lightly"" or ""moderately"", or that when such-and-such circumstances change you can go back to using, or any number of other variables that leave open the possibility of starting up again, a million other decisions line up and clutter the rest of your life.

When you leave the choice of using again hanging in the future, you have to engage with that choice on a *constant* basis. Every day, you will have the anxiety of wondering whether this is the day you might start again. Or whether this emotion, or this social crowd, or this situation justifies resuming your habit. Or whether a certain date at a certain time in future is when you give yourself permission to drink / smoke / use again. You are living in a gray zone where your decision is only as strong as your current mood and resolve.

The author says that the amount of emotional, psychic and mental energy that gets consumed by having to re-make this choice again and again, forever, is devastating for your nervous system. It leaves so much uncertainty, and therefore it strengthens anxiety and weakens confidence. You're never free - each day you need to confront:  Will I or Won't I?  It's exhausting.

The beauty of making one definite decision is mind-blowing. It explains so much about why I was miserable for so many years, trying to stop smoking marijuana but re-negotiating terms with myself. It also explains why I felt immediately liberated, energized and truly relieved when I finally stopped (2,241 days ago) even though the yearning for that habit took some time to fade. I hope this perspective helps.",50

Its been a real inhibiting factor in my life and has caused me to miss out on opportunities to improve my life. Whats worse is I think I'm a bit depressed right now and being high all the time just seems to amplify that.   


I've been trying to quit unsuccessfully for about a month now. I feel like its a lack of commitment on my part. So I'm creating this post as a way to materialize my intention I guess. I also don't have many friends or people that support me much at the moment so I'm kinda feeling alone in this.

2019-11-24 16:24:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e14yjj/50_days/,50 days,"2 weeks ago I submitted [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dukwmi/what_happened/)(really long) post here about how I experienced a really bad panic attack while high and how I felt afterwards. In a nutshell, it gave me extremely bad anxiety to the point where it was super hard for me to function, whereas before I only had mild social anxiety and functioned well.  

I still have a few of the symptoms listed on the post, mainly 

&#x200B;

* Derealization / depersonalization 
* Emotional Sensitivity
* Intrusive / obsessive thoughts
* Over analyzing / hyperawareness
* Self doubt

So definitely a huge difference between the original post. Despite having so little symptoms compared to before though, it's still frustrating to have them, I've become like a sponge emotionally. I tend to absorb the feelings' of my loved ones around me and cry super easily at anything- too much empathy? if that's even a thing. I'm afraid of my own feelings at times if they're too strong since I associate it with losing my marbles.  

What is really helping me right now is CBT therapy, which is short of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, what it is (from what I understand)  it’s talk therapy that changes the way you think and feel about anxiety / negative emotions, it also teaches you to think about problems realistically and basically to not make a chicken out of a feather. 

It sounds really simple and like it wouldn't work but I really recommend it, I wish I had tried it sooner and not doubted it. 

I got a book co-authored by the psychiatrist that invented this therapy (Aaron T.Beck) and it's helping tons, to the point where I only really have anxiety very rarely during the day. 

The book is called ""The Anxiety & Worry Workbook: The Cognitive Behavioral Solution""  
Its helping me a lot and definitely worth checking out if you have anxiety. 

I'll keep updating every 2-3 weeks or so, I apologize if that's too much lol. My dms/chat is open to anyone with questions.

Thank you for reading",5
2019-11-24 16:14:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e14t08/my_journey_through_heavy_withdrawals/,My journey through heavy withdrawals,"Figured i’d share my story to help myself and whoever can relate... 

I just turned 20 and I had been smoking all day everyday weed, wax, live resin you name it for the last 3 years. I’ve always been a big believer in the benefits of weed, even got my parents to begin using it. 

It all started about 2 months ago. Smoked all day like usual, when late at night something took over my head. Heart racing like crazy, legs shaking, very much panicking. Obvious signs of a panic attack, but I have never experienced something along those lines. That night was one of the scariest nights of my life as I couldn’t even fall asleep without thinking I would stop breathing. 

The next day I visited the walk-in where they determined everything to be normal, blood work etc all came back fine. Weeks prior I was debating quitting smoking but I was so dependent on it I could never see my life without weed. I figured it was time to stop, but how could I stop if I felt nauseous all day until I could smoke, it was the only thing I had to look forward to. I wasn’t even getting high at that point it was just something I had to do in order to carry on my daily routine. 

Days to follow I continued to smoke, very lightly but these times I seemed to be getting higher than ever, strange. I would smoke 2 puffs of a joint and felt higher than I ever would after smoking 3 dabs of live resin back to back. I had actually came across this page and decided it was officially time to quit. Seeing other posts gave me hope that it was possible for me. 

Unfortunately ever since that first panic attack, I haven’t felt myself since. The first week was definitely the worst in terms of withdrawals, I wasn’t eating, sleeping, constant nausea. I’ve been struggling heavy with anxiety, panic attacks, something I’ve never dealt with before in my life, blurred vision, troubles concentrating, muscle pains, heart pulsations, heavy breathing anxiety, dizziness, random tingling in feet, hands, circulation being cut very easily, you name it i’m going through it. I realize this is caused by the high amounts of THC I was smoking daily, I just never knew something like that could take over my life and have me feeling as awful as I do. 

It’s now been about 2 months since I last smoked and the days are going by and i’m not feeling any better unfortunately. Some days are better than others, but most days I don’t feel like doing anything. Everything is a challenge, it almost comes in heavy waves. I try working out but I just constantly struggle with my vision and dizziness. I’ve been prescribed an anxiety medication to help aid with the random panic attacks and they seem to help, but I understand they’re very addicting and that’s the last thing I want to get hooked on after quitting smoking. I am familiar with PAWS and have read similar posts from people dealing with similar symptoms, which gives me hope knowing it’ll get better over time, but everyday is a struggle mentally trying to beat this whole situation. I’m still young, have always been in good health and never thought something like this could happen to me. I feel like the hardest part is trying to enjoy regular everyday activities without smoking. I know overtime I will find the beauty in things once again, but right now times are tough and no ones to blame but myself. My advice to people, quit while you’re ahead because I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone, it’s truly taken over my life. 

I’d love for people to weigh in on their own experiences, if they’re at all similar, if anything’s improved etc. I just can’t wait to get back to my everyday life and enjoying the things I love to do. 
Cheers!",3

I used to really enjoy weed but I know that doing psychedelic drugs can make your highs a lot scarier and full of anxiety, and that's definitely been happening to me in the past year or so. When I'm high I feel incredibly anxious, self-conscious, and isolated and wary of the people around me. 

I am going through a lot of mental things and having a hard time holding myself up a lot of the time. This could be because of the weed. Last semester, I fell into a really bad depression where I'd stay in my room all day and watch Hulu. I quit my job (which was actually contributing to my depression) and I didn't leave the room much at all except for going to class, which I very often went to in pajamas. It felt like there was absolutely nothing to my life, and it's still very hard for me to think about that time or read my old journal entries. The only person who I felt truly helped and understood me and was there for me at the time was my counselor, but back then my school had a ten session policy for all four years- meaning you could only see a counselor for ten times through the four years at school (they changed it over the summer fortunately). 

I didn't smoke the entire summer (except like once) and did a lot with myself. I worked as a camp counselor, and while it was really difficult and emotionally demanding and I struggled a lot to connect with the other counselors around me, I grew a lot as a person and got through my problems by being patient and letting things pass.  It wasn't an easy summer and it wasn't a fun summer and I felt empty and struggled with a lot but I did grow a lot from it. 

I'm back at school now, and when I first started, I only smoked when I was invited to. But I bought a new bowl and things started getting really rough and a lot of my friends smoke, so part of hanging out would be smoking together. 

I trust some people when I'm high but others make me very wary. Being high also makes me very anxious and sad, and it makes me feel like I'm being weighed down by all of my problems and really realize the impact of things I'm feeling. It's hard having all of that and not knowing what to do with it. I've been writing in my journal a lot lately, but sometimes I need genuine human connection and I don't always feel like I have that. 

I quit for a week because I got very drunk last Saturday and texted a guy who I like very much and made him overwhelmed and not want to talk to me and my friend got dragged into it bc he was with me and I told him not to let me text people. This really painful and negative experience made me reevaluate my life and how much I let in things that hurt me. I decided I'd quit for two or more weeks (lol) and I also went off social media for a bit. 

While it was hard being away from these things, I really did feel like I was able to focus on things and deal with my problems in a more healthy way. Writing more about my problems in my journal instead of posting long paragraphs to my finsta, for example, really felt better. Also, when I wasn't high, I could do so much more. I got a lot of work done and I felt a lot more in touch with myself and like much more of a patient and understanding person, which are two things I've always liked about myself. 

I got high last night and got into an argument with my friend. We've since worked it out, but it was the type of argument that could've potentially ended ugly and ruined a friendship, and this left me alone with my dark thoughts and I felt like all the progress I made was fake, and that I was just really good at lying to myself about feeling ok, which hurt. 

I don't want to quit because so many of my friends smoke and there are places I go where it's 100x more fun if you're high, but being high brings out a lot of bad thoughts and feelings that are bigger than me. I just don't know.",3

Struggling hard,"Before this I had used weed as a way to deal with my anxiety and depression, which obviously never works, and decided to quit and tackle it head on as I’m going to be moving across the country in 2 months to be with my fiancé. But I’m so fucking anxious. To the point I’m second guessing my move. Which is horrible because I was supposed to make this move 4 months ago, he got here, I thought I could just stop smoking no problem, flipped out (even tho I was still smoking some) and canceled. It was awful. I don’t want that to happen again. When I’m sane all I think about is him and how much I want to be with him. I’ve been so upset at my self for cancelling and missing so many holidays with him etc. but when I feel like this I feel so genuinely terrified of making such a big life change. I’m young and I’ve never lived away from home or been away from my immediate family for more then a week or two I feel like I’ll never be truly ready because of how much of a wreck I am.

- I filled that spot back up with cues for healthy alternatives. (running shoes, yoga mat, dog leashes)

- In the spot where I used to keep my bud, I’m now keeping a journal. I’m somewhat of a writer, so my plan is to make one journal entry and do one 15 minute writing exercise a day. 

- I have been training MMA 3 times a week consistently for a little over 3 months. I plan to step that up to 5 times a week for the foreseeable future, as it’s a tremendous release for me. 

- I bought an app called “Grounded” which is what inspired this post. It recommended that I become part of a community, and referred me here. I’ll be posting screenshots, progress notes, and any questions or concerns here at r/leaves. Thank you all for creating such a wholesome community, and for allowing me to take part. 

I’ve told my wife that I’m going to quit so many times that she no longer believes me when I say it. I don’t blame her at all. So I don’t plan to tell her this time initially. She is so accustomed to me going outside to my spot on an almost hourly basis that she will not suspect anything when I go outside to journal instead of get high. I will tell her I quit after 2 successful weeks of abstinence. 

I love my wife more than anything else in this world. She makes me a better person, and I just want to make her proud as she makes me by rising to my full potential. 

In spite of my smoking habit, I’ve managed to build a successful business with my skills. I have lots of opportunity looking me dead in the face. It’s up to me to seize it. I need my wits about me to do that. Quitting smoking will make it 1000% easier.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thanks again for building this wonderful community. 

tl;dr - I have a solid plan, wish me luck.",2

This will probably be long but I need to get it out.

Quitting was hard, so very hard. However it actually inspired my stoner friends to quit as well as we all knew lazing away stoned af unable to think isn't the way to live.

Thankfully didn't relapse during that time, however after 5 months after being off of it, my depression was still there and quite active. I go to therapy every week and I even mentioned nothing I expected to change by quitting did. I was still experiencing executive dysfunction like symptoms and I had so much stress I actually gained a lot of weight. 

She told me I was being a lot more productive etc so I took her word for it.

A bit later I decided to say fk it and got some weed to experiment. I tend to push my own limits so I suppose this test was to see how I'd do once I ran out.

It was fine! I had no desire to buy more, I wasn't freaking out and I felt like it was a nice vacation from my thoughts. Back to sober.
 
Soon after that I was put on ritalin I started to finally see a difference, then due to issues I couldn't get any for a couple weeks. This is when I first truly relapsed. I'm fairly sure I used it as an excuse. I was depressed and bored and anxious and figured weed would at least help the boredom. I don't drink or enjoy any other forms of intoxication so I went for ol faithful. 

The first time high I felt so lost. I disassociated a bit but I guess that's what I wanted out of it. I won't deny that I have trauma I'm dealing with. Also weed + Ativan = 0 memory.

Fast forward a week and a half later and the eighth was gone and I felt no desire to have more. Cool.

Then a couple weeks go by and I cave in again. This time at the end I'm scraping my bowl for that one last high, you know how it goes.

3 times now. I just ran out again a few days ago, and I'm struggling. My friends also took my lead and are smoking ""responsibly"" 

I feel guilty, and while I know I can quit I'm struggling finding reasons why. Empty nights are harder to deal without it right now. It's so easy to light up and escape.

Just needed to vent, thank you all for being here. For reference I smoked for about 7 years starting super slow and getting into all day high for the last 2.

No matter how strong you think you are, addiction will always be stronger. Trust me, I'm one of those crazy willpower folk, quit nicotine at the same time as weed!",6

I'd like to share my story. It's not a story the vast majority of people will experience, because I am an addict, and have abused weed (and other substances) for a long time. I'm at Day 77. I can without a doubt say that this has been one of the wildest rides to date. Sometime about 5 years ago, I gave up cannabis for what I thought was for good, but like many others, I made excuses and came right back. Little did I know that my addictive nature and mental health was -- and has been for a long while -- in the garbage. At least hindsight is 20/20, right? 

5 years ago, I made a move across the country to start a new job, and left everything behind. The stress was tremendous, going through withdrawal after withdrawal panic attack the first week at work was a nightmare. It took what I felt was months to fully recover, but instead of recover, I explored alcohol and never fully sought help for my addiction. After withdrawing from alcohol, I caved into abusing food, packing on about 80 pounds of weight. Then, when things felt like they were all good, I caved and picked up smoking weed again after a family vacation to Colorado. I was doing everything in my might to avoid the painful path of recovery. I just never could live the sober life, I never could feel comfortable with myself.

Fast forward two more years and here we are, withdrawing again.  

In month two, between days 30 and 60 and after the initial acute withdrawal (which honestly wasn't so bad), I had the wildest ride of this fiasco, waking up nightly in sweats, unable to sleep, terrible panic attacks at night, and horrible morning anxiety. I would have terrible rumination and feelings like I wasn't going to make it. I was having reactive hypoglycemia after eating carby meals, getting shaky and weak only two hours after eating anything, but my blood sugar was normal. I ended up going to an endocrinologist and my blood sugar was dipping low at night, which is an indicator that my adrenals were toast. In addition, my digestion was shot, and my stool was not healthy at all. I had trouble digesting fats, so I added a digestive enzyme to my regimen. Eating any kind of carbs sent me into wild mood swings, and made the anxiety and panic worst, so I began eating only carbs from whole food sources such as veggies and lentils. I would rest a lot, and even though I know exercise can be restorative, I had to keep it to long walks only. Trying to go for jogs or even doing bodyweight exercises too vigorously left me bed-ridden for the entire next day with anxiety and food intolerance.

Withdrawal from cannabis this time has been reminiscent of alcohol withdrawal PAWS, extremely intense and debilitating. However, I've adapted, and have gotten better. In the last two weeks, I've seen light at the end of the tunnel. I'm nowhere near healed, as I still get intense waves of symptoms, but I can certainly see progress, and I have full days with only minor anxiety and other symptoms.

Now, I'm at day 77 in and still experience all sorts of strange PAWS symptoms, but they are less than in month two. I attribute this to being quite strict with my diet and taking it SUPER easy. Stress can destroy a person. Adrenal fatigue is a real thing, and withdrawal can send your body into a fragile state. My current symptoms are general anxiety, insomnia (though I can sometimes get 4 hours at a clip instead of waking up every hour now), blurry vision, head pressure, and carb intolerance. My digestion is still not great, but probiotics, strict diet higher in fats, veggies (6 or more servings a day!) and proteins, and digestive enzymes have been a life saver. I'm finally feeling like I'm healing, and I'm so damn thankful. I've also started seeing a therapist again, and that has been great since I don't have the best friend support network at my immediate disposal. In addition, I journal, and I've been communicating with others on this subreddit daily through PM as a means of venting and healing. I'm so incredibly grateful for this subreddit -- without you guys, I'd be lost.

Thanksgiving is approaching, and any of you going through addiction and withdrawal, I wish you a loving holiday. Feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to. It can make all the difference. I know we can heal, but we can't do it alone, especially those of us with addictive tendencies.",10

Then when I glanced at the test questions and realized how difficult they actually are I got so overwhelmed. After spending 8 of 12 hours with my head in the books and eyes on a computer screen, and feeling like I didn't know anymore than I did when I started, I got so discouraged. For the first time since I quit I wanted to get high so bad. But logically I know fogging up my brain will do me no favors and could be detrimental to my success. So I closed the books, turned off my laptop, and went to the mall. I'm hesitant to ""reward"" myself so early on in both these journeys, but I needed the pick me up so I treated myself to some nice bath products and a new outfit for my date tomorrow.

Unfortunately, I can't have the fun high. Oh well. I can have fun with other things in life.

The important lesson here: Males with a history of anxiety disorders (like me) are at extremely high risk of this condition. Don't smoke weed if you have an anxiety condition.

Don't let the brain make you feel you have succeeded already, it will get you back on the smoking again! Remind yourself to be Humble still! It's good for the process

2019-11-23 04:45:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e0fu78/my_view_on_marijuana_withdrawals/,My view on Marijuana withdrawals,"Hey fellow leavers.

I've been very active here recently unlike ""previous quitting attempts"" - mainly because I finally feel like I have a good understanding and hold of what it is to not smoke marijuana.
I made this throwaway my main account and I am only subbed to leaves. 
I'd like to share a few thoughts about what I think withdrawals are and how to face them.

I've experienced in the past terrible withdrawls. I've had the worst night sweats and unimaginable insomnia (I remeber once being up for 4 days straight, shaking, only to fall asleep for 2 hours wake up covered in sweat and curse myself for ever being an addict)
Nausea that lasted weeks and a sense of dread and depression that didn't leave me at all during months of abstinence.
I was bound to fail because I refused to see the change I was doing.

I was focused in the past on one thing - quitting weed.

Yes, quitting weed is what we are doing - but it does not define who we are.

Quitting marijuana is a multi layered issue.
You are breaking up a habit you form over months or years for some, you're disengaging from a certain physical and mental state and accepting a new one.
The way you go about it is how it will be for you.
It sounds so easy right? It is. 

The first thing I invite you all to ponder about is this - If marijuana is such a negative thing that you are here quitting, how does the idea of not smoking feel or seem so bad? 

Yes, it's a very basic point of view 
""I'm quitting weed, weed is a negative influence in my life - not being high is my new high, it is what I really want"" 
You need to understand that you've reached a point where marijuana is something you don't want to do. 

So what is a craving? Are you craving to go back to smoking a joint or vaping so you can once again feel guilty and want to stop? 

When you really think about it, it's a  ridiculous notion. 

You step out of the cloud of smoke and feel bad that you are free? 
No, embrace is my fellow leavers - the moment you decide to stop using is the moment you are no longer using. 
The moment you are no longer using is pure happiness, you are achieving what you wanted so badly. 

What follows doesn't matter. 
You can't sleep? It's okay, you can be calm and relaxed because sleep wil eventually return. Use the extra time to learn, come here and support others and yourself. 

You can't eat? That's fine, your digestion needs time to adjust and get going again. 
Don't be afraid if you can't down a burger and fries - you'll enjoy it in the future again and much more. 

You feel bad? What about it, you felt bad when you were smoking daily so perhaps it's okay to feel bad, it will pass. 
Maybe you don't even feel bad you're just convincing yourself this is hard and therefore bad. 


When you start shifting your view point you will notice something different about the withdrawals - they are not all that you set them out to be, they are actually so minor and insignificant on the grand scale of things. 

You need to view the process of quitting for what it really is - a positive change, a challenge that will make you stronger and better than you are. 
Something worth having is not meant to be easy to get. 

There is a wonderful book called ""The Obstacle is the Way"" by Ryan Holiday.
It's not about addiction, it's actually a simplified introduction into stoicism - a philosophy that I think is very helpful for this process of quitting an addiction and generally a good way of viewing life.

""Scratch the complaining. No waffling. No submitting to powerlessness or fear. You can't just run home to Mommy"" he says, got me there he did... Mommy for us is Marijuana right now.

Sometimes we have to do hard things but it is the way we go about doing them that shapes how we perceive them.

""We take weakness for granted, We assume that the way we're born is the way we simply are, that our disadvantages are permanent. And then we atrophy from there"" - and for us this addiction is such a big weakness. 

I suggest reading this book, you can't sleep much anyways why not use this time to learn some new concepts? It's not a big book, I'm not a good reader in fact I haven't actually read any books in the last 10 years but I managed to get through this one quite fast. 

Lastly a piece of advice for anyone struggling with nausea because it is real. 
Giving your digestion a break is key to letting it heal fast. 

Stop forcing down foods, stick to very light meals. 
I did oatmeal and protein powder shakes for a few days, I even used vegan protein because it simply digests easier than milk based ones. 
Avoid fat - it's hard on your stomach. 
My digestion is back on track since a while ago, yesterday I treated myself to lunch in my favorite resteraunt and it was so good - it even cost me less than my daily habit used to, ha. 

Insomnia? A calm mind is key. 
I'm sleeping so good and it's only been... What, 14 days? I relapsed for a few days in between but it didn't even matter because it made me realize my folly, the first night after the relapse I went to sleep like a baby without marijuana - it was because the relapse is what made me understand this is it, this is me really quitting weed and making a positive change. 
It's been 5 or 4 days now I don't count really and I don't even sweat anymore. 

I'm not weak and that feeling...invites calmness, calmness invites sleep. 

Hope you're all doing good. 
This is not the end of something it's the start of everything that is worth having in your life. 

Peace!",83

&#x200B;

So i had been smoking weed everyday for almost 8 years. With two moderately long breaks from it that lasted a few months. However I would have a drink almost every day and I also smokes sigarets. A few months ago I found the strenght to quit weed and even decided to go to therapy. My record without weed is like 40 days? This was while i was waiting to get treatment. During treatment it was OK i guess, i had some gliders. 

As you might understand by now... I started daily smoking again. A couple of weeks ago. I know I should quit and I have a lot of reasons to. But everytime I tell myself ''now is the right time''. My mind immediatly starts thinking... ''if i can't do it ill be able to buy weed then and then''. I also don't think therapy is really working for me. 

It's really annoying to continue to do something you know you shouldn't. It occupies a lot of my mindspace. I just don't feel strong enough, eventhough I have so many good reasons to quit. I think I am a weak person... Why can't I just quit?",2

2019-11-22 22:23:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e0caw0/29_years_sober_some_hope/,2.9 Years Sober - Some Hope,"I read u/bananananBanana 's post and all the comments. I wanted to write to so many of you who commented and are struggling. But really, I want to say the same thing to each one of you. It felt easier to do it this way. 

The misery you’re wading through right now - there is a way out, and it’s not suicide. A lot of us here have found a way to go a day without getting high. A week, a year…for me, I’ll have three years in a few weeks. 

I want to tell you how I got sober so that maybe you see a path to get out of this shit spiral. And I want to tell you what it’s like to have the monkey off my back to give you a bit of hope. Separating this out because it’s kind of long…

**Out of Shit Spiral**

It started when I went to my first AA meeting. I talked to the people, told them about my problem, and some of them welcomed me. I kept going. It was such a relief to not have to lie for just an hour… Outside of these meetings, I wasn’t admitting to anyone how often I was getting high, and the lengths I was going to make that happen. When people talked about being sober, or celebrated one year sober, I just fucking wept in the back of the room. I talked to these AA people about how unfair it was that they were able to get well because they had a real addiction - since my problem was pot, I believed that the AA program wouldn’t work for me, and my problem wasn’t legitimate enough for me to get help. 

At that point, I was still getting high every day. But I was opening up to people. Opening up to people at AA helped me see what was really going on. Instead of avoiding the reality of my situation, I was acknowledging it…even just for that one small part of the day. 

And…. I felt a lot worse. “I’m terribly addicted, I can’t stop, there’s no help” etc. That misery and desperation drove me to call up rehabs. I wanted a physical, forced separation from pot. 

Luckily, I was still on my parents insurance and was able to get into a rehab. (If you don’t have insurance and can’t afford rehab, I have some links for you below). Rehab HELPED! Still, there was more work ahead for me. 

My problem was twofold: 1) every time I got high, I craved more - “stopping” was really really difficult, 2) I used pot for so many feelings and activities (sad, mad, excited, “feeling empty”, to wash dishes, to vacuum, etc., etc.). Rehab treated #1 and gave me room to treat #2. 

The second piece is difficult, and it takes awhile. To address it, I went to AA (also NA, CA, and MA) and therapy. I learned about mindfulness and started meditating. I read Thich Nhat Hanh and Pema Chodron, and listened to Jon Kabat-Zinn’s guided meditations on Youtube. When I just couldn’t deal, I binge watched Netflix and ate ice cream and donuts and french fries (careful with that one - I gained 70 pounds!). 

Yeah, okay, it’s hard work to get sober - and harder still to stay sober. But I’ll tell you this: the closer you are to the last high, the harder it is. So if you got high this morning, tonight is harder than tomorrow morning will be. There are exceptions to this, but overall this theory holds. 

**Bit of Hope**

At (almost) three years, here’s what has happened for me: I got a real, full time job. And then I got promoted - TWICE! I have money! (Before I got clean, all of my bras were broken and wires would poke into me and I had to duct tape my bras to “fix” them. Now, there is not a single bra in my drawer with exposed wire.) I go on dates. Sometimes, even, second and third and fourth dates. I have great sex! I’m, like, a *lady*. I didn’t feel like a lady - or human, even - when I was getting stoned. Everything was dirty, broken, achey, burnt… you know the drill). I found out that there are things I like (hiking! Cooking! Seeing stand up, going to restaurants…). That’s a really cool part of getting sober: exploring. Finding out what you like. (AA meetings are awesome for meeting people to explore with.) Anyway, I’m rambling now. The point is, life is really good. I feel kind of teary right now honestly - back at day one, I didn’t think I could ever have this. Not that my life is so remarkable (my car is super beat up, I don’t love my job). But, you guys, I’m free. And you can be free, too. 

**What Now?** 

When you decide you want to be sober, what it really boils down to is not getting high in this moment, right now. Ask: “if I get high right now, how will that change the situation?” Maybe it’ll make you feel a little better. But what then? Has anything actually changed? Rate the craving/intensity on a 0-5 scale. Make a note: Friday 10:15 PM, urge — 4.5. Then distract yourself, practice a different kind of escapism. Watch something on TV. After awhile, check the clock. Check your urge. Write it down. More escapism, then check urge, write down… The point here, is — look, the urge changes. 

If you fall off, get back on, friend. Pop on here. Talk to people. 

I don’t know you and your specific situation. But man, I know that feeling. If you’re trying to quit, or thinking about quitting, that’s brave. And hard. I believe in you, and I’m proud of you for the effort you’re putting it. After you get through this, there’s going to be a guy or gal just like you who feels alone and helpless. You’re gonna know what to say to them, you’re going to make them feel less alone and give them hope… if nothing else, do this for them. They need you.

2019-11-22 21:37:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e0brjh/first_day_long_post/,First day (long post),"[TLDR]: dude relies on weed too much, and is attempting to not do that. 

Approaching 24 hours without the herb. I have been a habitual daily user since freshmen year of high school (currently 27 years old). Tolerance breaks over the last 14 years rarely lasted more than a week or so before I’d fall right back into the usual daily habit.  When I was younger I didn’t see much issue with my usage. Despite being high through most shifts and classes I always did well enough at work and in school. The past year and half were really where I’ve noticed the influence my habit has had over my life and overall happiness.

I used weed when I was happy, sad, depressed, frustrated, and any other time that I could get away with it. It always seemed to enhance my enjoyment of social gatherings and date outings with my S/O (she is also a habitual user of marijuana). However, in retrospect, the truth of the matter does not align with what I believed to be the truth throughout the years.

Looking back, it seems I would plan nearly my entire existence around getting high. I would have to do it before going out with friends or family. I would select particular social gatherings over any other options if I knew I would be able to smoke with those I was planning on seeing. Not only that, but I would do it before work or on my lunch break to help “get through the day”. Or, before classes because I figured I’d just be sitting through a lecture anyways so I mind as well be high while I do it. All of this just to get home as quick as possible, and to get high again before doing anything else. 

All this time I’ve felt like I was providing myself with a means of therapy when in reality I was allowing myself to be directed by a habit that seems to have control over my emotional wellbeing. Now when I am high, I do nothing but sit and internally bash myself for any shortcomings I experience professionally and personally. Instead of dealing with those feelings, I would rather allow a depressive, vegetative state, illuminated by the glare of the tv in my living room overcome my entire existence until it was time to get up and start the cycle over the next day. This has been the case for the past two years.

Lately, I’ve noticed how much I rely on marijuana to get by, or, how often I use it as a means to have something to look forward too. Which is why I’ve decide to remove myself from that cycle and break the stigma I have of myself being a lifetime pothead. 

I have read through a great number of posts in this sub over the past few weeks. I never really knew how to describe the purgatory I’ve placed myself in all these years before seeing so many others describe shockingly similar feelings, habits, and experiences. I was not planning on posting, but of course, once I got off work today I instinctively began desiring the numbness I would typically provide myself with at that time of the afternoon. So instead of coming home, petting my dogs and burning one down; I am instead petting the doggers and typing out this long post to you peeps. 

Some of the less savory details describing the lengths I’ve gone to to get weed over the years have been omitted from this post because I’d rather it not be a source of negativity for anyone who happens to read this bad boy. But like many others here, my stuberness and determination to procure this substance has ultimately resulted in a shameful outlook of what has really been more than half of my entire life. 

So, if you’ve made this far, that’s cool and I appreciate your time. If you’re also attempting to quit, feel free to shoot me a comment or message; I’m usually down to talk to whomever about whatever. There seems to be a great deal of support in this sub and I feel as if my similarities with many others here warrant any type of collaboration and support I could offer anyone else. I’m also interested to hear about what habits others have used to enjoy their time on this rotating rock as they progressed away from habitual use of marijuana. Also, if anyone else has quit and lives with someone who uses regularly; what were some ways you dealt with that exposure and were there ways you worked with your partner to ensure your success in renaming abstinent?

Thanks every one!

Cordially,

Lurkboticus",5

Today marks day 29 with officially having completed 4 weeks off of weed. Its been over four years since I've gone this long, and damn I can't believe I've done this. I've proved to myself what seemed so impossible at first could be done, and now having done it I feel better than I could have ever imagined. It hasn't been easy, and obviously I still have my bad days. I found  one of the hardest things for me was the fact that I attributed 100% of my mental health issues to be caused by my weed smoking, and once I stopped, obviously not all of them went away. When I stopped, I expected everything to instantly get better, instead of the absolute hell I faced the first two weeks. Stopping smoking did make confronting these issues a whole lot easier though. 

I have felt my anxiety slowly but surely trickling away, and I don't feel like I want to die the second I wake up every day. I've been dedicating more time to my passions, and am overall feeling so much more fulfilled in life.

I am still struggling to restructure my day-to-day lifestyle in a way that does not involve getting high constantly, and could definitely use some more advice regarding that. 

I just wanted to take this personal milestone as an opportunity to express the serious gratitude that I have for this sub. The support and feedback I've gotten has been overwhelmingly positive, and lurking on my bad days has made everything so much more bearable. When I wake up everyday I open up reddit and read on this sub for motivation and strength, knowing that others are dealing with the same dark shit I am. I've got so much love for all of you, and am eternally grateful for the support you have had to offer.

I’m recovered from Anorexia, have bipolar disorder (am grateful for my medication, used cannabis previously to deal before my meds) and have a background of abuse and love addiction. To say I have an addictive personality is an understatement. I just sometimes really struggle with this reality, feeling like it’s not fair that other people can just use recreationally and not get “hooked”. Lately I just think about going home and getting high when I’m at work (as a “reward”) but then after I do I regret it and get nothing done. I’m not moving toward my goals of running my own coaching business and I just feel defeated. How do you deal with this feeling of it not being fair? Alcohol and I don’t get along that great hangover wise so it doesn’t hook me the same way. However I get awful brain fog hangovers after smoking weed but I still make reasons to use. I guess I just need some support bc I really want to kick this coping mechanism and go after my dreams FOR REAL.

Still struggling with depression but I know for a fact it’s because I’ve been drinking more often and consuming other drugs. Last weekend I realized that I need to do this sober. I need to be straight edge until my brain can fully recover and heal from the damage I caused it. Otherwise this whole no smoking thing is just detrimental to my growth. Coming to this realization was hard because i like being under the influence. Even if it’s just caffeine. But I need to go on this straight edge journey. Whenever I’m fucked up on alcohol, I become everything I don’t want to be. You know, I thought I needed drugs and alcohol for me to become who I wanted to be. It gave me a bit of edge to my personality and gave me that fuck it mentality. Ive has that mentality since I graduated high school. I’m 25 now.

And the thing is, i know how I should be dealing with my life, but i just don't care enough to make those changes, i feel so unmotivated to do so.

i used to keep the weed smoking to only during the nights, but as the weeks have passed by, i've been doing it in the early mornings, afternoons and its actually kind of scary how psychologically, its consumed me, my daily routine. i think back to my past experiences with falling into this cycle, and i know deep down that i CAN pull myself out of this rut i'm in because i've done it before, but fuck it feels especially hard. it feels like that girl who pulled herself out of that black pit in the past is someone who i want to be, but it feels like an impossible goal for me to reach.

i haven't smoked much weed today because i didn't have any. i mean, i scraped what i could to have a bong if that counts but truthfully, this is the most sober i've been in a while, and i've had so many thoughts flood my mind and it made me realise just how much shit i'd been repressing overtime. It feels so overwhelming and it makes me really want to go buy some weed because it feels like too much to deal with, but then the other part of me is like ""this isn't serving me. this isn't good for you. you're so much better and stronger without it. you can do this.""

my closest friend is also in the same boat as me, we both want to quit but we both also feel that strong temptation to smoke weed. it isn't helpful for either of us. ANYWAY, reading through this sub reddit makes me feel better knowing other people struggle with a similar thing, so figured i'd give this a try.",25

I am currently one day 21 of sobriety! I had smoked constantly for about a year, stopped for a few months, and picked it up again.  I'm finally back to being sober.  I think the biggest thing I am dealing with right now if learning how to deal with my mental state. I have an anxiety and panic disorder that I used to tame by smoking. My way of coping was mainly just smoking myself into a coma daily. Now that I am sober - I am trying to learn how to deal with my disorder, as well as everything I ignored in the past due to my drug use. I've been reading again and quite a lot. I've also been trying to pick up new hobbies (rollerblading, cooking, etc.) and I just wanted to ask you guys for some advice or tips. 

I don't want to go back to smoking - I know that I deserve my sobriety. But I am also drowning in my own anxiety and depression. I appreciate this community a lot and I am glad I am finally reaching out!",5

Right now I'm in a completely different state for rehabilitation which has helped with the cravings knowing I can't get it and I'm in a different environment.

My problem is that I seem to start craving after a few weeks of abstinence and wonder why that is. Even during my first four days of withdrawing, sweats, shaking, anxious,and paranoid I didn't really feel like smoking. I know it was because of the environment I'm in, but I still don't understand why that now I'm more comfortable in my situation I begin to crave it more and more. 

I've been working on creating new habits such as meditation and praying and they help in the moment, but I eventually crave again and repeat the meditation and praying process. I want to attend ma meetings, but in rehab we only go to aa and na meetings obviously. They do help me cope but most of the attendees just don't understand it and giggle when I tell them my DOC. Hence why I have a had hard time getting a sponsor present and past.

I don't want to relapse when I have to go back home, things are going to trigger me and I have a medical card so getting access is too easy for me. Any advice from people who have been sober for a while?",2

- My friends appreciate spending time with me more and vice versa

- I enjoy music and watching movies/TV way more than I did when I was stoned (and actually remember what happened in them)

- I've started the first meaningful relationship in years that isn't based on weed (or drugs in general)

- Work is so much more fulfilling and I've improved so much at my job and it's no longer a stress-fest I'm trying to get through so I can go home and smoke

- I'm more aritculate and better at expressing what I really want, a refreshing honesty that people are respecting (my paranoid stoned mind always kept everything bottled up)

- Sunsets

I'm 34 french male (sorry for the average english). I was smoking weed for 15 years, almost everyday, 50g a week at the most. I work from home so it was really easy to spend my entire day smoking, sometimes lighting my first one as early as 9AM.

Also, i'm with my gf for 10 years now, and we wanted a baby for about 2 years now, but it never happened. So we went to see her doctor to try to find out what was delaying her pregnancy. We both did some tests and i found out a few days ago that it was because of me. The results said that my use of cannabis greatly lowered the quality of my sperm, to the point where the chances she got pregnant were about \~1%.

Trust me, it's not an easy thing to process. We hear a lot of side effects about motivation, memory but i never thought it could lead to a sterile state. It (should) will go off with stopping entirely, and i'm very lucky to have a girlfriend (soon to be my wife, we're engaged since this summer) who understood and was even releaved to finally know the reason why should couldnt get pregnant.

I always knew i would have to stop at some point, but like a lot of cannabis users, i love smoking, i love weed. So it's been one week now, i stopped completely. I'm struggling with the withdrawals effects : big loss of appetite, night sweating, diarrhea and a global feeling of discomfort all day long, but it's worth it.

I just wanted to share this because some people might be in the same situation and don't understand why their gf can't get pregnant. This whole situation is almost changing my mind about weed legalisation.

Be proud, be strong, and maybe wait to have a bunch of children before trying to get back to a controlled use of cannabis. i'll be happy to answer any questions if you have any.

When will things be normal again? How much permanent damage?","Like title says, I smoked frequently, about daily, for around 2 and a half years. Not only was it frequent, but it was from around age 16-18. 

I always knew I was harming myself in the long run, I just didn’t care. I don’t have any cravings at all,  as towards the end it just wasn’t enjoyable and was giving me terrible anxiety. Honestly it was incredibly easy at first, I could barely notice. Sure I had the troubles sleeping at first and basic symptoms everyone has, but they weren’t too bad. But recently it’s gotten a lot worse. The depression, anxiety, and just not feeling whole. I feel like I’ll never have my personality or full brain function back.  I get terrible episodes of derealization and disassociation to the point where I’ll be convinced I’m in psychosis. 

I’ve read numerous articles and studies. While it’s well known that weed lowers cognitive function and memory, it’s also widely accepted that these side effects fade when you stop. However, it’s also worse when your brain is still developing. After almost 50 days, I still don’t feel 100%. I performed pretty well In high school despite smoking, and yet I feel like my mind is nowhere near as sharp as it was a couple years ago. I worry that I’ve done a lot of permanent damage. 

So, to those of you who are far in on your sober streak, what should I expect? Are any symptoms permanent, and how bad might the damage be? If not, how long until I’m back to “normal”? I’ve seen some say it should be a month max, while others say it can take up to a year.

I mean, as a former athlete and someone who prided myself on discipline and self control, I feel weak for posting and seeming like I am in search of approval or a ""pat on the back"" (really not what I am seeking here). Despite this, I also realize that some people out there are struggling with this more than I, and hopefully this will provide that small nudge and encouragement for someone.

I never had the desire to smoke while I was in grade school or even high school. I played football and basketball and associated those who smoked as lazy, undisciplined, and less driven - three things I didn't want to associate myself with (realized these assumptions were also not accurate). I started smoking the winter after graduating high school, and what started as a thing to do with my home boy, slowly turned into a daily routine I did by my lonesome (along with friends of course). Six years of smoking within the hour I woke up, to right before bed, I slowly started to change. My attitude, hobbies, mindset, everything really. 

I decided it was time for a change. I am finishing up my last term in college, and come December I will be graduating with a Bachelors in Marketing and Finance. I figured a degree doesn't do much good if I can't pass the pre employment piss test right?

I am currently on day 18 and I am already starting to see results. I am mentally quicker, more driven to workout and get back into my ""old"" hobbies, anxiety is starting to slowly go away, and smoking is on my mind less and less - maybe once a day if that. Most importantly (for me), I finally have dreamt again! Last night I had three dreams, which is more than I remember from the last 5 years combined! The coolest thing is, in one of my dreams last night I actually found a rig in my dads room and took a small hit... Immediately after I had realized what I had done and started kicking myself and telling myself how I had just ruined the last 18 days and have to restart.. Shortly after this, I woke up. Thinking it was real, I ran to where I found the rig in my dream to make sure I didn't fuck up.. 

There was such a strong emotional reaction to me messing up IN MY DREAM, that it really hit me... This isn't just some goal to quit, its something that deep down I realize I truly want to give up. I can't begin to express how happy I was this morning after waking up and feeling somewhat normal again. Again, I am only at day 18, but starting to feel less foggy mentally and getting back to the old me. I am excited to find out who I am today compared to 18 year old me. I am excited for growth, I am excited to build healthier relationships and habits. 

For those going through this, and for those who are contemplating it... FUCKING GET AT IT. I was using weed as a crutch, as something to numb me so I could stop being in my head, stop hurting, stop analyzing every aspect of my life.. Now to realize pot was the thing that was doing in the first place. I sincerely wish you all the best on this journey, and hope you too can come to a similar realization. This isn't just a goal anymore, it's the start of a new chapter in my life. One of my childhood bestfriends challenged me to see who will hold out the longest and really commit to this and its honestly made the world of difference. If anyone would like a quitting partner to help hold you accountable, please reach out and lets talk.

Thank you for your time and seriously, best of luck!",5

...You guessed it; It's sober George 😆!!!

So, anyway. Fun and frolics aside. And onto the topic at hand. 

Oh hang on a sec, firstly, a Netflix film recommendation: ""The Collapsed"" It's a Canadian post apocalypse genre film. I'm 14 minutes in and exited about it already 😀. I love end of the world scenario story's. 

Sorry for going off topic, but you've gotta mix things up from time to time, right?! 😉

Now... virtually no cravings or thoughts off smoking weed or drinking alcohol today, I'm sure it's crossed my mind at some point during the day. It's always in the back of your mind really isn't it? 

Maybe eventually I'll stop thinking about weed everday, but to be completely honest, I'm not holding my breath for that day to come. 

I mean, for example. I still think about my ex girlfriend at least once everyday. And we've been split up for 7 years now, lol 😁. 

It depends on how busy and occupied i keep my mind i suppose. But even on the busiest of days she crosses my mind at least once. 

Same thing with weed (and alcohol).
I mean, I've been smoking weed morning until night for over 20 years; i'm not just going to forget about such a big part of my life, am i now 😬. 

It's learning to live with and except ones short comings. Everyone has their cross to bare. And there's worse things to be than an addict, right! 

Peace out, take care and genuinely do your best. What else can one do?!

Another bonus- I slept AMAZING! My dreams were still vivid and lacking common sense but that’s a very small price to pay to be healthy again.

I am not using this as an excuse to pick up or smoke again any time soon because I know myself and know how precariously I have jury rigged my mental health with this plant. 5 years of daily use is a long time, especially from 17-22.

I feel like it hindered my progress in weed abstinence. I just realized that I’m not allowing my brain to fully heal by still taking other substances in place of weed.

I want it so badly. I am beyond ready for sobriety, but I am scared shitless of myself.

I had a horrific childhood. I almost committed suicide three times before I was 16 and then at 16 when I moved out I found cannabis and it saved my life. I love weed. I am crying right now as I type this. I love this plant. It does everything for me...but 12 years later that is the problem. I have done so much inner work, I know I could take care of myself but my shit is so deep and my emotions are SO STRONG that when it comes time to handle a big wave, a big something in life that starts rocking my world, I turn to cannabis immediately in my mind and its like an ear worm that just doesn't shut off. 
I am barely even able to try and rely solely on meditation or journaling or art therapy because as I am doing those things; trying earnestly with all of my heart to commit to what I'm doing there is a part of me, laughing at myself, because the truth is that weed would fix it immediately and so much better than I currently am. And that feels really true in the moment.
I'm also a mother and dealing with my kids, being good and patient and kind when they are being annoying or not listening, as children do-its so much easier to be what seems to be my best self for them when I have a little plant medicine on my side. 
I am recovering from a lifetime of pain. And I'm doing well. But I have bad days sometimes. I wake up in the morning sometimes feeling like the past is shrouding me and it hurts. Mentally and physically hurts, but life doesn't stop. My family still needs me to be the mom and do all the things. I LOVE being a mother and I want to be the absolute best for them at every moment. Its so hard to give up being peaceful and loving mostly all the time because I can get high in short bursts --and instead shakily fight back the past soberly because I get irritable and so so sad. My partner is also a toker and has zero plans to quit. He's not ready and I understand but then I know its available all the time and that makes it so much more difficult. 
I know in time that my coping skills will get stronger and the withdrawal symptoms will fade, my brain will heal and the journey will have been worth it...but i cant get passed 10 days and oh man... It makes me really disappointed in myself.

Its just so hard in the moment. Any tips for remembering the long term? Any tips for irritability? Does anyone out there have faith in me that I can do it?",9

I have the potential to be such a fantastic successful professional engineer one day, but i just throw it away day after day. 

I can tell every day that it is holding me back, forgetting what i did in the near past, sitting around trying to remember what i was doing only 5 minutes ago. It goes on and on which im assure you are aware.

It wasn't  always like this i used to be good at stuff, i could lift weights, i could go scuba diving, i could take my motorcycle to the track, i could completely dissassemble my car engine and perform an overhaul myself, over the past 3 years i gave it  up or sold nearly anything i had for cash when i didn't have enough to keep my use going. 

Ive just had enough or at least i have until I'm sitting down on the couch staring at the one thing i hate most after a very hard and long day at work. Its almost automatic, its like i can't help but just sit there and watch as i bring a lighter and billy up to my face, only moments later wishing that i hadn't.

Ive tried quitting  many times before, each time i failed there was much learnt about myself and my smoking behaviour.

I'm a musician, and I've spent most of my journey high as a kite because I really like how music sounds when I'm baked. Who doesn't, right? But MAKING music while high? That's a vice separate from the plant altogether.

At least that how it feels to me. Every time I've tried to go sober, I wind up cracking just shy of three months, usually for that exact reason. ""This would SLAP high"", etc., starts to bounce around in my mind, and then before I know it a month or five go by where almost everything I do is colored by a deep fog. And like yeah... I come out of it with a couple tracks, and I would be okay with it if I could keep it to a once-in-a-blue-moon happening, but I can't stop even when the initial burst of creativity and motivation wear off and I actively say I won't smoke tomorrow when I wake up... and then I do. Like 90 times.

Does anyone have any advice for feeling that creative \*edge\*, consistently, stone-cold sober?

I keep hoping it'll come back if I wait it out long enough, but I don't know what lies past the three-month mark.

&#x200B;

Another problem I have is that I somehow developed some crazy allergies last year that don't consistently respond to otc antihistamines, but weed seems to consistently desensitize my skin. I'm already seeing doctors and allergists about this, but if the reddit gods that be bless me today, maybe someone would know something insightful.

Edit: Yes, I've considered this could be withdrawal-related, but I find it unlikely I'd still be experiencing physical withdrawal symptoms months dry.

2019-11-21 00:14:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dzegwl/my_relapse_lasted_over_a_month_sigh_back_to_day_1/,My relapse lasted over a month. Sigh. Back to day 1. I’m TIRED.,"Was at almost 7 months and relapsed mid October. Here we are near the end of November and my relapse has lasted over a month. I pray it’s over. There were a few days were I was sober within this month time frame were I was trying to get back on the sober train but failed so I’ll just count it as one big relapse. 

I’m so done. I’m tired of waking up tired and not refreshed despite falling asleep in a high stupor the previous night at like 9 or 10pm. I’m tired of getting what I think is “feel good” sleep where I sleep more hours than when I’m sober, but in reality I’m just lying there in an unconscious high haze because I wake up more tired after more hours of sleep. I’m tired of waking up groggy with thoughts of “maybe I should just call in sick today” thoughts that never cross my mind when I’m not smoking. I’m tired of smelling like ash, I’m tired of being disconnected from everyone because when I’m in a phase of smoking daily I tend to keep it a secret. I’m tired of showing up to dates high and ruining any chance of connection with the girl I went on the date on because I’m too high to remember important details of her life that she shared with me prior. I’m tired of eating so much junk food and not sticking to my strict gym routine that I normally keep to when I’m living sober. I’m tired of risking losing my job because high me(even though I’m sober at work, If I smoked the night before the mind numbing effects linger) doesn’t have the short-term memory nor attention to detail to handle my current job that I have. I’m tired of having day 1’s all over again when I swore to myself the last joint I smoked was really the last one. I’m tired of buying new lighters after throwing away my last one thinking that I had quit. I’m tired of feeling like I’m putting the rest of my adult life on hold, when I’m about to be turning 30 soon and still don’t have any savings to show for it. I’m tired of being addicted. 

I want this to be the last quit. If I made it almost 7 months the last time I quit, then I really hope this last quit is for good. I learned more then enough lessons on this past relapse. Now I know that even if I quit for 5 years, the minute my lips hit the joint, I’ll be just as addicted and be stuck to the tight grip that weed has on my soul/mind. I know that viscerally now. Don’t be like me guys, trust me, even if you have 100 days, 800, days, it doesn’t matter. The minute you allow that THC back into your system, you will be slowly(and depending on how long you’ve been using you can become instantly addicted again) going back down the rabbit hole of being hooked. And In a matter of days, weeks, you’ll be just as hooked to weed as you were before your awesome streak. Now I know I must quit for good, but I have to take it one day at a time...Sharing for support and to encourage anyone else on a relapse or who has any sort of streak but is playing with the idea of moderation after they believe they have control..There is no control if you were once addicted. The only thing the day counter tells us is not how much control over the addiction we have, but how much healing we have attained from it. And you do gain self control, but if you relapse, that self control will evaporate quickly, because this weed drug is literally a destroyer of self control. Weed is literally the polar opposite of self control in the form of a substance/plant. Ok rant over thanks for reading guys.

Almost every smokes weed in my family. Some more heavily than others. Some grow it. Some use it ""medicinally"".

I could go on if I thought more about it, but I'll just be brief.

I was affected by my environment growing up. Every child is. No person is an island. Even adults are.

I've met an amazing girl who's really changing my life for the better, she told me she wouldn't have been interested in me if I'd have been a stoner bum.

If you want it, your life can get better after weed. It takes focus & discipline, but it's possible. Once the withdrawals are over & you've made it a few months, you'll not want to go back & when you do want to go back, you just remember why you're doing this.

Step one of my quit, delete dealers number.
Step two, throw all your paraphernalia out, or give it away.
Step 3 the hardest, not seeing a good friend for a while so I wouldn't be influenced.

I grew up in a home that embraced it and normalized it from an early age. Growing up I wanted no part of it, as I had witnessed firsthand the brokenness and disparity that lifestyle brings. I am a professional and have become a master at deception. I have talked to presidents of organizations, individuals with doctorates, and many whom I deeply respect, all while under the effects of Cannabis. None of them ever knew, and I know this because I would have be fired and disciplined immediately. I attempted quitting several times in the past, however, it always creeps back into my life to ease the stress and deep pain I have suffered. Most importantly, Cannabis drove a wedge between my wife and I, she has always despised it and never attempted to really understand it, the answer was always no - you must stop now. Yesterday she found out I had been smoking again and she openly admitted to hating her life. This wrecked me. Today I gathered some of my brothers and handed my stash over to them, repenting of my ways. I am now struggling with anger and frustration and I cannot find peace. This is particularly strange because I am always “the encourager” and the one who is optimistic about everything. I suppose I will trust in the process, knowing that this is a change that must take place. If there is any encouragement or practical wisdom you can share, I would deeply appreciate it, as I have no real support system or individuals to whom I can reveal my true struggle without consequence.",3

I've been a daily smoker for almost 3 years, smoking anywhere from 1-5 bowls a day. Some days its 1-2, other days it can exceed 5+ when I'm on edge and need something to distract myself. It started off being amazing - me enjoying the littlest things such as eating a piece of food or taking a shower. 

But for the better part of over a year, I do not remember when was the last time I was able to enjoy weed to the extent that I did before. I run an online business which terribly failed earlier this year, got kicked out of my school program, and had almost 0 support from my family to do anything other than school until most recently (and only my mother who still does not 100% understand). 

I have been ""ready"" to quit for so long as I definitely don't want to obstruct my lungs. One of my friends recently finished rehab for pyschosis induced by weed so that was definitely a slight scare. I recently just coughed up some black spots and this should be a deal breaker but I am honestly terrified of wanting to smoke so bad but sacrificing my physical and mental wellbeing for it. I've heard all the stories and I know it's definitely not worth it, I've wrote a list of multitudes of reasons of why its not. 

However my excuse is usually that I have too much shit going on with my life and me completing a lot my things on my daily to do list makes my mind ""justify"" that smoking is okay. This is a really corrupt mindset that led me to smoking during work, and regular errands/tasks. 

I'm worrying and anxious about the time that needs to pass for my brain to detox and repair itself... I seriously need to find a hobby to pass time outside of working 24/7 but it seems as if nothing is ""worth it"" to me as I'd rather just smoke and work. Please let me know anything that has helped you get rid of the constant reminder to smoke and allowed you to actually pursue your goals with clarity to the fullest extent.

I find if i can make it to about 7 or 8pm at night the cravings go away and I'm relieved i didn't crack. 

I don't think i can really go back to that lifestyle of an addict anymore to be honest, i think I'll just have to deal with the cravings and thoughts some how.

I was a recreational smoker for 10+ years and it became a daily habit about a year ago (every day after work and all day on weekends). One day, I looked at myself in the mirror and saw someone that I didn't like.  I decided I wanted to better myself for me and my wife (love of my entire life). 

I haven't touched weed in 51 days. This is huge for me.  That said, it was not an easy journey.  The first couple weeks were riddled with panic attacks and crushing anxiety.  Throw in night sweats and insomnia (pick the day) and no appetite and I was a full mess, I literally thought I would never be mentally stable again.  Weeks 3-4 things eased up a lot and I thought I made it through the woods.... Week 5 hit and my I got smacked with a wave of mild (still sucky but mild compared to week 1-2) anxiety and some depression.  Week 6 things got easier again and by week 7 I felt back to myself.... Then week 8 hit and I feel the mild anxiety and depression again.  

I know that this road to recovery will have it's ups and downs and it sure sounds like I'm experiencing some PAWs symptoms.  I've messaged a few of you out there that have been through this and I'm constantly reassured that this is normal and will eventually pass.  For those currently struggling with their early symptoms or who are experiencing PAWs, I feel you and you're not alone.

I’ve been smoking all day everyday for a couple months at this point. I almost don’t know if I’m high anymore but I still do it. My fiancé smoked for years before he joined the military, but he just quit like it was nothing and moved on. He doesn’t get why it’s so hard for me. I plan to move across the country in 2 months to be with my him. I will have to stop smoking weed by then. I was supposed to move 4 months ago but freaked out and canceled (which I feel pathetic and horribly guilty over) I don’t have any friends either so no one to talk to. Doesn’t help I currently live in a place where weed is very popular.

I’ve been thinking about quitting for a while but haven’t felt the motivation yet. But The last few weeks have been miserable. I haven’t been able to sleep through the night since early November. I wake up sometime between 1-4am and usually struggle for hours to quiet my anxious mind to fall back asleep. I end up pacing around my house at 2am like a crazy person. All I want to do is smoke and go back to bed, but a lot of the time that doesn’t even work.  

I woke up at 1am today, and forced my self to not smoke. I fell back asleep but woke up again at 2, 3, 4, 5 and been up ever since. Now I’m sitting on my bathroom floor reading through this subreddit for the first time trying to distract my self and find some motivation.

Life ain’t perfect but regaining a little bit of control has made a world of difference.,"I’m approaching the end of my 20s and thinking back on how the decade has unfolded. Lots of personal progress but also major questions in my mind on if I really fulfilled my potential. When I finished college I decided that I wanted to take things super easy—get a day job,  smoke weed, exist outside the paradigm of school which kind of just moves you along from class to class until finally you’re done. 

The day job was supposed to be a means to an end while I pursued other goals. Those endeavors weren’t nurtured with much consistency. Today, I’m still working that day job 6 years later and while I’m working in a respectable occupation that has good benefits (ie insurance that pays for my therapist), and could be long term if I play my cards right,  it was never what i expected to do for the rest of my life.

Don’t get me wrong, lots of good has happened this decade. Plenty of memorable experiences and good times. I’ve adopted some rewarding hobbies and past times, I met my partner five years ago and we have a lovely home together. Together we’ve shared some great times, albeit smoking weed was once an activity we did together. But overall I’m much more comfortable in my own skin now than I was a decade ago and he is a big reason why.

I’m getting reacquainted with my passions now that I’m not distracted by weed all the time. Noticing the difference over the last six months has been a little bittersweet. Time passes in such a different manner, and there’s a temptation to reclassify my stoner years as sleepwalking through life. I don’t think I ever idled that much, but I can’t help but wonder where I’d be or what I’d be doing if I had a bit more focus and didn’t turn to a magic remedy to cure my boredom?

Now, the restlessness is real and I actually feel empowered to try something new, to challenge myself. I’m also at a crossroads in my life because I think it’s time to make a giant leap out of my comfort zone. That fills me with some anxiety—it’s not just me anymore. I have a little family with my partner and our children... ok, actually they’re pets ;). 

Anyway, for all the uncertainty going on in my mind, it’s a gift to not have to question my thoughts and emotions as being overly clouded by pothead judgment. If you’re struggling or wondering if you should quit, I offer that as a definite benefit I have seen.

Be well, everyone!",16

I have been smoking every day for the last 3 years, I’d say about .5 a day but definitely still have a good dependency to it.

Tonight is officially the third day without it. I have been taking melatonin pills and one hydrozyzine to sleep, along with deep breathing techniques while in bed. I have had moderate anxiety and moreso random phases throughout the day. I live with my boyfriend so I am doing everything in my power to not have terrible mood swings but at times it is really difficult. The reason I stopped smoking is because I have a vacation planned in about a month and I can’t bring any weed and I want to enjoy my vacation and not worry about horrible sleep and mood swings.. I plan to smoke after the vacation so I still have my bong and weed (about 8g left), and my dab cart. I’m pretty proud of myself for being able to keep it in my room and restrain myself from smoking any. I’m nervous things will get worse over the initial two weeks but I’m doing my best to stick with this as I know it’ll be much worse vacationing during horrible withdrawal.. wish me luck!

My two strongest cravings/habits (AKA my biggest weak points) are:

1) Cannabis as morning coffee. I feel like cannabis makes me more creative and habitually enjoy a smoke sesh in the morning to get my creative juices flowing. 

2) Cannabis as evening cocktail. After dinner it’s such a strong habit to turn to cannabis to make the rest of the night not boring or to not deal with anything too heavy. 

These patterns have been ingrained into my life and muscle memory for 20 years. 

It seems simple to change but it’s so hard. 

I need to replace these habits and cues with new rituals!!

If you have similar cannabis habits tied to day/night and were able to replace with other habits/rituals, would love to hear about it.

2019-11-19 20:51:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dyus6b/45_daysrant/,45 Days/Rant,"INPUT APPRECIATED

First off, I don’t post on reddit a lot. I lurk, that’s about it. I don’t rant a lot either. But even though I have a great girlfriend and people around me, I need to rant. 

I’m 45 days in. I smoked for probably over 2 years, about daily. Started at some point when I was 16, and I quit a month or so after my 19th birthday. I was always a  “smart” kid in school, and still managed to get pretty good ACT and AP scores despite smoking every night.  I had a fairly traumatic event occur when I was younger involving the death of my father, and I think those feelings that I never processed began to manifest which is why I started smoking so much. It didn’t help that I was always introverted and didn’t have the greatest relationship with my mom. I’ve also always been extremely neurotic, and just over think everything. 

Anyways. I’m posting because things are getting really rough and it has to be because of weed. When I used to smoke, I would sometimes go through periods of derealization and sometimes depersonalization. For me, it was the basic feeling of reality not being really. I would think about existential things like death and purpose. It would always go away after a short while. 

Well, now I’ve been sober for 45 days. About a week and a half ago, so ~35 days in, I decided to begin taking my Anti depressants again. I was prescribed previously for depression but stopped taking them. Well, about 5 days in I was having extreme anxiety, derealization, and was on the verge of psychosis/Mania. I’m in college, but I went home in the middle of the week. I met with my psychologist and my doctor, and they agreed it could have been caused by the SSRIs, as sometimes they make things worse. They decided to treat my ADHD as it could be making my depression and anxiety worse. So I haven’t taken those anti depressants in 4-5 days now and I’m on day 1 of ADHD meds, but I still just feel fucking out of it. 

I guess I just wanted to maybe hear some similar experiences? I think there’s a lot of factors here. THC withdrawal, other meds, and just unsolid ground in general (the shock of moving to college and living on my own). But this didn’t start until 35 days in. 

Any responses appreciated :) thank you if you read this whole thing. I’ve never ranted like this before.",4

- sober outlook on life: not every stupid stoner thought is an epiphany on my life. When I look back at some of the ideas I had while high I often cringe. They seemed to make so much sense back then...

- socializing: I can fucking talk to people! And anytime of the day, not just in that sweet spot where I'm not too high but not feeling the crash. People text me and I text back right away, not pushing it off and eventually forgetting. People call me and I pick up, not ignore it because I'm paranoid I'll sound high or act wierd because I just smoked.

- feel great in the mornings. No lethargic brain foggy stone over 

- go to bed on time, not staying up until 2am watching prank videos on YouTube.

- eating healthy. I have the self control to stay away from the junk food and have the motivation to actually cook real food.

Edit: Chipotle is still just as good sober! 😊

I’ve done pretty well with anxiety thus far but today is by far a bad one. 

I’ve been out from work for surgery but my anxiety about returning is so bad. I’m not even supposed to go back for a month. 

My aunt is having a 8 hour corrective surgery to fix a hole in her esophagus and a cervical disc correction tomorrow. I’m just so worried about her. This isn’t a little surgery by any means. 

My power is scheduled to be out again tomorrow for the 5th time in about a month. You can google PG&E California power outages and you will see why in case you are not in this area. 

Next Monday is the 26th anniversary of my dads death and I just found a bunch of old pictures of him and I when I was a baby. It’s just giving me all sorts of feelings. 

I’m sitting in a parking lot trying to order Chipotle and the app is not working and I’m so frustrated.

I know it’s a combination of situational things and the lack of marijuana but all of these minor things feels like a mountain on top of me. 

I’m going to go home and eat my chipotle I finally got ordered, take a few deep breaths, and just let the feelings be. I still wanted to put this out there to get it off my chest. Normally I’d smoke at a time like this but not today! Definitely counterproductive.",2

About 8 months ago I moved across the country for a job opportunity and for the past 6 months or so I've been smoking daily. I smoke small pipe bowls so my overall consumption isn't very high, and it doesn't interfere with my work or social life however when I'm home alone I'm smoking. And when I smoke (alone) I lose all motivation and self-control. I just play videogames and eat junk and it's been getting real depressing.

Part of my reason for moving up here was to record some of my music and I have the songs written but I just never get around to recording it. Every time I have free time I just gravitate to wasting time and it pisses me off that I've thrown away half a year. It's still great to smoke a joint with friends an have a jam but I need to learn to schedule and exercise self-control. Do you guys think that's possible or will cutting it out totally be my only real option?

Not sure where else to turn right now but reading this sub has been helping me feel a little more normal. Thanks in advance guys",7

Since I quit I've been better about exercising, being more social and all that jazz. But I can't just sit back and relax and watch something as simple as my news videos that I've watched daily since I was in 7th grade. Since quitting I've been busy with finding a job to replace my current one, writing more, and also my new girlfriend that I'm healthily obsessed with. But job is falling into place, I'm still writing, and girlfriend is now gone for two weeks visiting family.. And my downtime is EXCRUCIATING. I can't watch a single video, documentary, stand up special, even READ without checking my phone constantly, getting into thought loops and switching over to video games for 10 minutes before losing interest in that and going back to what I was doing before and starting the whole process over again. 

This never happened when I smoked. I was able to just put something on and get completely lost in whatever I was doing. Whether it be a video essay, movie, book, or video game. I genuinely miss that and hope it's not gone with the the weed.. I'm noticing it a lot  more  now that I have so much more down time.",6
2019-11-19 16:30:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dyr5tx/the_vicious_cycle/,The Vicious Cycle,"Anyone else quit for 3-5 days at a time, cave in, and then just get so uncomfortably high off the tiniest bit and have anxiety attacks?

You freak out a little and immediately regret smoking, reminding yourself why you want to quit and realizing that you can't even function when you smoke with this little tolerance.

You literally just have to lay down and ride out the first 45 min or so of the high. And try to breathe lol.

And then when you get over the attack it gets kind of pleasant. Actually, quite pleasant. And then maybe you smoke just a liiittle bit more - obviously less than that last rip. Just to keep this pleasant feeling you know?

And it isn't nearly as bad this time. The anxiety doesn't set in; your body has amazingly already built some tolerance even after just that first hit.

You know if you continue to smoke it will get more enjoyable and less uncomfortable as your tolerance builds, but you don't want to continue.

So you stop again for another 3-5 days, but then something starts to call you back. Maybe it's that enjoyable memory you had of your experience after the initial anxiety subsided. Or it was just a really long day and you'd love to disconnect for a bit. Or feeling any other emotional pain you may be going through that you know is just a toke away from relief.

And thus, the cycle repeats itself.

This is hard.",3
2019-11-19 15:43:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dyqge6/on_my_last_cartridge_need_to_stop_but_so_scared/,"On my last cartridge, need to stop but so scared","I've been smoking pretty regularly for about 12 years, since entering my freshman year of college. It was only not daily for the first year. Smoking weed was so fun back then, but now it's just a mental and emotional burden that I can't seem to shake. I realized that even before numbing myself with weed, I already had a number of unhealthy coping mechanisms in adolescent years to escape an unpredictable home environment, and escape thoughts of disappointing my very conservative, very religious parents (habits like binge watching TV, addicted to social media, etc). 

So now I know that I have to work through some trauma and that I won't be able to do this fully without letting go of my biggest crutch. I quit once when dating someone who didn't smoke, for about 9 months. He broke up with me, and I made it a few months before starting up again to cope with my sadness. That was January of this year. While I'm an active person with many extracurriculars, I struggle so hard with this addiction. I think I am afraid to remove the blanket that takes the edge off my emotions. Even while dating someone and sober, a lot of emotions and unresolved trauma came to the surface, particularly in our interactions. It was the first time I was experiences such concentrated emotion and pain. Now I'm back to smoking again, and I know part of it is because I quit for him, not for me. The smoking is worse than ever before, especially with having access to weed pens. I smoke in the morning, I smoke at work, even in the bathroom of the office building. I want to get high so much I don't care that it could lose me my job by smoking in the work parking lot. It affects how I function at work, how quickly I get things done at home, and causes a lot of shame and regret and anxiety. I'm a singer and the vapes/flower are hurting my throat. The vape has me hacking and coughing, but I'm still smoking it.

Today I smoked at work, and was instantly overcome with shame and deep sadness and anxiety. So much that I almost cried at my desk feeling so bad. I feel trapped. Reading these posts helped, and I am considering throwing away my vape pen today. However, I feel like some of what the weed did was help even me out with other meds I am on. It started with antidepressants in January because of severe depression. The meds made me very sleepy and air brained during the day, so I started taking adderall again (which I had also stopped taking while dating this person) to help me focus. Then I smoked to help me calm down at night, and also to cope with my emotions about the breakup. 

I guess the overall goal is to taper weed, then taper adderall, and taper off the antidepressant too as I never wanted to stay on it permanently. I haven't known what I am at baseline (which I consider to be single, sober, and off meds) in so, so long. The anxiety of what that might even be like makes me want to smoke. I'm working with a therapist who is great but does not specialize in addiction.

Sorry this is so long. I guess I am looking for some encouragement and advice if anyone has it about the relationship between weed/adderall, and if both have to be stopped together. I hope I have the courage to get rid of this pen tonight and not pick it up again. Thanks to everyone who comments on this page, it honestly has been really helpful to read, especially the ones that say we're not missing much by quitting. <3",2

Heh, thought I'd change it up a little and have a different introduction 😆

So, triggers, triggers everywhere today, i won't lie. 

To be honest, if i didn't know myself so well and had not been through ten years worth of relapsing and two decades plus of addiction and trying to moderate etc, i could have justified at least having a few beers tonight. 

And maybe i could of had a few and not bought weed or got too drunk. 

But i can guarantee with 100% certainty, it would eventually lead me back to smoking weed from morning until night, day after day again. 

I know that path and i decided to avoid it all together and stay on the abstinence route ☺

It's really the only option for me... complete and utter abstinence from all drugs and alcohol. 

I'll bid all my friends on here a good evening, 

All the very best.

Im turning 18 in a couple of days and have been smoking weed for around 7 years now, of wich 3 years where daily smoking. i am starting to feel like drugs will be part of my life and i despise it. growing up i was around drugs all the time and it that ""world"" of drugs seemed to just be how things go you know. when i was 11 me and my best friend decided to go and sneak out of the house at 3 A.M. to smoke weed with some older kids we knew, and man that was so much fun. but over the years it slowly started becoming less and less fun and started feeling more like it was just a part of who i was and like i had to smoke everyday just to be myself.

now that im 17, almost turning 18 almost none of the fun of smoking is left. i dont get high and giggle about fun stuff and doing fun stuff anymore. i get baked as hell to the point where i am just a useless person and the only thing i can do is roll up another joint. and eventhough i know this for a fact my head still tells me i need drugs just to have fun and function.

i know leaves is for quitting weed but i feel like the hard drugs play a big role in how i feel aswell. i dont feel addicted to the harder drugs and dont feel a constant urge to use like i get with weed but im rolling off mandy almost every weekend and pretty much snort or swallow anything somebody places in front of me. the friends i have now are really the sweetest and nobody has bad intentions. they just do a lot of drugs aswell and i really just cant leave them behind i dont know what i would do without them.

i dont talk to my friends or parents about any of this, however my parents have sent me to a rehab clinic around 8 months ago and so far nothing in my life has changed. if anything i only started doing more and more drugs in that time.

in the past i posted on here only talking about the weed but im so affraid of becoming addicted to harder drugs and/or overdosing. im even hesitant about telling this wonderfull and supportive community about my other drug use, thats how ashamed of what my life has become. im horribly depressed and constantly get short suicidal urges everytime im at a train station or busy road because im just constantly thinking of how badly i want to change this fucking life, yet for some reason i dont want to change badly enough otherwise i already would have. it makes me feel weak, subhuman, unworthy and i might be overreacting but man fuck. i dont really know where im going with this.

i am not in controll of my own fucking life anymore it makes me sick

Also, this experience has shown my addictive personality, making me fearful for my future. Quitting cold turkey has been quite difficult for me, as I find myself smoking just so I can have a good meal and be energized for sports and other activities. I don’t even feel like I crave the high anymore but smoke to satisfy my hunger. Would it be beneficial to cut down gradually? For example if I set a goal to quit completely by December 15th and gradually reduced until then would it help cope with the loss of appetite? I know everyone is different but any insight helps!

I get caffeine headaches though and it's been hard to drink enough water to combat them due to having hectic days at work. Work stress is also probably not helping me during this time.

Since quitting, I have really good sleep hygiene, eat healthy, exercise, and have decided to cut caffeine out of my diet in hopes to sleep better. Any other tips? 

I’m trying to take a positive spin on this—if I didn’t have this crazy insomnia, idk if I would have the motivation to stay sober. Definitely not putting myself through this shit again—it’s pure hell.

So, I have about a month or so before my next semester and figured if I am going to smoke, it should be now while I am out of school (also they random test at my school because we are in the hospital). 

Today, I smoked and it was blah. I zoned out, my conversations were dull. I felt genuinely apathetic about most things that crossed my mind. I noticed my heart rate increased and I actually felt less relaxed. I didn't really enjoy eating (which I expected to be enjoyable). I felt a bit dizzy and frustrated that I chose to smoke. However, this has been a lesson for me in my journey. Weed still sucks the life out of me. It is not cool or fun -- it drains me of my personality. I'm better off without it in my life.

Problems in my business and in my marriage are in some ways created by big decisions made by other people, and I just went along, not necessarily knowing how deeply they would impact my financial and emotional health. My first instinct upon this realization is to smoke - proof that I can have something for ME, and no one else. I say yes, I agree to everything, and I figure I'll get stoned and carve out that time for myself, instead of discovering what my real needs, desires and boundaries are. This is likely why I'm in these situations in the first place. 

I keep using weed as a panacea for these problems, but they are problems that deserve real, thoughtful solutions, and weed is a blunt instrument (so to speak ;) ) 

 As difficult as it is to resist, I'm starting to see the real, authentic wisdom in sobriety. Maybe that is my god of my understanding, that god lives in me, on the other side of the meltdown,  the tension that exists between despair and hope is where this kernel of spiritual, emotional truth lives, and what I've been searching for all along. 

It was a long and painful day. I sometimes hate who I am, my overeating and procrastinating ways. But today I stayed sober so I can get clear. I stayed sober so I can solve my financial problems with a clear head. I stayed sober so I can be a good long distance wife. I stayed sober so I can be a good mentor, and hopefully some day parent. And I stayed sober so that I can continue this journey of self-discovery that we are all so courageously taking.",3

Finding my confidence was definitely in the top 3 reasons why I quit. One thing I regret so far on this journey is not quitting other substances like alcohol. I feel like I’d definitely be in a better place if I quit that too. I feel like a lot of people on here are quitting for self improvement and personal growth. I can’t see myself growing much if I’m still clinging on to instant gratification and other things that give me pleasure that are artificial. This includes sexual pleasure as well. That’s just me tho. So I’m proud of 56 days. But I could’ve been more proud had I given up everything else..had I given up chasing feelings. This past weekend was my last time drinking alcohol and I haven’t drank caffeine in two weeks. I feel great but like I said, I could be feeling way better. I’m being patient though. Love y’all.",6

I'm 27F and was smoking weed on a regular basis since around June 2018. I quit cold turkey 11 days ago due to worsening anxiety, and thankfully I'm not craving it too much. The first couple of days were OK. 

I am, however, experiencing some uncomfortable side effects, with the worst two being overwhelming anxiety (especially in the morning - I can't pinpoint what I'm stressed about and also can't calm myself) and insomnia.

Ive been keeping a log of my sleep, exercise, anxiety levels, and my diet has been great. It is currently 1am here in the UK and this has been the worst night so far, and I am sweating buckets. I've been looking through this forum every day and many of the posts have been really hopeful and inspiring. I've also been reading about PAWS and stressing out at the thought of this going on for a year or so. I can't imagine being able to cope with the shattered nerves and lack of sleep for that long. 

My partner also quit at the same time and we are supporting one another, although he seems to be having a pretty OK time. 

I just wondered if anyone could tell me if this is normal? This seems to be getting worse and I'm really afraid. Would love to hear about your experiences. 

Thanks in advance.",3

[Long Post, clinical at times)

tl:dr - I'm going through classic withdrawal, Doc says give at least one whole month for symptoms to go away.

Background Info:
42-old average white male, 182 lbs. Started smoking weed regularly in early twenties, became a heavy vape user in my 30s. Hit 40: Got married (2017) and became a father (2018), and getting ready to welcome baby #2 Nov. 2019. 

My daily use would be, a couple puffs in the morning, a couple of puffs in the afternoon, and a couple of puffs at night. I would say 16-24 vape puffs in a 24-hour cycle. I don’t smoke cigarettes, nor ingest any other narcotics/medication, and I don’t drink alcohol. Just non-flavored, California non-profit dispensary bought.  

I have stopped smoking flower before, for a year and half, for a job. As soon as I got comfortable working with the team, built relationships, and the day-to-day grind became secondhand, I resumed vaping.

My wife (34f), whom has never ingested an illicit substance, has been awesome to say the least, totally supports my decision to use or not to use. Albeit, she does prefer that I don’t. We have a great marriage, no real stressors; we both took care of money. We pre-plan finances a month, a quarter, a year as best we can, so we are in-tune with each other money wise. Full disclosure: we did ledger my weed habit into our monthly costs budget. 

My reasons for quitting for good:

1.	My wife is currently on FMLA (leave) for the pregnancy, and come Q2 2020 I’ll be a SAHD for two under two. 

2.	Health risks, the jury is still out on long term health effects and want to live a quality life as long as possible for my family.

3.	 I started to experience anxiety after puffing. With the birth of my first child and being the middle generation in my extended family brings up thoughts on my own mortality, which contributes to the anxiety. 

4.	More money in our pocket ($50 a week adds up) is a good thing.

Ok here we go…

11/5 - DAY 0: 

It is 3:30am and I cannot sleep. Mama and baby (16 mos.) sleeping peacefully in the bed next to me. Go outside with vape, puff. Shortly after, started having acute anxiety and heart started racing. Started worrying about the future, my mortality, “When I die will I see my family again? I’ll miss them terribly.” “I don’t want to die anytime soon, I’m just getting started!” Kind of thoughts. Nothing good. Look at vape, reflect on the time and money spent, and reflect on unknown impacts on future. Really starting to get anxious. Looking at the vape pen, “Dude, maybe it’s time you and I split.” 

630am - Baby wakes up and I’m on baby duty (brush, shower, clothes, feeding,). Handled. Wanted to puff, but did not. Started to get nausea in stomach. Chest feels heavy or at least I’m more aware and alert to beats and pressure in chest. Take pulse, ~80bpm resting, not bad, but could be better.

700am – Wife comes downstairs and I tell her of my plan to quit for good. Gather medical info (Mayo, Johns Hopkins, WebMD) that I can on withdrawal symptoms and communicate this to wife. She acknowledges the symptoms and we go on with our day. I skip breakfast; I do not feel like eating at all. Drinking water is not effortless, but I get some water down.

Lunchtime – it’s getting really bad now, anxiety and nausea are kicking my ass. I recall we have one bottle of Ensure (it’s a nutritional supplement drink) in the refrigerator. Down the bottle of Ensure. Nausea fades; start to feel a bit better. Anxiety is still there.

Afternoon  - walked with family. Keep talking with wife about symptoms. She replies, “I’ll be with you every step of the way.”

Dinner time – a small bowl of pasta, I have two bites, can’t finish it. Wife understands. Try to down water. Same levels of anxiety.

9pm bedtime– I have mild sweating, and I woke up to baby crying in nursery, wait for baby to go back down, and back to sleep. 

11pm – Wife brings baby to bed, we all go down for the night, Mild sweating, nothing big. But the anxiety/chest feelings are still there.


Day 1:
445am – Wake up, anxiety is noticeably milder, and the chest isn’t thumping, browse the net for an hour. Start gaming; get some entertainment in.

630am - Baby wakes up and I’m on baby duty (brush, shower, clothes, feeding,). Handled. Little man is playing and I down another bottle of Ensure. Nausea is gone. But a mild feeling of anxiety is still there.
As the day went on, I feel mostly the same, but a very small portion of my appetite comes back.

Lunchtime – I finish my small bowl of leftover pasta, feels like an accomplishment. 

3pm – Anxiety is still there. Got the sweats a little bit, time to get outside…

6pm Dinnertime – Eat a small chicken taco, and plenty of fruit. Fruit now has become an easy thing to ingest. Plan to intake lots of fruit each day.

715pm – Call my parents and let them know I am detoxifying. I have a “moment” in the conversation, where I break down crying and it comes out, “I’m so sorry for wasting all that time, I’m so sorry for wasting all that money. I’m so sorry I took so long to get my shit together.” Tears stop; breathe. Dad randomly asks if I have time to come down and fix (setup) the new TV, I bust up laughing, feels good man.

11pm – Bedtime – Still get night sweats, Wear mouth guard due to grinding teeth more than usual. (per wife)


Day 2:
515am – Wake up, cold shirt, night sweats got me. Anxiety much much lower. Routine triggers to puff are less explicit. Urine continues to be orange, so I plan to drink more water. Zero Nausea.

2pm – Had lunch and fruit.

3pm – Anxiety came back, Palms sweating, BPM 86 sitting, need to get that lower.


Day 3:
It’s getting a little better, but the night sweats and anxiety are still there.


Day 4-9:
It’s getting better – I’m eating more, sleep has not changed, little bouts of anxiety come and go…


Day 10:
Holy hell, the anxiety came in with a vengeance! Started in the morning. Sweaty palms constantly. Went to wife OB/GYN appointment and asked if they could take my vitals, they do, normal. Still feeling anxious. Went to Chiropractor after lunch, asked for vitals from neighboring MD, he was happy to take them, said, “Things are fine.” Blood pressure and pulse taken three times, all normal.

Cut to dinnertime – and I’m really feeling pressure over heart and in left arm  - ok, no more fucking around – walk across the street to Urgent Care and ask if they can check if I’m having an M.I. – they don’t take any information down, “Come to the back now, we’re going to hook you up to the EKG.” 

They get two sets of readings – all normal – on duty NP does not want to take any chances – they want to take me to the ER by ambulance.

I refuse ambulance – I can drive myself, it’s close – sign waiver.

5-10 mins. later I’m at the ER. 2nd in line for Triage – it’s slow for a Friday night, around 730pm.

Got a bed, vitals and blood work (cardiac enzyeme) are taken. Doc asks for history, I tell her everything, full honesty. 

After listening, she requests full chest x-rays, she wants to see if there’s any build-up or growths. X-rays all come clear and normal. She remarks, “Ok, this is classic cannabis withdrawal, and with the THC potency in lab vapes being around 90% compared to flower, the THC toxicity in your system is so much more…you’ll need some time to fully adjust…you need to relax over the weekend, but rest assured this is not an M.I. Your heart is fine.”

By the end of the ER visit, I felt so much better. Apologize my heart out for wasting their time. They are all sweethearts, saying along the lines of, “We see this all the time, this why we are here, and you’re doing the right thing Dad.” 

Grab small dinner, go home, eat, call parents, hold wife as we drift to sleep.


Day 11:
A good day, no complaints.


Day 12:
Another good day


(today) Day 13:
Mild anxiety in the morning, but gone in afternoon. 
Had my first Primary Care Physician visit in over 15 years today. Took my weight: 175 lbs. (lost 7 lbs?!) Doc is with the same hospital as ER, got all my test results on laptop. Tell doc everything – after full body check up, doc says I need to exercise - 2 hours of cardio every week, spilt it up 4 days, 30 minutes each day. Couch to 5k app here I come. Cholesterol check is happing tomorrow. If results are normal then I will need once a year visits. Beyond that, I’m in great health. 

Doc says give at least one whole month for symptoms to go away.

Note: I’m unsure about proper posting/update rules – should just keep editing initial post with Day 14+ entries, or just reply to initial post?

I've met you when I was 17, a post-teenage guy full of goals and dreams but kinda disoriented.

The first time I've met you, I couldn't believe how happy and euphoric I was, laughing out loud with my brother and friends. That day you showed me a whole new world MJ. I loved the way you made me feel, but those days I didn't use to smoke you daily. 

I started to get in deeper with you I guess about 6 months after I've met you, going to friends' house in my born city, where we were free to smoke a lot without any of our parents bothering us. Those were rememorable days! I have deep feelings from the friends I've made, me and my brother studied also with them since we were children so basically everyone of our friends' group started smoking together and also all of us used to drinking alcohol too. 

In my 19s, in 2012, I moved to a bigger city to start studying at college. This moving was my freedom and my chaos. After a year being focused in my studies and not smoking you I was able to not have a fog in my brain and could concentrate pretty well. But about a year since I've moved, I started to smoke you daily. Always you, MJ and Nicky (those names are my friendly names to weed and cigarretes). Those days I couldn't realize how slowlly and delightfully you were fucking with my life. I started losing my focus and concentration, all my emotions were becoming numb. I started becaming lazy with my studies and house cleaning, I was basically replacing all my daily routine activities with smoking weed. Instead of going to classes, all I did daily was meeting with new stoners friends I've made here all day and night and not doing much than that. That were my ""endless happinness"" bubble for those last 7 years.

In 2014, I did an internship in Budapest, that was a fantastic experience. But as a fucked up stoner I am, I'd didn't used to go to college's classes there, and my grades were really really bad, all I was doing were not giving a shit about the disciplines and college, all I did also was daily smoking even more powerful weed strains that I couldn't smoke in Brazil. In that year I've met other drugs too like ecstasy, lsd and magic mushrooms, salvia, mdma and cocaine. I couldn't see better life than being really fucking stoned all day and forget about all real life shit and live in that parallel world. 

When I moved back to Brazil, I got depressed, gave up my studies and I was jobless. The money my parents used to give me I would spend most on weed. After getting better from this depression episode, I starded studying again a new degree. But again in my life, I started not going to classes and passing all the day smoking weed with friends in the day, and drinking and taking n-bomes( shitty fake lsd) and snorting cocaine, every nigh a party at the pub.

Now I'm 26, I could still get a job thankfully, still trying to finnish a college degree, unfortunately not the new one I started again in 2016 because I had fucked up grades and had to work and the studies were during the day and also the job I've got. I'm still on a hard battle with weed and cigarretes. I've just spent my rent money with weed and even the money of the groceries, I'm pretty fucked addicted. I'm getting help of a therapist that is helping me a lot and also taking some escitalopram pills by the psychiatris. I feel getting stronger to battle against those addictions. I'm glad I don't drink, cocaine or any drug anymore for around 6 months just MJ and Nicky. After all the shit I passed beco use of you both, I feel now calm and peaceful to break up with you both right now.

Thanks for reading or not.
Wish me luck on this road.

Cheers ;)",3

As a teetotaler, my ""vice"" was trees, and has been on and off or over a decade. I'm 30 now, and I remember about 5 years ago when I came to this sub. I asked then if I had a problem or not, described my habits, and realized on my own at the end of my post that I should quit. I said I would (hint: i didn't), but I remember someone on here told me they were older, and they said something along the lines of ""do it now, you don't want to grow old and watch all your years disappear into a haze..."" well I didn't listen to him, and 5 years went by. And he was right. I've had a haze. I haven't focused on my work, I've let it even ruin relationships, I could smoke all day everyday or the rest of my life lol. I love it! I love so many things about it, but I have to be real with myself now.

I just got out of a divorce (or currentily in it technically I guess) and moved back home with my mother. It sucks, but, it's okay. She's great, and she allows me to smoke. She had to manage it for me though, because I knew myself that I had a problem with it. I was spending WAY too much money on trees. Forget lack of ambition, or that I don't care about exercising while high, more than anything, it's all the damn money I put into it that I regret. Anyways, I can't pay my bills, I owe my mom and dad money, I've got a ton of things to pay of like debts, I've got dates coming up that I can't pay or because I smoked all my money. So I'm done. I know trees aren't evil, and I'm grateful or all the things that trees has shown me and revealed to me about myself. Truely, I think that trees is a substance (most) people should try at least once, if even to see what it reveals to them. However, I abuse the crap out of it. The fact that it barely has any (hardcore) negative side effects is what makes it so dangerous or me personally, because I can keep smoking all day every day.

Anyways, I've tried to have people manage it for me. My mother thinks it's okay or me to smoke only on weekends, and is willing to hold my trees for me. We tried that for about two weeks, but I realized... what the fuck am I gonna do when I move out on my own again? Even with my ex-wife, I could not control my trees habit. Someone is not going to be there for me for the rest of my life to manage my trees or me, spacing it out over weekends or once a day or w/e. I have to do this for myself.

I just went downstairs and smashed my pipe. A bunch of resin came out, and I realized, holy crap, I can get LIT off just all this resin. I stood there for a few minutes, contemplating how I could smoke the resin ball that I was forming in my mind, without a pipe. Then I realized, fuck this. I am sick and tired of a plant owning me. I smelled the resin. It smelled disgusting. I know a lot of that is in my lungs too, as I quit trees just 4 days ago and am coughing up black stuff (I also quit ciggs too though, so IDK what is attributing to the black stuff). I also threw away my golden shiny lucky grinder, something I've treasured for a long time.

Anyways, wish me luck guys. I'm ready to be sober!",3

March will be exactly 1 year sober for me. I just need to stop fantasizing about those few moments after the first hit.

* I am at about 4 months now
* I am not having the urge to smoke again. In fact,. I can't imagine it, I'd feel guilty before I started and would have to start this whole mess over again.

The bad news is:

* I'm feeling pretty down, pretty depressed, and the brain fog is just epic. 

Now, there are two things at play here: I quit weed after 30 years (yes ,30 years) 4 months ago but I also quit taking wellbutrin after 7 years about 2 months ago. So, my brain is in a tizzy! 

My gut feeling is that the 30 years of weed is taking me more time to recover from than the wellbutrin. The wellbutrin was mostly for rumination and that hasn't really returned,  and isn't an SSRI, but for sure its not making things easier!

I guess, I'm looking for a little encouragement or experiences from anyone who had a rough go at the 4 to 5 month mark. In other words, if someone could remind me that this is just a phase, that would be great :)",3

I've had some slightly higher cravings than usual though today. I think they were triggered by the fact i had a bit of stress at work due to the van not working first thing this morning, i got that sorted quickly by buying a new battery though. 

I think this time of year triggered cravings also. As i was driving along the English countryside looking at the autumn colours. I started to think how it would be nice to have a few beers and a few joints. 

The cravings weren't ""red alert"" intensity, but still felt like i was entering the danger zone. 

I was able to let it pass eventually. Because i know all too well how it would play out. And I'd be back at square one thinking about quitting again within a few months. 

So, anyway, i hope everyone is keeping well.

I want to be impulsive so I don't get too much time to think about it. I don't know what to do. I feel like if I do it then I can just stop again after, right? I don't know. I can't believe I'm still battling this bullshit. I wish I didn't know how it great it felt to be high so I wouldn't be craving it.... Any comments will be helpful. Even though I feel like I am convinced I HAVE TO and NEED to TO.  Ugh feel so annoyed of myself",2

But it’s been around 8 months. All day everyday smoker with about a 250€/month habbit for a period of 12 years. Crazy, if you think about it. I wanted to quit the last 3 years. But you can’t just quit a habit like that cold turkey, let’s be honest here. 

So for all you that want to quit, you will fail, you will go 3 days sober, relapse. Another day sober, relapse. That’s basically the proces. You don’t even know the real you anymore. You’ll get a burst of emotions, you’ll feel overwhelmed. You’ll relapse. But if you truly want to quit. It will happen. 

The first two weeks are the hardest. It’s pretty easy after that.

Good luck friends. I know you truly want it else you wouldn’t be here.",42

Even crazier to think that a few months ago, I was high as fuck all day every day. I can’t tell you all that I feel 100% because even tho I’m clean from weed, I’m still battling other demons. These other demons popped up because they saw I was vulnerable without my precious weed. So these past 56 days haven’t been too challenging because I’ve been indulging in other bad habits. Even though I’m no longer consumed by this sense of impending doom that weed caused, I still find myself feeling not okay. I feel like I’m losing myself to my other bad habits. One bad habit is my drinking. I don’t drink everyday but I do drink sometimes every weekend. It sets me back on my goal. It’s almost impossible for me to drink causally and I’ve known this. Earlier this year I stopped drinking for 65 days thanks to r/stopdrinking and felt amazing. I know it’s possible. Bad habits are negatives that have sprouted since quitting. But with a bit of help from my family, I think I’m going to be alright. The positives with not smoking in almost two months have been great. I feel closer to my family but still not where I want to be. Clear headedness is what motivates me to keep going. I want to be in charge of every conversation I have. I don’t want my emotions to take ahold of me. I’m finding it easier to read and easier to meditate. This is where I kick it into overdrive. Good luck to the rest of you and thanks for following me on this journey.",6

Im trying to taper off now, only smoking at nights but im still dealing with these pains every morning and throughout the day. Its noticeably worse when im laying down or sitting. If im in motion or on my feet i can seem to bear it. 

Anyone deal with this before? Any ideas? I’ve been drinking lots of water, taking nauzene and some pepto but id doesn’t do too much. 

I really want to follow through this time to quit. I enjoy who i am sober. The physical withdrawals are much more than I anticipated but I want to see it through. 

How long will this continue? Should i see a doctor? My fiancé is a nurse and she thinks i should but if i can wait it out I’d rather do that.

I recently moved from 2 legal states to Dallas for a job I hate back in March. it has been a very difficult transition coming from Denver and Detroit where finding a source was not only legal but much easier. I know no one here so when my only resource, my crutch, is unavailable or cannot help me I am just out of luck and on my own. 

It has been 24 hours now with no response from my go to source. Since I woke up this morning I have been non stop crying for really no apparent reason. I’m sobbing as I watch tv, I’m sobbing in the bath tub, I’m sobbing petting my cats. I’m so sad. I’m so sad it’s hard to tell if this is a side effect of not smoking or if I’m just having a bad day for no reason at all. 

I have not seen a lot of people posting recently about non stop crying and depression so I am wondering if this is a common experience amongst anyone going through withdrawal symptoms so early. 

Is it because I’m out and don’t know when I’ll be able to get more? 

Is it because I’m actually sad? 

Am I really addicted? 

I don’t know. I know that right now in this moment I feel awful and it’s never happened like this, Iv gone days without smoking, but at the same tine I also knew it was my choice or at least had some on hand when I did feel like it. Have others experienced this and made a direct correlation it is indeed from marijuana withdrawal due to not knowing when or where you’ll be able to get it again? Is it it anxiety from that? Or am I going through withdrawal emotionally?",7

Just weird because symptoms are complete opposite of last time, but I have been feeling pretty depressed so maybe that’s why I’m so sleepy. Also super proud of myself for making it this far!

Daily smoker for a year and a half. I’m 21 and a senior in college. I always smoked a few times a week my first two years but went to everyday when I realized weed was the only fun thing in my life. I’ve been trying to quit and get back to the better life that everyone here is talking about. But it doesn’t exist. I realized everything in my life was fucking bullshit and I had nothing going for me. I didn’t care about anything. The shitty realizations I had made me start smoking every night just to cope. I’ve never had any real friends or relationships. I’ve accepted the fact that I am just not normal. I’m weird and I’m socially awkward. When I meet someone and realize they like me,I count down the days before they realize I’m not normal. They always do eventually. And they drift away. 

This is why i smoke everyday. Because after 21 years of no decent friendships or relationships. There isn’t much of a point. I’m gonna graduate but I don’t think I will even be using my degree. So no real friendships, relationships or a decent life direction (which I never had before. I was just going with the flow which is essentially wasting time). Weed has been helping me since. How do I quit when I see everyone else living college lives and setting up their futures while I’m wasting mine because I have nothing better to do?

How am I supposed to quit? It’s the only thing I enjoy. It’s all that’s eased the pain. I don’t want to go back to my sober life. I fucking hate it. If I quit smoking I’ll just be back to my shitty life. How the hell do i quit?",5

I recently went 9 days sober, which was my longest stretch in more than a year and a half. I’m a heavy user, smoking joints whenever I can. I have known for over a year that smoking weed all the time was not helping my anxiety, depression or PTSD. It has just felt helpful and soothing to be high. It’s like it insulated me from the pain I was experiencing and the feelings of social isolation. 

But, a part of me thinks that my daily use could actually be contributing to those symptoms, as I’ve read here could be the case. When I try to quit, I experience a lot of emotional pain. It’s unbearable. It’s like weed is insulation from the pain and without it, there is nothing between it and me. It’s scary to think about. 

Anyway, I’ve tried to quit by going cold turkey multiple times and am met by this horrible emotional pain. When I experience it, I smoke. I’ve also tried weaning myself off several times but I always double cross myself and convince myself why it’s no big deal and I smoke whatever I have. 

I’m spending so much money on weed and I’m damaging my physical health. I’ve gained weight from overeating while high and I want to move forward with my life, without weed keeping me. How should I approach quitting? I don’t trust myself to be able to do it. I really want to. I just feel normal while I’m high. I want to feel normal and HAPPY or at least content while sober. Any advice would be appreciated! 

P.S. I’ve been regularly seeing a therapist for a year. I am seeking her advice on coping with my emotional experiences and with quitting weed. I’m just looking for extra support",9

I told myself that when i found a job, that my shitty head would get better. I was over a year unemployed then, and got myself a job two weeks after stoping. It was good to have something to keep my head focused on instead of weed. Untill work got bad. A lot of worker's regulations are simply ignored. Spent a whole month working without a single day off. Things got so stressful that i though to myself: ""Maybe i can get a joint and just chill.""

Shit. Things went down real quick and i am back to the daily smoking struggle. And now work is unbearable, family is unbearable, and also the loneliness.

After (nearly) 5 years of clean time two things are true - my life is immeasurably better and I still think about smoking weed almost daily.

Finding this sub is amazing; I haven't been to a group or meeting in years and didn't realise how much I missed the peer support.

I took drugs from the age of about 16 and after years of abuse this culminated in a few episodes of drug induced psychosis and residential care at an addiction treatment centre. 

Weed was always there, every, single, day. It was the last thing to go back in December of 2014. 

2015 was the worst year of my life. I had no idea what to do with myself, how to sleep, how to eat, how to spend time with friends, how to regulate anxiety and why did music suddenly sound so boring? But there were some silver linings...

I didn't have to worry about running out of weed, I didn't have to wait for unreliable dealers, I could be around my family without them being scared of me, everything became much much simpler.

Over the next four years every single element of my life has improved. My relationships are better, I'm more confident, I go to the gym and have a good job. I'm closer with my family than ever. I eat well, rather than having only one meal a day which is invariably a greasy takeaway. I can hang out with friends when I want and on my terms - without being that weird dude on the periphery that pops outside every couple of hours to smoke. People experience me as a much better person to be around. Also music sounds good again.

Getting free of weed is a fucking tough journey. And it's going to be horrible for a while. Just hang on to those silver linings and enjoy being free of all of the trappings of active addiction. Once you break the back of it everything will improve.

I thought people towards the beginning of their journey may have questions, which I'm more than happy to answer!

Love to you all - the world is a much brighter place once you win your battle!",264

FYI Grounded is a popular app in this subreddit that's all about helping people quit smoking weed/take tolerance breaks.  It features a daily check in system to record cravings and add notes about the craving.  As already mentioned in the title, this was my first check in:

""Sexually frustrated.  Expected to get laid and didn't.  I'm angry and just want to get high so bad.  Took 2mg of Xanax and still just want to smoke.  Xanax doesn't really do much for me.  fuck I hope I don't get drug tested for this job interview.  I'll get so high as soon as I can. really can't wait.  Fuck.  If it wasn't for this potential drug test I'd be high as a kite.  To mask my loneliness and sexual frustration and all the other negative emotions I'd rather not have to feel and process.  Which is really why I need to stop smoking entirely for awhile.  Fuuuck I wish I hadn't just bought weed before finding out about this interview.  It's sitting right there.  Just begging to be burnt.  Goddammit why is this so hard.  I just want to be independent of drugs entirely while still able to use them in healthy ways.  How can I find that balance.  Can I find it at all? Am I really one of those people that just has to abstain forever or be right back where I started?  I'm so lost and confused and dependent on my dopamine fix.  if I could just be close to someone.  hold them and talk about deep shit.  I crave companionship more than anything. I wouldn't need to smoke if I had it.  I wouldn't even have the desire.  All my dopamine would come naturally.  As nature intended.  ugh.  I guess I'm done for now.  Why can't I just be content with being alone and sober.  I feel like I've ruined my brain and emotional capabilities with this drug. I'm dependent on some kind of high, be it caffeine, Sudafed, Xanax, alcohol, benedryl...  but my drug of choice will always be weed.  everything else is just a suboptimal placeholder.  All of which would still be so much enhanced by weed.  Fuck.  I guess I wasnt quite done yet.  I am now.  Gonna go play some video games and try to distract myself.  IMPATIENCE.  I WILL have sex with this girl, I just have to wait a little longer.  We both want it.  Life just intervened.  Do I really want a companion? Or am I just looking for sex as yet another dopamine release to get me though my own madness!?  Ok.  Done.""

""He who has a why to live can bear almost any how""

I've been getting high pretty much daily for the last 10 years, I've tried to quit countless times and always fell flat on my face and the reason simply is this: 

I did not have a strong reason ""why"" I wanted to get sober. I only knew on a sub surface level that I needed to quit but had no vision or plan for life after drugs. This is a huge mistake because without the ""why"" I had no resilience, no grit and just basically couldn't withstand the ""how"" of withdrawal which leads to relapsing and me falling flat on my face, the vicious cycle continues ad infinitum. 

So I guess the main take away is this: In order to successfully recover from addiction you absolutely need to find your why; the reason for which you want to get sober and make a full recovery, whether that be your health, work, family, passion project, side hustle, whatever it is, trust me, It's in there somewhere, even if you can't seem to find it right now, it's there. Years of drug abuse probably buried your truest self underneath a lot of negative mindsets and limiting beliefs and you need to start digging through those and peeling off the layers one by one and you'll find it. Your truest self is yearning to be re discovered and start re engaging with the world. 

And this, I believe, more than anything will make all the difference in the recovery process. 

Hope this was helpful to anyone here. Best of luck to us all on this recovery journey.",10

I haven't been a smoker for a long time.  I grew up straight edge before I even knew straight edge was a thing. I did not drink until around age 26, and did not smoke until 28.   Partly because I didn't like the people around me at the time that did drink and smoke. 

After moving away from home into a new stressful environment the appeal grew more and more.  I met a girl and we moved into a relationship rapidly, but that's a whole different story.   She was a smoker and I felt safe trying the first time with her.  This was in texas and she didnt like keeping paraphernalia around the house so my first smoke was a blunt.  I didnt know what to expect besides finding things funny and munchies.    The first smoke did nothing, but the next day I tried again and actually got high.  Real high.  So high I was crying of laughter on the couch so hard I couldn't breathe. I thought I would be the first person to ever die from smoking weed, and that only made it more funny and harder to breathe.    I was instantly addicted, but didn't know it at the time.   Months go by smoking exclusively blunts.  Probably one a day shared with the gf. 

We move across the country to Oregon. Weed is easily accessible and cheap. I'm smoking more than ever now.  Becoming lazier, more apathetic, and anxious.  Weed numbed it all for me. 

We move again to california.  Get married, and promptly break up.   I was going through divorce in a new place with only one friend.  Weed. 

A year goes by in a blur.  I hardly remember it.   I spent the year trying to get over my relationship and facing fears to learn new coping mechanisms for my anxiety.   I started doing toastmasters, rock climbing, snow boarding, and even went sky diving.  I started to purposefully do things that made me anxious.  Even little things like talking to a stranger on the train, or about my feelings.  I did all of this while high.  

I started to realize something  was wrong with me when I went skydiving.    I was naturally nervous leading up to the jump, but felt nothing during the fall and afterwards.   Where was the excitement in life?  I didn't attribute any of this to weed though. I attributed it to myself.  

More months go by and I realize a big part of my anxiety and stress is cause by financial issues too.  I was spending probably 300 a month on weed at this point.  It's a lot more expensive in california than oregon after all. 

Fast forward to February this year.  3 years of smoking and age 31.  I decide I am no longer going to be buying weed.   I actually decided that before then, but a friend gifted me some jars of home grown for free.  February is when that ran out. 

I quit aside from a few weekend smokes and coworker sessions after work.  Still smoking 3-4 times a week at this point. 

4/20 rolls around and I make an exception to buy more. I get a vape cart and an eighth.  

June rolls around, and I'm still on my 3-4 times a week smoking for free, but it's less.   I buy more for an oregon road trip and end up high 24/7 for a month.   I realize I'm going backwards now and recommit to not buying more.

August comes around.  I've tapered down considerably since my month binge.  Down to weekends only.  I go party with friends in big bear.  I tried molly for the first time, and also accept offers of weed. 

I'm riding the high of molly for two full days free of anxiety and feeling happy. 

A week later since big bear without a single hit.  Labor day weekend.  I finally get my coworkers over for fun at my place.  I have some wine and accept an offer of a vape pen.    This time it's different though.  I could feel the manic feeling of anxiety and realize immediately that the weed is the cause of all this.  My friends all leave around 6pm.  I fall into depression immediately about what a mess that was, and negative thoughts run through my head.  I desperately look for a distraction but end up falling asleep.  I spent the next 2 days binging wow classic from level 1 to 30.   The day after labor day I flew home for 10 days to see family. 

 My unhappiness with life was caused by weed this whole time and I've not only been numbing myself to the bad times, but the good times too.     I no longer crave weed the minute I made those connections about myself. 

I still spend time around smokers, and regularly turn down offers.   I went to a halloween party and had to mention 5 or 6 times I quit.    I crashed at a friends place to sleep who didn't believe me.  She loaded a pipe, and placed it with a lighter on the stand next to my bed.   I said it wasn't necessary, and that I quit.   I woke in the morning, sat up, noticed that pipe within arms reach.   That was it.   In a room alone with nothing but a pipe and lighter, and I still had zero desire to touch it. 

It's only been two and a half months, but it feels like two and a half years since I quit.  Life is more exciting and fulfilling.  I'm sharper, more motivated, happier, and less anxious.   I've learned to feel comfortable dancing and enjoying the company around me.  Life is beautiful.",10

I've started smoking weed with a group of people since I was 14 and couldn't get out of the habit because all my friends around me were all addicts.. All we would do is hangout, smoke and play video games and even skip out on a lot of classes since getting high with buddies sounded more entertaining. This went all through highschool, leaving with me barley passing my highschool diploma.. 

After graduation, I had a breakup, a layoff, so I decided to move out of the city and work in a small town.. thinking it was the right move, ""a new leaf"", a fresh start. However, this later led to severe depression and anxiety. I felt really lonely, I felt really suicidal, and I began the cycle of heavy smoking before bed after work. This went for the next 3 years.. I just let life get by.. 

I decided recently (3 months ago) that I wasn't going to smoke anymore and change my life style, I've been going to school at night to better myself and hopefully go to post secondary next year, however I am getting all these stupid auditory hallucinations, where I can hear the music and I can't get rid of them hence not being able to focus. Also the past week I've been feeling out of touch with reality. The feeling of being high but not actually.. I feel like I woke up and still trying to gain conscious.. is this normal? I'm headed to see a doctor on Monday, but wasn't sure if I should be really concerned or not. I can't concentrate on anything and I feel very frustrated... sorry for my rant..

I didn't think I had a negative relationship with weed. I didn't think I was addicted, I thought I was a moderate smoker.

But people close to me told me I became a different person when I smoked. Insular, anxious and quiet, in my own head which was struggling to splice reality and delusion in both senses of the verb. I was spacey and introspective without sharing the workings of my mind. My memory was absolutely shot but I attributed it to the drugs the doctor ordered. It wasn't until months later that I realized how bad it was that I couldn't follow a conversation without zoning out. I didn't want to let go though. The drug was integrated into my social life and my way of escapism which I mistook for relaxation. 

It wasn't until I finished a substance abuse treatment program that I snapped out of it. I'm a goal-oriented person so I treated each week's drug test like an ultimatum of sorts. It was disappointing to be told this addiction would follow me for the rest of my life and that I WILL relapse. I keep thinking is that a challenge or a command?

Even 10 months later I get sneaking cravings, mostly when I'm upset or stressed. What constantly surprises me is my ability to say no when offered. I think to myself, can the person/people in front of me fathom the clean up? Will this even be enjoyable or will I metamorphize into the smoke I exhale stretching myself thin until I disappear? Will this send me over? 

I still get menu texts from one of the dealers in my phone. Why are they even still in my contacts...",6

2019-11-16 19:49:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dxfkzy/can_i_get_a_second_opinion/,Can I get a second opinion,"So I have like 5 convictions right now, and literally this week I caught the last two for graffiti which in itself is its own thing I always felt compulsed to do. The first time I caught a charge it was pretty much actually police brutality since I was just playing with a airsoft gun in the middle of nowhere with my ex and someone called it in as someone had a real gun (they sent a a apv and I was told after everything they were going to shoot me, literally the only reason I'm alive is that I left before they got there) and that was easy enough to brush off since I was like 19 and it was explained that even though it was a misdemeanor it would go away in 5 years. Fast forward like a year later and the same person who I was with who I always smoked with ended up convincing me to give her money to meet a guy at like 12am late as fuck at night and it goes down and its raining, dark, I'm tired and shes getting mad since I havent found a place to let her roll to smoke. Shes screaming at me and I miss a stop sign and as soon as the cop comes to the window he calls it and the car gets searched. She immediately refuses to even say she knows what it is or that its hers since she apparently doesnt smoke right? So I catch two charges, somehow just ordinace violations (seriously, I dont know why I'm here at this point) for thc and paraphernalia, but those go away after 5 years too. So at this point I'm sitting here like ok, none of this is exactly wholly my fault but its still getting lame taking all these charges and shit but since I decide to forgive her and date her like 2 more years (I had to leave my abusive household and was kind of stuck in the position, plus being dumb and thinking they care fuck my life) and I eventually leave her. 

So here I am smoking for this entire time and getting up and over 300+ tags, throw ups, etc and in college (all the while getting profoundly high marks easily in web and software dev) I figured if I'm already in this position and especially after watching people around me get systematically beat down or even killed it got easy to brush things off as its a systematic thing and that I can still do things with my life (investment property -> expand -> start business -> win at life / help people in same problems) and maybe after the 5 years which was pretty close I got caught and charged with two more ordinace violations for destruction of property (marker tags of all things right? ) and for some reason I still havent had anything other than fines which I'm completely shocked over honestly because I've literally seen lives ruined for nothing. 

So I ended up throwing everything out, including my dro, pax, and prized pilot streaker but I think unless I can convince the system to expunge this later on this is at least sticking. This has actually made me think of just quitting smoking and everything since I'm just tired of things, especially since after thinking about things I never thought I would be alive past 21 for a number of reasons, but I'm a year older than that now and I have no idea how to go to a formal interview if I even get that (and I have to get a internship to graduate this college with a associates degree) with the average populous that already has kind of dismissed me as a person even before I had 5 literal criminal charges. Like I still dont see myself giving up but for some reason I literally just dealt with and am still processing life at this point and I still am debating keeping doing acid and smoking weed which I think at this point is just a unnecessary risk, but especially with weed its so normalized am I really just a bitch for feeling like maybe quitting at least for a while to see how things go for a while isnt too bad?
Either way sometimes it feels like someone out there is looking after me thats not here anymore even though I usually am a firm logic based person, but if anyone somehow read all of this I just wanted a opinion away from all the weed hype honestly, although, if my state legalizes I'm fucking ALL the weed up bruh",1

“Im busy” even if I am not really, I am busy resisting myself. Nobody needs to know because it is my business what keeps me busy. You might get lonely walking around the places you went together, even jealous when you see her in public or at a party. With her lips on someones else’s, when she used to be yours too. She was never loyal, she is in it for dinner and her benefit at what ever cost to you. 
So I got too busy for her, she can still call. But I get to choose to answer now. 

Stay busy, find someone who loves you. Let her leech of some other poor someone.

2019-11-16 04:49:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dx4xi8/day_1_this_time_im_ready/,Day 1 : This time I'm ready...,"...to face this head on without fear or trepidation, to re discover my courage and resilience and to go through the process loving myself for what I am and what I can achieve rather than beating myself over the head over the last 10 years I've wasted smoking myself out of all of life's beauty. 

All of us here know for a fact that drugs are not conducive to our self esteem, productivity and happiness but continue to use regardless. I believe this is inevitable if we focus solely on what we don't want to create rather than what we know deep in ourselves that we want to create. therefore it is imperative that once we do decide to kick the habit to instantly shift gears into a mindset that is radically different than the one that has lead us down this dark road in the first place.

There's actually a huge difference between being dry and being sober.

I've tried to quit drugs countless times and countless times I've failed and it's because of this; I wanted to destroy the habit of smoking up daily but had no concrete plans for what to create and build to take it's place.. and naturally the very strong desire to fill this gap (without any other ""new"" and ""better"" options) will lead to a swift and disappointing relapse, and the vicious cycle continues to spiral downwards.  

We need not feel stupid because of this. Addiction is a disease and without the proper information and planning it will definitely win. You are not a defected person for losing to addiction no matter if its 10, 100 or 1000 times, you were simple not equipped with the proper mindsets and tools to do so successfully, nothing more nothing less. Feeling bad about yourself is a losing game. Honoring and respecting yourself, looking forward to what the future holds optimistically rather than looking back at the wasted years will make ALL the difference. 

Here's a few things that I know will help me out with my recovery, please share yours. I'm very interested to see what this sub thinks of this powerful idea. 

1) start your day off with gratitude: be thankful for all the good things and blessings in your life.. whether that be your family, friends, your job, having a bed to sleep in, food on the table or even just waking up alive for another day (which is the greatest gift imo) ...etc. This will help tremendously with changing your mindset and improving your overall mood. 

2) Make a plan to start doing ALL the things you thought about doing before getting derailed by drugs. This way you start laying out a road map to create the life that wasn't possible when you were on drugs. This should get you excited and actually looking forward to recovery if done correctly and honestly. 

3) Get to work and keep yourself busy. Work on your truest goals, ambitions and dreams that you've laid out in your road map. Don't just sit there doing nothing and leave openings for your old high and dysfunctional self to re emerge and start nagging you to get high. This old self isn't stronger than you per se, but when you do nothing and don't take steps towards the things your deepest and truest self desires, there's no real competition, no positive force against that old self, and it simply wins by default, leading you back to where you were. 

I hope this has helped anyone out in any way. I would love to hear what you guys think of this. Ive been using for a little over 10 years and tried quitting countless times but never had the proper perspective, mindset and work ethic to actually follow through with the process. But now I know better and now I'll DO better.",3

...depending on the person and their needs) with after-care once you graduate. They encourage you to attend twelve step meetings outside of the group, which I find very helpful. 

I was nervous today. I dropped out of the program a few months ago and drank and smoked. I was not shamed one bit when I returned.

Today, for my first day we learned a concept from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). 

Anyway, I am five days sober from pot, and six from alcohol. Haven't had a cigarette either for around the same time. 

Having some withdrawal symptoms. They're not absolutely horrible this time, probably because I'm not doing it alone. I need help with this, and there's no shame in that.

Sobriety doesn't have to be grim! I have a good friend in the program and we hang out and support each other. He's going through a rough time right now, but I have his back and so do many others.

Tried to quit 3 or 4 Times but ended up back in the comfortable cycle of habit. Hoping this can be the time when I finally kick it. For context, I just finished university and moved back in with my parents. Dad has Parkinson’s disease and is really slowing down. It can be a big stress on me and my mom but I am trying to help him without getting super smacked every night. His disability no excuse for my addiction, I am in charge. 

Anyway, the pst 6 days have been rough. Irritable, night sweats, little to no appetite. Had a lil breakdown today and my mom did the thing where she kinda makes it worse and gets upset herself. Makes me feel shitty when she takes my unhappiness personally. Also been thinking about my ex a bit more than usual which is strange considering it’s been a year. Weed let me put a pause on my healing in a lot of ways I guess. Anyway, this has been the toughest day yet. A friend offered to smoke me up and, after thinking for a minute, I told him I was taking a break. I was lucky that he was respectful and understood my motives. It pained me to turn down the offer but I know I can’t moderate my use. For too many years I have been on autopilot.

I had insomnia, anxiety, night sweats, and stomach cramps early on in the week. However the last couple of days all of the physical withdrawal symptoms seem to have passed.  Still not sleeping thru the night but can’t complain.  

I’ve been exercising / doing yoga pretty much daily and trying to drink water and eat healthy.  I believe all of those things are contributing to an easier time withdrawing than last time I quit. 

Definitely feeling happier and more energetic than I can remember in sometime.   Occasionally I’ll get angry when a problem arises out of the blue but I know that’s just my body learning to cope without the crutch of weed.  (Fought with the wife over Xmas lights which felt stupid after I calmed down)

This week a friend offered me a joint and I turned it down which was a good step.   Going camping next weekend with some friends that smoke so I know I’ve still got some willpower battles ahead of me. 

If you are early in your sobriety journey and struggling just know it does get better.",4

So instead, we’d been using my banger on his bong. I decided to stop, and I was cleaning my house to keep busy on Monday. I saw the banger in the bong and made the impulsive decision to take it out and smash it in two on my kitchen floor. Massive regret for about 30 seconds, followed by relief. 

Nobody that I live with knows I have a problem. They knew I had a problem last year, but they thought I was able to cut back to a manageable level. I did for a while, but I went back to daily over the past month or so. I was pretty ashamed of it, so I hid it from them. They’re my teammates, and I’ve been doing really well at my sport especially when I was smoking way less. My performance and motivation started to plateau, so I decided it was time to stop for good. They think the reason I wasn’t doing as well was sickness. It is too embarrassing for me to tell them the real reason. My reputation on the team changed completely when I cut way back, and I’m want to keep it that way. I’ve told them that I am taking a break for a few weeks in anticipation of a big competition so they won’t ask me to smoke with them, but I secretly don’t plan on going back. My training has been going so much better as a result. I am recovering more quickly from workouts and I have more motivation to push myself. It’s a great feeling and I don’t ever want to give it up. 

I came home late last night, and I wanted to smoke very badly. But to smoke, I would’ve needed to grind up the weed and roll a joint instead of just packing a bowl or hitting a dab (it is house weed, so getting rid of it is not an option). That was enough to get me past the initial impulse. If it was easier to smoke, I would’ve done it, guaranteed. Instead, I had some tea, read a book, and went to bed. I woke up this morning feeling refreshed and proud of myself. I went on to crush my workout later that day. I’m starting to be able to breathe so much better workouts too. No more gasping for air like a fish out of water. And knowing it will only keep getting better is keeping me going. Smashing the banger was the best decision I’ve ever made.",4

My mental issues are still as they were before, but some of them have vanished. The main issues I had when I was smoking all the time, was paranoia and ""hallucinations"". I put hallucinations in quotations, as I am not sure whether they were hallucinations or not.   
My paranoia issues have subsided a lot however, and now I only rarely become paranoid anymore. It only happens in situations where my Social Anxiety is going haywire, but I am combating that with weekly therapy sessions.   
One thing that is bothering me however is that I am drinking a lot more than before, and I have even been driving under the influence a couple of times. Not drunk, mind you, but after a couple of beers I have a tendency to crave the Golden Arches. I don't know if it is because of old habits or if it is because I am somehow trying to deal with my emotions. 

&#x200B;

I have no urges to smoke at all and I have nearly forgotten how I felt when I did smoke everyday. 

I have minimal contact with the people I used to smoke with, only through SMS, checking up on how they are doing as friends do. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone here recognize themselves in what I have written and can give me any tips on how to proceed?

Thank's alot!

I am 22 and I've been smoking pot everyday, multiple times a day, for the last 5 years. I have known Jesus as my maker and savior since I was in 5th grade. SHOCKING RIGHT. I always prided myself on the fact that I wasn't one of THOOOSE 'Christians' that put people down for drinking, smoking ect. After all we are equally guilty. Through the years I've progressed in my smoking and kept in contact with Jesus everyday. Always thanking and asking him to guide me. When I was 18 I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a hair color specialist, at this point I was smoking in the evenings only. It wasn't long before I met a group of girls that I had so much in common with, conveniently including smoking pot. Pretty quickly we are smoking every couple hours during school tues- sat, 9-5! Was pretty sweet at the time. Fast forward I graduated and started working a salon, smoked before work, during lunch sometimes and then multiple times after. I couldn't deal with the stress of dealing with people without hazing myself, after all I pretty much learned to do my job while high in cos school.

I would go to work high, go to my boyfriends get really high and the go home and sometimes even sneak outside and do it there. and then repeat. I stopped caring about hanging out with my 15 year old sister. I stopped caring about building a relationship with my 7 year old brother and my older brother who I always looked up to had an idea of what I was up to and I could always see his disappointment. I used all of this as an excuse to get upset or mad at them and keep smoking. \*I would never have admitted any of this before I quit.

My relationships were failing everywhere there wasn't weed. I actually couldn't even keep up with the friends I'd made in school that smoked weed because I was smoking so much. I also felt like a stranger to my family. I ended up moving to a smaller salon where I could have more freedom, when that was too much for my anxiety, I went to a shitty old salon where I self sabotaged and got myself fired. I stopped caring about what I looked like, how I handled my clients and I was just a depressed emotional mess.

When I was fired I hit rock bottom. I started praying to God more often asking him what I was going to do and why this was happening to me. Why did I feel so empty, why was I so left out and misunderstood by my family. I worked for my mom for 5 months, all the while still smoking the reefer continuously. Then I came to a pivotal point in my life. I REEALLY hit rock bottom. I got in a fight with my mom and I lost it, I reeeally lost it. I called my boyfriend to come get me and I took my Bernese, Daisy and I moved in with him and his dad. With no job, and my dog. I was soooo depressed. I stayed in his room for 7 months even with him working a 6-5. I did make up with my parents while I was there but being that my family was always very tight knit, things just weren't the same with anyone. I felt like everyone looked down on me, and thought I was a screw up. All of these things were because of my own guilt, my family was heart broken and concerned for me.

During those 7 months I was asking Jesus to help, I had finally realized I was not able to do anything on my own without his truth and his guidance. I would constantly remind myself that my troubles are his. I had cut myself down so much and with him I was being built AGAIN. However, this process was slow. I was smoking even more regularly in my now Fiances room and the thing is I really didn't even want to. I was numbing the pain and brokenness of the years and relationships wasted.

Finally after months of continuous conversation with Jesus and building my faith and understanding of who Jesus was and who I am in him, he answered a prayer from both of us, we got our first house! It felt like God hugged me and said I have you, I hear year and we are doing this. This was the second step pf my recovery. I finally felt hopeful that I hadn't ruined everything. Even though I was still smoking and feeling really down at times, I felt heard and forgiven.

When we moved in I had the first thoughts about quitting. I would be praying and thanking God and then the thought always ended up in my head 'then quit smoking you don't need it if you have him'. I DID NOT WANT THAT THOUGHT. I wanted to have both. Happiness and Peace through Jesus and weed. It's a pretty convicting thing to experience when you keep thinking something that you don't even want to do. I always managed to push this to the back of my mind, after all, I was still able to thank God and talk to him even when I was high so it was better than the other things I could be doing.

I would smoke a couple times throughout the day while my Husband was at work and the when he got home we would eat dinner and smoke a couple more times, all the while praising the Lord and constantly feeling grateful. Nonetheless I would always end up with that thought ' what does weed have that the lord cant give'. God is good and I believe that he understands addiction fully, he continued to bless me and my fiance, we showed him faith and he showed us mercy.

One day I came across Matthew 23:25 “What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filthy—full of greed and self-indulgence!""... Okay, that hit me like a ton of bricks. I was self indulging in weed. I appeared to be a follower of Christ but the truth was that I was numbing myself to life rather than making myself a clean vessel that he could come in and work through. All those times I had prayed and had those unwelcomed thoughts of Jesus not being enough were right there at the forefront of my mind, I was telling Jesus every time I smoked, you can't fulfill me like THIS can.

You would think that would have been enough for me to quit but addicts always have a way of convincing themselves its okay. So I continued, but this time I had a better plan. I would just read more of the bible, pray more and be a better person. Except I couldn't be a better person because I was too busy smoking weed, I couldn't hangout with my family more because it would interfere. And even when I did I just wanted to go home where I could smoke weed. I prayed that God would help me change multiple times a day. I wanted to be happier, productive, loving and I wanted to make a difference.

Now we're getting to the good part, 6 days ago I had my second Panic attack episode in my life. I was sitting on the floor after a bong rip and out of nowhere I started feeling dizzy, shaky, my heart was pounding and I genuinely believed I was going to die. I barely got to my husband as I cried and prayed aloud as he held me up. While this was going on a thought came into my mind LOUD AND CLEAR. You will never smoke again. I prayed aloud in the middle of the worst feeling I had ever felt in my life, yes Jesus I promise I will never smoke again, I know I only need you, please forgive me I will change. My husband also started praying this and we both decided after a 2 hour episode that that was the last sign we needed.

I can now see looking back that being faithful allowed God to work in my life like I had never expected even when I was growing slowly. He had forgiven me for what I had done and what i continued to do and he interfered at the perfect time every time. Between my husband and I, who I've been with the entire duration of my smoking life, I was always the one who would have a melt down if we couldn't get weed. All of a sudden I had full strength to quit..I FEEL SO EMPOWERED. This is an answered prayer.

I wish I could say that I haven't been experiencing physical symptoms of withdrawal (glass gut, mood swings, irritable, no appetite) but the peace that I have felt with this has been unexplainable. I have not wanted a single hit and I feel so much closer to Jesus when were talking. I feel that my story is proof that though we have free will to make our own mistakes, If you ask him to Jesus will use these for good even if you don't see how. Without this journey my husband and I would not have the unbreakable bond with Jesus, each other and our family that we share fellowship with. I have so much sympathy and understanding with those struggling in life to get their peace and I can assure you that this type of peace is infinity times better than grade A bud.

SO much healing has taken place in my life in the last year, I am not the same person that I was and I feel so connected with my creator and ready to serve him for however long I have left.

&#x200B;

TIP\* In order to stop myself from thinking about smoking during the times that I would usually have I am having my siblings over and keeping myself busy with my new business and talking with my best friend Jesus!

God is so good.",2

Weed isn't on my mind really yet. Like I've said before, i have fleeting thoughts of getting high and moderation. 

But i'm 100 percent certain I'll never be able to moderate. So the thought is almost laughable to me. 

My back is about 90% better, thank goodness. And that's about it, i can't think of much else. 

I'm feeling happier in general. And it's a relief to not have a second full time job chasing weed, buying weed and smoking weed.

Will my thoughts come back?,"I quit smoking 4 weeks ago after binging on the stuff daily for around 5 months. I’m talking 2-3grams/ day at least, sometimes getting up to 4. I used to be highly intelligent and could remember everything at the first time of asking (names, entire basketball box scores, information at school/ entire conversations etc etc), however- now I’m off the green- I’m struggling to put together coherent sentences; both verbally and written. I also feel like my brain has completely switched off, I.e, I have no thoughts and can’t even recall conversations that happened 5 minutes ago.  I have to physically try to retain anything, care about things I used to love or even have a thought. I still recall conversations happening, however, I remember nothing from them. I used to also be able to remember conversations, facts, pieces information from years ago without fail... now I can’t even remember what it was like being in elementary school or when I first started playing certain sports or anything like that. I’m aware my being aware of this only makes the effects of it worse, however, it if definitely something I am suffering with. I also forget what basic words or phrases mean and don’t trust myself to be correct in any given situation. I used to be the most assured guy you could ever have the pleasure (or displeasure at times due to how resolute (I had to look that word up; my vocabulary used to be extensive) I could be when I thought I was right), but this has since completely changed. My main concern is that my memory will return to the way it was if I give it up. I’ve seen on here that other people suffer/ have suffered with this and would like some reassurance that I will go back to the way I was as I am seriously concerned I have done some permanent damage. I also need to start living as I lived life to toke as opposed to toking to improve life. Did anyone else return to their normal selves after starting afresh after quitting? I hope that you have if you can relate to any of this.

Today, I was blessed to be in the company of two very successful contemporaries, both known world-wide for their work. They were charming, and capable of carrying on great conversations with strangers. 

My thought were: ""what what it must feel like to believe in yourself and in your work, care about it enough to persist, keep smiling and talking about the same crap you smile and talk about every day"". 

Feeling very not good at my job, uninspired by anything, I believe the word i ""adohenia"". 

This dump into the ""goo"" of negativity started yesterday. Just feelings of dispair...like there is no point to anything, and I just fritter my time away running pointless errands, sitting in traffic. 

Then, to dinner with folks 20 or so years older than me. They had their wine, wife is glad the nail salon is moving by the pet spa so she get can get her nails and her dogs nails done at the same time, and I just want to die thinking that this is the boring, bougie life I'm going to live as a sober grown up. 

I fall in to these pits and I have a very hard time getting out. I feel like I know people who spend their life this way, just looking at everything through the lens of dispair, anger and negativity. and I really don't want to be one of those people. Weed altered my perspective, and I'm having a hard time breaking free from the clutches of ""the goo"". 

So here I am...I didn't hit up my dealer, and instead I'm just writing it all out. Thanks for listening.",45

He spent Saturday night calling my moms house all night because he was worried about his life situation. My moms boyfriend talked to him for a couple of hours. 

Today we find out he’s threatening to kill himself. As far as we know, he was being seen by a Psychiatrist today. Hopefully they can help him. 

Psychiatry has told him before he needs to quit smoking. He has a million issues thanks to his addiction but to him, “weed isn’t the problem”. He’s worse off than most of the people in this group. He says he’s not addicted, “he just doesn’t want to stop.” We all know that’s a classic addict talking.

It’s hard to cope with having family issues. I used to smoke to deal with him.

But both times this week, I didn’t smoke. I’m proud of that.",5

I decided to quit... again 30 days ago. I've been smoking for 20 years and I felt lost and unproductive. With my previous attempts, I would feel the ""pressure"" of my spouse smoking and having weed around me. I would usually just smoke because he would. This time, I took it as a challenge from GOD. I know there is something great in store for me. I also know, I won't receive it until I take weed sobriety seriously. So, this time, I fasted and prayed for one week. Only water and GOD. I am literally sitting in front of weed right now and have no desire to smoke! I'm proud of my progress, so is my spouse. He's cut back a lot. He has no desire to stop and I have no desire to influence his decision. I think that's why it's working. He also has been smoking outside or in another room ( it's getting cold) which is considerate and helpful. I'm grateful I decided to take my life back. I was so cloudy and unfocused. I get joy now in the simplest things. I went vegan after my fast and, cooking is so fun! I'm learning new techniques, forced to think outside the box, and most importantly, I feel so light and airy being plant based! I sleep well (besides the lucid dreaming about smoking), my stomach stopped hurting, and time has a totally different meaning. So, for anyone who is just starting out, know that one day at a time, heck, one minute at a time is all you're in charge of. Don't beat yourself up, breathe, meditate, ask for help from your higher power, and have faith that you are enough. GOD bless everyone going on this journey. This community has really helped me. Even if you don't post, someone out there is going through a similar situation. We're here for each other!",14

For some reason that particular afternoon I took a few minutes to journal about how I was feeling.  And then I got back into this subreddit.

I thought last week was my 7 week mark, but I miscounted.  So I am 7 weeks away from weed as of today.  As always, it feels like much longer, but I like that. It's great to get a grip on the time warp of weed. 

I am feeling very positive at this time.  Experiencing no temptations at all so far.  After going through the first few weeks of paws stuff, I don't look forward to dealing with that again. 

I did have a few distinct panic/anxiety bouts this week.  But that's way better than the alternative of riding the weed coaster of constant anxiety.

Really battling with my adhd stuff.  Probably spending way too much time here on /r/leaves when I should be working or doing other stuff.  But it feels good to participate and vent with my people. 

My lower back has been out and hitting a nerve for a few weeks. The last few days it seems to finally be feeling a bit better. Part of me wonders if it's related to the paws, but probably just bad timing. 

I guess now I need to get going on some other self improvements now that I am feeling a lot more stable.",2

I told my friend about my struggling in the quiting process and he shared with me posts from this community that were really helpful for me. Today I feel really sad and I wanted to share my story cause I would like to have some feedback. Btw Im not from a English speaking country so forgive me for the bad spelling in some words. 

Well I started to smoke When I was 17, now Im 23. I have smoked hash for absolutly everyday (also weed but mainly hashish). When I woke up, I smoked one. After
lunch, another one. Waiting for the bus, another one. Meeting my friends, another 4. Going to sleep, another one or two. What I mean Is I had a joint in my mouth 24/7.
During the last year I didnt smoke that much, only by night, but it was also daily. The problem started 2 months ago: I had a huge panic attack after smoking and I thought I was going to die that night. I had some paranoia episodes before but never felt so bad and scared. I went to the hospital the next day and after checking me they said I was ok, but I had an anxiety attack probably because of canabbis.
Since that day I didnt smoke any weed or hash, but the anxiety attacks continue and the depression.
The worst part Is that almost everyday come to my mind thoughts that tell me Im going to die soon. For no reason. Im young, I have not any illness but this thoughts still come. Sometimes I also think that life make no sense. Im not thinking about suicide, I wont do that, but Is awful living like this, with this thoughts.
I dont have the needness of smoking a joint since the panic attack 2 months ago, but I feel like my mind and body are going crazy. I felt better during the last week but last night I got drunk and today the anxiety, depression and those thoughts are back again.
The thing that frustates me a lot Is the fact that I quit because of that panic episode that I had, but even if I quit and my body shouldnt have any THC after 2 months, Im still scared, anxious and depressed.
Any comment will be helpful, I dont want to smoke again, I just want these fear feeling to go away and be the happy person I used to be, without being afraid of life irrationaly.",5

After a 1-2 months of that I could feel the drain in my dopamine. My runners high was less and I was less motivated to run.  So I cut down as much as I could.

I ended up finishing my marathon however I realized the true detriment of weed. I was slower' had less lung capacity and less motivated.

I came to terms with the fact that I'm an alcoholic and an addict.  I created this account and joined r/StopDrinking and have started attending AA meetings.  I can't talk about my alcoholism without recognizing the big green monster in the room.  Throughout my life, if I was drunk, I wanted to get high, and if I was high, I wanted to drink.  The two always went hand-in-hand for me.  However, my first and greatest love was, and always will be, weed.  I smoked for the first time when I was 12, started smoking regularly at the age of 15, then continued to smoke on a daily basis until I hit my 30's.  

When I met my wife, it was one of the first things I brought up in conversation.  I made sure she was cool with it and she was.  We even did it together and had some good times, but she was never into it quite as much as I was.  It wasn't until we moved in together that she saw how much I was really doing it and that's when she made attempts to get me to slow down.  Well, if someone tells you to slow down, what are you going to do?  Start doing it behind their back, that's what.  I spent years hiding my abuse from her.  I smoked at night after she went to bed, during the daytime while she was out, even in the shower when I got home from work.  Any way I could fit in a few puffs without getting caught.  This eventually escalated when we moved to a new state.  I didn't have a connection anymore, so I substituted weed with booze and cigarettes.  This went on for some time until I met someone at work that was able to get me some bud, so I was back in the game.  At this point though, the other stuff had taken hold.  I was now drinking and getting high in secret.  I honestly don't know how I was able to keep it going for as long as I did.  

Once I finally came clean, it scared her how good I was at lying.  She couldn't understand how I could just straight up lie to the face of someone you're in love with and committed to spending your life with and raising a family together.  I had been caught in a few lies here and there and I thought that she ""knew"" to some extent, but I was wrong.  She really had no idea how bad it was.  This is the life of an addict.  A web of lies.  I'm just lucky I never lost a job, got a DUI, or ended up dead.  So here I am, trying to make amends and put our life back together.  I know it will take some time to regain her trust, but I am taking every step possible to make sure I never have to lie to anyone again.

I can’t control myself, when i buy some i need to smoke it asap, I’ve lied and stolen for you just to keep you close. 
For almost a year I want to stop using you but I can’t. I started having withdrawals from you...
I’ve finished all my remaining herb, my friends know I’ve made a deal to keep off for a while.
My mind is foggy, I don’t know who I’m or what I want... I want to quit you, I want to do more art, I want to feel in control... but then I also wanna keep binging and running away from myself.

How do I handle seeing other people smoke weed and live their lives?

...Actually I kinda have the answer to that, regarding other people and their habits:

A. If they do it just once in a while, then that’s not me for sure. There’s no such thing as “get high once in a while, once a month, etc” for me... I love it way too much and I do it to the point where it consumes me and then swallows me whole, and turns on me. Then things get REALLY ugly. I don’t even know what normal use looks/feels like and to even attempt that would be torturing myself. I know that I have NO control. 

B. If they do it every day... they’re dependent. Plain and simple. Things could be really shitty for them, for all I know. And even if things aren’t shitty, smoking every single day is sad. That’s missing out on so much life and so many experiences. And I wouldn‘t want an existence that revolves around weed.",8

Time flies. Certainly doesn't feel like 9 months. There have been times that I've thought I never wanted to smoke again, and other times where I thought I would give in. But i've persisted. I have a job interview next week, I'm finally almost fully recovered from a serious injury suffered back in February (big reason I decided now was the time to try the sober thing), and the weight is starting to fall off me now that I've been more active and eating better. I'm having just as much fun as my friends when I'm around them when they're smoking, if not more fun. My original goal was to go at least a year sober. No booze, no weed. And until I move out of my parents house and lose another 35ish pounds I wouldn't consider picking either of those back up. I never felt like an alcoholic or addicted to weed, I just knew that I was using both of them to hide from my problems and not face the things I need to do to get better. Lighting up a joint at that time in my life just started to feel wrong. I felt stuck in life and felt like I was celebrating for nothing. And I knew I needed to make a change. So when I got hurt, it gave me the perfect reason to quit cold turkey and try to get my life back on track. Even though the physical therapy has been hell, it's truly been a blessing in disguise. I still found plenty of ways to procrastinate and put things off. Which only showed me that weed and booze weren't the problem, they were a shitty solution to my problems. Sobriety has given me the clarity and self awareness to dig deep to the root cause of my problems and find what is holding my back from achieving the things I want to achieve. I still have some ways to go until I accomplish my goals. But not having to worry about drinking or smoking has made focusing on my goals a lot easier. And who knows, even when I meet those goals, I still might just stay sober. Even if I do get back on the sauce or start smoking again, I feel like I have a much better relationship with weed and booze being off it for so long and a whole new perspective and awareness of how I treat them. And if i feel like things are slipping and I just am better off staying away from them completely, I am totally okay with that. Being sober aint that bad anyway. But hey, i'll cross that bridge when I get there. If you've made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read this and thank you to this entire community for allowing us all to spew our thoughts and give feedback to one another.

Every night at around the time I'd usually smoke for a week or two after I quit I would be laying in bed and suddenly feel different. I would be put in a strange almost dissociated headspace.

Thanks to all of you and some advice to those starting,"8 months of smoking straight this year, from March to October with minimal breaks. My reliance on weed was heavy, and just made all the problems in my mind and in life super foggy, and made it seem that everything was fine. 

For those of you just starting, quitting is no easy task; here are some tips:

-Have someone to talk to about your problems whether it is this reddit or one of your best friends. Being able to talk out your problems is a key.
-Get the app grounded, it’s good and healthy to celebrate the milestones
-Expect anxiety, do not let it get into your head. You need to let it happen and feel it out and let it pass. If it gets too extreme try this exercise:
Name 5 things you can see
4 things you can feel
3 things you can hear
2 things you can smell
1 thing you can taste
-At least for me, sleeping was the hardest part for me. I want to remind you, you slept at a time for years WITHOUT WEED. It’s gonna be tough, just keep going and it will get better
-KEEP reminding yourself why you quit
- If you ever have desires, play the tape forward; how will you feel the next day after smoking?
- Make sure you don’t have any weed in your house
- This May be the hardest part but for the beginning, don’t surround yourself near people who smoke. This will make you so much more inclined to smoke and it’s hard because some of these people could of been some of your best friends, you are better without them.
- and lastly you got this. If you are ever freaking out or thinking of relapsing, just post here, we are here to help

You always hear the saying “weed doesn’t kill you?”. This may be true, but how about all the lives weed has ruined, lead to extreme depression and anxiety, intense paranoia, and make it seem like everything is okay in life. You never hear about that?!

Well that’s all I have to say, thank you all for responding to my posts and helping me out in my beginning weeks, and I hope this helps at least 1 person out there!",3

So I'm a month clean from weed. I haven't gone this long in over two years.

There are times I still crave it, but I recognize the feeling and let it pass. Every time I do, I'm proud of how strong I am. Although quitting weed (one day at a time) has forced me to face some uncomfortable emotions, I am ultimately grateful for the chance to grow. I find that I trust myself more, and feel more connected to people around me. I also have more empathy, perhaps because I am learning to accept myself as I am, no longer trying to cover up the fact that I'm an addict. I have a lot more energy to pour into building my life now that I'm not lying to myself and others around me with twisted games of ""I bet they cant tell I'm high... can they?"" Or ""this helps me be my best self."" Or dreaming and fantasizing but not DOING.

Seriously. It's like I had this whole fantasy world in my head that I'd escape to when I was high.

I've accomplished so much this month, and I get ""high"" off of getting stuff done. There's a lot more to do, that's for sure. I've heard that you have to replace your addiction with something else... that's been my approach this time, and it is working.

There is still room to grow, but the clarity I experience now is it's own reward.

The big difference for me this quit is going to AA and NA. I'm actually totally sober now too, which is cool. I respect myself for that. The great boon about meetings is that they keep me accountable; I am counting days and sharing that with a group, and I'm motivated to keep it up now that I'm surrounding myself with people who are also actively dedicated to their sobriety. One day at a time-thinking is also key for me... if I think about never smoking again, it puts me in that mindset of scarcity that caused me to relapse so many times. 

It's not easy, but it is simple. Here's to another day sober and clean.",5

I ended up in hospital and then respite care. I am now on good medicine and support. The benefits of that breakdown: i realised I hated myself, not just everything else. I realised I wasnt living with any kind of real intention or integrity, and that pissed me off. I realised my anger and frustration at everything was projection, and that I really need to work on learning to like me again. I do, but i havent PRACTICED liking myself in such a long time .. that I forgot how to self-validate and all that good stuff. I dont want to put myself in a position where I have to seek outside approval - including from weed. I can do this.",18

They are so vivid that they cause me to wake up every few hours with intense anxiety & a pounding heart, it makes me really nervous because I'm quite a hypochondriac. It's almost as if my mind is in disbelief by what it's experiencing so it just wakes me up. I don't have much anxiety during the day but as soon as I go to sleep, all hell breaks loose.

I first started smoking the cabbage with friends in a park which I now walk in for time to think and reflect. As odd as it is... this park now represents my introduction to, and AH-HA... fuck... I neeeeed to stop doing this, moments. I have been consuming marijuana for 16 fucking years. It started with me getting high, eating food with friends, and laughing. Then it moved into the realm of partying \[Lil Jon got 'crunk', so we did too!\]. After this, the smoking it alone and all the time phase came. And, dear lord... I had no idea there was a ""smoke until you fall asleep"" phase, but I am now there. It's an issue, and it costs me money, time, and likely might start tugging at my mental health \[it's already knocking at the door and probably has been for a while now\]. Generally speaking; I need to stop, now.

The last time I was here I had lasted \~40 days'ish. I found this place to be a sanctuary of sorts, so, naturally, I am back. For me, there was a specific reason why I smoked as much as I did. I am working through that, and it seems that it might be a bit of a process. But, I am cool with it.

Probably moving towards rambling territory, so I will stop it there. I just wanted to check-in with everyone. I look forward to talking with you folks, bouncing conversation, and/or developing rapport with a few people",16

I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm 27 and still dealing with the same problem that's plagued me since I was 12. Addiction to pot seems like an insidious, unending curse. I'm at point where I'm not sure what can be fixed and what's predetermined. Off and on, I've tried everything it seems: AA, NA, MA, outpatient treatment, sincere declarations to quit once and for all etc. It's hard to rely on myself or my own word. I always relapse after about two to three weeks of sobriety. This has been a horrible cycle spanning about 6 consecutive years now. I know I would be capable of some truly great things if I can find a way to finally be free from active addiction...and keep it that way. I'm on day 1 right now, in the midst of withdrawal, in pain, and willing to try again. I just feel like I've exhausted all of my resources. Moments of clarity like this are fleeting, I've learned. I hope in two to three weeks time, and beyond, when this pain has subsided, that I can find the strength and presence of mind to withstand those inevitable, warm, hungry cravings to get high and hide from the world. At the deepest core of my being, freedom from this is all I truly want, but there exists this other person inside of me who wants one thing, and one thing only by any means necessary. After so many relapses, faith is really difficult to maintain, but I hope I can do this, despite so many failures in doing so. I wish all of you success with your sobriety, very happy lives, and the acquisition of everything you're looking for in this world. I hope one day I'll have the ability to join you.",3

I know this subreddit is for people trying to quit and technically I have done that but my issue is now is that I feel so bored and unfulfilled in the evenings that part of my mind keeps rationalizing just smoking a bit. I really don't want to go down that slippery slope. My boyfriend is getting back into gaming, not like obsessively but he has this recreation where he is socializing with his friends and letting off steam. I'm sat in the living room just watching Netflix and  getting resentful that he's having fun and I'm just missing when I would be high doing this. 

I am open to all suggestion because I want to stay weed free and keep my relationship healthy. For some context I am pretty fit, do yoga, meditate and journal daily. It's dark out here in Canada when I'm done work and theres a lot of snow so not really open for outdoor activities.

I’ve been smoking cannabis almost religiously since I was about 12/13 yrs old, anywhere from an 1/4 to half oz a day at least. when I was 19 I spent a month in jail, and it was the longest I had ever stopped smoking completely.
I used it for pain (I’m 29 and looking at my second back surgery in the next few months, trust me, I know pain very well) as well as anxiety, and a range of other issues that I felt like it was helping with.

I haven’t stopped smoking completely as of now but due to my financial situation and some other factors, my intake has slowed to almost nothing over the last few weeks, maybe a gram over the last week, IF that, and I’m completely fine with it. 
It’s been about 4-5 days since I’ve smoked any significant amount. But now I’m starting to realize that my dreams are insanely more vivid. Not AS lucid as the dreams I had before I became a pothead, but they’re getting very close to that point again. 
Is this normal?

I can only assume that it progresses more and more as my body gets used to not having cannabis anymore, and honestly I’ve been enjoying the hell out of it! I’ve been trying to figure out why I couldn’t have dreams anymore, or why I couldn’t control them if I do for the last ten years or longer,  I’ve always attributed it to my brain injuries since I’ve had about 8 or more Traumatic brain injuries as of now. But, if this is what has to happen to be able to have those types of dreams again, I’m all in. 
When I was younger I used to have the most lucid dreams I’ve ever heard of. I could fly, breath underwater, manifest physical objects into existence just by thinking it, and I was always aware of the fact I was dreaming. 

Lastnite I became 100% lucid and aware in a dream for the first time since I was 14 or 15, and it was pretty refreshing to have that feeling and ability again. 
This is normal right? Please tell me I’m not crazy haha

TLDR; I’ve started having very vivid and lucid dreams again for the first time in 15 years since I have drastically slowed my cannabis intake down over the last couple of weeks, wondering if this is normal",3

This is the first time i'm admitting i have a problem... the mood swings/waking up in the middle of the night dripping with sweat/trouble eating is too much for me to keep denying.

I feel so stupid that i'm having this much trouble because im so used to ""its just weed. Its not like coke or something."" I mean, I've been the one who has told people that, but even though i want to quit i found myself looking at weedmaps 5 min before i started writing this.

I didnt get anything, and instead found a couple of articals about the effects of weed and strategies to quit, and found this subreddit. I still want to smoke though... 

I just know if i start i'm going back to the timless abyss where nothing productive ever gets done. Ill go back to smoking instead of persuing all the hobbies i had before. Ill just work and be high... and at that point i'm not really living.

I was introduced to them 3 years ago at age 16 and have not turned back. I hit mole bowls multiple times a day, every single day since Ive discovered them, as disgusting and ashamed as I feel to say that. 

It probably doesn’t help that I usually only smoke from my bong too. That initial head rush followed by the calming effects of weed is what consistently keeps me coming back. But I feel it starting to control my life and I want to stop before this goes any further or takes a serious turn. I just don’t know how. I literally don’t know how or where to start, what to do, how to stay consistent, I know everyone is different and I probably need to just figure it out on my own. I guess I am just looking for support right now more than anything else, because man this shit is soo fucking hard for me and I haven’t even tried quitting yet. 

I’m dreading it so much but I know it needs to be done. I miss appreciating weed for the magic it truly is, I miss actually getting high off a bong rip and not needing tobacco to send me over the edge, I miss not having my life consumed by thinking about hitting a bowl. It’s definitely changed my social patterns too as far as me always blowing people off, dreading certain events (even if I am excited for them???) my attention span is so short I can’t even sit and watch a movie or show anymore. Of course everyone is different and has different experiences. I just don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to stop forever but I definitely want to take an initial break for maybe a couple years and then go back to only doing it every once in a while as a treat??? But we all know how that usually ends up. 

Anyway, sorry if any of this came off pessimistic or whatever. I am just in a weird phase of my life right now that I never would’ve imagined myself being in, and I genuinely don’t know what to do or where to go. I just know I need some support or people I can relate to because this will be a rough fucking journey. 

As much as I hate to admit it, abusing weed and tobacco the way I have these past few years is definitely turning me into someone I don’t like. I miss feeling like my old self but I feel like that girl is long dead and gone and it makes me so sad.

smoking weed was fun at first, and much regulated; but i just lost its track, and since about 6 years ago i cant remember the last time i was sober... it just slipped through my fingers for 6 fucking years, and believe me realizing such a thing can be horrendous.

And I go straight to my computer and watch mindless shit most mornings, instead of smoking a joint ilke when I was smoking. I'm on forums for these addictions as well, I guess I know I'll just have to fight a war of attrition with them like the weed. 

What I'm worried about is that this whole process is just a game of whack-a-mole and I'll never actually feel whole outside of when I'm gorging in some kind of addiction. I'm glad I have gotten this far with the weed and alcohol but I expected to feel happier and more content with life this far in. The numbness hasn't left and neither have the addictive predilections, they've just re-routed.",3

I’ve been smoking since I was about 15 (I just turned 28). Most of the time I was smoking daily, but this ranged from HEAVY use (I’m talking multiple blunts a day in my early 20s) to 1-3 hits a day in the last 2 months or so. I have to quit completely by 1/1/20 to be able to pass a hair test when I graduate in May (I know it only takes 3 months but I’m playing it safe, idk when I have to take this test). 

As of yesterday I ran out and I’m toying with the idea of not picking up. I’m thinking of this as a “dry run” of you will, in case I slip up. So here are my questions. What can I expect for withdrawal symptoms? I know I only smoked a few hits each day but it was every single day without fail. Are there things I can do to help mitigate these symptoms? How did you guys handle this?

I’m already experiencing some depression and irritability. No sleep issues or decreased appetite yet, but a few light headaches. What else can I expect?

I have been smoking almost daily for 2/3 years I love it still.  I love coming home having a couple hits and (I’ve been telling myself I’m forcing myself to relax), I love getting together with friends and sharing stories while we smoke or going out to take a break from a party and enjoying the quiet while I smoke.  But I’ve been thinking for half a year that I should quit or at least reduce my smoking to once or twice a week if I have that will power. I still love it and want to do it but I feel like if I’m haunting myself with the thought that I should quit for so long that it’s probably what I want and need.  It also has affected my performance with my hobbies at work and the state of my house isn’t as great as it could be.  

I have no idea where to start.  Or how.  The few times I have abstained from it most of the day, by the end I’ve convinced myself I’m nauseous and need it to kill that or that I feel no desire to eat so I’ll smoke for an apetite.   

I tried finding that grounded app but it does not seem to be available where I am.  
I could possibly try a manual written version of it?

Thank you in advance",2

A friend who encouraged me to sit on the couch and not worry about anything, ever, even when there was stuff going on that I should probably have been a little worried about. I am really dependent on this friend and she lets it happen, doesn't push me to get out of my comfort zone or seek other stimulation. But despite the perhaps maladaptive nature of our relationship, she has *always* been there for me. For better or worse. She's a bad relationship that I'm in because it's comfortable and I am uncertain and afraid of what life would be like without her. She's connected me to other human friends who have this same dependent relationship with her. We were all dependent on her together, in our own ways. I feel like I'm losing a whole network as I try to say goodbye to her. All the times spent talking, planning, walking to a spot, prepping, lighting up, sharing stories, sharing goodies, consoling one another, asking questions, learning about each other's lives, and just feeling a relaxed feeling together. I'm saying goodbye to all of this and it's hard. How do y'all cope with losing a friend like this? How do I go about life without this one thing that's always been a part of me? How do you make connections with people without this bridge (or really I should say crutch) to connect you? 

Tomorrow is my quit date and I'm scared. I've been commenting here a bit to try to bolster my confidence. I'm typing out what I know to help cement the truth in my mind. I want to be ready, I just don't know if I am. I'm scared and sad and I miss her already and don't know how to get through that without her.",9

I'm no longer obese, I've lost 24 kg (53 lbs) in those 2 years. My health improved exponentially, so did my mood and overall feeling about life.

I'm no longer sedentary, lingering in the couch like I was before. I became a strong swimmer and a bodysurfer. I ride pretty nice waves and I'm having the time of my life. I travel to the beach almost every week in order to seek that awesome feeling, this is what drives me now.

During the week I swim, lift weights sometimes, walk the dog, diet hard, everything in order to bodysurf better, always thinking about the next session in the sea. 

I've never had this kind of drive in my life, pot had stolen all my dreams and goals, I used to just want to smoke and sit in the couch, play videogames and eat, it was really depressing.

I've recently even found a way to not hate my job, that's not an easy task, I don't exactly like to work, but I guess now I see thing from a practical perspective. I feel like a full grown adult for the first time in my life. Life is not all joy and comfort, it's struggling and survival, and it's a privilege to have some hapiness in between all the struggle.

I could say I'm a completely different person now, but I'm pretty much the same guy, just an improved version of the same guy. My wife couldn't be happier about it, and it makes me proud to have been able to be better for her.

Recovery made me feel proud about myself in life, with a feeling of accomplishment and peace.

I hope everyone can find this peace in recovery, and I'm here for you if you need me.

I rarely post on reddit-- I mainly just lurk and read random things from time to time, but in my time on this site I stumbled upon this subreddit. I had been looking around online for tips for other people as to how they helped wean themselves off weed and wanted personal inspiration.

A little bit about me: I am 23 and started smoking when I was about 18 or 19. I didn't smoke in high school, but when I went to college I found a group of friends who introduced me to it and I soon fell in love with the stuff. From my freshman year all the way until my last semester of graduate school, I have been a habitual user. I can probably count the days I didn't smoke in the past few years on one hand. My undergraduate degree is in information security, and I am finishing my Master's in Data Science. Nothing made programming easier to palate than a nice burn. My grades were unaffected from my usage, as I genuinely enjoyed my studies and rightfully put it above all other things. However, as my time in university is coming to a close, reality is setting in and I am beginning to search for jobs to start my career. Naturally, with many jobs comes a urine test, and I would rather stop now and have less to worry about in 2020.

I would re-up weekly, probably burning through a quarter or so. As a result, I ended up wasting a lot of money and would have nothing to show for it. As time went on, smoking began to feel like a chore and I wasn't enjoying it as much as I used to. I felt like I was becoming alienated from my friends, where I would just be awkwardly high and socially anxious. I don't like that feeling of impending doom it brings only for like an hour high. I would have daily goals for myself of what I would want to do and start out being productive, however I would take a hit of my wax pen and then fall into a rabbit hole of watching random youtube documentaries or whatever I found interesting at the time. I have had the mindset to quit for a while, and I would always tell myself, ""This is the last bag you get, enjoy it while it lasts."" To my chagrin I find myself back at my dealer's place for another.

Weed is really the only drug I enjoy and consider it my daily driver. I am not the biggest fan of alcohol, and would rather chief a bowl and watch The Sopranos. By going cold turkey I intend on just remaining sober for an extended period of time. Maybe once I secure a job in a field I enjoy, then I might consider rewarding myself. But even then, I would rather say I beat the habit and no longer have a need for it anymore.

I recently ran out of wax two days ago and have been thinking about it from time to time, wondering if I'm going to go and collect more this week, or if this really is the time I make a stand and quit cold turkey. I don't really like the idea of having a reputation as a pothead, and consider being clean and professional the better choice.

I've read some of the stories people have left here and it moved me to the point to where I sat down at my desk and typed all of this out. I am trying to keep myself busy in any way, shape or form to keep my mind occupied.

Any helpful comments or reassurance would genuinely be appreciated. Thank you all for your time and I wish everyone else who is in the same situation the best. :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: After a few months sober, I was able to secure a security analyst position as well as a significant other. Crazy how much you can accomplish when you set your mind to goals and not waste time getting high every hour. To everyone else out there who needs encouragement, it really does get better with time. Nowadays I am a very busy man and don't even have time to smoke even if I wanted to, so it's ultimately for the best. I do not miss it, and I feel much more focused and with more mental clarity than I used to many months ago when I was a chronic smoker. Good luck to everyone else and to whoever reads this. :)",4

But then i moved to the next big city with two friends, wich were smoking. And nearly from this moment on i started to smoke daily.
Then i started to smoke bong.
For almost 4 years now i‘ve trained myself to smoke a head and then go to bed. And if i woke up in the night, i would smoke another one just to get back into my dreamland.

I‘ve already worked on it. I meditate before going to sleep. I’ve tried to fall asleep again, after waking up, without smoking another head. But i‘m just starting in my days earlier now.
And today i tried to fall asleep without smoking, but it didn‘t worked at all. It’s 4:20 am atm and i really need help, tips or tricks. Do you have any tips beside doing sport or drinking valerian tea?

I get through the days pretty easy but the part where i should sleep is a nightmare atm.

Or do i just have to get throught this for some days to be done with the sleeping issues?

Day 43 was hard and I smoked. But this time it became a daily thing. I would get about 4 days sober and smoke for a week or two. I’ve been high about 75% of the past month. 

However, with each relapse I’ve found a new negative effect weed had on me. I’m grateful for those realizations. 

The worst part is the shame I feel about my relapses. My family knew I stopped smoking but they don’t know about my relapses. Whenever they would bring up that I stopped smoking, I didn’t have it in me to tell them. This is the 1st time I’ve had the courage to tell this group about my relapse. It’s a hard burden to carry. I feel like a complete fraud. I’m just so ashamed. But I am working on building myself back up and staying on the correct path. 

I hope every person on here knows how incredibly proud I am of each of you. Even if you are on your own relapse, it’s okay. I know how hard it is. We will make it.

I’ve been wanting to quit for so long and I’m nervous and scared and afraid to be myself but I know it’s not how I want to spend my life anymore. 
It’s been 7 years of daily smoking. 
I don’t have a sense of smell and I miss dreaming. 
I don’t get out of the house and instead I smoke. 
I can’t solve the root of my anxiety and depression because of smoking. 
I want to be better for my future me.
A big reason, I think, for a fear of quitting is because of how other people in my life view it. They don’t think you can get addicted but I did. Two of my best friends from high school used to make fun of people who said they couldn’t quit. I think there’s a lot of shame in feeling like I have no self control. Feeling like i don’t have ownership of this choice to not smoke. 
I know it’s going to be tough and a lot of lonely struggles but i need to start somewhere.

I find it much more difficult to start conversations with new people and keep them going.  I also can't enjoy alcohol as much as I once did unless I'm crossfading and I'm constantly looking for an excuse to cut social situations short so I can go home and smoke.  It's also turned me into a very boring person since I don't really have many hobbies anymore other than smoking weed.  Has anybody else experienced this?",8

Or so I thought.  I’m not so sure anymore. 

One day I was a college student smoking for the first time in the wild woods of Michigan — then the next 20 years whooshed by in a blur of purple haze. 

As the big 4-0 birthday approaches, sadly my body is telling me that cannabis is no longer something it wants. I don’t even get a say in it. My body has spoken.

Smoking or even eating cannabis now doesn’t lead to that dreamy, buzzy, stimulating high. Now it just triggers intense headaches, irritated and pressure-filled dry eyes, itchy skin, and angry pimples. 

I’ve tried to quit so many times before but this time it feels like my body is seriously warning me that this needs to be the last and final attempt. 

Something’s gotta give. 

11 days in and withdrawal symptoms are starting to flare: Sluggish. Exhausted. Brain fog. Mixing up words. 

My mouth is not happy right now either. 

In particular, my teeth and gums feel really weird — not sore, but kind of dry or sensitive, it’s hard to explain — I can feel my gums all the time and aware of their presence in a way that I hadn’t before, if that makes sense. 

Saliva feels thick when i swallow. Inside of my cheeks feel a little raw and patchy. And there’s also a sensation of a small bump on the floor of my mouth, under the tongue, almost like there’s a little irritant seed or crumb stuck there that won’t go away, like a piece of gritty dirt in an oyster. I keep feeling around for the thing but can’t locate it — driving me crazy! 

I just visited the dentist last week and I did have a pretty medium sized cavity — which we promptly fixed — but nothing else. They examined my gums and tongue and under tongue and didn’t remark on anything... however I also haven’t told them about smoking so not sure if there are deeper tissue examinations that they might do to uncover any bad things happening at an early stage. 

Hopefully these symptoms will pass over the coming days/weeks. If anyone has experienced something similar, would appreciate any advice.

Until then, just trying to get through one day at a time. 

Just trying to make it to Day 12.",4

Mainly I plan my days, I have a life plans and simply I do not have much time. When I smoke and day after wake up tired at noon I am just not happy. When I eat everything in fridge and needs to go buy breakfast second day instead of using something bought yesterday - it is just not comfortable.

2019-11-11 13:23:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/duwglr/my_experience_with_quitting_weed_for_good_now_6/,My experience with quitting weed for good. Now 6 years sober.,"I smoked cannabis every day for 4 years and it controlled my life. If I were going somewhere, i'd have to ask if there's anywhere I can smoke up. Trips abroad were out of the question, I wasn't risking smuggling stuff onto the plane or trying to find a dealer in a foreign place.

A few hours without weed and I was a mess. Well, more than a mess than usual. I felt unbelievable anger, would have violent outburst and even end up crying. Even the friends I had at the time were only really my friends because we all smoked weed. We all shared our stuff, and it's really the only thing we had in common. In fact, it was the only thing I had to say about myself... ""I smoke weed"". I could had never imagined my life without it.

After years of smoking and the anxiety that it gave me, it took ""hitting white"" pretty bad to finally make me stop. It was difficult, but I couldn't even smell the stuff without being reminded of tripping balls and having a massive panic attack in the dirty flat of my stoner friends. So I quit.

I still visited my ""friends"" who all scoffed at the idea of me quitting. They even got me to smoke a few times more after that. But I began feeling better as a person and saw that they acted exactly how I did when I smoked... Miserable, bitching about other people, talking about how anyone who drinks and doesn't smoke is an idiot, generally just being terrible human beings. So I quit them too.

Quitting them was probably the hardest part. They didn't take it lightly, and to this day they still talk a lot of shit about me *(which I only know through mutual acquaintances, i never engage with them)* but I know it's because they're still stuck in the loop of waking up every day with only weed in mind. They're still as miserable as I was.

I didn't have any friends for a while after that. I felt just as numb as I did when I smoked daily, except this time I was alone. I had a lot more money but was still experiencing extreme social anxiety, had a complete lack of motivation, along with the withdrawal... Extreme nightmares, troubling eating and sleeping, headaches that lasted weeks... The list goes on.

It all changed when I went to a festival that I usually frequented with my stoner buddies, except this time I had nobody to camp with. A lot of bands I liked were playing, so in a last ditch attempt I set out to find someone, anyone, I can spend the festival with so my scorned ex-friends didn't have to see me pathetically wander the grounds alone. I facebook searched ""*festival name* alone"" and bam, ""*festival name* Newbies & Loners group"" came up.

So I joined these guys from the group to camp with for the festival, and it was practically a camp of people who all came alone along with a bunch of veterans who organise it. I came out of my shell so much that weekend, and I met so many people who I would now proudly call some of my best friends. In fact, next October i'll be one of the bridesmaids for a woman I met at that very camp 5 years ago.

Looking back, quitting weed was the best thing I ever did. I now have friendships that I can truly be proud of, I have hobbies, I **shower,** I have the sleeping pattern of a normal human and most importantly I found out that I have an actual personality. If you ask my friends what I was like in person, they'd probably tell you that I'm very outgoing, bubbly and a bit of a goofball... The complete opposite to how I was before. 

Social anxiety is a thing of the past now, it was seriously just the weed which was causing it... Although for a while I was convinced that was just the way I am. Last year I also reconnected with one of my old stoner buddies who was actually the only nice one of the group, and he's quit too. He said I seem like a completely different person now, in a good way. And we're now really good friends.

It took me around 2 years to feel ""normal"" again, but it was so worth it. And every blue moon, when the time and environment is just right, i'll take a toke or two of a joint and **I actually enjoy it.** No anxiety, no feelings of dread, just intense giggles shared with a trusted friend.

I may not have a perfect life, or still not a lot of money, but I feel like I'm finally a normal, happy person.",182

2019-11-11 10:58:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/duub2e/need_to_get_back_on_the_wagon/,Need to get back on the wagon,"I made it almost 90 days this summer weed-free (and it wasn't easy) and the withdrawal symptoms had almost subsided when I temporarily moved in with my best friend who is a daily wake-and-bake smoker.  Needless to say, there went my quit.  Now a couple of months have gone by, I've moved across the country to a new city, and at this point, weed is affecting me far more negatively than positively.  I really need to get back on the wagon because right now, weed is the big thing making adjustment to this move more difficult.  Rather than going out and meeting new people, exploring the city, taking up hobbies, and doing whatever else that may actually be fulfilling, I pretty much get off work, light up, and just bake until I fall asleep.  The next day it's wash, rinse, and repeat, and since I really don't have many friends here I'm getting increasingly lonely.  I also find that weed actually increases my social anxiety whenever I'm not high compared to how it would otherwise be as a non-smoker.

There's one problem though, I have a ""weed-cation"" with my best friend planned over Thanksgiving and I really don't want to back out of that.  However, I'm thinking of making that my last big hurrah.  I keep going back and forth on whether or not I should stop smoking now or wait until after Thanksgiving week.  I could also stop now and let myself smoke again Thanksgiving week and then stop again permanently afterwards, though if I do that, stopping may be more difficult.

Right now, my biggest issue is just making it through that first day without smoking.  I always wake up gung ho that today is going to be the day, but by the end of the night I can't stop myself from lighting up.  Another thing is that I currently only smoke a bowl per day on a typical day.  Prior to my last quit I was a wake-and-bake smoker.  While I personally don't think there's much wrong with a bowl per day, my issue is that it plays far too important of a role in my life.  I find myself just sitting on my patio smoking when I could be doing something else that's more constructive with my life and it's something that I really need to change.",1

In that time I have been long term unemployed, self-employed, fully employed and went back to school in 2012. Somehow I managed to get into and graduate from University of Cambridge as a mature student in 2016 (I'm 43 now) all whilst battling with weed. 

I've struggled with mental health issues all my life after traumatic experiences and being severely ill as a child and smoking for a long time was absolutely the answer to the misery of life. When I went back to school I noticed the problems that weed was causing for me and began to suspect it wasn't all roses and cream teas in the herb garden. I landed strong academic roles after graduation and produced a couple of important academic papers but the need to be constantly 'on it' and working at a high pressure level took its toll and I experienced a breakdown about 2 years ago, in the middle of postgrad studies and research work.

I've spent the last 18 months slowly getting back into work and started an office role 12 months ago at my old community college but carried on smoking. It got to the point where I accepted that  weed is causing me as many problems as it is solving so on the week beginning 25th October I cut my smoking down and on 1st November I smoked my last joint, went to bed and woke up in a panic attack. 

That has basically been the routine of the last 9 days, fighting against panic and anxiety with a sense of pride at knocking weed and tobacco on the head. I haven't moved over to alcohol and have even cut out caffeine, replacing it with rooibos tea. But everyday is an emotional rollercoaster and it's much harder stopping this time than I can ever recall. 

There's no chance of me smoking again but the emotional weight is driving me out of my mind with constant stress headaches, nausea, dizziness and cycles of anger-sadness-self-pity. 

I'm officially homeless as I've been sleeping on my ex's couch for the best part of 12 months and in debt with an income that can't dog me out of the shit. I'm constantly applying for full-time work but I can't function at a high level so am applying for jobs that I am overqualified for but really would be happy to do. I am having zero success and even less if I explain my issue with mental health beforehand. 

Phew! So that is where I am. It is day 9 since stopping and I am writing this whilst on hold to a homelessness advice line. The REASON I am writing this is to say THANK YOU! Thank you so much to everyone on this thread, you have literally saved my life over the last 9 days and I have cried and laughed with all the posts you are making and the solidarity you all show to each other. The world needs so much more of this at the moment and I for one am so grateful that this well of support exists. You are all my elixir of hope and I wish you all nothing but health and success.  Every minute that passed that you don't smoke is a victory. I kno what you are all going through and every single one of you are absolute heroes, every single minute. 

So thank you, may your God bless you and if you don't have one, for what it's worth, this short hairy middle aged guy (Gen X!) from the middle of the UK is keeping you all in his thoughts. Thanks again xxx",14

I went to the woods this weekend and was surprised that my cravings weren’t too terribly bad, and the withdrawals were very mild. (Special thanks to this sub for great suggestions on on what to pack). Got home last night. 
Then I woke up this morning at home and BAM! I’m nauseous, anxious, depressed, and am shaking SO BADLY i can hardly type this. I’m sure a lot of it has to do with being back in “real life”
I took some anti anxiety meds, planning to meditate and do some yoga. 
Mainly just posting this for some accountability. I CANNOT smoke today. 

How is everyone else hanging in?",17

I spent a couple days at the inlaws so being away helped me get through the first stint. Im now home and im worried once i feel better (i am sick) i will go back to smoking. I'm 24 and I've smoked daily since I was 14 and I started prioritising it at about 16. I've lost most of my vocabulary, my singing voice and I feel I've wasted some of the best years of my life trying to figure out how I'm going to buy weed that day. 

Never been good with money so i wasnt the type to have weed and always have it. I was the type to finish the bag as soon as possible regardless of how big it was or how long it had to last. After every spliff i would promise not to smoke after this bag then 45 minutes later i found myself skinning up again. 

I think what im trying to say is. Even if  it is your biggest vice. And even if your like me and you have followed this thread for years idolizing the people who post recovery milestones. You have a chance at life again and regardless of how hard you think it will be, it wont be as hard as living with addiction for the rest of your life.",1

2019-11-10 20:55:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dula88/need_some_support_advice_moving_forward/,Need Some Support/ Advice Moving Forward,"Hey All, I've been lurking on this sub for the last week or so now, figured it was time I should finally post, especially since it's appropriate with my current situation.

Today is my 17th consecutive day without getting high, and this is the longest I've gone without it in the last 2 years. I was a casual smoker all through high school, but towards the end of my senior year I became a daily smoker. By the time I began my freshman year of college, I was smoking multiple times every day. I attend a highly selective liberal arts school where most of the students are functioning drugs addicts (either weed/alcohol/psychs/you name it) so I fit right in. At first I smoked mostly for fun and to 'relax,' but before I knew it I began smoking to deal with the emotion issues I was facing. (Side note- I've been dealing with depression since the beginning of high school and have been on and off of zolaft since) Around this time I started to develop intense social anxiety, to a point where I dreaded being around any other human beings and would rather just sit alone in my room and get high than do anything else. Nonetheless, I was not open to the idea of stopping my smoking habits, I also felt I was so incapable of stopping that something terrible may happen if I did.

Flash forward to this year (my sophomore year), and I started it out by smoking myself into nothingness, bong rips at least once an hour from noon through the time I went to sleep, and eventually evolving to staying high every waking second of every day. I began to feel so intensely miserable and anxious, and I knew that something needed to change and I had to get out of my current situation. At this point, my anxiety got so terrible that unless I smoked right after waking up, I'd puke my brains out. 

So I ended up where I am now, in Chicago, taking a class here for a few weeks. This has been the greatest thing that has  happened to me in forever. I was able to remove myself from a seemingly toxic environment, and it actually made stopping smoking bearable. I still had a pretty nasty withdrawal with panic attacks and major insomnia, but I feel now at just over two weeks I am through the worst and have only been improving. I've felt my crippling anxiety slowly trickling away, and I feel I can see things clearer, like color has returned to the world. I still have my bad days don't get me wrong, but things are much better than they have been.

However, I go back to my school in 3 days. For the entirety of my time there, I've been getting high every day. All my friends are stoners, and it's in a legal state so it feels like kush is practically everywhere. I am so incredibly anxious about falling back into old habits. I have had urges to get high while Ive been away, but not having it accessible has made that far easier. I also live with a room mate who gets high everyday, and I don't know how to confront him about this change I've made/ am trying to continue. He is my best friend and is incredibly supportive of me, and he knows I am trying to stop, but I doubt he will consider cutting back/stopping anytime soon.

At this point, I think it's safe to say I've figured out that recreational marijuana use is not a positive force in my life and it is best to just cut it out completely. Without it I feel considerably better, like I have a purpose and life is worth living. I'm posting here because I want to know if anybody has had a similar experience to mine, and also because I need advice moving forward. I could really use some strategies of how to approach re-integrating into my old school environment without falling back into constant smoking. I also could use some new strategies to deal with cravings, because they most definitely have not stopped. 

If you made it this far thanks for reading, much love to all of you :)",3

2019-11-10 20:25:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dukwmi/what_happened/,What happened?,"Hi Leaves, this might be kind of long but I'm confused as to what happened to me and why there was a sudden ""flip"" in my head after what I went through. I'll try to make this as neat as possible, sorry if I mess up anywhere.

**Brief background**: **22 years old, was eating 10mg edibles 2x weekly for 4 months (started 1st week of June 2019-ended 1st week of October 2019)**

Occasionally taking two 20mg at a time, maybe 3 times I did this and sometimes 1 edible with a Rockstar, did this like 4 times. I also got a vape pen + 1 cartridge of weed oil on my fourth / final month and finished that in 1 month?  vaping up to 4x weekly.

**Mental health & Drug history**

I've been socially anxious since I was about 8 years old, due to sexual abuse I suffered at around that age. I was depressed and socially anxious throughout my teens but got a lot better after I turned 20. The social anxiety was mostly insecurity about my appearance and weight, but once I felt comfortable with the person or people, I'd be okay.

**Drug history**

I used Xanax for 1 week according to instructions when I was 18 for a test that I was uber anxious about, I didn't know much about it, just that it would take away anxiety. When I was done with the prescription I felt like I was freakin dying and decided to never use them again.

At 19 I abused a prescription of Oxycodone after getting my wisdom teeth taken out, this was also a period where I was ultra emotionally vulnerable / going through a bad time in my life. This lasted around 2 weeks during which I was like Gollum & The Ring so to speak. I also got my grubby hands on my dad's oxy pills and finished them all which was 1 prescription (he's not addicted, they prescribed them for a work accident but he never took them cause he said they weren't good) After I ran out I was desperate for them but since I couldn't get any I gave up and the withdrawals eventually passed.

That's pretty much it.. other than starting weed at 22. After this my family and I went through an intense period of healing and communication, (after a rough upbringing, lots of abuse)  which from then on I'd say I was pretty content in life.

**Why did I start using weed?**

**100% honest** I looked at my driver's license and reminded myself that I'm 22. Hey I can buy weed now! (could've done it a year ago but never paid much attention to it) I was really curious about what it felt like to be high.

**Quitting**

At the start of October, I decided to no longer use weed since I didn't like how it would make me feel afterwards, groggy, lazy, slow, dreamy. I also wasn't getting as high as before and didn't like the idea of increasing the amount of MGs to get higher. I was also going to move out soon and was trying to be my best / healthiest self. The overeating bc of munchies would make me feel especially guilty since I've struggled with my weight most of my life.

I gave away all my edibles and I felt like I was doing pretty well at this period, happy cause I was moving out and all that.

Well one night I decided to take one ""last"" edible, mostly cause my hand was hurting like hell, I have carpal tunnel and ibuprofen doesn't help at all. This edible wasn't mine, it belonged to a relative that left it with me while she went on vacation for a few months. We would share edibles before and I didn't think much of it.

After an hour it started to kick in which I thought was a little weird since it usually takes 2 for me, and I ate before I took it.. hmm. I'm texting a friend when all of a sudden I lose my reading ability, I'm seeing the words, but it's not registering which spooks me. I worry a bit and try to calm myself, telling myself its just the weed. Well that didn't work lol. I felt myself getting higher and higher, more panic each second, I was having a full blown panic attack and it truly felt like I was losing my mind. I'd never felt anything like it, I was uber paranoid, thought everyone was out to get me, it's like the fear part of my brain was on overdrive. At one point I actually wanted to kill myself just to make it stop. That was also the first time I've ever experienced a panic attack.

Yeah, it was really bad, right now I can kind of laugh at how bad I was freaking out, but at the time it wasn't funny at all.

Since then I have some of these symptoms everyday, it's been 36 days. I made a list of symptoms I've experienced and timelines.

What has me confused is why I've been feeling all this since the panic attack that night, before, I did notice ""light"" withdrawal symptoms?

Notably

Physically:

* Nausea / gut issues
* Mild headaches & loss of appetite

Emotionally

* Unable to deal with stressful situations (whereas before weed I would consider myself a rock, stress was nonexistent)
* Irritability and anger
* Disturbing nightmares and random spikes of anxiety that would last a few seconds

&#x200B;

These are all I can think of right now before the panic attack happened, and they were super mild. I would barely notice these at all. If I remember any more I'll edit.

&#x200B;

After the panic attack everything turned upside down

&#x200B;

**Day 1-14**

Emotionally:

* Void feeling inside me / DPDR
* Panic attacks only happened during the first 4 days and they weren't as bad as the first one
* Ongoing General Anxiety through out day
* Fear of the night since that's when it happened
* Fear of **everything**, sounds, videos, games, **literally everything, even my cats.**
* Shattered sense of self, felt like I broke my personality / everything about myself
* Sadness and regret
* Irritability at anything
* Fear of getting another panic attack / getting triggered at reminders
* Extremely vivid / highly emotional and disturbing nightmares
* WILD WILD Mood swings
* Intrusive thoughts / thoughts of my family being violently hurt or killed
* Extreme Paranoia / belief that my family wanted to hurt me. I'd try to shake these thoughts off
* Emotional Sensitivity, crying easily, in general just feeling everything more intensely
* Manic highs / Pink Cloud Syndrome?
* Hearing sounds / conversations right before falling asleep for example, sound of metal clashing, cat meow, or popping sounds.
* Taking everything as a personal attack

Physically

* Day after panic attack, KILLER migraine, felt like my head got bashed. Literally could not get out of bed
* Sweaty hands, bad smell coming from them despite washing hands multiple times daily, smell of iron or metal.
* Cold chills through out body, especially back of head and neck / shoulders arms
* Sweating through out the night and sleep, so much I had to have spare clothes and bed sheets
* Fast heart beat
* Dry and heavy eyes
* Extreme fatigue
* Intense nausea, not being able to hold food or only eating less than 700 calories per day
* Shaking
* Dizziness & lightheaded
* Headaches

Day 14-21

* Anxiety can change from very mild through out the day, to bad. Usually due to triggers or thinking I'm not going to get better. Overall the anxiety wasn't just random, it was caused by thinking about the actual anxiety and certain triggers / reminders of the panic attack
* Mood swings
* Same symptoms as above but reduced by 70%

**After Day 25** things start to get a little better, I still deal with some issues above, mostly

* Fatigue and DPDR
* Mild anxiety and mood swings
* Depression that comes and goes
* Some intrusive thoughts
* I've only slept well 2 nights out of 36 days, I fall asleep easily unless I panicked that night which has only happened maybe 5 times. I constantly wake up through out the night, at least 4 times and every time I wake up I have very mild anxiety.
* Over analyzing and frustration at having to go through this.

**Things I'm doing to feel better**

* Reading here and reading everyone's experiences brings me a lot of comfort knowing that I'm not the only one going through this.
* Sleep hygiene
* Exercise & healthy diet, I've stopped all cannabis use since the panic attack 36 days ago, no caffeine and limiting sugar
* Fish oil pills
* Socializing and doing things I enjoy like cooking
* Talking with my family about what I'm going through
* I've started therapy and am being completely honest with everything, in fact I will probably show them all of this.

&#x200B;

I'm mostly left wondering why or how the edible induced panic attack could've caused all the symptoms above, the intrusive thoughts are especially scary since I've never had them EVER before. Is this withdrawal or something else? I've talked with my doctor and she told me I'd most likely get better with time but is a bit unsure since they (doctors) don't know much about cannabis currently. (her words.)

I don't plan to ever use weed again, the panic attack was pretty terrifying and made me take mental health way more seriously... if you've taken the time to read all of this, thank you. I will update at 2 months and so forth.",8

The lack of sleep. The irritability. I knew it was going to be tough. I suppose I didn’t realize it was going to be this tough.  

It’s not the cravings. I’m honestly a little surprise I don’t feel the need to use. Which is kind of nice. 

This is the longest stretch in about 6 years that I haven’t used. I’ve been a daily user for years. On 1 vacation in 6 years is the only other time I’ve gone more than a few hours without using. Not by choice, but was visiting a state that wouldn’t allow it.  

This time started similar. I was over seas for about 2 weeks, visiting countries where it was illegal. I didn’t really miss it, but maybe that was because it was a beer tourism trip, and I drank quite a bit. And I rarely drink.  

When I got back home to my very tolerant state. I knew it was time to cash it in. The first few days home were incredibly easy; I was super jet lagged and my body was on a different clock. Sleep wasn’t a problem.  

More than 2 weeks home, and it’s been setting in hard. Maybe 3 hours of sleep in the last 3 days. Maybe. I’m short and irritable with my kids and wife. I don’t have much motivation to do anything. 

I don’t feel the need to use. I have a good support system in place. I will succeed. It’s going to be a long road, I am sure. But I will do this.",10

2019-11-10 13:04:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/duety8/officially_on_day_1_again/,"Officially on day 1, again.","Two years ago I quit smoking for around 6 months. I got to the point where I hated smoking, hated spending money on it, and hated being high. At that point I had been a daily smoker for 6 years, and the last year I was self medicating for anxiety. After my relapse I started smoking everyday almost instantly, and again, got to the point where I hate all of it. 

I'm excited for my sober life but fuck I hate the withdrawls. The last two weeks I've limited myself to only a couple puffs of my pen a few hours before bed so I'm a little surprised my symptoms are so bad. Especially since the last week I didn't feel like I was getting high, it seemed like I was putting chemicals from the vape in my body instead of actual THC. Friday night I could tell it was empty, and yesterday I had the worst sweats. I made the stupid mistake of having preworkout at 3pm, an energy drink at 7pm, and two vodka red bulls at the bar, so trying to sleep was terrible. I tossed and turned all night, and when I did sleep I had terrible dreams about my girlfriend (we got in a disagreement earlier in the day so it was definitely my subconscious working through everything). Again I sweat, but was simultaneously freezing. I woke up today feeling like death even though I chugged a bottle of water and took some ibuprofen before bed to offset the alcohol I had earlier.

I'm supposed to see my girlfriend today but I honestly want to curl up in a ball and lie on the couch. I feel so clammy and gross but I know doing nothing all day won't help me sleep any better tonight. 

But it's going to be worth it. I've already seen the positive effects. My bank account is thriving, I felt more clear headed not smoking throughout the day. And the first step is always the hardest. 

So happy Sober Sunday everyone. Keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I try to make it through this afternoon and evening.",3

2019-11-10 10:26:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ducrt4/wow_i_didnt_even_realize/,Wow... I didn't even realize.,"I was not even aware until now how much my habit was keeping me from living a content, productive, even lifestyle. I'm turning 22 a week from now, and I started when I was 17.

Basically I'm now recognizing the reality of how much cannabis has set me back in these formative years. I'm only on day 4 of sobriety now but it feels like it has been ages. I'm stricken with the sensation now that there is no way I will ever go back to it after realizing what it has made me OK with.

I could have had more of a decent shot at getting into a university, finding scholarships, looking for a relationship and not being so inward that I can't talk to new people, and preventing the dissapointment from my family and exposure of the habit to the younger people in my family. The last time I went sober was when I got caught with a gram by the police at 19. I was in my vehicle at the time, and could have easily been stricken with a DUI, but instead was on a mild parole for a year and a half.

I pursued music very seriously for a couple years because of course I felt that cannabis was inspiring me, that I it helped make my misic better, but now I realize I'm not really good enough to make money from it. Maybe.. Its hard to say now. The point is, I moved out od state to Eugene, OR on the pretense of finding a part time no support my artistic passions and working on my album, but at a certain point my smoking got so bad I was relaxing instead of putting in the hard work every evening to get there. 

Yesterdjay I went busking at Saturday Market and made $1, then subsequently my string broke. At least I can afford to replace it. I didn't even want to go but I felt it was the only way I maybe could make some quick cash. Because of my part time work, I am now over $500 in debt and I have $15 left so I am trying my hardest not to buy food when I don't have to. 

I now understand the dark side of drug addiction, and why there's so many homeless people on the street who will put up with the most ridiculous and dehumanizing of conditions just so they can get a fix because after all, the drug makes whatever condition you're in more acceptable.

I am starting to crave more of a challenge in my life. I realize how much I need money, I need to obtain skills, I want to find a partner. In so lonely and so many of these things Im going through just need to be expressed for me to experience a semblance of sanity and humanity. 

Pleasure is a trap. I noticed the same thing with food when I lost 85 lbs. I've been lying to myself for so long about what the answer to a fufilled life is. It's Definately not hedonism, which will get you nowhere.it's service and love and repect and virtues and all these things I have to relearn in order to climb myself out of this hole I've created for myself. 

The good news is, now that Im sobering, I feel like I am wicked wizard level intelligent and I can accomplish anything and start creating value and changing. And I'm also glad that I now have a story to tell on the real reasons why you shouldn't use drugs. Thanks for reading.",6

I have a good job, great family. No one knows I have an issue but me. I'm very subtle about my usage, and recently getting my card has created a tolerance of my increased usage from my wife.

I'm stoned basically all weekend. Can't wait to get home from work and get stoned.

No one is even bothered by me using cannabis but me. It consumes me, I'm constantly spending money on it. Trying new strains. Thanks to my ability to legally obtain it I'm constantly stocking up when I don't need to. Then smoking it all because ""well, I have a bunch may as well get REALLY ripped.""

I’ve been smoking 6 years straight everyday all day, a ridiculous amount you’d only laugh about, waking up in the night to roll over and do it, first thing in the morning, first thing after work. First thing before eating, going to the toilet and almost damn near everything.
I’ve been stagnant for 6 years, I’ve done a lot over that time and had many experiences and journeys and haven’t necessarily missed out on anything, but I feel like I could do better. I feel I could’ve been a hell of a lot further in life if that were to be a priority over smoking weed.
I can’t say I hate it but I hate the way I abuse it and it has control over me. What if I have control, is that enough? Or do I need it gone completely?

Friday I caught up with a close friend who has gone through a series of events in the past couple years that have changed him significantly for the better. I opened up to him about my concerns and laid everything out on the table. There were many things discussed and realisations made. I went home and it was not the first thing I did when I got home. I had two that night, in comparison to what could have easily been 30-50 hits from the bong. Saturday I had none, I had friends smoke around me but I was able to have control and make that decision not to give in cause I know I can better myself if it isn’t a priority.

Would enjoying it as a treat at the end of the day of not doing it every second be okay? Considering the position I was in, to the acknowledgement of abuse and newfound reasoning for not smoking, do you think i will still improve doing this or do I need to kick it?

Can not remove myself from environment it’s contained in but can gain control.",3

I’ve been too cowardly so far to commit. “I’ll take a break after this cartridge runs out,” I tell myself. “I’ll stop for just a couple weeks, just to recharge.” Or, the deadliest one: “I have nothing to do tonight anyway, it’s not like I’m missing out on anything.”

These are weak things to say. I know I need to stop, I KNOW it, yet I give myself excuses every time. This means I’m being dishonest to myself at best or abusive to myself at worst.

I need to use firmer language. It’s not “taking a break”, it’s quitting. It’s not “getting back into it”, it’s relapsing. Nights where I choose to get stoned and play the same video games I’ve been playing since 2012 instead of call my family or read a book or get dinner with a friend are **wasted nights**. They’re zero-nights. They seal me off from the world around me and dump my precious, irrecoverable time down the drain.

I feel weak and ashamed when I go to bed high, and I feel strong and proud when I resist the temptation. Is that not enough incentive for me to quit?

Pain is a great thing because it tells us what we need to stop doing. Would I continue to hold my hand against a stovetop after I felt that it was hot? **NO.** So why do I continue to do things that make me feel weak?

I’m done hiding my shame and letting it poison my happiness. I’ll wear my shame like armor, use it like a map, let it point me toward decisions that make me feel strong and proud.

I am addicted to weed, and I am ashamed of it. Enough self-pity. Straighten up.",241

2019-11-09 19:10:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/du42rp/life_with_stoner_roommate/,Life with Stoner Roommate,"At first, it was so hard. I fell off the wagon so many times not BECAUSE of her necessarily, but because it was so easy to give in to the urge to smoke when the person living in the next room is constantly baking, several times a day. Then I went through cycles where I'd blame her, but really, at the end of the day, addiction is a personal battle.  


It's been challenging, too, because this is the friend that I used to smoke weed with. Like, that's what we did. She was the first person I ever got drunk with, the first person I smoked out with my high school stash, first person I ever tripped acid with and did shrooms with. Since I've been serious about quitting weed (which has been a 6-month long process), it's put a big strain on our friendship. And al the times I've relapsed, she's presented a pipe to me on a silver goddamn platter, as if she was happy to see me tumble back down into the depths off this very real addiction, even though she saw how much I struggled with it.  


Not that that's her problem, though. I've been coming to terms with it, and I've eventually learned it's a boundary to cross when you do someone else's inventory. It's her journey... and I have to let her go.   


But I'll be honest, it breaks my heart to see my friend drugging every day, and now drinking more. Like, finding-jumbo-vodka-bottles-hidden-under-the-sink levels of secretive boozing, after confessions from her that she can't keep hard alcohol in the house because she can't control herself around it. Taking out the recycling and seeing a surprising number of beer bottles that were consumed secretly and alone levels of consumption. Bottles of wine drunk in a day... a jumbo handle of vodka gifted to me as a housewarming gift that I never touched entirely gone.  


It sucks to see.   


I not only hate seeing her like this just on principle, but she's lashed out at me in states of drunkenness and low-level fucked-upness that I'm also learning to not take personally. I'm keeping my distance, but also learning how to be friendly and non-judgmental. Nonetheless,  it doesn't matter that she pays bills sort of on-time (rent was a week late last month, which made me nervous-- not because she didn't pay it, but because she went on vacation and didn't square it away beforehand); it still affects my energy field, because it's just... sad.  


What's the next step? I'm realizing I can't live here forever, but I'm a freelance teacher and musician in NYC and my fiances aren't in a place where I could feasibly move at the moment. But I figure that will all take care of itself as I continue building this incredible life for myself in sobriety. The energy and positivity I have is remarkable, and I'm so grateful for this gift. Easily one of the best decisions I've ever made.   


I'm almost a month off weed (25 days!!) and feel like a new woman. AA and NA have helped tremendously-- they've made all the difference, because there's accountability. Before, I'd relapse easily because who the fuck knew or ""cared"", anyway... but now that I'm in a community of people that actively cultivate their sobriety, I feel welcome, understood, and incentivized to keep at it, one day at a time.   


Sending vibes to my friend, and to everyone else mired in this deep shit.",4

I was sitting there, watching Breaking Bad, having a glass of wine. I was so tempted to get some weed and roll one up, and I had 99% decided in my head that I was going to do it. Then, I remembered how down on myself I've felt in the past when I caved and broke a streak of not smoking.

Then it hit me - I realized all I had to do was sit there and wait it out. This was one of the few times in my life where being lazy would pay off. In order to do the best thing for myself, all I had to do was literally nothing.

Daily smoker for 20 years, 38/f. Wondering if I'm just resigned to being a pothead for life. I don't really want to be, but I'm also not sure I want the life I have now. 

The stories I want to change are: 

\- I'm less motivated when I'm sober. I feel like a slug - no motivation to meditate, exercise. I used to do these things high. Now I pass out in front of the tv. (tbh I did that high as well). 

\- Instead of getting up at 5am, wake and back and reflect, sit with introspection, I now sleep in till right before I need to get to work. I do have wild dreams during this time that I like to reflect on. I think I've always gotten most of my REM sleep during these hours, which has always made me late for school/work. I tell myself that I'd rather have conscious introspection than unconscious sorting out of what may or may not be relevant. 

\- I feel like I'm socially boring now...nothing new or interesting to say. When I was stoned, I was indeed anxious about people knowing, but I feel like I'm just a dud now. Pot opened my mind, made me enjoy and believe in my thoughts. 

\-  I feel some type of resistance to problem solving and ideating. Like it's all hopeless. I procrastinate on taking action in my business because I believe pot gave me the courage and insight to do so. 

\- I run a business and work stupid hours. I have to cover on my one day off tomorrow (also the day I've been meditating, going to church and going to my MA meeting, none of which I'll have time to do). I don't know how to grab that little sense of relief when I have to work all the time. 

\- I'm just not liking myself very much these days. I feel boring and sluggish. I feel like a bad leader, a bad activist. Pot gave me this burst of confidence. Like I can do all these things because pot opened my mind up enough to do them. 

\- I'm still obsessed with weed. I read r/leaves constantly, but I also read all the pot boards and googling it all the time. I think about it constantly. 

\--

There are a few benefits to quitting, and I want to be honest about those: 

\- my throat doesn't hurt! My voice is still jacked up a little, but my throat is not sore when I swallow. 

\- I'm not worried about being caught

\- I'm less worried about getting some kind of major health consequence, cancer or emphysema, which would ""out"" me as a pothead. 

\- I don't need to worry about my kids finding it, catching me in the act, again, don't need to worry about having a big secret. 

Ugh it feels good to unload that. I'm going to print this out and work on rewriting these stories, because as my therapist says, thoughts create actions, and I keep having these thoughts.",5

Mary Jane just isn't kind to me anymore.

This life is tough enough. Hiding from it just makes it worse. Nothing will ever get better if these last two days becomes the template for how I live.

&#x200B;

Im 62 days clean from pot. This is what has happened:

\- My overall anxiety has dropped a noticeable amount 

\- I can hold eye contact with people

\- I no longer fell awkward in certain social situations, I actually enjoy them

\- Im feeling healthier overall, thanks to the gym and my diet

&#x200B;

I took me about 30-40 days to fully recover from withdrawals. The worst part for me was the irritation. I was in such a bad mood all the time! I hated it, and so did everyone around me. 

So now Im feeling normal again and i like it. But despite all of that, I almost relapsed yesterday.

&#x200B;

I had the flu and that was my trigger. The old me used to be high out of my mind every time i was sick. It was a great excuse for me to get high: no work, no need to see any friends or family. Just me, weed and the couch. Now that i think of it, it really sounds pathetic. But still, i have some really strong emotional memories that connect weed to flu.

&#x200B;

And so it happens, i had one dose of cannabutter in my freezer. I found it by accident when i was looking for something to eat yesterday. I got super excited first. Hell yeah! Lets chill! So I started warming up some milk for a cannabis cocoa. As the milk was getting hot on the stove i started to think. Is this really worth it? What the fuck am i doing here? The thing is, I finally feel normal. Im free from the fucking pot! And here i am, cooking up some leftover weed from my freezer. I should be resting and drinking tea. 

The milk saved me. If it was a joint, i would have just straight outta puffed that mofo. Now i had time to think. Needless to say, i threw that cannabutter straigh in to trash.

I guess my point is: stay strong and vigilante! Sending good vibes to yall.",29

I feel like I’m stuck in an endless cycle.

I went to the doctor for the pain, and told her during the appointment that I was depressed about the end of my relationship and that I’ve been addicted to cannabis for over 3 years and am trying to quit. She referred me to a psychiatrist who handles addiction, but I emailed the psychiatrist and she still hasn’t gotten back to me and it’s been 3 days now. I reached out to a therapist and plan on getting an appointment as soon as possible because I really need someone objective to talk to who is licensed. I have experience with CBT and it’s helped me greatly.

My question is, what mental games can I play to help me get through this. I will not meditate. I have a lot of experience with meditation and was in a meditation group throughout college. Nonetheless, I refuse to practice meditation because I‘m strongly against Stoicism and all ideologies and philosophies that echo its mantra in anyway—even if I recognize that Stoicism helps people in many ways. I’d argue that it helps people the way weed does, with a multitude of bad side effects. Thanks again.",5

I am reaching out, just like you. I would share a little more about my story, but I have a feeling that it is a familiar one here. So I can relax I think, step back from the pressure of ‘quitting’. Instead I can be assured that there are a few thousand people around the country/world who would if they could pat my back, and help me through this. Because I would do the same thing for them. 
I am in the middle of a nontraditional attempt at a BS in Psychology with a minor in Family Health and Disability. My son turns 1 tomorrow. The last year has been rough, but I can say the the frequency of my habitual pot smoking is still trending down. The truth is my frequency will never be zero, but it it can hug the axis as well as it can. Today could be the day I stop “for good” not because I think I should.  

Here is a quote I hope is helpful for someone

 A failure is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying.

You would think that after quitting 6+ times (up to 6 months at a time) that I would have 'figured it out' and 'learned my lesson'....

NOPE!

I often ask myself, is it possible that I can quit this plant for good?  I truly do not know.  I want to, but it always creeps back into my life.

I have been a heavy user, on and off, for about 18 years.  At times vaping from 10AM till 10PM.
The first month or two of using (after a break/attempt to quit) are fun - you remember why you loved this plant.  Then it becomes almost a chore....a daily grind, and an exhausting one at that.
For me it was becoming too consuming and I chose to quit.  

I also believe (and have ready a lot of new studies to support this) that it (especially Sativas) triggers my anxiety, big time.  It also has created some depression, I think.
So, here I am - once again, about day 4 now and while the symptoms are OK - very irritable, some stomach issues, etc. 

My fear is this....

2-3+ months from now, I will yearn for something to 'relax' with, to take the edge off after a long day.  I do not drink (that stuff is toxic) and I would always tend to revert to the green stuff to do so.  But my personality does not allow me to do it in moderation - I try to tell myself that, but it slowly but surely reverts back to a daily cycle and becomes consuming.

I am mad at myself that I have not learned my lesson.  I am 36 for heavens sake.  I own my own business, have a fairly good head on my shoulders - so how could I be so foolish?  Talk about a love/hate relationship.

To those who have been in similar situations - how do you stay off of it for good!?  What has helped you 'take the edge off' after one of those long stressful days?  What do you use to just relax/unwind with?

Thank you all for letting me vent - just typing this up is cathartic.",3

The roof in our home is starting to leak. I've noticed since I'm not stoned 24/7 i can deal with things straight away with a clear mind. Like calling roofers for quotes etc. 

I also don't fear people coming over to the house and smelling weed. I'm just much more free to live a normal life off of the weed. 

I also have a little bit of money to buy stuff, like a new pair of track bottoms for  £10.50, i used to spend every spare penny on weed and alcohol.

I kept waiting for it to happen again this round, but it was pretty smooth sailing. I've had done mood swings (both sad/angry and happy- has anyone experienced the happy side? I haven't seen it talked about), some light headaches and fatigue, but that's about it.

I’ve heard that celebrating a positive event can be a trigger for some people, and it sort of seems like that’s what’s happening to me right now. I am looking forward to topping off a good day with (more than) a few puffs.

I also read the announcement today that the CDC found the issue with carts is very likely vitamin E acetate. I was worried the THC carts might be inherently unsafe, and that’s why I quit. But knowing it’s an additive that’s causing the problem is making it feel tempted to keep going.

So I'm 30 years old, to be honest I started smoking weed 2 years ago when I first moved in to my own place. I smoke most of the time I'm home and I do so I guess because being stoned makes it more 'enjoyable' especially when you live alone. I'm sure some can relate.  

However, I know that smoking can worsen anxiety and if definitely has for me, which is one of the reasons I want to cut down or stop. For example before when I lived at my parents house I would either be in the gym, in my room watching TV, or out with friends. Now I'm living along my anxiety is so bad I don't want to go to the gym and tbh beforehand people had commented how if bulked out, though now I've lost all that weight! 

I think I'm psychology addicted as every time I'm home i just go to get stoned. Cold turkey was a too hard right now and I've ordered a dry herb vaporiser in the hope of at least cutting out the tobbaco!

Any advice of support? I've thought about maybe limiting myself to 1 smoke per 1 or 2 hours and then cutting that over time so I smoke less and less...

I am a 21F who has been smoking daily since I was 19. I recently decided that I no longer wanted to smoke weed anymore. I haven't smoked in 5 days. I have no cravings for it at all or insomnia, depression, appetite problems that a lot of people complain about.

The only problem is I very quickly developed a super nasty cough and am coughing up dark phlegm. I also kind of feel like I have the flu (headache, sore throat). When I smoked sometimes my phlegm was murky but not this dark.

My energy levels are pretty normal and I feel clear headed as fuck. I thought quitting would be harder but I literally have no desire to smoke, which is super nice. Like an adverse reaction to it.

I don't know if I'm coughing up tar or if this is a symptom from quitting smoking or if I'm just sick. Any ideas on how to help this? Or do you guys think its not sickness at all?",3

It tells me that I used to be more content with myself and life, like I knew who I truly was and lost it since, it tells me I used to enjoy music more, gaming, and it wants to show me this ‘better way’ again. 

In reality, it’s all bullshit. I keep having to remind myself I was so discontent, unfocused, unmotivated, my head was all over the place.

I was originally planning on just lurking as usual, but I decided to post as a way to officially commit to quitting after not smoking for the last 2 days. 

I smoked for the first time at 16, and began smoking daily at 19. I just turned 25 and I’m having somewhat of a quarter life crisis, realizing I’ve wasted the first half of my 20s by telling myself “I’ll do that later.” Getting a budget together, going to the gym, cleaning up my diet, etc. I’ve decided I am DONE. Reading everyone’s posts made me realize I wasn’t alone in how weed makes me feel. It’s going to be difficult, I’m trying to convince my partner of 6 years that it’s for the best so that we just don’t have it around(he seems on board but we’ve said this before lol). A lot of my friendships are centered around weed and I think that’s going to be the most difficult part (though I’ve had other friends tell me they’re quitting/scaling back recently).  I am also taking an indefinite break from drinking as well, so any suggestions for sober social activities would be appreciated

When I went into the kitchen I saw my roommate had written me a note saying “thanks for being the best ever!” (she’s had a really hard week and I was there for her to talk it out with and support her thru it). Next to the note I had seen she gifted me about an 1/8th of her grandma’s home grown weed. 

Between days 10 till now I’ve been feeling mostly great, despite a bunch of crazy vivid dreams. Most of my withdrawal symptoms had dissipated and I wasn’t even feeling tempted to smoke. I have mostly been looking around at my life with newly sober eyes and realizing “fuck, I’ve left so much on pause for all these years. There’s so much to do. It’s intimidating and overwhelming but I’m excited to keep working on myself and moving my life forward”. I think a big contributor to my success has been not having weed in the house to even tempt me. 

My partner is out of town for the rest of the week and my friend had to cancel plans on me tonight because their partner got sick, so I’m all alone with no plans. It’s technically the start of my weekend, and there’s definitely a tiny voice in my head trying to rationalize that it would be okay to smoke because I have no plans, no one to hang out with, and it’s my weekend.

My feelings are.... conflicted. I don’t have anything to do right now so I’m just sitting in my feelings. I have kept myself so busy for the past couple weeks and that has helped so much with the cravings. But now that I have no plans and a free night and a bunch of really nice home grown weed in one of my fave strains just sitting the in the kitchen. I didn’t plan for this scenario because I didn’t see it coming— i haven’t been buying weed or keeping any in the house so I haven’t even been tempted. 

Gah. I’m gonna try and figure out something else to do for the night. Not sure what, though, because I’m so low energy from a hard day’s work but also not sleepy because I already napped after getting home. Gaaahhh.",2

I believe that you can get farther in life without weed and that weed holds a person back from realizing their potential, even if it isn’t destructive. I believe that all stoners are dependent on weed and therefore are addicts. They just have a drug that isn’t lethal like hard drugs, pills, alcohol, etc. That’s the only difference. 

But I look at them and I miss it. 

Today was a decent day at work, but I feel like I took a step closer towards weed, rather than away from it. 

I have to choose... do I want to realize my potential? Or have a few months of relief and desperation and survival? 

The problem is that it’s never as good as in the beginning. 

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know how my recovery will hold up in this next chapter of my life. I know I need to pull it together. And weed only debilitates me and takes away any shot I have.

7 weeks ago I got off work a bit early before a planned camping trip that would start the following afternoon. I got to my place and got high as per usual pattern for the previous summer months.

I immediately felt regret in the moments after getting high. This had become a pretty normal reaction for me. After all, earlier in the year I had a huge chunk of clarity from a 6 month and then 90 day period of not being high. 

How did I get back into the slump of daily weed?  Hard to say exactly. Something about not feeling as much joy. Something about just wanting a release. But it was much different this time.

Now I had trouble ignoring all the negatives that came with it.  So I checked in with my journal and wrote down how I was feeling.

""September 26, 2019 


Things are really bad. No need for any of that this weekend. Totally lost track of where the chain even was.


Sugar out of control


Low exercise


Low energy


Quick temper


Net Slacking


So blue


Same old same old. I could go on and on about the bad.


But the fun part is party all the time. Snacks, food, junk info, etc

The little spark to look forward to. Damn""

And that was it. I left town without my weed. I had made up my mind. The town near where I camped for a few days had a dispensary. I had no interest in going there.

I flipped the switch that I could not find all summer. 

Moving forward now. Positive momentum.",9

In addition I increased my weed intake, going from smoking once a day to 2 times until I was pretty much brain dead stoned 24/7. 

Recently I quit nicotine and went through a whole ordeal with my anxiety and a fling with Wellbutrin (an antidepressant used to stop smoking). 
Then the nausea and morning sickness came back, but worse.

Again, I looked for a million other reasons to blame for this except for the one thing that was actually making me sick; marijuana. 

After 5-6 ER visits over the course of two weeks, I was diagnosed with Cannibanoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Now I’m 2 days of weed. It sucks.

Did you guys suddenly get this tiredness? Maybe I just need more cardio?

2019-11-07 11:56:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dt0hsc/day_1_quitting_6_days_late/,Day 1 Quitting- 6 days late,"Alright. This is pretty damn hard for me to write up but I know that my first step in quitting smoking is telling people my story and being very honest about it. Weed was once such a positive force in my life that led me down roads that expanded my creative capacity and lead me to fields of opportunities. It also lead me to other drug usage, ruined relationships, sketchy adventures, a totally destroyed self esteem. I have had a wild life with tons of fantastic experiences. It becomes muddy when i think about quitting because of all the great times and its reached a point where I need a community to help. I need to move beyond this version of me.

I began smoking when I was in college. When I was growing up weed was around me but I never smoked. It wasn't until the summer of my freshman year I started. I started because I was very interested in altered states of mind, and because i generally disliked alcohol and the things it did to people (there has been alcoholism in my family that's led to a variety of problems). My first year smoking was glorious. I was on a collegiate sailing team that did not require drug tests and myself and a number of sailors worked smoking into our training constantly. I also would smoke after Jiu-Jitsu or other sports like climbing or lifting with friends. For awhile I never had cannabis on me. I was an RA in the dorms, an athlete who would travel around to sail, and I just didn't want to risk it. But things escalated slowly but surely throughout the year to the point that the following summer I would not go to a Spanish class if i wasn't stoned. It was a poor way to live. 

During this time i was also being introduced to mind altering substances like mushrooms and LSD. I was raised a catholic and lost my faith early in college. The mystical aspects of these realms interested me. I identified myself within these experiences and saw myself grow and change in positive, more conscious ways. What I didnt see at this time was me loosing my friends and trading into a new friend group that accepted and promoted the substance work. It never lead to unhealthy usage but it did lead to friendships that in no way shape or form aligned to my sober persona. 

In my 3rd year of college i was still smoking weed daily and occasionally using other psychoactive substances. On Halloween that year I was offered the opportunity to try DMT. Wow. What an experience. I will not waste my time glorifying it, but instead i will admit this is the first moment in my life where i recognized that my cannabis usage was out of control. I stopped for a bit, then got back on it slowly but surely. 

At that time, I lived with a group of stoners who sold large quantities of ganj. We would make good money off it and because we had Colorado connections it was always top shelf in our po-dunk college town. I made new friends who 'liked' me and i continued town this weird and frankly destructive path. One evening we were partying smoking and having beers. I was drugged at this party and kept away from my home while my friends robbed me blind.

 It was devastating. For months I had no clue how it happened until one day 2 of my friends had a little bicker, probably under the influence, and they both turned on each other and told me. I was furious. I threatened to call the cops on their acid stashes and just wanted my money back as I had already decided i was moving to the UK. 

I knew the people around me were a problem so I ended up finding a sailing team in the UK to go sail for. By that summer I  burned my bridges and left for the EU. While traveling across the EU I found weed or hash easy to come by in areas like Greece so sometimes a smoked ans sometimes halt for days on end, without a bother. 

England was one of the best experiences of my life. I look back with yearning to those days and that lifestyle. I was sailing constantly, working on films and had found a rooted interest in working with human rights filmmaking. This has followed me to this day. Alcohol made its way back into my life during this time but didn't stick around once I left (The English and their beer amiright?) There was some smoking but almost all of it was in a healthy and friendly matter. It was hard to get weed, let alone good weed in small town England. I was happy with my life and didn't care. The most often we smoked was maybe twice a week when we wanted to catch 2 films. There was no mixing it with sailing or climbing or any of my adventures. Except Amsterdam, which i went balls to the wall and got stoned and high on magic truffles. Another memory that I look at and say wow i did that. But then question the value of such a hedonistic experience.

Once back I made a b-line for Washington state. It seemed to have everything i wanted. Surf, Sailing, Mountains, Snowboarding, Climbing. Every bit of me. After about 6 months here i began a new relationship that lasted 2 years. This relationship was fused together by weed and trapped within that haze. After about 6 months into it it became very very verbally abusive and on some occasions physical. I did not like who I had become. I began to stop climbing. I stopped sailing. I slowly stopped hiking and being outside. The only thing that continued for me was my filmmaking as a career, and smoking hella pot. Now here's the kicker. As i began my new relationship, i began working for the Cannabis company Weedmaps. Which kicked up my smoking a notch.

Weedmaps was a good bad thing for me. Without it I would not be where I am in my career. But with it I began to justify constant usage. I would travel to dispensaries and get to meet new stoners with significantly more gluttonous habits then myself. It made me feel strong that I could be welcomed into this stoner club but i wasn't at their level. I once again forgot my need to quit. I then left Weedmaps but did not leave the lifestyle behind. I smoke about a gram a day and its been 3 years since then. My relationship fell apart when it just turned into deep self loathing. I then made a horrible decision of cheating with someone who was being nice and caring with me. The past year of my life has been me mentally recovering and forgiving myself, even with all the abuse.

My smoking habit is unique and I want to know what my next steps should be. Telling this story was my first step into coming clean. I smoke daily. About 1 gram, maybe a little less a day rolled up at the end of the day. On weekends its at the start of the day. I maintain a successful job as a documentary filmmaker but its infected this life. I feel totally and completely unable to get confidence for interviews. Editing my own films has completely stopped. I've stopped working on my own projects. I'm constantly fearful that I'm going to loose my job even though Its going great. I have wanted to quit for a year but have not except for a month while i was in Tibet visiting Buddhist monasteries and Everest. The only time i really craved on that trip was on our exit through Kathmandu where monks smoke during meditation. I did not partake but have multiple opportunities to.

Every time I quit my anxiety and ADHD ratched up to a 10. I'm scattered and scared. I feel deep senses of regret. I cant seem to find joy in any of my past life activities. My social anxiety when it comes to fixing my life and changing things and people i'm around is steeped in impostor syndrome. I don't know how to take the next step. But what i will say is I will be sober today. And hopefully tomorrow. 

I don't know what i expected from this or what i need from here. I am struggling and need to share most of all. I want this to be better. I want to be clean. But i'm afraid I'm too weak, too lost, too broken for it to have any value. I depressed that I fucked up a large portion of my young life focused on a drug and drug related experiences.

Not to mention the obvious decline in paranoid thoughts and excessive stress/ worrying. Is the level of emotional control a factor in the consistent use in cannabis? Or is it my imagination?",4

These months have been the most trying, but most worthwhile of my life. I have learned a lot about how to deal with both the positive and negative emotions of life without overreacting to either. As humans, we are hardwired to find that which makes us feel better and those of us with addictive personalities fixate on that and try to remove anything that would make us feel worse. 

In my experience, I found that pot made me feel good, no matter what was happening in my life. It was like a hug I could give myself that released all of my mental anguish and physical pain. I used it to escape from everything, however, this led me to feeling nothing about most things, good or bad. The total numbness caused me to take a lot of things for granted, especially my friends, family and significant others because I didn't realize just how much they did for me or how much they meant to me. 

I have been through the gamut of emotions these past 3 months, from total elation to deep sorrow and grief. (If I am being totally honest, it has been more of the latter than the former.) Dealing with the peaks and valleys of life hasn't been easy, but  I think I'm getting better at it day by day. I am finally learning coping mechanisms that I should have much earlier in life. Practicing mindfulness and learning how to sit with and process my emotions has been by far the most effective strategies I have been shown to deal with life. 

I have now recovered motivation to actually do something with my life. During my initial tries at going to college, I would always lose motivation for subjects I adored (history and music) and, at the time, I assumed I just wasn't suited for college. However, I can see now that it was how I used pot that robbed me of the passion I had for these subjects. I would much rather just hang out and get stoned than do the difficult work of obtaining a degree.

Now that I have been sober, I have decided to go back to school and finish my History BA with hopes of becoming a teacher in the next few years. I want to do something meaningful. I want to be able to give back to the community that has helped me so much and help the next generation learn from our past/current mistakes. I think this is the best way I can do that.

I want to thank everyone in this sub for their stories and ways of coping. The daily affirmation that this was the right choice really helped me get through some dark times. To any and everyone struggling with addiction, you can and will beat the demon. Even if you lapse, just keep on trying. Nothing worth having is easy and it's definitely worth the struggle.

It's nice to know that life is much better when you're present for it.",121

2019-11-07 00:10:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dsswee/seeing_the_mirror_clearly_for_the_50th_time/,Seeing the mirror clearly for the 50th time,"Hi everyone. I sought out this resource earlier tonight, have been reading for several hours now, and feel compelled to write about my own situation. Hearing all these stories has given me courage. I think I'm writing mostly for me, and this will be pretty long, but read on...

I've been a daily smoker for over a decade, with some breaks thrown in when I travel. I've tried to quit many times and always come back. I've written a lot of mediocre poems about my struggle, as well as some cringey journal entries I can't bear to read because they fess up to the problem I did nothing about. I've clearly been contemplating change for a very long time, and I think it is finally here, sooner than I expected.

310 days ago today I gave up alcohol, on January 1st 2019, after a similar drawn out contemplative phase. The effects have been positive; it was the bigger issue for sure. As a result however, my daily weed intake basically doubled. I live with a bipolar diagnosis and have turned to substances to even out my emotions for a long time, so it made sense that my body wanted me to compensate for the absence of alcohol. I did, gladly, with more weed.

I'll be 30 in a few months, and I'll have my first child a few months after that. Although I'm married and have a stable job, I've also burned more than my share of professional bridges already. My current performance at work is middling after a track record of success, and I'm worried for my continued job security there. I cannot escape a looming dread that I've pissed away the best part of my life. (Anyone in your early twenties reading this, seriously, don't ignore the voice that brought you here. Do it soon.) Earlier tonight I told my wife that if I died today, I would be ashamed of my life, and I feel like I need to redeem myself in the next decade. True.

Maybe soon I will do the calendar math to find out exactly how many countless hours I've dedicated to being high. It's absurd; it's depressing. It's enough time to have learned a new language. It's enough to have composed all the song ideas I believed I was generating while stoned. It's enough to have actually experienced nightlife in this city I live in, as opposed to hotly anticipating the solitude of a smoky room on Friday nights. It's enough time to have maintained a much better relationship with my brothers and my parents. It's enough to have gotten a fucking masters degree. Choosing to get high was simultaneously the choice to not pursue any of those things, night after night, weekend after weekend. Talk about opportunity cost.

And don't get me started on the financial cost. I could have paid for that masters degree if every dollar of weed money went towards tuition. Instead, now my wife and I are in debt (have been for years while I continued to smoke, instead of paying it down) with a baby on the way. My dental health is terrible. My mental health is terrible. My concentration is a joke. I don't love reading the way I used to. My home is disorganized. To think: I could have taken action and prevented this. This could be better. I could have chosen differently. It's absolutely maddening.

For months, I've been planning to make the big step to abstain permanently on January 1 2020. I was successful with quitting alcohol because I took the time to make a plan, identify my reasons, etc. After reading all these posts, and now writing my own... I think it's pretty clear. I know what to do. I know what my reasons are. 

Day 1 for me tomorrow. November 7th 2019. Don't wish me luck, just 24 hours of discipline at a time please. 

Thanks for reading

I don't really have much to say today. I got into a bit of a low mood earlier, and briefly considered buying weed and beer.

I've done a really good job so far of managing my decision to quit, especially considering that so many people in my community smoke regularly, and I am invited to partake almost every time I socialize with my friends. To people I am not super close with, I phrase my decision as ""taking a break"" from weed because it's easier to just say that than to have a full-on conversation about my decision. Everyone I know is someone I used to smoke with, whereas if I were meeting knew people I would just tell them that I don't smoke. It's my decision, and I don't feel like explaining a lot of the painful reasons that have led me to quitting weed.


My roommates smoke, my friends smoke, my coworkers smoke, literally everyone around me smokes. I'm a minority, though, and I don't feel as though I want to change my social setting to one outside of my community. My politics align with the people I'm friends with, my social interests align with theirs; I get so much out of my friendships, but it has started to be a little hard to constantly be around a thing that I've decided is a part of my past.

(Day 25),"This has probably been the most annoying side effect of withdrawal. I feel like I can't access that flow. It's like pulling teeth to even get myself to write, and when I finally do, it's a struggle to put together anything remotely good.

&nbsp;

I also feel like my writing isn't as insightful or captivating as it was before. The words used to stream out like a waterfall. Now it takes at least two or three times longer to complete story assignments that I normally write.

&nbsp;

It's not even a lack of inspiration or motivation like I used to experience before. I'm more productive and spend more time writing than I ever have before, but the output is just shit. Like squeezing a dozen lemons and only getting a cup of juice. What's crazy is that I'm super excited about all the people and subjects I'm writing about, and it still doesn't make a difference.

&nbsp;

I journal. I do morning pages. I meditate. I read. I get enough sleep. I exercise. I spend time being present. I engage with things that inspire me. I do all the things that should help the block and also creative flow.

&nbsp;

What am I missing? Is anyone else experiencing this? How did you break through or maybe a better question, when did you break through the creative slump of your recovery?",6

I am always procrastinating on doing stuff and I end up doing NOTHING!.

He gave me ideas on how to work on some new development, I feel pretty great Honestly!...  I would've have met him if I was SMOKING
But listen when I smoke, I run from my problems instead of facing them and solving it all. And it makes my life worse and worse and I struggle like Fuck! 

But one thing is I have all the potentials in working and being responsible but I waste it all SMOKING! So it's just not good for me.. I don't like the struggle!


I am still humble and I hope I get better!

For the last six months I’ve been living that “want to be high when you’re sober, want to be sober when you’re high” life and so weed isn’t even fun for me anymore.

The worst thing of all though, is that I let her slip through my fingers without even giving it a second thought. Weed didn’t drive her away (directly), it just made me into such a loser that I didn’t let her know how much she meant to me, how much I wanted to be with her. Instead, I made no effort to reach out to her, no effort to make *us* a thing, and so she moved on. I don’t blame her one bit.

The past six months or so are kind of a blur. On the one hand, I smoke sativa-dominant hybrids which do make me more creative and more motivated in some ways. I have good ideas for work (I'm a researcher in physics) and do creative projects often, read lots of books etc. However, the cons are really starting to outweigh the pros. I eat way too much junk food and get way too little exercise, I sleep poorly so I can never get up for work, I'm always late and tired when I get there. Every night I smoke because I can't bear to not get high before going to bed and having to get up for work the next day. But then smoking stops me sleeping well and the problem just gets worse. I'm getting desperate now because I'm only a few months away from my doctoral thesis submission deadline (I'm a PhD candidate) and my work is sluggish and I'm always tired and just waiting to get high so I can feel good.

I've been a habitual smoker for about 3 years now, smoking throughout my entire time in undergrad. I was always able to justify it to myself, as I live an active lifestyle and was always good at school. Lately, I just feel as if it's become more of a crutch than a joy in my life. I gave myself every reason to smoke, while ignoring all the reasons not to. 

 I'm a 22M and finally decided that weed has been taking away from my life more than it was enhancing it- I have an addictive personality and would tell myself every excuse under the sun why it's okay to light up daily. I just recently quit graduate school, and felt like it was a good time to just start over. There's been so much stress and uncertainty with this major life change I'm going through, but I had to decide for myself that weed was no longer doing me any good except for an escape from my troubles.   I don't have any extreme physical withdrawals (yet anyways), but it's the mental aspect that really gets to me. Weed always occupied my free time, and now that I've decided to quit it seems like time can go in slow motion sometimes. With my recent spike in free time from discontinuing school, it's tough to stay away from it, especially when the majority of my roomates partake daily. If anyone out there is thinking about stopping, just know you have support and there's people out there rooting for you.

It seems like a great place to share my experiences after recently quitting and gain insight from the experiences of others, so here goes. 

For about a year and a half I was smoking weed pretty much every day. The longest I ever went without was one week, that happened about three or four times. I realized it was a problem when I failed a class for the first time ever last fall. Last spring I took a semester off to rectify the problem, but it ended up just being an excuse to smoke weed everyday with no consequences. This September I went back to school, and went almost two months without smoking. I started to feel better and better each day. I feel so much sharper and motivated when I am not smoking however I am still struggling to experience what life was like before I became a daily user. I went home for fall break about three weeks ago, and, being around my stoner friends again, I ended up making the choice to smoke. The feeling was intense, I felt a great deal of emotion when I was high that time. After not smoking for almost two months my tolerance was gone, so I was extremely high and I was feeling extremes of emotion I hadn't felt in years. Everything felt significant. I ended up smoking pretty much every day during the break, and I quickly fell back into the slump of doing absolutely nothing, I also started smoking tobacco again, a habit I picked up to boost my high or have something to smoke when I couldn't get weed. Now I am back at school and it has been 11 days since I smoked. I found my relapse to be a tremendous learning experience. It gave me a lot of insight into why I started smoking everyday in the first place, and what I missed by doing so. Each day  sober I am capable of doing work unlike when I am high. When I am sober I get things done and feel generally content, but something seems to be missing. I experience emotion far less often, and it is much duller than it used to be. I get excited about far fewer things than I used to, and when I do get excited it is to a far lesser degree. I am focused on my classes, which are time consuming, so I don't often feel the urge to smoke, but I feel like I would have extreme difficulty resisting if I was given an opportunity to do so. Life in general just feels duller and less vibrant. So that's my experience so far. Is anyone else having a similar experience after quitting? Does anyone who has been weed-free for a lot longer than me have any insight about what I am feeling? Will things return to normal anytime soon? 

Thank you for reading, and I wish you all the best in remaining stalwart in the struggle to quit!",3

So I'm thinking: how did we come to this as a species? Using a drug has really become a ""profession "" for some. It's really not a personality trait, or a talent lol Of course, popularity is a fleeting thing and if these people don't have any other interest or skills, when they grow older, they will have no real jobs.

I've had a few sections in there where I stopped for a while (One for almost a year, none totally voluntary), but it's been around 3 years since I didn't smoke for more than a week straight.

I've been thinking about quitting for a while. I'm pretty antisocial, which I hide well by just being ""quiet"", but I never start conversations, I avoid events, and never initiate get togethers (and have to force myself to go when invited). When I'm talking to someone, it almost seems like I'm right on the verge of knowing what to say, but just can't think of any valuable input (More-so in a group, and especially when playing a game like never have I ever where I have to pull something out of thin air). I don't know if anyone here knows what I'm talking about or if it's even weed related at all or just a personal issue, but it's so frustrating. This has been my biggest issue with myself for as long as I can remember. 

I would love to love to be around people, but the anxiety from knowing I won't be able to keep a conversation going is a huge factor in me avoiding social events, parties etc... I've always thought this was just the way I am; it's been the case for as long as I remember, but how would I know? I started smoking when I was 15 and I barely remember shit before that. 

I started grad school (Doctorate) this semester, so the workload has increased pretty drastically, and I'm in a small class with the same people all day. I've met some awesome people and want to be involved in clubs, study groups, etc., but I just can't get myself to make it happen. Last night, I ran out of weed and immediately got more. When I got back, it kind of just hit me how pathetic it was.

 I want to quit, but both of my roommates smoke daily and it's so hard to hear them hitting the bong downstairs and not join them. I'm excited to be done with it for most of the day, but it's all I want to do when I'm at home in the evening.

Thanks to anyone who read this far! This started as me looking for advice and turned into just ranting. Just wanted to see if anyone could relate, and say that today is day 1 for me!",8

I have tried again and again and again to stop, but (in a legal state) always find myself behind the wheel to pick up, asking a friend to cruise, or just sucking nonstop on empty cartridges, waiting for more money to hit my account or for a friend to follow through. 

I can’t stop lying to everyone, and myself. My partner, my boss, my family, my friends. I feel so alone. Even with my boss (who is like family), who brought me to one of their own support group meetings. Ever since the one time, I felt ashamed and embarrassed for struggling with “simply weed” and haven’t gone since. I lie and lie about how “I’m doing much better now” or “it’s been x weeks”, even though I just coughed out my lung on the drive over. 

And my partner... I can’t even begin to talk about this deception. I hate myself for it. For what?! It’s just fucking weed. 

My work is being affected. I’m writing down social security numbers wrong, writing down birthdays wrong, and just doing completely simple mistakes that are costing so many other employees HOURS of extra work. I can’t keep on living like this. I’m supposed to talk to people on the phone and be my charismatic self, but I can’t stop falling into anxious loops whereupon I freeze. 

I’ve already blown through two full battery charges while sucking away at empty carts tonight. I need to make tonight be the night. I feel so sick, I feel so angry, I feel so sad, and I feel so anxious. I don’t feel in control of anything, I feel like I’m spiraling, and I feel like nobody cares or is on my side. I get anxious going into work, I get anxious going to the gym, and all I can think about is how I’m going to smoke next. 

I don’t know what the FUCK TO DO ANYMORE. I feel like I’m going crazy. Whether I’m actually depressed and anxious and use weed to cope or if weed is making me feel this way... I don’t know, but I’m going insane and don’t see any way out. I keep fooling myself and thinking I’m strong, but I’ve slipped so magnificently in the last month and a half. 

Anyway. Thanks for listening.",5

I'm feeling better now but it took a couple hours to come down.

This sucks. It won't deter me, but remind me not to go back to the weed. It's a really crippling feeling, basically ruined my whole day. Reaching out to remind others to stay strong and you're not alone.

Anyway, back on topic: amazingly I'm still having night sweats. But they're not nearly as bad as a week or so ago, and I think it depends on the heat in my home, ventilation etc. 

Other than that, like I've said before, I'm in post acute withdrawal territory now. Yah me 😆. 

These are much more subtle symptoms I'm presuming?

The cravings for weed and alcohol that went away after the first 4 days are now starting to return. 😐

It's a little disheartening if I'm honest. And at around a month or two off weed, it's historically the beginning of the end of sobriety in all of my previous quit attempts. 😡

This is the point onwards where i start to entertain the idea of relapsing. And around 4 months, I usually crack and fall right back into full blown addiction. 

I'm determined to not let that happen this time. And that is the reason I joined reddit and this community. 

I'm not going to relapse tonight so i'm not desperate. But I can feel the cravings starting to rear there head. And becoming more and more common.

My first post on reddit so be nice please 🙏

So i smoked pretty heavily every day for around 3 years. I didn't realise it had become a problem until recently and im now 2 weeks clean. My whole life revolves around weed, i spend money i dont have on it and have completely isolated myself so i can stay in and smoke alone. I dont have friends that smoke so i cant blame it on being a social thing. I've just moved to a flat without a garden with a girl who doesnt know I smoke so i would have to sneak around to do it now which i dont want to do.

 At first I had a few sleepless nights but was expecting this.  The last few nights though ive had the worst nightmares and night sweats I've ever experienced. I woke up crying this morning and couldn't stop for around an hour because it just felt so real. I suffer with anxiety anyway and i have had a pretty shitty year so i know smoking was masking some issues im going to have to deal with but im getting tempted to smoke just to stop these dreams.  I have pretty easy access to valium and sleeping tablets but i dont want to use this and form a new addiction. 

Has anybody else had the same? How did you manage it and how long did it last?

This is a throwaway as a few of my friends and my husband know my main account. I hope someone can help.

I have a very addictive personality. Alcoholism is rife in both my mother and father's side of the family, and they're all nasty, mean drunks - not my parents themselves, but their families. Because of that I don't drink; I just don't like it. But I do smoke, and keep telling myself 'well at least I'm a happy stoner and not a vicious alcoholic'. But I am no longer happy and want to quit.

I met my now husband back in 2010 and he was a heavy weed smoker. I wasn't so much, but I did enjoy it. We fell in love, I met all his friends, most of whom were stoners, and weed was everywhere. Which I thought was great because like I said, I very much enjoyed it. There were a lot of parties, a lot of experimenting with drugs, most of which has died down now that we're all in our 30s. The weed, however, is still going strong.

I suffer from pretty bad depression and crippling anxiety, and have been on medication for both since I was about 18. Because of this, nobody except my husband knows how much I smoke because honestly, I'm mortified at myself for putting my mental health at risk like this after working so hard in my early 20s to get myself healthy. Regardless of what people say, I do not believe weed helps my mental illness, I believe it just delays my panic attacks until I'm sober.

Anyway, on to how often I smoke. The thing is, my husband does not believe I have a problem because I smoke one joint per night. That's all - no more, but crucially, no less. It's a tiny amount compared to some of you guys, but it's not the amount, it's the fact that without it I am grumpy, anxious, irritable, an insomniac and just generally very unpleasant to be around. I have a very low tolerance too, so when i do have my joint I am a zombie. I'm just sprawled on the couch watching mindless shit on tv when I could be doing... well, anything else.

The problem I'm facing is that I'm afraid that since my husband and I have never known each other as non-smokers, that our relationship will crumble once I'm sober. And I intend to be sober, as soon as is humanly possible because I am sick and tired of living like this. I love him, both sober and stoned, but I know he has no intention of giving up. It's probably just the anxiety talking, but I'm genuinely afraid one day 6 months or a year or whatever from now, we'll look at each other and go shit, we have nothing in common anymore. And that fear, regardless of how much truth is behind it, is what has given me the excuse not to quit yet. It's such a silly excuse because essentially what I'm saying is I'm planning to stay unhappy so that me and my husband can be happy..? It makes no sense, but that's probably just the part of my brain that is an addict grasping at straws.

I don't know what exactly I am asking here.. maybe just, has anyone else had a similar problem? Should I try to get him to quit too or do it myself? Has anyone's relationship fallen apart once one partner quit and the other didn't? Any perspective would be great as this is the first time I've ever voiced these concerns. Thank you all",4

The vivid and continuing dreams are a common one. But here I am at over 200 days free from weed, and I am STILL having them. They are odd and bizarre, and make me wake up. Then when I sleep again, they will often continue, or at least follow some kind of thread. Last night one involved me toking, which I hate. I wake up feeling unsettled. I haven't smoked a cigarette in over 15 years, and still occasionally dream that I am lighting one up (hilarious considering tobacco literally makes me ill). I guess once you have an addiction your brain never lets you forget it.

Has anyone else had the dreams last this long? Or heard of it? I thought for sure they would pass by now.",2

It's me, the foul mouth negative guy who posted a few days ago. 

Its day 5 and I'm still here. My urges have been less strong and ive been less spiteful for sure. 

On a shitty note, I'm still dealing with:

- sweating. Like, a lot. (Why?)
- trouble getting to sleep 

On a positive note:

- sleeping through the night
- mornings are so much less hazy 

On a side note, I went to work yesterday and told my boss/mentor that I was giving weed the boot. He said to me with a surprised look on his face, ""Oh really? I thought that was your thing. You're the weed guy.""

Stopped me in my fucking tracks. I never thought I was viewed that way. As the ""weed guy"", especially by a person I look up to. Add, ""how I'm perceived by others"" to the list of reasons to quit. 

Walking is helping. A few times I've had cravings I just throw my jacket on and go walking. My dog is pretty happy about this, haha. 

Here's a big relief too. I went to the doctor yesterday for an unrelated issue, and while I was there I asked my doctor about my weed use affecting my fertility (wife and i have been TTC for a while). Thankfully she said there's no evidence to suggest that there's an affect on my sperm, although she gave my shit for smoking anyways. ""Particle damage to the lungs, is particle damage to the lungs,"" she said. I always had a deep fear I've ruined our chances of having a baby because of 8 years or regular weed use. Was relieving to hear her say I haven't. 

I feel good. But a little nervous because I know I've still got a few weeks before my dopamine levels figure their shit out. 

Will update you beautiful motherfuckers closer to end of week. Thx all.",9

Been smoking for over 15 years basically every day. I have given up in the past on 2 occasions, once for 8 months once for 3 months. God knows why i come back suppose I thought i could have 1 and that never works out for me. Im all or nothing with weed!

So anyway here we are day 1!

Why im giving up:

I have bad anxiety

I have bad PTSD

I hate being in a hazed state

I want my life back

I want more money

I dont want to smoke tobacco

I want to be more productive

I want to be motivated to get a new job

I have 2 kids and they need a clear minded Dad

I probs could list things all day long but there are a few reasons

&#x200B;

Why I never end up giving up and what im scared to miss:

Gaming

&#x200B;

Im not joking that is all i could write, when i go home tonight all i want to do is play COD or The Outer Worlds but when i give up i struggle to get into a game or find it boring! So rather then sit bored for a couple nights while im getting over my addition ill prefer to spend my hard earned money so i can game in peace. Rather then give up to gain all the possitives i mentioned.

&#x200B;

FML, i actually hate weed because it makes you think in this stupid way! Right now at work i feel up for it tonight, i want to do it but when im driving home thats when my stupid mind plays tricks!

Sorry for going on, and sorry if my writing is crap (Never been good at English) but i need to write some stuff down, suppose i can maybe re-read it when im itching for a bag later!

You were experienceing things I refused to acknowledge. Those posts helped me begin  the soul searching needed to start this process. Weed had such a grip on me. It still does. but I want to rip this old shell of a man off and punch through to the depths of my character. I want to find the person who was lost in that cloud of smoke.

The biggest mistake of my life, was to take that toke of green. Never did I think a plant, could be so cruel and mean.  What once seemed so true and real, now is just a dream. A demon so it seems. It hides away so quiet, whispering sweet nothings. But now it’s got you in it’s grips, and things they start muffling. in reality it kills you, uproots you from your life. When once you hated suffering, you now crave pain and strife. All you want is feeling, you’re dead while you’re alive, all because you let him have you, I wish you just realized. I know you don’t believe. Because you’re in to deep, I know you wont conceive. It comes just like an angel, a savior you’ve achieved. But before you know it’s got you, So fast that You won’t see. In just the blink of eye, you started to feel high. It takes control to manifest, it wants to feel alive. But slowly slowly you roll down hill, right to your demise. No it doesn’t kill you, it’s always safe they say. But one day as an empty shell, a hefty price you’ll pay. What once was fuller than fullness, is emptiness itself. What once you thought was heaven, has slowly turned to hell. You’re stuck inside your head, you can’t seem to get out. No matter how fucking loud, you try to scream and shout, you’ll surely start to doubt. He’s got you where he wants you, Now he’s got control. Who thought that just a whisp of smoke, could drag away your soul. Now he’s having fun, he does all that he wants. Just cause you could not put down, That motherfucking blunt.",47

The first two weeks were surprisingly really easy, I was really motivation and even if I had some cravings I really appreciated my sober self. But for a week now, I have been having terrible nightmares, every night, multiple times a night... It almost always revolve on escaping from stressful situations (like being chased by the cops or monsters or stuff like that) or being trapped somewhere I don't recognize from real life, like house in the woods or old castle. 

I'm pretty stressed right now because of my studies (I'm on my masters degrees, and I chose a field that is not hiring, which stresses me a lot already), because I couldn't renew my contract for my job (and I'm now unemployed) and because my boyfriend is moving out from our town (Paris) to go to the north of the country whereas I can't move. These added to the stress of stopping weed has made me worried all the time, I can feel it in my stomach. So the question is, are these nightmares caused mainly because of quitting weed ? And what Can I do to feel a little less worried ? 
I guess I also need some motivation

2019-11-05 04:10:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/drwpns/ready_to_be_sober/,Ready to be sober.,"About 6 months ago I was here looking for support and help about quitting smoking pot. After 6-7 years of daily smoking I found myself in a situation where all I was doing was wating to be high and waiting for the next morning when im not high. I found some courage to stay away thanks to this subreddit. For a while things looked brighter, I was sober for 2 weeks. Then came a hangover so huge I thought ""Well might aswell buy 1g and take the edge of this feeling"". NOW 6 months later I sort of wake up from this little relapse..... In summer smoking ofc didnt bother me as it never does, Summer is love. But now for the past few months its been dark. Waking up too late for work, being exhausted, just waiting to get home to get high again and then waiting for the day to end. Past week I had 5 free days which I spent inside 4 walls smoking so much weed that I dont really understand how I even did it. Skipped a good friends housewaming party. Videogames, wanking, youtube&netflix. Didnt really enjoy any part of this.. Boring and fuzzy days. These 4 days cost me a fortune in weed and fucking munchies. Last night my stash ran dry and I came to a realisation: ""I neeeeeed to quit now and fucking stick to it"" If winter comes by and im doing this IM gonna be soo depressed. SO now the first sober morning and I feel comfident about this and at the same time Im loosing it on the inside. Being without weed is not a problem physically (sherlock) and thats the hardest thing about it. You feel in control even after few days of not smoking and then its EASY to relapse.

2019-11-05 02:36:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/drvy6u/day_111_seeing_the_big_picture_now/,Day 111. Seeing the big picture now.,"After 8 years of smoking daily, going through an ounce per week, I've finally quit. For me I had to move to a new city where I didn't know anyone to make it possible. 

Now on day 111 looking back and seeing the changes I can see the big picture. Weed was simply a small aspect of the bigger problem. I have a problem with dependency and procrastination. I would rather sacrifice getting ahead for temporary comfort. 

That's why I smoked so heavily. Now that I've stopped little changes have happened such as I laugh more, but now I'm addicted to playing World of Warcraft because of the temporary comfort it provides. If I didn't have WoW it would be YouTube videos and so forth. 

If you're expecting to quit and have a miraculous change, don't expect it like how I did. Instead use the opportunity to dig deeper and start to resolve the real issue. 

For me, I need to quit wow. Stop fapping and porn even though that's like once every two days it's still an addiction since childhood. Start going to gym to build discipline and focus on working hard. As long as I have instant gratification readily available I cannot focus on what I need to. 

So this is me looking back and finally realizing quitting weed was never my issue, digging deeper I have to make changes in my personality and fight either bad programming from childhood or genetics. I cannot pinpoint exactly where or when I became so addictive to things but it's my true fight. It started with giving up weed though, and very soon WoW. 

Am considering quitting WoW very soon. Reducing my technology in-take. Changing diets and starting to exercise again. Drastic changes produce drastic results and I'm not proud of who I currently am, but at least I'm no longer blaming it on weed and now I see it's me who has these internal issues which need fixing.",12

22 yr smoker here. After a couple of failed attempts last month, I finally got through the first 48hr weed free. The first day wasn't too bad but day two was pretty awful. Every time I do this I seem to get different withdrawal symptoms. Last night I went to bed early and just started sweating until I was totally drenched. My gf came to bed a couple of hours later, curled up next to me for a cuddle but as her hand touched my skin I felt her recoil and wipe the sweat of her hands lol. Don't blame her tbh. I've read about the night sweats but never had them before. It was a very uncomfortable night. Woke up feeling anxious, depressed and nauseous. Feeling a bit better after a hot shower.... but... totally forgot I had an 9am exam this morning. Oh dear, I don't think this is gonna go well. Gotta be in it to win it though :)

Mostly because I haven't been up to standard in college, and I feel like sitting and smoking all day every day. 

I don't know if it's bad but I'm getting concerned with the quantity and constant replenishing of it, since I have my own green house and multiple plants money is not an issue (still I'm not rich), and taking care of the plants has been therapeutic for me, sometimes even spending entire evenings sitting there in the green house doing whatever else once I finish the daily care.

I don't want to stop growing weed but I also don't want to keep smoking, so I put all my dried weed in a safe that only my sister has the combination to (she lives a couple hours from my city), therefore his last week I've been scraping pipes, collecting little pieces just to get a hit, and that's when I realized I had a problem.

I wonder, what did you guys made you change your habit? Maybe my reason is not much but I gotta change my life before I get stuck in that loop again.

Also, what about the cravings? I haven't felt the *need* to get high but I always catch myself before bed searching for a little nug or something since I used  to smoke a lot before bed.

Thanks for your answers and I'm sorry if this doesn't fit here, I'm actually just searching for a reason not to leave it but I can't deny that it's holding me back.",7

This weekend I was talking to a friend about it, he's always as blunt and honest as he can be but also has the sunshiny personality of a Labrador.. Anyway, he said ""well what is causing you to fail in your goals?"" And I rattle off some excuses and complaints.. Like, I'm an addict, it's fucking hard, it's soo easy for me to walk to the store and buy weed... 

Jimmy says ""if this is really what you think you need and want deep in your heart, stop fucking complaining and making excuses and just do it. Just stop smoking weed."" Of course my initial reaction is to say that I'll try and that it's just... Fucking hard man!! 

We all have the power to overcome the piece of our brain that keeps dragging us back down. It's a fucking thirsty bitch just looking for a dopamine fix.. I can create my OWN fucking dopamine, bitch. 

I am done with this shit. Weed literally makes me feel like I'm shitting my pants at this point. Idk when the sensations decided to settle on my butthole.. But it's just fucking paranoia, self loathing, and weird butt tingles. (I mean also a bunch of dopamine..) I think after a while and with the right supplemental activities, I can regulate my dopamine production again. 

In two weeks when my brain says ""come on, just one more pleeease"" I will say no.

Today is my first day quitting weed.  I’m almost 21 years old and I’ve been smoking everyday for a little over a year with the exception of a couple months off this past summer. I have a love/hate relationship with marijuana.  I was an addict.  I used to be a motivated kid with dreams like everyone else but I let marijuana take control of my life.  I used to smoke at night, then I started smoking after school, then I started smoking before class, then eventually I started waking and baking and I’d spend my entire day completely ripped.  I got into that awful routine to help numb my ADHD, anxiety, and depression and to be completely honest, I just loved being high, and it is a feeling I will love until the day I die.  I would plan my entire day around weed.  I would be too scared to leave my dorm some days if I didn’t smoke.

I can write about my addiction for hours and how it changed me negatively, distanced me from friends and family, high tolerance, etc., but you guys all really know how it is already so I won’t say anything else about it.  I’ve always thought about becoming an emt/firefighter and that career field and marijuana don’t mix at all obviously.  The moment I knew I should quit weed was when started thinking about future careers that would let me smoke constantly even if I had no interest in it.  It really pissed me off that I actually was considering picking a career field that would let me smoke weed over something I actually love and have interest in.

My life was better before I started smoking everyday.  I was in really good physical shape, had confidence, and had goals I wanted to accomplish, but once I chose the daily stoner life I lost all of that.  I was sad I chose that path, and I knew I wasn’t going to be going anywhere, but that’s how much I loved weed.  For awhile I would deny the fact that I had a weed problem in my brain even if I know I did.  I would come up with dumb excuses in my head that gave me a good reason to smoke even if it wasn’t.  Eventually my depression got worse and I started getting suicidal thoughts and all that awful shit I don’t even want to talk about.

So to wrap it up, I’m going to get weed out of my life.  I’m going to get back into good shape and pursue a first responder career in firefighting and EMS.  I know it’s easier said then done and these next couple of weeks are going to suck because I’m one of the lucky ones that experiences weed withdrawals. Last time I stopped smoking for a bit I had no appetite, couldn’t sleep, increased anxiety, cold sweats and chills. Hopefully the nightmares aren’t too bad this time around...

For anyone that’s in the same boat as me, we can definitely get over our addiction and move on with our lives for the better.  Anyone who is going through the same shit, feel free to message me if you want. I don’t know how much of a help I’ll be but I’ll listen to you and just know we are going through the same thing, and we will win.  Thanks to those who read this.",6

I started checking out r/leaves last December when I decided to quit weed and to seek therapy for my addictions. I ended up quitting for most of the week, but would go back to smoking with my homies on weekends (hence why I didn't feel comfortable sharing my experience with this sub). 

I managed to go for 4 months smoking less than a gram a week. I immediately saw the effects: I was working harder, felt better about myself and had a better relationship with basically everyone around me. In April, when the weather got nice again, I went back to my old habits : smoking up to 1.5 g a day by myself and spending my free time playing video games. I stopped showing up to therapy. 

I'm tired of this and I want to go back to how I felt last winter. Even better I want to quit weed completely now, no more lighting a hot one with the boys on weekends. Wish me luck, I'll keep you posted!",6

But I’ve had my most productive 4 weeks at work and got assigned to a really incredible opportunity.  I’ve paid off $5K worth of my $20K in credit card debt.  I’ve rekindled my relationship with my parents.

Weed made me so apathetic that I buried myself in debt and surrounded myself with toxic people.  I was having an INCREDIBLY FUN TIME BEING HIGH!  

But after several paranoid, sleepless nights, I finally found the courage inside me to make a positive, yet difficult life decision.  After 10 years of daily use, I’ve never felt better or more confident than I do today.  I’m genuinely enjoying my sobriety.

I’m ready to live again.",275

I’ve always consider day 3 to be the hump. I know there’s many more difficult months ahead of me, but the third day of sobriety is usually when I break. 

Waking up and getting on with my day is hard. I managed to get myself to work today, even though I was a couple hours late. I noticed when I was there that I’m more confident engaging in conversation with my coworkers then if I were high. Usually I’m very to myself and I might say hi but that’s it. 

When I got home the irritability and anxiety started to settle in again. I think this for me is the worst part so far. I’ve been doing planks or (trying) to do a pull up just to release any pent up frustration. It’s not a bad start. 

However, I turned to my diary for some clarity and came up with a good thought. What would I rather have happen? Smoke weed, take the edge off, and hate myself, probably slip into a depression for the rest of the week, Or fight through the cravings and be proud of  myself. 

I chose the latter! 
I hope you do too! 
Good luck friends! :)",20

A couple of hits might be good but when it becomes an all consuming all day obsession, then it is not a good thing anymore. 
I enjoy waking up in the morning after sleeping decently and looking at my face.

W/O MJ, my skin appears moist and soft (still wrinkles cuz of my age but not near as pronounced), not puffy. But my eyes are most remarkable because they are bright and clear to me and I can see that person inside me that wants to just live life, do my thing, and be happy.

Just wanted to make my first Week 1 thread as today counts a whole week of quitting cold turkey, and just wanted to point out what I experienced quick and my symptoms and what I'm still going through now. I seriously seriously appreciate this community so much and have learned a lot checking here every day and talking with some great people!

Here are the symptoms I've experienced and am still experiencing! Reminder I was a smoker for 3 years, first two years my usage wasn't that heavy but this whole year I was a daily smoker.

**Sleep** - The first 3 days I didn't sleep that great, lots of night sweats and racing thoughts and the first 2 days waking up with heightened anxiety and a high heart rate. I was only able to sleep with the help of sleep aids. Luckily, this past weekend I slept awesome, Friday-Sunday I started to feel tired and sleepy after dinner time which helped a lot, I didn't need sleep aid to help put me to sleep and had little to no night sweats. I had very very vivid dreams every night and I slept in a lot this weekend due to just having an exhausting first week of withdrawals. It also helped sleeping with my gf and having that comfort system. Hoping this week my job tires me out and I sleep good with little to no issues! I always used to smoke before bed so I know it'll take a little longer than usual for my body to get back to falling asleep naturally.

**Appetite** - This one was one of the worst symptoms I experienced, had little to no appetite during the first 4-5 days, lost around 6 lbs and had a decent amount of nausea. My appetite is slowly improving though every day, having cravings for food and pushing myself to eat more, eat healthier things, calorie dense foods, etc. Being back at work helps build up an appetite too so I hope by the end of this week or next week it starts to go back to normal.

**Anxiety and Depression** - Anxiety was complete hell this whole week and still sort of is. Day by day it went from constant anxiety, to anxiety spikes and now it's sort of sitting at anxiety spikes with random bouts of crying (my anxiety always has made me cry though sometimes, so nothing new for me) My depression is feeling a bit off and sadly heightened, especially when I'm alone and start to dwell. I've been taking walks and again being back at work and keeping my mind off of it has been helping, so I'm going to stick with my daily walks and just trying to keep myself distracted to prevent sitting and dwelling. It's very hard to keep that routine but I'm trying and everyone here always recommends to exercise and just keep busy as much as possible, so I will stick with that. I only get to see my gf on the weekends and sometimes during the week, so today I missed her a lot and cried a few times but talking with her throughout the day helps and I may stay at her place sometime this week to be with her and feel better, she's been amazing through all of this and my biggest support system.

**Cravings** - Zero, none, not a single craving to smoke. I'm done with weed. My horrible trip that triggered me quitting cold turkey and the horrible scary time I had with my withdrawals has opened my eyes wide open I'm done with this drug, it has hurt and scared me and I never want to go back.

To prevent this from being a really long post lol that sort of sums up my withdrawal symptoms, I'm seeing the physical ones subsiding day by day and going back to work today knowing I'm well and fit for work again is a good sign and I feel good about that. My only concern is through the next few weeks of recovery are my mental withdrawal symptoms, mainly my anxiety, depression, feeling lost and bored. I'm going to try to stay as strong as possible and surround myself with my gf, friends and family and again, stay productive and busy as much as I can to keep myself distracted. It's going to be a shitty battle in that area but again I'm just going to wait and see how I am the next few weeks and go from there. Thank you for reading this and I wish everyone the best of luck of what they're going through!",27

2019-11-04 15:10:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/drnbj2/this_is_my_1st_reddit_post_ever_i_need_to_tell/,"This is my 1st reddit post ever, I need to tell you my story. It takes just 1 week","So I've never posted a reddit thread, or a post in a thread - I'm so new here that I don't even know the terminology lol, but alas I am here. I know what reddit is, I know there's a strong sense of community here for different reasons, and I'm here because I'm at the point where I no longer enjoy marijuana which is insane to even type...this shift happened in 1 damn week...read along. For perspective, I've been smoking for the last 3 years, about 5 times a week minimum.

I want to share my unique story (technically we all have unique stories right...lol).

I am sort of a public figure with a substantial following (hundreds of thousands of fans) and I've been living my dream for the past 3 years now - or at least, I was. I say that humbly, to show you how far I made it in my career and how happy I was...and what I accidentally threw away. For me, smoking weed was fun and gave me video ideas, it let me visualize my videos and how people would react to them if they were to watch them, I came up with countless cool scenes in my head, and so on. It used to be fun to do with other notable figures who I will not mention by name for obvious reasons, and the culture around it, especially in Los Angeles, was such that it was a fun time, it's in every music video, it's at every party, and damn near every damn girl smokes it in that crazy city. So it was introduced into my life as a means for a good time, not necessarily to combat pain, depression, stress or anxiety.

Fast forward to today, and weed was no longer that 'fun' plant anymore. Here's the thing - I read different posts on here that go something like this: 'I want to quit when I'm high, but I want to get high when I'm sober'. For me, it actually didn't get to that point. I had to stop smoking for 1 week, last week, to understand how bad this plant really was for me. For me,  ignorance was bliss. Being high was the normal, and being sober was not normal. So, since being high was the 'norm', here's what my 'norm' life looked like...some of you may relate to this like crazy:

**THE NORM**

\- Wake up groggy, brain fog, dazed and confused

\- My 'day' would start around 4pm...aka, that's when my 'real' energy kicked in, and I could finally start actually being productive

\- I would constantly have bad short term memory, but I attributed this to self diagnosed ADD...which I don't even think I have anymore after stopping weed for a week. I'll get to this a little later

\- Bad eating, ONLY when high

\- I would end the uneventful and unproductive day off with a 'productive creative' weed session, and write down video ideas, life goals, and other realizations in my notepad while high

This last point is very important, because contrary to what was REALLY going on, these sessions were not creative, nor productive. In fact, they were slowly me down, stopping me from actually being productive. Now I mentioned that I achieved my dream in that I became a public figure with a large following, and I loved it. I loved spreading happiness and good energy to many people around the world, mainly a young demographic who looked up to me. Weed stopped me from posting videos for almost 1 year. I threw away my dreams because I was no longer productive, but I 'thought' these sessions were productive.

""I'll just keep smoking to get better and better ideas for my future video, which will be amazing once I eventually post!!"" That sentence was recycled for almost 1 f\*\*\*ing year. I was stuck in this nasty cycle, and threw away my dream job. Now scroll back up and check out the **NORM** schedule...how in the hell is one supposed to be productive when THAT becomes your norm??

Another thing I want to mention is that I used to weigh about 165 lbs and I was ripped af. I loved fitness, I loved working out, I watched what I ate and researched how food actually affects your body. Well when weed came into my life, that was all gone, and I got up to over 230 lbs. It was gradual, but it happened. So it's either a MASSIVE coincidence, or there's a strong correlation between:

\- weed smoking and gaining weight

\- weed smoking and eating unhealthy

\- weed smoking and stopping YouTube uploads, and my YouTube career

\- weed smoking and loss in productivity

\- weed smoking and absolutely no life schedule

&#x200B;

For perspective, I've tried to lose weight. I've been trying to lose weight for about 3 years now, since I started smoking, but for some *unknown* reason, I couldn't lose weight. I know what I needed to do, but it wasn't happening.

**So last week, I didn't smoke at all, longest I've done in 3 years. Here were my results:**

&#x200B;

|**Average Day, Last Week (no smoking weed)**|**Average Regular Day (smoking weed)**|
|:-|:-|
|Woke up at 9am daily|Woke up between 11am - 12pm daily|
|Ate 1700 calories|Ate about 3000 calories|
|Wasted 0 hours on weed|Wasted 4 hours grinding weed, smoking, relaxing, watching videos, chilling|
|My 'real' brain function began at 11am|My 'real' brain function began at 4pm|
|Brain clarity, sharp, quick-witted|Brain fog, short term memory confusion|
|Woke up flat stomach and energized|Woke up stomach bloated from bad meal at night|
|Weight at end of week = 214.8 lbs|Weight before stopping weed = 224 lbs|

*\*my weight fluctuates a lottttt, my body is such that I can put on 30 lbs in a month, but also lose 30 lbs in a month. I probably lost a lot of water weight, but still lost a lot of damn weight.*

Now I'm not looking at weed as a 'bad' thing. In fact, weed is amazing. It allows your brain to wander into the unknown, sometimes into euphoria. There could be a *coincidence* relating to last week, in that I was more aware that I stopped smoking weed, thus I went to the gym, ate healthier, and thus lost weight. But f\*ck that, it was NOT a coincidence. I've been trying for 3 damn years to achieve what I achieved last week, and I could not do it. 3 damn years. The one week I don't smoke weed, and I achieve all of that. It was the weed, plain and simple. The plant I used to love, the plant that put me in euphoric states, that gave me vision and let me see the future. Weed was amazing, and I did get a lot out of it. But now, I need my life back and I need to finally achieve my purpose, and I can finally believe in myself again because at some point, I lost confidence and self-belief. That self-belief and confidence is what got me here in my career, and I lost it because of this vicious weed cycle.

If you're on the fence, just take 1 week off. Not 1 month, not 6 months, not 1 year, just 1 week. Then, at the end of the week, on Sunday, you can have a celebratory weed session, like I did last night. I thought I would enjoy that session, that high, but I did not. I woke up groggy again today, brain not as sharp, and I cannot f\*\*\*ing believe that this state that I am currently in, brain fog, no clarity, no energy, became my norm...for 3 years. I'm pretty sure I just lit up my last joint, and you can too. Just 1 week and see how you feel.

First reddit post and maybe my last, but I needed to post this. I hope just 1 person reads this, and tries it out, and escapes this vicious cycle. It's possible I promise you, I loved weed more than anyone I've met and I can't believe I did not enjoy it last night, in fact I hated it. Good luck and have a good **week.**",12

My state-tested thc pen was getting to be $70 a pop for 1 gram. That only lasted me a week TOPS. I work landscaping so I basically use weed as a numbing agent to bust out some work and make it to my 60 hour paycheck at the end of the week. I realized already that I depend on substance to feel better 100%. If I'm tired I NEED caffeine to fix it. If I'm in a shit mood or bored, I smoke.

I started writing these words cuz i think i'm going crazy right fuckin' now. sry for my weak English but I really needed to talk with someone and who is better than guys in r/leaves. at least you understand me guys.

My story:

I'm 25. I've been smoking weed for 8 years without any rest, for multiple times in day (3-4g/d)

I smoked cigarette for 7 years too. but 40 days ago, i quited that shit. i hate cigarette even when i started to smoke 7 years ago.

and that was not really hard to me. for first 2 weeks, i was thinking about that sometimes. but I controlled myself all that times. and I have no crave  about cigarettes right now

let's go to the main part. at first, I think I must say it, I LOVE WEED. I'M IN LOVE WITH THAT BITCH. but I should quit, cuz of so many reasons.

1) It's so expensive. I have good job and good income but I can't handle that. I spend all of my money for weed. no matter how much was my income. sometimes I spend more than my income and fucked my backup money

2) I can't even enjoy it. I know that I abuse it every time, but I love it. :( I can't work without weed. I smoked before my work, after my lunch, and then I went to home to smoke more :\\ I know this is a fuckin' contradiction. but what should I do.

3) I think I lost so many things cuz of it. my love left me alone cuz I have no enough time for her. some of my friend left me too cuz I wanted to smoke all the time and they didn't like that. ((here, I should say I found real friends with weed. and when I say real friends, I mean it. they support me every time even when they disagree with me. but I'm thinking about my old friends and my love. it's right that I found many friends, but what should about my love!!! :( ))

4) last week,I was high as fuck, and I felt I had heartbeat and couldn't breath well. (I feel it now sometimes but less than before(It's my third day)) and I was like: ""It's okey buddy, It's normal, you smoked weed"". but that was going to be continued and I scared as fuck. I think I fucked my lung, my heart, and my fucking mind.

5) I can't communicate with people. I think they don't like me. why should they like an asshole person who is high all the fuckin' time and don't like to spend time with them? I can't even communicate well with my family (maybe cuz I hate them) ((I HATE EVERYONE and it's not a good thing, you know?))

and more reasons. but these are important reasons

ok. it's my third day. first day was so fucking hard but not like now. I was so busy at work and after that, I went to home, was so hard but I did some workout and had a hot shower and went to sleep (i have no problem with my sleep at first night)

in the second day, I felt nothing (and it's surprised me because I thought that second day is so harder than first day)

&#x200B;

and now:

FUCK, I think withdrawals symptoms started from last night

I really need weed.

I'm at work from 3 hours ago and all I thinking about is weed

I can't slept well last night. I woke up every 30 minutes. my mind is foggy and it fucked me. I can't do my best at work. I think inside my head is like a tropical forest in autumn right now.

my body temperature is too high for a second so I feel like a volcano and I'll explode asap. and goes down for the next second so i feel like an ice mountain :|

I can't eat well. last night I was hungry as fuck but I didn't like to eat anything. I tried and our dinner was taste like a fucking rock (maybe rocks are more delicious than that)

at the I want to say, please pray for me. and I appreciate you cuz you waste your time for my fucking words

On the other hand, it is good to know I was a pain in the ass when I was constantly high, one more great reason to never smoke again. But it made me sad and embarassed, feeling really bad and awkward.",21

Has worked wonders for me. I'm lucky to have a pool near work and manage to swim on my lunch break. Has helped massively to; squeeze in exercise during the day, tire me out so I'm ready to sleep at the right time in the evening, and relieve all sorts of stress whether from work/people. 

I leave the pool with a clear mind and feel great. Added bonus that you can do this every day and not get too sore. The therapeutic benefits of swimming are huge. Forced breathing at the right times, general full body workout, accessible for all fitness levels and just being in the water will help keep your mind healthy.",27

2019-11-04 01:39:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/drdumx/day_5_feeling_good_slight_relapse/,"Day 5, feeling good. ('Slight' relapse 😂)","Hey guys, hope you had a good weekend and have been able to stay clean!

Earlier I posted the story of ""How I started smoking & How I'm going to quit"", right now I'm on day 5 of not smoking weed and I thought I should give an update on how it's going for me right now.

In the first 3 days I still had some cravings, but they weren't too bad and I was able to keep them in check. 

However, even though I said this is day 5 for me, I did have a small relapse saturdaynight, I went out for dinner with some friends, we were drinking a lot of beer and after dinner we went out to a bar, so more drinking, obviously. I was pretty drunk and on my way to the busstop I was going to pass the coffeeshop I always go to. I thought, might aswell just wait here until the bus arrives. 
So I went in and of course after about 5 minutes I was like ""Oh, what the hell, I'm drunk anyway and smoking a joint used to help prevent the headache next morning, so I might aswell roll one."" 
And so I bought half a gram of light weed and threw it all in one joint, smoked about a third of the joint and then I thought; ""What the hell, this feeling isn't even that nice (probably because I was pretty drunk already) and this weed tastes like shit."" Of course, instant regret and so I left the coffeeshop, put the joint in a plastic container and threw it out near a spot where homeless people always hang around, so maybe some homeless dude has a nice evening and that way I felt like I didn't completely waste my money.

The next day I felt like shit, because of the booze, but I didn't have any cravings or anything.

In my previous post I also said that I would avoid the coffeeshop for the first 2 weeks, but I get bored fast when I'm home and so in the last 4 days I went to the coffeeshop twice (not counting that time I was drunk) for a couple of hours, just to chill and have a chat with the people there.
Didn't have any cravings for the time I was there, I thought it would be really hard for me to sit there without smoking any weed, but apparently, it's not. I did have a bit of a mindset shift after watching a lecture on Marcus Aurelius on YouTube, that my brother sent me. That put some things into a different perspective for me.

I noticed that talking to the people around you about it (and also this subreddit) really helps become more self-aware and gives me confidence that I can keep this up. Also being grateful the things that you do have really does help.

Also, because I needed something else to do, I'm going to do a course on boxing, so I learn to defend myself and am able to get the agression out.


Side effects aren't too bad, just the waking up in a sweat-soaked bed isn't the nicest thing 😂.

2019-11-03 19:23:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dr9fgz/round_2_no_leaves_my_story/,Round 2 No Leaves My Story,"Hi All, 

Three years ago I attempted to quit leaves. I made it to day 56 and ended up smoking again. My attitude about the whole situation was bad because I was forced to stop smoking due to having really bad pneumonia. My desire to quit wasn't strong enough, so when I had mostly recovered and the opportunity arose at a club, I gladly smoked and wrote a post about how it felt just the same as before. 

I attempted to smoke only once every two weeks for awhile. I was successful for a few months but then I started smoking more and more frequently again and before I knew it I was smoking every day again! 

I would try on and off to have edibles instead of actually smoking or vaping. I have asthma, so reluctantly I try not to smoke anything but smoking a J was always my preferred method. 

At some point I decided to do a big clear out of my 'fun drawer' where I kept all my supplies. I threw away my bong, pipes, bubbler in order to prevent myself from the harsher smoke in my lungs. 

I got super into tinctures and edibles and would basically get home from work and eat an edible at 5pm, have some wine and be right toasted for the rest of the evening. 

More and more I realized I was literally doing nothing with my time and numbing out way too much. I needed to stop. 

So today I am over two months free of leaves (as well as alcohol). 

I finally did a clean up of my supply drawer yesterday and it definitely gave me some light cravings but it was a really important step to really throw away all these things I held on such a high pedestal. 

Confession - I kept a small kit bag .... with my grinder, some papers, one bottle of tincture that's pretty full. Oh ya and there's some gummies still in my freezer...

I don't know why I want to keep this... I think a part of me is still holding on to the past because some of those high times were great times. A part of me doesn't want this stuff to go to waste either. Ultimately though, it just isn't' for me anymore.

Thanks for reading.

What finally broke the cycle?,"I started smoking every day when I was 16, and have continued regularly until now. I am 22. It has been 6 years. I have a receding gumline. My memory is horrible. I can barely focus anymore and I am seriously struggling in school. I've been reading all these studies about how cannabinoids have detrimental effects on brain development if you start in adolescence, and the cognitive damage is never reversed. Ever. I fucked myself up. I'm not as smart as I could've been if I hadn't started in the first place. I will never reach my full potential because I prioritized short-term comfort over my long-term health. And back then, I didn't even care. I just kept on doing it because it was the only way I knew how to function when I was growing up. I grew up in a very tense household, and I was a tightly wound ball of anxiety before I started smoking. It let me function. But I never learned how to properly cope with that stress. My brain is maladapted because I never developed proper coping mechanisms. And I can't undo that damage. It makes me start to think whether it's worth stopping at all because of all the damage I've done. I know I should, and I know I need to, but summoning the motivation is so hard to do. 

&#x200B;

I've cut back a lot since my peak last year. I was high for 7 months straight. At the end of all that, I was a shell of my former self. I was having panic attacks multiple times a day. I was so sick of myself and I just wanted to die but I didn't have the motivation to go and kill myself. It was a truly miserable existence. I cut back a lot over the summer. At the beginning of the school year, I was smoking three times a week. Then it slowly crept up to 4. Then 5. Now it is back up to every night before I go to bed. The craziest part is that I don't even like it anymore. I wake up in the morning and I tell myself that today is the day I finally stop. Then, over the course of the day, I slowly convince myself that tonight isn't the right night to stop, and that one more day won't hurt considering it has been 6 years. Then after I get high, I just feel bad about myself. I get more anxiety, and I tell myself that I really need to stop. I go to bed fully convinced it was the last time, every fucking night. Then the next day, I'm right back in the same place I was the day before. It's a sickness. I'm making myself sick and I don't know how to stop. I've been reading all the posts on here and I am so envious of what everyone else has done, because I can't bring myself to do it. And then I realize how badly it has fucked me up and I just can't cope with what I've done to myself. So I smoke more to deal with that guilt, just to forget about it for a while. It also doesn't help that my housemate sells, so it's always around me in large quantities and I smoke for practically free. The only way I have managed to stop in the past is by telling myself it is only going to be a short break, or that I am just ""cutting back"". Even that took a considerable amount of willpower. After 2 or 3 days, I'm convinced I will never go back. Then a week later, I am back, telling myself that I can handle moderation. But I never can. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how much longer I can keep going in this cycle. I'm fucking exhausted. I'm sick of it, but I can't break free. So my question for you guys at the end of all this is where it turned around for you guys. What motivated you to finally break out of the negative cycle? What was your thought process on day 1? How did you get through it? Any comments here will be greatly appreciated. I'm desperate here, please help me.",7

I went and it was fine even though I was awkward, but after I got home I had a severe rush of adrenaline from my social anxiety and my thoughts started swirling and overanalyzing all my interactions and I immediately had the urge to smoke to ""come down"" and rid myself of this post social event anxiety I'm now having.

As the title suggests, I'm having a hard time finding the motivation to do anything. I've always been the kind of person who will get shit done if someone else is relying on me, but have basically zero willpower when it comes to self improvement or long-term goals


I feel like my weed usage has exacerbated this problem and my drive to do anything besides sit in my room and play games is at an all-time low. I did finally quit smoking cigarettes, but it's been real touch-and-go with marijuana. 


My situation right now is one where I'm fairly isolated from friends, and it's frustrating to me how it's much easier to be high than be lonely or bored. I'm moving in a little over a month, and I keep telling myself ""Oh, I'll quit then, because I'll be in a better environment,"" but I know that's just a lie to myself and an excuse to keep smoking. 


I keep quitting, but lack the willpower to dive into a hobby to distract myself, so I get sucked back in due to boredom. I feel like I'm stuck in a loop, where I know that my continued marijuana usage is detrimental to my goals and adult life, but I can't seem to shake it.


I almost feel as though something in my brain has been damage or knocked out of place, but I don't know if there's any science to that, nor have I been smoking weed particularly long. It just feels so difficult to shake the mental fog.


Not much else to say, thanks for anyone who reads this incoherent mess, all I'm looking for really is some anecdotes from people who have been in similar situations. Maybe a word of support. I dunno, I have nowhere else to post something like this.",7

I want to take this time to say that if you smoke weed to cope with life and there are underlying mental health issues that are your foundation and you have to have a strong foundation. 

  I don't know if this will help anyone but this was my experience and remember to take it one day at a time Rome was not built in a day as cheesy as it sounds.

I started when I initially said I was going to quit. Well, that lasted about three weeks, then slipped back into my old habbits...  

I've been an all day, everyday smoker for the past 6 years. Just like many others (who's threads I've read), it's a bitch of a habit to break. It's been my coping mechanism since I started.. everytime I feel stressed, anxious, worried, sad, pissed, etc. I'll reach for my piece and light up until I feel numb. I am fully functional when flying high, but I'm tired. Tired of feeling numb, tired of feeling as if I don't know who I am any longer, tired of the disgusting feeling the act of smoking itself makes me feel. Tired of not remembering my dreams at night. And honestly, tired of spending so much money to feel LESS of myself.. 

Today this comes to an end.. I'm graduating in 6 weeks and will be looking for a job soon. I figure this is the best excuse and motivation as any, to start looking for an ""adult"" job. I joined a gym yesterday (stopped working out around the time I started smoking, been missing those benefits and effects for years now. Just haven't had the motivation to join) and am excited to start doing the things I REMEMBER enjoying. 

I just finished my last bit of flower and I feel at peace with myself and the decision to do it and stick with it... I'm packing up my bong and rig to put into storage so it's out of mind and out of reach. 

I don't really have much of a point to any of this, other than the accountability to hold myself to this goal. I sincerely wish all of those on this journey and who are considering it the best of luck. Thank you for your time and let's get it errbody!",4

Later I have a Halloween party and all I can think about is how it's going to suck to be sober there. 

I would have relapsed already but I threw out all my weed stuff, thanks to all your dumb fucking suggestions. And I want to relapse so bad. I'm a 5 minute drive and $20 from being high and the only reason I'm not is because my wife would judge me. If I had any weed right now I'd smoke it without even thinking.

I hate that I have all these feelings. I hate that I've become so addicted to weed that 1 day without it feels this shitty. Fuck addiction. Fuck feelings. Fuck all of you for pushing me into this. I hope this gets better, or I won't last.

As I said I’m 7 months sober and my life has improved dramatically. I’ve truly never been this stable and content before. However, recently I haven’t been so good about making my sobriety a top priority compared to when I first got sober. I haven’t been going to as many meetings etc. So yesterday I go to a meeting where I talk about how I’m getting sloppy with my sobriety and need to refocus myself. I’m walking out of the meeting to the subway and I feel this hard thing in my pocket. I haven’t worn this jacket since last winter. I pull it out and it’s a weed pen (weed was my drug of choice). I was in shock. I haven’t touched a weed pen in 7 months. A devil voice in my head tells me to check and see if it’s charged. I press the button and it is. I had the thought like wow just take a puff, take a hit. I immediately called a sober friend who told me to throw it out. I went to a trash can and held it over the trash. I literally couldn’t let it go. Finally, I did. But then as I was walking into the subway station, I had a wave of regret and thought, “you should go back to the trash and get it” HOW DISGUSTING. Like first of all, I would’ve looked crazy rummaging through a trash can and second of all, that’s gross. I’ve talked about it with many friends and they’re all proud of me for throwing it out. But it was scary that it was so hard to let go of. It reminds me that we are always so close to relapsing and sobriety is so fragile. I cannot believe I was able to throw it out without taking a hit. If I can do that, anything is possible. Love this sub. Thanks for reading.",371

I have been stuck , I really didn't get into smoking heavy until me and my ex of over 4 years broke up and I lost so many relationships and friends from that, that my only ""friends"" were people I worked with and working in the restaurant industry... you work with some characters to say the least....

I realized the people I would hangout with were nothing like I wanted to be.. we had nothing in common but weed, we had no meaningful conversations or a connection... unless there was weed involved. 

After losing someone you talked to all day everyday and would think about 24/7 I was lost, I was afraid, afraid of being alone, afraid of my own thoughts and getting so caught up in my own head, afraid of being left out.

But being alone was the best part. I learned so much about myself, what I really liked to do, what im good at, what im not good at, but I always felt like I could do more, but didn't know what was holding me back.

I became so comfortable with weed and just saying ""its okay just once"" but when you say that everyday there is a problem . 

Don't get me wrong weed is an incredible thing for certain people and situations, but I abused it.. consistently.

I have tried stopping multiple times but always got pulled back in.... It has not been long since I stopped, but I have no intention of going back.. I feel great.

I started reading a lot, watching tons of youtube videos and kept gathering all of this knowledge and ideas but never took action. It was all theory and I was still....

Growing a long to-do list and hardly getting anything done...

Getting distracted by social media, email, and news alerts...

Procrastinating on important tasks and projects...

Feeling like there's not enough time in a day...

And feeling stuck...

I learned it takes 21 days to build and break habits. Below I have put together 21 things that I believe if you started with 1 everyday and implemented every idea into action at the end of those 21 days you will be in a much better place.

If anyone wanted me to elaborate more on everything below or wanted to start on day 1 with me please ask!

One that I am not content with, but it is far better than being alone. It's not abusive or mean, it's just... not a good fit. We're both kind and gentle, so it'll never escalate to breaking up.

So I smoke to handle the disappointments and lack of change. But I've been smoking for 10+ years daily... this relationship is 3 years old, but I rely on smoking to take off the edge.

I want to quit, but I know quitting would force me to break up. And I know breaking up without weed would bring me back k to depression. I wish I had the social support that one could rely on, but I don't. 

It's rationalizing to not quit smoking. I know the things I need to do, but not how to get them done without falling apart.

Got any advice?

I failed an at home drug test this morning after 40 days clean. I just want to give up.,"I’ve doing been so much better without weed. I figured it would be fine to go to a party around smokers and not smoke, but it was blowing in my face. I didn’t get a contact high or anything but completely failed my at home pee test this morning after having weak negatives for a week.  (40 days clean from being a heavy heavy concentrate smoker) watching my levels go down has been a big self esteem boost and motivation for me to keep going. I also have to pass a drug test to get a job in a few weeks and feel so stupid. I know my life is better without it but I keep thinking “why not just start smoking again, you failure?” My quitting journey started with the need to pass a drug screen, but I’ve learned so much about myself in the process. I don’t feel like I need it anymore, but I’m so mad at myself. It was stupid to put myself in that situation in the first place, but my friends are great people who know I’m not smoking and were completely understanding. I just didn’t want to miss out :/ I feel like such an idiot I just want to self destruct. I feel like I might as well have just smoked last night. I know this is about way more than a drug test for me, and my quality of life has improved so much since quitting...but I have to pass this stupid test before I can start working. I am a single parent and REALLY need to start working. It’s really making me want to give up and ruin my entire career. I know I sound like a complete idiot, but I hate myself so much right now. I don’t know what to do anymore. I think I just inadvertently ruined my life.

2019-11-02 09:41:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dqkb7o/day_2_and_my_husband_left_me/,Day 2 and my husband left me,"Background: I started smoking occasionally at 19, and was smoking daily by 22. I’ve had periods of low usage, a few breaks, but nothing significant. I have come to realize that I have issues with substance abuse (pretty much weed and alcohol, but I can find a way to become addicted to just about anything) so I decided to quit. My husband also quit so he can start looking for a new job. We both experience withdrawals from quitting weed, so we knew to give each other space. 

Well, my husband got pissed at me (stupid fights about whether to let the baby cry it out, him sleeping on the couch and refusing to move to the bed when the kids and I were ready to start the day) and instead of just taking time to cool down, he packed a bag and told me he was leaving me. He said he didn’t know if he normally loved me, because we were always high, but right now he hates me. He called me a psychopath and made fun of me crying over him leaving. 

I kept saying this is not the time to make big decisions, but he didn’t care. He wouldn’t discuss it. He just left and said he’d be back for more things. We have obviously had issues in the past, but things have been pretty good for the past year and a half. I feel blindsided. 

Normally I would call a friend and immediately get high. I struggle to calm down and stop crying otherwise. But not this time. For one, I made this promise to myself, for my kids, and I am determined to stick to this. For two, it’s exactly what my husband expects and probably even wants me to do—he seems to revel in my failures when he’s like this. And for three, if this really goes to divorce, I need to be above reproach.  

So I am not smoking. I took a dropper of CBD oil to ease the extreme nausea I get but that’s it. I am so sad. I want relief, but I know that the weed would only make me feel guilty, and paranoid and like a failure. I will not smoke. 

But damn, this is a hell of a thing to deal with on day 2.

We can usually tell that it's worth it, being more clear headed and having more motivation.

Still, we may feel strong anxiety, depression, and irritability. I've even felt light suicidal thoughts. Other than maybe anxiety, I never saw these problems in me before smoking. It's important to recognize that if sobriety sucks, you gotta just keep going. Relapsing will ultimately dig you deeper in this hole of negative feeling.

We need to think about quitting weed like regularly exercising. Many people struggle to do it. It takes a lot of work and discipline. It has many benefits. Basically, it's hard, only a few ever do it consistently, but it is massively beneficial. Just like with quitting weed, exercise is not an all in one solution. You will have to eat well, sleep well, and exercise properly to see results. With quitting, you need to rebuild old habits, go outside your comfort zone, and make connections.

This is the way to quit weed:

• get rid of all paraphernalia
• commit to not smoking everyday in the morning
• if you get cravings, allow yourself to feel them and breathe them though until they're gone
• if you are considering smoking again, there is certainly a voice in your head somewhere telling you you shouldn't. Listen to them. Always remember to make the harder decision: abstain. There's a part of you that knows this is the better choice. I recommend writing a list of all quitting benefits so you can look at it in moments of weakness.",184

I think I'm into the paws stage now and I've graduated from the initial withdrawal symptoms. Lucky me 😁

How's everyone else who's graduated from the initial withdrawal symptoms doing? I'm keen to hear your thoughts!

I have significantly cut back when I'm home, however enough is enough and I need to stop completely. Its not for motivation or for ignoring my emotions (I reached a point where I let my emotions out even when high). It's predominantly because I have started to develop significant signs of psychosis. I hear voices now, I get strange urges, I think people can read my thoughts, everyone seems like they're going to kill me, and there is an ever growing disconnect from reality. I can't take it, and if I keep smoking I know something really awful will happen with a psychotic break. 

My addict voice is still strong, even though I know how awful it is that I want to keep smoking, it will keep trying to convince me.

My story for those interested (or skip to TODAY) :-

Last 2 years - Got introduced to marijuana for the first time in college, and smoked almost everytime someone offered me, so around once every three weeks on an average. Sometimes it would be months before I smoke, occasionally continuous days. Good life, didn't think about it much and just enjoyed life and doing well, working hard for my passion. 

This year - 
June and July - Graduated, and decided to travel. Met many amazing people from all over the world, lived in mountains all of this month in a yoga hippie village. Everyone used to smoke marijuana there all the time even publicly as there was no police. It didn't need any, I guess but also it was so common there that I guess the police or government just didn't care at all. Anyway, I started smoking all the time since I had no reservations towards smoking. It was a fun thing I did every now and then, and now that I was traveling, I didn't mind at all induldging in it as it's vacation. Smoking everyday around 7-8 joints. Enjoying life and it didn't cause any problems because I had nothing to do but travel, chill and have fun. 

August - Still travelling but in another country so couldn't smoke pot. So I just switched to smoking cigarettes as I liked the feeling of smoking something when I'm alone or to have 'moments', you know? This month of not smoking pot, except 2-3 times all month- made me okay to smoking cigarettes, a lot. I was in company of people who smoked all the time and I still couldn't care much because hey, I'm traveling, right? I stop once I'm back to work. I am pursuing a career as a musician, I have big dreams and I wouldn't let anything become an impediment. So by the end of August, I was smoking as much as 15 cigarettes a day sometimes. 

1st Half of September - Still smoking, but also pot now. 
2nd Half of September - Done with traveling, back home, but still smoking now. This whole 3.5 months of traveling was so intense and when I smoked weed, I kept thinking of the blues. Feeling nostalgic and living in the past all the time. Reliving memories in my head all day while smoking and doing absolutely nothing in my home. Not even taking a shower most days. Felt like absolute shit drowning in my own misery but I liked it in a sadistic way. Smoking made me feel shittier than I did, and I love it. It made me feel really fucking lazy, disconnected from everyone, disconnected from reality and just missing emotions from the past all day. I should also mention I had a tough breakup while traveling with someone I thought I'd be with forever (lol), and another very nice fling so it was also from intense emotions about that. I didn't realize it then but it was marijuana which put me so deep into that state of just feeling the feels all day, and I thought I had no work to do but really I was too lazy to work and had no energy to get up or do anything. I was truly a lifeless piece of flesh and bones. I was convinced I could quit smoking any time (still am) and took sometimes a day off or set limits on number of cigarettes and always stick to them. But it definitely seemed hard until I had done it. 

October - I decided to set an objective date 10 days into future, until when I would not be smoking at all. It seemed really hard the first 1 day but it became easier but sometimes I had some craving- and I noticed I really started eating a lot. Not even when I'm hungry, I just started eating a lot to pass the boredom. I realized it was an effect of quitting smoking. It wasn't very hard to quite, but certainly hard but easier than what I thought it would be the day I was deciding to quit. I did the 10 days successfully. Every day was one day at a time, and I felt so much clearer about my thoughts, started being productive, realizing what I missed while smoking, my confusion and anxiety went away completely a few days into it. I was suprised because I also never felt any confusion in general or anxiety before I started smoking. Those 10 days were the happiest I'd been that month. Feeling happy, active, joyful, productive all the time, and started feeling like I never want to smoke anything again. 10 days got over, and I almost didn't want to smoke again, but I thought it was fine occasionally and smoked again once. Twice. And I'm not kidding, but next 20 days passed by like this. I was still productive sometimes, learning the lesson from those 10 days and kept smoking under control, usually to once or twice a day normally. But most days when I smoked in the morning, all my day went by just being lazy and smoking. I made rule to never smoke in morning so I could get work done. But last 2-3 days I haven't been following it but still being productive and practicing my instrument all day (as planned). I've gotten more serious about my instrument last days as I've reduced smoking, and start realizing how important time is and how I need to work hard for my dreams.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOVEMBER 1st, TODAY - Practiced all day and had a performance. Didn't go too well and I was upset at night, swearing to practice more and become a great musician. I had been realizing lately that smoking is not so good for a flute player (who would have guessed?) and I really want to stop everything that stops me from achieving my goal now.

So I just had smoked up at night after being sad about today's performance infront of my teacher, talking to two of my best friends telling them about today's performance and my desire to improve. Both of them had been pot smokers earlier but had now left it, and were happy about it. Funnily, both said the same thing, that I need to quit smoking. I was a little defensive and made excuses but I can't fool myself. I told them in the end that I would quit soon. I didn't really plan to though and didn't want to think about it. 

Then I was reading a post here about how people changed their lives for better, and someone mentioned quitting pot in their list. I was curious because I had been realizing slowly the same, that pot wasn't good for me. I started reading comments and someone linked to r/leaves and I wanted to read more, maybe subconsciously to gather courage and motivation. I came here, ten minutes into reading this subreddit, I realized ""Yeah, I forgot how amazing it was to not smoke at all! I need to sort my life again and I know smoking is a big part of it for messing it up."" I texted a friend who had quit smoking earlier and offered me motivation when I was on my 10 day hiatus last time. Recently he started smoking again and kept saying ""I'll stop it"". I texted him after this and asked him ""bro, when do you plan to quit?"". He said ""now"". And that's the moment I decided that yes, now. Spoke to him on call for a while and discussed how it had been becoming an impediment in living a joyful life. 

So, yes, bye bye to smoking now for me. Thank you guys for sharing your stories, it truly motivated me and I hope mine will motivate you aswell. I'm sure I'll quit smoking now. I can't just go back to smoking again after writing such a long post about how it fucked me up. :)

I wrote in my diary just now, some lessons I realized just now:
IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR LIFE, CHANGE IT, YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF AS YOUR CEO. 
Smoking takes away your mental energy because you keep thinking about it, and thinking about quitting it All your life you believe you can take and quit any small thing in your life, smoking makes your strength so low you start questioning yourself if a little roll of tobacco is stronger than you, what the fuck.

I feel so much better already, feeling so empowered. Guys, let's do it. Come quit with me, NOW. If you have been waiting for a sign, this is fucking it.",42

&#x200B;

The big reason as to why I'm stopping is to look for an new job after three years of mistreatment came to a head on monday morning. My $4k worth of tools being shoved under the stair case with the notion that a different technician will eventually take my bay over and leave me as a useless, bayless tech followed by a series verbal abuses that left me in the dark about my own future with the company. Totally feeling like Harry Potter in the cupboard under the stairs right now...

&#x200B;

  I did an interview yesterday full of anxiety about being drug tested and failing, leaving me barred from reapplying in the future. All I have to do is call a number to set up training, but guess who isn't ready to piss clean? And then received a call from a company offering me a position I've been dying to get into since I've realized that working the shop is not my cup of tea, I had to tell him the truth, I won't pass a hair follicle test for a long time. I didn't want to waste his time, only to be (once again) barred from applying due to my inability to stop smoking.

&#x200B;

But what happened today kind of scared the shit out of me. My big boss, (the dealership owner) came to me to explain everything going on. Telling me that they would like to see me stay and will go to great lengths to keep me around. As great as that sounds, I don't know if this setting is good for me. The moment I knew I could keep this job, my first thought was about going home and rolling up a fat ass blunt and just smoking on it til I can't see straight. My stress levels are through the roof, all I want to do is smoke, but if I do, it'll be the same shitty cycle at the same shitty job, and that is not what I want.

&#x200B;

Here's a little advice. Next time you want to take a hit, pack a bowl, roll a spliff, think about what you're giving up. This plant is almost in complete control of my life, where all I want to do is think about my next smoke sesh. Don't give in, I know I won't. My happiness, my future, and the prospect of better paying job are on the line and I will no longer be a slave to smoking. I would love to give in, more than anything right now, but I know I'm throwing away much more than just pissing clean. 

&#x200B;

I hope you all find the courage and resolve to achieve your goals. Don't let this leafy green be who you are, because it's not.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading",2

I’m on day 110 and still not feeling all that great. Don’t get me wrong, it’s way better now than it was a few months ago, but I still have moments where I’m a bit foggy and still have spiked anxiety levels during moments of stress (which is what all human beings experience - it’s just way worse than before I quit).

I’d like to think that eventually I’ll get back to “normal” again, which I’m not sure what that even means anymore. I guess I’m just frustrated that I don’t really feel any better. I actually think I’m way worse. I thought actually stopping smoking weed would be hard but it’s actually not been that hard. I don’t have any desire to smoke. But now I just don’t feel great and I’m wondering what the point of stopping was. I smoked every night. It helped me unwind. I definitely over did it because it started to make me super anxious and paranoid. I figured stopping would clear all of that up. 

I do all the right things. Exercise, sleep, meditation, see a therapist, a doctor. Long story short, I think I’m just frustrated that I don’t feel back to normal yet. 

Anyone get to this point and still feel just fucking “weird”. I smoked for 3 years every day. So maybe I’m busy being impatient.",8

We got really bad news that thieves who basically stole over $10,000 from me and my family are getting off scot-free. These were professional criminals to such an extent the LAPD and Citibank have no evidence to use against them due to the Enterprise encryption software they used. This DDOS software was so advanced, that even when we did get evidence of their transactions and showed it to the police and Citibank, they said the evidence was insufficient due to an unknown type of card and pin and declined our claim. These criminals were the best in the business. Also FUCK CITIBANK we obviously switched banks due to this.

That money would have fast-tracked my publishing career, now I can not publish my book until April 2020. In despair I fucked up big time and bought a quarter OZ of high-grade weed, telling myself I'd stretch it to next payday. Not even two nights later that quarter OZ was gone as I smoked it all, just wolfed it down as a professional pothead pig. Moderation just won't happen with me ever with Cannabis, not ever. I like it too much to have any self-control and the horror and self-loathing feelings those two nights were beyond description. I realize I had become everything I ever swore Id never become and somehow knew that once that quarter was gone, it would be my very last. I'm tired of being sick, and tired of not loving myself because I let Cannabis get in the way of all my dreams and aspirations. Not any lack of capability to achieve my dreams due to an excellent academic track record, but a severe lack of self-control that nearly destroyed me. I want to be the real me again, not this strung out shell I've become. I'm done.",21

What I have learned: I used to convince myself that pot helped me in certain ways, which I clearly see now wasn't the case. I was convinced it helped curb my anxiety. The truth is, it often exacerbated it. Both my depression and anxiety are under much better control now. I also am way more productive. The first couple weeks I was bored shitless, and thought, well, I need to find something to do. So, I started writing songs and am working on a solo album, and I am able to see projects through. I also think much clearer now and have better communication and comprehension skills. I really realize how dull I made my bran by being a stoner, like constantly losing my train of thought, or having trouble recalling even simple words. I also make more time for people and experiences now, and don't feel awkward in social situations like I used to. For me, it's been fairly easy, \*most\* of the times. However, I do have health issues, including chronic pain, and there are times my brain tries to convince me that weed will make it all better, or that I can get some and be able to pace myself; to just use it as medically needed. But in the past, there have been so many instances of me trying to pace myself, and within a month or two, it leads to me being stoned pretty much all the time. It will always be one day at a time for me. There are still times I don't know if I can keep it going, and I have had a couple close calls. In the past, I have had longer quitting periods than this, and I have gone back. I can only hope I will remain smart enough to keep this up. I was a stoner for the better part of over 25 years. If you want it enough, you can do it, but it won't always be easy. Congrats to all those that have remained weed-free, and to anyone reading this that is giving it a new try. You can totally do it.",196

Started smoking off and on at age 14 ... 18 years ago, and I really want to break the habit for good. Thinking back on my adolescence before weed I was incredibly anxious and depressed and weed did help ""chill me out"" and made it easier to interact with others/enjoy life.

That said - my new goal is to find ways to chill out, interact with others and enjoy life without weed but that requires a lot of change. I'm bipolar1 and have had horrible sleep these past 30 days ( been manic after lowering my meds, stressed out from moving to new state and isolated, lack of $, noisy neighbors) waking up in the middle of the night (nightmares, too much energy) and hard time to go back to sleep. 

I've noticed exercise is helpful but the days where I get four hours of sleep I have trouble motivating myself to do anything productive (meditating, exercise, reaching out). I'm still struggling with a lot of stress, joylessness so not seeing the anxiety/social problems alleviated but figure it will take some time, but have noticed a major dip in the enjoyment department.

Background:

I have smoked weed daily since I was about 14 (I'm almost 21 now). In this period I've hit several major existential slumps where I decided to put a stop, and it lasted me about a few months each time. The longest one was 8 months last year, where in the span of 2 weeks after flushing my weed I moved to another country to study and takeover my life, where I currently am.  


I won't go through all of the reasons for why I repeatedly decided weed is holding me back from so many things because I'm sure they are dug deep down in everyone taking a peek at this subreddit, but I do want to talk a bit about my experience with quasi-quitting it and an observation regarding to other stories I read online (and look forward to read in the comments if you will):  


Because it is a soft addiction, at least at first, that doesn't render the individual dysfunctional from the get go, it takes a while for even the thought that its having a negative effect to set in. More so, the negative effect itself and its post withdrawal symptoms are more subtle than in other cases. This means that while smoking weed or after quitting it, the barrier for reentry is minimal (alcohol has even worse exposure as its literally everywhere and everyone does it casually).  


Thing is, I quit for 8 months, and while the beginning is incredibly satisfying, because weed supresses you and your emotions and you start to replenish yourself after quitting, you realise it was just a fade on top of everything you have to actually solve and deal with. This usually makes you want to indulge again with the feeling of having control now, but you give that control away when you break the deal with your addiction.  


So, then I decided that if its not worth momentarily quitting, that I'll try do stuff and smoke weed (something very recent that I came across about myself is that I like myself more socially when in my smoking periods, I think this is because I'm so visceral when sober with my feelings as they are new that I find that off putting and prefer indifference (this annoys me)).

 it kinda works out, I do stuff, but you can  d e f i n i t e l y  feel how you are severely impairing yourself just for the reason of comfort, I know that I could do legit 5 times the amount of shit I do now, and that makes me feel embarassed of myself for choosing the easy, mediocre path out. I can function with weed but I also know what I'm capable of if I put myself out there and struggle, so being a lazy shithead feels bad. I also get severely anxious and guilty with the first joint of the day until I get high, so I'm probably in the makes for another major RESET very soon.  


While stories of quitting weed for a few months are great for empowering themselves and keeping discipline I want to hear about people who kicked weed's ass for good or incorporated it in their regime that they are still proud of themselves and honestly doing good (not financially, whatever good means for your soul and mind)

So the only symptom i can really think of still remaining that's obvious is very very mild night sweats. 

It's so mild that i didn't have to even change my t-shirt last night. 

Even though I'm nearly over the initial withdrawal symptoms i still feel the need to update daily. 

The reason being is that i don't want to take my sobriety for granted. 

For the last ten years I've got complacent in my recovery and always ended up relapsing time and time and time again. 

So this time I'm going to post and contribute to this community on a regular basis. 

To conclude here today. I want to acknowledge that i am an addict and the best i can ever hope for is for my disease to be in remission and for me to be in recovery for the rest of my life. 

I hope everyone is keeping their addictions at bay today? 

Thanks for reading again.

So I’ve decided to do things differently this month. I’ve set myself a challenge, naturenovember, where the aim is to go outside and appreciate the beauty of the natural world every day in November, sober. By not having all the focus and pressure on just giving up, and by rewarding myself sobriety by doing something I enjoy, I’m hoping this time is the last time. I feel ready, and excited to take my life off pause. 

There’a a quote I heard recently, “everybody has two lives, and the second begins when we realise we only have one life”. I want to start living again, and wake up from this zombie like state that I keep choosing to put myself in everyday. It’s time for me to move on, and see what life has to offer. I can’t expect external change to happen when I don’t change anything internal. Wish me luck guys, and if anyone else is thinking about trying naturenovember let me know !",3
