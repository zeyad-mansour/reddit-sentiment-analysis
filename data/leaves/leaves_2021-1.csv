Please Help,"Can I please get some advice on how to cope?... I feel so weird being sober after smoking -almost- daily for 10 years; and it seems like I have such a short fuse when sober.

I can't stop thinking about picking up and smoking, it's actually driving me nuts.

It's not fun anymore. It's not pleasurable. I just smoke and cough and eat a bag of hot cheetos and get super paranoid about benign social interactions. I wake up at 4am and can't get back to sleep. It leaves me feeling awful anymore.

I have no space for it in my life, either: I'm serving a volunteer term 40 hrs/week and just added a second site teaching an adult ESL class once a week; I'm a deacon in my church; I'm supposed to be studying for the LSAT; I'm recording a track with a folk duo I play with tomorrow morning; I want and need to get back in shape. There is just no way I can justify smoking anymore to myself, there is no way I can rightfully justify this awful coping mechanism. I'll smoke once and it fucks my sleep schedule for a week, and every other part of what little routine I have goes with it.

I've gone through too much to just surrender to getting high alone in my room watching BoJack Horseman for the 5th time and eating a bag of hot cheetos or a pint of ice cream because I feel stressed or anxious or whatever. I can list what I've worked through, what traumas I've overcome, the pits that I have climbed out of but it‚Äôs beside the point.

I feel like every time I smoke anymore my brain feels like applesauce the next day and the gears don't turn how they should; I slow down and I don't make connections like I do when sober.

It's beyond unsustainable, it's actively detrimental to the life I want to build. I want to finish my service term on a good note, I want to give my students the best I can give them, I want to work on a political campaign next year, I want to go to a good law school, I want to build a prosperous life. Pot will absolutely not help any of that happen, it's just going to make everything harder to achieve.

It's the final straw, that's it. I'm ready to really commit to actualizing these goals I've developed. And they're **my** goals too which makes the journey and sobriety more meaningful.

2021-01-30 23:43:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/l94r2y/severe_anxiety_and_barely_functioning/,Severe anxiety and barely functioning,"I come from a family riddled heavily with addiction. I keep beating myself up because I knew better than this, but here I am. I feel so ashamed for landing myself in this situation and can't seem to stop beating.myself up. My last smoke was 1am this morning, and I am promising myself that I will not touch it again.

I used to smoke recreationally on the odd occasion during my teens, once I had children I didn't touch it again unless I was in a lot of pain/sick. I left a very abusive relationship 5 years ago, began drinking and smoking occasionally on weekends, and because my digestive system is a mess the alcohol had to go very quickly so the weed became my crutch. The abuse from my ex intensified once I left him, and then I met my current partner who is a smoker, which intensified the drama's in my life with my ex further and smoking became a daily habit to cope.

I am autistic, ADHD and have PTSD, GAD and an eating disorder. Weed seemed to help so much initially, I felt more at ease in social situations and no one gave me shit for being quiet or weird, and if they did, I had another smoke to alleviate my discomfort.

Over the past 12 months or so I have been aware that I have a problem with it, I just cannot go a single night without it, otherwise the anxiety consumes me and my insomnia returns with a vengeance. Each time I raised my concerns with my partner, he wasn't able to relate, and he has always lovingly tried to reassure me that smoking is okay and not something I need to worry about. He sees it as, if it helps in the moment to alleviate things, then it mustn't be the weed. But there has never been a point in my life where my functioning levels have been this bad. I have very few friends and the closest ones I do have are all daily smokers who are in love with their herb. But the forgetfulness and the mess that is left behind after a sesh is something that now overwhelms and agitates me. I feel like I've lost control of the situation.

The cognitive impairment at the moment is intense. I am unable to focus on anything. I start heading into a meltdown the moment I attempt to do a task that requires any effort what so ever. My anxiety is causing me pain in my back, neck and legs and I know as it gets closer to bed time that this will worsen. I've been experiencing frequent anxiety attacks which are almost daily, yesterday was the worst as I had 3 in one afternoon, I wanted to feel comfortable so desperately that I smoked. I know this is a trap and yet I keep jumping into it. 

I sincerely apologise for the long post, my mind is a mess and I feel like I must defend my actions in some way. I just really want this to stop, and want to hear how long this generally lasts for others. 

Once stopping, how long does it usually take for anxiety to settle down to our pre-smoking levels?

Are headaches and blurred vision something that is pretty common while withdrawing? I experience it with anxiety but this feels so extreme.

I really want my energy, my hobbies, my health and my mind back. I don't feel like myself at the moment and would love to be able to organise my thoughts once again. I worry so much that I may have done permanent damage.

Also does anyone have any experience with speaking to partners and friends who really love their green? My partner is supportive of me taking a break but not quitting, he keeps saying ""once you've taken break we'll just smoke occasionally"", which turns into ""We'll still smoke weekends though"". He is wanting an MDMA sesh in the very near future and in the midst of all of this he has begun asking friends who would like to partake and asked me when would I be keen. I expressed my concerns for my mental health and just told him that I need to settle that first, I wasn't sure how else to respond to that situation right now without upsetting him.

Let‚Äôs fast forward now. I am 21 years old I quit smoking cigarettes a little over a year ago. Smoking weed never quit I had smoked it every day until I was 16 finally, I quit that‚Äôs when reality hit me and I found I hated weed. My brain was slower my grammar was bad I could tell compared to other people I was less developed in my brain, I was frustrated, depressed and I had no motivation for anything other then looking as close to everyone els as I could( in high school)  and trying to always consume my life with a girl friend that I poured more time into more then any video game or class paper or even friends for the matter):. My grades were horrid and I blamed it all on weed. When I said I quit, I quit for 2 weeks. I had horrible withdraws from cold sweats to not eating to night mares every night so bad I was terrified to even go to sleep. Well after that 2 weeks I broke down and smoked a blunt. And ever since then I have smoked everyday the past 5 years. Without a reason why till this day.

I quit drinking about a month ago which was pretty easy since I was still smoking, but Im realizing just stopping the drinking isn't enough. I figure ill just share my story to maybe shake something loose in my head for my sake. I started smoking and drinking heavily at the end of my senior year in high school (about 7 years ago now) after going through a bad romance that pretty much failed because of my drinking and smoking. that summer it was constant partying and the next year everyone went of to college I stayed home and let my habit get worse. I started living with my sister for a while and her BF at the time who was a heavy drinker and also sold weed so that was a bad situation all together. There is when to drinking started becoming bad and I also started mixing tobacco with my weed. after a falling out with my sister because I would constantly leave messes around the house, I moved back home with my Mom and now I've been living with her ever since. I've had a few jobs but never kept one for more than a year or so because I end up getting bored with it and calling in until I just wouldn't show up anymore. I was spending like 200 dollars a week on weed and buying hella shit online that I didn't need so I could never save up to move out or try and do something good for myself. I was always so angry and filled with guilt because I kept letting everyone down. Weed just made me not want to do anything. I would think ""why do anything else when I can just sit here and be high and forget everything"". I was really able to maintain this illusion that the drugs were fine for me and I was just stuck in a bad place for some other reason. at this point I've pretty much lost all my friends and alienated most of my family due to drinking and smoking. I have no job, no school I'm going to and no real goals now other than to try and get out of this so maybe I can start rebuilding a worth while life. I'm grateful for all the inspiring posts on here, I probably wouldn't have even made it this long without them so I will continue to come back here for as long as I need. It's so helpful to know that you're not alone in this.

I'm still experiencing the symptoms I had mentioned in my previous post, but to a much lesser degree, and they tend to wear off within the first \~2 hours of being awake. Peppermint Tums, tea, and applesauce have been my best friends for dealing with the nausea thus far. I'm still experiencing some brain fog and low motivation & energy, but I'm trying really hard to prioritize self-care and remember to focus only on staying sober while I'm in this vulnerable state.

I also opened up to my family doctor about my situation and have been temporarily prescribed some anxiety medication (I've been on it before and only take it when the anxiety is absolutely unbearable so I'm not worried about dependence), which will really help for when I go back to work on Monday, as I am agoraphobic and that was one of the things I was really stressed about. But I've been transparent with my boss about my health and I'm on reduced hours for now, so I'm feeling pretty optimistic about being able to slowly integrate myself with the public again.

I'm feeling very grateful for all the things I have right now. I'm grateful for my partner, who has been my rock throughout this journey and even stopped smoking in solidarity with me.

Today I was with a friend I smoked with for year's, and they advised telling more people when I'm more confident, but I couldn't be more confident. 

I always have, every attempt, every thought said I wouldn't make any grand statements, I feel like today I can. 

I'm on day five of both cigs and weed. Twelve years or so full-time smoker. In 2019, I halved my consumption and had 150 or so days sober, many consecutive days. Then in 2020, I went backwards to everyday smoking and more consumption. 

I knew I was going commit for months before taking action or talking it out with anyone, and I didn't know the exact day, so again I kept saying to myself make no grand statements. 

I acknowledge I can't gradually do it, and I don't want to. I have all the right conditions and support. Im seeing local COVID restrictions as a positive and not a reason to smoke. When will I ever have so much time to only focus on me and this process again? I know the possibilities of bad news, and I know that the last thing I will do is smoke. I see how negatively smoking was affecting my life.

It's hard to fully explain my frame of mind slowly changed with years of altering my relationship with it. I understand it will continue to be hard moving forward. I will continue to remember this: 

1.) I'm already talking more positively to myself as if by accident with no intent... When this happens not if

2.) I'm only responsible for me and my happiness right now

3.) It is an extremely tough experience, in the grand scheme this is a small amount of pain for a world of gains 

4.) I will always be an addict. From this point, I can be both an addict and a non-smoker 

5.) This group, family and friends are an amazing support network, and I will reach out if I need help

I recently quit alcohol as I made an extremely stupid decision one night while blackout drunk that caused a whole mess of problems.

It‚Äôs been extremely hard especially considering my roommates are drug dealers and are disrespectful about it too, smoking openly in the living room, keeping jars of weed out in plain sight etc. Not to mention always drinking as well.  I need to move out soon however it‚Äôs complicated because they are also my best friends and they rely on my rent money. 

But to get to the heart of the story, I know crazy dreams are normal while quitting smoking weed/ dabs, however mine are INSANE. Every single one of my intense dreams are about my life while awake, it‚Äôs almost like lucid dreaming in a way? I‚Äôm going through a breakup on top of this and all of my dreams are about my relationship (or lack there of) and my job. It‚Äôs insane. Sometimes the environments are different but all of the people in them are real even if I haven‚Äôt seen or heard from these people in ages.

No call no shows, get fired, lose my apartment, car, everything and move back home. I repeated this cycle for 4 years, until I almost did it again last March. After 4 months of dabbing 24/7 (would always buy the highest percent THC carts and dab at work), almost losing my job, being hospitalized for being a neurotic, suicidal mess, and fuckin up all my relationships, yet again.

I‚Äôve been struggling for some time now and it truly is getting hard to see any light at the end of this tunnel.    

I‚Äôm 30 years old.  One year ago I was busted with a couple different drugs, but marijuana has been the main destructive force in my life.  I was one year from graduating medical school, in a position to specialize in my dream field.  I was not arrested but made the mistake of telling my school.  I anticipated charges being filed and falsely assumed they‚Äôd  be able to find out.  I was consequently thrust into an impaired professionals/physicians program.  I was forced to go to a rehab for 10 weeks and sign a 5 year monitoring contract that will drastically alter my career choices.  In addition the school is requiring me to take two years off before returning despite the rehab giving me the green light and charges being dropped.  

I was a very, very heavy pot smoker for the last two years and it cost me my best friend and girlfriend of almost three years.  I broke up with her without giving her a real reason due to my insecurity and inability to tell her that I had been getting high everyday over the last year of our relationship (which had become long distance hence how I was able to hide it).  She visited me one last time and I looked her in the eyes and shattered her heart, choosing weed and hedonism over her.  After reflecting, I acknowledged I had many addictive tendencies throughout my life: Isolation, dishonesty, narcissism, manipulation, process addictions, etc.  I moved back in with my mother and stepfather, adding extra strain on them and their very limited finances.  I see a counselor weekly, go to meetings, and see a pastor for spiritual guidance.  I also picked up a job landscaping to make ends meet.  

At this point I feel hopeless and think about suicide most days.  I‚Äôve looked at ways to make carbon monoxide and spent time trying to rationalize and morally justify suicide.  Thinking about the destruction I would leave behind gives me pause.  My mother and step father would be ruined as would my dog - he is one of the only things that brings me joy now.  I speak with my counselor and friends about this stuff but not to this detail - I‚Äôd like to avoid involuntary medical detainment.  I constantly think about the mistakes and harm I‚Äôve caused, my crushing amount of debt, and future career and family prospects.  I am grateful for the life I‚Äôve lived thus far.  I‚Äôve been fortunate to travel and live many places, study at prestigious institutions, and meet wonderful people I can call friends.  But it sometimes feels like this is all the more reason to be content in leaving early.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I hope this post is beneficial if not for me, for someone else.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6723018}"

It was a struggle sometimes. It seemed pointless and hopeless, especially while I tried to unfuck my life, and especially for the first year or so. But it got better, it got easier, and it didn't take forever.

There's a thousand tiny things that go into a success story, especially the people who help along the way. One thing that sticks out for me was a truth I adopted near the start of my journey. I told myself: **""Every day I stay clean, I get better. Even if I can't see it. Even if it seems like I'm getting worse.""** I'm no fan of ""The Secret"", but this convenient truth worked for me.

Most of the time, I couldn't see any progress.  Fuck, I *was* worse some days -- taking things personally, being inconsiderate, holding grudges, and having feelings I didn't know how to deal with because for 10 years the only feelings I had were the ones I wanted to have.

Anyways, it was hard, it was easy, and it was every place in between. It's not over, either. Here's how I spent the Trump presidency:

After the first week, I had money in my wallet the night before payday.   

>!But instead of sleeping, I would just sweat. And the temper tantrums were terrible!!<

After the first month, I was finally sleeping. 

>!But the dreams, man, those vivid dreams! I'd completely forgotten about night-movies!!<

>!And I was dreaming of actually doing something with my life again.!<

After eight months, I finished school. 

>!But it still felt like those dreams would never come true.!<

After a year, I started my career. 

>!But I was afraid they'd find out I was a fraud and incompetent and a terrible person.!<

After two years, my life was starting to come together. 

>!And I was sure it was all about to collapse. Because that's what life does.!<

After three years, I got my dream job.

>!And I thought, holy fuck, people are trusting me to do this?!<

After three years and seven months, I became a father. 

>!And I thought, holy fuck, I can't believe they basically let anyone do this, I definitely can't do this.!<

And after four years I think I might be ""hitting my stride"". 

>!OK, I still have self-doubt, but I'm okay with that.!<

I've got more important things to do with my life, and my life is too important to fuck around with. I don't smoke cigarettes or vape any more, I run three times a week, and I'm in love with my little girl who is basically perfect. I'm glad I get to remember every minute I spend with her.

I tried quitting last week for the first time in 10 or so years.  The withdrawal symptoms were extremely hard, and I went back to the green after a few days. I'm interested what the community's thoughts are about drawing down/moderating use before quitting?  I'm smoking ~7g/week and I think I could get myself to half of that before quitting.  If moderating before abstaining is a viable strategy, what kind of time frame should I plan for?  Is a week of moderation enough for the withdrawal symptoms to lessen?

I'm nervous that this thought is my subconscious tempting me to say, ""tomorrow, not today"", but I'm also nervous that, if I've made quitting harder than it has to be, I might not quit again if my next time fails.

I quit for ~1.5 years when my job required testing.  It was strange, as soon as I knew I had a drug test coming up I dropped the pot and didn't even have a craving or withdrawal after that.  Also never been a problem to wait until after work to get high.  Being formerly in the restaurant industry, my day is pretty unstructured and I'm filling all that space with weed.

I smoked in college because everyone in my circle did, eventually when I lived alone and had a dealer it became a constant habit where I would blow off class or friends to stay home and get high. By my senior year I had more obligations and became more of a ""functional stoner"" which has carried over into my post-grad life for the past 3 years. I've justified my addiction in so many ways, constant mental gymnastics. ""I have a full time job, I work out, I have an active social life, I have my shit together, I don't really drink, all my friends smoke, I need it to help with my anxiety, it helps me be creative/enjoy music/etc"". Over time those excuses started losing value as I noticed that I just kept slipping further and further away from my past self. My happiness didn't feel as authentic. I was rarely fully sober (either high or weed-hungover and foggy), and the occasions where I had to be sober were tough. I would stop replying to people or would leave hangouts early to smoke alone. I abandoned hobbies and projects and never had enough of an attention span to complete a show or book or video game.

When COVID hit, it gave me a whole new justification for smoking: we're in a pandemic! there's nothing to do! Also I had a super toxic job that made me miserable so justifying smoking was easier than ever. My use skyrocketed to nearly all day, every day. But things changed recently - I got an incredible new job, like so much better than any place I've ever worked. I got a gym membership, I have an awesome new relationship, it just sort of feels like my life is moving on around me but I'm still being held back by this addiction. I read Quitting Weed and Atomic Habits and really realized once and for all that the change is necessary even if it's incredibly tough at first. So this is it, folks. Not buying weed today (the first time in years where I will be dankrupt by choice). I'm going to sit with the boredom and read books and dream again and just be present in the world around me. It's going to be tough as hell but it's time. It's necessary. I'm ready to rediscover myself, to live, to feel, to thrive again.

I used cannabis to self-medicate anxiety and other mental health issues. I've since been diagnosed with PTSD by a psychiatrist, and my therapist suspects a more severe dissociative disorder stemming from childhood trauma. I've been dissociative since I was a teenager, many years before starting to use cannabis. I used cannabis daily for 7-8 years-ish after a year of occasional use.

The weird thing is, that every time I quit cannabis again, I get more dissociative. This is counter-intuitive to me, as much of what I've read about cannabis is that it increases dissociative symptoms like depersonalization and derealization. I even had a friend who would also complain about high-thc weed making him more dissociative and then he was less dissociative when he was forced to take breaks, but he kept using despite this so I cut ties for now.

I just find it weird and kind of difficult to deal with. It's like when I'm sober, I still can't ""deal"" with emotions, but since I'm not getting high anymore, my brain resorts to what it knows and I am just way more dissociative, my memory gets spotty, I forget to eat, I feel confused about when/where I am, my work gets done but I don't remember doing it. It's especially worst in stressful times and I am going through a busy time with work these days.

Does anyone else struggle with this? Do you have any tips that help? I try to feel more grounded and I have a couple fidget things that help a bit, but it's still a significant challenge for me and it has led me to relapse in the past.

There's this saying I find helpful: the opposite of addiction isn't sobriety, it's connection

Now I'm aware of this, I have been working towards connection. But it's hard to feel connected when I'm dissociating all the time. I will bring it up to my next therapy session, but just wondering if anyone can relate or has insight in the meantime.

It‚Äôs been two weeks since I quit and the first couple of days I would notice little urges before I start a new show or movie, dreading that I wouldn‚Äôt have the patience to sit through anything without weed.

But here‚Äôs my trick to build up my focus and although it‚Äôs been slow, everyday my focus gets better and more fun to practice: giving my focus as a gift to someone

It sounds crazy but I‚Äôll watch my little brother play video games for hours because I know it‚Äôll make him happy. Or if he wants me to watch a new show, I‚Äôll watch an episode or two for him. I‚Äôll push my focus like a muscle and see how far I can go for a day.

I don‚Äôt know why this helps me so much but I suspect being of service to someone I care about somehow reciprocates my own healing. It gives me a destination, a goal.

The withdrawal symptoms have died down but my craving to smoke is WAY up today. That little devil in my brain keeps going ""Oh, just a hit won't hurt you, it won't set your progress back THAT much."" But I know it will, so I'm staying strong. 

This is the first time in a LONG time that I've been clean for several days in a row. Sometimes I wonder how I'm going to make it through it, and I'm kind of feeling like that right now. But this feeling won't last forever, and definitely won't last as long as the shame I'll feel if I give in.

It's hard to explain to people that you have an ""addiction"" to the ""safest drug in the world""; especially with all the propaganda around.

I smoked my first joint when I was 11 and I turned 28 in October.
Time flies and i want to get on with my life...

Reaching this age makes me think differently about my future, I want to be in a more than good place financially, find a beautiful wife to raise a happy family with.
And that goal is not reachable when i'm smoking three joints consecutively every fucking night until i can literally pass out while watching YouTube videos.

I have had sleeping problems for as long as i can remember, so when I found weed and found out about indica strains I was all for that shit! Perfect, it's moderately cheap and I can sleep for 8 hours... or 12.

Since I chose to quit i got a prescription for a sleeping aid from my doctor that i can use while the symptoms are running amok.

I also downloaded the Quit Weed app from the appstore. Every person who is trying to quit weed should get that app! I can't stress it enought. It guides you, keeps track on things like money you save and a timer from the day you quit among many other cool features. This is not a commercial for it, I have just found it incredibly helpful!

So, I want to thank all of you who posted and commented on the posts in the sub.
You played a part in inspiring me to take the final and dreadful step I knew I had to take some day.

I will keep scrolling and maybe post updates and hopefully inspire others to keep fighting the urge to smoke ""just once"".

Life happened and I started depending on it more as an emotional crutch to help e with my mental health. My moment of realization was when I realized I probably spent about $200 on weed every two weeks maybe even less. To make it worst I struggle with bipolar and untreated ADHD and its only made that worst. I really think its time to give it up. It's crazy because I asked my spirit guides for a sign that I needed to quit and I got a notification from an affirmation app that I have on my phone  and it said "" listen to the thoughts that you most frequently think about, that will tell you the answer""(I've been thinking about quitting for two years).

I'm a 32 year old man. I've been mixing pot and tobacco together for about 15 years. I absolutely have to quit smoking for health reasons, and have known this since Nov. 2019, but have had so much trouble because of covid. 

Well, I haven't smoked a mole since last sunday and I'm starting to get some pretty ugly withdrawals I think? I can't stop shaking and sweating but my temperature is 95 deg. and I can still smell things but, ofc I'm paranoid with these symptoms that I could be getting sick.

I feel nauseous and weak and I have no appetite. I really just wish I had someone to talk to because its 1:15am and this sucks. I know these symptoms are probably just heavy withdrawal but would love if someone on this sub could reassure me of that..

It isn't meant to bring anyone down, it's just been a way for me to cope but I realize that it's only been helping me so now I wanna try and help anyone struggling. I also really appreciate everyone's kind words when I do have these lows through it all, this is an amazingly supportive community and it's definitely the only reason I've stayed sober for so long.

I think I'm finally getting out of the funk that both starting weed and then the withdrawal period put me through. I had the most motivation today than I have in awhile and I'm starting to feel normal again. The whole reason I quit in the first place was because I started to feel less normal. I started having some schizophrenic tendencies. I questioned reality a lot, I was super paranoid that everyone was judging me and plotting against me and outright hated me. I've had people tell me they like me and I assumed it was for an ulterior motive. Then when I quit, every seemed to get increasingly worse. I kept telling myself it was because of the weed. Then I'd convince myself that it's actually something wrong with me and the weed would be a good coping mechanism to stop this. But just remembering that my biggest problems started during weed was usually enough to prevent me from taking up the habit again. So then I'd usually hop on to here and see what people had to say and it helped quite a bit.

I kept getting discouraged a lot of times because when I'd hop on to this Reddit, I felt like a lot of people would say there problems from weed were gone in a week or a month but I was two months in (right now I'm a couple days away from being 3 months in) and I still had these problems. I haven't even been a HUGE stoner for more than a year and there were people who had smoked for decades and their symptoms were disappearing faster than mine. 

I guess the biggest point I'm trying to make is if you feel like you have a special case and that you're starting to believe weed wasn't the problem because you aren't going through the same stuff other people are, stop that thought. It may be true that weed isn't the main reason you feel as bad as you do. It may be true that quitting weed isn't going to fix your life. But it is a massive step in the right direction because continuing weed certainly isn't fixing things. I don't know how many times I kept telling myself if I just smoked again I'd find that motivation because I'd been more motivated to do things but in reality, today I've had more motivation than I ever have when I was high, it just took a while for my brain to get out of this. It may take a week for some of you to feel better, or it may take 3 months, it may take even longer than that but it is so worth it once you get out of it, but it is so worth it. So please, please keep pushing.

These last few months have been hell for me but all of you have helped me tremendously.

Then another part of me says why. To feel good? Wait don't I already feel good? Isn't life already great and aren't I already grateful for everything I already have? Wouldn't that just make weed an overindulgent thing? Like how good can you possibly feel?

Then I start thinking about how weed changes my perspective on life. After I smoke I 'see things differently' or 'feel things differently'. Isn't it important to diversify my perpsective on life and look at things from a different point of view? 

Then it hit me. Every moment is a new perspective. Every single waking moment is a unique moment in time. Why would I need a perspective change when literally every moment is unique. Perspective is rife in life, with or without weed. 

Idk. I don't think weed is a healthy perspective for me. It triggers too much of my past when I started smoking to cope with my family problems. Maybe other people truly benefit from it and thats great, but Im not them, and theyre not me. So I have to stay true to what I believe is best for me and continue to be sober.

First, I have to say just how THANKFUL I am for this subreddit. I'm on a few other recovery reddits but whenever I post about struggling with weed, without a doubt there's always someone on there that insists that smoking weed is ""saving their lives"" and ""isn't that bad"" and don't think people can develop an actual addiction to it. Needless to say, as a pre-hardcore out loud and proud stoner chick who's coming up on almost a year sober (11 months on Monday) from MOSTLY weed and alcohol, it feels really invalidating to hear. So in here, I actually feel like my struggles will be heard and validated.

I've been doing so good at my second round of sobriety (I made it 7 months the first time before relapsing, thinking that I could ""smoke moderately"", and learned that I was in fact an addict) granted I spend a LOT less time in AA rooms. But lately, between having two neighbors in my building who are bonafide stoners and idk, just having a lot of those ""missing the good ol' days"" when I was in denial about having an actual problem with weed, I feel like I'm not as solid as I need to be in my sobriety. Because I still don't feel like AA is the right place to go to to talk about these things (I still enjoy going!!! I just don't feel like it really helps with the specifics of what I'm struggling with), I'm considering trying out MA.

So has anyone had experience with going to MA meetings? Do you find them helpful? I find the fellowships of people in 12 step programs REALLY helpful to my recovery, and I never thought about checking it out but I'm considering it and wanted to hear peoples' experiences.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4473833}"

This is the first time I‚Äôm checking in.  (Is there a daily checkin thread?)

Over a year ago I decided it was time to stop drinking.  When I did that, I also took a break from smoking.  I mean why not.  I saw the benefits pretty quickly.  A lot of things I‚Äôve read here over the years rings true.

Since that time, I‚Äôve been on a roller coaster with cannabis.  I stopped for a few months, then fell back in for more than that many months, before doing it all over again about 3 or 4 times now.  I feel like the roller coaster is going to continue.  Maybe I‚Äôm just not that committed, or maybe I just actually enjoy it before the eventual slide into monotony.  

I‚Äôm trying something new, I need accountability and to keep in front of me why I am quitting. 

Typically what gets me in trouble is the little vape cartridges. It‚Äôs just too easy, they are high thc, and I have an addictive personality so it gets to the point where my tolerance just gets sky high and I‚Äôm not even getting that high.  Yes, this is what addiction looks like. 

So this recent round, I stopped smoking and vaping maybe 4 or 5 weeks ago, but instead of torturing myself with cold turkey withdrawals, I decided to use gummies to wean myself down.  And so far that has worked.  Where at one point (peak) I took 30mg and felt basically nothing, I quickly got down to where 5mg I do feel it pretty 
well, and then I stopped and am now on day 3. 

Last night I had temptation, even just to take 2.5 mg, but I was able to be present and get my self to understand that it just wasn‚Äôt many worth it.

Because of my new approach, I‚Äôm not sure what the withdrawal will be like this time. So far, nothing extreme. Feel a little like an upset stomach after I woke up, like hunger pains.  Maybe that‚Äôs all they are.

Long term weed addict here. I stopped smoking on Dec 27th after a huge amount of pain, turmoil and ultimatum from my partner that UNLESS I quit smoking, went into abstinence based recovery she would leave me (we have an 11 month year old son). I had a breakdown and became terrified and knew I had to accept I'm an addict and needed help. Since then I've been in an outpatient programme and been going to NA meetings. But I've relapsed 3 times since then. Last time was yesterday. I smoked weed and became terrified, paranoid, felt huge amount of shame and internal badness...iI felt like my life was ruined...it was horrible but was also a good experience because it reminded me how terrible I feel when I smoke weed. Now its back to day one for me and I'm feeling so defeated and struggling to motivate myself out of this depression I feel. I know its insane but all I want to do is smoke weed and escape from all my problems. Even though I have had the experience of feeling so bad when I relapsed, even though I will lose my family, my house and maybe my job if I continue to go down this path...I still want to smoke...thats how I know I'm an addict friends. I can never ever smoke again or use weed in any form. I'm an addict and I'm powerless to my addiction. So here I go again. Day one again after a million day ones.

Morning of Day 4 broke me.,"I had soup night of Day 3 and actually felt pretty good! However, overnight (while my poor stomach was trying to digest) things took a turn.

The nausea I face in the morning is unbelievable. For about 5-6hrs, eating is so uncomfortable that I cry. I just start weeping. I'm 100% dedicated to this, and refuse to back down. But good lord, this nausea is earth-shattering.

Some factoids about my experience for context:

\--- 30-ish years old, smoked for a year straight, + edibles (nothing over 100mg a day). Prior two years were lighter use, but enough to be considered excessive/more than 'periodic'. No dabbing or wax, thank the lord. Quit cold-turkey, too scared to try 'weaning off of it slowly' in case these four days reset. Good lord, no fucking way.

\--- no stomach pain or vomiting (symptoms are limited to nausea, body chills, hot/cold flashes, disturbed sleep, and dehydration/malnourishment as a result of indigestion. Not constipated - quite the opposite. Also chest tightness, I believe also associated with the nausea.)

\--- SHOWERS DO NOT HELP WITH THE NAUSEA. I feel like the steam in the morning only adds to my labored breathing. The hot water is great for my body chills (which are worst in the morning), but I don't stay int he shower for more than it takes to stop the cold shakes -- 20-30min MAX. It kinda makes the nausea feel worse. :(

\--- am I the only one on this sub having crazy farts??? Why is no one talking about this?? (kinda funny, but seriously.)

\--- My energy is gone. Y'all have been recommending exercise, but honestly I feel like I have a 50% chance of fainting if I tried to walk just around my block. Not sure how to get physical exercise in while I'm still feeling fragile.

\--- I'm finding the smell of food repulsive, but have found that warm foods go down better (perhaps because they help warm my body from the inside, making up for the lack of body heat THC use used to generate.)

Since I didn't have any vomiting, and (I believe) caught incoming CHS before it had the full opportunity to manifest, I am optimistic that my recovery will be better than for others (even though everyone is different). Besides, if a 73-year-old man who's been smoking for 40 years can do it on this sub, I can fucking do it.

To those of you posting that it gets better -- you're my heroes. I'm trying not to count the days (especially when weeping or having a breakdown), but seeing y'all post on day 7/8 and saying you can feel the difference is all the encouragement I need. THANK YOU.

**If anyone has tips on how to provide better conditions for my poor stomach, please let me know!!** (I do liquids/squishy foods whenever possible -- soup, applesauce, crackers, tea, but not ginger -- I have never digested it well. I think my stomach may be producing **extra bile**, so any tips for dealing with that specifically would be greatly appreciated.)

Now, just to avoid the instinct to go to the ER.... can't have covid on top of this. Besides, if I'm keeping electrolytes/liquids/food down, there's really no point unless circumstances change.

I'm turning 50 next summer, the past 12 years of consistently being high every night has come to an end, I hope. I've tried quitting multiple times, tried becoming just a recreational weekend toker, convinced myself that the weed made me more creative.

So much potential wasted. 12 years where nothing really happened.

I have been lurking on here for about 6 months. I have been smoking pot for 10 years, 8 of those years have been daily use, and 6 of them have been daily mixing with tobacco. I smoke about 3 grams a day.

I have my doubts about quitting. Part of me wants to for the extra time, extra energy, and a new outlook on life. The other part of me doubts if I will really be better off. Even if I quit for a year, what if I still prefer the way I was as a daily smoker? Obviously I could just go back at that point.

I think I may be more on top of my to do list  if I was sober, but it is just so satisfying to know I have a routine at the end of the day. I always smoke right before bed. The only issue with this is if I am sleeping somewhere I can not smoke.

Weed makes me happy and makes me enjoy a life that would otherwise be not the best (working class, poor, etc.) Most of my time is spent working or smoking.

Sorry for the long post, I just have doubts about the whole thing. I know I may be better off in terms of time and memory, but I think I may not enjoy life as much when I am sober.

I've been smoking pot now for little over 9 years (I'm currently 27), with never going more than a month without returning to it. Recently, I've made several changes to my lifestyle (improving my diet, regular exercise, even meditation occasionally. I also managed to overcome a coke addiction which nearly ruined my life) as I've done almost nothing with my life and finally want better for myself, and for my children and family by extension.

As I write this, I'm currently on day 12 with no weed. The first week was eye opening, I felt better than I have for years, sleep was finally leaving me feeling rested, my confidence has come back ten fold and my motivation was infectious. I loved telling people how long I'd gone without it, and that I finally felt like I'd left it behind me. Until a few days ago.

I can't explain it, but the last few days have been harder than ever. I find myself unable to concentrate on anything, I've become irritable due to fighting the invasive thoughts in my head all day and when it comes to the evening, it's like a air raid siren in my head, wailing ""you need weed!"" over and over. Even this evening, I gave my last ¬£20 to my friend as I am so scared of going home, caving and losing not only the progress that I've made, but all of the motivation I have left. It's supposed to get easier with each passing day, first week is the hardest and all that, and I am proud that I've come this far without caving yet but this is sevenfold what I felt in the first 7 days. And the intrusive thoughts are shouting 'this isn't worth not smoking weed for' and I can't stand the lines of thought this is making me go down.

I was a multiple times daily smoker since I was 17 years old. I‚Äôm 23 now and I‚Äôve slowly watched all of my passions fall away the more and more I smoked. All I did was work at my toxic job, smoke, eat fast food, sleep, repeat. I even stopped going to college for nursing after two years because I wanted to be high all the time and knew I would need a drug test.

I would check out r/leaves every once in awhile but I was so afraid to quit. I needed it to eat and sleep and regulate my emotions, or so I thought. But I still had that little spark in me that knew this wasn‚Äôt right. 

So I just literally woke up 10 days ago and decided to revamp my whole life! I left my toxic job. I gave the rest of my weed away to a friend. I have been smoke free for 8 days. I‚Äôm painting and singing again. I‚Äôm exercising everyday and loving it. I‚Äôve had some much needed weight loss. I‚Äôm starting to enjoy food without smoking first. 


And now the possibilities are endless. I can travel without worrying about smoking. I can wake up in the morning feeling refreshed. I can climb a flight of stairs without gasping for air. I can keep my room clean. I can walk my dog daily. I can go to work without getting high. I can interact with my family without getting high. I now have the energy to fulfill my dreams that I‚Äôve been putting off for too damn long. 


I am just so happy today that I could cry. I wouldn‚Äôt be in the position I am today if it wasn‚Äôt for reading all of your posts and suggestions and feeling the love from you guys.

Let‚Äôs all take this day to be proud of what we have achieved so far! We are so worth it.

When I would smoke, for the most part it disconnected me from that part of myself. 

It‚Äôs hard not to go back, I‚Äôm battling myself super hard right now not to go to the dispensary and get a tincture (smoking in general has proved to be very hard on my health).

So much has happened in my life, from childhood until now. I‚Äôve had abusive partners, emotionally dysfunctional and codependent family dynamics, and have developed pretty profound antisocial tendencies. 

I know now that weed just kept me in a mode where I didn‚Äôt have to feel all my sadness and lack of identity. It actually made me feel more like myself.. and *okay* with being myself (I grew up with a Dad who criticized me very much for my emotions). 

Can anyone relate? It‚Äôs so hard. I just want to feel okay again =\ it was going well in the beginning but now the reality of what‚Äôs happened to me and the choices I‚Äôve made in reaction to that is starting to hit me again

Why I want to quit: I spend so much money on it. It fucks my memory and my motivation for anything besides more weed. It's the same way I felt when I used to drink alcohol (I am like 5 years sober from ethanol, my husband is like 8 years sober from ethanol). I don't know how to quit other than cold turkey. I smoked yesterday a couple times including last night, and did not go to bed until 3am. I woke up at noon. My sleep schedule is so fucked. I really need to quit. I am starting a new job soon and want to excel...

My husband and I both have autism and have medical cards. We are also both (now sober) alcoholics. I feel like I did when I was addicted to alcohol... He claims he experiences weed differently than alcohol. 

We still have weed. Concentrate and flower and a vape with a couple of pretty-much-empty pods. My husband smokes everyday. I feel isolated from my husband and I wish he would quit too. But he is convinced it is medicine. However, I know even medicine can be abused... As does he as a former opiate addict.

My sponser in AA left me years ago when I said I tried weed and saw it as different than alcohol. I understand ""marjuana maintenance"" now... This will not be easy for me. 

Please wish me luck and if you can give me tips about staying sober in a house with a medical user of cannabis. I feel so compelled to numb my self with overeating, weed, alcohol, or other destructive things and I want to emerge from this sober and strong.... P

This is a rather long post, so if you dont get all the way through it I dont blame you. I had to put this somewhere though, to get it out and hold myself accountable. So here goes....

Yesterday was the day I have been working towards for a while. I gave up. Not on quitting. No, I gave up on smoking. I am so sick of trying to find it, hoping someone can get a hold of it for me within an 8 hour time frame, then immediately feeling guilty because I know my stash will only last 4 days tops. Truthfully, that's just the surface reason for me quitting. I have a wonderful life, but I haven't been able to enjoy it like I should. The guilt of smoking, coupled with the insane desire to, well, smoke is honestly overwhelming.

How many of you can relate to this? Spend too much time/money getting a bag. Then, in utter happiness and excitement, smoke it right up. While enjoying the high, you start to imagine how your life could be sober. Surely it isnt that hard to quit, right? Hey, all of my problems stem from THIS, so obviously I should just drop it. So you try, and the anxiety and frustration hit. You feel so depressed you can't function. So you go back to what you know, the one thing to take that negativity away.

That has been my life for over 15 fucking years. I have had countless jobs (all in good standing), started a new career path and got into college. I received the greatest gift 3 years ago when my beautiful daughter was born. How did I celebrate each of those events? You got it. I smoked my ass off. Because I deserved it. 

I never considered what I really deserved. I never considered that I deserve a life of peace, or that peace would even be possible. It never occurred to me how I was short changing my progress. I never realized how long I've been truly unhappy, despite what I consider to be a wonderful life.

I have battled depression through most of my life, and thanks to therapy I am seeing what has been causing that, so I can address those issues. The trickier part is the ADHD, which makes my head spin so fast I swear its going to fly off my body.  

The funny part (to me) is that you all have been possibly the greatest catalyst to this decision. Your successes, your struggles, your absolute and undying determination have filled me with hope. I dont know what today holds, and I'm not sure I want to. I'll find out soon enough. 

Last night was hell, honestly. Trying to abstain IS NOT the same as waiting until you can finally get a bag. Its so much harder, but from my experience that should mean its so much more worth it. I cried no less than 5 times in as many hours, and the tears continue today. But you know what? I dont want to smoke. I mean, I do. But I want to not so much more. I want true happiness, pride, and confidence. I want my life back.

To that end, I have started playing bass again. Its been sitting beside me for so many years, and I never had the courage to try to learn. Fuck that. I've picked up a few tabs, and I'm learning some beginner exercises. I've cleaned my house from top to bottom, and will get back to that soon. Most of all, I'm going to start meditation/working out TODAY. I'm not sure what else to do, I can only hope I can figure it out as I go along.

Again, thank you all for everything. I will be here, commenting on your posts and providing any support I can. I may be just an internet stranger, but I truly love you all. Most people may not see your struggles, but everyone here does. We live(d) it. If you ever feel weak, please remember that each of you have helped change my life, among countless others. I am forever in your gratitude, and I will do whatever I can to pay this forward.

Thank you for letting me get this out. Any advice on the road ahead will be graciously accepted and implemented. Bless all of you, the members of the strongest and most compassionate community I could ever hope to be a part of.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50706124}"

I picked up smoking weed in August of 2020 when a friend turned me onto MMJ. I started out smoking vape carts for three months straight, getting absolutely blasted pretty much wherever I went. At first, I loved it and I loved how it made me feel. I thought it was helping me access parts of myself I didn't know existed. Cut to November of 2020, and I felt a sudden change in my energy levels and motivation, and a newfound sense of heightened anxiety, but I still found myself wanting to get high all the time.

I decided to quit for 30 days. I was feeling better and felt like I was getting back to myself after three HORRIBLE weeks of withdrawal. I met someone in those 30 days whom I was really interested in and vice versa, and I told myself I could smoke again but only on the weekends. Well the weekends turned into smoking every day, even when I was around this person. I messed up things with this person pretty bad and now they no longer talk to me. I quit for two weeks when they walked away, but have since started to smoke again.

I have really come to realize that, most of the time, weed makes me feel paranoid, disconnected and doubtful of myself and the intentions of those around me, and I don't want to miss out on my life anymore or sabotage my own happiness. I decided that I will quit for the FINAL time on February 1st, even if I have to go through hell again to get to the other side.

If anyone has any suggestions and/or advice, I would really appreciate it. This has been an extremely challenging few months for me.",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.3943927}"

I finally made the decision to quit and went cold turkey this Sunday. It's day 5 now and the withdrawals are kicking my ass. I think the worst of it has passed already (I wouldn't wish the events of day 1 on my worst enemy), but every morning I've been waking up drenched in sweat, heart pounding, feeling like I'm going to vomit. I wake multiple times during the night with these symptoms too. It was so bad this morning that my mind spiralled into some pretty dark places. It truly felt like this sickness would last forever and I thought I'd rather die than feel like this for a second longer. I woke my partner up with my crying & blubbering for the umpteenth time since quitting. I feel so bad for putting them through this, like I'm just a burden & I don't deserve their support. I feel awful for letting my habit get this bad.

I've always struggled with my mental health and was definitely using weed as a crutch for these past 2 years. The biggest problem is that smoking so much weed has lowered my tolerance for life's problems when sober; my anxiety is much worse than it has been in several years, to the point where I had to take a leave of absence from work because my anxiety attacks made me unable to stand or walk. I think a lot of my suicidal thoughts this morning were based in the fear that I would never be able to function normally again without drugs. I know it's just the detox talking and not my wise mind, but I'm having trouble convincing myself that it's going to get better. I can't fathom how I was ever able to get through life sober, especially since my circumstances were significantly harder back then, before I started smoking. I'm in the safest environment I've ever been in now but just the idea of leaving my house makes me want to cry. I feel like a shell of who I once was. I am stubborn though, so I refuse to smoke today, or tomorrow, or the days after that. I know I have the willpower to stop, I was able to kick my drinking habit the same way, but fuck, does it suck to be me right now. I'm so tired of feeling like this.

Honestly, this subreddit alone is what got me out of my spiral this morning. I have to go back to work on Monday (I'm a barista) and I'm really hoping I'm not such a wreck by then.

However, the nature of my dreams was very focused on anxiety-related things, mainly my partner breaking up with me or finding someone else they like. I would also have some pretty wild dreams occassionally, but nothing that compares to last night. I would like to share a little bit of it, for no other purpose than I think they're entertaining. If you want to skip them then skip past the bold text. 

**It began in the future on some kind of military base in the middle of the ocean where two very offical-looking men were having a conversation about trying to catch some kind of creature. This creature was assumed to be very dangerous, and had even altered the course of history when it first appeared hundreds of years ago. As one of the men left and was walking across a bridge, a gigantic black creature (similar looking to a whale but much, much, much larger) came from the depths (the bridge was over water) and nabbed this guy up.** 

**Now its the past and people who are from what I assume is present time were discussing the best course of action to board boats and escape their fate from the creature. But when they boarded these boats and left the ocean suddenly turned lava-like. Some people were able to find refuge, some died, but most were able to find a safe place. When they got there everyone was required to strip their clothes one by one and be washed down as well as their clothes. Much more happened but this is the main gist of this dream.** 

**I also had a lucid dream where I bought and smoked pot. except when I did it in my dream I was half-asleep half-awake (in the dream world. In reality I was fully asleep). It was like I had no control over smoking, I just did it because it was automatic. I immediately threw away all my weed and chastised myself for being such an idiot.** 

Anyway, dreams aside, the withdrawal symptoms are going down a bit. I still have a headache and nausea pretty much constantly, but they are mild. I can tell I'm super irritable but I'm pushing through it. Also, thoughts of ""Oh, you made it this far maybe in the future you can smoke"" are entering my brain, but I know that's the addiction talking. I. Cannot. Moderate. I can't even moderate when I go to the gym. I'll be there for three hours and think ""Oh, I don't hurt bad enough I should just do this some more until I do.""

I smoked for nearly 30 years, with about 22 of that on a daily basis.  My biggest regret is that my marriage fell apart, and my addiction to weed was a major contributor to that.  I still have my kids every weekend and I am present around them now.  I'm slowly improving my life.

When i was younger I had fun smoking with people, but I became dependent on it fairly quickly, and needed to get high to enjoy doing things.  For so many years now, I've been getting high alone.  As many on this forum have described, the buzz is mostly in the preparation and first hit - after that you're just chasing the next hit...  In a constant cycle of taking a hit then planning the next one, taking a hit then planning the next one...  It is so liberating not to be slave to that.

I had tried a number of times to quit prior to this, lasting a few months at the most.  I set goals for myself - one day, one week, one month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, 10 years.  If I can make it 10 years I think I'm good.  I made it to one year and so can you.

The biggest things that have helped me:

* Regularly recounting the reasons i quit and the benefits it brings me
* Regular exercise
* This place - this is my first time posting here, but just reading other people's testimonies inspired me along the way

Quitting has not fixed everything for me.  But it had gotten to the point where I realized that it was not helping me and so I needed to will myself to stop.  There are occasionally things that I miss (getting high was ""fun""), but over the last year it's really become clear that my cravings are more about rewarding myself than actually getting high.  Being cognizant of that helps me deal with boredom I experience.  There are so many benefits that come with being sober.

Hey guys, I‚Äôm new this this group but I want to become a better version of myself. So this year I have a goal to be sober from weed. I‚Äôve been smoking since I was 16yrs old. I‚Äôm now 23yrs. I just started a business and I feel like weed is really slowing down my growth. There are many reasons why I believe it would be beneficial for me to not smoke weed.

Also, I‚Äôm more focused and tend to be able to wake up earlier and easier when I don‚Äôt smoke. The past couple weeks have been tough. So far the longest streak I‚Äôve had has been a week. When quitting, I get a sense of anxiety and depression during the first couple days. I really want to sober up for 90days or more. Ideally half of a year. My biggest challenge has been based on my surroundings. Everyone I know smokes weed so when they invite me it‚Äôs has to pass on. I smoked yesterday after a 3day break. I plan on going on another streak. This time I want to do 2weeks. I won‚Äôt like my surroundings dictate my choices. Starting today I‚Äôll be going strong for 2weeks or more(90days).

I started smoking cigarettes again after almost two years of quitting, and as much as it is a disappointment, it felt great to smoke again. I can‚Äôt even will myself to put the cigarettes down at this point. It was too much to handle not having some sort of substance in my body.

I‚Äôm typing this with tears in my eyes currently just feeling so overwhelmed with raw emotion and pure happiness. 

36 days ago, December 22nd of 2020 I decided it was time for me to end my streak of smoking weed everyday for years straight. I couldn‚Äôt even tell you the amount of time I was consistently smoking weed for on a daily basis. Started my senior year of high school smoking heavy everyday. That quickly got up to 3 times a day. There were days that friends and I would dedicate to just smoking weed all day. I get it, we‚Äôve all been there. We made it our life. But I knew that had to stop. At first it was just an excuse. ‚ÄúOh my depression...‚Äù then I quickly realized, my problems were still there even when I would come down. But by the point you realize that, it‚Äôs too late. You‚Äôre trapped. 

For the first time since being sober, I‚Äôm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I‚Äôm getting over the anxiety and withdrawals. My initial withdrawals kicked my ass. And I‚Äôve thought about smoking so many times. But I come to this sub every single time and realize that I can be strong. That I can pull through. And that I can overcome. Thank you r/leaves , for showing me that I am strong. And that I don‚Äôt need a substance to be happy in life. That I can find myself with just living a peacefully sober life. There‚Äôs no longer a financial burden or psychological burden attached with this substance. Everyone claims it‚Äôs so harmless, but in the grand scheme of things, we know this to not be true. It takes hold of your life. 

My biggest withdrawal was my anxiety. Just felt on edge for so long and felt so anxious everyday. But I couldn‚Äôt find the answers. I got discouraged seeing people get over this within a week or two and thinking that there was something more with me. But as my mental headspace begins to clear, I‚Äôve realized that it was just me still not being able to let go and telling myself that I needed something when I didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a mentality. Everything in life can be boiled down to what we let control us and what we don‚Äôt. And for some it‚Äôs easier than others. I‚Äôm here to remind you to go at your own pace. To find your own happiness. And to find what works for you. There‚Äôs no rush, there‚Äôs no timeline. Just finding what works for you. 

I started meditating and I can not recommend it more. Instead of picking up my phone first thing in the morning, I‚Äôve begun taking the time to sit there and gain control over my own thoughts. And that‚Äôs help my anxiety tremendously. I‚Äôve realized that I can take control over this. That as humans, our biggest fall back and enemy is, well it‚Äôs ourself. Meditating has opened my mind to the idea that if I don‚Äôt allow myself to get flooded with thoughts, I can go about my day so much easier. And remind myself that it‚Äôs okay. I know I‚Äôm kind of ranting now but my goodness I‚Äôm just so overcome with emotion writing this and realizing that I‚Äôm finally back to being me. After a hard fought battle, i know I‚Äôm going to be okay. 

So once again, thank you. For everything. Thank you all for being vulnerable and sharing your stories. Thank you all for caring. And thank you for giving me hope. Wouldn‚Äôt be here without you all.

Longest streak in over three years.,"Daily smoker going through a quarter in under five or six days. This is a big fucking accomplishment for me. I bartend for a living and I posted this on my FB, and it may help people, I hope. :-) What I've noticed;

1. I am SO. MUCH. HAPPIER. I've smiled more in the last twenty days than I have in over three years. And it's genuine. I'm not faking it. I always smoked because it really did help take my mind off of how lonely I used to feel. Dating... him... just exacerbated the loneliness. I can see now how much of my usage correlated to what I was going through with him all the time. My mental health is solid as a rock, and for someone's that struggled with that stuff for years (often very quietly, people don't know how bad it had gotten), it's so nice to wake up in the morning and have those ghosts exorcised and gone.


2. Friendships and bonds, old and new. This came a little bit with pushing myself to make new friends and meet new people after the breakup, for sure. I'm always going to be eternally grateful for the people I met after (you know who you are) who helped me grow from a skeezy sad sack stoner into someone who's so excited to wake up and start the day now. The old friends I've reached out that've been there for me, I have so much love in my heart for you guys. I'm not lonely anymore. THANK YOU.


3. Energy levels are INSANE. I don't wake up groggy anymore. My runs are better. I always justified usage while running in terms of alleviating muscle pain and helping me ""zone out"". The first run I did post-smoking, crushed it. On long shifts at work, my ass would die out about halfway through, just thinking about the next time I'd smoke. Fuck that shit. I'm running into hour nine and ten of a shift now, full speed ahead. Speaking of...


4. HUGE difference in work performance. I feel it. I'm much more inclined to strive to make connections with guests. I feel wittier. I feel sharper and quicker on my feet. I feel more charismatic with people in general. I'm retaining recipes easier, I'm not letting difficult guests knock me down - everything just rolls off my back now. And to those people I've worked with for the past seven months, I'm so sorry you had to put up with old me. Genuinely sorry! And also, um, thank you. <3


5. MONEY. Oh my fucking god. I'm doing great now at work. I don't sweat bills. I recently deposited money in the bank, and kinda' lame but hey, honesty, literally cried happy tears when I realized that's the most money I've had saved in over three years. I'm tackling my debt. I'm watching my spending habits. No dreading the end of the month for weeks at a time now. The financial stress jar for me is now completely empty. And to know I'm supporting myself and ONLY myself again, on my own, and nailing it... I'm very proud of myself.


6. I feel so fucking excited to date again. I feel way more attractive as a whole having left that shit behind. I don't feel like it's an attractive habit anymore, to be hacking up your lungs left and right and always look tired or glassy-eyed. Not disparaging those who still do - but it's just not a good look for me personally anymore. I think the mental aspect of my health has tied into the confidence levels and feeling attractive again. That's so exciting for me!


7. My opinion of myself has gotten so much better. Sounds weird, but I genuinely love myself now more than I ever have. Imperfections and all. Weed wasn't doing me any favors. At all.


Just a few of the things. I'm sure there's more. And here's to seeing this next year, popping up for me. If I lost my way again, I just need to remember that I found it before - and that I'm capable of doing it again.",24,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7963413}"

I posted here a little over 2 weeks ago, when I was nearing a week, saying how well it was going but I‚Äôd had some difficulties with dreams etc. 

Everything had been going fine and I was completely in a better headspace but recently I‚Äôve been having a real hard time. I‚Äôve been tempted to smoke multiple times, however I saw a post on here about resisting the urge and the fact that you‚Äôll always feel accomplished for doing so - so far I have resisted. 

The issues I‚Äôm having are more in myself as a person, I‚Äôm really starting to be snappy with the people I used to smoke with, I live with multiple people and have been clashing a lot with them over issues that *they are causing* however I know I‚Äôd tend to handle them better when I was a smoker. 

Is this a normal period to go through around this timeframe having quit? I was doing so well with no cravings and now I‚Äôm snappy and craving. Will this pass? I feel like I‚Äôm posting more here to vent than anything, however if anyone has any helpful info that‚Äôd be really appreciated as I‚Äôm starting to struggle a lot.

I'm feeling way down.  A few weeks ago, at 101 days no cannabis, I was so down that I thought I'd try edibles again (no smoking) and for about 7 days went thru about eight 100mg bags of gummies.  I stopped 2 weeks ago.  I thought the edibles would get me thru a tough time.  I tried edibles last fall for a few weeks before I finally quit cannabis, and when I quit them had horrible nightmares like never in my life.  Well, kind of the same thing happened again; after I quit the edibles a couple weeks ago I've gotten really bad dreams.  This sadness worries me I want to be strong for my wife, six years ago I had a breakdown and was hospitalized for a week - at that time I was smoking like a chimney, drinking 10 beers or more a day and depressed about my son, and when my wife took me to the hospital it was the worst feeling of my life, I was ready to kill myself.

 So now I'm completely sober again - no smoking for about 120 days, and after this recent edible relapse no cannabis at all for 21 days.  Trouble is I'm extremely depressed right now.  I'm really missing my estranged son (meth problem), and lately I've been extremely frustrated trying unsuccessfully to get my wife her COVID vaccine - dealing with the state (CA) is way worse than any DMV.  She's panicky, afraid she'll die before she ever gets a shot.   I'm starting to have anxiety and this bad depression.  I keep wondering,  that since I feel so bad, a little pot might help me out.  I won't drink again, the edibles exacerbate my depression, but I keep thinking that for my own good having a little smoke occasionally might make life bearable.  Was one good memory from Vietnam.

I'm just reaching out here.  I'm feeling weak and thinking a few hits of weed would make life bearable altho I know it won't bring my son back into my life or help me get my wife a COVID appointment.  And baby I'm bored.  Good luck to all of you.  I'm hoping I can get thru this straight. I'm thankful for this site that I can talk to- don't have friends or relatives to lean on except my wife and she can't handle more sadness.  Love to you all.

This is my first post, isn't that exciting :) it is! I am an avid lurker in this sub like an alligator in the reeds (minus the deadly predatory instincts and pointy teeth) and now I spring upon you all with what will likely be an incoherant rant. 

I have managed to succesfully avoid Satan's Salad for two months now (YAY!!!) and y'know, don't get me wrong my guys, I am very pleased with this development. You might even say i'm ""proud"" of such a thing! But gosh darnit I feel so FLAT at the moment! 

I have been missing, dearly, the ""magic"" in things, the spark and colour and vividness of a great song, book, or the company of my girlfriend. It feels as though the pazazz and vibrancy in everything is sorely absent in everything. 

My thoughts also feel like a hazy, congealed blob of grey mush at the moment, thoughts and sensations are indistinct and blunted. I also have little interest in doing the things that lend me vitality and excitement (writing music, drawing, reading and cooking), in fact partaking in any of those makes me feel worse! It brings about some vague stress and anxiety that I can't pinpoint, because as previously stated all is mired in a thick haze. I guess you could call it depression. 

I'm sure some of you here have experienced this, did it last long for you? Will I ever get the colour back? Is it even weed related at all? Am I in fact just a dull as beans person? Why does engaging in ""mindful"" activities such as running, walking, meditation, learning japanese or bashing myself with a stick lead me back to this same stagnant state? 

If our perception of our world is a rice cracker then someone has swatted all the toppings off of mine! There's some residual smears of avocado but it just doesn't disguise the taste of ACTUAL FUCKING CARDBOARD! 

I should probably mention that i'm in the midst of processing and reeling from some early childhood trauma. Won't go into details but basically Manically Bipolar Mother + Abusive alcoholic Father + Defiant Hyperactive brother √ó Divorce = One unhappy kiddo! I get into some pretty dark places sometimes and have self harmed in the past. 

If you've read this far, I appreciate it! This is my fourth or fidth attempt at quitting the Evil Shrub and I feel strong on it this time around. Any advice, answers or even related anecdotes would be oh so lovely and appreciated!

I smoked bud pretty often in high school, night time and weekends and sometimes concentrates. Continued smoking a lot a few years after than but managed to quit after experiencing a lot of anxiety when I was high. At the start of COVID lockdowns, i was feeling pretty anxious about the state of the world and got back into smoking concentrates. Started as a bedtime thing to help with sleeping, but then for a few months it was added to my daytime routine as well. Maybe 1g cart per week or so. I decided to quit cold turkey last week for the same reasons as before. THC was no longer was helping, but rather numbing me, and it was making me anxious. I could tell that I was far too dependent on it. I've been having a rough time with some more physical withdrawal symptoms, which are mostly due to my generalized anxiety disorder. At the same time, the state of the world with COVID has definitely increased my anxiety about health related things... another reason why I decided to quit. I'm planning on going to the doctor to help ease my mind, but it's been such a lonely process so far. I have no desire to return back to smoking, but the withdrawal is rough... wasn't expecting it.

I have a super great idea for a youtbe channel and I know it can be a way for me to live of my passion in maybe a couple of years.

In reality, what was happening was I was fogging all of my complex emotions and never dealing with them. Instead choosing to enjoy my nice little bubble where all makes perfect sense, where I've got it completely figured out and I dont *need* any answers because I've got them all rolled up in a RAW ready to course through me.

I am a 30 year old male and I work in IT Sales. I had my first joint when I was 17 and have been smoking almost daily for more than 10 years. There was one year (I think 2015) when I did not smoke for almost a full year because I had a huge paranoid breakdown while smoking and had to go to the ER because I was convinced I was having a heart attack. When I tried smoking again the same symptoms appeared so I had to quit. 
What‚Äôs funny is that I did not have any withdrawal symptoms whatsoever even though inward smoking 2-3 joints every day at that time. 

Unfortunately, after about a year, I smoked again while I was drunk and felt fine. This let to me smoking more and more again (very small quantities at first) until I was back to my usual printing. 

I had another similar paranoid attack in 2019 which let to me stopping again for half a year but sure enough I got back to daily smoking. 

4 weeks ago, I managed to switch from smoking to vaping and 2 days ago I decided to quit. The first two nights were absolutely horrible, I got almost no sleep and even worse, I felt like inward having some kind of depressive episode. I have been unable to get any work done and I am constantly extremely sad. This feeing is very hard to bear. 

The weird thing is that when I stopped smoking the first two times (because of paranoia) quitting was super easy. My brain basically associated the weed with the paranoid feelings and I was able to just quit. No withdraw symptoms, no depression, no night sweats, no cravings. Nothing. 
But now that I have decided to quit using willpower it‚Äôs just so much harder. 

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm forcing myself to quit even thought I don‚Äôt really want to. As if the weed is serving some kind of purpose in my life and I can‚Äôt just cut it out. 
Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking this. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. But it feels like I‚Äôm just forcing myself even thought I don‚Äôt really need to quit. 

The thing is: on the surface, my life is going great. I have a good job, make good money, have a Gf that I love, a great family etc. - but I still need the weed. Inside me, everything is not so great. I have lots of self doubts, mood swings, regrets etc. 

Sorry for the long text. My questions are:

- Can I just quit the weed by willpower alone or do I need to go on a search about what role the weed is playing in my life and try to fix that first? 

- Out of your experience: what makes somebody addicted to weed? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the substance itself...

I want to quit but I'm scared of missing it. Weed is so nice. It's calming and relaxing and makes all my favorite things (food, porn, video games, sleeping) so much better!

I've been working up the courage to post for a while now, and I know I'm still early days but I just wanted to lend my experience so far. 3+ years of daily smoking multiple joints throughout the day. Felt like weed just made my life so much better, so much lighter, so much more in tune with how I wanted to be as a person. 

Until it just, didn't any more. And it didn't for a long time before I packed it in. I smoked my last joints about a week before Christmas, so thats about 5/6 weeks ago now. And the best way I found to quit was to just, not buy it any more. I live in a country where it's illegal, so even though I have had a regular and reliable dealer for 2 years, I just haven't contacted him. 

The first week or two was dreadful. We were on Christmas lockdown so at least I didn't inflict my bad mood on my family. Stress, crying, not sleeping, vivid dreams when I did sleep. But then it all just sort of, eased out. 

Now, I can hold a conversation.

Now, I can watch something or read something and REMEMBER that I did. 

Now, the wheeze in my lungs has eased up and I can breathe easier.

Now, my anxiety is literally 5% of what it was, and I wake up... Cheerful.

Now, I actually WANT to call my friends, and have things to talk about, other than trying to chase a high that stopped a long time ago. 

I didn't realise what a drain on my life it had been. I thought I was cool. I thought I was enlightened. I thought I was chill. 

Guess what, I'm still those things. But at least now I know I am, and not just abusing a false confidence

I don't even miss it.

I have essentially revolved my whole personality and lifestyle around it. From the moment I started smoking, I could, and did smoke more than almost anyone I knew.
 I had convinced myself that it was helping me cope with so many things, such as stopping my nightmares, ADHD symptoms, concentration, and diet, not to mention finally having something to bond with peers over. It opened my horizons and allowed me to make friends for the first time in my life. I gave it so much credit, and gave myself none. 
The thing is, I am starting to realize that it has been a crutch for me, and not the solution I thought it was. I am realizing that I don‚Äôt feel like myself until I smoke. It is the first thing I want to do as soon as I get home from work, and the last thing I do before going to bed. 
It has not been uncommon for me to spend more money on it than my rent. I can and have regularly smoked an OZ/week. 
Something has to change, and I don‚Äôt know where to start. I am also afraid to find out who I am without it, I have spent more years on this planet as a smoker than a non-smoker, my entire life after 13. 
I have been thinking about this post for a few days now, and decided to write it today, while still 100% sober, so I don‚Äôt break any rules. I am having trouble keeping my thoughts together, so if I am hard to follow, I do apologize. 
The thought of stopping ‚Äòcold turkey‚Äô is terrifying, yet I know myself well enough to know that trying to moderate usage prior to outright quitting probably won‚Äôt work either. My chest and stomach literally hurt, and my hands shake at the thought of not smoking, even though my brain knows I should, no, NEED to quit. 
I guess my question is: how can I help push myself to be ready to make the changes I KNOW I should. I don‚Äôt want to be a slave to this anymore.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.55131507}"

It's something I've learned in therapy and from r/stopdrinking. In therapy we said two things:

""Embrace The Moment.""

and

""I will not smoke (eat/consume/whatever word works for you) today."" 

In /stopdrinking they say: 

IWNDWYT

I Will Not Drink With You Today.  

Tomorrow doesn't exist. Looking forward days or years only brings anxiety. I used to burden myself with thoughts like, ""If I could just make it a week, I'd be okay. I can moderate."" 

""I'll go a year without weed just to prove to myself I can.""

""I used responsibly when I started, so I can do the same now."" 

These are past and future focused thoughts. They did me no good. The past is done and the future hasn't happened. What is concrete, what is real, is now. It's the only state we ever exist in, and where real change happens. 

It takes practice, but embracing the moment is a muscle that gets stronger with every rep. No rest days necessary. Every time I get anxiety about my use (or anything), I observe where my mind goes, then pull it back to the present and ground myself. I don't worry about not using tomorrow.

I just recently joined this subreddit and all of the stories have helped me so much! I appreciate each and everyone of you!

Now on to my personal experiences, Just some notes I‚Äôve been taking mentally because I can do that now:

It has been very difficult to sleep I‚Äôm usually getting at most 4-6 hours at a time and that‚Äôs all that I need it seems. The dreams I have been having have all been very specific and vivid to me. I‚Äôve had dreams where I‚Äôve had to deal with each emotion I‚Äôve kept held down by smoking the first night has been the worst so far having four very vivid dreams. Dealing with mostly anger and sadness. Those have been the worst and were outright nightmares of myself.

Slowly I‚Äôve been having more vivid dreams that aren‚Äôt as bad but they still wake me up in the middle of each night. 

On another note I really wanted to hit my dab pen last night the cravings were intense and I had to have my girlfriend hide it in a place that I will never be able to see it (she is quitting with me but doesn‚Äôt have the same issues I have with it) 

My brain specifically has had almost an emptiness at the top of both sides and I‚Äôve realized that I haven‚Äôt really been this conscious for this long in 5 years. The clarity and productivity is starting to increase. I would smoke and see things procrastinate and always put it off instead of doing it when I notice it. But now I keep remembering things one after the other. Things I‚Äôve read things I‚Äôve heard. 

I am pretty add and ocd so smoking always suppressed that but now I‚Äôm starting to clean as I go I‚Äôm never not doing something productive unless I‚Äôm enjoying a leisure. I have always followed lifetips here on Reddit and I am managing to remember and incorporate them into my daily life.


TL;DR: after just 4 days the mental clarity is quite immense helping me in productivity an my memory is rapidly improving. I‚Äôm still having very intense cravings, night sweats, vivid dreams, insomnia, and a strange feeling in my head. But overall I‚Äôm feeling good about quitting it for good",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4377213}"

After years of therapy to address non-drug related family crap, he and I have an okay relationship as long as I do two things:

* Expect nothing of him. This means taking on the initiative to stay in contact. To call and visit. To start the conversations. To keep showing up knowing I may get little out of interactions. To tell him about what I'm up to beause he isn't going to ask.
* Accept him for who he is as a person. 

These two things are really tough! He often feels like a peer and not a parent. He just wants to have fun and get fucked up, smoking and drinking from the moment he wakes up to the moment he falls asleep.  *He also has a degenrative condition in his neck that has drastically reduced his mobility in the past 3-4 years.* This could have been reversed with diet and exercise since he is still young (mid 50's), yet he has chosen to completely ignore it and just not take care of himself. This hurts to watch him hurt.  Each visit is a little worse.

He will not talk about it at all and after much trial and error I am aware that he will only open up to me if I ignore it too. Which sucks! I don't want to be an enabler and also want to get some time in with this person before this completely derails their life.

I can only assume the reasons behind his refusal to address this, but soon he will not be able to drive a vehicle on his own, work in construction as usual, and already can not look ""up"". Literally. He cannot move his neck yet just pushes on thtough the pain, hitting his bowl constantly to deal with it.

I‚Äôm celebrating 79 days clean today and life is so much better than it was nearly three months ago. I‚Äôve heard people comparing smoking weed to living life on ‚Äúhard mode‚Äù and that is so true. Weed made me lazy, forgetful, and OK with being bored. Today I‚Äôm much more articulate, I don‚Äôt forget what I‚Äôm saying halfway through a sentence, I don‚Äôt walk into a room or unlock my phone only to forget what I was about to do. My vocabulary has improved and I can speak coherently! I‚Äôm more present at work and willing to take on extra tasks.

Best of all, I‚Äôm feeling my feelings. It was really scary at first because the main reason I smoked was to numb myself. But I‚Äôve learned that I enjoy life more when I allow myself to feel the full spectrum of emotions. Numbing with drugs numbs both the good and the bad. I‚Äôm embracing  the fact that it‚Äôs normal to feel emotions, a wide range of them, and that they are temporary and I‚Äôll eventually feel better even if I‚Äôm having a tough day/week. 

Life isn‚Äôt perfect and I still struggle. I still have a long way to go in improving my daily habits that I badly neglected during active addiction. But I‚Äôm so grateful that I‚Äôve done this for myself. 

What has helped: 

Marijuana Anonymous! I‚Äôm going to meetings daily (on zoom), got a sponsor and I‚Äôm working the steps. I‚Äôm not religious and hated the idea of 12 step programs but I was so desperate to stay sober this time that I knew I had to do things very differently.

Being kind to myself. For the first month or so I had almost no expectations of myself beyond working and staying sober. And even at work I let myself slack off a bit. The only thing that mattered was staying sober. 

Leaning on my support system and being honest with those I‚Äôm closest to about my addiction. I don‚Äôt want to hide this part of myself anymore I think being open will discourage me from relapsing.

Backstory: 19 years of age, been smoking since I was 16. Recently took a couple months to get off smoking because it was numbing me, making me lazy, killing my motivation, and just overall making me too comfortable in life. (Like hitting cruise control for your life.)

Now, as of the last 30 days, I had dabbled into a few puffs maybe once a week here in the last several weeks, and each time I did, I kinda knew I would of rather of been sober instead. Then last night I decided to smoke with my friend because I played the ‚Äúsocial pass‚Äù excuse in my head. After just a couple small hits, I immediately could become aware of the anxiety that was starting to hit me. I‚Äôd rethink everything I said last night and became extremely too hyper aware of my friends perspective on me at the time. 

At this time, it finally hit me that weed no longer serves me any purpose, at least right now where I‚Äôm at in life. The days I spent sober this week were 10000x better than that couple hours I was high last night. And I‚Äôm not over exaggerating that. When I‚Äôm sober, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm actually being me. I was 100x more social when I got to my friends last night and as soon as I got high, that went straight south instantly.

It's obviously a subjective definition, but I know that when I think of a casual weed user, I imagine it's someone who doesn't buy their own stuff ever, but just accepts some at a party once every blue moon. Maybe that's an extremely casual user to you.

I used to think I was once a casual user, but when I really consider and quantify my early usage... I went straight from experimental use my first time after a bad breakup, to my next use being with a good friend who was dating a dealer and got endless amounts of weed. After that second time, that became my weekend life, Friday night until Sunday evening, every weekend of an entire semester of college until I lost so much focus and got so bad into my pre-existing mental illnesses that I had to drop out of college. 

I used to think that was my casual period. No. I don't think I ever was a casual user. As soon as I found dealer friends that enjoyed my company when I came back home after dropping out, that was my every evening and weekend. The only time I could consider myself even close to casual was the short time of coming back home when I didn't have a dealer or stoner friend and had to buy from a family member. Even then, I'd take what little amount I'd get, desperately smoke it, and get as fucked up as I could.

Today is officially month two of sobriety for me after 7 years of heavy usage, the whole time I was smoking. Still, even while I can and do acknowledge how much better off I am emotionally, cognitively, plus financially... I find myself fantasizing about ""returning"" to casual use in the future.

There is no return to something I never knew. The quantification of our hours, days, months, and years sober is gratifying and motivational. At the end of the day, I think those of us who still dream of returning to something we once had need to really consider what it was we once had. Was it really, actually enjoyable? Or was it numbing in a socialized setting to cope with things that you could have worked through? Or was it a distraction from your own powerlessness that really left you with even less power in terms of your functionality? Maybe it seemed like a muse, but also, maybe you were and still can be a creative person. Maybe even moreso when you are better able to process what is going on around you and in your innerworld without those dulled senses.

This is now the 3rd time where my usage has gotten similar and I‚Äôve quit in the past year and this is by far the worst.

This time around the first week was relatively easy, but second week is where things went to shit. The restless sleep, intense dreams, insomnia, and stomach issues. For me, my entire upper chest to my stomach becomes one big wad of tense muscles I can‚Äôt calm down regardless of muscle relaxers and the like. At the same time my throat feels like there is a permanent lump there and due to the tension in my chest, stomach, and back I don‚Äôt feel like I can cough properly. This leads to coughing, gagging, and me sobbing while trying to breathe. The lump in my throat has translated to weird tongue positioning which makes swallowing hard, and flem builds up because I‚Äôm so anxious from the sensation, this also causes coughing. Meanwhile, my joints are just aching, sore, and stiff. This is week 2 of that and I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. From wake to bed, and nothing seems to help. I try to distract myself all day but I can‚Äôt stop hyperfocusing on how I can‚Äôt relax my body and everything‚Äôs feels uncomfortable and I don‚Äôt know what to try next. Sometimes the anxiety and feeling all this at once makes me want to go to the emergency room but its a pandemic and I can‚Äôt imagine having COVID when i already feel like I can‚Äôt breathe.

This, or something like this, has happened every time I quit, but I‚Äôve never had it like this and I‚Äôm really scared I broke my lungs. I don‚Äôt feel like everything is going to be okay and I just want to talk to somebody about it. I know thats likely the anxiety from quitting still talking but I‚Äôd give anything to feel like I can take a deep breath, clear my chest, and sleep peacefully. The past few times I‚Äôve felt like I needed to take a break. This time I truly never want to smoke it again",7,"{'pandemic': 2, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8820798}"

I got to a point where stopping cannabis for short period is not much a problem anymore,i've stopped multiple time during this year, for 2 to 3 month straight, i don't have any withdrawls anymore (or very light, like hyper salivation in mouth, and getting bored at home for the first 3 days. I sleep like a baby anyhow...

Each time i wish i would stop for good but i still came back to it, telling me i miss the effect and i could start again but mamage my intake to be occasional, but it never works. I always start taking weed all day everyday not long after. It's like i see the pros and cons of weed, and my ass is still in the middle, never able to pick a side for good.

When i m on weed streak after a few weeks i see cleary the negative impacts it has on my life: lack of motivation to do anything productive, lungs getting dirty and light trouble to breath, being less present for my family, getting away of my dreams (personnal projects)

My question is:

How it started
At first I thought of it as a treat. Half a joint every night was more than enough. Slowly by slowly half turned into one then 1 turned into 2. Eventually smoking on weekends throughout the day became a regular thing. As work started getting more stressful my consumption went significantly up. Started adding tobacco which made it feel better at the time but all the more destructive. Eventually got to the point where I was burning through an ounce every 4 days. Gained over 40 lbs in less than 2 years. Started hoping on work conference calls with a few in me already. Got to the point where I wanted to quit and would say let me finish what I have. Then when I had enough for one or two more I would buy some more....

How I stopped:

Had a recurring I should quit thought, and when I finally decided I had 2 ounces on me. I threw it out as well as all my papers lighters grinders, everything. First week was hard. Couldn't sleep, ate barely anything, had night sweats, incredibly agitated. But slowly by slowly around the 1 month mark the fog started to lift. Realized that weed had averaged me out. Was never really happy or sad but neutral. Over the following months I started to laugh more deeply, feel anger, joy sadness on a deeper level. That's when I realized the past few years I was completely withdrawn.  Got a therapist, lost 20 lbs. Every now and then I do get the urge but acknowledging I want to, but I'm choosing not too has helped quite a lot 

R/leaves was very helpful whenever I had the urge to start again. Reading those milestone stories at 24 hours, 3 days, one week, a month , 3 months , 6 months made it all seem very attainable.

Day 1 again for me! 

After multiple failed attempts to quit after almost 10 years of daily use, I thought I could never go a day without weed. I tried every trick in the book: sports, meditation, medication, natural (-ish) alternatives, starting seeing a therapist, but nothing would help. The longer I had ever succeeded to not smoke in the past decade was 4 days last August.  I then found this thread in November and it was so incredibly eye-opening to read everybody else's experiences I really felt compelled to actually give it a shot. I was sober for a month, from November 25 to December 25. 

During this time I felt a lot clearer and a lot happier than I did in a long time. The withdrawals weren't nearly as bad as I thought they would - even though I did go through a couple of sleepless nights - and the feeling of freedom is so joyous little can compare to it. 

How is it my day 1 again you ask? I've obviously relapsed. The most annoying part is it was planned relapse. I had agreed with my therapist I would email her on the 25/12 to tell her about my journey so I saw that date as the goal - if I got there, I surely deserved a reward. So I told myself, I am going go a whole month without smoking and, after Christmas, I'll take the weekend to relax and do whatever I want. Needless to say, the weekend lasted a month and I am already knee-deep in this shit again. 

I wake up thinking about weed, go to bed thinking about weed, I think about it when I am alone and with friends, working, exercising: it takes on my whole life and I am tired.  Even though I am fairly productive and manage to live a nice life, I know I am underachieving and that I am nowhere near where I thought I could (should / would?) be at 28. 

So yesterday I made again the decision to quit. It is crazy how quickly cravings start taking over. I started writing this post in the morning, got sidetracked by work and now that I finally got a chance to get back to it, my resolve to quit is already fleeting................I get reminded of my more dynamic sober self and immediately find a way to convince myself I am okay all is well and that once more won't hurt?  The problem is that it is never just once.

I'm 7 days SOBER after a 10 year daily habit. I was using very small amounts towards the end so I'm not suffering noticeable withdrawals, which is great. I knew cannabis didn't fit with my lifestyle anymore but struggled to let it go.

This week I've been making friendship bracelets and sending them off in the post to my friends! I've realised I used to do little crafts all the time back before my addiction, but I guess using weed was so fulfilling I've not felt any need to persue crafts. Another thing I've noticed: I've not been a slave to sugary foods, always thinking about the next smoke and the next cookie took up A LOT of my thinking time.

I have a therapist I can speak to weekly and I'm also thinking of joining drugs club again (the substance misuse clinic) and seeing if they're doing online services. I went there for a period of time and they are a great bunch. Amazing support groups and a wealth of knowledge too.

I am excited to find out who the girl is underneath the mask; cannabis numbed my boredom and frustration for 10 years. Who will I be with all that time reclaimed? All that money I won't be wasting. All the thinking power I'll regain.

I have a long history of eating disorders so this extra food really really fucks with my head and my body image, even if it's just an extra bowl of cereal at the end of the evening I am so overcome with guilt and self-hatred. I've also noticed my suicidal thought have accelerated in the past couple of months, perhaps because of COVID and my eating disorder thoughts becoming more overwhelming but I'm wondering whether weed is contributing to this. 

I've only been smoking regularly since september but I feel it overtaking me, feeling shaky or panicky when I can't pick up or whilst I'm waiting to pick up. I just don't like this hold it has on me, it's just another addiction/obsession to add to my eating disorder and I want to prove to myself I can do it. I just want to live a healthier and happier life because right now I don't see any point in living for very much longer if it's like this; making myself more broke from buying drugs I can't afford, not eating enough or too much, making myself throw up, self harming. This is just a spiral I have continued to fall down since I was 13 and now I am not only hurting myself physically and mentally but also finacially which adds a whole other level of stress and self-loathing.

Sorry for the pity party, I just need to get my shit together. I have been consistently trying to exercise and start drawing regularly again as an outlet instead of trying to smoke, but so far I've not got a day without weed in a few months.

Smoked the lot in one night and started absolutely hating myself for giving in, woke up the next day (So I thought) and kept beating myself up because I'd felt so good for quitting.

Strangest part was then.. I actually woke up, realised I was still dreaming and hadn't smoked at all!

Today marks the second week of my decision of abstaining from this plant and I‚Äôd like to share my insights that hopefully might help anyone going through this tumultuous journey.

Good news is that it gets better, I promise you. Even though I had some days where I felt the cravings so intensely, so much so that it was somewhat of a gravitational force, I realized that this is the where I needed to build resiliency against the cravings, especially since I discovered that I had a hard time coping with negative and intrusive thoughts and that I allowed the plant to medicate myself rather than truly heal myself inwards. 

What I also realized is how powerful the mind can be and how hard it is to navigate the sea of our thoughts, feelings, impulses, and actions. They say there is a stream of consciousness, well I‚Äôd like to think of it more as a torrent, and it takes a great deal of patience, discipline, and most importantly love to learn how to ride the inward waves that is your mind, essentially a lifelong journey of learning mindfulness, which the plant can mistakenly perceive itself as a way of achieving mindfulness, when in reality, it‚Äôs just smokes and mirrors. 

I also would like to express my gratitude to this community, I sometimes join the weekly discord chats and speaking to you all has been a blessing, since knowing I‚Äôm not alone, makes me feel like we all are in this together, wanting to heal, and maybe even have a healthier relationship to the plant or just bid our farewells. 

I‚Äôve also taken up practicing guitar more often, paying closer attention to school, and communicating more often with family and friends. All in all, I realized that learning how to practice mindfulness will help you overcome any addiction as it also marks my third month of abstaining from nicotine as well! 

You can do it, I promise, all you need to do is just believe and remember that you are worth working hard for. I love you all ‚ù§Ô∏è

I always thought the song was kind of dumb, or that I was too smart for it, but this morning it suddenly dawned on me that I actually had a negative gut reaction to this song because, well, because I don't, or didn't, want to take responsibility..

Hardly ever saying what I meant or standing up for myself because... well, I don't exactly know! Something inside me tells me there is some trauma I have repressed which is part of causing this intense separation anxiety, but I am still trying to figure it out. 

But! I was a smoker for ten years, and now I am over 2 years clean. So hurra for me? I have also stopped drinking and sort of giving the whole nofap thing a try, but I'm not sure it is for me. Maybe I am not a proud boy :/

So, I don't know. I was seeing a great therapist for a little while and this morning I was thinking maybe I should try to get a skype appointment, but I kept thinking about it since maybe I just wanted her to congratulate me on my progress, it seemed like a cheaper option to post here! haha. Also, feel free to ask me something, if you have any questions about whether or not it gets better or something, though spoiler alert, the answer will probably be yes.. 

The way it is for me now, I still have thoughts about smoking, subtle urges you might call them, but I am really nowhere near acting on them, at least that's what I think! I am working on better understanding myself, my emotional triggers, my feelings and thoughts and ye..

The worst part about being an addict for me was losing touch with reality and becoming way too superficial and not being able to connect with other people! Definitely the worst... Even worse than health effects etc.. and now I am doing the work to try and see if that is truly who I am, or if there is someone gentler, more loving underneath... I am hoping for the latter! haha

Hope YOU have a great day, wherever you are in the process, and like I said, if you are struggling right now and you question whether or not it will get better, I am almost hundred percent sure that the answer is yes :)

For me the quitting process has been both accelerated and sort of complicated by a horrible break up and a change in where I want to take my life in the future, so as I am writing this I am in the middle of dropping out of University to ""follow my dreams"" and having to figure out how the f to do that with no real coping skills or job skills or emotional intelligence to speak of. haha

main points: 

‚Ä¢ a huge reason why i quit was so that i could be and feel more productive during the day. i‚Äôm not. i feel like i‚Äôm just passing time and wasting my life even more than i was before somehow. 

‚Ä¢ i don‚Äôt care about much, and if i get a twinkle of interest it goes as soon as it came. i‚Äôve pretty much always struggled with this, but it‚Äôs gotten incredibly worse since quitting. 

‚Ä¢ night time fucking sucks. not just because of the no sleep, but because ive been wanting to get stupidly self destructive at night. craving everything i‚Äôve ever had a problem with, and craving it very bad. it really worries me. i‚Äôm so frustrated. 

‚Ä¢ i havent gotten more than 5 hours of sleep since i quit. and no matter how hard i try i cannot nap. i am so fucking tired i feel like i‚Äôm going to lose it soon. 

‚Ä¢ branching off of the no sleep/night time points, i end up just fixating on my trauma if my brain has nothing to think about. this happens during the day too, but i am so much more capable handling it effectively. at night time i feel so much worse and so frustrated which just makes every bad thing/craving more intense. i hate not feeling like i have a relatively safe ‚Äòout‚Äô when i need it. i hate not being able to trust if i‚Äôll actually be able to stick to only using it at night when i need it. 

i think those are my main issues right now. despite being very ‚Äòblah‚Äô during the day, i don‚Äôt find i‚Äôm craving cannabis that much. when i‚Äôm feeling shitty or triggered i feel like i‚Äôm equip to work through it or that i can wait it out, i dont even het frustrated that i dont have weed as an out in those moments. it‚Äôs making me doubt this whole all or nothing quitting thing big time. i so badly want to believe that it‚Äôs okay for me to only smoke before bed like literally when i take my medicine, but im scared of fucking up again. i‚Äôm so scared of disappointing people again and for them to think i gave up. i dont know. i just wish i was less problematic maybe haha

PROS/CONS,"So I used to smoke the bong 6-7 times every single day, starting in the morning and all the way to bed for 4-5 years straight. I have been sober for 3 months and what I have felt I have to share with you guys.

Pros:

* Mental clarity. I can focus on my passions without having negative thoughts every couple of hours to smoke.
* I dont lash out at my loved ones and I think through negative situations more rationally
* I face my problems and deal with them without using weed to cope. It gave me so much growth as a person to actually face these issues.
* My bank account thanks me and I used all the money I have and started investing. My investments have been a steady income for me!!
* I found friends who genuinely care about me and cut out the negative ones who were using me to keep up with their bad habits (smoking daily)
* I love myself more and happy to look at the man in the mirror
* I started substituting my weed intake with vitamins and my body thanks me, I feel so much more alive
* I started working out and actually loving it. I workout to clear my mind and found love in the process
* I dont eat out as much as often and I've learned to cook and enjoy my food slowly instead of mindlessly munching through it
* I view the world as its happening FOR me and not TO me. I stopped playing the victim that the world was against me and that I was just an addict.
* I've learned so much about myself and what drives me and what makes me truly happy.
* My dreams are crazy, random but truly inspiring.
* I sleep earlier and wake up earlier. Ironic right? Weed made me sleep in, it made me a lazy zombie.
* I am so motivated and happy to get out of bed, instead of mindlessly scrolling through my phone.
* I am more confident and have no trouble with conversations and eye contact. (I used to be so shy I avoided talking to people, even if they talked to me first)
* I'm a better version of myself, which means I show up as a better version of myself to everyone I love.
* I found love in reading and self-development so much that I hold myself to such a high standard. I'm not saying I'm the best in the world and I never will. Im saying to only be 1% better than the person you were yesterday.
* I have deep conversations about life, goals, aspirations and amazing topics with my friends. Instead of sitting around, getting high, watching TV and munching.

Cons

* I don't listen to music as much nor love it as much but its okay, because I replaced them with podcasts that make me feel better and actually LEARN something every day.
* I lost alot of friends, but honestly who cares. They held me back and never cared about me or my goals. They just used me as an excuse to keep smoking. I will never look back.
* I dont watch Netflix anymore, so I'm paying for something I dont even use.

The pros definitely outweigh the cons. I believe in you!. And FYI this is my experience, yours may be very different. But I'm glad I can share this with you all. ",181,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9224898}"

Good job. Wife and 2 kids. And a whole lot of serious mental and emotional problems I self medicated for, even after seeing a therapist and getting on proper medications.

Then the panic attacks started. The first two were Covid/mask/people related (yep a hypochondriac too during a pandemic). Those got under control relatively quickly. The next day I got another from emotional stress and that lingered with chest tightness for about 2 days.

I (23M) developed a bad relationship with weed about two and a half years ago, September, when I got a dab pen while in college. Thought it was cool to be so discrete and easy... Turns out that I immediately started abusing it to lie to numb the pain of being in an emotionally abusive relationship I couldn't get out of. When I tried to break up with her around this time, she threatened to kill herself and I didn't have the strength to go through with the breakup after that. The weed numbed me and helped me lie to myself that the situation I was in was okay.

Fast forward a few months, March, I recognize that I have a legitimate problem with weed, smoking whenever I eat, go to the gym, do anything really. So I try to stop but... I can't. I fail and give up trying to quit after a somewhat half-assed attempt. The relationship is still going on and I lie to myself that the situation is okay.

Fast forward another few months, summer hits and I have to fly back home away from my gf. She guilted me into letting her come to live at home with me and my parents during the summer, even though I knew on the inside I didn't want that. But I was so scared that she would kill herself, she made me think that she was dependent on me. This is when I went from smoking a lot to smoking 24/7. My gf started fights all the time and guilted me all the time for stupid shit... She even told me that she liked me better when I'm high. I knew I had a weed problem and I even tried to tell her I have a weed addiction a few times so that I could have some support in getting off of it (people still have no clue I have this problem, I'm very locked up about it). She told me every time that there's no such thing as a weed addiction. I believed her because I wanted to, even though deep inside I know I'm addicted to weed.

Fast forward to the school year, I go back down and she stays up with my parents for reasons. This is when the relationship with her really started to break down. I was her rock, her entire emotional support and I was always strong for her. But being away from her during this time was hell, she was constantly mentally unhealthy and I was really starting to break too, so I couldn't help her out as much. She didn't offer the same support to me. A nasty fight happens between us and after a month I finally got her to break up with me (I was too weak to do it myself). This entire quarter I'm smoking 24/7 still with no attempt to quit

Now I'm out of the relationship, thank god, and it's December 2019. I also happened to graduate during this quarter early my senior year, so I come back home to live with just my parents. It's a great time to heal from the relationship, god I needed to heal from that. I also made my first legitimate effort of quitting weed around Christmas. I kicked it for about a week, before getting another pen thinking I could control it. I'm out of the relationship and the relationship is what made me abuse the weed right?? It was never going to be that easy

I make another attempt in March, around when quarantine starts. But the constant doom and state of the world/country, being at home with parents with no job and no job market so I'm bored as fuck with nothing to do, all of that made me go back after 8 days sober.

Since then I've made a couple feeble attempts to quit that didn't last more than a day, but last month I got hired at a fast paced tech job. My career is starting! Buuuut, I'm still smoking 24/7 unbeknownst to my parents. The job will get me to kick it naturally right??

No. Became functional weed addict at work. I've fucking had it at this point, I've made so many excuses to myself, putting off kicking the addiction, lying to myself about what caused the addiction. I bought a Kitchen Safe and threw my ID in on Wednesday. Can't get it back until Saturday at the earliest, which will be day 10 for me. Day 1 was the hardest for me, and I have no idea what's in store for my future regarding the drug. I still feel addicted to it and I feel so anxious and unsettled at all times. I'm likely going to extend the time on the kitchen safe until I think I can have my ID and not go buy weed. This is going to be a rough journey gang, but I'm really truly trying to take the steps to get this monkey off my back. 

Thank you for anyone who reads this, you don't know how much even that means to me right now. And sorry if any of this is incoherent, I needed to ramble all this out to someone",18,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5784527}"
2021-01-25 21:23:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/l53yfw/60_days_sober_some_advice/,60 days sober. Some advice,"Hi all, been around this subreddit for a while and just wanted to post some advice that has helped me get to where I am.

The first thing I'll recommend is considering going into rehabilitation. I found an recovery program that I do through Zoom. I meet for group therapy 3 times a week for three hours but eventually that will go down. I meet with an individual counsellor once a week as well. I spend 10 hours a week at the moment in community focusing on my sobriety. I wouldn't be where I am without this. I understand this isn't possible for some, as I am lucky enough to have health insurance that covers this (it is out of network, but I was able to use my flex spending account to pay). If you have the potential to do this, can spare money (mine is $1500 for the year, daunting but you likely spend >$3000 on pot per year if you were like me), and finding a way to quit is important to you, don't hesitate to try to find a place to get help. I am using LionRock Recovery which has people from all over the US meeting. I'm unsure if they accept internationally, but it is possible.

Something I had to accept was that I wasn't quite strong enough where I was to do this alone. It is very hard once your chemically addicted. There is a false narrative that weed isn't addictive out there and this is untrue. I believe I read that 9-12% of users get addicted. It is difficult to quit but possible.

The second thing I'd recommend that has been a savior for me has been my daily mediation practice. I specifically have turned to Buddhism to help me through this time. This may a turn off for some, but some form of mindfulness mediation and especially a daily practice (or just semi-regularly to start if daily is intimidating) has been so crucial to staying sane during this practice. I'm able to see cravings as exactly that, cravings, and know that they will pass and that I can handle it. 

I sat on this subreddit for about two years trying on and off to quit, posting here and there. To be honest, looking back, I didn't find it very effective. The one positive thing was knowing that I wasn't alone and knowing that this is a real issue that many are facing. Besides that I think much of my time here was self-destructive. All I'd do was see people posting success stories and feel bad about myself leading into a cycle of sadness and self-criticism which lead to more smoking. I'm not saying this subreddit won't work for some and be supportive, but there may be some of you here that we're like me and may be self-sabotaging without knowing it. Not to mention reading comments about how hard it is, and occasional unregulated glorification of the drug. It's important to replace smoking with healthy habits. Reading about people quitting/struggling to quit smoking on reddit really isn't a good replacement for smoking. Reading, walking, playing/listening to music, writing, learning a new skill, watching sports, meditation, etc. These are healthy habits that are sustainable and will support your sobriety.

I tried to quit many many times over a two year period but these two things are the main drivers in my success in sobriety. I also haven't drank as it is important to maintain this period of sobriety as I let my brain reacclimate to prior level of dopamine, not risk a new addiction in alcohol, an arguably worse addiction to be facing, and to rediscover myself as a person and face some demons, something I desperately needed to do to get clean.

I hope this helps someone. There is definitely a path for some of us to get clean without my advice, don't resort to all-or-nothing thinking if you can't go into recovery or don't like meditation. But for those who think those options may work for them, I highly recommend them, as they were pathways to success for me. I'm not looking back now and look forward to many many sober days. I have been the most productive I've been in years (which isn't all that productive compared to most, but hey, it's progress), I'm getting back into old hobbies that weed took over and I feel good about myself for the first time in years. You can be there too. Thanks for reading.

So I'm on Day 83 and my life hasn't really gotten that much better. I quit in the first place because mentally I wasn't great and I contributed that to weed but now I'm not so sure. I don't know if 

1. Weed was never the true problem and it was just something else
2. Weed did in fact cause the problem but it may have caused permanent brain damage so quitting doesn't matter since the damage is already done or
3. I'll be completely okay if I keep pushing through.

I also question if no. 1 and 2 are just the addiction trying to lure me back in, but I'm just getting extremely discouraged being on day 83 and I still haven't found noticeable improvement. In fact, quality of life has gone down, I just keep waiting for the day that it goes back to normal

I really didn't have much of an issue resisting the drug the first few weeks because I experienced what I think was depersonalization and I didn't even have any motivation to go get more. My motivation has been better here recently but still piss poor. It's been getting harder and harder to resist, though, because the whole reason I smoked in the first place was to relieve depression and I keep going back and forth in my mind. I think that I should just power through the depression so I can become better at coping without the use of drugs, but then the depression gets so bad that I get some really deep and suicidal thoughts and I know the only thing at the moment to make me feel better is smoke. It's a shitty dilemma and I know I need a therapist to talk to but I'm having trouble getting to one right now so I'm just typing on reddit as a substitute in the meantime, I guess.

My husband and I have been smoking everyday (pretty much all day between bong hits and nighttime joints) for the last 8-9 years? We recently moved into a new apartment at the start of the year and have really been happy here. Consequently, we completely stopped smoking as we just didn‚Äôt have the need /desire for it anymore. This is the longest we‚Äôve gone and honestly I don‚Äôt see us going back, there‚Äôs just been so many more pros than cons and we‚Äôre really happy that we‚Äôve been able to stick through it for so long and learn new coping mechanisms for things that once made us stressed and/or incredibly anxious. 

Anyways- I also just started my period about 2 days ago. I was 6 days late this past cycle and was really hoping to be preggers as we‚Äôve been wanting to conceive for the last 8 months or so. Sadly, my period did show up and in FULL FORCE. I‚Äôve never gotten cramps this bad and I have also never had this extra heavy of a flow. I‚Äôm talking heavy as in having to change my pads every hour or so. It‚Äôs been tough! 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is a common withdrawal symptom or not but I did read some articles online that THC can impact your hormones/cycle. Wondering if anyone has experienced this? I did read another post about a woman who had heavy periods for the first 3 months after quitting and then everything regulated itself out.

Im starting to feel more clear headed, more positive, more hopeful, more energetic. Along with all that came some productivity but Im struggling to stay focused on a single task. My adderall (prescribed for 8 years now) works better but causes some side effects like agitation. 

Ive identified this focus issue as a trigger. Inability to focus causes anxiety and irritability and then I smoke. Those feelings get relief and I end up more productive than ever when I smoke but it's a very chaotic sort of zig-zaggy focus. I end up staying up too late ignoring my needs for food, sleep, etc for the sake of being productive. 

I'm struggling to keep focused on writing this post right now. Been back and forth several times trying to write this thing. 

I know what I have to do though. Exercise. 

I don't drink excessive amounts of caffeine, just tea but I'm sensitive to it. I don't use a lot of nicotine but I'm sensitive to that as well. I have plans to discontinue Adderall in the next year. I don't take a high dose so it should be easy but since I quit smoking the side effects are more noticeable. 

Reasons I'm not giving into my cravings for weed right now: the boost in focus won't last and aren't guaranteed. I'm more likely to get anxious and couch-locked. If it does help, I'll end up smoking again to try to get that focus boost. I'll end up smoking regularly because I'll depend on the weed to help me get things done. Then my sleep will get messed up and I'll be back to square one trying to quit again.

This lead to me getting a pen. Smoking carts when I couldn't smoke bud. Eventually, as most addictions do, this really just spiraled out of control. Instead of school, I'd work on rolling joints for myself in the bathroom, so excited for when I could go smoke one. It took up much of my time, as well as so much money. my friends often told me to slow down, that I was an addict, but for a long time I absolutely would not admit that I was a pothead. im supposed to be the smart, athletic, varsity starter, I thought to myself. but I was just fooling myself.that;s the type I had been my whole life, but I transformed from working out everyday and being a decent A/B student to a lazy pothead who half assed all their school work and always planned out when would be my next high. how to get away with it. what method of smoking it would be. where would I go smoke. how would I cover the smell. make sure I have visine. hand sanitizer. breath mints and gum. it was stressful, but I couldn't stop. and when I realized that, that is when I realized I had a problem. but I still loved so I kept it going until I got caught. the only reason I don't smoke anymore is BECAUSE I got caught. if I hadn't gotten caught, im convinced that I would still be smoking weed non stop, wasting my teen years to that.

&#x200B;

So basically what im here to say and ask.. does it get easier? I have not smoked for 30 days now, so im almost a month clean which is great, but the desire is there every day. today I feel so stupid, because I literally missed smoking so bad that I decided to use a gum wrapper and put tea inside of it and roll a joint out of it. I took the stupid joint to one of my fav smoke spots and, its embarrassing to say, I just sat there and smoked tea. I feel absolutely crazy... why am I like this? why can't I let go. or in better words, how can I let go, because I know I can but its very difficult to do. im really just asking for some advice, any would be appreciated.

My addiction to weed is ruining multiple aspects of my life. I‚Äôm a 28yo(F) and I‚Äôve been a stoner/high functioning alcoholic/addict for all of my twenties. No one knew until recently because I was able to hide it so well for so long, and I look like a sorority girl on the outside. 

Today is day 4 off of alcohol and day 3 off of weed after so many day 1s before. I was a high achiever growing up, graduated college with honors and have always been able to hold a good job and pay my own bills since graduating. BUT the disease caught up to me the past 3 years, and I‚Äôm certainly not living up to my potential. I‚Äôve also lost a lot of friends because I isolate myself when high. I gave up my hobbies bc I‚Äôd rather be getting high, and my anxiety and depression got so unbearable I contemplated ending my life. Since early 2018, I‚Äôve been high on edibles at work almost daily, yet somehow still getting promotions and raises and never getting caught, so I thought I was fine. When my addiction reached it‚Äôs worst during 2020, I started spending close to $3,000 a month on edibles alone because weed is legal where I live, and I figured out you can pay with a credit card at many places. However, I don‚Äôt make enough to spend that much on weed, so I began to go into debt because of my habit. I was also drinking 2-3 bottles of wine a day on top of all the edibles I was taking which was anywhere between 100mg-1000mg a day. Yes, one day I even ate 1000mg of THC and didn‚Äôt even get high. I should have definitely stopped then. 

I‚Äôve taken like 4 tolerance breaks in the past few years and my withdrawals are insane with headaches, insomnia, and no appetite to the point where smelling food makes me gag. Though it may be more psychological than physical, the addiction is real and it can happen to anyone. Finally, I‚Äôm done escaping my feelings. After a decade of giving my life to substances, I‚Äôm so so ready and willing to be sober for good. Here‚Äôs to the beginning of my new and improved sober life. :)",144,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.58937865}"

Felt awesome but got triggered and fell back into it.  Now I‚Äôm on day 3, and I actually feel better able to handle the withdrawal verses the first time, probably because when I quit the first time, it was after 10+ years of daily smoking with a few short breaks scattered in there. 

It seems like my body goes into ‚Äúdetox mode‚Äù quite fast now. For instance, day 1 till now I‚Äôve been sweating like craaazy while I sleep. However, I don‚Äôt feel as out of sorts as I did the first time during those first few days. Irritable maybe, and re-exposed to suppressed feelings, but since I‚Äôve already encountered those feelings a few months ago, experiencing them again just feels like reacquainting myself with someone I haven‚Äôt seen in a while. 

My guilt complex, for instance, reintroduced itself to me this morning upon waking up. I really wanted to just smoke, and even browsed my local dispensary for a non-smokable cannabis option. Decided against it (thank God).

My dog helped though. I finally took her out on a walk in the snow like her little heart wanted this morning (poor thing had to deal with my grumpiness). I yelled at her this morning because her chipper energy was ready first thing in the morning for her walk, and she nagged me out of excitement, and it contrasted so intensely with my bunk ass energy. It was so sad, I realized after I yelled at her that she was pouting on the couch and she looked so depressed.. she reminded me of myself..

And I thought ‚Äúno way.. no way am I ever  again going to force a pure hearted being to adapt to my depression just to not ruffle my feathers.‚Äù My selfishness. 

I‚Äôve decided that when she wants her walk in the morning, I‚Äôm going to adapt myself to her energy and try to get on her wavelength. Because truthfully, being out and about and even dealing with the uncomfortable cold it‚Äôs revitalizing and stimulating. I feel so much better afterwards. 

I went to the pet store and bought her a delicious ham bone which she is currently outside enjoying (plus crickets for my bearded dragon‚Äî both are quite pleased today). I‚Äôm glad I have her in my life to remind me not to be such a self-absorbed brat. It feels good making other people happy, including my pets.

Lack of appetite. I got one of those pre-planned meal plans and I was really excited about it before but it‚Äôs like I had to force myself to get it down. I felt almost nauseated eating and thinking about food. Still struggling with this. 

Irritable. I had a fit of rage over losing rice which resulted in my crying on my kitchen floor... yeah. And depression has been enhanced. This weekend I was so freaking depressed like I can‚Äôt even describe how shit I felt. And enhanced anxiety too. Fun stuff. 

Cravings. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, this hasn‚Äôt been easy. I even hit up my dealer but by some act of grace he didn‚Äôt reply. I scrounged up as much weed crumbs and tar as I could and tried to smoke... luckily it didn‚Äôt work. I was so desperate, it‚Äôs sad. Then I bought a bunch of beer to fill the void when normally I don‚Äôt drink. I really want to learn to be content without mind altering substances! 

Headache/feel icky. I have had a headache and I just feel off. Like not sick exactly but almost how you feel when your body is fighting something. Sluggish, head hurts and neck feels weird almost a nausea type feel. Tired. Don‚Äôt know how to explain but isn‚Äôt pleasant. 

Now for the positives! 

Clearer. I haven‚Äôt been waking up with this heavy hangover feeling which is nice although I still feel like I‚Äôm lacking energy and motivation a little. 

Better self image. I‚Äôm proud of myself for not giving in and actually dealing with my emotions (maybe not in the best way but I‚Äôm purging and feeling them out) 

I‚Äôm reading. I read a lot whenever I stop smoking. It‚Äôs one of my hobbies but I always neglect whenever I‚Äôm in a period where I smoke daily. I‚Äôm really happy to be getting back into this and I downloaded a bunch of books I‚Äôm excited to delve into. 

Eating better. When I don‚Äôt have the munchies I eat so much healthier and less and overall feel better, I‚Äôm not all bloated and lethargic from eating everything in my kitchen cabinet.

I turned 25 two days ago, and today is my 2nd day of sobriety. I have been smoking hash, since I live in Lebanon, since I was 15 with not a single day skipped.

It started out with me hanging out with the wrong people and since my entourage was people who smoked, I never quit. I'll be honest, I won't put the blame only on my entourage. I always said that it is essential in one's life, I literally couldn't do anything without it, actually preferred not to do anything without it. I have always been a straight A student, and because I consistently kept on getting my A's even as a heavy smoker, it kind of convinced me that it is okay!

I have always had problems with my parents, my mom always throwing my shit out, me fighting with her, then buying the same day, I feel ashamed as I'm writing this. I never was able to look at my dad in the eye because everytime I came back home, my eyes were bloodshot. My mom, younger sister and brother knew of my smoking habits and I always felt that I could never be a role model. I didn't want them to be looking up to a brother who was high all the time, yet I never quit.

A couple weeks ago I joined the community and read several posts that really made me cry, legit cry, and it was then when I started to feel like enough is enough. Regardless of the posts I was reading, I continued to smoke up but slowly decreasing my intake from 6 joints a day, to 2 joints. I also told my mom and my girlfriend, my biggest two supporters of my intent on quitting, yet the moment all my supply was finished, I left home, went to the dealers, and bought a small amount. 

I then went to my girlfriend's place and she was surprised how I still had shit on me, I lied and said I found some stashed up in a drawer. When I came back home, mom was surprised and I lied that I found them at my girlfriend's place. Lying killed me yet for some reason I kept on smoking. On my birthday, I smoked the last joint. 

The next morning, I felt that I had to BE the role model my siblings needed, so I had an heart to heart conversation with my siblings saying it was wrong of me to be doing that all of those years and I apologized to them. At that moment, I felt 25 hit different and I'm starting to become a new person. 

Last night was hell! I was not able to fully go to sleep, I felt that I was asleep and awake the whole night it was really tough. During the day it's fine but it's the night time that worries me the most. Tonight like last night, I will not be smoking but I hope I'll have a better sleep. 

I feel proud of myself for being able to share this, maybe encourage people to quit as some posts really gave me the courage to quit. 

Thank you all for taking time to read this, maybe it was not worth your time but I feel like I took something off my chest.

Weed has provided me a cocoon of comfort these last 5 years of smoking about 90%+ of the days. I have been a ‚Äúfunctioning pothead‚Äù, at least that is what I like to think. I go on the (very) occasional T-break and that is about it. I do not smoke until after work or family plans, but if I have nothing going on during a day where everyone I see would be my buddies or classmates, I am high all day. I went to class high at least a third of the time, and most non-scholastic experiences in college I did while high. I graduated from college with good grades which could have been better. I found a full-time job in the pandemic that I am starting up with now, not my dream job but something that pays off with work ethic above the norm. I have kept my other side occupations active, and always decided those would maintain my productivity threshold along with not allowing me to get high until afterwards for those 3 ‚Äì 4 days a week. I found a productive hobby that I am fascinated in, spend a lot of time on, and excel in, even while high. I can hit my productivity threshold with weed. But I have decided life is not about hitting a threshold or being good enough to get by. I want to exceed expectations, pursue my jobs with an extra vigor, pursue my side projects with intent. Why do things at 75% of maximum potential with weed rather than 100% without. I need to improve my relations with my family, friends, and change my current slide into introvert territory back to extrovert. I am far more social without weed, can truly have a captivating conversation without weed, and overall I like who I am more without weed. I need to clear the morning fog from my brain, which only seems to get worse with every waking morning after a long night of smoking. I need to read, listen to podcasts, pursue my side projects from evening until bedtime rather than getting high and being content doing nothing. I want to wake up at 7am, not 10am; I want to be asleep by 11pm, not 1am. I want to exercise daily, eat healthy, save money. I want to attack the areas I have my toes dipped into and jump in fully. I want to live a life without drugs being an outlet. I want to save money from weed expenses and spend that money on vacations, experiences, and items to improve my quality of life rather than diminish and blur it. I want to bring meditation, yoga, and stretching into my daily routine. I want to join the local gym right across my street and meet new friends there, rather than getting an inferior workout alone at home watching people walk in and out of those gym doors. I want to floss and brush my teeth thoroughly every night, rather than brushing for 10 seconds and passing out. I know that may sound odd, but it is the little things, the last leg of each daily task, which weed limits heavily. We only live one life and I intend to live it to the fullest, feel it to the fullest, go through ups and downs on my own and without a drug up my sleeve to nullify emotions. Now feels like make-or-break time at 23 years old: live a content life with weed by my side or challenge myself every day to be the best human I can be. I cannot maximize myself with weed. With weed, I can enjoy the moment with friends, do what I need to do in my occupations, pursue my side projects with some intent, exercise a few times a week, read once in a blue moon, and do what I must in order to get by. But that is not enough, and those experiences aren't maximized under the haze of weed. I can take two steps forward during the day, and then one step back at night while I sit stoned on my couch doing nothing. Three steps forward is where I need to be. I have tried several times over the last few months to quit, but today is different. This is a true day 1. No better time than the present.

Grandpa and family all died from cancer, and my dad was adamant we would never smoke. Pretty decent athlete‚Äî had 4 marathons, a 50k and a half Ironman to my name. But, after an unsuccessful attempt at getting into Special Forces, a fianc√© who cheated on me after I failed, and my dad being diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer, I needed something so badly. Weed gave me that numb feeling, and throughout my Dad‚Äôs cancer diagnosis I just swan dived into substance abuse. I watched my dad go from a school superintendent to helplessly addicted to oxy and pain pills, shaking when he blazed through his shit too early and chemo got bad. I thought I was doing a good thing‚Äî smoking with my Dad to help ease some of his pain and just bullshitting about stuff we would have never talked about otherwise. He was so reluctant to try weed and I do think it helped to ease some of his pain when things got terminal. 

One day, his colon lining ruptured and he had to get airlifted to the hospital for an emergency colostomy bag procedure. I ripped two joints in the car after driving as fast as I could up to his hospital to see his botched procedure leave him with shit and blood all over his stomach. You never realize what ‚Äúpain‚Äù looks like until you see the person you love more than anyone in the world screaming for you to grab his hand and ‚ÄúPlease, God, just make it stop.‚Äù My brother and mom completely checked out, didn‚Äôt even stay at the hospital, while I stayed there and held his hand every day trying to be there. I was taught you never let someone suffer alone, and as much as it fucked me up to see everything I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything in the world. I think I burned an ounce in a few days, but at least I could be there and take some of that load off his yolk. 

You can guess the rest, but a week after he died I was back at work and assigned more responsibility than ever before. I smoked an ounce a week every week in secret, and just prayed to God I could hide it from work and told myself I was just ‚Äúself soothing‚Äù. I would fly off the fucking handle if I couldn‚Äôt smoke, punching holes in anything I could find, trying to start fights with anyone who looked at me sideways, and generally just trying to fucking destroy myself and anything else in my miserable orbit. 

Its been a year and 6 months since he died. Thanks to a wife I don‚Äôt deserve on my best days, lurking on this forum, and a trip to Africa through work (where I saw what actual suffering and poverty looks like)‚Äî I have been sober for a week and tossed all my weed out.

The withdrawal was awful. I was irritable and cranky and thinking about lighting up every hour on the hour. After a few weeks I felt way better, and that turned into a few months. My focus sharpened, my skin cleared up, I got a cushy job and some new hobbies (bass guitar and biking woooo!)

Then I was laid off due to COVID-19. I had to take a retail job and wait tables. I fell back into it. Within a week I was wake-n-baking every day. I wanted to hide from it all behind a cloud of my own design. By the time 2021 rolled around, I was so scared that I would just be stuck in the past because I couldn't get my damn head out of the clouds. Then I got a job offer. Then my friends confessed that they liked me better when I'm sober. I admitted I liked myself better sober. 

So last week I gave a friend my contraband backpack. Although I am dealing with the withdrawal, I can honestly say I am excited to be rid of it. Thank you guys for being a little bit of inspiration.

The first month was only Fridays. Then Friday and Saturdays. It became a part of my life. I was a sporty, very social person who is biking 100km, running 20km at least a week. But became a person who is just smoking starting 8 pm in the evenings. First 6 months I literally abused. Eating 10 snickers, 1kg fruit, and 1-2 gram weed in a day until feel spoiled. My social life becomes empty. It was fun, the music, the taste of the fruit, everything was different. But not me.

When Covid started I started to smoke every day starting at 18:30. After dinner, the plan was pretty clear for me. Smoking, making music, reading books, watching some stuff on TV. At some point, it was not fun anymore. It just makes me kind of high, but noisy, buzzy feeling until I sleep, changed the strain a few times, it became worst. When I am on vacation the life was completely different. No sleep at all. I started to smoke every week at once or with friends together. 

So I decided to stop completely \~2 weeks ago. And I've experienced what is a ""panic attack"" the first time in my life. It was pretty bad and I felt I am going to die. Only 2-3 hours of sleep. Constant feeling of dry mouth. Feeling cold, sweating, loss of appetite, irritability, weird pain in my shoulders. Even diarrhea. Lost few kilograms.  Got the Covid test, it was negative.

Now the effects are gone. I am still not feeling 100% recovered. But the worst part is the end now.

I relapsed on the weekend when I have a date and we were talking about weed. I felt one of my best friends is gone and remembered how music sounds when I am smoking. But I also remembered the effects that I had. Didn't tried. Got a tobacco cigarette and I was done. 

After the weird withdrawal effects, I decided to never go back. I am still missing, but my health is more important. 

I just wanted to share my experience because of the withdrawal effects that I had. It wasn't easy. Not to mention the positive effects I had after stop using it. Pretty clearly everything getting better. 

So if you gonna stop using it, be ready for withdrawal effects, and remember it's not just you.

I'm currently 18 but started smoking when I was 15. It isn't as long as some of the other users I've seen on here but I do feel like I have a severe problem with it. As a college student money is the most valuable thing someone like me can have, and spending ¬£100/week on bud is appalling in my eyes as I can be using that for so many other things.

 It took me a while to realise I had a problem, I had this mindset of 'hah weed isn't addictive, stuff like heroin and cocaine is!' but oh boy how wrong was I. You never realise you're addicted until someone points out how much money you've been spending, or how much they dislike your drug use and how many problems it can cause.

I suffer from a lot of anxiety and depression, so stopping any substance that relieves that is pretty hard for me, but the benefit of stopping FAR outweighs the benefit of still smoking. In my friend group Im surrounded by a lot of people who think weed isn't addictive but that mindset clearly does not help me so I've had to distance myself away otherwise I fear I may turn back to using it. Being high was such an important aspect of my life but now it's time for me to grow up, get my education back on track and reclaim my life.

I crave the thought of weed and sitting around with a bunch of mates just passing a bong under the sun or stars. Nothing has changed my performance at work as dropped by a lot.   
My girlfriend has forced me to change or she'd leave me I promised people around me I would make this year different but in the back of my mind I feel just as if I'm 19 years old.

Since being sober (and quitting video games at the same time) I feel like an entirely different person. 
I have so much passion, energy, and rage that I feel constantly unstoppable and uncontainable. 
I can decide to do anything I want without any resistance: studying, working out, journaling, reading etc. 
I wake up before 7:00am every day with no alarm and i am excited and energized until I go to bed that night. (I also have a very strict healthy diet which consists almost entirely of vegetables and fruits which I think contributes to this)

However as soon as I smoked weed everything changed.... all of my emotions disappeared.... everything felt so different...
It was literally as if my psyche was replaced by an entirely different person who didn‚Äôt care about any of my desires or goals and instead wanted nothing but to sink away and disappear from reality. 

Even the morning after I smoked it was clear a piece of myself was missing: my boundless energy and passion for life and being myself was simply nonexistent. I went from being a manic psychotic force of passion and instead became complacent and numb husk. 
I eventually forced myself to go outside and go on a run at 3pm just hoping that I could bring some sort of intense feeling back. It helped a bit but I think it will be impossible to reach my previous emotional state until I at least get one more entire day of sobriety under my belt and maybe even a few more

I absolutely fucking hate the person I become when I am high. It is literally the antithesis of the person that I actually am.

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been abusing this shit since I was 16.... 
I‚Äôm never going back. The way I feel without it is like being on my own personal amphetamines all the time.

First of all I wanted to say that this sub reddit played a big role in my decision to quit,and I'm very thankful for that, never thought I'd get to write here as someone who's stopped using, things are so much better than I thought it's unbelievable. 

I'm writing this post at 5am after waking up from what most would call a nightmare, SOAKING WET, which is the real annoying part, I don't really mind the dreams. 

Just like everyone, I started to get vivid dreams after not having any kind of dream for about 3 years.
This is fine but I started sweating like crazy at nights, when my sleep is not interrupted and I make it to the morning I wake up sticky/clammy like I know I sweated a lot through the night, on other nights, like tonight, I wake up WET, in the middle of night and it never happened while I was smoking or even before that, zero problems with sweating or waking up in the middle of the night (I always had a difficulty falling asleep, but once I'm asleep, I SLEEP and usually have difficulty waking up and getting out of bed)

I'm not complaining too much even though it is annoying especially when I'm not used to having problems staying asleep.


THE POINT:üëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

However, the first step is to realize this. I am proud of myself as I have now been off the greens for 2+ months. This is substantially longer than any other attempt to quit I have ever endured and I partially owe that success to this supportive community. 

I have noticed on the weekends I have been willing to drink a couple beers far more often that I ordinarily would. My true vice is cannabis as I have never really used alcohol to suppress my feelings. Although I very rarely drink enough to get intoxicated, I'd use a couple beers to simply stop my racing mind. Even with the occasional brewski, I am processing many more thoughts than I was when I was taking bong rips from sun up to sun down. However, the benefits from not smoking weed all rely around feeling and processing emotions you were suppressing. I know it's common to find new vices when giving up an addiction (good or bad) however it is extremely important to avoid the bad ones. 

When your lonely or bummed out and have a craving, there is so much growth available if you push through and analyze it. We are not our feelings, and we are not our cravings; as time passes you will be much more happy with yourself for staying clear. Using substances to process feelings is lame. If you are like me, and using other vices to keep up a streak, realize you are not maximizing your growth and may just be digging a different hole. I have plenty of healthy vices, but I (like many others) have a mind that doesn't stop thinking. I know I have to exercise a ridiculous amount to naturally keep my mind at ease, so that what I'll do from now on!  

Why are you feeling sad, lonely or depressed? There is likely a cause and you feeling those emotions is the first step to overcoming them. Suppressing them with any vice is only a step back and not worth it.

Mostly flowers but some vape stuff towards the end. I just kinda threw my shit out a few months back and decided I needed to move on. I wasn't doing as well at work (for unrelated reasons) and I had been thinking about it awhile. I tried doing ""just weekends"" and that became Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I just don't have the self control, and I'm ok admitting that.

The first week or two was tough - weed was my end of day ""break"" that took the edge off work (I'm a director in the advertising space), so I kinda felt like I didn't have anything to look forward to. I felt anxiety, some depression.

Things got progressively better and I noticed that it wasn't on my mind as much anymore. I felt too proud to move on to relapse. I told myself how good it was to make this change, friends etc, so I almost guilt-proofed myself into preventing going back. 

5 months later and i don't have that feeling much anymore. I'll have a beer every now and again, but not a huge drinker anyway. I haven't replaced the habit with another bad habit, in fact I've progressively gotten more productive and made a lot of new habits. I was an athlete and was always in pretty good shape, but in the last few years the gym was a must, otherwise I'd noticeably get a lil round. My metabolism ain't what it used to be!

I add new layers onto my routine over time, little improvements here and there. The big change from quitting weed was - I wasn't stoned and alert at night, which kept me awake on weekdays till 12-2am. I'd then sleep until 815-830, then roll out of bed, grab coffee, and try to wake up while starting the workday (830am start).

I now get in bed at around 930-10, and wake at about 6. I wake, make coffee, read 15-20 pages of a biz book, play a game or two of madden, then work out (peloton app, no bike), shower, and I'm in work mode right at 830am when we start. I feel more aware of my to do list, I don't forget little details as easily, and I really do feel my memory has gotten much better. Video games are a nice outlet from a fun standpoint, a good break to take the edge off. 

I'm not a perfect human being, but my life feels much better now that I'm on this current path. 

I wish I could grab a hit here and there on the weekends but honestly I don't even want to open that door. I spent more than a decade smoking every day, I think I got my fill and it's best if I just walk away completely. If anything, maybe I'll revisit when I'm nearing retirement and my future kids are grown up.

I smoked for the better part of 10yrs and at the end I just woke up to the reality of my situation.
Me and my friends weren't weird stoner teens anymore, we were closer to 30 and seriously addicted to weed.
It went from a few joints on the weekend to a joint several times a day, skipped class, skipped work, avoided friends who didn't like smoking etc etc.
And even worse my mental health went up with that smoke.
I slept horribly, I went from extroverted and creative to introverted and lazy.
I was ashamed, I felt isolated, misunderstood, deeply depressed.
I was stuck, in a lifestyle and an addiction.
I hated it all.

As I said, I woke up, one day I just couldn't take it anymore.
Applied to community college and I stopped smoking completely a month later.

Best decision I'd made in years.
Met new people, found new hobbies, learned interesting things and as luck would have it, met a fantastic woman who'd later become my fiancee.

I am around 2.5yrs away from that decision now and I remember more from those years than the 10yrs prior.

And my reason for telling you all this? I'm not sure.
I guess it's to shine a light on an addiction and a drug which has side effects I've felt the weed friendly culture we live in doesn't really want to talk about.

I‚Äôve been contemplating quitting weed for a while now and came across this forum. I‚Äôm currently in my early 30‚Äôs and have been smoking weed on and off since I was 17/18. I say on and off in a sense that I was a daily smoker and would cut back slightly or have extremely heavy periods of smoking.
I‚Äôve always found weed to be something holding me back but I‚Äôve never felt I‚Äôve missed out on large opportunities because of it. I‚Äôm working at a well paying job with a fairly large amount of responsibility that I manage. However, I‚Äôm smoking weed every single night and all day on the weekends.

Growing up, I was an angry kid. I don‚Äôt know what it was but weed kinda helped me mellow out. Not to mention helped deal with whatever was eating at me. I have noticed the pattern of depression playing into my usage and how it pushes me to take a little off the edge and get high.

Leaving glassblowing and starting a new career was one of the toughest transitions I've ever made. I started going to therapy and learned that I had no real coping skills and was developmentally delayed from smoking so much over the years.

It took a while and many relapses but I've been sober for about a year now. After fully detoxing, it just wasn't the same experience smoking again. In addition I'd started a job with a lot of responsibilities and it would make me paranoid to think I could be contacted for work at any time. 

If you would have asked me 2 years ago, I never would've believed that smoking so much was exasperating my mental health issues. 

Overall, I'm glad I quit. With the money I've saved over the last 2 years seriously cutting back and quitting, I've saved enough money to put a down payment on a house.

Even though I'm making considerably less per hour, I have way more money than I ever had when I was a glassblower.

I used to be a very religious person and barely ever even drank alcohol, but that was more lack of enjoyment for it and the hangovers, so weed was a bit of a stretch I didn‚Äôt expect to walk down.

When I started college I wanted to be a teacher of history and religion, but fell out of love with studying history there because of the curriculum and also discovered a love of Philosophy, which expanded my then narrow mind to new experiences. I always liked the Steve Martin quote ‚ÄòIf you're studying geology, which is all facts, as soon as you get out of school you forget it all, but philosophy you remember just enough to screw you up for the rest of your life‚Äô and he‚Äôs not wrong, but it‚Äôs not damning. Studying Theology however, is a great way to lose faith too, let me tell you. So my worldview was askew.

It was about this time that I met my now best friend, and hung out with him and a big group of stoners. I couldn‚Äôt tell you the amount of times I sat around while they were getting high and was slightly jealous but, you know, smoking bad and all that. My best friend and I share our birthday and he asked me if I wanted to try weed for my 21st and I took him up on it because ‚Äòit‚Äôs not addictive‚Äô. I do not, for one moment, regret this decision as I‚Äôm a firm advocate for legalization, to be clear, I just wonder where I‚Äôd be without it now.

I didn‚Äôt want to touch J‚Äôs because of tobacco being rolled in (European smoking method) so I smoked only through a bong, but that wasn‚Äôt great because there‚Äôs no hiding what it is and it‚Äôs really tough on the throat. To save this becoming a novel, I started smoking with tobacco a year later on my next birthday while very drunk and sneaking a toke from my mate while she wasn‚Äôt looking. It was that point that I never took a break and was pretty much getting high on a nightly basis, some days as a whole, I‚Äôm now 32.

After all this, I graduated college, met the love of my life (also a smoker/toker) and moved to the other side of the world with her and am engaged to marry in a few months, all the while, smoking my brains out near nightly.

Weed isn‚Äôt legal here, so getting it isn‚Äôt difficult but it‚Äôs not readily available and there can be droughts. During these periods, the irritability, sweaty nights, lack of appetite, etc. would come each and every time, and I would literally scrape the dust off the bottom of our rolling box to get through the start of it. I know this was a mix of wanting the tobacco and the weed, so a double whammy of withdrawals, but every attempt to quit lasted until the next ‚Äòhey, X just said they can get us sorted‚Äô at which point I was biting my nails off in anticipation.

In the past year, it‚Äôs became a regular occurrence to run out, get irritable, find any reason to argue with my partner, not talk for a day, make up, get high again, wash, rinse, repeat and I just hit a wall a month ago when we got sorted with 2 O‚Äôs and I just knew, deep down, that it was my last hurrah with it.

I turned to my partner and said we have to quit. We have only ever had one sober year together and I‚Äôve hit my point where I want more out of life. She was very very hesitant but she saw my logic and we‚Äôre both trying together. When I said to her that in our entire relationship we never tried being sober together properly she woke up to it. I don‚Äôt want to be standing facing her on my wedding day and thinking about my next smoke, because on day‚Äôs off it‚Äôs wake-and-bake territory every time. 

I‚Äôve been off it now for just over a week, and already I have had more drive at work, more desire to chase my dream of writing and getting published, and more energy for those around me. One week! I can clearly see how much better off I am without it, but it‚Äôs been very very tough. I work a very stressful job and I‚Äôm still sitting here wishing there was a middle ground, so I can let my mind go blank after 7pm each night and not worry about a thing other than what‚Äôs on tv or whatever game I‚Äôm playing, but I know what I‚Äôm like. Once I get that fix, I‚Äôll chase it again, and go through the misery of quitting and withdrawals, the arguments, the non-break related internet surfing increasing at work, all of it.

It‚Äôs not the first attempt at this, nor the 10th, but this time is different, because it was such a conscious decision. We have a habit of weakening each others willpower through ‚Äòhow about I pop to X‚Äôs and just get the one because it‚Äôs been such a shit day‚Äô, but I‚Äôm standing strong and going cold turkey and really want to see this through.

I‚Äôm thankful to have found this subreddit because it can feel like a lot, having your brain slowly reawaken, and the evenings are an absolute killer still, but I think sharing my story and seeing the stories shared here will help me stay on track. It‚Äôs not that I hate the stuff, like I said I believe in legalization, but I think it‚Äôs very important to know that it can make you very very lazy and uninspired long-term, and if you don‚Äôt recognize that you can all of a sudden find yourself 10 years in and feel like you could have maybe done something a bit more meaningful with the time you spent with it and on the couch.

I needed to post to get some encouragement. Heavy and long term smoker. This time last year I was actually sober. I managed to quit for over 4 months and I've been chasing that feeling again. 2020 was pretty shit and unfortunately I ended up doing the devil's lettuce again. Something I'm trying not to shame spiral about again. I usually get away overseas a few times a year and it helps me to have breaks. I don't even think about smoking when I'm on holiday or doing different activities in a new place. Covid has definitely interrupted that. As a result I've had a really heavy smoking time in 2020 + this month

Work is bringing in more random drug tests and I hate the paranoia. We had one last week. I passed (it's just a swab) but it's not worth it. 

The biggest thing also I guess I got sexually assaulted by a teacher on placement and drove home under the influence several years ago in a panic. I crashed my car and am so fucking lucky to have walked away. It's given me extreme anxiety about driving. Smoking just compounds that tenfold.

I have conditions on my license and if I ever get caught dui it will totally fuck me. I was lucky I had a female police officer who didn't prese charges as I actually wanted to die at the time. As a result even when I haven't smoked I'm feeling way too paranoid to drive because what if something shows up from the other day. I only drive to work and the shops and if absolutely have to. This has really like. Limited what I have been doing. I was just on 6 weeks worth of holidays from work and barely went anywhere. It was not good. 

(Please I know I fucked up I don't need any more judgement about my actions. It's really complex trauma and the therapy which was provided by my university blamed me and so it's been a struggle to have faith in therapists. Ive been through mental health system a bit so I have just been working on it using DBT/CBT skills I've learnt over the years. I know I probably need professional help.... But then driving there.... It's a vicious cycle) 

I have been leaving the house less and less and having previously had agoraphobia (10+ years ago - didn't leave house for 18months) this is the first time I'm feeling it creep back in. I can only manage to make it to work. Supermarket less so and I have found myself to be skipping meals to avoid going out (being tight ass and not ordering in also)

I also got super sick on Christmas day and even though i was dying I just kept smoking because I was so depressed from missing seeing people who were in town for the one week a year due to being so sick. I ended up being sick for three weeks because obviously charging huge bongs doesn't help when you have an infection. 

I just feel sad about not being my full potential. I need to get my shit together. I finally have a good job (and my old shitty job where they drug test but it pays really well) if I actually quit I would save so much money. 

Last year I quit weed and cigs simultaneously but put on 25kg. This time I'm definitely quitting the weed but I think I might tackle the cigs in a month or so. I'm going to be mindful and not attempt to replace one with the other. I only smoke tobacco because I mix my weed so the oral fixation of Actually smoking cigarettes isn't very strong at the moment. 

Next weekend I'm going scuba diving with a colleague and I promised I would drive. This has been my motivation. 

Also. Money. My oral health. And general mood and energy. These are also big things. But if I was sober like I was at the start of last year I wouldn't have anxiety about driving to the beach or somewhere more fun rather than just basic travel because of fear. I'm an adventurous person and who I am now doesn't reflect that.

Thankyou for reading if you've gotten this far. I'm crying because I know I need help but I'm just so ashamed. I can't do this anymore and I deserve a happier life. I know it exists because I was there last year.... I just need to get through these first three days.

I've smoked weed everyday nonstop, for a little over ten years and have reached the point of seeing how much of a detriment it actually is. From spending so much money on this habit to realizing I'm no longer participating in hobbies or interests I used to love- I made the decision yesterday to quit. I suffer from chronic pain and stomach problems, which is the main reason I started smoking, but I am not one to just smoke one j or blunt, I will sit there and smoke joint after joint after blunt and so on until I'm in a sleepy stupor and pass out on the bed. It's not really beneficial as much anymore. And I've noticed that it doesn't really even  help with my pain as much, just gives me enough of an appetite to eat for the day. My question is, does anyone that have experience with pain of any sort- have you been able to use any exercises or mental tricks/meditations \*anything\* that could be implemented to handle stomach pain/body aches? I'm on day two of quitting and I love the mental clarity, the conversations I've been able to have, the productivity! It's great.

I bought the weed. I had it in my hands and was about to pick it apart and load it into a piece, when I hesitated and thought about it. 

I knew that I would regret it. I knew that it would be a mediocre experience being high, and I'd end up doing nothing for the rest of the day and just feel bad, and then have to continue going through the symptoms of withdrawal. So I shared how I was feeling with my old roomie, She wasn't ""on my side"" with my thought process, more neutral, but I ultimately was like, ""yeah, I can't do this. Take the weed back; I don't want it.""

I‚Äôm 19 y/o kid from Iceland and I‚Äôve been smoking daily for about two years now, though I started dabbling with it at 14. Usually I smoke about 2 joints a day but they‚Äôre very small, I only smoke about half a gram a day. It helps me sleep, I‚Äôve been dealing with sleeping problems literally since I was born and this is the only thing that can put me to sleep almost right away. I also do it because it feels nice, it‚Äôs fun, calms my anxiety (I‚Äôm an high functioning autistic too), and it has become a comforting familiarity.
But for the past few months I‚Äôve started to notice how my mind is almost always foggy, I forget words and my speech can be a bit slurred. Foe example, I used to write a LOT, but now I don‚Äôt even have the ability to come up with a pretty paragraph into my chapter. It‚Äôs all just a mess honestly. 
No one knows that I smoke except my boyfriend (who I smoke with) and my friends. My mom knows I do it ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù. 
But it has become such a habit, and I don‚Äôt know where to turn to to get help. I can‚Äôt go to rehab, and I‚Äôm in a program where they basically help me get back up on my feet (I was severely depressed for a few years). I dropped out of school, I have a difficult time finding and keeping a job because like I said I‚Äôm autistic. I also have a history of both childhood and teenage trauma and that program has helped me out a lot. I get a good sum of money from there every month and the person with my ‚Äúcase‚Äù has been extremely supportive and kind to me. I go there 3-4 times a week. 
But they can‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm smoking or it all goes to hell. 
I can‚Äôt go to rehab because then everyone will know and I think it‚Äôs a bit excessive. 
I‚Äôm so nervous about quitting because even when I try to skip one day, I can‚Äôt sleep at all and I get extremely short fused. (Which I kinda am already). But the withdrawals can last up to a month or even longer I‚Äôve heard. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm addicted or if it‚Äôs just a habit?

I feel like I‚Äôm hitting a wall of the initial productivity that quitting spurred on after the crappy parts of it were done. I feel depressed as usual, but without such imminent feelings of despair and help/hopelessness. Never in my 10 years of addiction have a felt such an urge to quit and stay clean than now. My baseline functioning diminished too much and I knew there was no way I could keep on losing friendships and losing time.

The initial clarity that has come along with this has helped me understand better my goals and wants and needs; Though I still feel that my ability to get things done is at a standstill. I have to re learn, or learn for the first time truly productive adults tendencies and foster the groundwork for a happy productive life.

I won't get into the details but basically I advised someone to take a substance they definitely shouldn't have and I knew was really strong.

He hit the dirt headfirst rolled into a puddle facedown started seizing and died for 10 minutes before the paramedics came and revived him. He was left in a coma for months only to awaken with severe dysfunctional short term memory. He can basically only remember things for 30 seconds or longer, a personal mental hell.

I've often revisited that day in my mind wondering what I could have done better. Imagining the pain of his parents knowing their son would never grow to be the man they wanted him to be. That they would have to dress bathe and take care of him for the rest of their lives. It's a guilt that weighed heavy on my mind for years.

 Well I quit smoking weed on the new years after a 7 year daily habit.  I've had a lot of really vivid dreams since I quit. But the most important one was one I had two nights ago. In this dream I went to visit this guy in the hospital(we will call him Tommy) I blacked out in my dream when I visited Tommy overwhelmed with my guilt when confronted with the consequences of my actions.

In my dream they forgave me told me everything happens for a reason that they held no Ill will and that I need to let it go and forgive myself. 

When I woke up I felt more at peace with myself than I did in a long time. I'm not asking for sympathy here. I'm trying to tell anyone out there who is struggling to quit that maybe you've been holding something back. Maybe the reason you keep smoking and find it hard to quit is that you have a serious weight on your mind that you keep distracting yourself from. And just maybe you need to stop getting high to really see what you need to do for yourself. Who knows what people have been covering up everyday with their weed habits. What shitty but freeing realizations you will have when you quit. Don't hold yourself back you deserve better.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48206326}"

I didn‚Äôt think I would be able to make it this far and I am going to keep on going because it‚Äôs become easy. The first two weeks it was hard saying no when my friends were smoking near me and I even came close to taking a rip with the lighter in my hand and a bong to my lips. In a phase of panic I passed it to my girlfriend and didn‚Äôt break and I am so thankful. I began having dreams about breaking my sobriety but they stopped when I made a pledge to myself that I would definitely stop no matter how much I felt tempted. When offered its easier to say no before the temptation kicks in even if you don‚Äôt want to say no, but it makes the decision stick better and it‚Äôs easier to not smoke.
I feel like a changed person. I don‚Äôt have any weird chest pains anymore, my daily anxiety evaporated. I now read at night instead of smoking or watch a good tv show. My social anxiety is non existent now and I feel way more confident. I wake up in the morning no longer in a daze of confusion and can hop right out of bed instead of being on my phone for an hour.

had my last toke thursday evening, when i realized that i had been in an hypomanic state for the past 10 days-- and that whenever i hit my pen, i'd get into very rapidly changing emotions, paranoia, light hallucinations, thoughts too fast to stay on top of, grandiosity, extreme irritability. then i compared those to my previous bad experiences with weed and with other drugs. it all came down on me in the course of a few seconds, and then i knew that i had to quit.

the past 2 nights have been full of vivid dreams, though i'm not at all unfamiliar with the effect. other than that, i feel so much better compared to the times where i was forced to get off weed and my previous quitting attempts, possibly because i truly made the conscious choice this time and got properly scared straight.

my thoughts and emotions are so much clearer, i don't have to blow things off as often, i suck less at listening or relating to people, and i forget my point mid-sentence less often. i'm really glad so far to have stopped, and even though i feel the pangs of addiction, i acknowledge now that it's a band aid and after years of abuse, that i cannot manage moderate use AT ALL, on top of the myriad of negative cognitive effects that weed brings along with it (which is very important for me as i have a cerebral career). i want to thank you all for having shared your experiences and for having helped me reach these hard truths that i've embraced now, which has made me think and feel about quitting much more comfortably than ever before. thanks for reading.",9,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6689857}"

I have averaged 100mg of edibles every single day. After 1.5 years, I got very sick. I thought it was just a stomach bug. I took a few days off and when I took my next edible dose, I woke of violently sick again. I quit for a little while but went back to it. After another 6 months I got incredibly sick again. I ended up in the ER. None of the anti nausea IV meds they gave me worked. The doctors were puzzled because nothing seemed to make the nausea go away. I was violently puking every 10 minutes for 24 hours. After the most recent episode, my primary care suggested I could have CHS. It made sense because before I started taking THC I was never sick to my stomach. I‚Äôm in my 30s and never touched weed in high school. I just got into it a few years ago to reduce anxiety. My doctor said that the major clue was that none of the anti nausea meds worked. Laying in bed sweating and with the chills, rolling around because the pain was so bad, and puking until I had nothing left and then puking some more was the only thing that I could do. Because if this, I am quitting for good. It‚Äôs been 9 days and I‚Äôm starting to feel normal again. I cut up my med card, tossed all my edibles, and decided that was it. Being that sick is not worth it. I‚Äôm almost glad that I have CHS because it gives me a reason to quit more so than just I need to be clean. I‚Äôve saved $100+ a week, plus a weekly trip to a dispensary. I have tried to stop a few times before but only made it a day or so. Now that I know, if I use THC I will be violently ill, it‚Äôs a lot easier. It‚Äôs a minimum 24 hours of misery, followed by a week of feeling drained and dehydrated before I feel back to normal. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really miss it. That warm hug feeling when an edible kicks in, I miss it so much. However, my health is more important and I will beat this.

Incase someone who are in a similar situation sees this I want to start by saying that it WILL get better and you WILL get over this!


Ive been smoking more or less daily for the last 2 years, mainly a little when I get home from work. I liked it because it surpresed my anxiety and I could just have fun by myself and watch TV and forget about everything else.
2 weeks ago I smoked way too much, I felt strong deassociation, didnt think my hands and legs were mine which freaked my out. Luckely I managed to get over the high fairly quickly. I felt some deassociation the days after but it felt fine after a couple of days. I then thought that I should take a break from weed and I didnt smoke for the following 6 days. I had some problem with sleep these days as many do when quiting weed as Im sure most of you have experienced.


A friend of mine then texted me asking if I wanted to smoke, I didnt really want to because of my break and what happened last time but I accepted anyway because we dont hang out that much.
it went fine at first but then I started to get crazy anaxity. About 3-4 hours after and my friend had left I still felt extremely anxious and close to panic. I wasnt even high anymore, I knew it was now just in my head, but I couldnt stop, I was in a constate state of close to panic, I was shaking!


I ended up going to my parents place 15 min away at 2 at night in a state of extreme anxiety, I tried to call them but they didn't pick up. I live in Sweden were weed is strictly illigal and frowned upon by older generations but I told them everything anyway (2 days later). The following 3-4 days was hell! I felt extreme anxiety about everything and the most siliest things one couldnt even believe would trigger anxiety. I knew it was just in my head but it never stopped, it feelt like the balance in my brain was off. To put things in to perspective, I remeber seeing a pen on the edge of a table and 1/5th of the pen was outide the table. Now I dont see or know why I almost got a panic attack because of it, but at the time I almost did. If about 3 of these things happened at the same time I started to feel panic and got a white stale color on my face.
I ended up taking sick leave from work and stayed at my parents place for a week. I have been living alone at my own place for 8 years.


I was shaking at times for the first 3-4 days when it got to much. Even when my dad was hugging me for support I could not stop shaking! I'm 26, how can this be!? I couldnt sleep. Whenever it got too much it felt like I was almost just brifly passing out even tho I did not.
I told myself that when I get passed this I will quit. All the houndred times ive smoked and enjoyed it doesent make up for this, and then there is the cost aspect and the fines I will get if caught which will prevent be to drive a car or get jobs here in Sweden.


I honestly didnt think this would or could happen to me. My best guess is that it was the lack of sleep and going in to it feeling I didnt want to smoke. I also have some social anxiety issues which probably dont help..
Anyway I just wanted to share my story and tell anyone else that it will get better. Now after one week I feel 90% back to normal, but still a little fragile.


I wish you all the best out there! Please take care of yourselves and be safe.

Never in this lifetime have I thought I had the willpower or drive to quit smoking pot. I gave up drinking about five months ago and the weed use increased exponentially. I've been smoking for twenty years. Fifteen of those years are as a very heavy user. Multiple times daily. I think I was finally fed up with feeling tired and half assed. 

A couple weeks ago I started school to become a certified EMT and I knew that I could not physically, mentally or morally continue down the path I was on. I want to be the most clear headed, helpful and knowledgeable EMT I could be and weed fit nowhere into that picture. 

The first few days were rough as could be. Little sleep, no appetite, irritability, sweats, the whole nine yards. After a few days the withdrawals started to calm a bit and I would experience moments of strain as opposed to entire days. Here I sit on Sunday morning, sipping coffee, listening to Chopin and studying for a quiz; the best part is: My head is completely clear and I LOVE IT!!! 

Never think that this plant is stronger than you. Inside you lies the key to unlock the strength you need to defeat this addiction. It doesn't mean everyday will be filled with bliss. In fact, some things will become harder without our weed crutch. But just know that you will be developing healthy mechanisms for coping with all of life's stresses. I'm so thankful for the community and the beautifully supportive people that inhabit it. If anyone ever needs to talk, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message. We're all in this together.

I am 12.5 weeks pregnant and so excited to have our baby join us in August. I obviously want the absolute best for this little babe and I know smoking while pregnant is NOT it. I was a heavy cigarette smoker as well. Have been smoking for over 10 years. 

My first inkling to that I was pregnant was the fact that I started getting incredibly dizzy everytime I had a cigarette. I finally took a test and lo and behold, I was pregnant! I stopped smoking cigarettes that day and battled the occasional craving with a nicorette inhaler (in hindsight maybe not the best idea...). I finally said NO MORE to the inhaler a few days ago after realizing that I was becoming addicted to that which absolutely defeats the purpose and is not helping me in any way. 

I had terrible morning sickness for the majority of my first trimester. I allowed myself 0.5 grams a day to get me through that. I ultimately quit that completely 2 weeks ago. 

My cravings for weed are getting less and less most days... but some days it is SO hard. My husband is recovering from a broken back and uses weed as a painkiller, which I completely understand and am okay with. I just ask him not to use it around me or make it obvious when he is going to smoke. He has done this well. 

Today I find myself craving cigarettes (as I am no longer using that nicorette inhaler, which I realize now, kept me addicted longer). I also find myself craving weed. 

I'm just having a hard time today... oh yeah and I am also almost completely weaned off of my antidepressants/anxiety meds which is of course hard as well.

I've been reading this sub, and I feel like this is the place. I messed my life up pretty bad and I want to put it back together but I'm too scared to face my problems. I know that weed addiction is what led me to this point. 

I've been smoking heavily and daily for 9 years, I'm 27 now. I struggled with uni because of weed, and every semester I would tell myself that it would be different this time but I just never seemed to learn. I ended up having to switch majors to computer science, and again I kept my weed smoking rituals untouched! I would wake and bake every day, skip classes to smoke, and if I ever was in class I was high.

My mind was as haziest as it can be at that point and I clearly did not make smart decisions. I hated my new major(this had nothing to do with weed) , but I hated myself even more everyday for putting myself there, I couldn't really make friends since I was missing so many classes, and I'm actually a very social guy and I e joy talking to people a lot. So I stopped going to classes knowing that I would get kicked out at some point. Which did happen eventually.

This is where I royaly fucked up though, I've been here on a student visa, and I was only allowed to switch majors once, but I was smoking so much that I thought, I would just marry my girlfriend and all my problems are solved. I did not lie to her about anything that was happening and was open about everything, and she said she didn't feel comfortable with it but that she'd still do it, but I was too high to even consider what she meant  I was being selfish and hoping to solve my problems. And I have to admit there were times where we would fight, and in the back of my mind i feel like I made it work because she was my only hope to not have to go back home. But I am grateful for the little bit of conscious I have left, that made me let that idea go and accept what I have coming to me. 

Last few months of 2019 were by far the worst. I would just smoke all the time, and aimlessly look online for anything that I can do to keep me sain and my overly exhausted guardian angel came through again and a hifi store opened in my city, and I love speakers, it was perfect! I got a job there and it was a great company that took care of its employees and I was learning a lot there too. 

I Knew it was temporary because I was expecting to have to leave in a few months. But then, come 2020 and  covid strikes, and due to the lockdown, I got a year's extension on my visa, and I was able to keep working there. In a weird way, the pandemic worked out in my favor! 

And after all if that, I still got stoned everyday through 2020 and I tried to stop a bunch of times, because there are many things I need to change about my life but im too scared. I still want go back to school and major in what I want,  and I need to tell my family what's happening, but that's a story for a different day. 

I just tossed out my weed equipment and I feel good about myself this time. Here we go... Day 1 again",12,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7120608}"

Natural and better highs that come from delayed gratification and working hard at bettering yourself. Weed happy will always be the same, never bad, never great. Just the same boring high all the time. When you let weed consume you, you miss out on all the great feelings out there that were created for you to experience. It's like going to a theme park everyday and just riding 1 ride for years. Sure it's fun, but after awhile it's no longer special. You want to experience more but you know weed will never give that to you. Don't you want to feel alive again? I definitely do. Get out of the clouds and ground yourself.

I haven‚Äôt smoked weed in 34 days. 

I‚Äôve had 3 opportunities to smoke in the last 34 days and have chosen not to smoke without thinking twice. I want to but I don‚Äôt wanna be at day 0 again. Im not ready to start over. Maybe I will be one da but I‚Äôm trying to stay sober til like May, when the weather gets nice I wouldn‚Äôt mind enjoying a joint outside as I grill or open my pool, go to the park or something. This all just begs the thought that if I can make it to like 150 days why would I start over?  I‚Äôve got to get to a better mental state before I pick it up again. All I know so pointless to even be saying this but I still have to get it out. 

I feel like I‚Äôve intentionally created distance between myself and my friends just for no reason whatsoever other than I just feel like I want to be left alone or I just have nothing to say. They‚Äôve done nothing wrong this is just all me. My wife and my son have really become my priority and they‚Äôre an inspiration to stay strong so it almost feels like I don‚Äôt even need friendship anymore. But I have good friends. I dunno. 

What has been the hardest has been headaches and anxiety. I‚Äôm not sure if the headaches are even weed related but when I was constantly getting stoned I did not experience this at all. I‚Äôm going to be getting a catscan soon just to be safe as I‚Äôve felt weird cracking or popping in my head, might be a muscle or tendon I have no clue but it didn‚Äôt feel normal. This has really weighed on me. 

And the anxiety, like I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm fully present in reality and kinda just feel disconnected from the world. I kinda had a mini panic attack the other day and just felt like I didn‚Äôt wanna be alive anymore and everything felt so ‚Äúfar away‚Äù for some reason. Like I was looking at my phone and it‚Äôs only maybe a foot away from my face but it just felt far away or the way I was perceiving it or seeing it seemed as though it was further from my eyes than it really was. I‚Äôve almost felt delusional or just on auto pilot. Like I‚Äôm just skating through the moments and even though I‚Äôm alive it feels like I‚Äôm not actually living. I‚Äôm a teacher and work has been incredibly stressful without coming home and hitting a bowl and just kinda not even worrying about all the lesson planning I have to do. But now that I don‚Äôt have an escape that stress is just hitting me like a ton of bricks. Old feelings from my childhood have come into my mind more so in the last week than they have in 13 years of smoking. 

My outlet has always been weed + video games as it‚Äôs easy to get lost in an open world game or an RPG and just forget all my problems. I still game in my down time but without weed I wonder what I‚Äôm even doing in my 30‚Äôs just gaming at night. I plan to start running when the weather gets warmer and really focusing on my body while staying sober.

It almost feels like the flu, I go from being sweaty to being cold, I'm nauseas often because I have to relearn how to eat not stoned, my head hurts periodically, and my energy levels/head space fluctuate from eh to low.   
With that said! I have learned a few things.   
Keeping busy is key, whether its playing a video game, learning a new subject, taking a walk, or whatever else, staying busy occupies the mind and time.   
Stretch and get some exercise, it helps relieve tension in the body and helps with sleep.  
And most importantly, drink a shit ton of water. When your body is overly hydrated you will start to crave sodium to help regulate the water thus making you hungry-- I've been eating dried plantains like they are going out of style.    
On a final note, stay positive friends. Even though its hard and it feels like you are having to 'give up' something that made you feel good, its worth it. Whenever you have a craving, pause and analyze the craving, deduce why you want to consume cannabis and if necessary, make a pro/con list, I guarantee you the cons will outweigh the pros.

It encouraged me to stay on track even though I had a lot of bad moments over the period of these weeks.

&#x200B;

I¬¥m 29 years old and I¬¥m in the last semester of my college (becoming a teacher).

As a sidenote, English isn¬¥t my first language and I¬¥m sorry if you might have trouble to understand bits of my story.

&#x200B;

I quit cold turkey \[nicotine and weed\] after smoking 8 years. I never was an intense smoker, but eventually I started to smoke on a daily basis for the last two years. Since 2020, I didn¬¥t really smoke to get high, but rather as a lifestyle. I did a lot of calisthenics and gymnastics, which was maybe a way to compensate my other deficits in life. Since I had a trapeze strain nine months ago, I still continued to exercise six times a week and my injury only worsened. Somehow, my weed addiction helped me to overcome my soreness and desire to rest and I never really listened to my body ( I have an addictive personality). In December 2020, I was forced to stop and my depression started to come up. Since I already lost my drivers license three years ago because I drove a car one day after smoking, a lot of regrets also came up and I had physiological and psychological issues to cope with. Moreover, I didn¬¥t talk to my parents over a period of 3 years since my mother had an alcohol addiction and my father wanted to save the family despite creating more toxicity than healing. I isolated more and more and I felt uncorfortable as nobody was able to comprehend my struggles. I¬¥m currently unhappy with my life and I compare a lot with other people as I¬¥m ""frozen"" in my last semester and somehow I¬¥m not able to finish it off since I was always scared of new stages of life. Most of my friends finished college, which is the reason why I¬¥m feeling under pressure.

The Corona situation also worsened my circumstances and I¬¥m going to lose my part-time job contract in March. My existence depends on this job and due to the personal withdrawal struggles I am somehow not able to apply for new jobs. I¬¥m often lieing in bed until 2pm and I isolate myself often in my room because the sweating and insomnia is taking all my energy. I also have to finish my thesis papers for university and unfortunately I am too busy with mental health. I already accepted the fact that I¬¥m going to need one semester more but this realization also takes a huge toll on my mental health.

Since December, I also met a girl, who helped me a lot during this time and she was one of the reasons why I quit smoking weed and cigarettes in the first place. Everything was well and we considered to enter into a relationship until she texted me two weeks ago that she had something important to tell me. She had a crush on another guy last year in September and he rejected her. One day before her message, he texted her again and told her that he would like to spend more time with her again. Shortly after, she left me and completely cut the contact despite knowing that I wasn¬¥t in the best state. It was totally unexpected. We even spent time the night before and after this incident my self esteem was totally crushed.

&#x200B;

Somehow, the new year started pretty shitty for me.

\-going to lose my job due corona

\-unable to exercise

\-no drivers license

\-one semester extented due to corona

\-lost the girl I really liked to another random guy who dumped her previously

\-emotional breakdowns and crying a lot

\-feeling like a burden to my friends and my family

\-often feeling lonely

\-intense night sweats

\-bad sleep

After I received the message, I rolled a blunt and I think i circled two hours in my room and cried on the floor before I threw everything away and resisted the urge to smoke. I think I wouldn¬¥t be where I am now if I would have smoked this blunt 17 days ago.  During this time, I was also diagnosed with a depressive phase and received some antidepressants, which I never took as I want to overcome the emotional struggle on my own.

As a reminder for myself, I wanted to sum up some positive facts which encourage me to stay on track. These positive aspects are helping me to remember why I quit both at the same time. By visiting this subreddit (A LOT) I also know that things are going to be better again and all your stories help me to avoid a relapse.

Positive things after 23 days of abstinence:

\-black phlegm cough heavilly reduced and hopefully going away eventually

\-able to feel emotions more intense (even being happy receiving sun rays on the skin)

\-being grateful for the support from my family and my ""real"" friends (a lot of people who I assumed to be my friends somehow ""disappeared"" from my life)

\-saving money (spent 200-300‚Ç¨ each month for weed during 2020)

\-I am able to be happy again although I¬¥m still very emotional sometimes

\-I know I¬¥ll be able to get my drivers license again after my body becomes ""detoxed""

\- No desire to smoke cigarettes or joints

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, the negative parts still outweigh the positive ones. Still, after reading a lot of your stories I know things will get better and I¬¥ll be strong enough to overcome my conflicts.

I have been smoking weed every day for like 3 years now and so far I have never in my life smoked a joint without tobacco (usually I put in 0,3 grams of weed together with 1 cigarette). Usually I really feel like I am having a hard time not to smoke joints. And I always crave the smoking and not necessarily the high, when I smoke I already look forward to the next joint.

Btw I never smoke cigarettes.

but my question is then could it be that I just have a nicotine addiction and not a weed addiction? 

I wish I could smoke joints in moderation, just like 1 pure joint every month or so, is there any chance of succeeding this practice? And does smoking pure weed decrease addiction?

Please share me your insights since I often do not see any threads about the influence of adding tobacco in your joints on this forum! Thank you üôèüèº

I‚Äôve been lurking on here mainly just trying to keep everything buried deep inside me hoping it‚Äôll all go away but I just can‚Äôt. I used to be an okay decent person before I started Mary j... I only started because my best friend got me into it and well, might I just add she was my only friend. I not only started growing a stronger bond with her because of it but I actually developed a craving for it and by 16 I was hooked. I smoked carts and opted to stick to that bc of how convenient and discreet it always was until recently where I‚Äôve discovered history usually repeats itself and 50 years ago people didn‚Äôt know sh*t about how cigarettes are super toxic for your health but now there‚Äôs a pile of dead bodies out there bc of that. Idk why we humans insist on always running towards the very things that we‚Äôre supposed to run away from. Anything we‚Äôre told not to do spikes our curiosity and inner rebelliousness. This is how I got to where I am because I wanted to prove people wrong. And I cared more about looking cool/ numbing my feelings than I did about respecting my body & understanding none of this stuff was good for me. I challenge everything and I still do but now life is starting to get really challenging for me. Most importantly, my anxiety and depression have never been so off the roof. I can‚Äôt sleep some nights and i can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs because of the weed or because of me. I am not the same person I used to be when I was in my early teens, I‚Äôm about to turn 19 soon and it just feels like I‚Äôve lived on this planet for 30 already.

UGH I don‚Äôt want to quit, I only want to use it occasionally but I would still be considered an addict, right? F*ck idk anymore. Just hoping that 5 years from now, I‚Äôve got my sh*t together because one thing I‚Äôve noticed is that for so many reasons, I‚Äôve lost my will to live. I‚Äôm not trying to get all emo I just need to speak my mind. And this i can claim full responsibility for. My life is my responsibility. The choices I made, I hold myself 100% accountable for. It‚Äôs just that these days when I‚Äôm not high, all I think about are my problems (to the point where I can‚Äôt sleep) and when I do get high, I almost forget them completely. But my main point is, once that rush is gone I fkn hate my life so much I wish I could just sleep and never wake up again. F*ck didn‚Äôt mean to go all emo I just can‚Äôt handle the past, I can‚Äôt handle the fact that I once used to be someone I can barely recognize now and it‚Äôs hitting really hard because I‚Äôm not proud of who I used to be but I have to face the consequences for the mistakes that person made. I look in the mirror and I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm stuck in this mental prison where nothing ever changes. Sometimes I might have good days, sometimes bad but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm always STUCK.

I still haven‚Äôt got myself to quit yet. Specifically, over the past couple years I‚Äôve been smoking weed to escape my loneliness more than ever. There were many Friday nights were I‚Äôd have FOMO but then I‚Äôd smoke weed alone and everything would be alright. I‚Äôd tell myself I didn‚Äôt need friends and being alone wouldn‚Äôt be too bad. I wasn‚Äôt always the most social but I would still try and make friendships last. 

But my weed habit changed my perspective. And while this was fun for a while, I was just creating a bigger problem with my loneliness. By isolating myself more I started losing touch with old friends. Eventually it got to a point where I had no friends left, leading to this vicious cycle of medicating to feel better. I sometimes lose hope because i just don‚Äôt seem interested in talking to people sometimes.

Where as before I wasn‚Äôt actually lonely, I just wasn‚Äôt keeping in touch, now it seems like I am alone. It seems like my relationships have mostly faded away and the whole time I didn‚Äôt even realize it because I was always getting high. It wasn‚Äôt just the weed tho, I had always been introverted, but the weed is what made me become antisocial and not care as much. Also the friends I had when I was smoking weren‚Äôt really there for me after all.

Now it‚Äôs at a point where I want to tell myself that I‚Äôll make friends when I quit. But I worry that if I don‚Äôt then I‚Äôll just fall back into old patterns. I‚Äôm in my twenties so I‚Äôm starting to get the feeling that there are less and less connections to make for friends in the real world. Everyone else seems to have their groups already picked out so I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd fit in. Being a stoner also makes me feel like an outcast to certain people who don‚Äôt use it.

I feel like I‚Äôm too satisfied getting high alone, so I fear that it just may never quit and that scares me, since I don‚Äôt want to go through life buzzed and with no control. I also worry because I feel like if I don‚Äôt ever quit weed then I won‚Äôt have enough motivation to make new friends. I‚Äôll be too high in my comfort zone.

I just made a post yesterday talking about how my withdrawals have subsided quite a bit, but there is one withdrawal symptom that I‚Äôm still struggling with. It happens when I take naps but also at night. I get a lot of false awakening dreams, sometimes layered (inception style), where I will ‚Äúwake up‚Äù in my dream but be physically paralyzed and unable to actually open my eyes or move. Then I will ‚Äúfall back asleep‚Äù and continue dreaming about waking up and then falling back asleep and it keeps repeating itself. The dreams are so vivid and feel so real that I actually do think I‚Äôm waking up and unable to move. It‚Äôs honestly kind of distressing and when I actually do wake up I feel totally disoriented. It‚Äôs a pretty messed up symptom that can probably only be explained by months/years of chronic marijuana abuse. Has anyone had this or something similar happen to them? I know that I can get through this with time and healthy living (which hasn‚Äôt been the easiest), but sharing my experiences here and talking to others help me get through.

Everyday when i would get home i would shower and then smoke all night. on weekends, it would be from waking up to going to sleep. i would even get high before doing my at home workouts.. i used it as my escape from boredom or to just be high.. because why not. it turned into everyday. i would constantly tell myself its okay to smoke everyday and live like this because as long as i'm making my income and paying all my bills and credit cards on time, i'm a responsible adult and i'm okay. then i found out my sister in laws best friend sells.. so it became an every two weeks buying a quarter and smoking it all. then buying again... till i smoked it all and kept going back. i felt empty honestly. my 5 year old nephew would sleepover and id be going to the bathroom to hit my cartridge. anything and everything id do i would need to justify with smoking a little before i did it. even to do the dishes i'm like, let me hit the bong. its crazy how it has become my habit. i just started feeling guilty for being like this. after reading this reddit and people's experience it really opened my eyes that i'm not the only one addicted to marijuana. it has completely changed me. i use to always go to the gym and cared about what i ate. i have developed so much anxiety and fear of finding a path for me, such as a good career. i was in the process of starting a photography business but i was so insecure about my work because marijuana gave me that anxiety about thinking of what others in my city would think of me.

2. I literally burned insense sticks on two occasions and pretended to smoke it by, holding it in my hand because I miss the action of smoking

I had the ability to smoke, I had the desire, but my will has finally triumphed. I had only been able to be sober for about 6 months when I was 17 for probation, and then again for a month in rehab. Both times, were due to external factors. 

I cannot take credit fully. I must give credit to a source of strength which I have never known how to draw on until now. I have always been a hardcore atheist, very cynical, logical, rational. I prided myself on these intellectual qualities. I struggled while in rehab because of my unwillingness to admit the existence of a higher power. 

The real difference between this time and others was that I reached out to my higher power and acknowledged the deeper part of my being. I asked the oneness, the consciousness, the Universe, God, whatever it‚Äôs called, to please help me get through this night. I begged for help and I got it. 

I don‚Äôt know how or why it took so long, but god dammit I‚Äôm here now. And I‚Äôm not fucking leaving.

TL:DR- Made it through my first 24 hours independently without being in a rehab facility or under supervision.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45084706}"

Everything I have been learning is if we want it to stick we have to change our dialogue to the positive. We never have to smoke again.  We are happy to live a life weed free. We need to debunk the myths associated with weed and get to a place where we realize we derive no pleasure from smoking.  That is how we can truly enjoy our sober life instead of just white knuckling and feeling like you are pushing thru it.  Sure we are missing out on some things.
 we are missing out on:

-having a smokers cough.  
-Smoking resin and garbage weed/ash when we can't score
-Harassing our friends or dealers to try and find some weed
-Only calling certain people to ask them for weed and pretending like we care about their day or that we will hangout in the future but dipping as soon as we get our weed
-Social anxiety and isolation
-Feeling like we are dumb/cant keep up with conversations
-Binge eating resulting in weight gain and sugar hangovers
-Decreased lung capacity weezing when walking up a simple flight of stairs
-Paranoia of going out in public and smelling like weed
-Not being able to look people in the eye being ashamed of them knowing we are high
-Lack of motivation to create or do your hobbies
-A messy house and dirty dishes
-Settling for less
-A frumpy look/style cause you hardly have the motivation to shower let alone groom yourself and put on anything other than sweat pants
-Sitting on the couch versus hitting the gym

The list goes on...

Those still smoking really think critically about what you are gaining from it.  I know I thought it  gave me a positive outlook on life and gave me a great philosophical wise understanding of things.
  I thought it gave me great ideas and motivation.  Well once i started being honest with myself I realized my great high ideas were really obvious things. id actually try to say wise things and ive literally had my friends be like DUH... When i thought i was preaching the gospel or something.  I've said things like ""i like when its rolling cause then you dont have to light it""
  Also the motivation and positive outlook lasted for like 20 minutes then i got lazy, binged netflix, ordered greasy expensive delivery (cause I was too stoned to go out and deal with people.) felt bad then naturally smoked again to feel better. All great ideas and dreams no action.
  Wow this was long thanks for reading if you got this far. I'll be happy if just one person reads this and relates.  I recommend the book ""the joy of quitting cannabis"" by Chris Sullivan.

I‚Äôm the type that always puts things off, I‚Äôll always do it later. After nearly 20 years of daily use, I feel this immense weight that I have squandered a large chunk of my life.

She is a corporate attorney.

I have a lot of dreams and goals, mainly would like to start a business. My illegal dispensary was wildly successful, I crave running a successful business again.

Around day 16 I was feeling hopeless, miserable, and constantly tired (see second post). I started to think, maybe if some people can just smoke intermittently without developing addiction/dependency, maybe only some people can recover from chronic/habitual use. I thought I might never recover. I was wrong; it is day 31 for me and I am feeling good: 

- I wake up before 7am every day. I have *energy* in the morning. I have a morning routine which includes a nutritious breakfast for the first time in a long time (shout out to my smoothie post). I start my day instead of hitting snooze and walking around like a zombie all day.
- I just started my last semester of undergrad and for the first time I don't feel overwhelmed by the work. I'm staying on top of things, I can remember things from lecture/while studying, and I have the mental bandwidth to solve problems.
- I had to move away from my partner because I have in person classes this semester and he lives in a different city now. We've been together for ~4 years and living together for ~3. It was heart wrenching to not only leave him but to move back to the city where we met (in college) without him. BUT, I was able to feel and process and regulate my emotions and to grieve like a normal fucking person, self-soothe, and then pick myself up.
- I've been cooking and meal prepping and the food actually tastes good! I'm eating tasty, healthy, homemade food consistently for the first time.
- I started a new medication for my ADHD I start seeing a new therapist who specializes in ADHD on Monday.
- I can do simple things like go for a walk or watch a movie (and enjoy them!) without immediately thinking ""wait I should get high for this"" or wishing I was high. 
- I'm saving more money and, when I am spending, it is on things like groceries instead of weed and eating out. 
- I have a nightly routine that includes stretching for 15 minutes, a hot shower, and reading for 30 minutes and I have never slept so peacefully in my life (and the dreams are still fun and interesting lol).

When I quit, I told myself that I just needed to survive the first month and that would be enough. My life hasn't *drastically* improved, but I do think these small, positive changes add up to more than just surviving. If I feel this good after just 30 days of sobriety and without even actively trying to make any other positive changes, I can't help but wonder where I would be if I hadn't spent the last 7 years stoned. There's no point in dwelling on the past though. We can only look to the future. My goal is to add cold showers and exercise into my routine for the next 30 days. I read on here that it usually takes 5-10 attempts to quit for good. This is my 5th real, honest attempt and the longest I have ever made it. Let's hope this is the one. Onward!

EDIT: pls stop asking me about my ADHD medication lolz my post got modded - i didn't mean to imply that my new medication is a remedy for weed addiction/dependency. i just meant that i knew i needed a new medication, and quitting weed helped me have the energy to make that happen. just another positive step towards self care :-)",237,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5026111}"

I won‚Äôt bore with details but I have quit as of 6 days ago. Whilst I know this is a short time, the anxiety and emotional distress I am experiencing since quitting have made it more evident that this is an addiction.

Weed has been affecting all aspects of my life and I am starting to hate myself for the way I have been living.

When my partner and I initially discussed my desire to confront this addiction, he wanted to keep smoking weed away from the house and I said this was fine. I felt it was MY problem and I felt I shouldn‚Äôt be controlling anyone else. 

My problem now is that;
1. I become irritable and jealous knowing he is still enjoying getting high (my own problem I know), and
2. I know this will make it less likely I will succeed in freeing myself of this addiction. I can simply ask him to bring a little weed home with him, and it is more likely I will do so when I am experiencing anxiety from withdrawals.

The point is I don‚Äôt think it is healthy for me to be in this environment. I explained calmly that I just cannot be in a relationship with a weed smoker. He is now furious, saying I am controlling and giving him ultimatums, and that ‚Äòhe isn‚Äôt addicted he just likes smoking on weekends‚Äô. 

Is this not an ok thing to ask of a partner? He used the example of breaking up with someone because they smoke cigarettes to illustrate how how ridiculous my request was.

Situation - Today I actually thought about smoking again. I mean these thoughts pop up from now and then, but today I ACTUALLY thought about smoking.

I actually literally went outside and was about to look. 

The urge hasn't totally passed but it is important for me to write about this somewhere and share what is going on.

I would smoke even when my true self didn't want to and in return I felt apathy and hopelessness in my life. It got to the point where every day I would wake up out of control, blazing till nightfall. When night arrived I would take my bud and chuck it as far as possible. only to wake in the morning and either by more or scavenge around to find the remains. Today I have been sober for 7m and 14d and I am not going to throw it all away.

Was real clever about the budget, probably spent $500 on the box and everything in it. Another $200 on monitors.  I've been learning web development for the last 6 months and it was about time for a serious upgrade to my old system. 

Anyways, I was talking with my mom about addiction today (she's about 2 months sober from alcohol).  And I was talking about my tracker app and how it keeps track of how much money you save. I never really paid attention to it, but I was thinking ""I wonder if quitting has paid for my new PC?""

I checked the app just now, and yep, I've paid for it with room to spare. According to *Grounded,* I've saved \~$1000 over the last 8 months and 2 days. Probably more because I think I was very conservative with my estimate when I programmed the app. It's hard to admit to yourself how much you *really* spent on it. It's a bit embarrassing really but it was a time in my life that I accept. 

If I was still using marijuana I'd have nothing to show for it. That's the problem with addiction - you spend all this money, but you always end up with nothing to show for it. Nothing to talk about.  

But now, I have a great new PC that will last me years. A clear head that I can use to learn a challenging skill that I can take with my for years to come - Quitting marijuana didn't do those things for me, it only helped me get started. 

Something I heard on the show *The Wire* that I'm watching now said ""Getting clean is the easy part. Now comes life."" And that really stuck with me. I had gotten off the weed a handful of times, but always fell back. It was life that was tripping me up. But now I've got life in control. I'm doing the right things and working towards my goals. It's almost surreal.

Anyways, it's been a long journey. Yet it still feels so recent. It's bizarre. I hope you all are doing well too. I still like seeing the new posts come across my feed, it reminds me of how far I've come and it's humbling.

What would I have to deal with in quitting my best kept secret from the world? I was the only one who knew how addicted I was, how much I was chained to the feelings of getting high, and how engrained the traditions of marijuana had become in my life.
Looking back now it is the best decision I could have ever made. It was challenging at first, but what did I really have to lose? I was scared of who I might see in the mirror after the smoke cleared, because after all wasn‚Äôt weed helping me be me? 
Well, it turns out the smoke was indeed a farce, a mask that was keeping me from seeing and being the real me. It was suppressing my emotions, my light, my kindness to others closing the door on my openness and limiting my best qualities! It was suppressing the top qualities that I loved most about myself! My potential had drifted away like the many hits of smoke I exhaled over the years. 
In studying my past through a cloudless lens, I‚Äôve concluded the dependence that consumed me for so many years was far too limiting. 
I love myself too much to smoke again, the freedom of my heart, my mind, and my soul is simply too precious a gift for me to misspend.

I just scrolled through of some of today‚Äôs posts and they are incredibly moving. I started smoking daily at 15, and now approaching 21, I smoke from when I wake up until I fall asleep. 

I was encouraged to attempt at least one day without pot, and I was expecting these side effects (less than 200 calories all day, anxiety irritability, extreme boredom) but the realizations I‚Äôm coming to are quite powerful.

When stoned, I very, very rarely consider my how poor my own mental health is, but it couldn‚Äôt be clearer to me now. I like to tell myself that weed ‚Äúcures‚Äù my depression. But no, I get so fucking high that I‚Äôm too numb to feel.

Depression is why I started smoking, and while the leaves mask the depression, I‚Äôm sure the residual anxiety is something I will be dealing with for years to come. Does anyone have any tips on dealing with the boredom? I am not kidding, I spent 2.5 hours sitting in a chair looking at the wall. 

I am thankful to stumble across this community, as having a group of people to relate to is the most important part of recovery. I love each and every one of you, stay strong, stay safe üí™",20,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43492392}"

Ironically I‚Äôm 24 days clean (since 12/28) and unfortunately don‚Äôt have many positive results to show for it so far. 

My biggest concern/issue is my constant anxiety. It gives me a feeling of a tight chest and has a lingering dull pain. I‚Äôm almost positive this is just anxiety as I exercise frequently and am in shape, but it is overwhelming since it persists from the moment I wake up until I go to bed, with maybe 30 minutes of ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù throughout the day where I don‚Äôt feel this way (if I‚Äôm lucky). I also have terrible dreams and wake up anxious in the middle of the night every night. Whether it‚Äôs during the night or throughout the day, I also always notice myself holding my breath and not breathing normally. To add to this, I have been extremely depressed and haven‚Äôt felt happiness in a long time (years) even though I have a stable job, gf, and am pursuing my MBA. 

Since I exercise, read, walk my dog, spend time with others, and do outdoor activities but still feel this way, does anyone have any suggestions on how to overcome this psychological prison? I have an annual check up next week and will be requesting therapy, but I was wondering if anyone had any self-initiated remedies to deal with this or at least make things more tolerable. I was also thinking meditation since I have essentially zero control over my thoughts.

I had to quit because there was a bug problem at my house and weed was exacerbating my bug phobia and paranoia. I had wanted to quit before that but struggled. My sleep improved phenomenally and I started thinking clearly. No more bleh feeling. I started eating again, too.

I moved to a legal state. Started smoking again, immediately had issues with my sleep and weird abdominal stuff. So I've decided I'm quitting for good. Im on day 2 and I have a ridiculous stash in my house right now but I'm not interested in touching the stuff. Im to the point now where I'm thinking about the next day consequences of smoking before lighting up. 

About my mom, she's a heavy smoker and as long as I can remember has always smoked. In fact, my first joint I had found on the steps in our basement. It was hers. I became addicted as a teenager and used to steal from her stash all the time. 

All the weed I currently have she gave to me. I can see the negative effects so clearly now. She's always tired and she's kinda just never thinking long term. I love my mom and we have a very close relationship even though it's pretty dysfunctional. She's got mental health issues as well. 

I don't need her to quit so I can stay sober but its really hard knowing she smokes so much, seeing the effect it has on her, and knowing she's an enabler. I was going to give her back all this weed but decided I have enough self control to stay away from it. Im just turned off by the stuff now after seeing myself sober while seeing her high all the time. Plus all the other stuff. 

Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions on how to handle this whole thing? Some rules I can set for when we spend time together? Any wisdom for how to keep working on making our relationship less dysfunctional while she's still smoking so much? Anything that will bring peace of mind?

I am just writing this for some personal accountability. I've known for a long time, but recently it became very apparent, that I cannot moderate my consumption of cannabis. I thought doing well in grad school, showing up to work on time, and being in a stable relationship meant that I wasn't an addict and that there wasn't a problem, but I am and there is.

Today is Day 1 of my journey towards bettering myself and relearning to respect and appreciate the integrity of my own mind and body. Yesterday I had a moment of clarity and in a following moment of strength I ""accidently"" dropped the banger of my dab rig on the ground, breaking it. This ended a cycle of non-stop dabbing that had lasted since before the pandemic. I'm talking around half a gram of shatter/crumble a day from 6am till 10pm. This was only the most recent episode of a 5 year trend. But all of a sudden I feel freed. In a fervor of iconoclasticism I  smashed the object that preoccupied my concern, wallet, and health.

I will be posting to this sub every few days on this account to help keep myself focused. I hope and pray that all of you (and myself) out there who are suffering from addiction find the strength and compassion within ourselves to help ourselves. You are not alone. 

If anyone needs to talk, please do not hesitate to direct message me. Community is the surest way towards healing.

I've decided July that I was going to quit soon as I was getting sick and tired of smoking for the last 10 years and every time I had a 'break' I would crumble and go back to smoking and tried to convince myself that I would cut down on smoking so regularly and would smoke in the evenings after I have done everything. Although everything was literally nothing but just go the day without smoking and being unproductive and just think about when I could next smoke. I'm not going to pretend it was easy, the first few weeks was hell. Even now after 6 months of being sober I still have urges but you just need to ride it out and take everyday as it comes. Don't let yourself fall back into the old habits, it's not worth it. Even doing it once is not worth it I've realized as it just triggers old habits and bang you're back into square 1 and God knows how long you'll be in there until you get this same feeling.
What has helped me is just making an excuse to my smoker friends on why I couldn't smoke at first and then after that I just said yeah I don't smoke anymore. Have I lost connection with a lot of my smoker friends? Yes, I don't get invited out as much and honestly sometimes I get sad thinking about it and I dislike them for it but it's best they didn't to be honest. Even when I go see them and I decide to just chill with them and not smoke which I have done a few times, I realize what a sad habit smoking and chilling is and what a waste of time it has been. Seeing them high just gives me the I feel sorry for them feeling and I honestly dislike smoking more due to them being in a zombie like state.
I've reached out to old friends I used to hang around with that don't smoke and I've been surprised at how supportive some of them have been and accepted me without question. Of course I got the few that made the out of the drug cave are you? or the back from the dead comments here and there but for the most they've really enjoyed having me back so to say.
In the beginning you will have mood swings and you'll get really worked up about stuff when you put into context aren't really such a big deal but however due to your body's chemistry changing and your mind changing everything seemed to trigger me instantly and I would get furious over stuff I wouldn't have given a shit about if I weren't going through withdrawal stage.
All I can advise you is that there's so much to life rather than getting high and doing shit or just getting high by itself. Sure you could say food tastes great when high, sure music sounds better but if everything was better when high then why do you have that miserable feeling when you high and don't do shit? When you get high and feel like you're wasting so much more potential? I swear food for me tastes as great as it did whilst I was high, views are just as amazing now as they were when I used to smoke and music still hits the same for me. I just get to remember it and feel it more now and I've travelled twice during the pandemic whilst I didn't travel for 3 years because I was spending all my money on weed.
I can't give you a reason to quit, you've got to genuinely want to quit to quit. I'm not talking about you kind of want to quit, NO, YOU'VE GOT TO ACTUALLY WANT TO QUIT AND HAVE HATRED FOR THE WAY IT MAKES YOU FEEL AND HATE WEED TO QUIT. Well that's what I believe at least.

2021-01-21 12:57:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/l23qs4/difficulties_rationalizing_quitting/,Difficulties Rationalizing Quitting,"Throwaway of course.

Everybody learns differently. My learning tactic is to try to rationalize every decision to the point that is becomes a ""yes or no"" decision. Obviously, this is not always going to be the case as few things are black and white. But, it helps me think through decisions and come to conclusions.

Here is the sticky part. I am having a ton of trouble rationalizing quitting weed (weed meaning: weed, but occasionally keif/hash and edibles). I am on my third day of sobriety from weed and I am having trouble rationalizing why it is a good idea. I was hoping this community could help me pick apart my thought process or give insight into something I may not have considered. I will try to keep this as short as I can - so I will highlight why I think I could quit based on common advice I have seen, then say the counter argument as to why I am having trouble with that. Some of these are relatable I am sure. But, many other reasons are truly specific to a minority of people and this is where my trouble is.

Here we go folks - thank you for those who read this through as well. If it is too long, just read a few of the paragraphs that interest you.

**Cleanliness** \- Not for me... usually. I am a home-owner and my driveway is always shoveled, lawn kept tidy, dishes always done, etc. I worked in a bar for years so cleaning is organizing is almost something I enjoy. There are times I get tired and leave the mess for the next day, but I would say at least 90% of the time this is not the case when stoned.

**Saves** **Money** \- This one is obvious. But, the issue is that weed is fairly cheap and I consider myself high income (100K+ income). I can find it for generally around 6$ a gram CDN (around 5$US). Keif/hash is more, usually about 4X the cost. I spend around 1000 - 1500CDN (around 1000US) per year on weed and paraphernalia. My issue is I can rationalize the entertainment value. For a small amount of money, I can entertain myself for an entire Sunday. Or, pre-covid, I would actually save money due to drinking less. If I go to the bars with my friends I will almost always drink substantially less because I would go smoke a joint at some point in the night. Overall my finances are not a concern. I dont know what makes someone a ""1%er"", but I am sure I am close if not already in that category. I wont be forever, but for my prime earning years - very possibly.

**Memory** **Loss** \- This one I think I have succumbed to. I have been using an agenda for years now and I think it is partially due to marijuana and partially due to my work/life balance. I am a very busy guy and I need to use this agenda almost every day to make sure I get all work/personal errands done. If I do not write groceries in my agenda, I will probably forget to pick them up on my way home. But, this may be just be due to my mind being preoccupied with other things I need to get done.

**Fitness** \- No issues here. I workout 4 times a week + 1 cardio session. I do this every week without fail, unless I am having a recovery week and take it light or I am out of the country. Sometimes my workouts are not as intense as I wish, but overall I am a fit person. Could always be more, but everybody wants to be more fit (even if they are olympians) so I dont see it as an issue.

**Control** \- This is an issue. Weed crosses my mind multiple times a day. I know I am hooked because its fun and easy. I can control my urges if I want to though. If I get a craving, I know I just need to wait around 30 minutes and the urge usually subsides unless I am completely bored. Then I will go for a run or something else totally engaging to get my mind in a different place. But, my 30 minute trick usually works. I do have bad cravings the day after I smoke. Then it tapers off over the next few days/weeks. Every year I take a trip to a different country for around a month. I have no issues not smoking wherever I am. If I go to Amsterdam or something, I am sure I will smoke because come on. But, in general, my vacations are smoke free because I am too busy doing other things. Overall though, I am definitely addicted to weed, but I am also definitely able to just say no if it would put me in a high-risk situation or as a test to be master of my domain.

**Relationships** \- Pre-Covid, I would see my parents every Sunday. I have a small friend circle as well that I can count on to have fun with. I do wish sometimes I spent less time at work and made more time with my friends. But, I think this is a consequence of being in the industry that I am. I do have a girlfriend of 3 years and we are planning to move in together shortly - we havent yet because her spot is awesome, cheap, and downtown. I do wish sometimes I spent more time with her as well, but I think this is more due to my work/life balance rather than weed. She does not care if I smoke, but I think she would if it impacted areas of my life obviously negatively. Overall I think we do have a healthy relationship.

**My** **Lungs** \- This is my biggest point of quitting. I know weed is substantially better than cigarettes, but it cannot be good in any way. I considered vaping, but I really enjoy the few moments on my patio smoking a joint after a day at work or on a Sunday evening. There is just something about it. But, the thought of getting a preventable cancer, or COPD or something is a huge turn off. This is one of the leading factors that is pushing me to quit permanently.

**Stigma** \- I hide my weed use from most people. I am torn on this one. It makes me sound like a crippled addict. But, I think it is just because of the burnout stoner stigma. I might be one of the most highly motivated people I know, but if the first impression of me is when I am stoned, people would not assume so until they know me better. I always dont want people to know that I smoke almost every day for what I believe is the same reason. Feeling the need to hide my use is concerning but I am torn as to why.

**Gateway** \- I have never used other drugs. I have seen hundreds of lines snorted, mushrooms eaten, and pills popped. But I have never used anything other than weed, alcohol, caffeine, and a few cigarettes in my life. I truly believe I would never touch anything beyond weed either. But, there is always a thought in the back of my head that says ""what if one day weed just is not enough"". Also, and sorry if this is a little personal, it does give me a gateway into binge eating and masturbation. But, again, I can control these urges if I want to. I do not always control the urges as sometimes I just want to be a bit of a glutton. I really do work hard and if I have 5 hours of personal time per week, I feel it is fair to spend it however I choose. Even if it is smoking a joint, eating an entire pizza, and jerking off. It sounds pathetic typing it, but I rationalize this one by saying I am human and I am allowed to be selfish once in a while as long as it does not bleed into other areas of my life.

**Potential** \- This final one is the most important to me. I have accomplished a ton so far in my life. But, my current life is not what I thought it would be when I started university when I was 18. I finished uni, then went  to college for a trade but could not find a job once I graduated. So, I decided to carve out my own path in life and it is paying off financially, but not spiritually. I have an awesome girlfriend, good relationships with people I care about, I will never have financial worries, I am fit, I can be outgoing when I want to be. But, there is always a devil in my ear saying ""imagine if you didnt smoke pot what else you could accomplish"". I do feel like weed limits my potential because I could be using that time while stoned to write papers about what I am passionate about in my industry, I could read more, I could go back to school and do a Masters or even a PHD. But, then I wonder why? If I am already doing very well and am relatively happy, why pursue more? This is where I start to go off the rails philosophically because it opens up a world of ""what-ifs"" and ""what could be"". But spiritually (not religious, but in terms of inner fulfillment), I feel like I am lacking. But, I am unsure if quitting weed is what will help me find that fulfillment. I feel like it is just part of the human condition to always want more when it comes to feeling fulfilled in life. This topic I truly am at a loss with and even considered therapy to help consolidate my thoughts to make sense of them because I feel like I am stuck in my life until I can resolve ""what will make me feel fulfilled"".

That last few sentences of that last paragraph is why I want to quit weed. But, will sobriety really ""unlock"" a new train of thought in a few months down the road? Or will I be exactly where I am still. This is the crux of my reason to quit - because what is the harm in trying?

I've been having issues with my gf lately, and she coincidentally planned to sleep over at a friends house that day. A part of me panicked just thinking I would have to be alone that night so I, like the coward I am, went out for another score and I've been telling myself ""I will not smoke tomorrow"" since then. Now I realize more than ever why I'm scared to stop, I'm too scared to face the long process of fixing a pile of bad decisions. Bad decisions that I can't even tell anyone about, because I'm just too much of a coward to listen to any voice other than the voice in my head, and I can only feel myself pushing that voice away and falling deeper into this empty void of a life",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.886936}"

Today marks 6 months of complete and total sobriety for me after 13 years of constant drug abuse. This community has been absolutely instrumental in my progress and on my journey. So, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate myself and share an update with you all.

Literally every aspect of my life has improved. I certainly wouldn't be able to create an exhaustive list but I'll do my best to highlight the big ones. I sleep better, and less. My nightmares that I used to have to smoke away have naturally receded (I can't tell you how big that is for me). I eat better, and less. I've lost weight. I feel better. My moods are much more stable and longer lasting. I've learned to take the bad with the good and not let a bad hour turn into a bad day. I've improved my emotional regulation skills. I've started exercising regularly. I meditate daily. I found a routine that works for me and I've stuck to it. I've been learning Spanish and guitar. I've learned to enjoy my free time without chemical assistance. I've even learned to be bored sometimes without it causing me problems. There is so much more, but if I were to tell you everything thats improved I'd be here all day. 

Quitting is the best thing I've ever done for myself. The most important things for me to stay quit have been my routine, daily meditation, self-compassion and this community. Quitting hasn't just magically made my life better, but it has given me the power the focus and the commitment for ME to make my life better. Anyone still thinking about quitting, you can do it! I was an absolute emotional wreck and I was certain I would smoke and drink myself to death. And then one day I just realized that I didn't want that, so I started making changes and here I am. If I can do it, YOU CAN DO IT, TOO!

I know this journey is just beginning, but I also know that I have the means, motive and opportunity to continue down the path of sobriety.

If I can offer any advice to anyone, I would be more than happy. And again, thank you to you all for being a part of this wonderful community.",54,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8825911}"

It's also hard growing apart from people, but I now know if I continue being around those buddies I will eventually smoke. It's hard having to make that choice, but I have to make it.

I saw a #lifeprotip on reddit last night to get your nightguard done asap if you're a teeth grinder to save you lots of money down the road. My dentist had previously told me this... 3 years ago... and encouraged me to buy some cheap at home mold ones. So I did. 3 years ago. And when I read the instructions on it (literally 7 steps) I got overwhelmed. I've known I've needed to do it for 3 years. I'd sat down and tried to understand the instructions so many times but I was too high to follow it and then I'd get frustrated and give up. I get chastised every time I go into the dentist about how I won't have teeth left in 20 years at the rate I grind. By the way one of my biggest phobias is losing my teeth. So that should tell you how much anxiety I've had about this for years. Last night after reading the #lifeprotip I pulled out the little kit from where I'd been storing it and set up the boiling water and ice cold water and finished my nightguard in 5 minutes. How embarrassing that I've put this off for YEARS and it was that simple. Anyway. F*** pot. I never want to be the weak and lazy person it made me into again. I have no desire to get high, and I'm so glad I quit when I did even if it was excruciating that first two weeks. If you're struggling to stay sober, stay with it. You deserve to be healthy and motivated!!! Who knows if I ever would have done it if I hadn't quit.

Since I started working on the big quit in Aug 2018 I have had a couple of relapses, but I have been away from weed for approximately 25 months out of the last 29.  That's pretty decent chunk of time considering I started daily usage way back in 1992.  From seed filled brick weed to concentrated wax, it was a long strange trip.  A lot of wasted time and energy in there living the secret agent weed life.

My last two relapse periods were filled with regret.  Both relapses happened at the 6 month timeframe.  Both relapse periods lasted weeks or more.  Every time I got high I was filled with regret.  I already knew that being away from weed had so many positives.  It was impossible not to think about that when I was high.  At that point the only good part about the high was just before I inhaled.  

*I still think of weed pretty much everyday.*  But I don't think about using it.  Not at all.  Now **I think about what a relief it is that I am NOT using it.**  I am so thankful for the positives I have found in my life away from the haze.  I don't want to let those go.  Every day I wake up and realize I made it though one more and I get to keep that list of positives intact.  

I have been spending more time around here responding to low participation posts.  Probably to distract myself from my own life concerns.  I need to find a new job as mine ends soon. I also have a lot of home project related stress.  My moms health is failing and I am responsible for wrapping up her cluttered home.  Marriage stress and drama related to the other stuff.  And of course this whole covid thing.  Middle age is not always easy.  

I could look back with rose colored lenses at the simple early days of weed life.  I could try and run back to the weed safety blanket. Sucking my thumb like Linus.  Instead I am relieved not to have the haze of weed making life even harder.

this is my first post here, been lurking for about a year, getting interested in the community and quitting weed (while simultaneously browsing trees alot, which is so toxic in regards of moderating or quitting).
I am smoking daily since about 4-5 years (since going to university). Since about 2 years I started to smoke from waking up to going to bed its more than often the first thing I do in the morning and the last thing I do in the evening.
There was a moment where I realized my failure In university was in the system itself and the courses I took (in Germany university works a bit different than in US I think) and I was just smoking so much weed to suppress the fact what I was doing was just not my fit.
Last year I quit university to start an apprenticeship in my hometown and I am super happy with how this turned out. Work is super fun, I am earning money which is great -BUT- I still cannot get a grasp on moderating.
When I get home I smoke.
When I got a day of I smoke.
Weekends? Smoke.
Homeoffice? Smoke.
It's like I see how weed got me in its hands but I still can't stop to blatantly lie to myself saying things like ahhh it's just small joints or others drink beer in the evening. Even while I write this, the idea of getting home not smoking all evening makes me start lying again.
I need to just write this down to show myself how ridiculous this all is even though I could write so so much more.
Showing myself what sober me wrote at work while stoned me cannot put me in false comfort.

It was like I wanted to self sabotage or something? Like in my head going yes, everything is back on an even keel, you've rebuilt your life, etc and then it was like I decided to challenge myself to one spliff?! 

I guess I wanted to show that I was in control of the weed like I was in control of the rest of my life (so it felt like at the time, god did I need taking down a peg or two!) but the weed is most definitely still in charge in that situation. It is very hard to admit that something so 'small and insignificant' has more control over you than your own self, I feel like I'm admitting some sort of defeat I don't want to acknowledge over a great battle that I feel I should have won (I know this sounds a tad melodramatic). I know the 'true' winning in this scenario is to defeat the addiction every day by not using, I guess I am just licking my wounds that once again I learned the 'cannot moderate' lesson. 

But as I realised on the last relapse, there are some good things I can pull from this, the 'life rebuilding' work doesn't all go to waste, and hopefully gives me a new baseline for my habits to keep on going from, and remind myself that relapsing when you start from 0, to relapse when you feel like you've made a bit of progress means for me a very different set of emotions and challenges. I'm also just so relieved it was just under a week, I've never had such a short relapse, I guess smoking has become 'ruined' in so many ways for the negative impact is now has rather than any positives from the brief high, I feel like I'm fucking up 22.5 hours in the day to enjoy a short lived high now that's really not that special",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45967817}"

I am 18 and was a daily smoker for 3 years, but for the first time I am officially 10 days sober. In 3 years this is the longest I‚Äôve went without smoking, which feels really good to say. Tonight I had a really intense urge to smoke so I just wanted to talk about it to see if it helps anyone or for maybe some positive comments to help me keep getting through this. 
I‚Äôve tried about 5 times in the last month to stop smoking for a full month (hoping I can go longer than that). I never got past 3 days until now. The other times I tried, I simply couldn‚Äôt get over that urge to smoke even though I knew it would be the same-old high that stopped me from accomplishing any of my goals for years. We all know that shitty high feeling of being groggy all day, saying you‚Äôre gonna do stuff and then smoke instead, blah blah blah. For me I also started experiencing terrible panic attacks, all day depression/anxiety so I‚Äôm truly grateful I found a way to make it to 10 days because at my lowest I wanted to kill myself to be honest........ typing that 10 days sober just made me cry. I can‚Äôt believe I thought of doing something like that to myself but it‚Äôs the truth. 
The first 3 days of weed sobriety I was actually on a short vacation with my friends, and the only reason I didn‚Äôt smoke those days was because my friends aren‚Äôt huge stoners and I simply had no way to get weed, so I figured I HAD to start my journey then, no more bullshit. It was the perfect time to do it, so those 3 nights we got blackout drunk at the bars so I could fall asleep easier, and then I came home. 

The first day I came home was the hardest. I saw all my plugs on their snapchat stories with their fresh bud and my urge was so god damn intense because now that I was home, weed was actually available to me. I cried the whole day because I convinced myself I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to ever be able to do this. Luckily, I cried so much that I passed out from exhaustion and didn‚Äôt have to stay up all night thinking about weed. I even had an episode where I told my mom that I didn‚Äôt think I was going to live for long, that I wasn‚Äôt strong enough, so that was something else. Can you tell yet how hard this was for me? 
Nevertheless, I got through 4 days without smoking. 
Then, on the 5th day, I started to get a little bit of passion and motivation. I suddenly had a desire to go workout, so I went to the gym and literally pounded my muscles until complete exhaustion and I felt amazing. I came home, read 100 pages of this book That I planned on reading for weeks, and I felt even better. Then I went to sleep without really thinking about the weed! I felt great! 
I‚Äôll briefly summarize the next 5 days until now, I had temptations and got pretty irritable mostly at night (including a little right now). However being 10 days in already, I don‚Äôt think I can let myself break this amazing streak of staying strong. The most annoying/challenging thing honestly is that I constantly wake up in the night with cold sweats and extremely vivid nightmares. I had one last night where I got into a car crash with all of my best friends and it felt way too real. So that freaked me out. 

I‚Äôll stop talking about myself for a second, because I also want this to be helpful for anyone else who is starting their journey. It might be the hardest thing you‚Äôve ever done at first, it was for me, but one thing I can promise you is that there is no way you will regret it. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up, please don‚Äôt think of hurting yourself the way I did, because it might take a lot of try‚Äôs to be able to reach your goal. I didn‚Äôt really get through this the way I hoped with all of the drinking/crying/embarrassment, but I freaking made it to 10 days. And I‚Äôm going to sleep well because of that. You can do it, I assure you. Thanks for anyone who read this cause re reading this it just sounds stupid and self centered haha.

2021-01-21 00:39:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/l1s2ml/absolutely_never_give_up_never/,Absolutely never give up. Never.,"I‚Äôm a year and 3 weeks sober from weed. A year and 4 weeks ago I was DEEP into pot. I fucking loved it so much. But I also hated it just as much. I tried so many times to quit smoking and failed so many times. It wasn‚Äôt until 1 year into smoking that I really realized I needed to start trying to quit. I made so many attempts to stop and broke so many times. I thought I was a failure, I thought every attempt proved I couldn‚Äôt break the bad habit. But every time I look back now, every single one of those attempts led to this one, without a doubt. If I never tried and failed, I wouldn‚Äôt be here. So first off, try to break. Just try. What‚Äôs the worst that‚Äôll happen? You‚Äôre gonna smoke? I bet you‚Äôre smoking all the time. So even if it‚Äôs only 1 day, 2 days, a week, beyond that. Absolutely pull all you can to make every attempt as good as you can. If you fail, don‚Äôt fret. Get back up and make another attempt to quit completely. It will feel awful every time you cave. No ones perfect we all cave. But even if you don‚Äôt successfully quit, you will accomplish having less and less time you‚Äôd spent high. It will take a while, a long while, but enjoy the journey. First you‚Äôll be smoking less, then one great day you‚Äôll realize you truly won‚Äôt smoke again.

And for those of you who think it will be a never ending battle, you will always want to smoke no matter how long. I‚Äôm over a year sober and I‚Äôll tell you, it‚Äôs not like that. It‚Äôs hard to even imagine me breaking right now. I still wanna smoke, it‚Äôs fun not gonna lie. But there‚Äôs no version of me that will ever be better than sober for over a year me. Just the thought drives me to such great lengths. Even if tomorrow I decided I‚Äôm smoking again, I‚Äôd have to call bullshit on that statement immediately. I simply cannot imagine actually going and doing it. As hard as it might be for some of you right now to not cave, I feel it‚Äôs even harder for me to actually cave. Trust me, it gets so much easier eventually. So much. The thought that honestly I can say I‚Äôm free, is so amazing. You all can get here to. I believe in you! 

A few things I believe helped me get this far that you all can do too: Tell yourself you can do it, even if in the back of your head you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true. I faked it till I made it. I told myself every time ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done, I‚Äôm making this year 100 percent‚Äù and it freaking worked lmao. Keep yourself busy. This is so important for quitting many bad habits. Find new hobbies/habits and do them. Improve your life, there are things you know you need to do with your life, and since weed isn‚Äôt in the way for this period of time, it better now than ever before. A few examples: working out, fixing your sleep schedule, getting a job, doing those things you‚Äôve always wanted to do, being generally healthier, work on school/ things you need to get done. Delete/ block all your dealers/ people you only hangout with to smoke. This was the very first thing I did in the year. Who would‚Äôve been able to guess that not seeing deals on my Snapchat all the time would help? Everyone lol. Very important. If you can‚Äôt do that, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. If you genuinely want weed out of your life, keep the people that keep it in your life, out of your life. You do all these things, you will be a whole different person and you‚Äôll be smoking less/ not at all. Good luck everyone. Do not allow yourselves to stay limited by this stupid drug. I‚Äôll see you all in this side, the sober side. Anyone feel free to message me anytime, I will respond ASAP unless I‚Äôm super busy. ‚úåÔ∏è",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4110053}"

The first 3 months were frightening and anxious and overwhelming and unbearable. The nightmares, irritability, panic and empty free time was excruciating in the beginning. 

I feel like my whole life has opened up before me, when I was using it was like reliving the same day over and over again. My memory was shot, I was in my head all the time, and I was reckless and enabled by my addiction. I lost all my stoner ‚Äòfriends‚Äô. Now I have goals, motivation and genuine pride and happiness with myself and my life for the first time ever. 

Things that helped me:
- Journaling helped me see the same cycle I was putting myself through repeatedly. Also helped reveal other addictions such as social media and codependency
- Fellowship meetings helped me see this is a legitimate addiction and gave me accountability and humility. Connection is the opposite of addiction
- Books about cannabis addiction helped me understand what was going on biologically, stopped the shame of not being able to stay sober through free will
-  I didn‚Äôt drink the first ten months, didn‚Äôt want to make myself vulnerable to an impulsive decision
- Exercise/yoga gave me a new outlet to unwind
- Time alone in nature helped me be honest with myself

My last day smoking wasn‚Äôt my last day in my head. It wasn‚Äôt a big decision, it was a random Monday. I decided to not smoke just for that day. And I did that the next day and the next and the next.

Strong urge to relapse due to loneliness, boredom and frustration with career *rant*","I was doing fine up to this point, but I have a very strong urge this evening to give in.

There's a few things that are bothering me. I've been completely sober from weed/alcohol. I'm just sitting alone almost all the time, isolated in my own thoughts. I have no friends and no social life, especially with the pandemic, I do nothing. 

Mostly I just read the news and listen to music in my free time.

Also, I hate my current job. I cut my hours back substantially due to depression. I'm studying for a certificate test in order to upgrade my job, however, I've been struggling hugely studying for it. I just can't seem to focus consistently enough, it's a very difficult test for me, I've failed before.

Today I just had immense brain fog. It's like a mental wall holding me back.

I'm just really frustrated with the way my life is, yet it feels like a monumental task to change my life.

I was complacent for many years just working low-end jobs being a stoner getting high all day everyday.

Now suddenly I'm 27 and reality is sinking in. I haven't really accomplished anything. I've been trying to pull myself out of this but I'm depressed.

&#x200B;

A part of me just wants to say screw it and get high. The rational side of me is holding off, trying to push through but the truth is I know this feeling before, and it's what caused me to relapse hundreds of times before. (I've literally tried quitting hundreds of times, longest I went was 10 months.)

I've always known weed was bad for me but I guess just the complete lack of social life I've experienced, and the lack of enjoyment and satisfaction in my life has been detrimental to my persistance. 

In 2019 I had the best time of my life, I was sober most of the time, I just worked hard all year and travelled to Thailand, I had a blast and it really opened my eyes that travelling was something I really enjoyed.

Now, I can't go anywhere, can't do anything, stuck in isolation. So what am I supposed to do? Sure, someone could tell me go for a walk, occupy my mind, learn something, but I could care less about most things right now.  Like I said, I'm depressed. The relief I get from being high is just such a good way for me to cope. Don't know what to do at this point... I need things to change, but the reality is this pandemic is dragging on and on, it's going to take a lot of time to pull myself out of this rut.",10,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.79206306}"

I used it to escape from the reality of the abusive relationship I was in from 15-18. Ive always struggled with pretty bad social anxiety, but I always at least had friends until my ex cut me off from all of them and kept me from making new ones. 

Eventually I lost any and all ability to communicate with people. I cant connect full coherent sentences in my head so I have to type everything out if I want to talk to someone about something important, and I ALWAYS end up oversharing and making people uncomfortable because it just feels nice to put my thoughts out there. I probably wouldn't be with my incredible and supportive boyfriend right now if we didn't meet online and I wasn't able to lay all of this out for him clearly.
I literally cannot have conversations with people unless they do 100% of the talking and I keep them going by acting interested with short responses and obvious/simple questions. I used to be extremely bright, a ""gifted child"" if you will. I was funny. Now I am pretty dumb, dull and lifeless, incredibly awkward, and always overly polite to make up for it. 

I used to think I might be autistic (still a possibility, but not for these reasons), I thought it was just the person I am and there's nothing I could do about it. Im so incredibly thankful I've found this sub. You've all helped me realize not only that my relationship with weed was a huge problem, but was responsible for most of the things I wished I could change about myself.

I'm 4 days sober and going strong. The withdrawals do nothing but reaffirm my need to stay sober. My only worry is that I have wrecked my personality so much that I will never get it back. I want to be able to talk to strangers, be personable and funny with my clients at work, be fully able to communicate to my boyfriend how great and important he is and fully integrate myself into his family. I just want to connect with people again. Its been so long and I've been so lonely. Will this get better? Any advice how to help with these things would be much appreciated.

A big reason for it is how easily available it is. Before weed was legal, I would have to go through the trouble of knowing a dealer, making the effort to drive there, make sure I‚Äôm not getting ripped off, etc. and if I still had to go through all that, it would be easier to quit.

Daily weed and boozer from 18 up until last year when I decided to take a serious stance on my drinking which was causing all sorts of problems in my life. With the help of AA and zoom meetings I was able to kick the booze, but in my head I was focused on just the alcohol, and continued to use marijuana to help me get through it. While I've been happy with my recovery, I'm starting to get to the point where I'm thinking that the weed is holding me back in my life. I've been a daily smoker for 15 years now and so it has become such a friendly comfortable habit at this point. But I'm really  starting to think about how its holding me back in finding any sort of true serenity and joy in sobriety, and has enabled me to wallow in passivity, lack of direction, low self esteem, anxiety, and aimlessness. I gave up boozing to try and turn my life around, and in alot of ways my life has gotten better because of it,but I'm starting to  realize that my daily weed smoking has had more negative effects than I want to admit.

  Throughout high school I wasn‚Äôt the one to be going to parties and stuff like that so I was never exposed to any type of drugs (except maybe once at a kid cudi show when I was an 8th grader, whole venue was hotboxed but I didn‚Äôt smoke haha) and graduated high school without smoking a single joint. Life happened and I was feeling more and more down thinking how I wasn‚Äôt gonna ‚Äúmake it‚Äù in life, literally to the point of suicidal ideation. I hit rock bottom around summer 2018 where life came at me full swing and I didn‚Äôt know where to look. Eventually my brother in law gives me a hit of his wax pen and man oh man I had the night of my life, everything that seemed to be a big issue turned into crumbs, life was suddenly no big deal and everything happens for a reason my life had changed for in my eyes, the better. 

  Around this time is when I started a new job as a server, all my coworkers were around my age and loved the party life with alcohol weed and pills. I ‚Äújoined‚Äù the weed circle cause why the fuck not, right? After work we would hot box one of our cars and go to a nearby McDonalds, my order always consisted of at least 5 McChckens, always. 

  This went on around  the end of 2018 to mostly 2019 where I felt this euphoria of escaping reality for the night. Most of my online gaming nights with my friends would be abandoned cause I wanted to go smoke a bowl instead. I insisted that it would make the night even better but all it did was make me end up ordering 5+ McChickens through DoorDash and pass out while watching YouTube videos while in a Discord chat. 

I always used weed to temporarily fix my problems but in reality they were never fixed, just pushed aside for the night. This led me to struggle in my classes since I would push assignments aside to go smoke, which would then get me stressed the next morning cause I was now behind on homework. Can you guess what I did to help ease the stress of not having my assignments done? If you guessed smoke then I‚Äôm calling the police cause you know me too well haha. Basically this vicious cycle continued on to the point where I had to withdraw from the course cause I fell too hard behind. I felt hopeless, I felt useless, I felt like a piece of trash. 

  In between all of this I had small gaps of unsuccessfully ‚Äúquitting‚Äù weed. My surroundings didn‚Äôt help since weed was a call away or even right next to me after work. But now I‚Äôm being 100% committed and finding this subreddit and lurking for a bit has helped me stay off the weed for good.

Thats when i started using weed, lsd, e mushrooms and salvia. By the time i was in grade 12 i was on my own working full time amd trying to finish school, my life quickly got worse and worse within 2 years i was homeless breaking into a gym to sleep on the mats at night.

I got clean of everything but weed, because after all i could be a productive stoner right? No there is no stoners there are addicts.

And thats where i stayed for the next 12 years of my life. Barely making enough money to stay afloat. To much of a coward to take any steps to change.

A few months ago i got a big promotion at work,  i used all my extra money for weed. 

For the last month ive been smoking 7grams of white widow a day. Major league numbers not rookie numbers...

On sunday i woke up sick dry heaving, cramps dehydrated, threw up in my mouth. I had no idea what CHS was i had been feeling this way for years on and off i thought it was due to azthma.

Needless to say it did not get better as the day went on and i felt terrible.

My doctor told me i probably had chs and i needed to quit. Wow wtf is chs...  

Thats when i discovered you all, i spent the last 3 days 9 hours and 10 minutes reading all your posts. I felt like i wasnt alone and i could do this.

This is the longest i have been sober since i was 16 and im 32 now. Half my life gone.

It sucks so bad, i hate everything i was and i look forward to meeting myself.

so i didnt do it bc i wanted to this i did it bc i was forced to do this. in the end when i look back this was the only thing that could stop my chronic usage of 2-3gs every day. i smoked for 12 years. its still in waves sometimes i miss it sometimes i dont, deep down in my heart iam still a stoner and want to smoke all the time its still not that easy as i thought it would hopefully be after 1 year.

i still smoke cigs tho and this alot more than in my stoner days, a pack lasts me 3-4 days back than now barely 1 day and i kinda hate it but yeah addiction is a devil but at least this addiction doesnt make me foggy  and give me panik attacks. but on the other hand iam thinking if i smoke and damage my lungs i still wanna hit that joint and forget about all my feelings and worries and just chill.

&#x200B;

i read tons of topics over the last year here and the main thing i learned just stop smoking weed doesnt make anything better you have to force yourself to become a better and healtier person iam still struggling in this state where iam thinking what are the real benefits of stopping. for sure 1 big thing is money but that wasnt a problem back than bc i was dealing bc i needed 600-700euros each month for my addiction. but besides that i sleep much better and deeper. i gained nearly 10 kilos which is weird am getting a bit fat lol never was in this situation before.

iam forcing myself to get out and do a run and train at home but my inner voice is making things so hard i still kinda life my stoner life without smoking. also really weird in my case when i wake up in the morning i feel more tired and down before i was smoking 24/7....i have to attend at least 1 more year with a clinic psycholgist bc this event 1 year ago fucked me up and my family and i have so many things to get thru and over but iam hoping and will force exactly this:  when i look back in maybe 5 years or so i wanna be somewhere where i could never be bc i smoked all the time and did literally nothing besides party and taking drugs....so iam finished with my rant lol. today is not my day but i write this to keep me commited to go for another year.

New here but been lurking the past week. I've been a smoker for about 9 years- being in the UK this means I've always mixed tobacco in my spliffs/ joints. I've smoked daily for the past 6ish years, often up to 5 a day. 

Decided to quit on Saturday after my first time doing a 'cupping' therapy, which tbh I'm not even convinced about, but just made me think about the toxins in my body.  Want to preserve my lungs, bank balance (prob spend ¬£300 a month on it) and general laziness (not toooo bad as I work fill time in a decent job, work out multiple times per week etc.). 

Currently on day 4 - to be honest it hasn't been too bad, minus  the odd craving at night when I have a bit of a void from not smoking (i.e. just habit), some trouble sleeping and a couple of headaches. Definitely not got the same sugar/ snack cravings either. Not sure whether these are down to weed or nicotine but still..

One thing I've noticed potentially is my libido isnt quite as high as it has been. I've been abstaining from porn too for a couple of weeks so maybe my brain is just going through a bit of a change. Anyone else have this (or the opposite -any sexual benefits such as harder boners lol)? 

When I started I thought 'I'll probably just not smoke alone but will now and again with friends' but to be honest I'm not sure I want to do that, certainly not for a few months. Still in favor of legalisation etc. though.

So yeah cheers for the support community. Been logging on here when im getting a craving and its been keeping me going. From what I read its worth it!

Thanks.

Got up, had some nice piano/drum practice. at 2ish I started feeling really irritable. D,Z, and I went on a walk. During the walk, I was discussing some of my depression. Sometimes this can be helpful and positive, sometimes it makes my depression worse. Next time I will pay closer attention to the motivations for the conversation as well as the headspace I currently occupy. In retrospect, it seems obvious that I should have understood I was feeling irritable (which I did do in the moment) and then realize that maybe that isn't the best time for a discussion on depression.   


Got home and was feeling really low. I took a nap from 3ish-6:30ish. I had a new shrink apt scheduled for 7pm. Basically, there was a bait and switch, my parents confirmed with his office (and our insurance) that he took our insurance. This means the apt would be free to me because ALL telemedicine apts are 100% covered for us. Well when I was trying to get into the chat, I had to use a new app (TRIGGER) that was frustrating. When I finally got to the last step, the app told me it would charge my CC $275 for the apt. I canceled (which cost $75) and was angry. Then the shrink called me to find our what was going on. After he tried explaining to me that I didn't understand how my health insurance works, (something about the company that purchases the insurance selects a network but that he isn't in-network even though his office and the insurance company confirmed as much. I told him that the company that purchases the insurance (UHC) is the same company that provides it (UHC). Then he tells me that I still don't understand, and intimates that either me or my parents are lying. I tell him that my current shrink doesn't work this way (despite his claim that ALL psyches work this way) and as I'm talking he continues to interrupt me. I explode, see red, and begin laying into him about how he is a this and that. Not really sure exactly what I said because I was literally in a blind rage. I hung up and tried fixing myself some dinner, but couldn't contain my rage. I decided to go for a walk in 30-degree weather with sandals on. After a short walk I'm feeling way better and strategize how to overcome this B.S. rage issue. Talk to my folks for a bit (dad started practicing Buddhism in part to deal with rage issues) We have a nice chat and I'm feeling even better. 9pm rolls around, I take my meds and D and I lay in bed for a while and chat, feed Z. I'm feeling way better at this point. I post a bunch of stuff of r/leaves, encouraging other folks who are also struggling, then off to sleep.

Well I‚Äôve made it well over 8.5 months. I‚Äôve been trying to stay away from posting, but I feel as though I should give an update on how im feeling. 

I‚Äôm definitely in the ‚Äúwaves‚Äù phase of all this, with some symptoms being consistent. I tie this over to my sleep which is still very much awful for the past 8 months. I very rarely have a night where I can sleep for at least 6-7 hours straight, but most of the time im still experiencing interrupted sleep. It sucks. I look like a zombie. 

Everything else comes in waves, body pains, heart racing, anxiety, brain fog, muscle twitches, hot flashes, flu like symptoms, stomach discomfort, random muscle jolts.. the first 4 months I had very few consistent symptoms, it wasnt until month 5 that a lot of symptoms I got over randomly came back & still sometimes come back. It‚Äôs very tiring to say the least, I feel 70-80% physically, but mentally I can say I feel like im 85-90% of who I was. 

Now everyone doesn‚Äôt get PAWS, if you unfortunately do like I & countless others do; stay quit & honor your body. Remember that PAWS time no matter how tough it gets, can only heal you. I‚Äôve read up on worse case scenarios & everyone comes out fine in the end. It sucks, but I‚Äôm willing to saddle down & fight through my tears just to get to where I want to be. I continue to stay optimistic & hope this gets better. I hope my body doesn‚Äôt decline due to poor sleep. But hey, it‚Äôs been a good run. It‚Äôs been so tough, & I‚Äôm posting this after a night of horrible sleep that lowkey demoralizes me, but im still very happy I made the decision to quit weed.

2021-01-20 03:01:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/l14qru/12_months_today/,12 months today,"Hi Leavers,

Today, 12 months ago, I decided to stop abusing weed. The decision was made, the journey seemed steep, maybe almost unsurmountable. Then COVID-19 happened and that strengthened my resolve. Somehow I was very aware that if I would pick up smoking while being locked up in my flat for weeks, that would send me right into a tailspin. It was hard, I craved and craved. Slowly, I started to find alternatives: i planted a garden on my rooftop. I started playing bass, I picked up drawing again. I worked hard and came up with work solutions for the problems COVID posed for us. 
I realised weed wasn't really the problem. It just put the solution out of reach. So I had to tackle my issues. In the midst of these times were loneliness hit hard, but I was fortunate to still have a job and housing, I carried on. 
Now, 12 months later, it's hard for me to imagine my addicted self. I feel I've grown so much. I still have dark moments, but they pass quickly. I think what I learned most is to be kind to myself, to celebrate each win, no matter how small. To give myself the emotional fuel I need for this journey. At a certain moment, I relapsed for a week. I decided not to put my head down in defeat and reset the count. I decided to just quit again and go on. Being kind to myself, avoiding the emotional crash, and making sure I caught myself quickly and get back on track right away.

Pain is temporary, the benefits of quitting are permanent!","Hey everyone! I'm 31, and have smoked (spliffs) every day since I was 21, self medicating for ADHD.

I decided to quit on January 3rd after using the rest of my stash, because in the last few years I've realised I don't deal well with stress, and have a very short temper, due to constantly being 'hungover' from smoking.

The first sign of stress or discomfort, and I would turn to weed to make it all go away. As I'm trying for a baby with my wife, I knew I didn't want to continue down this path and had to make a change.

I've never ever struggled to sleep (even before weed) but for the last 7 nights I've been managing only a couple of hours each night, and it's exhausting. I've not had any of the vivid dreams I read about, and in fact I wish I could sleep long enough to have a dream of any sort. I look like shit, have big bags under my eyes, and am struggling to hold it together with work (I might take a few days off, we'll see).

I know that this is all part of the process, and despite feeling exhausted and Zombie-like for the past week, I know that's it's worth it. The easy option would be to go and buy a bag to help me sleep, but it won't solve the problem long-term, and I'll be back at square one.

I'm a better husband, a better son, more grateful for what I have, better at showing it, and more 'in-the-moment'. 

I know my sleep cycles will sort themselves out in time, and these issues are temporary. The pain and exhaustion are necessary. I see it as payment for what I've been doing to my body for the last decade. 

The benefits will last forever though, and that's what I keep focusing on. If you're in a similar position DO NOT let it beat you, it's not forever.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.53362304}"

Not just smoking for three years, but literally HIGH the whole time from the moment my eyes opened each day to the moment of sleep. The ‚Äòdecline‚Äô this has created in my life has been so gradual that I didn‚Äôt notice it for so long. Here I am now at age 22, three years into my smoking habit, with no savings, no college, no concrete goals, and working a wage job I hate. I feel like I am waking up in a fog, barely aware of what‚Äôs been happening in my life for the last three years. It‚Äôs almost like my nearly-dead soul is coming up for air saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here... somewhere, amongst all the smoke and lost time.‚Äù The worst part about weed for me and the main reason I have decided to quit is LACK OF MOTIVATION! I used to have my hands into everything, filming videos, releasing them to YouTube, podcasting. I was even making enough money to pay the rent for several months from my content. The old me would NEVER settle for mediocrity! Fast forward to today and I am typing this as I approach my 5th hour lying down in the shower... immovable, unmotivated, depleted, depressed, and wasting water! I feel absolutely stuck to the ground, dead, and lethargic. The only thing slightly productive I‚Äôve managed to do is learn guitar over the past year, but I know I could make so much more progress in each sitting by LETTING GO OF THIS DAMN BURDEN! I used to love weed, but it just isn‚Äôt the same... It‚Äôs kinda old. In fact it‚Äôs very old... I don‚Äôt get high anymore, and I just can‚Äôt regulate its use as a ‚Äòcreative‚Äô aid. If I smoke once, I‚Äôm still puffing hours later, simple as that. I HAVE to accept that there is no ‚Äòregulation‚Äô for me. A 12-pack of beer sits in my fridge for months, rarely touched. Weed disappears immediately regardless of the money spent, time wasted, or previous hits already taken. ‚ÄòREGULATION‚Äô is the addict talking again, at least for me. Why ‚Äòregulate‚Äô something that doesn‚Äôt need regulation because it isn‚Äôt necessary in the first place? I want freedom, not regulation. Let me close this by saying I don‚Äôt hate weed and I absolutely don‚Äôt deny the positive aspects of occasional ‚Äòpsychological/spiritual‚Äô use. This isn‚Äôt about the plant itself. It‚Äôs about MY RELATIONSHIP to it. If I could be happy, content, and levelheaded smoking a couple times a week while still getting my shit done that would be one thing, but I‚Äôve never been able to do that. Getting real shit done like this has always been a joke. As much as I will miss it in a way, it‚Äôs time to move on in my life, say thank you for what I‚Äôve learned, and discover my next love which will not be a substance, but will be productive hobbies and routines. Hopefully my motivation isn‚Äôt shot forever. That‚Äôs my main concern. I want to be that go-getter again who is always dabbling in shit and taking creative action. I want to heal from my social anxiety and be unstoppable in life. I want to live a life that makes it all worth it, despite my inevitable death. Staying stoned and doing nothing is not that life for me. I am doing this for my future, one I can see that is free of pot smoke, and free of insecurity/anxiety.

There are a few aggravating factors.

When she isn‚Äôt eating, she has trouble holding her bladder and frequently forgets where her litter box is.

She probably would‚Äôve died outside with this winter cold so I feel good that way, but I am constantly agitated already by not smoking, but having her in the house has been a real challenge.

I recently began to live in a new city and my roommate always has weed and often gives me a lot of it for free. However even prior to moving here, I was smoking a lot.

About a year later, my dad died, and of course I didn't stop smoking. We smoked after he died, we smoked after his funeral. It didn't seem right but after a while it became normal. Smoking weed became my coping mechanism at this young age of 14 and I accepted it, but I didn't realize the full impact of relying on a substance to cope. It didn't mess up my life and I consider myself successful now. I smoked weed everyday all but one year in college, and I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree, got internships and now have a full time job. I'm not saying this to jerk myself off, I'm saying it because I've used my ""success,"" especially in recent years, to justify smoking. I will tell myself ""Oh I don't smoke as much as heavy stoners"" (I don't go to work high and only smoke at night) or justify it by the fact that I don't spend a shitload of money on it. I minimize the problem so much that it ends up not being a problem at all, in my head at least.

More and more I realize how fucked up my brain chemistry is because of daily smoking and because of how young I started. It was my coping mechanism in the worst time in my life and I still hold onto that. Today is day 2 without weed, and I need something to be different this time. I have tried countless times to quit, I have tried countless times to do it in moderation and for me (and probably most of you) moderation is not an option. Once I get that coping feeling back, I start to rely on it, crave it, and I will inevitably start smoking every day again. When I quit for over a year in college, I started meditating every day and I contribute that to my long term sobriety success. I am going to start meditating again soon, I think I need to. It helped me tremendously with other problems in my life as well.

My message to all of you: don't minimize the problem. Be 100% honest with yourself. If it is your coping mechanism like it is mine, realize that there are much healthier coping strategies without all the negative effects. You can get through this, and the vast majority of the time: you won't miss it. I didn't miss it during that year until I got a craving. Had I rejected that craving I might still be sober from it. But as soon as you give in, you will miss it, and you will repeat the cycle. Be strong, don't give in, and I will try to take my own advice.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45015496}"

Any help would be appreciated.,"We've been together for 8 years and I've smoked pot with him the whole time. I've quit for my own reasons and don't expect him to. However, as much as I try and be nice and ask him not to smoke around me (or load it, or grind it, or do anything with it) he just doesn't think it's hurting me to do so since I seem like I'm doing OK. Believe me, I'm super jealous and still want to smoke every day. And he just gets mad and says stuff like ""so am I supposed to pretend like pot doesn't exist?"". Well, ya, kinda. I've smoked for 15 years. Just because I've been sober for a couple of months now doesn't mean it's any easier for me to be around it. My house still smells like it. He still grows and has buckets of it around. I'm trying to be as understanding with him as possible while struggling on my own.

In the month of December I had 2 relapses as mentioned in a previous post. Since Jan 1, I have been running strong. This thread was motivational seeing all the people quit.

My issue was I was always around people who smoke and I still am. However after essentially getting this out my system, I DO NOT FEEL THE URGE OR CRAVING to smoke. In fact it disgusts me to think I would want to do that. Which is an amazing feeling. I switched my perspective on how I view weed, especially more recently.

In fact, I‚Äôve decided one of the best ways to combat my urge is to push my friends to quit as well by reiterating how great I feel and how great they‚Äôll feel too. 2/5 have stopped to begin the year. 

Anyways to anyone who‚Äôs struggling with quitting, my advice is change your perspective on it. Tell yourself you hate it. Tell yourself it makes you worse not better.

Something inside me said this habit is not sustainable and decided to quit on Jan 1st. It's getting easier and withdrawal symptoms have almost subsided. That being said, there are times when a strong urge to smoke comes. Previously, I'd just give in and call up my dealer but this time around I have been able to stay strong and resist the urge. 

That's not to say it's easy but I keep reinforcing myself with a few statements that helps me, so I thought it would be worthwhile sharing with this community and learn from others how they manage their cravings. 

Here's some things I tell myself when the craving comes:

\- How I will feel after I smoke will be drastically different from how I think I will feel. They will never align. 

\- Don't waste the effort of last 20 days for a 20 minute high

\- Weed won't kill me but it can kill the person I can become (this one I read on a post here and it stuck with me)

\- Weed is a temporary escape that hinders my ability to deal with the root cause of why I want to escape

\- Let's just try to get through today without weed, we'll deal with tomorrow's emotions tomorrow.

What also helps when I get cravings is to close my eyes and imagine smoking weed and feeling like shit and guilty after for doing it. I try to connect with that shitty feeling and realize it's not worth it.

But-- getting to the title of this post. This has been the easiest day 1 yet, because I have incorporated \*lots\* of exercise into my day.

Earlier today, I did Day 1 of Yoga With Adrienne's 30 day yoga challenge (its on youtube). It was a 40ish minute video and afterwards I felt so relaxed :)

Then, I did 2 miles on my treadmill (thank God I brought it in-- it works great for only being $250!) which took me around 30 minutes but meh, I was doing intervals and just wanted to get the miles in and sweat a little bit.

Then I did my squats and pushups. 50 squats (split into two 25 sessions)  and 8 pushups (don't make fun haha, I'm a squiggly armed creature right now) . Tomorrow I'll focus on core exercises a long with more yoga.

I feel really great, guys! I know its probably the endorphins because even my chronic back pain is gone right now.

Just wanted to encourage you all -- no matter where you are on your journey, if you've unfortunately relapsed or staying strong-- exercise is so good for you and will help you in whatever state you're in and will undoubtedly reduce cravings!

I wanted to make a post about my experience on this sub since I read a lot about other people's experiences with quitting and withdrawals but never had a discription that fully fit mine own. I hope this post helps others that might be in my position. My main reason to quit was physical anxiety symptoms becoming debilitating with or without being high. 

I was smoking for the better part of 5 years. Started being a daily smoker the summer after I graduated high school. Had a close knit group of friends I gamed with and did everything together including smoking. Even in college we hung out a lot back in our hometown and today are still close. I am probably the first to fully quit. I was pretty much high all throughout college and would consider myself to be a moderate to heavy user. Bongs, bowls, js, blunts, rig dabs, pen dabs, hot knife, grav bongs, vapes, volcanos etcetc. During this time I also vaped a good bit of nic and smoked some cigs time to time. No drinking since I'm not a fan but I was also lazy and lived like shit most of my days. 

My problem with panic and anxiety started when I went off to grad school last year. Pretty much realized I hated what I was doing as a seperate issue and a couple panic attacks confirmed it (I actually interpreted it at the time as major health anxiety). Ended up leaving halfway through my first year about 3 weeks before lockdowns hit. I was able to tame panic pretty well through therapy and better support systems but I was still smoking albeit less than usual since I wasn't with friends. I kicked vaping during the lockdowns and have been clean from that till now with no relapses.

Skip to this fall, I start feeling weird physical anxiety symptoms I have never felt before even with panic issues previously. Racing heart, pounding heart, cold chills all over body, hot flashes, cold hands and feet, sweats all over, night sweats, general malaise feeling, tightness in chest, and hyper vigilant thoughts about health. These would come on randomly or from intrusive thoughts but once it started I couldn't kick it for like 4 days and when I woke up in mornings it would immediately start again. Had a couple trips to urgent care during this time. This would also debilitate me to the point where I couldn't do anything I liked even if I wanted to. I couldn't game, eat, go out and walk, talk with friends, no hobbies at all. Nothing. It all made me feel worse but just sitting there doing nothing made me feel even worse since I was alone with just my thoughts. The cycle was horrible. If I would smoke, almost always I would get way more panicky and anxious so I would pretty much stop for a few days or so. At some point I came onto this sub and learned that weed withdrawal is a real thing and that I was feeling a combination of both major anxiety and withdrawal and I was doing it over and over again every few days to weeks. I quit at that point and told myself it was okay to have relapses but everytime it's much easier to maintain control and much quicker to be relieved.

It's been 4 weeks and I'm glad I quit. I was using it as a crutch when I told myself for years I enjoyed it when in reality I didn't. I don't think about the causes of that as much since I'm focused on the future where I don't feel like that anymore. In the 4 weeks I've been off of it I have had one anxious bout and it was so much more manageable. To anyone that may be in my position or close to it, I urge you to try and quit without thinking that weed is what keeps you happy and well. Withdrawal is a bitch but man the anxiety was much much worse.

I‚Äôm 23 and have been graduated for a year now and I believe the longest I‚Äôve gone without smoking has been 3 days in that span. It‚Äôs cost me money and time, among many other things.

I used to tell myself that I just loved weed and that it was a better alternative to drinking because I saved money and prevented hangovers. But the deeper I fall into this pit, the more I want out. 

I usually get off of work, get a good workout in, and then return home to immediately smoke weed.

And the first month is when I instantly felt results. The growth I've had is unbelievable, both my mental and physical well being have developed so so much. 

A little bit about my story here, I started smoking when I was 18(23 now). I was going through a breakup in high school and started to fall into the wrong crowd. I started smoking daily at 18 years old and I'm talking 6-7 bong tokes a day which at the time has very serious effects on a 18 year old brain. I smoked everyday for 4-5 years. I smoked because I was misinformed of how it was a ""drug"" I was using it as an excuse not to deal with my emotions and issues. People used to say ""Oh its natural, its just a plant, everybody smokes, Snoop Dogg smokes, etc."" just to get me to join them and I always did. It took me years to finally realize what the effect of smoking had on me. Years of smoking went by and there wasn't one instance where I even correlated how I was feeling about weed. I was numb to it, a zombie to this drug and I barely remember anything that had happened in the last few years. It took constant self-awareness and the feelings of dependency and addiction was building to the point where I knew it became a problem.

Being self-aware is the FIRST step in quitting. Be aware of your emotions, understand how you feel when your supply runs out. Ask yourself questions. ""Why am I feeling like this?"" correlate it to whats going on. Train your brain to understand the correlation between addiction and negative thoughts. Focus on other aspects of life. The interesting thing is when you tell your stoner friends you are going to quit most of them wont react positively. Some may never talk to you again and thats OK, you never needed them anyway. They dont benefit your life and wont have your back when you're down, they're using you as an excuse to keep up with their own bad habits. 

Its only been 3 months and the high I get from life beats any bong toke, any joint, any edible. And I get that life is full of ups and downs and sometimes its okay to not be okay. That's completely true, what is NOT ok is to deal with your issues by using a substance that not only drains your bank account but also damages your mental health. Life is supposed to be stressful, its supposed to be amazing and that's how we GROW. People who use weed to ENHANCE life is completely different then what WE use it for, and that's to get THROUGH life and thats the unhealthy part. Because the ups and downs in life and to deal with them sober. Thats what true growth is, I truly believe that every person has a purpose and a potential to be great, and through our own experiences and development is how we find it. I know its hard to jump into and quit immediately, I'm not saying quit right now and completely change your life in one day. Start small and reflect big, whether it be buying less weed for the week, reading at least 10 pages per night, reflect/meditate for 5 minutes and be only 1% BETTER everyday. 

In only 3 months of quitting I have found a completely different career path that doesn't drain me, I have started a side business in mindset coaching. My hobbies changed from watching TV, playing video games and binge eating to working out, meditating and reading. Your path may be different but the result is the same, its pure happiness. 

TLDR: Becoming self aware and understanding yourself is the first step to quitting. Ask yourself questions and be aware of how you feel after/before smoking. Drop the bullshit excuses and shitty friends who dont care about you. Find your passion and try new things. And remember that life is a process, enjoy the little things and always reflect.",20,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49718556}"

I'm pretty proud, because I was smoking from dawn till midnight before. There were a lot of reasons for me to stop smoking, but the main one is that I'm pretty sure it tightens all the muscles in my lower half. I felt constipated, all the time, and I thought it was lactose intolerance but I haven't had any dairy in months. 

I'd always have to force my bowel movements, and it'd always come out stringy or grainy. Its painful on the toilet, and it just feels like it's RIGHT THERE throughout the day. And the rectum tightness fucked with my dick. While sober, I could barely get hard, and when I did I came really really fast. This was crazy because I used to be able to control my orgasms fine before hand, before I smoked, and even for the first year I smoked. With my second girlfriend I had to teach myself how to nut with a condom on, and now I can barely hold it together for a couple minutes. 

In the last few months I hooked up with two girls, and with one I smoked with everytime, and I did everything I wanted to do, and the other, I stayed sober for. With her, it all ended in a few minutes. I hate this shit, and after reading that weed can increasingly stimulate your muscles with too much use, I stopped. I'm also pretty skinny and pretty anxious already. 

But I quit two weeks ago, and my bowel movements aren't much better. They are slowly, slowly getting a little more often and smooth, but it's still not normal. And it's still hard for me to get erect, and while I do, I feel like I have to pee (aka nut) the whole time. It's been two weeks, I would have thought I'd have flushed it out by now. I thought I'd be good to go by now. Did anybody else have this problem with heavy smoking? Did anybody deal with this for a long time after stopping.

I feel like getting into carts is what‚Äôs ended up making this withdrawal process much more tough in the long run. Being able to take puffs whenever you want (and the thc % being much stronger) it was too easy to get away with. I had to stop cold turkey because this was the first time i‚Äôve really decided to ‚ÄúQuit‚Äù and i‚Äôm making it the only time I ‚ÄúQuit‚Äù because i‚Äôm far more productive sober. Man the mental part is a journey (way more than physical) but seeing every else‚Äôs experiences help me in knowing the battle it takes to break up with weed. Just wanted to make an introductory post and can‚Äôt wait to see how I feel after finishing my first month!

I‚Äôm no medical expert or anything but I smoked pretty heavily for around 5 years and decided to quit for good the end of last March I believe. For the majority of being off weed I experienced what a lot of people would consider PAWS and that lasted for around 7-8 months. Throughout this time my moods were all over the place and I attribute that to my testosterone levels slowly rising to normal after years of marijuana abuse.

The only reason I‚Äôm posting this is because I‚Äôve read a fair amount of posts where people talk about how they don‚Äôt feel any different after quitting and decide they might as well go back to weed. 

Patience is key here because your testosterone isn‚Äôt gonna rise to where it once was before you started smoking in a month or even a few months, it‚Äôll likely take over half a year like it did for me. 

I recently discovered how essential testosterone is for your overall mood and how low levels can lead to depression if not treated.

Not saying this is the case for everyone but if you‚Äôre thinking of going back to weed because you don‚Äôt feel normal PLEASE wait it out and see how good it‚Äôll feel to wake up everyday feeling like you can handle life again! 

I hope this helps some of you!",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47373486}"

Before that, I only drank socially for about 20 years since I gave up the stoner life after high school. One thing I realized recently was what I call a downward spiral of weed addiction. This won't apply to all, but for people like me that are into self care and growth you might be able to relate.

I always held high standards for myself in life and would try and keep to them. Some of it could be stemming from insecurity but I made health and fitness a priority and was disciplined with it. Other than keeping my looks/health up, I also was an advocate of self care/growth/improvement. I also suffer from depression and anxiety so after a breakup at the time I guess you could say I wanted to self medicate and take a break from my more strict yet proactive life.

The issue I found is that weed slowly makes your goals less important. Your discipline slides. Your personal standards start to slip away with excuses. And for people that used to be fairly driven, it can depress them. Once you aren't hitting your personal standards, it makes you down on yourself and depressed.

BUT IT'S OK! Because you then pick up that joint or vape and suddenly you don't care again. It's a downward spiral as the cycle continues and before you know it you hate yourself. I'm all for accepting yourself, but weed gives you a false perception of acceptance. Your personal standards just keep lowering and lowering with complacency, until you don't even know who you are anymore. This makes my depression/anxiety worse, which is the very reason some use cannabis. Funny how that works out. 

None of this is new but figured someone could relate and it would give them some insight as to why weed can slowly hinder people behind the scenes without them realizing it. It took me 2.5 years to realize what I was doing.",62,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6625899}"

I never really had smoked on my own before -- normally just at parties. Didn't touch the stuff in college. I was a total type a goody two shoes with anxiety who overthought everything. 

At 28 I started dating this guy and I tried his vape pen. No more anxiety. Best sex I've ever had -- I could actually escape my brain enough and allow my body to feel. This was what I was missing. 

I bought a vape cartridge off a friend and those happy feelings persisted for about 6 months and then I was always chasing that first high. I could never get it back. I started taking edibles to help while I smoked, that made it feel better. When everyone was getting sick off the vapes in 2019, I stopped for a bit. Only had edibles. It wasn't the same. 

About 2 weeks before the pandemic shutdowns in the U.S.,  I bought some carts again. I thought hey, I'm social, I'm going out, volunteering, working, dating. This will be an occasional treat. 

Yeah... since march I think I've been high every single day of this pandemic. I didn't expect to be trapped at home. I was so grateful to have something on me those first 3 months. But now, the carts don't feel as good so I finally bought the flower as well. Learned how to roll joints. All I've been doing is smoking. 

It was more manageable in the beginning. I was cleaning and cooking and working out and baking bread like everyone else. Then around September I just fell into this pit of depression and over eating. Munchies aside, I also use binge eating as a coping mechanism. I felt disgusting, staying up all night, waking up with a minute left before work started on 3 hours of sleep. I gained weight. I became ashamed of myself, so I stopped talking to my friends. I live alone, no pet, not dating anyone. Definitely don't want to try doing any of that now, even if the pandemic ends tomorrow, because of how I look and feel.  

This weekend I think was at rock bottom. I've been in worse states before, but I just can't do it anymore. I havent met any of my goals since I started smoking. It's been two years. At first it was this safety net for me; a way to shut myself off and cocoon myself from reality whenever I wanted. But now I feel like it is beginning to control me and I need to stop before it gets worse. I havent started smoking during work yet, but I fear I'm getting close.

I'm (F29) about 7 months sober and it has been really hard.

Before that I smoked for about 9 years, in the beginning, it was manageable - or social and I could somewhat get away with in in my lifestyle. But the last 5 years have been really bad and I mean weed just eclipsed all my life. I went through some difficult personal stuff and then just became a hermit, everything revolved around getting high. So this is the hard part that I hope somebody can relate or give me some advice on. I'm turning 30 later on this year and I feel like I have nothing to show for it. The last 5 years feel like a gap when I look back at events that seem they didn't happen that long ago and then realise it was 4 years ago I feel so shocked and paralysed. I don't know where this time went and in it, I made no personal, career growth. Those 5 years revolved around my addiction and a few unhealthy relationships (which sober I probably wouldn't have been able to handle/tolerate). I guess I have to accept to go forwards but I don't know how or how to forgive myself? In a way addiction sometimes feels like a form of abuse, so how I forgive myself for not taking any care of me for these 5 years? How do I accept where I am? I think turning 30 and it being a ‚Äòbig' one is also a big part of the stress. You know I have friends who are having babies or in a good place with their jobs and I feel just like I got frozen in time when I was 25 while there are all these expectations. And the last 7 months coming out of the ice and just being like ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äô. I'm sure the only way for me to go forward is to let go but I just can't, I feel so ashamed. And the other part of it is I guess I thought Id get sober and everything would fix itself but it been difficult and the issues/wounds that caused my addiction to spiral are still there, and that part is still looking for something to latch onto, like my issues with food got worse, and I binge drank a few times. I have been working on it and its definitely not as bad as when I tried to get sober in the past (so much drinking and cocaine) but its definitely still there. ¬†So I feel like I still have to heal and so I get even angrier at myself because the time I spent high didn't even help me heal. I am in a way exactly where I was when I started smoking if not worse.¬†

My social anxiety is bad and I think that's a direct weed-smoking consequence like leaving the house stresses me out, and before I smoked I was quite social, and I struggle with it now. Like I have a list of people and acquaintances I need to reply to, but get so scared and something about developing relationships is really scary. Especially if its people who are somehow connected to my 'old' life (by old I mean everything before I was 25). I still feel like the hermit is there and I think perhaps it's connected to the anxiety and shame I feel about where I am in my life. And this just paralyzes me further. I know I can't go back to smoking and that is not an option and I cant stay paralysed I have to go forward and I just don't know how. I get really ashamed whenever my age comes up because I don't think how old I am reflects how I am if that makes sense? How do I go on being 30 but being 25? And in the meantime time is still passing me and it just feels like I am trying to collect all this sand but it is just slipping.¬†

I hope this makes sense and if anybody who is reading it who is just starting their sobriety journey, I don't want this to put you off. My life has also improved in the last 7 months I can take better care of myself and my loved ones. I can show up in my relationships and have new positive ones. I have become less hedonistic and selfish. So it is worth it. I don't regret quitting and wouldn't want to be where I was when I smoked. ¬†And just because I have this struggle doesn't mean you will.

I am on day 3 as of this morning to not smoking. When I use cannabis its like I feel like my old self its such a strange feeling as when I am sober its like there is no point to doing anything I enjoy. I really wish when I was 16 I wasn't so stupid to listen to my friends and their dumb antics of saying its non addictive and it isn't bad for you. I was not depressed at all before cannabis use, but now after using it for that extended period of time my mind and body just is not right I am in a dark depressive state. Even after 3 days sober I still have that daze high feeling ever since I used cannabis the first time, that should have been the warning to stop but it didn't stop me of course. Its almost as if my life has been on pause ever since I took that first toke. Maybe I am being over dramatic but this is how I feel inside its a terrible feeling. The type of cannabis I smoked regularly is wax concentrate and that was the way I was introduced into it. Regular bud on rare occasions but I would stay to the concentrate because I just hate the smell of burning bud and the smell it would put on me. I fear using the concentrates for such a extended period of time instead of regular lower potency bud is that i will have a screwed up mind the rest of my days. May sound a bit over dramatic but after living in this for a while its not fun anymore to smoke weed its more of a necessity a craving my mind gives me saying you want to smoke you cant enjoy doing this unless you are high as a kite. When I would smoke I would go as hard and as much as I could there was no stop I would smoke a gram of concentrate in about 2 to 3 days. I would smoke until I wouldn't get any higher there was always that point I would get to where I couldn't get higher this started about a year and a half ago, But even though I was not getting higher I would continue to smoke hoping I could climb up more but it never would happen. A few nights ago I had a couple friends over and we smoked and I smoked the most out of everyone and I was the least high there... this is right when I realized I have a problem and I need to stop it before it gets worse if it even can. I lost good friends of mine due to them not wanting to be around me because I smoked weed. It has taken stuff from me that was very important. I of course knew about this my whole time using but it didn't matter cause once I was high there was not a care in the world. Everything I would do I was high I swear in the past year I cant really remember a day where I was not high. I need to get on with my life I cant keep living in this mindset of I need to smoke or I wont enjoy it because that is a really depressing way to live. I really noticed myself change as well during use I am a social disaster now I cant hold a conversation because my mind feels like it is I'm shambles when I talk,  I get severe anxiety around a lot of people making me not want to leave my house to do anything. I really hope quitting this will bring me back to my old mindset. Withdraws have been really kicking my ass I cant stomach anything and I feel really sad inside. I have been drinking lots of water to help with my stomach and eating toast when I can get it down.

I'm a 34 year old male and would have been smoking pretty much every day since my mid 20s so that's 10 years of fairly regular smoking. 

My routine for years would be to smoke every evening once I had time to myself, I live by myself so had no voice of reason there to question what I was doing. I do have a couple of friends that smoke with me watching sports or whatever but the bulk of my smoking was done solo. 

Anyway, a few factors led me to quit the first time. I had gotten a new job which required evening work so I wouldn't be sitting around being idle with nothing to do. The second was actually triggered by a headline in a satirical news website I follow. The headline read: ‚ÄúI Can Give Up Weed Anytime I Want,‚Äù Insists Man Who Can‚Äôt Give Up Weed

The satire article had details about how the fictional man just needed it to get to sleep and that was the only reason he was still smoking. That really spoke to me, it felt like it was written about me. The next thing I thought of was when was the last time I hadn't smoked a joint in the evening? I actually couldn't think of an answer, so I decided to quit cold turkey. 

The first few days were tough, there is no getting around it. Lots of sleepless nights, night sweats, some sever stomach cramps and just severe boredom. But I did manage to get through it and it definitely got easier around the three week mark. Now it I didn't get the amazing burst of energy, or moment of sheer clarity that you hear about in some stories here, but the brain fog was gone and I did feel much less groggy in the mornings so on I went. 

I had gotten to six months of no weed and had no desire to smoke again and then...... lockdown happened in my country last March. It's not really much of an excuse I know, but when we were all told to stay at home, my job could not continue with restrictions. (It still hasn't) So I am sad to say that I relapsed and went right back into the routine again. 

So fast forward to the beginning of January this year. I decided to go off weed once again and here I am at day 15 and feeling ok. The withdrawals have been a bit easier this time, weed up to now hadn't been doing much for me at all, not even helping me sleep so I said to myself what's the point? I don't really want to knock weed, I know plenty of people with anxiety and anger issues that could possibly do with it. But it's doing nothing for me anymore and it's time to move on away from it. 

It's going better this time I think, the past time I just riddled myself with guilt over it and that's what kept me away from it. This time around I'm staying away from weed because I want to. So I guess my message is that anyone looking to go back to it again after being off it is simply don't bother, it'll do very little for you and eventually you'll get back into the routine that you got out of in the first place.

I started smoking at the end of 13 or start of 14, I actually cant remember anymore though I can clearly remember the day it happened. With 16 I built myself a PC and stopped leaving my house to smoke, I just sat in front of it watching Tv shows or anime. Now I'm 18, almost 19, knowing its bad for me, and half of the time I don't even enjoy it, I just feel guilty for all the things I didn't do, but was supposed to or just got ""too"" high and sat there waiting for the high to get weaker, just to be able to enjoy it again.

I smoked my last joint Thursday around 4 am or so, normally I had at max 1 day breaks.It just seemed to happen I had no weed for 2 days when I thought I might just take a break or even stop completely.

I use(d) weed as a coping mechanism for several mental problems I have and built terrible habits like only watching tv shows / anime when I'm high. I even dreamed about smoking last night, I smoked a joint and regretted it directly after. Now I'm here knowing I should just push through the ""hardest"" 10 days or so but my Depression(or the psychological dependence idk) just makes me want to smoke again.

Quitting weed isn‚Äôt a sacrifice. You aren‚Äôt giving up some great thing that is improving your life, or even necessary to your survival at all (unless it‚Äôs for medical reasons, but you‚Äôre probably more recreational if you are reading this).

It‚Äôs not food. You can go a pretty long time without food, but fasting is a real sacrifice. If you run out of body fat and stored food, your body is going to eat your muscles and organs and you‚Äôll die. You may have some spiritual or health reason in mind as to why you would sacrifice food for a time but you can‚Äôt do it forever.

If you fast from weed, you might get bored and emotional, which could be just as mentally challenging to overcome as hunger at first, but you‚Äôll never die from it.

Weed is a privilege and you aren‚Äôt entitled to it like you are to drinking water. You don‚Äôt have to smoke it to live out your life. You don‚Äôt deserve it just because you are alive. You have the option of trading time/money/resources to obtain it but it‚Äôs not mandatory.

If you choose to go without it, it‚Äôs simply a life choice in an attempt to better yourself. You have realized its holding you back from your potential. It‚Äôs slowing you down and making you smaller. It could be a coping mechanism, but we all had to leave binky behind at some point. We moved on to bigger better things. Stop running away from your own boredom.

I want to quit smoking weed so badly! Struggling! Day 4 sober!

&#x200B;

I (26 F) have a long history of mental illness and addiction. I endured a lot of ongoing childhood trauma and have had depression for most of my life, I first recall being depressed at 4 years old. My parents are both addicts. That said, my addictive tendencies began pretty early in life. My first addiction was anorexia at 12 years old, followed by alcohol at 14, and finally weed at 16. (Never tried harder drugs because I just KNEW I would enjoy them too much.) I struggled badly with alcoholism and anorexia at the same time. Eventually I turned to weed, and I thought it was the magical anorexia cure. It made food actually seem desirable and distracted me from the problems I had that caused me to have a control issue and be so fixated on food and calories. It made alcohol less desirable for me, though I will admit I remained addicted to alcohol, I drank A LOT less. I believed weed wasn't addictive and it quickly became my drug of choice.

Last year, at 25 years old, I finally started going to therapy for my trauma, the root of my addiction. I was officially diagnosed with depression for the first time, as well as c-PTSD. At first, I used my diagnoses as validation for my use. Studies indicate that weed helps PTSD symptoms, and may improve or worsen depression. So I thought, ""Oh, that makes sense. My PTSD symptoms *do* feel very dulled when I'm high. Great. This is better than being on addictive psych meds."" And on I went, getting high every day with no guilt because I thought I was helping myself. My therapist helped me understand that I didn't just ""really like weed"", I was self-medicating my mental illnesses.

Now, I'm realizing weed doesn't help my problems like it used to. It doesn't really improve my mood. It doesn't make food appealing on days when I struggle to eat. (I'm sure my fellow anorexics agree that anorexia is a lifetime ongoing battle and even after you recover, it never 100% goes away. It's always there, to some degree). It doesn't really help my PTSD symptoms anymore. My flashbacks of trauma are now intensified when I'm high versus sober. I get flashbacks while sober too, but it's soooo much easier to control myself from spiraling deeper into it. Being high also triggers my anxiety. I'll examine my life deeply when I'm high and feel anxious about everything that I feel is or was ""wrong"" with it.

So I've finally made the decision to quit! My therapist thinks I should get on psych meds, but I am terrified. The last time I was on psych meds, I felt 1000x worse and was actively suicidal. I ended up getting off meds entirely because we never found the right ""fit"". I REALLY REALLY do not want to repeat that experience, as I am **not** currently actively suicidal! I truly do believe weed can be a safer alternative to some psych meds, but I've come to a point in my life where I don't want to be high all the time, especially now that being high has negative effects. I still find myself struggling with the temptation to smoke when I get hung up on my past simply because it's what I've always done. I need a new coping skill.

Fellow mentally ill addicts... What is helping you stay sober? What struggles do you have? What stories do you feel comfortable sharing about how weed has impacted your life? A big part of why I'm sharing this is to feel less alone in my struggles. I know a lot of people can relate that when you're struggling with a mental illness, you feel like you're the only one going through it.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45321143}"

I have made it this far once before. In late 2011 to early 2013 I lived in the Middle East. I was working as a Project Manager, living in a part of that region known for being 'the Vegas of the Middle East'. 

While alcoholism was rampant, marijuana use was (predictably) discouraged. Discouraged in the sense that you would be imprisoned for use, possession, or even having traces on you; and *any* Middle Eastern prison is an undesirable place to be. I had quit weed the few months before my move and didn't consume any during my stay. However, during my two trips back stateside I indulged. 

This particular part of my story is about how weed has been a constant in my life throughout the last decade. How I know that I've been here before. How I know that I must stay vigilant in order to battle addiction overall. How I know that while 69 (nice) days is a great accomplishment, there is so much more to do. How I know that the battle is never truly over, striving for self improvement is never going to end, and that I won't ever be a 'completed work'. 

I'm striving to have better conduct and better character. I know that when I was smoking weed, I was able to keep most things together, but I had no ambition. I had a hair trigger temper, showing my emotions on my sleeve and being an all around basket case. 

Since quitting, I have become more even-keeled, able to 'pay attention to my attention' as mindfulness practice would say. I can step back from my initial emotional reactions, look around, and make a different decision. I'm no longer making excuses for things within my control. Instead of saying, 'it's so hard to quit' I'm understanding that life is hard -- and meant to be. No amount of weed is going to change that. In fact, the easiest way to face this daunting reality is to develop resiliency to meet the challenge head on. 

I've started a personal program of self-improvement. Starting with small things like daily walks, small exercise routines, reading to gain knowledge and skills, and treating my body and mind better. In many ways, I can see a multitude of changes in 69 (nice) days. It's glacial change, but it's change and I'll take it.

I‚Äôd really like some advice and insight into my situation.,"Hello and thank you for taking the time to read this. I honestly have no idea how to start this so I‚Äôm just going to jump right in.

I met my wonderful supportive fianc√© 2 years ago and we have had an amazing relationship and just recently bought a house together. The only problem in our relationship has been my use of weed. She doesn‚Äôt smoke weed and doesn‚Äôt like the fact that I smoke weed. Before I met her I was a heavy daily smoker for 5 years. Her not liking weed and seeing her be successful and happy without weed made me switch on my own to smoking only on weekends. As talks of us having kids started popping up she became adamant that I‚Äôd have to quit smoking weed before we had kids. Now as I said she is very supportive with helping me quit weed and we came up with the very generous plan of 6months of only smoking weekends(fri,sat,Sunday), followed by 6 months of only Saturday and Sunday, followed by 6 months of only one day a weekend. After that I will have to completely quit. As I said I totally feel like this is a very generous plan and she has made me feel really proud of the small victories I‚Äôve had like smoking less on the days I do smoke. Im 4 months into the first six months and I‚Äôm really wanting to quit because she is the love of my life but I feel as though as the quit date becomes closer there is a looming shadow at the end. I‚Äôm afraid to completely cut weed out of my life but I‚Äôm terrified of losing her to something I know is stupid. I just don‚Äôt know how to see life without weed as a good thing. I‚Äôve been in this group for quite awhile now and I‚Äôve heard some powerful stories on here that have really been motivational in the moment but quickly fades when I realize I‚Äôll be without weed at some point. Even only smoking one day a week feels so much easier to except then cutting it out entirely. I‚Äôm scared of what life will be like without weed and I don‚Äôt know how to face the world without a green haze. I feel lame af knowing I have an amazing fianc√© that wants to have kids with me regardless of my flaws and I feel like since I can‚Äôt even make the simple decision of cutting weed out of my life that I‚Äôll be a terrible husband.  I tell myself I want to quit all the time and then I find myself smoking behind her back during the week. I‚Äôve spent so long wanting a healthy relationship with someone I trust and trust me and I fucking smoke behind her back. The betrayal alone makes me sick to my stomach yet here I go every chance I get I‚Äôm smoking again. I tell myself it‚Äôs because I had a hard day or I‚Äôm stressed but fuck all I have to do is talk with my fianc√© and she will make it better yet there is some fucked up part of my brain that tell s me I can‚Äôt be happy without weed. 

Sorry this turned into some kinda weird rant but I guess what I‚Äôm trying to get at in short is how do I see quitting  as something good and not terrible. My mind is treating this like when I quit weed it‚Äôs the end of my life, like I‚Äôll just be miserable the rest of my life without it.

Last two saturday nights were the hardest by far. I mainly only blazed on weekend nights (fri, sat, sun). Never a real desire to be baked during the day. I'm a high functioning user. Have achieved and continue to achieve great things personally and professionally, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm addicted. It only gives more power to the addiction.

I'm sick & tired of:

\- weed hangovers

\- being tired even though slept enough hours

\- mind foggy in the morning

\- sore throats and heavier lungs

\- binge eating while high (disgusting fucking binges)

\- exercise binge to make up for last nights munchie binge which takes time away from friends, family, or other things

\- not being present at outings because I'm subconsciously and consciously craving getting home and lighting up

\- short-term memory not being as good as it should

\- needing weed to sleep

\- not being able to be productive or helpful at night IF NEEDED

\- anxiety while high

\- self-doubt and imposter syndrome while high

What I love about weed sobriety:

\- clear head and mind

\- clear throat and voice

\- less anxiety and stress

\- more confidence

\- saving money and time

\- more enthusiasm to try new things

\- actually reading a book at night sometimes

\- waking up fresh and ready to tackle the day

\- no binges

\- feel healthy

\- better average mood

Blood pressure through the roof (turns out that's an withdrawal symptom nobody told me about), mind racing, barely able to speak coherently, heart pumping at my ears. Ever since, every other day is another (lesser) anxiety attack, always as night falls, generally triggered by the fear that it will happen again.

Hot tea, hot showers, exercise, breathing exercises, meditation, I've tried it all. But hey, I've felt so not-myself lately, at least I've had 0 cravings and lost 10 pounds.

It feels like I‚Äôm finally getting my shit together, went back to college, finally got my drivers license, got a better job, moved to a nicer place, basically achieved more in this last year than I have in the past 15. All those accomplishments make me feel like it was all worth it and I‚Äôm pretty confident that I will never smoke again even though I still think of it and almost relapsed after a rough patch. 

The only downside to my story is that I feel completely lonely. For 15 years I built a circle of friends that i considered very close. I have always been someone with a ton of friends, always surrounded by people. Since I quit, I lost pretty much all of my friends, I simply outgrew them and my priorities changed. I do realize now that they were probably not truly my friends, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt feel extremely alone. 

My city is currently on lockdown and curfew, so it‚Äôs not like I could actually go out and meet people that share my same goals and interests. This leads me to really struggle with staying sober lately. It‚Äôs been really hard on my mental health. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm extremely happy with my decision and proud of how far I‚Äôve come. I know that eventually it will all be worth it and that it‚Äôs for the better. I‚Äôm just wondering if any of you went through something similar and how you were able to deal with it.

When I sit back and look at myself, what I could have been, and what I threw away in the name of a buzz that honestly did nothing but hold me back, my first reaction is to be mad.  I want to be disappointed, feels like I should be.  I would love to go back and make things different, the tail-end of high school maybe reaching out for something like therapy for things like my depression and ADHD instead of barreling down a hole of what I told myself was ‚Äúmedicating‚Äù on a random substance.  But disappointment and self-flagellation only makes you feel small, and when you feel small, you reach for your old fix.

Looking back I realize it‚Äôs my fault I am where I am because all of our actions are our own, but to delude myself into thinking I was born a habitual user of anything is ridiculous.  A bad hand was what I was dealt, but getting to a certain age, having a career that‚Äôs being held back by weed-driven anxiety, a family that needs me to be there and attentive, and just the idea that walking around being foggy all day isn‚Äôt very impressive or productive:  I‚Äôm done.  You get to a certain age and point in life and blaming your childhood for everything starts to feel just as tired as you are.

It‚Äôs my choice now, even if I didn‚Äôt think it was for years and years.  There‚Äôs that thought distortion that made me *feel* like I needed it, the scary thought of being alone in my mind with just my inner voice and endless sobriety, but now that I‚Äôm here I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised it‚Äôs not that bad.  The first few days suck, doing pathetic kind of stuff like going and sitting in your normal smoke spot scrolling on your phone because it feels ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, it reminds me that like all nasty habits, weed is just another obstacle that holds me back and monopolizes my day with its presence.  I even tell myself ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine to sit here for a minute, but **don‚Äôt** smoke.‚Äù  It‚Äôs the most logical approach I could take; it feels like fooling my brain into thinking I'm fulfilling my task is not only fine but is helping me keep it together.

I would plan around having to call people, because weed gives me social anxiety, and I have a career that literally depends on me being on the phone all day and negotiating.  Earlier this week, after having a massive panic attack when I smoked half a joint, that was ***it***.  I realized my life shouldn't revolve around wake up...bake...breakfast...smoke...bathroom...toke...responsibilities?  Nah, too scared, sounds TOO hard, I‚Äôll just play video games and worry about it tomorrow...then tomorrow never comes because the weed just keeps telling you that you want it.  That's been my every day since 2003, only quitting completely 100% for the 9 months of my pregnancy.  Quite honestly, after having my baby I shouldn't have gone back, but peer pressure from friends and family that smoke all day is a bitch, am I right?

I won‚Äôt lie that I‚Äôm a bit scared, uncertain, the idea of quitting and being able to sleep at night gives me anxiety, but what makes me feel more fearful is the idea of getting old, grey, and staying in the same place, turning around and seeing my little girl grown up and realizing that I don‚Äôt remember her life because my foggy memory, that we didn‚Äôt do shit together because mommy was a stoner, seeing all of the missed business and friendship opportunities, and of course, the general disappointment I‚Äôll feel knowing I could have lived to my fullest and *chose* not to.  Weed is done choosing my life for me...it‚Äôs time for *me* to choose *life.*  As afraid as I am for the uncertainty, I accept it knowing it‚Äôs better than the alternative.

I've now realized that most if not all of the issues I have with my life still remain. That being said, I feel SO MUCH better prepared to now tackle these problems because I understand them a lot better now.

Motivation. I'm not nearly as motivated to do active things like cooking, creating, or homework/work as I thought I would be at this point. My motivation has improved, which is great, but not to the point I want it to be at. I now think my lack of motivation is largely in part to my current environment, which luckily I am leaving in 6 months once I graduate college. I'm very much looking forward to that change of pace.

Social skills. My social skills have improved a little, but I still feel a little stuck in my friend group. Quitting weed has helped me realize that I can find friends that better understand me and I get along with better, also that I just enjoy being alone at times and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Again, my upcoming change in environment I think will help a lot with that.

Sweating. Ugh, I still sweat when I shouldn't be. But, I no longer sweat profusely like I used to and it has helped with my confidence emminsely. Hopefully this will continue to improve as well.

Overall, quitting weed hasnt been the radical change I expected it might be, but it has provided me with a deep clarity of my problems and I now see a path forward to fixing them. Even writing this out has helped me get a bearing of where I want to be and how to get there.

I tried smoking for the first time after being completely sober for 6 months and before that 9 years of daily use. The experience was so different from what i remember... It actually made me happy that I've quit and helped push aside any feelings of wanting to try again. 

A couple notes from my experience:

\- It's WAY more intense than you remember. After your body gets cleaned up and you lose your tolerance getting high feels way different than you remember. I took 2 hits from a bong whereas before I could smoke all night long easily. 

\- The two hits made me feel anxious and panicked - not the chill / happy vibes

\- Breathing - I felt like my lungs breathed in a different way when i was high. Like I would hold my breath and then would take really deep breaths to fill the void.. Instead of just breathing consistently (like i do now). I noticed this was happening within the first 45 mins of getting high again, and the interesting thing was when i first quit 6 months ago my breathing was really messed up at first. It was hard to take a deep breath. It was like the inverse this time, it was messed up when i got high this time instead of when i was getting sober. When i woke the next morning my breathing was back to normal though -- another thing that made me happy i don't get high anymore.

\- Tired and groggy later that night & the next morning -- so dazed and out of it, not clear like i have been and easy to navigate what you're doing. Your personality won't shine through like the sober you... I talk a lot more when im clean.

\- Not feeling great for being high and around others (not putting your best self forward) -- feeling like they can tell you're high, but really it's more me feeling a general dissatisfaction with me being high

Anyways, just a couple things I wanted to share with this group. If anything I think i always thought that in the future maybe I'd smoke here or there -- never like how i used to be. This last experience helped me internally feel like I'm completely past it and now don't feel like I'm missing out. 

You'll realize your body was addicted to something you were doing a lot of and you had reduced sensitivity too... Almost guarantee you'll think of it differently and likely in a lesser light if you get clean for a while...

I moved away from my home town to change my life around about 5 years ago and it‚Äôs done wonders for me.

All it does is numb me out and make me feel heavy and gaslight my anxiety. I ended an engagement early this summer which took me to a dark dark depression where I relapsed with hard stuff a few times but have since then been doing better. Took time off for stress leave during Xmas which I‚Äôm still on and got a puppy for an emotional support companion. Now I‚Äôm really trying to quit the weed as it‚Äôs holding me back from living my life, holding me back from loving myself fully, and repressing all my emotions so that I can‚Äôt grasp any consistency in my life and I can‚Äôt get that fire inside of me to stay lit. My friend turned me onto this community, as well as the grounded app. Been doing lots of self help reading and exploring meditation. I‚Äôm just so tired of weed controlling my impulse and keeping me from really getting to know myself.

I quit pain killers about 6 years ago. I said goodbye to alcohol six months ago. My diet is improving. The last bastion of bad coping mechanisms is weed and it's SOMEHOW THE HARDEST.

I have smoked pretty much daily for ten years. When I stop, I get insane depression. That's what kills me and derails my process. I've stopped for a few days here and there but this depression just...well, it kicks my ass. All the coping tools I tend to have are for anxiety... I can handle that.

 soul crushing sadness, general apathy to everything, and absolutely zero desire to do anything.

It makes me this shell of a person and I hate it. But I am determined to meet it head-on and figure it out.

I am new to this site, as well as new to Reddit so I hope I find my way back here. My daughter shared this link with me. Reading the posts brings me to tears and is very encouraging. I have been smoking daily since about 2012. I am 65 years old, have asthma and a cough that keeps getting worse. As I read the posts I realize I continue to smoke, mostly, to keep withdrawals at bay. I have significant PTSD and pot was a kind of magic bullet when triggered, but not so much anymore. I am tired all the time. I am a runner and a hider...running from the discomfort and pain of my life. I am also a warrior and a lover of life, but often find it the hardest to stand for mySelf.

I have done a ton of personal work and actually am in the best place in my life I have ever been, save the smoking behavior. This past year has been very hard...as it has been for the entire population of the world I suppose. Tomorrow I am moving to a house to quarantine, before I move into a new living situation with a small family. And tomorrow is my quit day. I have spent the last year basically hiding in my room alone, since my roommates are not threatened by the Covid virus. I am moving to a farm where the family takes Covid precautions seriously so I hope to feel a new level of personal safety as well as have a small group of people who I can be with, eat with, talk with, which is very exciting to me. At the same time I am leaving everything familiar.

I have been trying to cut back on smoking, but feel quite addicted. I hope that will make the next two weeks a little more comfortable :-) I had monster headaches last time I made a serious attempt to quit.

I would love to connect with this community going into this challenge. I have found little real support to deal with this issue...I talk about it, but no one seems to take it seriously. Even my wise elders believe THC is very helpful for me, and the best medicine choice to deal with my hyperactive nervous system :-)?

you dont need weed for anything. you dont need it for a happy life. its actually the opposite, you must feel the same way cuz u posted here. i lurked this sub for a while before quitting and read posts for the fist 2 weeks of my quitting .generally i feel amazing now. it was a emotional rollercoaster, still is but that makes you stronger, you can change your thinking and thinking patterns , I could too!

everytime weed even pops into my mind (dont really have the urge to smoke anymore even if some friends do when i see them) i just think i dont need it, it doesnt do anything for me, i would just get an awful high thinking why i even smoked, it sets me back achieving anything for the rest of my life!

another thought i use, is ""being high on life itself"" why would i smoke if i will enjoy everything without smoking, maybe even more when weed doesnt fuck my thoughts up? i can be high all the time, using the positive things everyday life has to offer for me, to be high on life itself!

the rest of my life has begun and it will be a million times better without weed. SO WILL YOURS!

This time around is a friggin' doozy though: off and on headaches, bouts of irritability, obnoxiously vivid dreams, lack of interest in anything but netflix and video games (animal crossing is saving me rn), nausea, crying without any obvious rhyme or reason, physical restlessness, going between zero appetite to being absolutely ravenous, insomnia... I knew quitting was going to suck, I just didn't realize how. I thought it would just be the craving aspect. lol NOPE, haven't had many cravings surprisingly, just desperate yearnings to combat the withdrawal symptoms!

In spite of all of this, I am determined to follow through. My partner and I are starting to try for a baby within the next couple months. I hadn't considered quitting weed until last month when our future midwife strongly suggested it. I had always assumed I would use weed to fight morning sickness and pregnancy pains; better than taking pills, right? But after talking with her about it, I realized I care too much about the kiddo to risk any potential adverse effects. I want to be the best mom I can be and give it my all. I know this is the right choice for me and hopefully not too far off baby.

On the plus side, I haven't been craving fast food or sugar like I was before. I started getting into making bomb ass salads. I've increased my water intake to on average 90oz a day (per midwife's recommendation). When I do sleep, I sleep deeper and wake up less often throughout the night. Positive changes are being made, and I need to focus on that!

I have been a daily user of THC and nicotine from morning to sleep for the past 4 years. I worked high and did everything high. Couple days ago i realised that i didn‚Äôt even feel high anymore, i only smoked weed to not feel the withdrawal symptoms and that realisation made me quit. What‚Äôs the point of smoking if all i‚Äôm doing is preventing withdrawal? So then i threw my weed out and decided it was time. First couple days were hard. On day 4, i realised that smoking cigarettes realllly made me feel shitty. Gave me headaches, made me dehydrated. Made my troath hurt. I realised that THC was numbing all the bad symptoms that nicotine and cigarettes gave me. So i took the bold decision to leave that too.

I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll pick up weed again. As soon as i stopped nicotine, all my weed cravings turned to nicotine cravings. I don‚Äôt even miss weed anymore. I used to buy uber eats almost everyday cause i was too lazy to cook. Yesterday i cooked a full meal and prepped some meal for the week. I hadn‚Äôt done that in years. I either ate frozen food or restaurants. 

I feel so much better. I still have the brain fog, but my energy levels are so high. I actually am looking for things to do rather than dreading them. First night i couldnt sleep at all, i think i slept for 2 hours? So the next day i went and bought melatonin and it workd like a charm. I take that 30 minutes before bed and im asleep in less than 30 minutes!

I hope my motivation stays as high, but if it doesn‚Äôt, its okay i will pull trough anyway. I really want to get to at least 3 months free of smoke and weed. That would be awesome. Awesome first goal and then we‚Äôll see what happens.

I had been going downhill for a few weeks if not months with stress from a job I hated and a boss that was disappointed with my performance. Weed became my safe zone at the end of the day where I could escape my fears and problems even for a moment. 

However, smoking high quantities in a short amount of time with very little sleep made my mornings horrible to say the least. 

I used to have a cat at the time (RIP kitty). One morning I said fuck it I am done with this, it is killing me so I threw my stash in the same bag I threw my cat litter. Then I went to the building container and left it next to it since it was full and left for work thinking that I was done with that. 

Once I came back from work from a crappy day I saw the bag looking at me. 

I went to my place and carried on with my evening routine, but the vision of that bag kept on haunting me and the itch for a joint felt like the thirst from walking across the Sahara with no water. 

To my own disappointment, I did the walk of shame and went to pick up the bag from the garbage. I opened it up and while I was fishing for my poison I realized I was no longer in control. That's when it became clear to me that I was an addict. I have never told this to anyone until today.

Like an ambitious goal to achieve wealth or notoriety - I seek sobriety.

Sobriety is my new ideal.

I imagine myself on the road. Even in relapse.

This has been such a powerful mindshift for me that has taken place over the last two months. And it's the reason why I will never be shameful about another relapse, should it happen again.

I no longer seek perfection.

I seek forgiveness.

I seek to love myself again.

I seek the path.

I imagine and embrace that I have chosen a road, a path, toward sobriety and this thought empowers me everyday. This thought empowers me when I am in relapse and allows me to take the pressure of perfection off of myself, because I know that deep-down in my HEART I am striving for this ideal.

I have failed.

But you know what? It's ok now!

I am embracing these failures. I allow for the possibility of struggle.

**I REFUSE** to embrace shame, guilt, and self-criticism.

Nov 29 - Dec 8 - I had 10 days of sobriety.

Dec 27 - January 7 -  I had 11 days of sobriety.

I have been in a period of relapse since Jan 7. And it's OK!! No hard feelings!

Every time I am learning. I'm not being hard on myself anymore. (I refuse!).

I'm allowing it to happen while focusing on **THE PATH**.

Well as I decribed, it's easier. I'm ready again and when I hit the pillow tonight I will have finished 24 sober hours.

So it's not ""Here I go again"" ... No, not anymore. Because I'm *still* on the path and I never got off.

Thank you to everyone who posts here. You're stories and your honesty have taught me so much and continue to make me stronger.

Ive started jogging almost everyday if not every other day. Even 10 minutes. Even 5 minutes of jogging, makes a difference. I started exceptionally slow and got tired after 4 laps at a local park. The next day I did 5. Then 6. Then 8. Yesterday I did 11 laps no problem. And I cant wait to get to 20 by next month. 
Running resets your mental state and just puts you in a calm relaxed place for the next day or two. Helps tremendously with anxiety of withdrawal. Also if you do it in the morning/afternoon, the Vitamin D is like a double boost! Power yourself up and get jogging! Get those buffs!!!!! 
You can do it!!

2021-01-17 17:24:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kzgkgc/choose_yourself/,Choose yourself,"I‚Äôve been lurking on here for a good while now, and whilst I feel like many people have already told my story through their own, I thought I‚Äôd just type out something here to add to the positive nature of this forum. 

I don‚Äôt know about many of you, but I was pretty scared to call it a weed addiction. I‚Äôd consumed a lot of material about how you can‚Äôt be addicted to weed, and whilst this certainly influenced these thoughts, this was also aided by the fact I could go without it if I really needed to. It just didn‚Äôt seem feasible to me that I was addicted, but I guess I was wrong. I would smoke almost every day, not really caring how much I spent on it. I would smoke pretty much as soon as I woke up, sometimes before work. I didn‚Äôt care who knew I smoked, I didn‚Äôt care if they seen me baked, it was just a part of me. 

One of the things I enjoyed about weed was the intense self reflection it brought me. I‚Äôd just chill out, have a bucket or a joint, and reflect on what‚Äôs been going on. I soon realised, though, that I was doing this every night. There wasn‚Äôt much to reflect on other than the fact I was stoned again. This came at a similar time where I was trying to be much more mindful of my actions and who I am as a person. 

Choosing to be mindful of my actions definitely worked, because I realised it was not natural to be taking mind altering substances every day. I had came to the conclusion that whilst drugs are amoral and not inherently bad, my relationship to weed was bad, and it needed changing. So I made the decision that I would stop seeking it out, and if it ever made its way to me, then that would be fine, as I wouldn‚Äôt be seeking it out. A healthy dynamic, right?

Eventually it made its way to me. After a month of not smoking, I got chatting to a group of people on the other side of the world who produced weed out of nowhere, yet none of them could roll (How typical it would find me like this!). Buoyed by my success and my earlier decision, I decided to smoke with them - rollers privileges of course. It hit me like a tonne of bricks as it usually would after a month of not partaking, but I didn‚Äôt feel bad because I hadn‚Äôt procured it. 

When I got home however, it took less and less for weed to find me. My friend‚Äôs, who I knew smoked, would invite me over and I‚Äôd be smoking, and before long I was back buying it to smoke myself again. I thought I had altered my relationship with it, but really it presented much more of a problem than I thought. 

So I started to analyse why I would turn to weed, and the answer was as obvious as you would expect - to chill out. I started to ponder the consequences and implications of using a drug to deal with emotions, such as a stress, anxiety, pressure, sadness, pain, and I realised whilst I was gaining momentary relief from these emotions in the form of a joint, all I was actually doing was kicking that emotion into the long grass, for me to deal with later. The way I‚Äôd deal with it later was the same way I‚Äôd have dealt with it at the time, and so the cycle continued. 

That‚Äôs when I realised it‚Äôs neither here nor there if weed is addictive or not, what was addictive for me was the headspace I was artificially putting myself in by convincing myself I was dealing with my emotions. I had given myself the illusion of control over my emotions, something I cannot control no more than I can control the rate hair grows at. By using weed to after a stressful day, I wasn‚Äôt dealing with what was making me stressful, I was placating myself to a point where I could tolerate that stress for longer. This wasn‚Äôt healthy for my head or soul. My mental health would be down as I‚Äôd constantly be annoyed at being unable to quit, and my emotional health was down as I just ignored everything. I decided to monitor my actions moment by moment, day by day, and I decided to honour my emotions when they appear. Due to this I haven‚Äôt smoked since September, and I don‚Äôt plan on it any time soon either. 

I am fortunate to be where I am today. Life is wonderfully complex, but beautiful still. I don‚Äôt want to miss out on the raw emotions of it any more, no matter how many ups or downs may be in it. I want to feel everything that happens to me, everything inside me, I want to choose myself.",13,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.550845}"

T/W this bit contains relapse details:  
today, however I was with a friend. This particular friend didn't know that I quit smoking or my  (not so healthy) relationship with the plant. I saw that he had a joint already rolled in his pocket and perhaps because I knew he didn't know I quit, I sort of casually asked If i could buy it off him (didn't want to share cos being careful with pandemic) anyway, we walked a bit more and he said sure. I went home and hit a few times a few hours ago. Even when i was going to light it, the lighter didn't work, and then I dropped the joint on the floor. Both moments felt like little warnings from the universe. Regardless I carried on and smoked it. I dont enjoy how I feel, I mean, dont get me wrong, its a familiar sort of numb, but it is genuinely one that I no longer want in my life.   


|All that being said, it is still quite difficult for me to move on from this moment. Already my addict brain is suggesting to me that perhaps I can occasionally just do this, smoke every 21 days... My addict brain is tellling me to give up, to stop this ""quitting""  non-sense and just learn how to be casual about smoking (like non- addicts)  


I know this is not my higher conscious speaking.  I do not want to entertain that devil on my shoulder.

still, I feel a bit weak, and could use some insight as to what you all have said/ done to recover after relapse.  


I am proud of how far I've come, I recognize that relapse is a part of recovery, but still, I need help staying on track.

I started initially smoking weed when I was 15 years of age. I was getting the shit kicked out of me by the 25 year old tough guy!!! who lived next door due to his argument with my older brother. Unfortunately I was not helped in anyway by my brother or father or really the police, although he was eventually charged and convicted that did not stop him from warning me once I hit the age of 18 I would start going out and he would find me!!! Being so young and alone I turned to weed to hide the pain and give me the numbness to even walk home after school. As a result my schooling went to pot (pardon the pun)  having been a good student up until that pony and i started hanging around with the wrong people and staying away from home as much as I could. Eventually I left home but the weed addiction has stuck with me for 30 years! I managed to build a good business and have always been able to hide my addiction very well. The habit was in the last 20 years costing me a minimum of ¬£260 a month. So all in all I‚Äôve worked out that with tobacco and munchies about ¬£90k to ¬£100k over the 30 years. I am married with a son. My wife knew I smoked weed when we met and she smoked a bit and it was great because her dad smoked weed too (an old hippy) so I could even have a joint with my future father in law.  But as the years have gone on my wife and I argue a lot because of my addiction and i‚Äôm depressed. Rightly she knew it was mainly down to the weed. I would smoke heavily after work (saying I was working late) and then go for walks at night, hiding it from my wife using eye drops and gum. I‚Äôve given up weed on numerous occasions over the years but lasted no longer than a few months at the most. Now things have hit rock bottom I  have reflected on my life I realise a lot of my choices I have made have always been with weed in mind.  Even putting my son to bed early so I could go and smoke! How bad is that!!! My marriage is pretty shit to say the least I hope one day that can be fixed but first I must conquer this addiction. I absolutely love and adore my 7 year old son to bits and he‚Äôs my best mate. He has no idea what I get up to and I have been thinking how if anything happened to me it would ruin his life. I am his idol and I worship every little hair on his head partly because I don‚Äôt want to be like my own father. So for my son and also myself, I‚Äôm giving it one last shot. It‚Äôs been 5 days. Lockdown and winter weather is helping me not have huge urges  to go for walks and smokes but when the shit hits the fan which it does from time to time I‚Äôm extremely worried I will be tempted. My dealer has been texting me because undoubtedly I‚Äôm one of his best customers (I‚Äôve now blocked his number) I‚Äôm hoping to get encouragement and strength from others on this site. I know it‚Äôs going to be the hardest thing I will ever do but I am genuinely going to give it my all for my son and me.  I know I simply cannot just have the odd joint, it‚Äôs all or nothing for me.

So now I'm realizing it's just totally not worth it to smoke but still found myself almost caving and smoking just to rid myself of the cramps and nausea and get a decent night of rest. I feel like all these symptoms and feeding off of eachother.

I was with two friends, one who I used to smoke with regularly around the time I first got hooked, another who I couldn't make out and my ex. We smoked a little and they got into my friends car, and I walked around the car to get in on the other side. When I got in I heard my ex say that being high was like torture because it was like she still knew she was sad, but that she no longer knew why. I sat down next to her in the car and said ""ye, when I act like I am empty inside, this is how it its""

&#x200B;

I have been sober for two years now, and haven't dreamt about smoking in a while. Emotionally I am doing a lot better, except for crippling loneliness and self-consciousness, and having this dream I guess surprised me! It's crazy to think about how much time, money and energy was ""wasted"" on getting high and it's good to be on the right track, but man it takes time to heal.

so..hey guys, i don‚Äôt know where to start, but this is my first post on here and first time thinking about actually and truly wanting to get sober. a little backstory for you is that i‚Äôve been smoking since age 15. I am 17, turning 18 this may. i hate who i‚Äôve become. i hate living the life i live. i hate needing something that doesn‚Äôt need me and only wants to hurt me. i hate the way it makes me feel after the peak of the high has worn off. i‚Äôve determined that quitting is my only option. but my mom doesn‚Äôt know, and all my friends smoke, so i‚Äôm honestly all alone in this quitting journey. except for my therapist whom I see once a month. 
how do i do this? i‚Äôve already smoked today, not high rn though, so today i guess is day 0. how do i get through withdrawl... alone.. ? how do i function again? will this hazy dissociated feeling in my brain ever leave? i‚Äôm petrified and alone. i‚Äôm so desperate for sobriety, but it feels like a goal i‚Äôll never obtain. 
i graduated high school early and am in college, i go back for spring semester on tuesday. how will i deal with healing myself during this last semester? i was also diagnosed with derealization at age 15. which i truly believe stemmed from when i took my first dab, when i didn‚Äôt have the tolerance for it, n i spent about a year fixing it. when it went away i forgot weed caused it and still smoked everyday. because i‚Äôve been in online school for the last year and a half, i got school done asap and would spend the rest of the day baked. 
now that i‚Äôm going to be turning 18 soon, i just know it my soul i need to quit. i‚Äôve quit for a few days in the past, but nothing stuck. please just help me. i‚Äôm breaking. i‚Äôm sorry if this is annoying or all over the place i just truly don‚Äôt know what to do and i can‚Äôt live this way anymore. i cant put my all into climbing or school and i hate that i‚Äôve become a slave to a temporary pleasure and a victim of my vices. i wanna learn to live again. please help. thank you for even reading this if you did.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.854002}"

I've gotten so much hope and inspiration from lurking here, I figured I should contribute if I can.

I'm in my mid-50's, single, never married, no kids, well-traveled, software engineer.  Started my 'relationship' with weed at the age of 22.  Went through 4 years of state university without touching the stuff, even tho my roommate pulled out his bong every night after dinner and said ""is tonight going to be the night?""  Me and a neighbor in the dorms were the only ones there not smoking and I felt left out, but didn't want to get addicted.  I met a girl, tho (how many stories start that way?) who smoked and so I picked it up so I could be with her...  we broke up 4 years later, but me and weed never did.

Now here I am 34 years later, smoking only after work and on weekends (morning to night), but pretty much continuously all those years, and only now realizing what an insidious, corruptive influence it's been on my life.  I always considered myself a ""high-functioning stoner"", but now I realize I was just an addict justifying my addiction.

I always knew that weed took me at least 10% off my game, and I told people that, but I also said that it made me happy so it was worth it.  And that I'd rather be happy than productive.  Weed made me think existentially, and I loved that, but it also gave me social anxiety and made me withdraw from friends and family so they ""wouldn't find out"". It also made my work just adequate and killed any attempts of dream-fulfillment.  Now I wonder what I could have accomplished with my life.

It's too late for me to find out now, but maybe my story can convince some of you with so much life left.  It's not worth it.  Please don't waste your life like I did being stoned and stupid and satisfied with the status quo.  See what you're capable of.  That's where you'll find true satisfaction in life.

I saw a documentary once about people with Alzheimer's.  They interviewed a man who, when he went for walks, often couldn't find his way back home and was endangering himself.  The interviewer asked him why he still did it if he knew he could die and he said, ""Life is for the living.""  I think that's how I want to live my life from now on.  Not avoiding boredom and challenges, but by boldly striding outside to face whatever may come my way. 

We only get so many days on this earth and each one of them is precious.  Let's not waste them being wasted.  I'm only 21 days sober so far and I have to say it hasn't been difficult this time like in the past.  Something was switched in my brain, I don't know why.  For some reason I've become aware of the decades that have slipped away from me with nothing to show except a resin-filled bong.  Maybe the difficult part is still to come but, if so, I am ready.  I want to achieve something meaningful with however many days I have left.

Thanks to everyone here for giving me the strength, optimism and inspiration I wouldn't have otherwise.  It's nice to know I'm not alone.

Cheers,

UPDATE:  Thank you everyone! I never expected such a response to my post and am so glad that it may have helped even a single person.  I think I am more optimistic than my story implied, I do have many days/months/years left to work with.  In fact, my grandmother lived to 107!  So if I get that lucky, then I am only half-way to the finish line.  My original goal was sobriety for 21 days and I MADE IT!, so the first stage is done, yay for me!  Will update again on day 42... I know I will make it.  The switch was flipped for some reason.  I ain't going back, I love my increased brain power and am completing daily tasks at an unheard-of rate (for me).",372,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44859728}"

Last night I thought I could try smoking something someone else had since I had gotten over my biggest problem which was the ever-present impulse to pick up whenever I got high, which didn‚Äôt happen during my little moderation attempt. It did NOT go well.

Basically I took one hit from my friends bong at her house which she had only put probably the amount of 2 to 3 dugout oneies in. I used to smoke all day every day for six years and had about 10 days new freshly sober time after my little dalliance, so I thought I could handle one bong hit. I don‚Äôt know what fucked up super weed she got or what the fuck was even going on, because I have never gotten high like that on weed in my entire life, or even on psychedelics. 

Things started OK for like only five minutes, then I couldn‚Äôt talk and dropped out of the conversation. It was my girlfriend and I and my friend and her boyfriend who we had just met, and the conversation seemed fine as I was ‚Äúleaving it‚Äú, but it reached a point where something incredibly strange and terrifying started to happen. It seemed as if their conversation was the stupidest most banal stream of responses and things to say that I had ever heard in my life, it was completely ridiculous and seem to have no substance at all, and I got this terrifying feeling that they were all directly generated from and completely dependent on me, as if the universe was showing me that I created and continually create the situations around me in a 100% matter-of-fact way and that something has gone terribly wrong where everyone‚Äôs intelligence levels had just dropped 70%.

From there I slipped into a state of consciousness I have never experienced in my numerous psychedelic experiences. I don‚Äôt remember much but the distinct feeling of terror that I would never be the same again. I thought I had truly gone mad. Trying to think about things in the traditional way that I was accustomed to was totally impossible, I got no emotional response from any of the things that I loved, was terribly capable of bringing them to mind without having any control over how I felt or any ability to enjoy my situation. I was absolutely convinced that I was gone and would not be able to come back, that from that moment on my life would forever be fucked up and I would operate at this incomprehensible state of consciousness that was at once clearheaded but at the same time lacking in everything that I loved and took for granted about my every day way of thinking. I thought I‚Äôd be in a mental hospital for the rest of my life. I couldn‚Äôt snap out of it or even taste regular thought which is possible in most states of intoxication, so I really thought I had blown it and began to beg to God to bring me back to my previous state. I tried to invoke some of the spiritual practices I‚Äôve been learning for the past three years and the way that they were completely unable to operate from that state of consciousness terrified me beyond words, if these things couldn‚Äôt help me then I had absolutely no idea what was going on and no way of solace or escape.

I threw up in the car on the way home, where I experienced the most existential dread, and after finally getting a little sleep in bed and regaining my hunger because I had barely eaten all day,  I somehow magically regained that feeling of normality. I had been approaching it slowly, and when I had gotten in the car after leaving my friends house the previous night when I was first hit with the feeling that I could possibly be normal again I cried a lot and when my girlfriend asked what was wrong I just said something to the effect of that I was so happy because I never thought that I would feel that again. I have never been that sure of how unchangeably terrible things were and terrified in my entire life. 

Even this morning as I gain the composure to be able to write some thing like this, I am still plagued by thoughts of that terrible conversation, and gripping confusion over altered states of consciousness, which I thought I had a handle on from these other positive drug experiences. The world is stranger than we can suppose, and I hope that I at least learned a lesson from this experience and now know that cannabis can never again be in my life. I tried twice to admit it back in and the way that I always wanted, but this experience has been a loud and clear message that that is not my path. 

I‚Äôd love to talk more about my nearly 4 months of sobriety and all the amazing positive things that came out of it, I‚Äôll just save that for another day. Please just take this as a warning that I know each person must do what they feel is right for them in experimenting with the relationships of these substances, but once you feel they are no longer right for you, listen to that feeling instead of waiting for the slap in the face terror of a message the likes of which I received.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7752647}"

I'm a 20-year-old guy, someone who's always dealt with depression, and as soon as quarantine started almost a year ago, I started to become dependent on weed. I moved in with a friend over the summer, who is a regular smoker and she got me super into it. Sometimes it was fun, it helped me forget about my problems, and always gave me an excuse to just relax and I saw it as an okay way to get through the whole pandemic. However, it made my depression worse in a lot of ways, made me hopelessly unmotivated, and really hurt my communication skills and my memory. I always kind of wanted to stop, but it was so easy to keep going.

However, I came home to Texas for the holidays, where it's not legal, so I haven't had any access to weed. I've been sober for about 4 weeks now -- and thinking a lot about my life and seeing posts on here have made me decide that I want to keep it this way; I don't want to go back to being a regular smoker and I hate the idea of me being dependent on it again. It's been a few weeks of ups and downs, but in general, my head is a lot clearer, I can communicate better, and I'm starting to have more vivid dreams and memories again. I also don't have the constant guilt of smoking when I know it's sort of bad for me.

But I go back to California in a few weeks, and the issue is that 3/4 of my close friends -- who because of covid are literally the only people I see -- are constant smokers. And I mean \*constant\* -- it is pretty much all we do together: for fun, to relax, to party, to eat -- everything. For me and one of my roommates, the girl who got me into it, it's a huge part of our relationship and I have no idea how she'll take this sudden change (I haven't told anyone my intentions). I'm someone who gives in to peer pressure really easily, and I'll pretty much say yes to anything to have a good time or fit in -- it's one of the big reasons I became dependent in the first place. So I have no idea how I'm going to stay strong and keep this hardline stance when almost all of the people I will be around for the next 6 months will be constantly smoking, wake-and-baking, and inviting me to join. I'm extremely worried that I'm going to go back there, have one bad day, and suddenly slip back into my old habits and give in. 

So, does anyone have advice on staying strong when you're surrounded by smokers, and people who may not understand your choice to be sober? I want to keep going down the path of self-betterment, but it hasn't been the easiest few weeks, and I'm worried as soon as I'm hanging out with everyone and they're lighting up, that I just won't be able to help myself and join them.

Ive been smoking daily for about 7-8 years now with no real detriment to my life besides the typical ""lazy stoner"" procrastination and the haze youre left in.  I've been selling not long after I started a way to save money on it for personal use as well as income supplementation.  The last few months have been an ongoing battle of some days I'll wake and bake if I know its gonna be slow at work, or if there's nothing really going on, but for the last month or so I've managed to cut out smoking until I'm off work.  

Recently I've gotten an amazing career opportunity for a company that will move me across the country and set me up fairly well for life so its become crunch time.  Now this last week I've been pushing until just before bedtime as a sleep aide(have had issues falling asleep since I was a kid) and as of today, for the first time in probably 5 years, I've gone over 24 hours without ingesting any cannabis.  

Waking up and being almost immediately alert to whats going on around me, having the energy to perform tasks and complete little projects I have around my house, and the mental clarity I'm experiencing has been amazing and I'm shocked it took me this long to finally say ""fuck it, I'm over it""  

For the last year or so I've been plagued with not being able to wait to go smoke and get high, then I do, and then I just get too high and I sit there consuming YouTube content and very minimally involved tasks.  Akin to ""do the least amount of work to get the bare minimum done"" which was having massive implications on my mental health because my house would be a mess, things are not getting cleaned or put away, etc.  

I'm gonna have a drug test for this job so I have even more of a reason to stop smoking, but after I get it, I'm gonna stay off it as far as I can see.  The will to live, be productive, follow/hold conversations, and retain information far exceeds a temporary moment of pelasure thats immediately followed by anxiety and depression.  I've come to realize being in a perpetual haze just makes me settle for whatevers happening around me instead of taking action to change for the better.  

Last smoke was 1/14/21 at around 23:45.

Weed treated me well for maybe the first two weeks, but afterwards I would just get paranoid and would become silent, and anxious. Then in November I finally made the decision to cut it out of my life cold turkey. And that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been going, cold turkey up until now. I‚Äôm on about day 75 and progress has definitely been made. With that said once I quit the anxiety that I had with weed was amplified and I was terrified of social situations and my brain was cloudy to the point I couldn‚Äôt find words when asked a simple question and I really lost touch with reality. Every one or two weeks since I‚Äôve started feeling more in touch and the anxiety fades. But still I‚Äôm just so confused on why it is taking this long for me. In the past (before smoking daily in June) I was never anxious, never dysphoric, I lived my life excited for the next thing to be thrown my way. And now it‚Äôs really the opposite although it improves. 
Whenever I confide in my friends it‚Äôs really hard to explain, when they haven‚Äôt gone through it themselves...you know? But they say ‚Äúyou should get a therapist‚Äù and stuff like that, and while I‚Äôm not opposed to that type of idea, I am just so so so convinced it‚Äôs not an underlying issue. I used to have underlying issues like anyone, and they took me months to work out. But once I finally did, I felt free, like chains were lifted off me, like the world no longer rested on my shoulders. That was when I gained my confidence, my charisma, everything that makes me, me. It‚Äôs when I discovered who I am as a person. It‚Äôs when I discovered clarity. And that‚Äôs when everyday problems no longer bothered me because I had found validation within myself. Everyone else‚Äôs opinion stopped mattering cause I was content with who I AM. 

Even so I started smoking weed, just out of sheer boredom. As ‚Äúa summer thing‚Äù, like oh I just finished school why not? But I didn‚Äôt turn to weed as a coping mechanism in the least.

But now as I struggle to recover from smoking so much, I wonder if I‚Äôll ever be the person I discovered once again, my authentic self.

Hi all! It's day 45 and I am so grateful for my new sobriety and being part of this sub!!!! 

Here are some notes from my journey so far. Hopefully they can help someone who is struggling right now. 

Relapsing:

It took me months of relapsing to finally get to day 45. I kept getting stuck on day 1, day 3, and day 12. I could not train my brain to stop going to the dispensary. Relapse is part of the process of recovery for a lot of people. Don't beat yourself up!! I was frustrated, but looking back, my journey was just right! You can focus on the progress you're making and the triggers you have been able to overcome so far. New triggers may come up that end in a relapse, but each time you can learn to address triggers until eventually it clicks. Write down your successes. 

Emotional breakdowns:

I felt like it was taking me way longer than it should to feel mentally and emotionally stable. For the first month I was having a meltdown every other day like clockwork... every 36 hours. These were mostly anger & irritability, helplessness & crying, or feeling emotionally paralyzed- like I couldn't do anything but sit in bed. It took about 28 days for these to slowly go away. After 28 days, the meltdowns were every 3 or 4 days... Now I only have these moments about once a week and they are MUCH more manageable. My brain is healing. 

Acceptance and slowly building healthy habits: 

I hear a lot of people talking about picking up healthy habits like eating healthy, exercising, quitting cigs and caffeine. For me, I allowed myself to just focus on 2 things: Be sober and start doing my damn job. I tend to put too much pressure on myself. I let myself accept that for a few weeks, all I can really handle is being sober and working. I dug myself into quite a hole working from home in active addiction, so as long as I am sober and starting to focus a little more on my work each week, I am succeeding. The healthier habits are starting to build slowly now. But personally, I needed to focus on compassion and doing the bare minimum as I healed. 

12 Step meetings:

I started going to 12 step meetings when I got sober. I have attended AA meetings on zoom every day since I quit, as alcohol is just as problematic to me. AA has changed my life. I have a sponsor, new sober friends, and am working the steps. For you it might be MA or NA? Just sharing what has worked for me. I personally couldn't have done it without AA. 

Other tools that have helped me:

-reading this subreddit daily
-daily gratitude list
-daily affirmations
-started therapy
-journaling
-books and audiobooks about recovery and self care (I love audiobooks because the author's voice stays in my head throughout the day, helping me change my own self-destructive narrative) 

Affirmation examples.¬† You can find many online:

I am on a journey. 
I am exactly who I am supposed to be in this moment.¬† 
I am worthy of love and compassion.
My mistakes do not define me.
My productivity does not determine my worth.
I am willing to see love instead of fear. 
Nothing is ""wrong""; this is just real life.

With that new  insecurity achieved, former problems I've had, i threw myself down the rabbit hole that is named weed addiction. 

Smoking pot made me happy, like most of us. Suddenly i wasn't afraid anymore, somewhat less depressed and insecure while high and i loved it. I thought that's it, that's better than alcohol and anything else. I started to gradually increase the intensity of my highs, then the frequency of these and suddenly getting high was my main goal. I ignored everything else as i was either to tired or there was no need to do it - at least that's what my high me told me so. I failed my exams, i mostly didn't even appeared at them as i knew nothing, didn't learnt anything. And the most crazy part about it was that it took me nearly two years to realize what was the cause for my failure. 

I mean, texted out anyone sees it here. ""Yeah, that's the weed"". But i didn't figure it out, searched the cause in my depressions - that became more severe with my ever increasing weed consumption,  in the lack of interest of the subjects - which became less and less interesting with my ever increasing weed consumption and mostly in my procrastination that got a master of science handed out with my ever increasing weed consumption.  I was caught up in my feed back loop, not managing to achieve anything and smoking ever more because of it. 

After roughly one year, i had my clear moment and said to myself that maybe, maybe weed was the cause of my misery. And what did i conclude? That i simply should smoke less. In hindsight i can conclude that it was as smart as a serial killer in jail that tells himself he will kill less once he gets out. Aka, my plan to smoke less was utmost stupid, didn't work out and only took me another year of my life to accept i can't function at all with weed in my system, no matter how little.

And now? I moved out of my students dorm, it helped me so much to stay sober. I finally am free of weed, didn't smoke for roughly 6 months with two small relapses that showed me how much i despise weed and what it makes out of me, my mind and my body. My study isn't going perfect, i'm still not a genius and definitely have to work even more to be the best i can be, but without weed i finally feel able to achieve my goals again and even managed to pass some of my latest exams. I picked up playing the guitar, even tho only a tiny bit i fell unbelievably good about it. I've focused much more on new hobbies, on old friends and on myself without weed that i had to share.   
Weed caused me so much trouble, reinforced already existing ones so much that i now have to work heavily to make up for it.

And now finally i am free of it, can see what it destroyed in my life and have the needed force to get to work of building myself up again.   
I hope you enjoyed the read, i had to tell someone how i felt about weed and how it shaped me. Texting it off my soul felt somewhat important atm. If a fellow struggling student or anyone else may stumble over this post, know that i feel with you, that weed is only a solution to problems it itself creates and reinforces and that you can actually do it whatever you may, and quitting weed is the first step in the right direction but not the last one!",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4751348}"

I have passions that I've been semi acting on throughout this time (not sure if that's due to being drained/stressed from work or weed slowly sedating my aspirations/feelings/making me anxious of failure) but I'm certainly not where I thought/dreamed of being with them when I was young.

My question is, how do you guys reconcile your past abuse/use yet not constantly lament and mourn the lost time? I know the answer is to move forward (""it's never too late to dream a new dream"" and all that) and use that to motivate you to be better and not to fall into similar traps, but my mind always seems to automatically harp back to the fact that I've wasted so much time-- it's all I think about and I just can't seem to let that go.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4967842}"

I went from having one or two ‚Äòspicy roll ups‚Äô in the evenings to help me sleep, to full blown wake & bake every day. 
For the first 2 months I hardly got out of bed in the day time (lockdown meant I couldn‚Äôt see my daughter or look after my granddaughter even though they only live 100 metres away) I was stuck on my iPad, gaming, reading & going down rabbit holes, you know how it is right? 
Once I started to come out of that horrid downer, I made myself get dressed before ‚Äòbaking‚Äô so that I‚Äôd at least DO something. So this turned into, wake, bake, do something useful, bake again etc etc. I loved nothing better than smoking then spending hours in my bedroom like a bloody student, playing games on my iPad. Going down for dinner when hubby called, then back up again. 
I‚Äôve smoked cigs since being a young teenager and weed for the last 20 years or so and during this period my chest is becoming really wheezy and noisy, especially at night when going to sleep. With another grandchild on the way, redundancy on the horizon (& being nearly 60 as my kids love to keep reminding me) I know it‚Äôs time to change my horrid habits. 
I had my last spliff on Saturday so it will be a week tomorrow, have TRIED to have my LAST cigarette 3 times so far but keep begging my son in law for ‚Äòjust a bit of baccy‚Äô so I can have one or two a day. 
So here I am today feeling down, weepy and sorry for myself  (I‚Äôve had 2 [tobacco] roll ups and have enough baccy to have one more tonight) but I‚Äôm really struggling. I know it‚Äôs the right thing to do but it‚Äôs sooooo hard and if I could give my younger self some advice it would be don‚Äôt smoke cigs ever! 
I have so many reasons to stop and none to carry on so why do I feel so bad? I‚Äôll say to myself, right, do your CV, sort out your wardrobe, go for a walk, anything!  But my miserable inner addict says ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to‚Äô so I just end up moping around doing nothing. I did go for a [socially distanced] walk today with my neighbour, then went to my daughters where I cried and cadged the aforementioned baccy from my son in law FFS. 
I‚Äôve got a vaper which kinda helps but nothing beats a real cig or spliff. How long will I be a misery guts? When will I get my spark back? I‚Äôd love to go back to when weed was like drinking for me, just now and again at parties etc instead of a daily habit sucking away my motivation, drive and personality. 
 Please tell me how you beat your demons, how you cope with the misery, what you do with your time. How to fill in those blanks where you just have a smoke before or after whatever. 
FYI I‚Äôm in UK so weed‚Äôs not even legal!

I‚Äôm(M) in my early 30‚Äôs and have smoked all day everyday for 15 years. I still live with my mother and I have not worked in 3 years( got my bachelors degree in a science) I have lost all my friends from my childhood, countless job opportunities, and tons of relationships with amazing girls. Some of it is my own personality but I feel my personality changed from the weed. 

As an adolescent and early teen I was very accomplished. Straight A‚Äôs and very athletic. I played and started in 3 sports my freshman year of HS. By my junior year I was playing 0 sports and was failing school. I began to use more weed to help cope with my depression. I refused help from parents and teachers who recognized my downfall. I didn‚Äôt care. Weed would make it ok. 

This went on thru my 20‚Äôs. Weed consumed my life. Get high before work, on lunch, on my 15 minute breaks and then after. It was 24/7. Weed started to affect my personality and made me do things I never thought I would. It took me 6 years to get my associates degree. At the age of 27 I decided I need to get my bachelors because the jobs I worked were low level and I knew deep down I was so much more. 

As I said before I still live at home and have not worked in 3 years(I did work and go to school for a few semesters but I wanted to get the best out of my education and my parents said they would help me thru it) Some of that is because I focused on my education. I wanted to prove to myself that I can get the grades I used to. I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a science degree  and earned awards for my academic success. Here‚Äôs the thing. Weed helped me study and I used it to cope with my depression and negative feelings towards myself for not working during school. I still didn‚Äôt want to change. 

I have lost countless potential GF‚Äôs because I‚Äôd rather get high. I did not want to deal with the possibility of a break up or infidelity. I have been there and done that and it only made things worse. But now I realize I need to face my fears. Weed was only stunting my emotional growth. 

So here I am. In my early 30‚Äôs looking for a job on my moms couch. The exact person I never wanted to become. When I see people from my past they ask ‚Äú what happened dude.‚Äù I‚Äôm not this person. It is never too late. I need to change. I‚Äôm on day 5 after smoking for 15 years. Flower, edibles, and dabs. You name it I smoked it. I‚Äôve quit my nicotine and kratom addiction as well since going back to school. 

This is the way back for me. I have lost years of my life and wasted talent that I can never get back. But today is the first day of the rest of my life. Today won‚Äôt be as bad as yesterday and tomorrow will be a new beginning. To anyone who sees similarities in my story as yours please consider what I‚Äôve said. I‚Äôm ashamed of what I‚Äôve become but I have fought for years to push thru this struggle. Weed helped me thru some tough times but it also created some. 

Sorry for the novel. This was a long time coming. Good luck to you all. Embrace the pain from withdrawals and realize it‚Äôs making you stronger. This is not us. This was just a blip in the radar for a great, long life with endless amounts of potential. Stay strong. Reach out and ask for help.

Actually kind of a lot of backstory...

I'll be 41 this year. I grew up around weed. My parents are old hippies, I was a stoner musician in high school. I did all of my undergraduate high. In my mid 20s I met my now ex wife, and I knew if I wanted that life I would have to quit. So I did. Didn't smoke for 10+ years except once at a conference out of town.

In 2019 I had a pretty serious midlife crisis. I had an affair. Lost my job. My wife left me and took the kids. Moved in with my folks for a few months to get back on my feet and I started smoking again that fall.

Pretty quickly I was smoking every day. Then quarantine hit and I was furloughed. I started smoking more, sometimes waking up before dawn and getting high because, fuck it, why not.

Met a girl. Also a hippie. Awesome! We smoke herb all the time. Quarantine ended. I accepted a different position. My whole office smokes. One girl hits her pen at her desk and our boss gave us some of his personal home-grown strain for xmas.

But I'm not happy.

I realized a little while ago that weed helps me not feel, and helps insulate me from dealing with the train wreck of my life. I want more out of life, but all I do is work and sit on the couch with an L and play video games. 

And I'm sharper than this, but I feel so dulled all the time. Shit, man. I was a teacher.

I bought a pack of cigarettes yesterday to help myself quit smoking weed. So far it worked, because I didn't smoke yesterday. I quit tobacco twice already, I can go on the patch if I need to in a week or so once I've broken the spell.

2021-01-15 08:48:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kxuuz6/cycling_sleep_aid_for_insomnia/,Cycling sleep Aid for Insomnia,"Hello Guys,

First of all I have to excuse my bad English, as I am not a native speaker.
This is my second time quitting weed, I first smoked when I was 13 and I have been a daily Smoker since I was 16 (I'm 22 now), with 2 month break Summer 2019. Going cold turkey on weed is not that hard for me, besides the Insomnia and the Symptoms related to Insomnia, like lazyness and just being unproductive because I slept like shit.
I'm 6 Days clean now, and slowly starting to get atleast 5-6 hrs sleep everyday. But in the first 3-5 I normally get a total of like 10 hrs sleep, if at all.
For this quit, I decided I had to do something against the Insomnia, because I can't afford to be unproductive, due to university e schooling I have to (and want to) attend. I know sleep aid can make u depend as well, in fact way worse than weed ever could, that's why I decided I need to cycle through different sleep medications for the first 4 Days, and guys, It worked wonders. That's why I wanted to share, because maybe someone can relate to the struggle with insomnia.
For sleep Aid I got
1st day Phenibut 800mg, sleept like stone and woke up in a great mood and was very productive until the evening, when the phenibut wore off and I could feel the withdrawal.
2nd Day 7.5mg Mirtazapin, made me sleep well, but I had crazy dreams, woke up a little bit groggy but felt very rested.
3rd day I took 5mg Zopiclone, absolutely knocked me out for 8hrs, had a little hangover but also felt very rested and even wrote 2 exams and got an A (here in Germany it's 1)
4th day(and last with sleep aid) I took 20mg Pipamperone, slept pretty normal, woke up a bit early  but still better than nothing
5th day First day without sleep Aid, it took me about 1hr to fall asleep, slept like 5 hrs, then woke up for 1 and slept another 2, feeling kinda tired but nothing unbearable.
6th day felt asleep again after like one hour, but slept through for 6hrs and then had to get up, feeling a little tired but still feeling good.

I have to conclude that it helped me very much, because the Insomnia is always what makes me break my quit, because I can't stand being worn out and tired as shit. I have to say, personally, I don't feel very much cravings over the day, but I guess my medication won't help with that if I got them. 
Maybe someone whose worst Problem is the Insomnia as well and who can get access to those meds will find this helpful. I wish u the best luck with quitting, I can't wait until my Body regained its normal state again, I hope as soon as I hit the two weeks mark.
I think I will stay away from weed in the future, because I can't combine it with my life now, the stoner youth is over.",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.45803213}"
2021-01-15 07:51:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kxtxco/i_realised_that_weed_impairs_your_emotional/,I realised that weed impairs your emotional functioning and regulation,"So I didn't think that I was battling with active weed addiction anymore since at least late 2019 (when daily smoking was still a thing for me and had been for the previous 7 or so years). I dramatically cut back and for pretty long periods completely abstained, mostly due to the fights and arguments I would have with my girlfriend (bless her kind and caring soul). I distinctly remember the immense clarity I regained after stopping constant abuse of weed.  

That being said, along with the belief that I was past my addiction to weed, I had continued to hold onto the belief that occasional recreational use was still a possibility. I further justified this for myself by thinking I'd restrict my intake to healthier forms of ingestion, like vaping or edibles.

In the beginning of lockdown last year, I acquired a pretty tremendous amount of homegrown from friends. Since I was already on a journey of quitting vaping nicotine at that time, plus the unfolding of a respiratory disease pandemic before my eyes, I decided smoking was not going to be a good way for me to consume weed. Remember being a weed addict was ""something of the past"" to me at this point. Instead, I resorted to the occasional vape, but mostly went with using edibles. During lockdown I made some infused coconut oil, and enjoyed it on weekends. At first my use was pretty sparse, but it definitely did escalate over time, moreso in dosage than frequency, to the point that I'd be taking doses that made me feel super uncomfortable around my girlfriend and family even. I further justified this to myself because of the novel event of being in lockdown and the anxiety and boredom it brought forth (ha! how naive). I eventually ran out of the coconut oil and never got to making any more, and up until a week or two ago I was still planning to make some more when I had some free time.

It's been a long process of learning and realisation, but it truly hit me today and I realised the right thing for me to do was completely bin the stuff, and detach myself from the idea that having edibles occasionally ""in a recreational"" sense was even viable or a good idea. I felt amazing doing it, albeit slightly anxious (which is so telling!).

This drug has actually caused me a great amount of harm in my life in terms of my emotional functioning and regulation over time, it's pretty shocking to admit. Sure there were some really fun and great times with it, especially in the early days, but I wouldn't wish the negative mark it's left on my emotional health on anybody - it totally has not been worth it. Weed was always a way for me to numb myself from uncomfortable emotions that I had not learned how to healthily cope with. 

I'm excited but a little nervous to continue my path of self improvement in life, because let's face it:

Who truly wants to choose the easy path and disconnect from reality, when you can truly face the complex challenges and beauty of life head on!

EDIT: thank you to every single one of you who have shared your thoughts or feelings towards what I shared, it is so meaningful and gives me energy to see that there are people out there who take life seriously enough to want to live the best version of it!

Then the 31st of december came!!

Last year I lost my job because they wanted to drug test me so I resigned,left the family home in december and seperated from my partner in November who was the love of my life. Losing the main thing that made me happy, which was my family unit. Still through all the heart ache, I kept my promise to my daughter!

Today marks 14 days for me. I had been smoking for 13 years straight, with at least 8-9 years daily usage. I haven't missed a day. No matter what I would make sure I had weed. Now reaching 14 days clean feels like a miracle. Especially with all the heartache I have been going through recently. My sleep has been terrible. I've had nightmares almost every night. I've woke up in cold sweats hourly and I'm falling asleep in the day now aswel. I have a shit load of weed in my cupboard but I'm still resisting 

The 9th of January was my birthday. I met up with the boys( yes, in covid lockdown...sue me) and we played some pool and drank and they smoked. They blew smoke all night and offered me multiple joints, but I resisted. This was previously a nightmare situation for me, but you know what..It wasn't that bad. I sat all night in all the beautiful smelling cali smoke and drank my alcohol with a strange content feeling. It was weird. I could have easily told myself I deserve it as I had cried myself to sleep multiple times in the month prior and hey, its my birthday right?!I have literally had to start my life all over again and doing it without the weed has made it that much harder. But I've done it!

I've started working out regularly and have lost nearly a stone( mostly off my dad gut lol) which I am happy about. I have started applying for jobs and not smoking has opened so many doors for me! I can now literally do any job I want without worrying if I'll be drug tested.  I've applied for an electricians college course an decided to go for the things I neglected as smoker. 

Now I finally feel after 2 weeks I have it under control. I don't think about it all day like I did before and the prospect of becoming an electrician excites me way more then getting high again does. But mostly, I'm happy I have kept the promise i made to my 7 year old daughter. Without her I would have never found the catalyst that was going to kick me into gear and give up this plant that has controlled my life in so many ways. I love my 3 kids to bits and would do anything for them. I look forward to the future being weed free. And look forward to my one  month, 3 month, 6 months and 1 year posts. Remember the name because there is no way i am going to relapse. This stuff did my life no good and I'm happy I have finally realised how detrimental it has been to every aspect of my life.

I haven't ever decided to actually quit before, though I've made some half-hearted ""maybe I'll quit for a while"" kind of attempts. What happened was this: I realized that weed is not my friend... it's a *frenemy.* I once had a close friend who always had a big issue with someone around her. She was a very charismatic person, and it took me a while to realize that since she was the common denominator in all these dramatic scenarios, she was probably the one creating the drama. It occurred to me that if she was always talking badly about her friends, she was likely talking badly about me behind my back, as well. Yet even then, I didn't break up the friendship. Eventually she broke up the friendship when I wouldn't go along with her theories against a mutual friend. The weird thing was how much I missed her initially, even though I knew intellectually that I was better off. BUT my life drastically improved. I was able to have other, better friendships, which she had prevented through her possessiveness and gossip. I was free of the drama and nastiness. And eventually I did stop missing her, completely. Sooooooo I had the realization that weed is exactly like this gal. It seemed like this fun friend, but all the time it's been draining my energy, hurting my lung health, doing who-knows-what to my productivity, causing me to be shifty (hiding it from people) and on and on. When I see it for what it is for me ‚Äì a sneaky backstabbing frenemy ‚Äì I'm not tempted by it. I think about how much better my life became without that draining, negative force that seemed friendly and fun but was secretly dragging me down and messing up my reputation and future.

Start new habits. You have to replace time stoned with something else.

Have patience and your mental sharpness will come back. It‚Äôs worth it. You will also feel more emotions and learn to deal with them without a crutch. This will make you more stable and capable when making your way in the world.

Replace it with something if you have to- for me some things which have thwarted cravings are sparkling water, candy, and chewing gum. Working out is another good one.

 I wanted to share because 90% of the people in my life have no idea I‚Äôm a stoner so no one really knows what I‚Äôm going through and I felt like this would be a really good place to vent!
I‚Äôve smoked on and off for the past 10 years. I smoked daily for the first 8 years and then had a year off (not by choice). I would mostly always smoke alone so it‚Äôs a personal thing. At my worst I‚Äôd smoke before, during and after work even though I have a really good professional job and I even smoked before playing football at weekends because I convinced myself I played better stoned. 
The year I had off my mental state was amazing and I felt like I could do anything. I was consistently going to the gym, put on some decent size and everyone complimented me on how great I looked and how my whole demeanour was just full of confidence and positivity. 
Then I let my guard down and decided to have a smoke with a friend for old times sake and it slowly snowballed into a daily thing again. 
Over the last 18 months I‚Äôve pretty much smoked daily, with a few failed attempts to quit in between, and slowly my self worth has just completely gone. In the present moment when you decide to smoke you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to do any harm, in fact it feels like the perfect remedy for a stressful day, a long week or any other excuse you can think of, but It‚Äôs amazing how it gradually chips away at you day by day. You only start to realise after a few months when it‚Äôs too late and the bad habits have reformed and then you just feel trapped again. I had lost 2 stone and all my muscle because I could never be bothered to eat properly aside from the odd munchies on junk when high. I live with parents so every time I‚Äôd go for a smoke and came back into the house it was pure paranoia in case I stunk of weed which resulted in going to the bathroom spraying myself, brushing teeth and using eye drops to clear the red eye. I was getting up late for work every morning because I physically could not pull myself out of bed until it was already too late. The list goes on and on but in general I‚Äôve just felt completely unmotivated to do anything and yet at the same time I have so much ambition and want to be so successful in life. It‚Äôs literally like having two opposing voices in your head and the one that always comes out on top is the one that doesn‚Äôt have my best interests in mind.
I made the decision to quit 4 days ago and it‚Äôs pretty tough at the moment with the lack of sleep, constant sweats and constant irritability. Nobody knows I‚Äôm going through this at the moment. 
I‚Äôm definitely going to stick it out this time because I know if I continue down the path of a stoner I‚Äôm just basically accepting a mediocre life and being someone who‚Äôs never going to fulfill their potential. 
The thing that drives me is this weird feeling that if I live a sober life then so much good is going to happen as a result, maybe not tomorrow, next week or next month but Im convinced it will come! It‚Äôs hard to have a clear focus when your head is so foggy but it will pass and hopefully the results will speak for themselves and I can get back to being who I was before I started back down this road again.

This neurosis last all night till morning. Then i decided to stop definitely.

2021-01-14 16:45:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kxfkxb/hitting_a_new_low/,Hitting a new low,"Right now I am feeling alot of anxiety because rather than working on the project I should be working on for my job, I have been smoking weed and watching videos.  I deal with this anxiety by smoking more weed.  I am currently working from home.

I know that I have to be sober to complete any work, otherwise I have no concentration or memory abilities.  I make plans every night of what I will do the next day that will help me to stay sober, but every morning I sleep in and somehow convince myself that I should smoke a joint to get myself going.  It ruins the rest of my day every time, yet I still do it.  Even if I was having panic attacks from withdrawal, I would still be able to get more work done, but I can not make it even to that point.

Out of all of the substances I have gotten into in the past, this is the only one that affects me to this level.  Alcohol, I never got into all that much.  Crack, it was more of a fling, and I ended up feeling that the culture around it was extremely annoying and way too serious.  Cigarettes on the other hand was more comparable to this.  Those took me about 15 years of trying to quit before I did it.  Even then, if cigarettes were threatening my job and mental health as much as this, they would have been alot easier to stop.

This makes me feel like I am a pathetic person, that the real reason I fail so much has nothing to do with weed, but that I am just a very weak person with no ability to develop thier own power.  Even when I managed to quit for several years before, and was much more productive, I still managed to make a horrible mess of my life.  I still found all sorts of ways to waste all of my time and create pain for myself.  Maybe that is what I am really addicted to, wasting time and feeling anxiety and depression.

I notice that the times that I am able to quit for any length, I have some kind of support system from other people.  This could be meetings, councilling, or trying to find some positive community.  It works for awhile but every time, I will end up getting mad about something and harboring some kind of resentment towards them.  At some point I just stop engaging with them and try to go my own way.  Doesn't take too long after that before I am back to being high everyday, and soon after that, my healthy habits have deteriorated.  I eventually end up here, where all of my activities are based on short term rewards, and I feel like I am having a 24/7 anxiety  attack.

I feel like I have so much to offer the world.  I have and have always lacked something to be able to do anything about it though.  I don't understand how to get over this thing that is always in the way.  I don't even understand what it is.  It is extremely frustrating for me to see all the years go by, and it really is because of my own actions.  

It is easy to see all of this right now, because I am high, but when I sober up I will somehow convince myself that a joint gives me energy.  When I am desperate, reaching out to people seems like the best idea, but after being sober for awhile, I stop trusting thier judgement.  Sometimes, really shouldn't trust thier judgement, but other times I am probably just making it all up in my head.

I am just feeling really paralyzed on the outside, complete panic attack on the inside right now.  I ended up calling the suicide hotline today, and just being able to talk helped me trace back some of the things I have to deal with.  I wanted to write all this stuff out to help process it a little more, and knowing that other people will read it is somehow comforting.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82079184}"

A lot has happened in these two weeks. It started with my having a psychotic panic attack because I took way, way, waaaay too much of an edible. It was very traumatizing and I don't remember the next few days after that experience. It took about a week and a half to move on from it. Now, after 2 weeks, I'm only beginning to feel like my normal self again. 

Some good news, I finally went to the doctor to get help. It's been a very hard year for me and I sort of realized that a lot of these issues I am dealing with today arose early on in my life that I was able to ignore. I am being screened for ADD and depression, no diagnosis have been made yet but it seems likely that I will be diagnosed with those. I have a follow up on Friday.

I was feeling so good this week. Last week was hard but I felt like I was on the other side of it, I felt amazing monday and Tuesday but it started going downhill fast tuesday night. I started having heart palpations and was getting really lightheaded and feeling like I was about to pass out. I was also shaking uncontrollably.

Today, it got way worse so I called our local health line for advice and the nurse suggested I go to ER immediately. After several hours and tests, the doctor came in and told me everything was clear and that I was experiencing anxiety and have essentially been having an anxiety attack for the past few days. I have always had anxiety and used weed to cope, but this doesn't feel the same. I can always pinpoint what is causing my panick but right now everything is fine, aside from quitting, I have less stress than I probably ever have. Work is good, personal relationships are good, I can't think of anything that would cause this.

Now, I'm home from the hospital and I feel so god damn stupid. I worried people I love for nothing, I worried my boss for nothing (and now have to tell her whats going on). I feel like I wasted the doctor and nurses time and took resources away from people who actually need medical attention. My dog is even looking at me funny and I feel awful for freaking her out too.

I haven't stopped shaking, sweating or having the light headedness and heart palpations, but I know it won't go away now that I have this horrible guilt. 

I feel so fucking lost and I'm thinking Is this even worth it? I feel like I was better off when I was numb, or at least I could get through the day without being such an inconvenience for everyone around me.

I think driving 3700 miles took my attention away from the cravings, the night sweats and other withdrawal symptoms as I guess I was too tired at nights. Have been sober for 3 weeks.

Lack of motivation was my biggest driving force in quitting.

Weed is not the only addiction that haunts me. It's also caffeine, nicotine, sick pornography addiction, and in the past I've experimented with hard drugs like heroin, speed, etc. and

got a nasty addiction to stimulant pills and this nasty very addictive otc drug that as horrible as it is, has a subreddit on here that I found out about. I usually took it once a week but the tolls it took on me started getting devastating on the mental aspect. It was like taking mdma every week. I haven't taken any for a month but everyday still check to see if it's in stock and know i would've relapsed had it been re-stocked by now.

I've just reached a point where I don't know anymore.

I make so many attempts a week to quit it's not even funny. I go so many days of wanting to quit so bad and I still continue anyways.

I'm starting to feel like I'm just a slave. That I'm going to have to exist in misery the rest of my life like this or just be dead.

Somehow it seems impossible to quit.

God man I've litterally been wanting to quit smoking for 6 F\*CKING YEARS!!!! How can everybody else simply do it and I CAN'T!?!?!?!? Why is everything unfair for me and it just seems that I struggle with letting go of my addictions 10 TIMES more than other people.

I don't know what to do...

I've always had hope that I'm going to quit and be 100% sober one day from all these drugs and weed. But it's starting to look like, ""What's the point of hope if I can never get myself to change anyways?""

As I type this here I am with my joint and my cup of coffee. On my way to work I plan on buying another vape because I cannot make it through the day without nicotine. I threw away my vape last night, now regretting it.

When you combine that with my struggles with mental health, I'm a miserable addicted sh\*t-feeling person right now with absolutely no joyful feelings in their brain.

I'm tired of watching other people exist for a purpose and to be existing to enjoy life and make memories. While I exist everyday solely to just experience pain, despair, and torture in my head.

Wish I could be like everybody else and quit... nobody understands me. It just seems like I'm different.

How did I succeed and make lasting change to my life? It was all related to psychology. I knew from attempts over the last couple of decades that it wouldn't be easy. What was holding me back was fear. There was a lot to ""fear"" - or so I thought. The fear of carrying on in life without this crutch that I had become accustomed to. The fear of going through withdrawal. The fear of having to change my life in a manner large enough to accommodate reaching my goal of quitting. The fear of the unknown. At some point in June, with a lot of introspection, I accepted facing those fears. I was 40, I assumed I would be free of weed by that age and my past failed attempts were getting the better of me. I *had* to change. I resigned to the fact that I was going to have to incorporate significant changes in my life to achieve being weed free. I accepted that it was really going to suck for a while, likely many months, until I got through the withdrawals and adaptation. I accepted that I would have to learn new coping skills and strategies to deal with life and the ups and downs that it brings. I took it day by day. Eventually days turned into weeks and weeks into months and I began to notice major improvements. Here at the 7 month mark things are much better. I'm back to being quite functional again. My goals in life are shifting and aligning to what I really want and my perception is no longer clouded by my constant use of weed. It feels good, I'm happier and more confident than I've been in a very long time and finally more sure about myself and what I want from life and my abilities to make it happen.",35,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.564771}"

I smoked over 6 years daily.. I was stoned at work, I was stoned outside. I just was stoned every damn minute of the last years.

I was sober for over 6 months but I smoked again, I thought I missed the feeling of being high. So I smoked again every day, I was high every minute again.. It was such a waste of money. With corona I tried to limit it but it doesn't work. I got high every day.

So I thought it would be better to move to another city without the connections. I moved to another city in June last year. But I couldn't stop smoking, I traveled to my old town every month - just to buy weed. It's illegal here, every time I was super paranoid that the police catches me. Not happen.

Now I'm sober since 3 months again. Sometimes I think I wanna get high again but I remember the last time I smoked. I thought I would die. I felt super uncomfortable, more as the withdrawals could make me feel. Still have the connections in my old town but I don't want to buy stuff. I like to save my money to buy me things I like. Things that will last longer than weed. Like new clothes, new video games or just new things for my cats xD

Sometimes I'm super sad about the things I left behind. Like old friendships (stoner friendships..) or just the first time of beeing high (I know it's impossible to get this feeling again)

After moving to the new city I got a better job, better apartment and I rebuild the relationship with my father and stepmother. I ride my bicycle a lot. Go swimming (atm it's not possible cause of the lockdown here) etc.

I'm thankful for my dealer, he said things I needed to hear. Like we just try to catch this old feeling of getting high and it's not worth to feel that bad after smoking. He quitted too.

I hope I stay sober now. There are a lot triggers outside. Smelling it, people talk about it, etc. But I want to stay sober. I hate being high.",4,"{'rona': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50233865}"

Although being sober, I realized that every time I couldn't get my fix I would be worried about my future. Now that I'm sober for more than a day, it's really taking effect.

I finally admitted to myself that I am scared to not know what will happen and used weed to hide this fear.

I'm in my last semester of college for graphic design and although I *was* very excited to see what comes next after school (while I was high and fantasizing about what my life could be like), now all I can think about is what my plan is if my career in design doesn't work out.

I will NOT go back to smoking weed because although it helped me feel optimistic about the future, I never actually did anything to work on creating that future for myself. Now that I'm sober, okay great, I can work hard in the competitive graphic design industry to try and make something of myself, but hard work doesn't guarantee a job. I don't even know if graphic design is something I'm even passionate enough about to dive headfirst into.

Now I feel like shit about my decision to pursue design because I only pursued it in the first place to make cool-looking stuff. This feeling of regret based on my decisions hit me like a fucking brick wall after smoking almost every day for 4 years.

I know I shouldn't be worried about the future because it's totally useless as I will never really know what will happen, but I just can't. I'm surrounded by miserable people who hate their jobs and I'd hate to become that.

I'm also aware this probably has to do more with my own self than my addiction, but I thought I'd vent here to see if anyone else can relate while trying to quit as well. This also seems like a great community. I see myself in a lot of the posts you guys make and would love to find people to talk to about figuring your life out after you put in on pause through the constant use of cannabis.

Quitting alcohol and weed both is super good! I already lost 3kgs and getting in my old athletic shape, missed that. Doing yoga everyday and practice mindfulness for 5 days now.

At least 5 years as a daily toker, sooo many attempted quits beforehand, and following my worst addiction to weed at the start of the shutdown, i finally found the self reflection I truly needed to actually quit. 

I mostly stopped for two weeks in early November. Taking a puff of my vape pen before feeling immensely anxious over what as a turbulent and stressful time in my personal life, hoping that the high would take my mind off of it when it really just made me focus more on self judgement that I couldn't deal with my problems. Eventually I stopped those single puff nightmares, started to accept my bad feelings instead of trying to run away from them. It also helped that I am an avid journaler and was simultaneously reading through my journals from the past few years to help myself with the aforementioned stress. How many times did i see myself write, ""I'm QUITTING after tonight!"" or, ""I haven't smoked in days, i finally feel like myself!"" Reading that soberly was really shocking, sometimes it was like I was living in Groundhog Day in terms of one entry saying the same promise right after the other, and both bemoaning how weird i felt because I was presently too high. Weed hadn't been fun for me in so long, but i wanted to ignore it because it helped me ignore other things that also weren't serving me.

On Thanksgiving, in a depressive episode, being sad that i couldn't see my family and upset about my current living situation, i decided to get high. Not out of my mind high, just a ""good"" few puffs from my vape pen. I got high and immediately had an anxiety attack and ended up laying in bed for three hours despondently. Weed shouldn't feel like that. I knew it wasn't a question of taking some distance with a tolerance break, it just gives me anxiety now, it's done for me.

So I haven't smoked since that day, 47 days ago. The last time i went a month without smoking was four years ago. This is the longest I've gone without smoking since I started. 

I had some cravings, even after that last anxiety attack, but even worse is i experienced some bad depressive episodes that i wanted to smoke away towards the beginning. But i didn't. I had thrown out all of my weed paraphernalia on Thanksgiving and I remember how i felt on that day and all of the little puffs in that preceding quitting period. I remember all of the horrible anxiety attacks i had both high and sober when so much of those personal problems were starting in the preceding month before i quit. I remember how impossible my job felt back then, how i spent so much time thinking about how others think of me.

Now, i still get anxious from time to time, still fall depressed in bad situations, i still have problems and interpersonal drama. But i feel better equipped to respond to all of it instead of react to it in a way that stresses me out in the long run. Still feel miserable at my job, but now i know i am doing it and doing it well, in the very least.

It feels good to have this space between myself and my emotions. This time to observe rather than merely push away and drown out with substance. Sometimes I still muse on how much yummier my food may be if I were high, and other times I delight in how good it tastes when I can actually stop and savor my food.

I recommend trying to quit and stay sober. It took me so many fucking tries to get to this place. It's worth failing again and again to finally get to a stable place.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5742842}"

For a really long time I used weed to suppress my depression and anxiety, but it was actually fueling my eating disorder at the same time. I would smoke and then binge and then purge. I knew it was unhealthy but I didn‚Äôt realize how much the ED was consuming my thoughts until I stopped smoking weed (the weed would help me forget about how fucked up my eating habits were). The weed would often distract me from my reality but at the same time the weed would also cause me panic attacks because sometimes I would feel so fatigued from malnourishment and then would start thinking that I was going to die. Or I would begin overthinking how my eating disorder was actually very much a part of my life and start freaking out and trembling etc. Anyways, now I‚Äôm a few weeks sober from weed, which I‚Äôm actually really proud of, but I‚Äôm starting to realize that weed was never the root issue for me- it was the eating disorder that I was in denial of suffering from. So now that I have had this realization, part of me kinda of misses smoking weed. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm craving it throughout the day, just at night when the thoughts about my ED arise. It really would help me sleep most nights. I have been having dreams about breaking my weeks long streak without weed, which is also kind of weird cause I never used to dream about weed like that. Anyways, I‚Äôm gonna try to continue life without weed for now because I know it will only hinder my path to recovery and keep me in denial. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm wondering if anyone can relate to anything I said. 

Also, for anyone who really wants to stop smoking/ is in the early stages of not smoking weed - you can do it. Never in my life did I think I would make it this far, but I have, and regardless of my struggles, that is something I‚Äôm proud of nonetheless.

I don't have any cravings, my head feels clearer and I'm determined to keep it that way. Yet I still feel like shit.

My girlfriend dumped me just after Christmas because she hated my lifestyle and refused to be with me while I would hide my weed usage from her, losing hours mindlessly playing video games or scrolling through social media and not being present. That hurt me. A lot. So I came to the realisation that I needed to make a change in my life. Not just because of her, but for my own sake. Nearly all of the problems in my life can be attributed to that harmless little plant, so it has to go. 

I've been reading a lot of articles online about how to deal with a break up, and they all seem to share one piece of advice - throw yourself into hobbies or activities that you enjoy or may not have had the time to do before. This made me stop and think. Having been a daily smoker for so long, what were my hobbies? Getting high and playing video games. Getting high and watching sports. Getting high and watching porn. Getting high and partying with my friends. Not exactly hobbies or activities that are conducive to the healthier lifestyle that I now want to lead. I can't stop thinking about the South Park quote; ""Pot makes you feel fine with being bored. And it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.""

I can't get those words out of my head, because now more than ever they feel true for me. I'm 29 and I've used weed as an escape from being bored through my entire 20's and as a result I have no real hobbies. Every time I've attempted to start something that could be considered a hobby in the past, I've given it up shortly afterward because of a lack of interest or because it seemed too difficult. I'm committed to becoming the best version of myself this year but I'm not sure I can do that without finding some sort of drug and alcohol free activity to occupy my time.

The withdrawals haven‚Äôt been bad at all since quitting (and since I started exercising daily), aside from the occasional dry heaving and the almost daily vivid dreams. Mine have ranged from mildly odd to extremely disturbing, and often include layered dreams like in Inception. I wanted to make this post to discuss and share how people have dealt with the crazy dreams after quitting and also telling us their craziest dreams if anyone would like to share. 

The way I‚Äôve been coping with them is grounding myself after waking up. I do this by writing/typing my dreams in my journal if I feel they have any significance to me, and allowing myself several minutes to sit in the present, and process/transition the emotions I felt in the dreams to the emotions I want to feel in the present. So meditation basically but  more focused on transitioning myself from dream to reality.

I would like to start by thanking you all for putting some sense into me and helping me realise that weed has been a piece of driftwood that I should forget about and not a healthy branch of a tree as it was when I first started using it to cope with trauma.

Since I stopped buying it I have rolled one joint out of kief which was everything I had gathered from grinders, bags etcetera. This was on day 3 if I remember correctly. I do not consider smoking that relapsing because the dosage was significantly smaller than my """"""usual"""""" joints and I had absolutely no intention to seek more. 

I had many of the symptoms associated with withdrawal and still do to some extent, except for insomnia. My body has been CRAVING the hell out of that good, processing REM sleep and I felt so stupid for not realising how important it was to my physical and mental health. Up until today I was dealing with excessive anger and it only made it harder to work since I cannot possibly take it out on my lovely colleagues. 

Last night I had decided to stop smoking cigarettes after seeing that one pack of smokes were done. Had I eaten them? Did I even crave them that much? It made me question my habits and if I was replacing my needs with smoking and delaying. So today I borrowed a smoke from my colleague and bought a vape kit since I had not planned on quitting cold turkey to make sure I wouldn't be a distasteful bitch to work and live with. After letting the vape pen be ready I was already not so into it anymore.

To my surprise, buying a cheap vape kind of turned me off to the idea of ""hitting"" or ""ripping"" on the thing. I knew I wouldn't go back to tobacco or assemble one of those vapes that remind me more of portable hookahs rather than your usual cancer sticks. I feel like quitting weed gave me this resilience but still, it was a quite pleasant surprise.

I rapidly start experiencing all the withdrawal symptoms. I quit 3 days ago in an attempt to get my life back. However, i'm especially struggling with the following symptoms. First, the inability to eat, I have eaten only 1 meal since quitting. This is extremely frustrating since i am hungry, but unable to eat and completely out of energy to do anything, even to make food when i feel i can eat. This resulted in a 2kg weight loss in 3 days. As a skinny guy, this is also frustrating. Second, irritability, after quitting i got into a fight with my mother. I used to be able handle her temper and provocation, but i couldn't. I felt my head boiling. I shouted back, stormed out, started punching walls and breaking things to ease my anger a bit. This resulted in a sprained wrist, bloody knuckles, and some lost furnitureüòÇ. What's frustrating is that i know and feel that i was emotionally unstable, but i just couldn't stop being angry. Also, the guilt associated with upsetting loved ones is extremely draining. Last, insomnia. just frustrating. However, i am still willing to fight my way to soberness.

I don't feel like I am battling just 'one more spliff' mentality, I feel like the war between two lifestyles is being had, and I need to continue put in the hard to work to commit to a sober life. The general waves of life hitting you in the face repeatedly that can be escaped by weed, where that can be your focus, your addiction, your most important part of the day is no longer the case, and you long for that to be the most important problem again because real life and real problems can suck ass sometimes. I know I want to push through, and keep on this path I've started out to build a better life for myself and not cop out and go back to smoking and that limited lifestyle it creates. The argument of 'just one' doesn't even appeal/work because I know things will be the same again tomorrow if I did and it makes no difference/doesnt move things along. I guess I just haven't fully appreciated how much hard work life can be sometimes, especially when things aren't really going your way, but that's never a justifiable reason to go back to smoking weed every day and end all the hard work that's gone in until now. 

I just feel a little bit like I am relearning every thing atm, about the world, about myself, about everything that has happened in my life at the moment, I've had much longer sober periods than this, but knowing I have to commit to staying sober forever put a new clarity on things for me I guess.

I think my current lesson is the challenges of sobriety change over time. It's easier in a lot of ways, like the impulse control to keep on top of it has gone up massively that it makes day to day living a lot easier, but the new challenges seem a bit 'bigger', like there is more riding on it not fucking things up the more days sober I have.

I can certainly say after 64 days that cannabis needs me, but I don't need it. I won't feed it my time, efforts, and energy anymore.   


I've struggled with addiction in various forms throughout my twenties and into my thirties. The constant throughout it all has been weed. Emotions have always been overwhelming for me, and instead of confronting those feelings and building skills to deal with them, I've used substances (the longest running was weed) to cover those feelings up. You have to pay the piper at some point, and the longer you wait, the bigger the debt. 

Here's a quick summary, hopefully it will help others find and stay on the path. 

Drinking: Instead of building the resilience and skill set to deal with my overwhelming feelings, I decided to drink instead. After developing a habit of a bottle of wine and/or a six pack of tall boys per night, I quit. The impact it is having on my personal life and my productivity was unacceptable. Been sober for six years now.

Nicotine: Unfortunately this one was the worst in terms of health damage. I smoked for the better part of a decade and finally quit 3 years ago. It was tough to kick, but I was able to remember that nicotine is only in your system for 3 days. The rest is just a mind game. 

Cannabis: Of the two things already mentioned, this was the least impactful short-term. What I didn‚Äôt realize is the long-term effects of having little ambition, and an addictive personality. It got to the point where I was smoking a couple grams a day in order to just feel normal. 

Over the years I've quit (for up to 1 year at a point) but always found myself back at it. As is common, I even had it down to 'only on weekends'. Even then, I would binge on junk food, stay up late, and not be present with my family when I needed to be. 

My rock bottom was realizing that through being not present and high most of the time, coupled with the stress of COVID and life, I had allowed myself to become complacent and taken my family for granted. I'm working on gaining forgiveness from them for this now, and I am thankful I finally quit in order to confront and deal with that harsh reality. 

I've quit and have been sober for 64 days now. I used weed for about a decade to try and cover up my feelings and become complacent. I wasn't losing jobs or anything, quite the opposite. I was becoming pretty successful and moving up in my career. But I wasn't at my full potential. 

The Sober App I use says the following:

*I want to be at my full potential. Marijuana negatively impacts my ADHD symptoms and exacerbates attention and executive function issues. I want to be a better husband, father, and leader.* 

*Being a leader requires discipline and resilience. I place no value on those things when I'm high all the time.* 

*""Get up. Dust off. Reload. Recalibrate. Reengage. And go out on the attack."" - Jocko Willink*

Now: Through a combination of personal therapy, getting medicated for ADHD, reading and consuming leadership books and podcasts, I‚Äôm in a pretty good place right now. Or at least, a place where I‚Äôm ready to deal with my feelings as they come at me.

Life isn‚Äôt going to stop. It‚Äôs like that movie Airplane!, where the dude says, ‚ÄúI picked a hell of a day to stop...[using random drug]‚Äù. The reality is, it‚Äôs not going to stop. It doesn‚Äôt really matter when you decide to quit and confront your feelings, you‚Äôre going to have to at some point. Life doesn't stop and doesn't care that you need to take it easy since you're having a hard time. 

I‚Äôm 34 and wished I would‚Äôve done it a decade ago. No regrets though, at least I‚Äôm dealing with it now and not in another 20 years.

The present moment is where I can't smoke cigarettes, drink, or smoke weed. I‚Äôll have to figure out skills to deal with my feelings and life situations without those substances.

I started working out. And by working out, I mean walking 30 minutes a day and starting with push-ups and sit ups. Nothing crazy, but something to get me up before everyone else is to get me motivated for the day. It‚Äôs small, but all of this together is starting to work. Much better than weed or alcohol ever did. I‚Äôm impulsive, so I want it to work today, but the work is long and I have a feeling it won‚Äôt ever end. Might as well get started now so I can get ahead of it. My mindset and motivation are better than they have been in years.

*‚ÄúI realized at a young age I had a weak mind...I wanna make sure that every single thing I feel is real. I want no masking. I want nothing to mask my ability to feel fear, or to overcome fear, whatever it may be.*

*I‚Äôm not saying that people who drink or do these things are trying to hide, some people just do it. For me, I think of it almost like a masking agent so then your mind doesn't have to work as hard and that means I'm losing."" - David Goggins*

*‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt always go your way, so you can‚Äôt get trapped in this  idea that just because you‚Äôve imagined a possibility for yourself that  you somehow deserve it. Your entitled mind is dead weight. Cut it loose.  Don‚Äôt focus on what you think you deserve. Take aim on what you are  willing to earn.‚Äù - David Goggins*  

*""The first is competence. Be brilliant in the basics. Don‚Äôt dabble in your job; you must master it. That applies at every level as you advance. Analyze yourself. Identify weaknesses and improve yourself. If you‚Äôre not running three miles in eighteen minutes, work out more; if you‚Äôre not a good listener, discipline yourself; ...

I had been smoking for 6-7 years and daily bongs from morning to night for at least 4, with the only exception being some short holidays. As someone with previous addictions to ‚Äúharder drugs‚Äù I‚Äôm no stranger to this process but I think the reason I struggled so much with weed is because it was my last remaining crutch, this plant has been helping me through all the struggles of previous addictions so much that without realising it, became the hardest addiction of all to kick. 

It started with ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just take a break‚Äù then the typical ‚Äúok I‚Äôll smoke my stash and start tomorrow‚Äù then ‚Äúok maybe I‚Äôll start to cut down after this weekend‚Äù and so on, you know the usual story. So this went on literally for the entire 2020 and started eating away at my self belief. When I was sober the only thing I wanted was to smoke and then when i smoke the only thing I wanted was to get sober. Eventually at the start of this year I just said fuck it, I‚Äôve spent a year doing this ‚Äúmaybe tomorrow‚Äù and tomorrow still hasn‚Äôt came. I threw out what I had left, smashed the bong, give away the grinder and haven‚Äôt looked back since. This was my way of mentally committing to it, I knew at this point there‚Äôs no going back. 


Week 1 was surprisingly decent, the main problems I had was the insomnia, warm flushes, night sweats, and nausea/feeling full after very little food, but I could look past these issues as I felt like I was getting a taste of life without weed, starting to feel emotions that I forgot even existed, some good and some bad but I take the negative emotions over just feeling numb and emotionless while smoking all day every day, I started to notice some more mental clarity and sharpness, even my sense of humour seemed to be coming back and just had a general feeling like things are getting better

Week 2 , now up to the last 4 days the positives I have noticed is sleep slowly but surely coming back, but that‚Äôs about it. I don‚Äôt want to sound negative or put anyone off but truthfully I feel like it gets worse before it gets better, feeling low motivation, almost constant brain fog, appetite non existent, anxiety through the roof, coughing up black shit and feeling pretty much the same as if I was smoking if not worse, I know I won‚Äôt go back at this point, I‚Äôve already came to far but this last few days has been a drag and mentally draining. It‚Äôs somewhat disheartening after such a positive first week but I understand that this isn‚Äôt permanent and my body is doing what it needs to repair so I guess there‚Äôs nothing else to do but just stick it out. 

I doubt many people will read this far and that‚Äôs fine, I just feel like I need to put what I‚Äôm feeling into words in a place where people can relate and have gone through/are going through something similar, as the majority of people I know in real life talk about weed like some miracle plant with 0 side effects. If that‚Äôs the case for them great, I won‚Äôt judge but it‚Äôs most certainly not the case for me.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49092722}"

So i started smoking weed when i was 17, i am 24 years old now, i started smoking just because it seemed fun to me, i already was a depressed kid who desperatly wanted some fun in his life.
7 years later i smoke 2g a day for years in a row.
As a kid i was always struggling with work, getting panic attacks when i needed to work etc.
So i tried getting therapy etc but nothing worked, 7 years later, still no job after like 15 tries of working and having a panic attack after.
Since nothing has changed in years, just me sitting at home gaming and being quite bored, my mom told me i had to go to rehab, i didnt want to but i agreed, i understood.
My longest time sober is 11 days, with a couple times 2 to 3 days. But now that i am sober again now for 2 days, the depression and boredom is killing me, litterally saying out loud all day fuck this boring depressed life, fuck everything.

But the part where i am really struggling is does weed help me cope with my depression since it‚Äôs in the family and it was there before weed. Or will it ever get better without.. setting at home for years without a job due to panic attacks is killing me, with weed it‚Äôs fine, but without im just way too depressed, i sit in a chair in the dark for hours, that‚Äôs how i spend life sober.

After smoking consistently for the better part of 14 years, enough was enough and I knew I needed to make a change. Weed had cost me jobs, relationships, almost got me in serious criminal trouble, and as a whole just wasn't good for me anymore. I love weed, and I probably always will, but I needed to love myself again. Weed or any substance addiction is the ultimate one sided relationship. And it's cool at first, but at a certain point, it sucks putting love and effort into something, and this object of affection isn't doing anything back for you

I'm not sure about you guys, but I would always do what I called ""kush fasts"" where I would take 3 month breaks every year. I started my breaks back in 2017 and when 2020 came, I knew I wanted to take it to the next level. I'm not going to sit here and say it was easy, because it wasn't. Is my life drastically better?? Not by any means, but I'm in a much better place after just 366 days. I have stable work, I'm back in school again, and things are really looking up

Once or twice a day, I get hit by a wave of ""unreality"". It's kinda like being stoned but with none of the pleasant effects. I'm distanced from my senses with a flattening of depth perception, and perhaps a brief moment of existential dread. I feel dumbed out. Feels like something in my mind gets desynchronized from the rest, and the wires are unplugged. I just try to relax and wait for it to come back online, but it's a bit anxiety inducing. I don't think it's a seizure - it's almost like reality is too real and my nervous system is suddenly overwhelmed. Gonna get a doctor's opinion if it persists.


Other than that, I feel like I'm on autopilot all day and a ""different version"" of me is behind the wheel, watching my thoughts whiz by. Thankfully this different version is able to talk with other people just fine, and simulate being a normal person a little better than stoned me was ever able to. This reassures me that my brain is probably okay.


My thinking/reasoning is a bit clouded all day with brief periods of mental sharpness. This contrasts with the first week of sobriety wherein I felt extra sharp and wasn't having these weird spells. I'm very aware of it because I struggle to focus intellectually on my job (programming) during the cloudy periods. I grab a hold of the sharp periods to cram in work. Programming is somewhat creative, and it's a struggle to feel inspired enough to synthesize my ideas right now. This was part of why I quit (I felt fried and hit a wall at work), and I'd hoped I would be mostly functional by now. I was almost always high on the job.


Maybe it's because of the insomnia. Hoping I keep a firm grip on reality until this eventually ends. Little worried about having a psychotic break or a panic attack (been years since my last panic attack). I'd sometimes feel similarly if I got way too high, but my inner voice has always been able to cut through the bad vibes and remind me that I'm smart and sane.


I've spent so much of my life stoned and also sleep deprived, so I think my brain is miscalibrated and needs to adjust to running at a different pace.


Is this normal? Is it a sign of the damage I did over the years? How long does it last?

I'm 17, and I smoked weed for the past 3 years. I'm a healthy person excluding my drug use. I meditate, workout, and journal semi-consistently. I usually cop 1 or 2 wax carts every 2 weeks. Then I chief 24/7 non-stop for like 3-5 days until I run out.

Originally, when I'd run out, I used to get cravings only the next day or two. BUT, as I kept my habit up, the period prolonged and became more painful. Now, when I run out of a cart, I legit have a light sense of despair for the next week. I feel unhappy, hopeless, and anxious.

Recently, I've also started to feel a little sad long term. My self-worth has gone down with my mood. My lust for life has dwindled. I used to attribute my sadness to not having a partner. For a time, I actually believed a partner would provide me the permanent high that I sought. What a joke haha

JUST NOW, I had a groundbreaking epiphany. IT'S WEED THAT HAS MADE ME SO UNHAPPY. May seem obvious, but it wasn't to me. Weed has really fucked with my reward system and deluded me. I actually believed weed was helping me to relax and stay emotionally afloat. LMAO. My shit was laced with crack. Literally did the exact opposite.

Weed is always in the back of my mind, and I rarely feel content without it now. Weed has slowly diminished my emotional well-being. SO I WILL QUIT! For a happier, more stable, me.

Unfortunately I let the withdrawals get to me and I ended up relapsing and smoking/taking thc oil for about 1-2 weeks straight before attempting to quit a 2nd time. 
This is day 5 of my 2nd attempt at quitting and I feel great. What‚Äôs different this time is I‚Äôve made lifestyle changes that actually have mitigated withdrawals as much as possible.

-Firstly what I did this time was give all my weed, oil, bongs, and papers to a friend who would keep it at her house so there was no possibility to relapse again.
-Secondly I started eating clean, because the initial withdrawals made me so nauseous I couldn‚Äôt even stomach junk food anymore. I started drinking fruit/veggie smoothies and slowly building back up my appetite from there. I know this can be hard at first, so I  
-(thirdly) started exercising in the morning (just a brisk walk in the neighbourhood followed by bodyweight exercises) to force my body to have an appetite and also get the natural endorphins that exercise provides.

By doing these 3 simple things my body is quickly and effectively adjusting to sober life again, and I‚Äôm able to be truly happy and face the issues that I was previously masking with my marijuana abuse. I‚Äôm also more clear-minded and I am able to go back to the hobbies that I stopped when I was high all the time (ask me about my grown-up content if you‚Äôre 18+ and into girls). The only withdrawal symptoms I‚Äôve had during this 2nd attempt is vivid and crazy dreams, but exercising first thing in the morning helps ground me and helps me understand that it was just a dream. Now I actually kind of look forward to the adventures I have in my dreams. Eating healthy foods regularly and not binge eating before bed (which I did all the time when I smoked) also helps makes the dreams less disturbing and more manageable. 

I know it‚Äôs hard, but you really have to know your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and what it is you want out of life. Did I want to be truly happy and fulfilled, or be fake happy by being high all the time?

last April, I realized how toxic my friends were and how much weed and tobacco was controlling my life. I couldn‚Äôt eat without smoking, and if I tried to take a bite, I would immediately feel sick to my stomach. I was irritable, tired, I coughed up black shit every morning, I had short of breath, I wheezed. ended up cutting off those toxic friends and decided I was done moling so I stopped smoking all together, cold turkey, for 3 weeks. it was the beginning of Covid and I was laid off of work so I was able to relax and deal with any withdrawals in the comfort of my own home. 

during my tolerance break I realized how nice it was to have a clear head and be able to carry a decent conversation without worrying if I was too high to even have a conversation. I went outside a lot, I made more art, I did a lot of thinking and had many realizations. after the 3 weeks I started smoking weed again, but no tobacco. 

fast forward to January, almost a year later and I haven‚Äôt had a day where I have been sober since. I‚Äôm realizing just how much weed controls my life and my thoughts. I know I‚Äôm using it to numb the pain and anxiety I feel. I know that I need to do the work on myself in order to heal, and I‚Äôm doing that by seeing a therapist.

I'm not sure any of this will make sense, im just going to kind of ramble off everything in my mind and it might be a bit jumbled.


I have been telling myself to quit smoking or at least cut back (really should just quit) and I just don't. I keep telling myself ""its just weed, its not that bad"" but this other person's post made me realize it is probably holding me back from growing mentally/emotionally.


Weed was always an escape and helped with anxiety. Shitty childhood and all that. And somewhere down the line it just became a daily habit. I feel more energized ans focused to do chores, food tastes amazing, and its just relaxing. My life is much better than it once was, but I still fall back on it when I'm stressed and really, just to unwind at the end of the day. Every day. And my boyfriend in the past said he didn't have a problem with how much I smoked, but we haven't talked about it in a while but I just get the sense he thinks it's too much now. So I try to hide when I do it and hope he doesn't figure it out. 

And now, like I said before, I'm wondering if it's holding me back. I've made a lot of progress when it comes to my mental health, but I feel it should be better. And to cope with things I know there's better/more productive things I can do like meditate or hike (which i used to LOVE but lately I've been too lazy) but instead of that I keep telling myself weed is not that bad, im not addictive, yadda yadda. Oh AND I always have trouble sleeping and of course weed helps me with that. Melatonin and things like that don't help much. 

Soooo idk idk what im really looking for here. I guess tips on how you stopped convincing yourself that weed isn't that bad, and what you've done to stop? I feel so pathetic because it's not your typical addictive drug and I feel so silly saying I have a weed problem but I do feel like I definitely do. Addiction runs deep in my family and even though I never got into hard drugs, I do think this is becoming a problem.

It started off fine, and I was able to control the amount I smoked all while taking online courses but once the first semester ended (I finished with straight A‚Äôs :) ) I went overboard. I smoked everyday for months, and I greened out once during that time frame. It was a horrible and scary experience. I felt like I had lost myself. 

Recently I decided to quit because it was affecting my mental health (something I have always struggled with because of family), and also to try and focus on the upcoming semester on top of playing sports in college. I was sober for about a week then I stupidly made the decision to smoke a bit more then I should have because I wasn‚Äôt feeling good that night, and I greened out again. I legitimately thought I was going to die (I know you can‚Äôt) and I didn‚Äôt sleep at all that night. That was really a wake up call for me, and I‚Äôve been sober now for about 4 days and have no desire to go back to smoking weed.. I know it isn‚Äôt a long time but I‚Äôm proud of myself for getting my shit together. I‚Äôve felt better about myself, I can feel the fog leaving my brain, Ive gotten better sleep without waking up during the night and started having dreams again, I feel more motivated, I‚Äôm starting to feel happier and looking forward to this semester on campus.

I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is just support, and tips from people who have been in my position. I don‚Äôt have anyone to seriously talk to about this, and tonight‚Äôs been hard for me. Any and all responses are greatly appreciated!",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4131388}"

So my partner (29M) & and I (27F) both quit at the beginning of the year cold turkey (2 years using) . Apart from the usual withdrawal symptoms, we‚Äôve been doing quite well. The only place we‚Äôre being seriously affected is in the bedroom..... 


Quick background: We‚Äôve always had a great sex life (8 years together) during & pre cannabis. My partner usually can‚Äôt keep his hands off of me, always touching whenever we are together. Normal for us is almost every night as it‚Äôs our ‚Äútreat‚Äù to end a days worth of hard work. I have a very high libido & my body in a way has come to depend on this. 


Now onto the issue, my partner is having trouble maintaining an erection and says things don‚Äôt feel as good which has resulted in his libido slightly decreasing. We‚Äôve tried switching things up and pulling all the tricks in our book but it‚Äôs not helping. We spoke about it last night, I told him we can cool things in the meantime and to not stress himself because his body just needs to even out. He replied with no, he wants to continue trying every night. I want to support him as much as I can but I can feel his frustrations while he‚Äôs ‚Äútrying‚Äù. 


Is there anything I can do to help the process? Will things ever go back? I miss my overly affectionate man and the bomb ass sex. 


I also want to add that my partner isn‚Äôt overweight and works out regularly. We have a very good relationship and this is the first time it‚Äôs been an issue for us. I don‚Äôt have any couple friends who‚Äôve smoked and quit so don‚Äôt have anyone to turn to. Just looking for some advice or hope lol.

A bit ago I opened my grinder and the sneezing and runny nose hit hard immediately, and I even developed hives. I tested to make sure by rubbing some pollen on a patch of skin and sure enough, developed hives there. Apparently there's a good chance of developing an allergy if you consume a lot of an allergen over an extended period then stop suddenly - happened to me w peanuts a few years ago.

So before the end of the year I tried to quit my weed habits, but I just can handle it for 1 month, after that I started to meet people, and I felt anxious about that, also we drink so I get more weed needs. I don't even smoke with people I usually smoke at the end of the day, lonley watching some TV.

3 days ago I had this moto accident in the work, I'm pizza delivery and I get foot inquiry so I can't move too much, before that I threw all the weed that I had and today is my third day without smoking. I feel good, but a little scared, I have a friend that he really can't stop smoking and he is already 29 (me 22), I don't want to be like him, all the time worry about this and not getting to much success. Just wish me luck, thanks you all.

Now I recently moved out of home and living alone means I have unlimited access to weed more or less, and I'm now beginning to come to terms with the fact that it might be ruining the little productivity I had before and it's sending me into a downward spiral mental health-wise.

I‚Äôm unhappy, sure, but I know too well if I go back to my old ways of smoking nothing will ever change, I‚Äôm holding onto hope that if I abstain from weed, and I reach out to friends especially after lockdown, I can push on from there.

I do just want to find love though, and it hurts me to see so many happy couples and people in this world who have found contentment and stability, I just feel like a lost soul. But I know I have to love myself and work on my self esteem issues, I feel at least more proud for being sober if nothing else, I don‚Äôt expect to be rewarded by life for this because I know there‚Äôs so much more I need to work on about my character, but the more you put in life the more you get back.

I'm in my 30s and have smoked pot since I was a teen. I've always had some issues with general anxiety, which pot had never helped with or hurt. Pot is a big part of my social life, just everyone I know smokes and its expected to smoke when we're together. 

I dont know why, but over the past year, smoking has made my anxiety skyrocket to the point of having panic attacks and paranoia. In the past month, reliably, every time I smoke (which is usually daily after work), it happens. 

Example from last night: I was convinced that my apartment was on fire. I was pacing my unit all night checking all the burners and my furnace, checking my ash tray feeling the walls for heat. I was convinced the place was filling up with thick smoke and that I couldn't breath from it. I went into the lobby to see if the whole place looked smokey (it did to me) and went outside of my unit to see if I saw smoke (I didn't, but it did appear that the whole earth was filled with smoke and I still felt like I was breathing in ash). 

Last week I had a breakdown because I was convinced someone was trying to break in to my apartment I barricaded the door, I was that sure of it. I live im a super nice suburban apartment and guarantee there was no actual threat happening, but in the heat of the moment it was all I could think about. 

Its so gotten bad enough that I can't function, I decided I need to at minimum take a break. I offered all of my pot and pipes to a friend, who has been trying to talk me out of quitting. ""Its probably not the pot, it helps with anxiety, it doesn't cause it. You've been smoking for so long, why would this start suddenly?"" If she won't take it im just going to pitch it. After being a daily smoker for 15 years, I know it will be too tempting if I just keep it in a drawer. 

Has anyone else experienced a sort of sudden onset of really bad paranoia like this after being a long time daily smoker?

I came back home to a legal state at the beginning of April. I did well for the first while with weed, only smoking after work (albeit everyday and while alone). 4/20 hit and because we were WFH I decided to smoke that day. Then that turned into smoking the entire week. Then it‚Äôs my birthday in July and I realize it‚Äôs been 3 months and I‚Äôve been smoking at work the entire time. I put so much stress on my poor mother seeing me smoke so much. We got into fights about my constant smoking. 

I decided I needed to quit. I have done cold turkey in the past and it made me extremely depressed and crazy. So I started smoking only after work. Then only one day a week + weekends. Then I‚Äôve a week. Then once every 2 weeks. Then I went 5 weeks on Halloween. I took acid and bought weed. And all I could think about was how negatively weed affected my life. How I haven‚Äôt been able to think clearly for 3 years. How every episode of severe depression in the last 3 years arrived after quitting weed and every episode of mania arrived when I started smoking a ton. I decided then that I had to quit.

I made it almost 2 months. 7 weeks and 5 days to be exact. I had no withdrawal symptoms for the first month. Then I had a thought of ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôll smoke weed just this once.‚Äù And the next 2 weeks I had obsessive ruminating thoughts. Waves of anxiety. Just searching for weed. To be honest by then end of it I thought it was a bit performative and self imposed. I had been using weed to cover up anxiety and depression for years, it felt like I was self imposing anxiety + depression to get weed.

I did break the day after Christmas. Honestly waking up that day I didn‚Äôt even really want weed. I sort of pressured myself into it because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the last chance.‚Äù  I bought a 50 mg brownie and a joint. Then another joint the day after. Then on New Years I bought another 100mg brownie and a joint. I smoked the joint the day after the brownie and ended up going to the dispensary. I meant to only get a joint but while I was in there I bought another 100mg brownie as well. I got destroyed that Saturday. 

I‚Äôve been trying to quit since then. Smoked half a joint Monday to lessen the withdrawal. Smoked again Friday and Sunday and Monday. So now I‚Äôm at day 1. I‚Äôm so annoyed because what started as smoking weed when I had a day off has extended into 2 weeks and an additional $150 on weed. Looking at the day counter knowing that I would be 71 days free if I just stayed strong sucks. The only positive in this is recognizing that I need to quit forever. That I want to quit forever. 

I know quitting isn‚Äôt linear and I still made improvements but I‚Äôm just scared about withdrawal. Honestly I‚Äôm scared about being alive in the life I built for myself. A life that stoned me built. But the only way to go from here is forward. Fuck.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54912335}"

Thanks for whoever takes the time to read this. It‚Äôs hard telling some friends how I feel and I hope that this post is okay.

Anyway, my decision to stop smoking happened last week. In my life, I was never a huge smoker. I was actually in the army from 2012-early 2019 and couldn‚Äôt really smoke anyway. Late 2019 I went through some bad things in my life and then covid/quarantine happened. I live alone so weed was my comfort when I felt alone, anxious, depressed. In 2020 I got laid off my job, trying to pay my mortgage/bills, my father got covid, my neighborhood had many protests/riots and became a source of anxiety. I was alone 95% of the time. I ended a 2 year relationship with someone who hurt me immensely.

Long story short, by the end of 2020, I was smoking every few hours, downplaying exactly how much. I didn‚Äôt want people to know HOW much I was smoking. But I‚Äôm trying to change all that. I started taking anti depressants and am on week 2. I gave all my weed away. It‚Äôs day 4 of no weed and I‚Äôm struggling. But I know it‚Äôs for the best. I have job interviews coming up and have been focusing on being healthy (lost 10lbs already) so not all is lost.

But to be honest, after this year I am having trouble coping with everything that happened. I have my MMJ card. I have been having anxiety/panic attacks more than usual and I used to use weed to cope. But I know it was just a band aid.

TLDR: Has anyone stopped smoking weed during a very hard time in their life and what did you do to help you push through? 

Thank you.

My girlfriend and I broke up November 2020 after 3.5 years, and in hindsight I can see how see was both a trigger for my relapses (she did not understand my needs and boundaries, and I let her walk all over me and just coped by smoking) and she also occasionally would smoke with me.

I'm wondering if there is any tips for not relapsing on long term when these realizations becomes more faint memories and being sober becomes normal ?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7160197}"

2021-01-12 10:56:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kvu9tt/tonight_will_mark_seven_days_pot_free/,Tonight will mark seven days pot free.,"Yesterday was a pretty tough day. It‚Äôs been tough in general- I was supposed to graduate high school in June of 2020 and so I‚Äôve been without friends since last March. It really started to get to me yesterday. I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs because I spend so much time with one person- my father- and when him and I are in any kind of altercation, I get this horrible, harrowing, empty feeling of loneliness. I know though that it is because every time I felt this way before, I numbed it with weed. I would just push down the emotions and deal with it ‚Äúlater‚Äù. I guess now is later. Tearfully, all I could manage was a simple ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù message to some of my closest friends but thankfully that was enough to pull me out of my funk- slowly but surely. 

I finally got the best sleep I‚Äôve had in a week. 8+ hours for the first time in two years without pot putting me to bed. I of course can‚Äôt remember my dream but I know that I had an extensive one- that‚Äôs something else I‚Äôm thankful for. 

Though all I talk about is how much better I‚Äôm feeling and all the benefits I‚Äôm experiencing, I‚Äôm not going to lie. I fucking miss it. The motion of packing the bowl and pulling it through is something I can still feel even though I‚Äôve quit- akin to how a cigarette smoker feels they need to do something with their hands once they quit. I miss the social aspect, the laughs I would have, and just having the ability to numb my brain so I wouldn‚Äôt have to think about all the horrible shit going on. I know that I just can‚Äôt do that to myself anymore. It was not the right thing to do. I have to face what‚Äôs troubling me head on. 

If you are trying to quit, if you just quit, or you have for a while, know that you are valued. I‚Äôve been making these posts all week and I‚Äôm going to try to lean off of it so I don‚Äôt use it as a crutch so much- but the stories all of you share help me and other people so much than you realize. I don‚Äôt know what I would do if this community didn‚Äôt exist. Apologies for the long ass diary entry.

2021-01-12 10:42:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kvu0s0/in_search_of_some_encouragement/,In search of some encouragement,"Hey everyone, 

I'm writing on here because this community helped me to get to where I am today, and I feel like I just need some encouraging words from people to help me get through this tough period im going through. 

I'm currently on day 677 of not smoking weed, in fact writing this down is crazy to me to think I've done this long already. Previous to this, I was fully addicted and smoked it every day for almost 8 years. It ruined friendships, Jobs, career progression, family relationships, alot of things. 

I tried to quit many times over the years but always went back to it. I finally decided I'd had enough and had my last smoke at a drake concert in London April the 8th, 2019. It was actually really easy to quit because I finally wanted to, when I tried to quit before its because i felt like I should, but I didnt want to. 

For the longest time I was so happy that I quit, it was so easy for me after the initial few months, I could even be around friends who were rolling up in front of me and it wouldn't bother me at all, nor would I be in the slightest bit tempted to smoke. I wouldn't even think about getting high, it didn't even cross my mind. Again, this is because I didnt want to smoke, and for everyone on here trying to quit, or who feel like they should, a word of advice from me would be you need to want it, like alot. Quitting is one of the hardest things I've ever done, but also the best. 

However recently it has been on my mind alot. This year has been hard for everyone of course, for me though, in summer of 2020 me and girlfriend of 10 years broke up, it was a mutual decision between us both but it was tough. We lived together and I've had to move out into an apartment by myself, working from home and its been hard for me. I have 0 human interaction all day every day because of lockdown, and generally mentally I've not been doing great. 

I've been having thoughts about smoking again alot recently, mainly because of how lonely I feel. One of the things that weed was amazing for for me was, being able to look at situations and emotions in a different way, not necessarily a better or worse way, just different. And I think this is the main reason I'm thinking about it, in addition to this, boredom. There is only so much YouTube and TV I can watch until I'm bored, and we all know that getting high makes doing nothing enjoyable. 

I kind of feel like it's been so long since I quit, that I've forgotten alot of the reasons I quit in the first place, which is why in my mind I am thinking about it more. Luckily I'm not in an environment where it is at my disposal, and I don't live near friends who smoke, which helps. 

I think the main thing from keeping me from smoking is that if I did it, it would go one of two ways. Let me preface this by saying in my final year or two of smoking, I had huge huge anxiety problems, however these completely disappeared once I got sober. I still get anxious about normal things people get anxious over, but not the constant crippling anxiety that I had before. The first way it would go is that I would smoke and get anxious, not enjoy it, and be furious with myself that I smoked, and that 677 counter gets reset to 0. The second thing, and worse thing, would be that I smoked and loved it, and knowing myself, I would fall back into bad habits of smoking daily again. 

I dont really know why I'm writing this to be honest, I'm not going to smoke, at least I don't think, I kinda just want to be reminded of all the good things that come from giving up. Its been so long that being sober is normal, it's no longer the new clear headed mind that was so prevalent in the early stages. 

Any encouraging words would really be appreciated, I just need some reminding thats all. 

Sorry this is so long. 

Thanks for reading.

2021-01-12 08:47:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kvry10/one_week_down_day_8/,One week down!!! Day 8,"Wow. I can‚Äôt believe I made it this far!!! I know it isn‚Äôt much but I‚Äôm so damn proud of myself!! I‚Äôve  had depression for years, a mental breakdown where I walked out of work for four months and suicidal for years. I‚Äôm so grateful weed was in my life during this time, because there was no way I would have gotten through it if I couldn‚Äôt numb myself so I could deal with things at my own pace. Well, I think I can do it so I‚Äôm going to share what‚Äôs worked so far for me. 

Prequitting:

- I‚Äôve tried to quit in the past but withdraw symptoms were too strong. I realized I needed to slowly cut down so sleep, increased heart rate etc would be less dramatic.

- I went from 15 bowls a day to 1-3 only in the evening over a six month period. I tried a combination of pushing back my start time and just recording on a calendar when I started smoking and how much. I tried to approach this without judgment and just observe.

- Recognizing I needed to deal with mental health I tried to keep a regular meditation and yoga schedule. The month prior I put this as a daily thing, even if it was for one minute a day. 

- Cycling between high use days, which started to make me feel gross so I‚Äôd start later and smoke less the next day worked wonders! 

- When I needed to get down from 15 a day to single digits I would say I could smoke as much as I want but before each time I needed to take ten deep breaths. Eventually I was able to take ten breaths and not need to smoke. 

- Getting into tarot really helped me navigate and see my world. Making monthly goals also helped. 

- I got an acupressure mat that I would use in bed before going to sleep. This helped a lot! 

The week before:

- I was drinking 1 gal water a day, biking 20 min, doing yoga, tai chi, meditation and a cleansing/energizing chakra healing everyday. Again, some days it was just a couple minutes but I ALWAYS did it.

- The day before I quit I smoked five bowls. The next day 9:40pm rolled around and I realized I hadn‚Äôt smoked at all. I told myself I could just try to go to sleep with out it. I felt secure knowing I had a bowl ready to go next to my bed just in case. I ended up falling asleep and when I woke up I was so proud that was the first time by choice I hadn‚Äôt smoked in 4 years! I was a heavy user 2 years before as well. 

What has helped stay on track:

- Taking as much rest as I need and allowing myself to not be productive if needed. I‚Äôve had great energy spurts though but I‚Äôm so tired at 5pm on!

- Falling asleep is hard but each night I make a big glass of chamomile tea with milk and honey.

- I celebrated my success the following morning, because I know night is harder. 

- I allowed myself to eat whatever I‚Äôve wanted to each day! Now that I‚Äôm at day 8 I will be healthy again and will slowly start working out again. 

- My next goal will be 30 days. I‚Äôve been using some sleep aids and my plan is after 30 days to stop using them, but I don‚Äôt think that will be an issue.

Long term:

- I took a before photo of myself and I‚Äôm going to take one each month this year to track fitness and to see how my face changes. My skin is already rosier and stuff is healing on my body!


Every time before when I tried to quit and didn‚Äôt work I‚Äôd see it as a step much closer towards quitting than a day I didn‚Äôt try. I knew if I kept trying and dealing with my life it would just happen, and it did! I‚Äôm excited to get my life back, enjoy reality and most of all not have to avoid people in the evenings because I needed to be high. Sounds and smells are more intense and I feel like I‚Äôm accepted back into reality again. You can do it!!

I accomplished everything I wanted to do with my life while high. Now, without it, I'm bored stiff. I still do the things I used to do, they just aren't as fun, and my life feels 'blah'. All the wind has been zapped from my sails, and I'm just a normal Joe now. I did not get an energy boost or mental acuity from quitting, just crushing fatigue that lasted for several months.   


I really enjoy the way weed percolates my brain, for things like going outside for some exercise or playing music. It just brought a vividness to life, that I'm struggling to find again.   


So now I'm watching a lot of movies and TV shows (escapism). Makes me feel like a typical American instead of a cool stoner that can do what he wants, and can still be successful in life.   


Ok, so in some ways smoking weed was a rebellion against my parents because my dad hated it, and kicked me out of the house when I was a teenager for smoking it. So I guess I've had a chip on my shoulder and something to prove (That I can smoke and accomplish whatever I want in life). But, I lived that way my entire life, where every accomplishment felt better, because I did it despite smoking weed every day, and I could kind of ""prove the haters wrong"". 

So now I feel stuck here, and when I'm on my death bed, was this really all worth it? Life is meant to be enjoyed right?! I get way less satisfaction from knowing I'm sober, than the satisfaction I got from smoking and still keeping my shit together.

I am a 25 year old male and I have been smoking everyday since about 14. I would always do it with friends after school and then when I moved out of my parents and lived on my own it just got worse. I have always had women in my life that had an issue with it and I would either just hide it from them or just break it off then and there cus well screw that nagging. I use to only smoke bud but then as I grew up and got my own place I started getting into dabs around age 19. Needless to say I‚Äôm sure we all have been there, smoking everyday, every hour. Feeling like an absolute vegetable but oh well it‚Äôs what I wanted. I feel as though a decade of my life has been wasted because I got so attached. I believe truthfully you can smoke and have a productive/healthy life. At the same time I also know that‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt do. I don‚Äôt have self control, I will smoke just to smoke, cus I think I can hit that next level every single time, when in reality I‚Äôm just blowing through money. Which brings up another point, the fact that I have been living for so long paycheck to paycheck is depressing as hell and here I still am contemplating if my last 20 goes to my dealer or to some bread, milk, turkey, and maybe some cheese. I don‚Äôt really have many friends besides the ones I‚Äôve made over online gaming but they don‚Äôt even really know the extent of the struggles I deal with internally.

So I am here, to ask you all who may have gone through this to please post what helped you or what motivated you to stop. If you struggled financially due to weed what steps did you take to rebuild. I want to stop more than anything, and when I try, I make it about 10 hours max and I‚Äôm right back to figuring out how I can get my hands on it. Life seems so dull sober, and it‚Äôs depressing but being sober just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. Video games are more fun high, YouTube videos are more enjoyable high, sports on the TV, hell even food is more enjoyable high... and yet I‚Äôm not happy.

And it's weird but quitting the second time feels so much easier? I still have the same problems with sleep and general low energy but I haven't really craved or thought about weed that much. I've been focusing on keeping myself busy for the most part.

I've downloaded a habit tracking app to kinda keep myself accountable to a certain degree and it's doing wonders for me.

In just this one week:

1. I've finally picked up learning Japanese, I've been thinking about learning a third language for a long long time but never had the motivation to actually start. In just this one week, I've learned 100 Kanji characters, Hiragana + Katakana and made myself a study plan of what I'm tackling in what order. I'm super motivated and despite set backs I'm not smoking.
2. My kitchen has been clean EVERY day because everytime I get bored I get up to do something productive, even the little things, turn on a load of dirty clothes, make my bed etc anything no matter how small.
3. I've been practicing drums every day again, even for just 10 minutes and it feels really good to see some progress again especially considering I was paying the subscription for my online lessons all this time but never using them.

2021-01-12 04:52:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kvoq5m/day_32_leavers_challenges_immediate_withdrawal_vs/,Day 32 - Leavers‚Äô challenges: Immediate withdrawal vs. negative feeling,"Hi all, I‚Äôve hit the 32nd day of my quit. I‚Äôm really happy to be here, and it‚Äôs in no small part thanks to all of you. I wanted to share here, tell you what worked for me, what challenges I faced and what you can expect if you make to here. Feel free to check my post history for the circumstances under which I quit - spoiler alert, they were pretty crap.

I no longer feel strong cravings towards weed - merely the occasional passing desire, which I immediately address. I do so by reminding myself that I won‚Äôt even consider doing it - I‚Äôm an addict, and I cannot fix myself if I‚Äôm smoking. One toke always leads to more. Accepting these simple facts is the first step to staying clear of weed. It is just never worth it to use again - moments later, cravings pass and you feel glad you didn‚Äôt smoke.

However, I think it‚Äôs important to point something out. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, there are two important aspects to the state of mind in the first few weeks of quitting. There‚Äôs immediate withdrawal - the itch to smoke, the sweating and irritability, the inability to eat or sleep. This is a nasty feeling, there‚Äôs no doubt about it, and many of you who post here on days 1-14 are heavily burdened by this aspect. However, I‚Äôm wary of offering false hope to those early leavers, because the second aspect lasts longer and is much more difficult to deal with. I‚Äôll call this negative feeling.

Negative feeling is much more insidious, because we tend to begin to notice it only once immediate withdrawal subsides. Hence, we don‚Äôt connect it to smoking weed - and this may not be entirely incorrect. After all, many of us have reasons why we kept smoking. We suffered bouts of depression, fits of anger, an overactive mind or even physical pain we sought to medicate. Negative feeling causes all this to come rushing back, but enhances it with a strong dose of depression and anger that I believe comes with quitting weed.

Negative feeling isn‚Äôt constant - I see many posts on here from people as early as Day 7 describing a state of bliss they enter, feeling very pleased and utterly resolved to have quit. Perhaps some are lucky enough to avoid most of the negative feeling. However, I believe that negative emotions and thoughts will come bubbling to the surface, even if temporary happiness, distraction or satisfaction of another craving delays that process. This is certainly what I faced. Sometimes I felt excited and felt I was in the clear, then got plunged right back down into the worst of moods. The reasons for my anger or sadness are many - why did my ex leave me? Why does my mother make my relationship with her difficult? Why do I resent this person, or this person? Why have I fucked up so much of my life and am I taking these baby steps still at my age? 

The fact of the matter is, we need to identify these thoughts and emotions - or rather, identify their source. While it would be presumptuous to blame it all on weed and its withdrawal, there is simply no reason to feel down on oneself when we are making the decision to quit. By all rights, we should be elated! It helped me immensely to realize that in the first two months of stopping, there‚Äôs no reason at all to take these thoughts seriously. To run with them, give them attention, consider their content. For emotions, a similar principle holds true. We should not lash out at those around us, or consider ourselves incapable of action. However, as opposed to thoughts, emotions must be focused on to be processed. 

This sub is full of helpful advice on how to deal with cravings and withdrawal. Tips ranging urge surfing and the four D‚Äôs to melatonin for sleep and comfort food to eat come to mind. However, having offered my perspective on negative feeling as a separate part of quitting, and how to frame it, here are my tips for dealing with it as effectively as possible. Note that I agree with many here on the value of daily meditation practice, as it will help you with a few of these tips.

1) Mindfully accept your state. Understand that you feel like this for a good while, and that you must learn to cope with these emotions if you‚Äôre to stay quit. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up, nor wallow in self-pity, just give yourself compassion for what‚Äôs going on. If you lie awake and thoughts of old regrets come up, let them. Understand that your suffering has meaning. When bad feeling arises, sit with it, don‚Äôt fight or suppress it. This is what you‚Äôve been doing with weed, don‚Äôt replace weed with anger. Anger is a way to suppress emotions we do not want to deal with, such as grief or shame.

2) Seek additional support, wherever you can. This sub is good, but it may not be enough. MA has online meetings all day every day (follow the sidebar link) where you can hear others‚Äô experiences. You‚Äôll find you‚Äôre not alone in this. If you have trusted friends who want to listen to you, talk to them openly about what you‚Äôre going through. Explain that it‚Äôs a part of stopping, and that talking about it helps (IT DOES). 

3) Walk the line between care giver and disciplinarian. The first 60 days are not a time for you to start a daily gym plan, or take on extra work. But you also shouldn‚Äôt lie in bed for hours and see no one. Once initial cravings subside, set some tasks you aim to complete every day. For me, these were ~15 minutes of meditation (mindful state), a run for exercise (endorphins), journaling (emotion processing, progress logging), speaking to a friend or family member, and doing physical therapy exercises for my back. Simple stuff you know will help and you can knock down easily. If you fail but don‚Äôt smoke - still a win. Try again tomorrow.

4) Stay present. Do not wait for the sun to rise. Stay entirely in the present. What I‚Äôve said here may imply that you should wait for bad feeling to subside - that‚Äôs the tricky part. I‚Äôm not entirely sure it does of its own accord; much of it does, but you need to actively work on processing, examining your resentments (I recommend MA‚Äôs 12 steps, or Russell Brand‚Äôs Freedom if you want a more casual version), perhaps seeing a therapist if you have that option. Don‚Äôt get caught up in plans for the future or regrets of the past. Today needs your full attention, and you only need to make it to the end of today. If you overinvest in the future, you‚Äôll start wondering if you‚Äôll ever get better. The truth is, you won‚Äôt know until you get there how recovery will treat you. Posts of those who have left for a year shouldn‚Äôt inspire you to say ‚ÄúWOW! I just need to abstain for 365 days and I‚Äôll be in the money!‚Äù They should push you to focus more heavily on process today, in the conviction that your efforts are bound to pay off.

5) Remember that no matter how bad the urge, feeling or thought, it will pass. If not within 5 minutes, then within 15. If not within 15 minutes, then within the hour. And if not then, then within 3 hours or even at the end of the day. That‚Äôs all you need to do. Stay sober for a little longer. Allow the urge, feeling or thought to be; accept it. Know that it will pass.

I hope this long post resonates with some of you and helps you on your journeys. Just by taking the time to read it, you‚Äôve reaffirmed your commitment to staying clear of weed, which is what we‚Äôre all aiming to do. Well done, I believe in you, you‚Äôre gonna make it and you‚Äôre gonna find out what you‚Äôre truly capable of.

TL;DR: quitting weed comes with immediate withdrawal but also negative feeling, which lasts longer. Learn to cope with negative feeling and put it into perspective, or suffer the consequences. You can learn to deal with it effectively.",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7032901}"

&#x200B;

My first high was kinda scary at the beggining , i took a couple hits and didnt feel anything , and then the high came to me without me knowing it , its kinda hard to explain it but its like the natural sensation of you knowing where you are and what are you doing right now kinda faded , like when you thinking about something there is always a feeling behind your thoughts that roots you to reality and seperate you from your thoughts and actual reality , like your senses are are blocking you from fading away inside your mind becuase they keep you connected to the outside reality  , and when the first hits started to make me feel high , i remember thinking about something and as long as i keep the thought line im more and more attached to it and forgetting about the ''Natural GPS'' that i talked about before , and as a result of the weed physical effect blurring my senses with a feeling of electric streams rushing through my body and continuously focusing on this (becuase there wasnt like something else to do , we were sitting outdside just to smoke) , i begun to think im dreaming , for example : my friend had to hide the bong and i knew that because we finished smoking and we cant just leave it there, and suddenly i completely forgot it and everything else and shifted into a state that seemed like a dream , i didnt thought where i was and what we were doing and just focused on what is going on , like the primal instinct of you rooted to knowing where you are now and what are you doing and the logical reasons behind it just went off , and after a couple seconds of this i shifted back to a clear state of mind and after that went back to the high state of me thinking im dreaming , couple times like that got me existential paranoia when it was heppening but after 10 minutes it just came off and like the 2 states of mind that i mentioned connected to me just being kinda enjoying the weed sensations and knowhing where i am and everything is really cool . 

 

You can understand that a experience like that left me wondering more about ''mind states'' and drugs , I wasnt a  curious boy back than , I had good grades but i didnt had that  feeling  of  curiosity   
 about all the world , of course i was a normal child , but you know some start to develop hobbies and dreams , but back than i was just kinda living that moment you know , and the experience with weed suddenlly pulled all the  curiosity I had in me and focused it on drugs , i was more  curious than ever about weed at that point and the nature of the high life .

I started smoking once in a 2 weeks and I remember just doing it and being high and enjoying being pulled away from my natural state of mind thinking wow this is so cool and thinking I  found my hobby and everyone else doing some useless shit , seperation beetween me and my social environment but at the same time feeling a connection to a new community of stoners on social media and people I met.

with the time passing I got more and more into that and less and less doing my homework and learning , but it was 9th grade to i managed to finish junior high school with good grades. 

When i started going to high school , me and my friend started more and more making weed our social life and our hobby , and than I begun asking myself about my daily life and  progression and I realized that Im not doing anything besides smoking weed , I could listen to songs and imagine myself on a stage singing that song or me learning in a university and getting the highest grades in my class , like I started imagining my life while im high instead of living it . for example : If I had a test in school in 2 days id  rather do the minimum required  to know about what is going to be on the test and with the rest of the time id rather to smoke and imagining me learning to the test all night and understanding the matter that best way i can , and when I get home Ill to sleep becuase I dont have the energy to actually to that, It was like an excuse or a false sense of  ''Im gonna fix everything and its gonna be fine''  , during the high it all sound so real and feeling motivated but when the high came off i dont want to think at all ,just want to smoke and fill my mind with all of the randon scenes or thoughts and things I can do , but in reality im not really doing anything. 

 i started living in my own head and smoking everyday, rather than actually being productive and doing hard work to success . 

and its effecting my social life too , I begun asking about all the nature of our social life and the future of mankind , and its accompanied by a feeling of  loneliness , like im lost in the existance of being a human with thoughts and feelings  and a mind that processes information in order to define our reality .

I find it very hard to quit smoking , also becuase I feel like I already ''lost it''  , and I cant find the true    
natural happiness , I wish i had a girlfriend that I can talk to but at the same time I dont understand why I feel like I need that  , Im feeling so lost and I dont know how will I quit and get my life back and not being consumed by the psychoeffective high of cannabis .

But something I struggled with for a long time was my addicted brain coming up with reasons, excuses, lies as to why I wanted it, should use it. 

I always felt like I should stop. I also had plenty reason to as well but when I ran out or had a few smokes left the addicted brain would kick in - I'm not ready yet, a little more wont hurt, I actually want a smoke tonight let's do it another time. Or even worse, I'd tell myself ""no I'm meant to be quitting"" over and over because I allowed myself to entertain it then eventually I'd give in. 

If you relate then try this: dont entertain any thought other than, or along the lines of ""I dont do that anymore"" then go distract yourself with something... video game, book, socialise, food, exercise. Immerse yourself in the activity and if you start to think about weed again ""I dont do that anymore"" then re focus your attention  to the activity.
 
I think after using weed for so damn long I had created a rut deep in my brain where if I planned to stop using or was close to stop using a (big) part of me would start to freak out and convince the side of me that wanted to do better to re use. It would use whatever exercise it could think of. 

So dont go there. Dont even entertain any it. Simply tell yourself that it's not what you do anymore and go distract yourself. Repeat and rinse. It has to be a hard no while your brain recovers. The distraction element is also important. Its amazing how quickly you can move on if you're doing these two things.

A few months ago I felt I was going insane. I was smoking constantly and told my roomate I felt I was losing it before we went for a surf on day. A few days later he had a heavy mental breakdown and was maniced( wasnt sleeping or eating and smoking constantly). He went home as we are in college, and gave up smoking both nicotine and weed for like 6 or so weeks. I too, scared from the situation and my mental state quit as well. When he came back to college he said the usual ""Im just gone smoke this little bit than take a break"" ""Im not gonna smoke out the bong"" ""not gonna smoke in the morning."" 

Im not judging at all, been down that road a thousand times. But Im seeing the cycle from a clear lense. Its hard to live in a house with 3 people who smoke from sun up to sun down. But im proud of myself for sticking to my goals and taking it a day at a time. All I can do is be there to help my buddy and roomate while simultaneously not go down with him...idk. Tuff situation but hes a big boy and makes his own decisions. 

Ive been a lot happier, more productive, confident and dependable since Ive stopped smoking. I hate to see the ones around me struggle and suffer as its nearly as painful as suffering myself. I know if I smoke once it will be a downward spiral into a constant haze. Anyways, the universe showed me what will happen if I break my streak and from this perspective I know I must keep clear.

I have let it become a habit to hit the snooze button in the mornings and lay in bed instead of getting up. I have made lists of the important things I need to do and let them pile up. I have sat on the couch every night after work for months, smoking a bowl and watching TV. I make excuses in my head why I can skip X or do Y later. NO MORE. My drive used to seem to come naturally to me but I now know that I have always had to fight for it, I just wasn't clear headed enough to realize it! Two weeks sober and my head is much clearer, I can see my thoughts constantly lean towards being lazy and taking the easy way, doing what feels good in the short term instead of what will build long lasting stability. I will not hit the snooze buttons of life any longer and I will fight the excuses in my head that constantly put myself down!

I'm feeling good, mostly, and the physical symptoms are mainly over for me which is so good. However, I do rely on many of the testimonies I read here because this sub was my main motivator for stopping the complex addiction that weed is. I'm anxious about my future and I'm doing this for myself and I do know everyone is different but: In a parallel universe, even if many ex-smokers in here never touched weed in their lives, wouldn't they still have problems? I mean, that's life. I remember feeling very bored when I wasn't a stoner, I remember having bad days as well, I remember having to get my shit together (of course weed made getting shit together much worse). I read this in a comment a few minutes ago: most people come here and post when they are feeling bad (the exact same case with this post). So the question is: Can I still blame weed even when I hopefully get to 12 months, for example? Is it all bad and no good? Is it really just a matter of replacing habits? Or are we on a journey so long that it's normal for people to come here and vent even if they are already physically and mentally detached from the addiction (even after PAWS)? I know quitting weed is like leaving a heavy bag pack behind but can you blame weed forever? What's the timeline?

Been smoking daily for over 3 years now probably it‚Äôs a bit of a blur lol. I moved abroad when I was 17, and I‚Äôve always been really independent living in different countries and proud of where my journey has taken me. I‚Äôve realised that I used weed to deal with stuff that happened to me during my teenage years and in my 20s which I never let affect me since I didn‚Äôt want other people‚Äôs harm towards me to have an effect on me, basically I saw it as meaning that ‚Äúthey‚Äù had won. Weirdly enough it was weed that started giving me anxiety and I‚Äôve gone from being stable and self-confident af to experiencing the whole spectrum from panic attacks to bedridden for days because my mental health was so poor.

I think the best thing about quitting has been dreaming! I‚Äôve woken up in a euphoria from amazing dreams and I look forward to more, although I also expect nightmares which I had a lot last time I quit. I‚Äôm totally mentally prepared for this though since my dreams have always been such an important part of understanding myself and what is going on in my life. Do the nightmares usually take a time to occur, or do they usually happen early on after stopping?

Anyway since I haven‚Äôt got a great support network here apart from friends who, despite being understanding and amazing, probably doesn‚Äôt understand the struggles of being addicted to weed. I also have a partner and his family and friends but I hope it doesn‚Äôt sound too harsh but I feel they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmy‚Äù support network.

1. The obvious one, quarantine: I‚Äôve been so glad that I‚Äôve quitted during lockdown. Just not having the urge and the need of buying weed and risking my safety has brought me joy.
2. Social anxiety: it was a relief that if I was feeling awkward or in need of going home when around people it had nothing to do with weed. If I was acting weirdly, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm weird, not stoned.
3. Related to the previous one, feeling in change of my decisions and behavior.
4. Getting to say no: previously, I‚Äôd go with the flow, but now (even though I‚Äôm a yes person) I‚Äôm starting to be aware of what I want in my life and what I don‚Äôt.
5. Driving!!!: it was such a stressful situation for me just to know that every time I drove I would test positive. Now this fear is completely gone. 
6. Getting to do the things I like: I used to be very physically active and fond of drawing and creative stuff, but since I started smoking I started finding instant pleasure in the most boring unproductive stuff. Now I‚Äôm starting to draw, to exercise and, overall, to find new ways of entertainment and happiness that I‚Äôd never have bothered to search for before.

It alienated me from my family and made me disappear inside myself, but it had become a habit and occasionally I would have moments of clarity but I found that weed really made my memory bad so I don't tend to remember them.

Started in my mid teens. Grew my own for years. It provided some relief from inherited mental health issues, but I'm 100% done.

&nbsp;

I gave myself serious health problems and incurred ~$20k in medical bills over the years.

&nbsp;

6 years ago, I had a full-blown seizure while at the office, after going cold-turkey two days prior. Woke up in the ambulance. I now believe I gave myself that seizure. Immediately after the seizure, I resumed my consumption, despite suffering daily panic attacks and violent myoclonic jerks. I believed it was the only thing between me and another seizure. I was INCREDIBLY lucky to have a job where my boss permitted me to work remotely for a few months while I sorted out my health issues - otherwise there is no doubt I would have been let go.

&nbsp;

I ended up in the hospital AGAIN two weeks later, this time because I called 911 during a panic attack at home after toking (my systolic BP was over 200!!)

&nbsp;

Within a month I hit rock bottom. I could not sleep without the herb (and barely with it), and feared another seizure if I stopped. A psychiatrist put me on an anti-epileptic medication and told me ""there's no such thing as marijuana withdrawal"". With my brain stabilized on prescription medication, I got myself to stop toking for a few months, but eventually resumed simply because I was bored without the high. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

&nbsp;

I have sleep apnea and wake up choking. I have pretty bad acid reflux, which is a pain in the ass and worsens the apnea. I grind my teeth at night, so I wear a mouth guard. My blood pressure is all over the place, despite maintaining a high level of cardio and a healthy BMI. On top of all that, my focus, memory and motivation are shot, and I can barely do my tech job anymore. Social anxiety has always been severe, too.

&nbsp;

Since stopping, I haven't ground my teeth at all and stopped wearing my mouth guard. My reflux got worse for a few days, but has almost entirely stopped now.

I was gluing my throat shut with weed resin every evening, and irritating my esophageal sphincter. This caused apnea and reflux. DUH!

All seizure-related symptoms have disappeared! I might even work on getting off of the anti-epileptic in a few months.

I am still not sleeping well, anxiety is really high some days and absent other days (and I feel like I'll pass out all day), my skin is constantly itchy, and my muscles ache, but my health outlook is so, so much better. I'm dreaming again for the first time in years. I'm having a much easier time talking and relating with people. Strange paranoid thoughts are gone. I love it.

&nbsp;

I believe I did (hopefully reversible) damage to my brain, especially since I also severely deprived myself of sleep over the years. I limped my way to a reasonably successful life but I have caused myself needless suffering along the way, imagining that I was self-medicating the problems I was actually causing. Because I started so young and consumed it so continuously, I have no ""baseline""... I'm excited to find out what that is for me.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6859693}"

This is my first time posting on reddit ever, but I've been quietly reading r/leaves since I decided to quit 5 days ago. You guys rule.

I've been a daily smoker for 7+ years and like every stoner ever I've been saying I should quit for years. Now I finally feel strong / happy / secure enough to actually do it.

I've been having typical withdrawal symptoms (insomnia, night sweats, generally feeling like shit) which has all been manageable but having no appetite is proving to be a big issue. I already had some issues eating enough or eating anything with nutritional value before quitting, but I was at least able to eat some in the evenings while smoking. I take Adderall and I'm also living alone for the first time, which seems to make it harder to have the desire to eat or cook or grocery shop. 

The first 3 days were rough and I was barely able to eat at all. By the end of day 3 i felt soooo sick and miserable from not eating but food still sounded disgusting. I knew I wouldn't be able to eat. I allowed myself one toke and immediately felt hungry, and then after eating I felt so much better. 

The next day i didn't smoke, but I still felt good all day and actually was able to eat a big healthy dinner with no weed (yay!). Now its day 5 and im feeling yucky and hungry but not hungry again :/

Basically what I'm asking is:

1. Any tips for helping with appetite would be appreciated! I'm not mad at myself for smoking the other day but I don't want to end up so desperate that I feel like I HAVE to smoke again

2. If I reduce consumption to taking 1 toke every few days am I just setting myself up to repeat initial withdrawal symptoms every few days? Would I basically have to smoke a smaller amount daily first if I wanted to reduce before fully stopping? And is that why I felt good on day 4 but bad on day 5?
I know the majority of people here advocate for cold turkey which I get but I'd just like to understand / know my options:)",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.51407105}"

But, I feel pity that I wasn't able to control myself and completely banning weed for life is an overkill and missing opportunities for applying it in helpful ways. So for now, I've decided not to buy it but allow smoking it if somebody offers.

So the day has finally come , honestly I had so many things I wanted to write I‚Äôve been thinking about this day for the entirety of 2020 , thinking I‚Äôm gonna write so much and give so much advice and blah blah blah , but now that it‚Äôs here , I don‚Äôt feel up to it . 

Bizarrely the last few days where I knew this day was approaching I actually became a little sad and depressed and I honestly don‚Äôt know why , it should have been a day of celebration and I should have been excited but this weird melancholy fell over me . not enough to push me to use , but definitely enough to bring me down and alter my mood somewhat . 

I dunno , as a person who fully abused weed for the most part of 15 years I guess I should be happy as this is the first year since I was a teenager that I placed no carcinogens into my lungs . 

I guess the way that I feel is like this , I‚Äôve spoken to many many people through support groups and even read things on this subreddit about people having been clean from weed for many years and all it took was one relapse for them to end up right back in that hole and I guess that kinda scares me . 

1 year without weed is a great achievement nonetheless , especially for someone like me , who was the quintessential stoner for half
My life , but in a way I feel like this is only the beginning. 
I‚Äôm still very much in the Infant stages of my new life journey , and believe me my life has changed a whole lot in just the space of a year . 

I honestly can‚Äôt be bothered to list out all of these achievements but if you look through my post history you‚Äôll see most of them that I posted in my 7
Month update . 

in any case it‚Äôs great to have at-least one solid milestone under my belt . And if there‚Äôs one bit of advice I can offer it‚Äôs this , 

It‚Äôs taken me at-least 11 years to get to this stage . 
I‚Äôve lost count of how many times I‚Äôve ‚Äúquit‚Äù for good , to then relapse , I‚Äôve had months of sobriety under my belt in the past . but I could never get to a year . but I‚Äôve always known deep down inside that the way I was living was wrong , and through enough persistence , through all the tears , and sweaty nights , and violent mood swings and pangs of anxiety , and pink clouds I‚Äôve finally gotten myself to a year ! So just understand that relapses,  Many many of them can unfortunately be a part of the journey , but if you really want it deep down inside . Keep persisting no matter how emotionally exhausting it becomes . working on improving yourself is a noble endeavour . 

Here‚Äôs comes the big clich√® guys , if I can do it , anyone can . 

I know for sure that I‚Äôm not out of the woods yet ,  I still have to work on myself a lot , but for now I feel that on some level I‚Äôve finally regained a little bit more control of my life . And hopefully 1 year of sobriety from smoking weed can give me some more forward momentum . 

I‚Äôll be sending out positive energy into the universe for all of you in the struggle . 

always happy to speak to anyone struggling . 

I hope you all live long and prosper üññ

I have been quite well with the quitting process, I am not craving smoking at all but I am overwhelmed by this internal negativity and I am wondering if anyone experienced something similar?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7282721}"

There are a few things that almost got me that I want to bring up maybe someone will find it useful. So just to give you some context I've got quite bad PTSD, lots of angry outbursts and depression and so on... I use to smoke to chill myself out or feel good when I felt sad. However when I wasn't high I was still really angry, even worse than before sometimes and still depressed...  When I stopped smoking a few months in I was still getting angry and still getting depressed. I forgot that those things were there BEFORE THE WEED. I would try and trick myself saying ""whats the point in stopping smoking your still losing your temper just like you were when you were in the weed cycle"" Or ""your still unhappy it wasn't the weed after all might as well smoke"" I didn't smoke and what I learnt is this, your issues don't magically go away when you stop weed but fucking hell are you able to deal with it more effectively. I might lose my temper for a bit but then calm myself back down, before that was really hard. I might still get really depressed but instead of it lasting like 3 weeks its now like a few days then back to normal. I'm so much more functional, able to help myself and heal, able to deal with the downs and have more ups and middles than ever before.

So if you find your self annoyed your issues have not gone away remember weed was either masking or exacerbating those issues, if you keep smoking you wont be able to deal with them, if you stop you become empowered and better equipped to deal with your life issues.

You can do it! it's really not this impossible thing, if you're struggling to stop, write yourself a big list of reasons why you want to stop. Often if you can't do something you havn't quite got the motivation side of things down.

You are all awesome

I‚Äôd completely forgotten how much weed can affect your dreams, and honestly this experience has completely changed my outlook on it as a drug, if anything, *THIS* is the thing that has made me not want to go back to it the most. 

Not only was this dream emotionally exhausting, but I woke up in a state of complete confusion, anguish to some extent, and a lot of hurt from things I clearly haven‚Äôt been able to deal with. I‚Äôm a musician, and I‚Äôve had to work so hard to write lyrics and music etc. for the past... 3, 4 years? I‚Äôve always said that smoking weed increases my creativity as it allows me to zone out and not focus on things, but it‚Äôs completely the opposite. I can‚Äôt believe how wrong I was, and I‚Äôm so so so relieved that this has happened. As soon as I woke up I managed to write an entire set of lyrics and it just flowed straight out, the first time that‚Äôs happened in years, it felt amazing. 

I feel like 6 days is nothing to celebrate too much, but I‚Äôm taking each day as it comes, going from smoking pretty much all day every day, to smoking nothing at all has been tough, but honestly I already feel like I can get my life back on track. 

Anyone who‚Äôs just starting out, or isn‚Äôt sure whether they can take that leap and quit, it‚Äôs so so worth it, trust me.

Let me explain, when I smoked I was up all night binge eating. My sleep sucked and it was one of the main reasons why I quit.

But then I watched over my habits, I still stayed up incredibly late and around 2am I always got hungry and ate. I started sleeping with my phone in another room and sure it sucked that first night, but I fell asleep earlier and had THE BEST sleep in a very long time. Ever since my sleep has been incredibly good, that sort of sober sleep you dream of when always high! To this day there is a small voice  that tells me to watch YouTube every time I go to bed, but I say no and sleep like a baby.

I smoked maybe twice before, but never really saw the appeal until I was surrounded by friends that were already potheads or became a pothead like myself. I went about 3.5 years of smoking every day; mainly geebs too. I didn‚Äôt really have the money for anything else and god knows what the plastic has done to my lungs. I took a break for the first time in late May 2020. I was becoming very depressed and very anxious. Weed has definitely changed me from the rule following motivated kid that I was in high school. My main motivation for quitting the first time was to perform well for a summer internship I had gotten. I realized quickly how much better I felt in terms of energy and motivation; however I was very anxious, which I think stems from the withdrawals of not smoking. 

I did well over this past summer with not smoking. I realized that weed had actually set me back essentially 3.5 years in terms of social development, happiness, and self esteem. I unfortunately made the fatal mistake of celebrating the end of my internship by smoking. This was the dumbest thing I could do. Total relapse. Spent the next 4 months getting high every single day. I ended up falling back into my weed spiral and lost my grip on what is actually important in life. I ended up having to drop three college courses because of how poorly I was performing. I think this was due to my extreme lack of motivation caused by smoking. How foolish of me to know what is best for me and my mental health, but to not have the mental strength to break my disgusting habit before it was too late. 

The last time I was high was Christmas night. Of course it physically felt good, but I felt so overwhelmingly guilty and so much anxiety came rushing over me. I then decided it was time for me to stop smoking again, and this time maybe for good. My issue now is that I am not feeling the same pride and jubilation I felt after taking my first break from weed back in May. This is frustrating to me because that‚Äôs what I feel is the best part of quitting. Regardless, I will carry on and contribute not to smoke, but goddamn these cravings really sneak up on me and especially at night.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5689669}"

I ingested mostly with flower and once in a great while low dose edibles, topicals and tinctures. Before Jan. 2020, I was not a cannabis consumer at all. 

I have found that it's not all that it was purported to be. The hype around the ""medicinal"" benefits didn't live up to my expectations. I initiated getting a state card because I wanted access to legal, regulated and tested products. What I found instead was inconsistent products, ineffective pain relief and many days lost to laziness and forgetfulness. 

Before having major surgery in June of 2018, I did 3 months of intense physical therapy for my back. I've had facet blocks and a RFA in my lumbar spine. I continue to do my therapy exercises at home and I take Ibuprofen and Tylenol. Some days I can walk and there are others when I simply can't do more than shower, dress myself and eat. 

My physical pain is very real and the chronic PTSD lurks in the background as a minor nuisance at this point. My therapist is fabulous and has helped me sort through my trauma. She's truly worth her weight in gold.

For me, the cost alone is a major issue of discontent. Since I am unemployed due to my mental and physical issues, my fiance has been paying for this entire ordeal for a year. He doesn't mind footing the bill, but I don't like him doing that. 

There are many layers to this ugly cake but my point is that I'm simply disenchanted with being high. It does nothing for my pain and I was foolish for trying all kinds of products hoping for better results each time.

Hopefully I can achieve something meaningful to myself this year if not just clarity on my life. The limitations I find myself dealing with are tough and medical marijuana didn't ease them at all. Here's to new beginnings, clarity and endurance.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.71083885}"

I have been afraid of dying every night since mid december, panic and anxiety got worse on CHristmas vacations so i finally decided to quit the Mary Jane.

as Day 5 approaches i have been experiencing dizziness, headache, palpipations and a sense of being behind a glass. My main concern is not giving up and falling for it again but its being able to understand my sypmtoms.  
One thing i can say is that smoking regoular rolled cigarettes kind of helps, but most importantly doing phisical activities.

So I‚Äôm on day 7 (well it‚Äôs the middle of the night my time right now, so day 7/8 whatever you wanna call it). I‚Äôve smoked weed basically everyday for over 11 years (started when I was 19, I‚Äôm 31 now). Finally decided to quit after a long, long battle with depression. Finally in a much better place mentally after two courses of Cognitive and Behavioural Therapy last year, and decided now was the right time to finally quit. (Only took a fucking decade üòÇ)

Today has been, quite frankly, fucking shit. I‚Äôve felt like absolute trash all day, irritable, pissed off, down, and generally not good. I blew up at my best friend over messenger about some stupid petty bullshit (I apologised profusely later and luckily it seems he understood and forgave me). Today has been without a doubt the worst day since day 3. 

But guess what? I didn‚Äôt smoke. I didn‚Äôt text my dealer. And for the first time in a long time I actually feel somewhat proud of myself (don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm pretty appalled at my behaviour regarding my friend, hopefully I‚Äôll be able to control myself better in the future). 

I still feel like shit and I would fucking love a spliff right now, but I feel I can honestly say I‚Äôm doing my best.

So basically I‚Äôm just sort of posting this as a reminder to myself that I CAN do this. And I realise it probably won‚Äôt, but if this makes even one person in the same position as me think twice about picking up, or smoking, then, well, hopefully that‚Äôs worth something, I dunno ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Anyway my point (which admittedly I sort of lost there üòÇ) is that I can do this. And so can you. If you‚Äôve made the decision to quit recently, or you‚Äôve been clear for a long time but are finding it hard, you can do this. 

As you can probably tell from this I‚Äôm still in what is probably a quite severe stages of withdrawal, and that there are certainly harder days ahead. But I need to make a promise to myself, in writing, that I will try my absolute best. And if I slip up, which hopefully I won‚Äôt but I guess you never know, then I will start again at day 0, and try my best again. 

Best of luck to you all, stay clear, you can do it.

However, I‚Äôve wanted to quit smoking for a while. I recognized that being a stoner and being high all the time was holding me back from reaching my true potential. But quitting is hard when you‚Äôre addicted and dependent on it. I‚Äôve tried to quit dozens of times and never made it even a single day. You know how it goes. 

Now that that‚Äôs all taken care of, I feel like I have no reason not to smoke. I can smoke wherever and whenever I want both at home and at school. No more looming drug test, no more stigma, none of that. 

Except, I don‚Äôt want to. 

Being clean and sober and truly present has been really nice. Not having anything to hide is nice. Not having to hide being high all the time is nice. Not having to risk a DUI every time I drive is nice. Not even to mention all the money I‚Äôve saved. 

It‚Äôs been such a positive lifestyle change. My diet has always been good but since quitting it‚Äôs been great. I‚Äôm back on the workout grind heavy and I‚Äôm looking and feeling great. I‚Äôm finally back to being myself, and back on my quest of becoming the best version of myself. 

Weed really took a toll on me mentally and had me trapped. I was one of those ‚Äúfunctioning stoners‚Äù aka I was high so often that I got too good at hiding it. Weed can be very deceptive and addictive. It played with my mindset and mental state and had me convinced ‚ÄúI was a better version of myself when I was high‚Äù and all that. That‚Äôs a whole other story tho. 

Quitting is hard but it‚Äôs not impossible. The first step is always the hardest. The urge will always be there but with time resisting it gets easier. Not to sound cliche but if I can quit then so can any of you. 

First milestone of a never ending journey. Never thought I‚Äôd get here. 

Trust the process. Godspeed leavers.",18,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.679366}"

I guess my reason for smoking in the first place was out of boredom. My parents had split up and I chose to live with my mom mainly because I was closer to her and I had more freedom with her, and she was more financially stable than my dad. Starting my sophomore year of high school, I was using lunch money that I got from my mom and buying weed either with my friends or on my own and smoking after school. My mom worked a lot too, so I was able to meet up with my friends and smoke a lot or just smoke at the house when she wasn‚Äôt home. I was smoking every day. Still am to this day in my late twenties...I just graduated college and I am about to start my career that I have been working so hard for. I‚Äôve still been smoking/vaping/taking edibles daily, but I still managed to finish school because I had already fucked up once before. I start a paid internship tomorrow and so far there has been no mention of a drug test. Pretty soon I will be leaving this internship for a permanent position at a different company that I have been dreaming of working, where I know for sure I will be drug tested and I cannot risk losing everything I worked so hard for over weed. It has been good to me and it has so many benefits but at this point in my life, it no longer serves me any purpose. I‚Äôve quit a few times before, longest I made was a couple months. But this time it has to be for good. Tbh I don‚Äôt even think I get high anymore. I just get numb to boredom and the shit I don‚Äôt want to think about. If I‚Äôm going back and forth to my shed every 2 hours to feel something like that, then it‚Äôs not worth feeling at all. It‚Äôs time for me to enjoy life organically. Not through the means of a plant or substance, but through my hard work and meaningful experiences and meaningful people. I‚Äôm about to start receiving blessings in so many avenues of my life because of my accomplishments last year, that weed and getting high are going to be the least of my concerns. I can‚Äôt be living my life like this anymore. Sneaking around my loved ones to smoke. Feeling unmotivated now that school is over. Feeling lazy. Feeling unsociable, especially to my loved ones. I hate feeling dependent/addicted to this thing that doesn‚Äôt serve me in any way. It‚Äôs so lame that as soon as I come across some money, the first thing I think about is going to the dispensary. That‚Äôs so lame. I‚Äôm above that. I can‚Äôt be in that mindset anymore. Especially with this career I‚Äôm heading into. I‚Äôve never had a job that paid more than $14/hr and I was throwing away 60% of that on weed, 30% on munchies, and the other 10% on gas to go get said weed and munchies. If I‚Äôm still thinking like this in the future, I‚Äôm going to be blowing A LOT of money on weed and that‚Äôs just ridiculous. Also I just need to be in a focused mindset because the career calls for it. I can‚Äôt be high every day if I truly want this. I know some people in the field who can indulge every once in a while, but knowing me, I would just get right back into this vicious cycle again if I tried to go for moderation. Anyway, I know this is all over the place but I‚Äôm just venting and expressing my determination to quit. I don‚Äôt need weed. I don‚Äôt need to be high.

Looking for some reassurance on my path.,"I'm at a stage now where a lot of my withdrawal symptoms are fairly mild and mostly just irritating at this point, but still worry me to an extent. Maybe it's because I'm a bit impatient and just want to be 'normal' again, but I'm still learning that this is my new normal now and that I have essentially changed parts of myself since quitting smoking altogether and coming to terms with adapting to those changes. Some days are better than others to say the least! 

Even though my stint of smoking joints was short lived compared to other journeys I've read in this group (was a chronic joint smoker for a solid 9 months last year from morning to night most days when I wasn't working, and generally on/off the last few years), I still got the full force of weed withdrawal symptoms within the first week: high anxiety, weight loss, no appetite, little to no sleep, clammy hands, tinnitus, headaches, the works. Then the vivid dreams & nightmare dropped in and made my sleep worse, the ringing in my ears would spike often and I genuinely thought I was losing the plot. Like the brain in my head wasn't my own.

Despite the above, time has passed and I am a lot better than I was 7 weeks ago. My only worries now is that the tinnitus is still present and the head tension is also lingering (which I knew were possible symptoms anyway). Some days I focus on it without meaning to and it gets me down, others I just phase it out.

I'd just like some reassurance for anyone that has had similar or ongoing experiences with the tinnitus and head tension when quitting; what's the average time scale for these symptoms to go away, and do they ever go away? Me being me, I'm a worry wart and sometimes the smallest of things can peck at me üòÖ A note as well, is that my ears are perfectly fine after having them checked by a doctor, no damage or history of tinnitus ever until I quit smoking.

I'm new here, and delighted to have come across this community when searching online for tips to help with quitting weed.

I'm a 25 year old male,and have been smoking regulary for the past 3 years, and heavily every day for the last year. I'm wanting to quit as I want to return to the person I was before I started smoking weed.

I have been dealing with anxiety, a minor emotional disorder and bouts of depression since I was 15. When I first started smoking weed it completely got rid of my anxiety, increased my creativity which massively helped with my line of work and made mevery sociable. I have always been high functioning regradless of anxiety, depression etc, but now weed does the complete opposite for me. I am withdrawn, unmotivated, stagnant and have lost my fight and spark for life.

I have noticed also how weed has exccerbated my escapist mindsets which is not helping currently with my country being in lockdown for almost a year now. I haveny worked at all other than two months last year, as my line of work is hugely impacted with lockdows, so weed has become a massice crutch for me. I smoke because it takes me away from reality, and lets me live in this dreamy headspace where I feel like I am in other places on my daily cycling adventures, however this mindset is taking over and I need to quit while I'm ahead. I feelmy cognitive abilties have been majorly affected. I'm also wondering if other people have experienced the social anxiety and awkwardness, I cannot sit comfortably in silence with other people, it feels incredibly tense and awkward, I also second guess eveything I say and I misinterpret peoples actions and words, and have also become quite paranoid, all of these things I have never experienced prior to smoking weed, has anyone experienced this, and does this go away when you fully quit?

I would love some nutritional, physical and mental tips to help with quitting, and others thoughts and advices in general would be hugely appreciated :)

First post here but I‚Äôve been reading the conversations for a while.  I‚Äôm hoping that this Community becomes a helpful part of my recovery effort.  

I am 33 and I‚Äôve been smoking for 15 years.  For 13 or 14 years I‚Äôve been smoking every day, typically multiple times.  I‚Äôve always known that I would be better off without weed in my life and I know that I don‚Äôt want to be a pothead forever (especially when I become a dad in the near future).  In the last couple years I‚Äôve tried quitting 7-10 times, and every time I‚Äôve cracked within the first week.  I‚Äôm a strong willed person, but my motivation to quit pot comes and goes which I think has been the biggest blocker to getting clean.  I have a college degree, a great job, and I‚Äôm successful in my career by just about any measure.  My therapist is amazed at how quickly I‚Äôve moved up the corporate ladder, but he‚Äôs warned me that eventually my pot habit may hinder my career (I believe im beginning to experience this at work).  I‚Äôve never had many friends and I‚Äôm an introvert, but I know that my relationships with friends/family would be more plentiful and richer if I wasn‚Äôt getting high all the time.

In the last year I‚Äôve begun consuming more pot than ever and it seems harder to quit than it would have been in the past.  Recently I‚Äôve been smoking 2-4 grams a day.

I‚Äôm ashamed of my drug habit and the repeated failures to overcome this have made me a lot less confident that I can/will eventually be pot free.  

Last night, I finished off the last joint in my possession and I plan for today to be the first day at the rest of my life without weed.  Today this sounds like a great idea, but I know that once the work week gets underway and I‚Äôve had a couple sleepless nights that urge to smoke will come back.  This is usually when I stumble.

I could use some encouragement from others here who understand my struggles.  Any advice that may help me avoid slipping up in the future would be helpful as well.  Thank you üôè",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45706996}"

Started smoking 4 - 5 years ago, and since then ive been smoking everyday multiple times a day. Its always been a social activity with my friends, and that kinda normalized it for me, and after a while i started to smoke alone. I would smoke to avoid personal responsibilities and problems, and that led to me getting expelled from college. I spent a year working and smoking pretty heavy (went trough a bunch of shitty warehouse jobs which were hard on my body and really boring, so weed was a way to relax at the end of the day). I also have a nightmare problem since i was a child, and weed helped a lot with that since weed blocks dreams (for me at least). Now im about to come back to college, i knew i had to stop. Theres was a particular moment that really opened my eyes. I went to my girlfriends house for new years, and spent 3 days at her house. Her parents are eastern europeans so they are really against weed, so whenever I would visit them i would leave my stash at home and smoke before going there. So its new years eve, and for the whole 3 days that ive been there i wasn‚Äôt able to eat since i wansnt smoking. I forced myself in front of her parents, and then would quietly go puke it up in the bathroom. When i came back home i immediately smoked and ate since i hadn‚Äôt eaten in 3 days. Its been an uphill battle since then, but after after a couple days of smoking 1 time per day i am finally able to eat without smoking. Now im on day 2, and everynight i have weird fever dreams, and because of the lockdown my biggest problem right now is boredom. Weed makes any activity more fun, and i miss that but im not going back. Anyway i just wanted to vent, and if anyone has some advice i would appreciate that.

I‚Äôm 27 F. I left my home country 6.5 years ago. I was alone ever since. Did my studies and currently have a very decent job. I always wanted to try weed but have never seen myself as the addict i am now. I started smoking cigarettes at a very young age (12 yo). I started smoking 1 joint a day maybe 5 years ago, and haven‚Äôt stopped since. I can now easily smoke 6g per day. I love the fog, i love that it makes me forget the past and the future and just focus on the now. I‚Äôve had an ok childhood, but i was molested many times, and i didn‚Äôt have much friends, but if people made the first step towards me i would easily give whatever i have from emotions. 
I have never seen a therapist, and i now believe that weed was my therapist.
Now that i realized how much money I‚Äôve spent on weed, i feel so bad and guilty. My parents are not that rich, and they lost all their money because of political and bank problems back at home. I now found myself an addict that has to support her family. 
I also have done harder drugs (mdma) but not much of a fan and i once got 3 acid tabs from a friend, that i took all at once and it was my first time (yes, stupid, i know)
Also i live in a country where weed is not decriminalized but quite easy to get.
I tried to stop weed multiple times, but whenever i do i remember all the piled up grief and sadness that i never dealt with properly, and start thinking about my uncertain future that I‚Äôm sure will include so many problems. 
I feel so sad, i can‚Äôt even eat anything, and i have to get my nicotine, so i end being so sick by the end of the day that i throw out whatever acid i have in my stomach.
I can‚Äôt get myself to do sports or go out, my brain just wants to sit there and be miserable.

I‚Äôm on my day 2 now, and I‚Äôm hating myself way too much for becoming that all sweaty drug craving person. But I‚Äôm trying.

All those years just constantly figuring out the best way to light up, all the effort, the excessive thinking and planning. Wondering why it never felt as good as I imagined. How sad that is, to make all those effort to get the perfect high, and killing my high with the overthinking and disappointment. 

What‚Äôs the best joy in life? Surprising contentment of the present moment. Either it‚Äôs walking down an unfamiliar street with a new vibe, stumbling upon a cool alleyway between two rustic buildings, an unexplored hiking trail presenting a lake under a small water fall out of the blue where you can‚Äôt help to think: quoting Vonnegut ‚ÄúIf this isn‚Äôt nice, I don‚Äôt know what is.‚Äù 

Weed took all that away from me, for all those years. How come? Because I was busy of futile attempts to plan myself joyful moments, so busy that I constantly missed out the actual moments of life. You cannot plan a surprise. You must learn to embrace the uncertainties, and let the joy come as a surprise.",31,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.41488457}"

I've been testing the idea of quitting for about 2 years now and I have stumbled across this community many times, always feeling inspired, but ashamed to join because I don't trust I'll follow through. 

My problem is I feel envious of people who can enjoy a casual toke, without feeling the need to light up the second and third joint and continue the next day. I'd love it if I had the will power some people have of exclusively smoking at night, or occasionally smoking a joint on a slow sunday, unfortunately, I've realized that's just not me, I've gone a month without smoking, then I buy a gram and promise myself that I'll smoke up once, enjoy it and go back to it when I find the right time again and I just end up relapsing and craving a  second joint the next day in the morning and it becomes a habit once more. To top it all off, I live in Amsterdam and I love the smell of weed and coffee when biking past the shops and that makes it twice as difficult, I also envy the will-power dutch smokers have, they've always had access to weed whenever they want, so they're not wired to smoke as much as they can whenever they can, they also spend less money because they mix it with tobacco, I realized my brain is wired to smoke all the time because when I began I was 17, I did it without my parent's consent and I always wanted to take advantage of any chance I had to smoke weed because it wasn't found easily. Now I have weed available in each corner yet my brain doesn't adjust to that, it's still wired to think it might be the last time in a long time.

Anyways... I've realized I'm screwing my life up, I have a scholarship in a great school through which I found a scholarship for student housing and I'm not taking advantage of these opportunities to the fullest, I'm very scared one day I'll be a dropout and I'll regret smoking up all day instead of grinding for a good job. My girlfriend (5-year relationship) is threatening to leave me because she is noticing my lack of motivation and says she wants someone who wants to achieve something in life, I get angry when she brings it up sometimes but I know she's totally right, she doesn't link it with my weed use though because she also smokes but she only does it occasionally and it's a not a problem for her so she doesn't suspect this is eating me up inside. I know for certain I've left her hanging sexually too, she wants to get it on many times when I'm not in the mood because I'm simply way too lethargic for sex, she has given me one last chance to do well in school and become a better person and this has motivated me to quit... reading through this I wrote down I can see clearly how much of an idiot I have been.... I have a great career opportunity, I am not paying rent because the school saw potential in me, my girlfriend is very good looking and has an awesome body (when we were younger I felt we were a great match, I was handsome, but I've aged a bit, gained some weight and started balding and if I'm totally honest I feel she's way way better looking than me now) and I feel it's all slowly slipping from my fingertips because I'm being a lazy stupid pot-head. Hopefully, I'll come back to this post and realize how stupid it would be to start smoking again when I know it's a problem.

20 + year smoker off and on (mostly on). 
Day 1-3 generally felt fine. A bit of sweating.
Day 4- major panic attack, lots of sweating (hot and cold sweats), felt like I couldn‚Äôt eat anything- nausea and stomach tension. 
Day 5-6 anxiety mid afternoon each day, hot and cold sweats, super vivid dreams, appetite was up and down
Day 7-8 ‚ÄúPink cloud‚Äù- had energy, felt great about quitting, motivated and read and did work, sweating majorly cut down. 

Since then (am now on day 14) I have had intermittent sweating (no longer soaking clothes and just hot sweats, no cold sweats), heart palpitations, and major headaches. Dreams are vivid but am sleeping fine except for waking up at 2 am for a bit every night.

I experience like an hour or two each day where I feel great and motivated and healthy and clear... and then I get waves of nausea. I am realizing that so much of my smoking was around appetite and food and now I don‚Äôt know when I am hungry, or what to eat. Nothing looks good.

The positives are that my anxiety is way down (I got to the point where flower was causing anxiety issues)

Mainly I am feeling stuck at a place where I have absolutely no desire to smoke but I don‚Äôt feel like the positives and like the struggles I have gone through the past few weeks are worth it yet.

I don‚Äôt want to do anything. Even tv is boring. I can‚Äôt go anywhere and each day around 2 pm feel a sense of anxiety and loneliness and discouragement. I am sick of headaches and sweating and the random waves of nausea. I read in here all the time that people feel wonderful after a week or two and I am admittedly a bit jealous. I don‚Äôt feel like my ‚Äúold self‚Äù whatever that was. I just try to get through each day and enjoy the hour or two of feeling good I get.

Longest I quit was a year in 2017.  I‚Äôve relapsed so many times bjt ive also quit many times anywhere from 4-6/7months at a time.  The difference in my self esteem, productivity, accomplishments, clarity, etc is startling. The long stint off cannabis and alcohol (not really addicted to that but I found whenever I‚Äôd start drinking even occasionally - I always felt Mary was ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù and so in due time I‚Äôd find myself justifying smoking as a a healthier ‚Äúvice‚Äù and end up toking up again so i usually quit both for that reason). Anyway..... that year of sobriety taught me a lot of things.  A healthy routine is essential and is what got me so
Far. I‚Äôd wake up at 5am everyday and do yoga, meditate/pray, read/write, hit the gym/sauna, and dance all before 11am. With time I fell into a groove and for the first time in my life (I was in my late 20s) I experienced what it was like to feel
High on life.  I never knew that was possible. I felt SO good that when all my
Roomates toked up around me constantly or offered me drinks... it never phased me because I was certain it would actually bring me down. And I could plainly see what how their addictions were wrecking havoc with their lives and aspirations and I wanted no part of it. What caused me to relapse was travelling out of the country and being in the midst of a breakup (6 year relationship) and basically shit hitting the fan all at once.  I also had no mentor or sponsor/support and at the time I was not going to meetings. 

Anyway. Really happy for what the future will hold. I know it‚Äôs going to be journey and I can‚Äôt say for sure if I will quit forever. Life has humbled me that way.  But each relapse has taught me a lot. This last time my... it stemmed from the fact that I was grieving the loss of my bunny right before Christmas and had no real emotional support... and was out of balance between work/rest.

2021-01-10 01:30:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ku985m/suggestions_on_how_to_start/,Suggestions on how to start?,"Hello, everybody. For the past nine years or so I‚Äôve been heavily into smoking pot. I guess I should start from the beginning.

I was introduced to it harmlessly enough; during my high school days I ended up with a girl who dabbled with it frequently. This was a big problem for me initially.. I can still recall multiple occasions where I was uncomfortable with her usage and this led to many arguments. Somewhere along the line I ended up getting into it myself as a means of remedying the arguing, to ease the situation. Fast forward a couple of years and the habit has stuck. Let me say that I absolutely do not blame this girl for my own actions and that isn‚Äôt what this post is about. I do ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù smoking weed, I have for many years now, but I‚Äôve been wanting to kick this habit for multiple reasons. 

Smoking dope has followed, haunted, me since then. That relationship has ran its course (for years now) and yet the habit has remained. Hell, it‚Äôs caused problems for me in future relationships that I‚Äôve been in that have come and gone since then. I guess in a sense, I‚Äôve made this post because I don‚Äôt know how to start quitting.

I have a BA in English and minored in historical studies. Coming out of high school, my goal was to become a teacher myself - to ensure that students were properly prepared for the transition from high school to university (I struggled with this transition myself, and it has always been my primary motivation when it comes to wanting to teach). If I had to be 100% honest, my degree on its own hasn‚Äôt helped me in the slightest when it comes to employment. For the last couple years I feel that I‚Äôve been spinning my wheels, working jobs geared towards customer service, (on that note, given my current experience within this field it makes me have the utmost appreciation for those on the other side of the counter) partly due to the fact that I‚Äôm living in an area that provides little to no economic security long term. 

My New Years‚Äô resolution has been to quit pot and get a better job for myself in order to pay off my current student loans and achieve my initial aspirations. The problem is how can I start? It‚Äôs become such a fixture in my every day life and I know that sounds somewhat pathetic but it‚Äôs the truth. 

Honestly? The thing that makes it sink in most is the holidays. When you catch up with family and friends yet you have nothing to say for yourself. It hurts to see everybody else moving forward but you yourself are not.

I thank anybody who took the time to read this, seriously. I‚Äôm just looking for any sort of suggestions on how to get started. I want to get back to how I was before all of this (minus the condescending attitude towards smoking, of course) And for further context, I‚Äôm sitting on an ounce that I just do not want at the moment.

Well I‚Äôve changed my thought pattern on this, and freed myself from my guilt and shame.

Yes I believe my weed addiction will be lifelong and something I will have to fight forever, but it‚Äôs not something I did to myself. I think it‚Äôs more accurate (and emotionally easier) to think of it like an allergy. My brain was pre-wired to be sensitive to THC addiction. The trend was wired in long before I ever took my first hit. The same way a person can be born with a peanut allergy, without ever tasting a single peanut. It‚Äôs something deadly that you have to live your life around and always be mindful of, but it‚Äôs not something that you willfully created. I didn‚Äôt do it to myself, my genetics set me up for failure! Simple as that. This thought has helped me to get through a lot of negative emotions, and to stop dwelling on my poor past decisions.

This thought also helps me to prepare for the future. Allergies don‚Äôt ever go away, you just have to be proactive and take steps to live your life safely around them. It‚Äôs the same with this addiction. Plenty of people have completely normal lives while living with deadly allergies, and I will also have a normal life living with my addiction. It just takes a little extra strategizing, but I‚Äôm telling you right now, I firmly believe a normal, fulfilling life is easily possible.

It was supposed to be day10, but I caved. Never in 4 years have I been off smoking for this long.
I quit tabacco and weed, and it was hard going, but nice.

Today started rough, with headaches and bad tempers.
At work I did alot, and at lunch I was feeling alot better. The headache slowly lessended and I was stoked to be hosting an online RPG with two good friends and my little nephew. I really wanted to impress my nephew as he could really use this kind of hobby and also impress my friends.

So as work was finished and everyone was closing the shop; my boss, and also my dad, came to me telling me I made a huge mistake with a customers motorcycle (I work in a motorcycle garage). He did not really want to kick me down and let me off easy. But it was bad

I was so bummed out and mad at my own dumbass mistake. It really blew my mood and motivations.
I considered alot of actions/moves. One of which was cancelling my plans for tonight and just smoke my problems away on some fucking bench in the cold.

I decided at home to call the only person I really trust to understand me to go through some of the shit thats bothering me, and it was great. Rarely done that
It felt really good to get that shit off my chest, and I felt ok.

The night went great; better then I expected. We played from 19:00 till 00:45 non-stop and we had a blast.

At 1am I was writing some of the stuff we did ingame on my computer for future games   and out of the blue I just decided to see what I had left in my stash. I smoked it. I feel bad. I may have drunk a little bit too much as well. Since I started smoking weed I turned into a bit of a lightweight with alcohol. I bow drink every night, just a few beers and some tea with a snip of liqour

I feel so weak. Even though I feel like I accompliced so much through alot of 'struggle'; with a huge pay-off without smoking; I still decided to smoke.

First time posting, but I feel like I really want to quit for good this time. I don't really need it. I just felt I needed alittle bit more.
I guess I just don't wanna sleep. I don't want to think about it. Its probably better if I did. Goodnight

One of my main difficulties through my adventure of quitting cannabis is the immense cravings, as noticed more due to my brain fog slowly disappearing,  I realised that boredom and stress was a massive trigger for me and oh boy the cravings had me wondering if I was still able to function without it, I carried out the usual procedures after that, contacting my dealer and picking up a smoke! 

On the way back I had a immense feeling of disappointment and disgust, and wondered how I've managed to come this close and failed again! I smoked half a joint and chucked the rest away and decided to look into ways of keeping my overactive brain busy! 

Does anyone have any tips to deal with the cravings? 
Or hobbies to keep my mind occupied at home?

The lack of motivation is unreal, along with the cravings I find these my biggest obstacles; but now I'm aware I feel like I can work on those certain issues! üíé",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.84808445}"

I feel like I'm finally past the hump of giving up weed. I no longer want to smoke as it now only makes me feel awful on so many levels. Anxiety, depression, feeling like a loser really. 

Giving up for good is good timing really as I start a new job at the beginning of February & don't want to be monged out for that. 

I have no real will to smoke or drink alcohol which is great but shit guys, I'm bored as hell. This painful, ever-present virus has thrown my country back into a lockdown so I've spent the last week mostly in bed watching youtube videos & working on a couple of projects.

Looking back to 2020, I was pretty much in the same situation as now. Sure I've grown and evolved in many ways, but I haven't progressed on from weed yet--which is something I'm now about to do in 2021.

In 2020, I think I had a solid 4 months of sobriety from weed, and 6 months of smoking. I feel pretty dumb for picking up the MJ again after being sober for so long. I guess I just thought that I can control it this time, that I won't take it as far as I've done before and hurt myself by slowly spiraling down into a hole of shame, pity, lethargy, hedonism.

If I were to now smoke, I would probably get the 5minutes ""oh wow I'm high"" come-up, and then greedily keep smoking more, trying to be SUPER HIGH (never happends with tolerance btw). Eventually, I will be too stoned to do much, and I will just sit on the computer watching same old youtube videos in an attempt to be entertained and enjoy myself. Actually: I would like to do something useful, but when I'm high, usually I don't have the energy, or I tell myself ""I can't bother to do X right now""

I honestly have felt depressed, because I feel like I can't get stuff done, I have trouble striving towards anything, and I isolate myself from others, because of the shame and guilt of smoking. It's like I don't know the reason why I am alive and I'm just ""comfortably numb"" in this dark spiral that I perpetuate by buying more weed. And when I buy weed, I sometimes literally feel like I hate myself for a little bit, but then tell myself ""This was the last time, I have to quit"". (wonder how many times I've thought that)

I've been quitting / trying to quit weed for about 1,5 years now. The best, most calm, most confident and at ease I've felt, have been the periods I've managed to quit for more than a few days. I've however only had 2 major breaks (more than 2-3 weeks), always falling back to weed cus a friend (or group) is smoking. Tbh it's sad, I don't really have many 'sober' friends. I wish I did though.

And so, slowly I'm coming to the realisation that I don't particularly even enjoy weed anymore. All it does, is make me fake-happy for a little bit and then anxious and sometimes VERY self-critical. In the back of my mind, I always know that I do not actually want to smoke, and that it's harmful to aspects in my life--holding me back.

Is it really a loss to quit weed? Am I actually going to LOSE something??

What if quitting opens up possibilities and allows change to happen? I mean, things don't just happen by themselves of course, but first we have to be open for change. Staying in the groundhogs day of smoking-> waking up in regret and dread like: ""oh well... it's another day-> probably gonna smoke later"" and going through the usual thing; is not going to open you up to experiencing something else.

*""It seems like every day's the same*

*And I'm left to discover on my own*

*It seems like everything is gray,*

*and there's no color to behold""*

It's always when I'm reaching the rock-bottom in addiction when I relate to these lyrics by Seether, when nothing makes sense, when I've been living the same day over and over and I'm tired of it. I am honestly, honestly so bored when I smoke. I'm mostly alone, on the pc, eating or doing nothing and I'm really beginning to be done. Maybe I will look at this post when I get an urge and realise, it never makes me feel any better whether I smoke, but it has the potential of bringing me down so much. Keep going fellas, it is worth it to be sober, to discover yourself.

Wish me luck guys. I want to make 2021 a good year, something I can look back at thinking:

Must have started when me and my friends lived together and we'd started and had a great time.

I was getting my stuff online and more and more i've been regretting how little drive I have, I found a video I made 9 years ago talking about the same thing and i've come to realize it wasn't weed that caused it but it allowed me to get through it.

Over Christmas i'd ran out, I tried everything to get some more and got really pissed off when I couldn't. Over the next 5 days I was thinking (and I had been thinking it on and off for 3 years) when was the last time I had a smoke and actually felt good? The buzz had completely gone I was just doing it to pass the time and boredom, but I didn't think i'd ever just stop it seemed like an impossible task for some reason.

I didn't want to make it a new year's resolution and when my Mrs suggested dry January I said I don't  want to but I won't smoke for the month, she happily agreed (Not accommodating to it at all haha).

&#x200B;

I don't have any drive back but I was getting so stressed out with struggling to remember pretty much anything from my childhood and most of my 20s. Every time I smoked I was constantly paranoid any bang in the house was someone getting in, or her coming home early and giving me shit for smoking it became the opposite of what i'd wanted, a big stress and a habit I was having to hide.

&#x200B;

The stuff i'd gotten online was judged by everyone there to be amazing stuff but honestly it didn't have that effect on me and I started thinking maybe I just have a high tolerance or maybe, i'm just not enjoying it anymore.

&#x200B;

The first few days were annoying, constantly snapping, grinding my teeth, rolling my eyes at everything. The first 2 weeks I had awful sleeps, I was getting between 4-6 hours a night not being able to switch off and as soon as I woke up at like 3am I was switched on and couldn't sleep again.

But now it's been 3 weeks and honestly I don't miss it at all. I think the fact that the quality of stuff i've had the past few years has helped and the fact that I couldn't get any forced me to look at it with sober eyes.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the essay I just wanted to write it down in case anyone's thinking of quitting. I'll tell you that if you still have some you're a lot less likely to stop.

&#x200B;

Now some questions, i've heard it'll take 6 months or so to be fully out my system before I can start ""Feeling normal again"" but honestly I don't even know what that means, do I start feeling more active, less paranoid, less reserved, does my memory improve? 

Next, I honestly don't think i'm going to relapse as such. Despite it being a habit and smoking so frequently I don't really feel any different and I don't feel dependent on it, but what if I do want to have a smoke once every few months with the lads (When all this is over) and not buy my own personal stash, has anyone been able to do that without going back to their old ways?

&#x200B;

Also, if I was to have a smoke with my friends once every say 4 months or so am I essentially resetting the 'getting it out my system' counter? I was thinking I have my stag do (Hopefully) the end of 2021 if everything's back on and I feel like we're going to the Netherlands and if i'm there i'd definitely have a smoke of some actual quality stuff but I want to be able to enjoy myself rather than having it be a part of me and completely take over everything I do.

&#x200B;

Last question I think, time scales. Does anyone have any idea (preferably from experience) what changes you felt in yourself after not smoking after say a month, 2 months, 6 months etc.?

&#x200B;

I hope everyone has a great New Year, I wish everyone here struggling and considering stopping or reducing their smoking all the best of luck. Until just before Christmas I genuinely thought I was fully addicted and I couldn't imagine not smoking going forward but honestly 3 weeks in I still can't think about the last time I had some and actually had a genuinely good time.

There's literally been ZERO negatives to quitting, and I always knew that from previous ""Quits"". To all of those struggling/contemplating going back - don't worry, it gets better.  You need to build new habits which, depending on how much/often you smoked, can take a while.  The longest I've ever went was \~120 days (started at age 15, now 27) without weed and during that period, I picked up new habits like reading before bed, stretching/yoga etc. that when I did eventually go back, I didn't like smoking the first couple times I did it.  I cannot stress this enough: you need to change your habits.

I‚Äôve just joined and I‚Äôm hoping this group will help and support me in my journey to sobriety.

I smoke everyday and all day which is costing me a lot, my head is all over the place and I feel really crap but trapped as I want to smoke and then don‚Äôt but struggle to stop! It‚Äôs like it has a hold over me. I‚Äôm down to my last few spliffs and decided not to buy anymore once it‚Äôs finished. Now that time is nearing I‚Äôm getting worried and anxious how will my day pass with no smoking and how will I fill up my time and not smoke or think about it. I‚Äôm worried how irritable and grumpy I will be with my loved ones as I get grumpy when I‚Äôve not smoked all day. I‚Äôve heard the first couple weeks are the hardest so I‚Äôm trying to prepare myself for them and mentally be strong to stand the withdrawals and irritability that‚Äôs due to come my way but in all honesty I‚Äôm really scared and last time I didn‚Äôt smoke for a period of time I was a emotional wreck and cried so much everyday. 

I have 3 kids and I don‚Äôt want to take my irritation out on them. Ideally I would take myself away for a week or 2 but that isn‚Äôt possible. My usband stopped smoking a few months ago when he fell sick with covid and hasn‚Äôt smoked weed since.

I (21m) have been smoking daily since I turned 19. Before that I would only really smoke 1-2 times a year with friends in order to keep appearances and look cool. It wasn't till I turned 18.5 that I applied for my first medical card, which turned to a slow decent of smoking once a month, then once a week, to daily by the time I was 19.

At first I thought I had it handled, until I got my heartbroken by the girl I loved who didn't feel the same way. I turned to weed because it made my depression feel shallow by numbing me to it. I thought that was what helped me get better but in reality this is when things went downhill.

My passion for learning stopped and I would only take Community college classes to make myself feel better by putting up this facade that I was okay. In reality I would only pass 1out of 5 classes every semester nose diving my Gpa to the point where I stopped seeing the importance of school and would only go to socialize with old HS friends and pretend like I was okay to my family. I stayed stagnant and content with my life because I was always to numb to realize that I never moved forward and hated what I became.

Fast forward to Sep. 2020. I dropped all my online classes and went too McDonalds with a friend telling her what happened. She told me to swallow my pride and go to therapy. Through therapy I came to the realization that every single problem and issue I had has gone unresolved to to my addiction with weed.

Long bouts of depression, constant anxiety, weight gain due to munchies, deep loneliness, and even bursts of intense negative emotions that would often lead to me asking God to just kill me so that I can leave this world without my family worrying. I just wanted to die. God writing this hurts.

I tried to stop smoking 2 weeks into therapy and lasted about 4-5 weeks before relapsing. It didn't help that 95% of my friends were stoners and it was through them I picked up the habit again and fully realized the control weed had on me. smoking with friend turned into weekly edibles which turned into me ordering weed in online delivery. All under the guise of me having control (which I never in the first place).

The final straw was when I was quarantined between during Christmas 2020 and I ended up spending $270 on 6 wax carts and a battery which I killed all before NYE. By the time I was done and sober enough to see the damage Ive done, I felt so weak and pathetic. But it was then I think I hit my rock bottom. I took a step back and tried to ask myself ""what have I accomplished this year?"" and realized that even with all the time COVID gave me I did nothing but waste it and regress into a person I was disappointed in. So on January 1st I stopped cold turkey and the withdrawals hit me like a train. The first night all I could think about was staying awake long enough till the dispensary opened but I held out! I made a list of goals that made me cry because it showed me the person I a, capable of becoming. This was my rock bottom and for the first time in years I started to look up.

Its now 1/8/21 and the cravings and compulsive feelings are gone thankfully. If it's temporary or not I plan on riding this sobriety wave for as long as I can. I'm thankful for the close friends I have that push me to be better, for the money and privilege of getting therapy, and for my family even though they don't know what i'm going through but still give me unconditional love and support.

For those of you trying to get sober and suffering from withdrawals I hope and pray that you have the same support I did, but I know its not always the case. Take a good look at where you are in life and ask the voice that shouts in your head if the weed it craves so much is worth the lose of time. Time that could be spent with family, friends, and self improvement. Ask yourself this everyday and know that the answer will always be ""no"". Then go to the mirror and apologize to yourself. The moment you realize that once you start love and learn to accept yourself is when that spark of change can truly start to show.

If you read this far thank you. Thank you for being in this sub because it takes a lot of courage to admit to this problem and start to look for a solution to it!",3,"{'quarantine': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6126879}"

(Sorry long post!)","Hi everyone, a little background first. This is day 12 for me. I was a long time user/abuser of weed. I have been smoking since 1998. This is one of many, many attempts to stop this horrible love/hate relationship I have with THC....

Last time i stopped was for a whole month last  September... Before that i had stopped for exactly one year. That was around 2 years ago. Everytime I relapse it's the same story, I convince myself I can smoke occasionally, but soon after it gets back to everyday, all day! I usually dab or use vape pens. Flowers end up not cutting it for me, and I vape ALL the time.

So off course, I get lethargic, I eat like crazy,  I'm always tired and don't feel like doing much, except get comfortably numb and watch TV. So in other words, it's really bad for my health.

Everytime I stop, I go through these withdrawals, cold sweats, diharrea, headaches, cramps, nauseous, insomnia.... And when I do get a couple of hours of sleep I wake up soaked in sweat. Everytime i tell myself this is the last time I am putting my body through this process.

After a while, close to the 2 weeks mark, I get very depressed, I cry for nothing, my emotions come back in waves and I feel like turning back to smoking to ease the pain. But this time I really want it to be the time I stop for good.

But beside the feeling depressed part, one of the reasons for smoking in the first place is so I don't dream. Or at least don't remember or notice I dream. When I get clean, dreams come back with a vengeance, I dream sooooo much and it feels so real that it bothers me throughout my day.

I keep getting flashbacks of my dreams and sometimes it gets confusing discerning the dreams from reality. I know it sounds crazy.. But it even affects me at work, scenarios from my dreams keep running through my head and I need to keep telling myself, it was just a dream.

Sometimes I wake up and I feel like I didn't really sleep cause I was consious in my dreams most part of the night and I don't feel rested. 

I got 12 days sober today and I really want to stay this way. Reading through my post now, I realize probably nothing can really be done about my vivid dreams, I guess it's something I need to learn to live with. Nonetheless I would still like to hear some of your thoughts on the subject.

I've always been an athletic and fit guy but smoking so much made me feel like I was wasting away. I ate garbage junk food and drank 5 cups of coffee a day. I felt weak and sickly. I was pale and had wicked black circles under my eyes all the time. I stopped working hard and excersizing. Now I can run again, I'm not exhausted after a day at work. I feel like my body fits again. I feel energy from food and don't need to be wired on caffeine. I have been cooking healthy meals and my stomach doesn't kill me. No more sweats and sleeping is getting easier. 

Now the challenge is all in my head. I'm paranoid and anxious. I had a confrontation with a coworker today (to be fair to myself, she violated my personal space and touched my hair without my permission) and didn't respond proportionally to the situation. I was made out to be in the wrong and pressured to apologize because I hurt her feelings. It stayed with me all day, grumbling in the background of my thoughts, distracting me. I felt paranoid that I was a crazy asshole with a short fuse. I found myself lapsing in good judgement all day and becoming internally confrontational, but I kept a calm and collected front. I was boiling inside however. It felt like everyone was trying to mess with me and it took all my energy not to react outwardly.

I'm proud I kept myself together but I can feel the stress is building and I can't let it go. Overall there was no real negative consequence to anything and I should just get over it and move on. I think I'm remembering some trauma from my youth that I've supressed. I started drinking at 14 and started smoking weed at 18. I had two situations with my parents adult female friends who touched me inappropriately while everyone was drunk and fucked up. I'm a man and they played ""pocket hockey"" with me before I was 18. I have tried to bring this up a few times but I'm always dismissed. Now that I've stopped smoking and started dreaming again I realize I've never processed it. I've never processed anything, I just buried it under pounds of weed. I'm hoping that I can take the weekend to try and work through the immediate insecurity over what happened today, but I know I'll have to go back to therapy to address the other stuff.

I have been smoking daily for 5 yrs now and in many forms it has caused harm to my life. Mainly I graduated in May for graphic design a two-year program that took me 6 years. (I am beyond embarrassed about this) I know that weed has a lot to do with it. I don't know how to briefly explain it, but I felt like I was no longer creative, inspired, or interested. I would spend hours and hours on the littlest thing that should have taken me 20 minutes. (not even an exaggeration.)

At this moment it's hard and I know it will be something I will have to face over and over again. Does anyone have any guidance on living with a weed smoker.

I got through the first month or so pretty well, initially the first week was fucking hell (couldn't sleep, nightmares, sweating, nausea, loss of appetite) but with the holistic tools I used I found myself feeling great after that (except other physical withdrawal symptoms like heart palpitations that lasted about a month n a half, still have super low libido and sporadic anxiety attacks), motivated and accomplishing a lot throughout my days. Now I'm 62 days in and about 3 weeks ago started to get depressed, hostile, lack of motivation, apathy, pretty much every symptom of PAWS but had no idea about PAWS until today after coming to this community and reading for like 2hrs through comments cus I was slightly considering buying some wax, I realized oh shit, I'm suffering from PAWS. Smh. It did bring me relief bc I thought I was just losing my shit and all the self development/transformation/healing  I had done the past 3 years was for nothing. So I'm relieved it's just PAWS but it's also shitty knowing that this can last for a couple years on and off especially considering my previous consumption....honestly just posting incase anyone else goes through this. Also bc I had seen another post saying quitting won't fix all your problems and this is so true. Not that I thought it would magically fix everything but now at 62 days I just feel worse, I feel even more lonely, depressed, loss of hope and just negative thoughts coming back. Thoughts I thought I had overcame in the previous years. I'm now realizing I had just suppressed a lot of my anger, abuse and trauma I had suffered, abandonment ... all that good stuff lol....and now it's coming up in my dreams which I never even dreamed before and if I did I wouldn't remember them. During the day I'll have memories come to me that I didn't even remember had happened!!!! Like wow, quitting has been a huge eye opener in how much I had numbed and forgot to survive. I've been on a healing journey these past 3yrs and now I'm realizing the healing has REALLY just begun since quitting smoking marijuana. Excited for the day I can say I overcame all of this.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.36212906}"

I was smoking dabs about every few hours. Quarantine made it tough because I‚Äôm not working and can‚Äôt do much because I‚Äôm helping my immune compromised mother. Probably a bad time to decide to quit but I‚Äôm passed the point of craving the dabs all the time but my anxiety is out of control I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I‚Äôve been working out and that helps but then eventually I get panicky and think something is wrong. Then I get worried and my vision gets funny or chest gets tight and I can‚Äôt get away from thinking I‚Äôm having some sort of health crisis which just makes the anxiety go even crazier. Was usually a busy person only smoking once or twice during the week and then get real baked on weekends but that turned into just getting real baked all day every day over the quarantine time. Tolerance was so high I was smoking 3 grams of high grade dispensary wax every week and a half. The withdrawals are pretty intense and I just want to feel normal again. So much stress and I‚Äôd love to just be able to relax. I‚Äôm still going strong on the quitting part but now I‚Äôd just love if the anxiety would calm down. When I get anxious I also start thinking I‚Äôm not eating or drinking enough and that makes me feel this weird weak feeling. I know I can do this and I can quit but I just wanted to post in here and see what people thought. I quit on December 26th and some days have stretches where they are good but at some point a panicked feel overtakes me and it‚Äôs just hard to get past.,3,"{'quarantine': 2, 'immun': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.69835454}"

I‚Äôm not a procrastinator but for some reason I keep convincing myself to push back my quit date.

More recently I‚Äôve realized that I have no idea who I am without it. I never was present enough in my own mind to figure it out. I quite honestly feel like it‚Äôs destroyed me as a person and become the strongest part of my identity. Hating this feeling is what is driving me to want to quit so bad.

So, today is my first day clean. It‚Äôs been a couple of hours and I‚Äôve been able to exercise self-control, but I know as the day goes on I‚Äôll just get more anxious. Particularly about having to fall asleep and stay asleep at night. And about having to work up an appetite to eat enough.

Here's a Pro Tip,"I have been a member for four years on Reddit r/stopdrinking and for maybe a year on Leaves. Pro Tip is go back and read all of your posts from the beginning.  It is a big help to see in black and white what I already went through.  The one good thing I can say about dumping both the wine and the pot is that each time I did so, I had longer stretches and it was easier to dump it again.  The thing that shines through reading the old posts is that nothing changes.  If I pick up, I will wish I didn't and I will be in a worse position than when I was sober.  It really does feel better all around being sober.  My latest realization in this process is what I need to change is my thinking.  I need to get out of my head.  I think what happened to me is that I feel a lot of regret, disappointment, anger, fear, loneliness, sadness because of the years of drinking wine (got up to a bottle a day consumed very slowly and sometimes two bottles stretched out over the whole day) and smoking pot every day is that I was avoiding life.  That makes me have those horrible feelings.  Not participating.  The other thing I discovered is that I am really reactive.  For years I have been trying to change my habit and learn to pause, stop, think, reflect and respond instead of react.  So, my Pro Tip is keep a diary and so you can see that nothing changes and if you pick up you will end up where you started all over again.  I'm not usually a slow learner.  I don't know why I wanted to keep experimenting.  After being sober off pot and wine for 8 months and pot for 5 I had both and got wasted and really regret blowing up a relationship.  It's just not worth it.  If you fall down seven times get up eight.  Sooner or later it is going to stick.  Have a great day people.  Oh, and it only took a week to start dreaming again.  I think the THC washed out of my body way faster cause I only smoked a few joints and had a few gummies whereas before the THC had been in my body 40 years.

It‚Äôs been really hard. The physical symptoms have been hitting me so hard, I‚Äôve barely been eating, upset stomach constantly. I‚Äôve basically lived off of tums and bread for the past few days. 

I know that I want this. I know that I need this. And day 3 was pretty easy. But today is proving to be hard. I woke up and all I wanted was to wake n bake. That‚Äôs been a staple in my life for at least 10 years. Every morning wake up, rip the bong a couple of times, get started on my day. Though, it got to a point where after that wake n bake, I didn‚Äôt get started on my day. I lay there staring at my phone completely out of it until I fell back asleep or had to go somewhere. 

I started a new job a few months ago and promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt smoke before going in, because my last job I was smoking during work all day and I was constantly paranoid about it. No matter how bad the anxiety I could not control myself enough to not smoke at that job.  But within a month of being at the new job, I was still taking hits all the up until 30 minute before I had to leave for work.

For the first year or so, I‚Äôd only smoke on the weekends, keep in mind 90% of the time through cartridges. Fast forward to the late end of freshman year in high school, towards summer, and I started buying my own cartridges. They went by in a month, then in 3 weeks, down to 2 weeks, down to 1 week... as a 15-16 year old. Now, with the exception of the occasional 1-2 week tolerance break (usually forced, most I‚Äôve gone since 14 years old is probably 2 months), I have been on the cart grind for close to 4 years. I‚Äôm 18 now (senior in high school) and can‚Äôt really imagine the neurological changes I‚Äôve forced my brain to experience. The worst part is that so many people that I know, ranging from freshman‚Äôs to seniors in school, face similar issues without realizing it. I‚Äôm only 2 days into my hopefully final (permanent) break from carts, and I definitely feel the anxiety that comes with it and the anxiety that I‚Äôve read a lot about. Addiction runs in my family (as it seems to now run in a lot of families), and my brothers face the same usage patterns (both older than me). It feels like a trap that I can‚Äôt escape, and when I have a moment of clarity that I am like ‚Äúwow, I‚Äôm never buying one again‚Äù, I purchase one a week later. 

I don‚Äôt think these carts have impacted my academics too much, or other major aspects of life, but I know the impact has been more negative than positive, and thats without even accounting for the long term health effects. Any advice for dealing with withdrawals in the coming days/weeks, what I can do to prevent relapsing with carts, and some possible reassurances that I‚Äôm fine? 

P.S. I live in a now-legal state (legalized the past few years), and yes, 95% of the carts I‚Äôve used have been black market. Early on, I know I‚Äôve been smoking boof, but the past year or two I‚Äôve made it a point to educate myself and trust the person I get them from (as much as I can). I feel like dab cartridges are their own drug, separate from weed... the high just feels much different and the psychological effects also seem to be much different.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6201695}"

I don‚Äôt normally smoke at all during daylight hours and only smoke about once or twice a month. I used to smoke much more often (a few times a week) but I‚Äôve managed to cut down my usage over time.  Although I don‚Äôt smoke very often anymore I can‚Äôt seem to go over a month or so without it. I‚Äôve quit more times than I can remember. Most times I go a little over a month and relapse, which is what happened this time. 

What makes this time so much more different is that this was the first time that I had the support of r/leaves and really made a commitment to staying sober. On day 44 I was living day by day being sober and happy. Then suddenly, on the morning of day 55 I decided to make things better with my dealer by paying him back the money I owed him. I wasn‚Äôt planning on buying any weed, just getting something off my back that I didn‚Äôt want to stress about anymore, but that changed fast. All of a sudden I didn‚Äôt seem to care about staying sober at all, and that same day I went and purchased a full gram cartridge from him and smoked it all night-last night.

I only got a few hours of sleep last night. The whole time I was high all I wanted was to be sober again. This morning I‚Äôm tired and foggy headed and am so ashamed of what I did.

Today I texted my dealer that I was quitting weed for the first time, and that no matter what I ask in the future, to refuse to sell me anything. I‚Äôm throwing away the cartridge that I bought, that barely has a bubble in it. I‚Äôm putting it somewhere where I will never be able to get it again.

I read Matthew Clarke‚Äôs book on quitting weed and I cannot recommend this book enough, wow what an eye opener! I never used to be depressed, anxious or socially awkward but after years of abuse I turned into this person. I promised myself I‚Äôd quit when I fell pregnant with my son, but I soon started straight after he was born to cope with the stress of a newborn. What I realise now is that it only made it worse. I was a neurotic and paranoid mother and I have deep shame and guilt that I may have ‚Äúruined‚Äù him emotionally in some way. 

Now, 5 years later, I have finally decided to let that shit go... again. I have quit weed and ciggies cold turkey and although it hasn‚Äôt been easy, I know these symptoms will pass and I‚Äôll feel so much better for it very soon. 

My parents have Insomnia and take sleeping tablets every night and I battle with it too, I‚Äôm wondering if this is hereditary? Does anyone have any tips on how to cope? I have been taking a sleeping tab every night to help me fall asleep and cope with the night sweats, I‚Äôm hoping to only do this for a week and then stop the pills. I guess I just need to convince myself that I can sleep by myself? But how? üßê it makes me anxious just thinking about it.

>*I am in favor of pot legalization and I believe than anyone who wants to smoke should be welcome to.*

>*But as a recovering addict with twelve years clean I also know that there are some people who want to stop and are finding it difficult.*

>*I'm hoping that /r/leaves can support discussions helpful to them. I'm not an evangelical non-user, so people looking to advocate that or oppose that will find themselves bored. I only want to provide a place for people who have made the decision that they want to quit, or are trying to sort through that decision for themselves.*

>*The name of the subreddit is, yes, a pun, but I hope a bit metaphor-y too: leaves being something that make the tree stronger, which I think a candid discussion will do, and ultimately something that can fall off once the time is right without hurting the tree itself.*

>*I've never moderated a subreddit before, so I'll do my best and I hope it's useful.*

By January 13th, 2011 [we had twelve posts](https://web.archive.org/web/20110113021419/http://reddit.com/r/leaves) and we were on our way.

When we started there was little, if any, acceptance that cannabis could pose dependency problems in anyone, and I absolutely credit each of you speaking openly about your experience as a big factor in the spreading awareness and understanding of addiction we have today.

**Where We Are**

Since then, we have grown somewhere between steadily and incredibly, culminating in November of 2020 when we had 302,000 unique visitors. We now average 1,300 posts and comments a day, each of them an individual moment of love and support that together define the beauty of our community.

In April, we started the Discord server and provide two live chat meetings every day, and that has grown to 3,100 members, a closely knit group for daily check-ins and mutual support. 

While our Reddit and Discord communities will continue to grow, I wanted to take today to share with you my thoughts and plans to expand the Leaves mission and reach more people who need our help.

**Where We‚Äôre Headed**

As a reminder, we aren‚Äôt about convincing people not to smoke, we are about helping people who have already decided for themselves.  

My goal for the next ten years is that we grow from a subreddit and Discord server into a thriving organization that can help as many people as need us.  I have three early goals:.

1. Create a governing organization to ensure things are not so dependent on me alone.
2. Increase the awareness and reach of our organization and mission outside of reddit.
3. Expand the services we can offer, including apps, web sites, books, education initiatives and, when they become practical again, in-person local meetings where we can meet fellow Leaves face-to-face.  

I think the idea of in-person meetings excites me most, but maybe that‚Äôs just because I‚Äôve been locked in my apartment for ten months.


To support these goals, I am forming a nonprofit organization to coordinate that mission moving forward.  I‚Äôm fortunate to have some resources to contribute to that effort myself, and I have others around me who will contribute as well, so we‚Äôll be off to a good start.  I‚Äôll also be dedicating myself to that effort full time.

We have had an amazing ten year adventure together, and I think our future will be even more exciting.  I can‚Äôt thank each one of you enough for everything you have contributed to that success, and in the next ten years I will work as hard as I can to honor and grow what we have already built together..

Love you all.

Yesterday, on Day 7, I was in the midst of a very tense and stressful work situation.  Zoom was crashing in the midst of a mediation, and I was essentially locked out of the call.  I started having a panic attack, my first in nearly a year.  My body when into overdrive: heart rate through the roof, body convulsing, restricted breathing.  I kept telling myself, ""I need my weed. I need my weed. I need my weed.""  But...it wasn't there.  I had scrubbed my house of it seven days before. 

Instead, I had to face that anxiety naturally.  I started breathing deeply through my nose.  I closed my eyes.  I pictured a fountain and started meditating on it.  Slowly, but surely, the panic passed.  As you can tell...I lived.  Lol.  

Today, I feel proud of myself for pushing through that fear by the power of my own brain and body.  I feel powerful.  I've given my brain some useful data: I don't need weed to escape anxiety spirals.  With more and more of this data over time, we are rewiring our neural pathways, away from weed and toward inner strength. 

BUT I'm all too aware that I would have smoked if it was still in my house.  I'm not delusional about that fact.

Although he wants to keep using, we have agreed on specific uses at home that won't interfere with my goals of quitting and we're both quitting combustion and cigarettes for good. So far I'm extremely proud of him (he is now using it on a strict, 3 x a day schedule instead of just whenever he feels like it... which was all the time...).

This was a major factor for me, as I had adopted the mindset of 'if he doesn't quit, I can't!', which was totally stupid and *addiction making excuses.* You have to do it for yourself. Although it is early days and I don't want to jump the gun, I have spent the last 5 years smoking as soon as I woke up and then throughout the entire day, right up until turning in for bed. Since Monday, I have only had like 2 or 3 hits at night right before going to sleep, and I actually don't miss anything about it?! How can it be this easy after so many years of torment and telling myself I had to do it, but couldn't, that it was impossible etc.?!

Although I'm still battling feelings of shame and low self-worth after many years spent in a total waster, wake-and-bake, self-sabotaging pattern,  I have now had 4 days in a row where I haven't smoked before 9pm. This may not seem like much at all, but I feel so resolved! I've thrown away all of my ashtrays, papers, stored lighters in a box in a cupboard, and I have my nicotine vape pen (finished the tobacco yesterday). I cannot wait to see where me and my partner are this time next year and I haven't felt so positive about our future in years.

I'm sorry this is so long and thank you all so much if you read it, and for contributing your own stories, I've been reading this board for years and I'm not sure I'd have ever even considered that MJ was ruining my life without your candid tales. I'm looking forward to updating every couple of months with our progress, and hope that the bf and I will be much further along in our goals of health and saving for a mortgage. Here's to a better 2021 for all of us üéÜüéâüòÅ

I‚Äôve been a daily smoker (night time) for around 10 years, and this has the longest I have abstained from using which I‚Äôm grateful for. 
One of the scary discoveries is that I have been someone else for those years, and my sobriety has brought me back to who i was when I was a kid. 
The past week has been actually quite amazing, especially when I lean into the idea of being who I used to be. But there are moment that arise, that remind me of how I would normally respond as my smoker-self, and I really miss it. 
Weed gave me the ability to watch, understand and appreciate films. The ability to read and visualise novels. It also allowed me to plan for the future, and it made me understand social interactions much more objectively. I‚Äôm not talking about being high and doing these things; the magic seemed to happen during the day (even though there would still be a small amount of THC in my system). I literally was unable to comprehend any of this phenomena before I started smoking at age around 18-19. 

At the moment I don‚Äôt know whether to accept that deep down, I am truly someone who doesn‚Äôt understand films, abstract concepts, people & society. Or whether the THC provided a buffer that allowed myself to comprehend these aspects of life. It seems like a possibility that these symptoms are reflective of depression, and I have tried to combat this with an SSRI and continual therapy, but these efforts proved futile. 

Despite these misgivings, I am proud and excited for not having smoked for 3 weeks. I suppose my mind notices who I used to be in certain situations, and tries to convince me to smoke again. I suppose I am unclear as to which version of life is most fruitful, ergh. Anybody else have this kind of experience?

I have set myself up with a long term aim which is an online counselling degree, I'm not 100% this is the course I will choose but my experiences on here have mad me feel it would be worthwhile.

So today is the day I stop counting the days, I feel counting the days is like looking at the weed and walking backwards, and when you're still focusing on the weed, you're focusing on weed still, and more likely to trip and fall walking backwards. 

When you focus on something it stays clear and present and the peripherals seems blurry. In this case the blurry peripheral is life. 

I believe that I have  now created enough distance between myself and it, I can now turn my back on it and aim at something ahead that is longterm, and forget what's behind me (i.e. the weed) 

My longterm goal has to help others and in turn, will give me a more fulfilling, rewarding life with a higher salary and more free time. 

Once you outrun the lion, forget it. If you hang around observing the lion in fear it still sneaks up on you and bites, you will never get over the horizon where you are truly safe. 

Observing the lion, keeping it in sight will keep you within a certain proximity to it always.

For me the lion is behind me, I escaped, so it's now no longer my focus, I'll put it into the blurry peripheral and now focus on life beyond the horizon.

I tried smoking in high school, didn't like it. Never touched it again in that period. However, in college, I was introduced to weed with a gravity bong. That's what really got me started. I went from smoking every so often with friends to buying my own pipe, bong, weed, etc. It was so fun at first. Smoke on the weekends or at night, or when I was doing chores/cleaning. Then, slowly, I started smoking more and more and more until it was an every day thing. Like, 3 or 4 bowls a day, for about a year. Every time I would start to light up, I'd feel incredibly guilty, but of course when I was high I didn't care anymore. About a couple months ago is when it stopped being even enjoyable (not fun even- it hadn't been for awhile before that either), and I finally have had enough. I'm about to write a thesis for graduation honors, and I need a clear head. I can't always be worried about if I have weed, when I can next smoke, etc. So, I threw all my paraphernalia away. Grinder, pipe, scrapers: gone. So now I have no choice to not smoke. I just feel so sick to my stomach. I can barely eat, and when I can I throw up. I don't want to keep living like this but I also don't want to keep using something that makes me feel so awful, so that's what's deterring my cravings.

I don't know how to explain it, it was just this feeling that came over me and I knew I'd smoke. I started out light and just smoked bud. It was fun again at first. Then of course it escalated. Within 4 weeks of smoking again I was back to burning a half gram cart in 2 days. Back to isolating myself with weed because going out would kill the high or I'd find it too hard to have conversations because I was high and spacey. 

I'm glad I fell off the wagon because it taught me that, yes, I am an addict. It feels a lil silly saying it about weed but seeing how my life immediately went back to revolving around weed and the next time I could be high.. I can't deny it. Idk what it's like for others but I just hate the raw sense of dread/urgency and anxiety that takes over my body and mind. I feel so tightly wound. I know it'll be over with by Monday probably but it just sucks. 

It feels like I'm probably just readjusting to having feelings again. Weed totally shuts me off. I'll miss it in a lot of ways because there is an undeniable change in my creativity when I use cannabis lightly but unfortunately I can't use it casually. Some people pick up a beer and can never have another. I pick up a blunt, bowl, dab - whatever form of weed - and I just want to get higher, I just want to smoke again. Then the anxiety comes on (at least for me) and I just become an anxious shut in that is almost constantly high. I stop making progress on my life. It's like I hit the pause button. 

I feel like the truth is that I don't have any coping mechanisms. I was 350 pounds almost 2 years ago and I'm 220 at the moment, so I know if I can manage my food addiction I can manage this one. I definitely noticed the less I used food as a crutch, I was progressively using weed more and more as a means of coping. I'm a very sensitive/emotional person and there was definitely a part of me trying to tone that down and numb it. If I want to quit forever I'll probably need to unpack some stuff in therapy and learn some healthy coping mechanisms. I want to be the best version of myself instead of wasting my life away.

And finally, I don't know why, but I had convinced myself that gaming was something I could only enjoy while high. Rationalising that it is something I enjoy, and something that put me in contact with a younger self, but not something I could enjoy if sober, as things would seam to get repetitive and boring.

But guess what? Its still fun!

For 14 days, I had a CHS (cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome) episode in which I had to be hospitalized 3 times for several days. 

It started a few days before Christmas - I woke up vomiting uncontrollably and it did not stop for the next 14 days. Every hour was absolute hell. Water, juice, applesauce, nothing stayed down. Aside from the vomiting, my entire body was shaking constantly and my abdominal pain was excruciating. The dehydration and vomiting exhausted my body to the point where I could not stand up on my own, and had a hard time sitting up to vomit. 

I had to be carried to the bathroom - not that I was going often. I went over 24 hours without urinating, and when I did, it was very difficult to do so (not to mention brown). 

My first and second hospital stays were exhausting and scary. My area is in lockdown due to COVID, so I was not permitted visitors and had to wear a mask between puking. The smell of my breath inside my mask made me puke more. The hospital is out of beds, so I spent the 5 nights total sitting up in a wheelchair. Alone. My back has not recovered from that. 

I was discharged 2x each time after several days and told they had no idea what was wrong with me. All they could do was give me an IV and try every anti-nausea medication under the sun - to no avail. 

My only relief during this ordeal was the couple hours of restless sleep I could manage after being sedated. No medication will help you with CHS. 

During my last stay I was told my liver had started to fail as a result of my sickness. It was only at this point it was suggested to me that I might have CHS, and the episode has to run its course. There is no treatment. All they could do was treat my liver and give me fluids to keep me alive. 

After another 3 days in the hospital I was discharged. The episode had stopped just as suddenly as it came on. 

However, I lost 13 pounds and as a recovering anorexic already underweight, this has greatly effected me. My hair, nails, and skin are still recovering. I am still suffering from acid reflux so strong I can hardly eat - not that my appetite has really come back. 

CHS can happen to anyone, at any time, no matter how long you‚Äôve been smoking. 
There were a few times during this ordeal I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would recover, and that alone was enough for me to throw everything away and quit cold turkey.

If I could tell you one thing, it‚Äôs this - withdrawals are a walk in the park compared to CHS. Withdrawals will not kill you, but CHS can. 

I believe in you. Don‚Äôt be like me - don‚Äôt send your liver into failure because you ‚Äòcan‚Äôt‚Äô quit.

Days went by and I forgot about my goals in life and I didn't do anything but get stoned and lay on the couch. A few days ago something just snapped, like a switched flipped inside of me. I realized I've been depressed for years. I've seen psychologist for years and got diagnosed with BPD as well as depression. And even though I knew about the diagnoses, I never felt like I was depressed. BPD is a real bitch but depressive? Nah... Not Me!! I've grown so much as a person since last year, and I'm starting to feel like I'm worth it again. I'm worthy of being happy and I actually want to be productive and take care of myself! I want to finish nursing school and since October I have a job in an elderly care-home. I realized I used to enjoy reading and writing in my diary before going to sleep. And I haven't been doing so all this time cause instead I smoked a joint, watched youtube videos and then K.O. straight to sleep. No dreams, waking up late every day with no energy. I don't want that anymore! And so, 2 days ago I decided to just quit. I never had trouble not-smoking weed when I was on vacation, so I knew I would be able to stop. I just never felt the need to stop. And now that I do, I feel so freaking powerful. I can do this! And the most scary part is, I told my dad. I told him everything. I told him how I've been smoking weed in secret every single day. I told him that's where all my money went. I told him why I did it and how it affected me. And most of all, I told him I'm ready to give it up for good. Cause if I wasn't ready to quit, I would never think of telling all this to the person I've been keeping it a secret from. I know it's just day 3, but I already feel like there's no way back. Something very powerful happened, I'm a new person. This is my new life. I don't want to numb myself and my feelings no more.
(wanted to share my thoughts and feelings so I can look back at this when times get hard, cause ofcourse they will. But right now, I'm feeling on top of the world!)

""Right now your judgement is clouded, its not right. You know deep down there is a better path yet you struggle so much to make the choice to go down that road. I know you are afraid. The fear is real but you can get through it. You've spent so much time bonded with this substance that you have become to rely on it and its altered your life in ways you can't even imagine. That will become more clear as you move down the new path. You want change and its not a trivial one. The challenge you have before you is monumental. Not only do you have to face your fears, make drastic changes to your life and work to undo the harm that has been done but you have to do it all without the device you've become dependant on to help you in times of struggle. Prepare yourself for a battle, one of the biggest battles of your life. Its going to take months but your forces are superior and you can succeed. Focus on getting through each moment, disassociate yourself from your old stoner lifestyle and do at least one thing each day to take a step forward. If you have a bad day, its okay, tomorrow might be better. If you have 2, 3 or more bad days in a row that is okay too. Better days will come if you just wait and take care of yourself.""  


There were so many strategies I had to apply to my daily living to help me get through this. Ultimately what lead me to where I am today was essentially a complete shift in the way I thought about myself and my association with weed. Before I use to believe that because of my using weed I had some hidden power, some advantage that others lacked. I had convinced myself of so many false justifications to continue using this drug that it took a bit to undo but I allowed myself to see, and believe, the truth. The truth of what weed was doing to me was right there in front of me but before I just refused to pay attention to that. The first few weeks, and indeed months presented me with a lot of challenges and opportunities to change my mind and go back to my old lifestyle. I never let that happen, I never let my mind even go down that road and I did that by reminding myself of my past attempts and failure (also learning experiences) and brought my thoughts back to my conviction to change. Change not only for those around me but mostly for myself, to free myself from the heavy burden of addiction I had carried around for a better part of my life. I only have one life, as far as I know, so with it half gone by my estimates I wanted to next half to be experienced without weed wielding its influence on my life.

This is my first post on here although I have visited countless stories and cannot express the appreciation I have for those of you who share your vulnerabilities in an attempt to comfort those going through similar circumstances.
Im 20 years old. My freshman year of college (2018) I got into a very bad habit of essentially constantly ripping ‚Äústreet‚Äù cartridges (maria carts, vape danks, eurekas, if youve heard of them you know what i mean). I used those extremely heavily for about 8 months and decided it was time to stop as I was not even receiving affects from using them. I quit them cold turkey and the effects were unexpectedly horrible. Tremors, ridiculous night sweats, panick attacks, constant depressession, brain fog, flooding emotions etc. I dont remember exactly but I believe after about a month or so I started to feel much better. Unfortunately, after actually being able to have a normal, healthy relationship with weed for a period of about 6 months (just toking with friends once in a blue moon) only to fall back into the 8+ bowls per day I built up to. Now im on day 4 of round 2, and I have to say (despite the waves of anxiety and depression, flooding emotions, and some difficulty getting a full nights sleep) the symptoms are DRAMATICALLY more manageable than previously. Im looking forward to getting through this initial phase, and hearing from the r/leaves community makes me feel alot better when I feel down. Thank you guys so much. Stay strong.

When I was 23 (currently turning 30 this year) Me and my gf at the time broke up who was super toxic but in my head I kept telling myself she's a model and it's worth it. Eventually she ended up breaking up with me which destroyed me, but looking back now I'm glad it happened.

 At this time I was a casual smoker. I smoked weed maybe once a week at this point. With all my free time I decided I was going to join a league of legends group at my college where I ended up meeting a friend there. He started coming over to my house to game with me and he smoked poppers (weed and cigs together). He asked me if I wanted to try one. As soon as I took a toke it was like everything was okay. That euphoria head rush feeling just took all my pain away. So for the following 4 years I was hooked. Every day before everything I did. I even wrote my final nursing exam stoned out of my mind... And I passed. (Im not a nurse anymore and the only time I didn't smoke was before a shift but those 12 hour shifts were killer to have to wait through). 

I decided I needed to take matters into my own hands so I went out to my parents house with my friends and my popper bong and my buddy brought out his bow and arrow and he was maybe about 30 ft away from it and nailed it on the first try. Ever since then I haven't smoked a popper. I did keep smoking cigs and weed seperate though. 

3 months ago I decided it was time to give up cigs. I had been trying for years and never succeeded. Right before my last day I had started taking these anxiety medications that my doctor prescribed me. Let me tell you they helped a lot with quitting smoking. It helped regulate my moods a bit and kept me sane. I've been free of nicotine since and I haven't looked back. 

I decided to quit smoking weed on Jan 4 (a Monday is always my starting day). I ended up failing my first night as I wasn't able to sleep until 3 am so I took a toke and passed out but I was so disappointed in myself. I took a melatonin and worked out to try and get sleepy but it didn't help. So Tuesday I tried again. This time I took my melatonin way earlier and drank some tea and I was able to sleep around 11 but woke up at 1, 2, 3, 4, and right before myalarm. I was so proud of myself but I was so tired. Everytime I went to the washroom at night I had to peel the sheets off me because I was so sweaty and when I went back in to bed it was freezing cold. Night 2 I was able to sleep around 10 but ended up waking up just as much again. I am proud to be on day 3 now. And I don't plan on going back.

Initially the rush of strange thought patterns and impulsivity comes back and then the sweating, which I‚Äôm assuming is the weed leaving my body...

After about 3-4 days sober the crazy dreams come back and they are extremely vivid almost like it‚Äôs real life. But I always wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat and my bed soaked with sweat. This lasted almost 4 weeks during that time before I caved and smoked a fat joint mostly out of boredom because of the lockdown.

Currently I‚Äôm smoking about 6-7 joints a day and are trying to go cold turkey again but are struggling with that addiction voice telling me it‚Äôs time to sesh.

If anyone has advice on how to focus the mind and reduce the impulsive thoughts id greatly appreciate it!

Hopefully everyone is safe and stays strong!

I‚Äôm currently living in a highly toxic environment. Weed has been the only thing keeping me from destroying things and beating people up. My dad is cheating on my mom with another woman and doesn‚Äôt make time for my sister and I anymore. When he was finally home on Tuesday, he walked right past me without even saying hello. I‚Äôm also female to male transgender and live in a very conservative county in rual Virginia. I was harassed and threatened out of school with no help from the administration. I‚Äôve been beaten, verbally harassed, and have received death threats. Every day that I step outside of my house and see the buildings where I was beaten and harassed in it triggers flashbacks to these events. I‚Äôm pretty certain that I have PTSD because of this. I‚Äôm sadly only 17 and have faced the dehumanizing feelings of discrimination. I used to have it so much better too. I used to live 90 minutes north of NYC in a town called Poughkeepsie. There the administration had my back at school. The student population bullied a transphobe out of the school for harassing me. My guidance counselor there is honestly my dad now. He still meets me with through Google Meet once week and talks to me. I got him a Christmas gift and mailed it to him but didn‚Äôt get my own dad anything. My guidance counselor was the one who made me realize how weed is ruining my life and my potential. I have an IQ of 187 and was named a musical prodigy. My guidance counselor has told me that I could do amazing things with my intelligence and music. He wants to see me follow my dream of becoming a child psychologist and reform the CPS system. If I keep smoking weed like I am, I‚Äôm never going to get there. I‚Äôve been known to smoke 36 grams in a week. I know I‚Äôm doing serious damage to my developing brain by smoking like this. I just can‚Äôt help it! I‚Äôm too full of rage and pain all the time to be able to stop myself. I‚Äôm currently unemployed and dealing with the Virginia Employment Commission which has been hell. I had to wait 5 months to even be approved. I filed on June 10th but didn‚Äôt receive my first payment until November 13th. I currently have $79.48 in my bank account. My plug delivers to me and lives 30 minutes away from me so he prefers that I buy at least a Q at a time. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to get through this. If I do cave into my cravings, I can‚Äôt buy until next Thursday when I‚Äôll get my $300 bonus from the VEC. I‚Äôll be getting a total of $1,058 next Thursday since they owe me so far two weeks of $300 bonuses in back pay. I might be able to convince my mom to loan me some money to buy weed and I pay her back plus interest next Thursday. I‚Äôm good at always paying people back because the guilt drives me insane. I feel like by quitting now I‚Äôm putting myself in a more dangerous situation than I‚Äôm already in. One the reasons why I had started smoking in the first place was to replace cutting. I already caved into those cravings Sunday night and cut myself after 4 months of being cut free. I might reach out to my guidance counselor and see if he can speak with me tomorrow about this. That would probably be the best idea. If you all have any advice to offer me whatsoever that would be wonderful.

This week started as a dry January thing. In my mind, dry January had an end-date, which my previous attempts did not include. Somehow, this made it easier. And yet, here I am, not even a full week in, I'm already having hesitations about going back to my old ways despite these GOD AWFUL headaches.

**I've tried quitting before and could never make it past Day 1. I was always hurtful to myself, proclaimed myself a failure or excused myself as a functioning addict. And despite the fact that my internal language needs work, each of those attempts brought me closer to this, where I am now.**

I think there was (and still is) a deep part of me that was scared to ""move on"" from it. Because moving on meant I would need to face all of the shit I have been running away from in my mind. And in hindsight, maybe I needed that time to run away and comfort myself. I'm not ashamed of the many empty cartridges I've tossed or the daily piles of ash I've created. I couldn't see the process, the movement towards something better growing inside of me.

I never had the same problems alot of the people here have, good job, nice gf, plenty of friends. Though I'm not sure if that's down to me just being more functional.

I don't think I'm addicted, I've stopped without any real issues, insomnia is a bit of an issue but that's been a problem for most of my life (when I don't smoke anyway). First night was a little tough because I was bored and had ran out of smoke.

Started smoking for fun, stopped smoking when the police got involved in a sesh, started smoking again for medical reasons... Though that purpose quickly went out the window. If only the UK was legal I'd buy the low thc cheap'o skunk. But alas.

Why am I posting this? Dunno, maybe as something to read later. I'm going round to a friends house for a quick smoke, plan to buy a 3.5, instead of the usual 2oz. If the 3.5 turns back into regular use then I know I'm a fucking addict, and reading this will be a nice reality check.

What's it like not smoking? 

Well, despite getting maybe 3/4 hours sleep on average, I don't feel any more or less tired than normal. 

My cognitive ability is, sadly, noticeably better. My vocabulary a little more diverse, I also handle myself better in conversations. The average chat just seems... A little more pleasant.

Why did I stop? Whelp, its a lot of money to see go up in smoke, and a dealer I buy from did my friend out of a few hundred, the whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth, so when my stash ran dry I didn't hit him up. Also for science, curious to see if I would have any withdrawal symptoms and if I have the mental fortitude for it.

Why am I starting? The excuses I'm using is that I wonna go check in with a couple friends of mine (whom will sell me the 3.5), also wonna pick up some for a family friend who uses it instead of her extremely harmful sleep meds... I say excuses, because I could easily do these things without getting stoned.

Anyway, thought I'd write my thoughts out, partly for me and who knows, maybe some ents will see it and follow me and the many others here who decided to kick this habit.

So that's that... I'm gonna go walk 30mins each way in near freezing temperatures while breaking quarantine, so I can watch my hard earned money go up in smoke.",3,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4645016}"

Weed over the past 5 years has caused me to become psychotic due to my bipolar, it has taken literal months out of my life living in a hospital where I had no grasp on reality, I was there 3 times because I couldn‚Äôt drop the spliff. 

It‚Äôs taken so much out of me financially that I‚Äôve had to use pay day loans to buy weed, I‚Äôve had to go into debt with credit cards because I just could not think of an existence without cannabis.

I can happily say now that I feel free from cannabis, I never want to go back to feeling like that again, my mind is healthy and I‚Äôve been healthy for 2 years now, I can handle my bipolar fine now and I don‚Äôt have to worry as much about relapses.  I‚Äôve managed to save a lot of money and buy my self nice things and save some money on top of that.

And this week I‚Äôve been doing a hit or two every other day.  The weird part is yesterday after I took a hit, it almost felt like my ears switched, my clogged one felt like it opened up, and my other ear felt muffled.

It was not good for you anymore and you know this in your heart. Going back is a waste of time and energy (and you might miss better opportunities by not letting go of a toxic past). And only when are are ''over'' that person that we realize how much better, happier, in peace we are by letting them go.

This feels so different from other times and I know it's going to stick.,"I've smoked for 10 years and tried to quit many times but on December 8, 2020 something just... changed. I felt strong enough to really quit for the first time and while I still have occasional cravings I can now just breathe past them and not cave. I just wanted to share my personal story as a means of catharsis, processing, and hopefully helping others on this subreddit. What worked for me may not work for you since we're different people but if it can help even a little, I'd be delighted.

These are the things that came together and worked for me this time around: 

1. **Changing careers from something I despised to something I enjoy.** I know this is much easier said than done but for me, finding a career path I wanted to pursue was the beginning of true healing. My smoking really escalated about 6 years ago when I started working in a super demanding but stagnant field that made me hate life so much. Making a career change was a huge risk but it paid off big time and I'm so grateful for being able to work in something that now aligns with my values and interests. 
2. **Started seeing a therapist.** My first therapist was wonderful in helping me realize I had problems with anxiety and low self-esteem. I started seeing her because I became so terrified of failing in a career change that I couldn't even bring myself to research schools/ certifications/ programs to help point me in the right direction. She wasn't able to help me kick my weed addiction-- in part because I was the first weed addict she had ever seen-- but I will forever be grateful for how she helped me uncover numerous underlying issues I had been suppressing. When I quit my job I stopped seeing her but this was also a net positive because it led me to eventually switching to a therapist who specializes in addictions. 
3. **Meditating.** I had tried meditation a handful of times in the past but it never really stuck. In April, Headspace was giving away subscriptions to anyone who was unemployed and I decided to go for it. Still didn't meditate (lol) but then I went through some dark shit in October and decided to start in earnest. This time, it worked like a charm*.* I still can't believe how much more peaceful I feel. I can actually feel my body and emotions now which sounds silly but it took practice for me. I started slowly (1-3 time a week) and now do an 11 minute meditation every morning. \*Side note for meditating: I do it lying in bed even though it's not ideal and sometimes it's so relaxing I fall asleep afterwards. IDGAF. Any meditation is good meditation and I'm happy with my practice. Can't be bothered to sit upright and I'm still reaping some great benefits! Who says you need to be some sort of perfectly disciplined zen monk to participate? 
4. **Switched therapists.** I took a break from therapy for about 9 months while I was transitioning jobs and dealing with life and my new therapist is wonderful. He's worked with a lot of addicts in the past which is exactly what I needed. Here are the biggest things that worked for me: 
   1. Tracking how I felt before, during, and after smoking. I only did this 1-2 days a week to not overwhelm myself but it was really eye opening. Realized that I was smoking 2-8 times a day and couldn't differentiate between the ""Before"" and ""After"" phase after smoke session #2 because everything blurred together after that. I also realized I smoke when I needed motivation but that this backfired when I got so tired I couldn't even follow through on the thing I originally wanted to accomplish. 
   2. Wrote a list of everything I like about myself. Cheesy, but it actually worked. I would read the list of things that make me awesome at least once a day so that I could memorize some qualities and incorporate them into some positive self-talk mantras. They sound a little like this: ""I'm good enough, I like myself, I'm funny, and I am a fucking badass for pursuing what I want in life. I know I've failed before but it doesn't define me and I've succeeded in so many other domains""
   3. We set a reasonable goal (for me) of trying to smoke only 3 times a day. This gave me back some control over the habit for the first time in a very long time. I had tried variations of this before but always failed. What changed this time was going back to my mantras. Going back to that list of accomplishments and things I loved. Reminding myself that I am worthy and capable. Also, for this period of time, the limit allowed me to sit back and enjoy my highs a little more. I know that might be weird advice and a little counterintuitive but savoring my smoking sessions actually made it easier to cut down and trained my brain to get more enjoyment and gratitude out of everything including weed. 
   4. Mind-mapping why I thought a ""zero day"" was scary. After successfully cutting down to 3 a day for a few weeks, my therapist asked, ""Do you think you can go down to zero for a day?"" and I FREAKED OUT. Sensing the discomfort, he asked me to write about it and try to get to the core of why I was so scared of zero. The biggest thing that stood out to me was seeing myself writing the words, ""I don't believe in myself. I don't think I can do it."" Something about that statement just broke me and I just didn't want to be this person who couldn't trust themselves. I refused. It lit a fire in me I didn't know I had. I cycled through sadness, anger, rage, indignation, and then finally landed on compassion and determination. I decided that I want to trust, love, and believe in myself. If I don't, who will? Also, there's no reason why I shouldn't be able to because I'm pretty awesome.

After getting to the core of why a ""zero"" day was so scary for me, I just... stopped. I didn't even have expectations or plans to stop and in some ways it was incredibly anti-climactic. Everything I was doing to improve my life just came together in that moment and gave me the strength to walk away with very little fuss or drama.

I even smoked two more times since that zero day because my original plan was to be a weekend smoker (again, I really didn't expect myself to fully quit. Plus my housemates smoke) but it was like a switch had flipped in my brain. 

When I smoked, I didn't like the feeling anymore and I think a big part of this came from my meditation practice!! I could feel its negative effects so acutely. I felt panicky, I felt my heart racing really fast and the blood vessels in my head constricting. I felt awkward and I could feel how slow and disordered my thoughts were getting. Then I got so hungry I ate everything in sight and then fell asleep without brushing my teeth and woke up groggy/ gross with a stomachache. 

In some ways, I'm glad I did try smoking those two times because it made me realize that maybe, on some level, I was addicted to feeling *bad*. Feeling terrible was comfortable to me because I was used to it. I was so out of tune with my body, emotions, and needs that I had no idea what feeling good meant. 

Now, I do know how to embrace just feeling good and feeling content. I know how to be more present and pay attention to my mind and soul. I know how to get pleasure out of things that aren't weed because the dopamine factories in my brain are back in business. I like this analogy because when you're hooked on a substance, it really is like your brain outsources the seratonin/ dopamine production to weed or whatever else you're hooked on and shuts down its own factories. It's different for people with Depression or other mental illnesses who genuinely may need medication to change their brain chemistry but for me in particular, this was an accurate depiction of what was happening. 

Plus, a lot of things in my life genuinely did improve which made quitting much easier. I'm not gonna lie and say it was all willpower, some of it was environmental.

Part of me is still scared of relapse but there's this deep calmness and confidence this time around with the knowledge that I am a different person with better tools, understandings, and priorities that will keep me sober. I'm not the same person who failed to quit so many times before (btw, I am so proud of that person. They tried SO hard and went through a lot. Couldn't have gotten this far without them). I've genuinely changed and I know you can too :) 

&#x200B;

Other random tips and insights that helped me: 

* It takes people 5-10 tries on average to successfully quit a substance or walk away from an abusive relationship. I'm probably at least on try #7 or 8 so it was about time for me to succeed. 
* Try things over and over again. You are not the same person you were a month, a year, a decade ago. This time, a tool or strategy that didn't work before might stick so don't let past failures rule things out completely! 
* If I'm being honest with myself, most of my past attempts at quitting were more for romantic partners and came from a place of shame and guilt. This is the first time in my life that I've genuinely liked myself enough to really do it for ME and it's made a world of a difference. 
* When I do get a strong craving, I focus on my breath and watch my thoughts from a distance. I repeat my positive mantras, remind myself that I'm strong and that I am enjoying myself and don't need anything more than this one moment. So far, it's worked!
* Things take time so be patient and be kind to yourself. I don't know you but I love you and I know you can do this.",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7808671}"

The first time I went into withdrawal.. it was one of the worst things I had ever experienced in my life. I documented it on here but it was a long process of sweaty sleepless nights, drinking smoothies and eating saltines, and trying to find joy in daily things that weed used to make more interesting for me. To put it into perspective.. I lost about 20lbs withdrawing from it and not in a healthy way at all. I quit and I went on with life and tried to find other hobbies. I brushed up on my cooking skills, got into decorating my house more and even renovated our backyard. Once all of my withdrawal symptoms actually subsided I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you guys how great I started to feel. My eyes opened to so many things.

November hit. I turned 26. Lost my health insurance during a pandemic. The state of the country I live in is enough to keep me anxious most days. I smoked for the first time in months and I felt calm. For the first time in a little while.. I felt calm. A feeling this world hasn‚Äôt given us recently... and I clung on to that feeling like nothing else mattered because I convinced myself I needed it. 

So here we are in January.. I definitely am not smoking as much as I used to... but it‚Äôs still and everyday thing again. I‚Äôm on day 2 of quitting once again.. and let me tell you. I spent last night sweating and not sleeping. I spent today trying to get some kind of food to go down but I‚Äôm about to switch once again to water and saltines just to help with the nausea. 

It‚Äôs not any easier the second time around you guys. I love weed.. I love how it makes me feel while using it.. but I don‚Äôt like how it makes me feel when it‚Äôs time to stop and that is a problem.

I want more money for us to do nice things. I want more motivation and to just be the best mother I can and I just feel now that weed gets in the way of that! I always believed it helped me for so long but I no longer feel that way! Yet the feeling is still there in the back of my mind that I'm not strong enough to follow it through!

2021-01-06 13:00:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/krt833/i_really_need_advicehelp/,I Really Need Advice/Help,"Hey everyone, I just discovered this sub and have been reading so many inspirational posts. This is actually my very first post on reddit! However, this is definitely not my first time trying to quit smoking marijuana. Here's a bit of background to my journey with this plant so far:

I started smoking weed at 18 at the end of senior year of high school. My school did ""random"" drug tests which probably preventing me from trying cannabis earlier, but also may have been part of the reason I latched on so hard to it. When I first started, I was told by my best friend at the time that it was actually non-addictive, and I foolishly believed him along with some of the bullshit websites/reddit posts online claiming marijuana is all good and no bad. Slowly, I began to become psychologically dependent on this substance without even realizing what I was doing to myself. 

Smoking with my friend once a month became once a week, quickly became once a night, and then before I knew it, I had my own stuff and was getting high a lot more often. Before I tried marijuana I was in the best shape of my life both physically and mentally: I was working out daily and gaining muscle (I'm a skinny dude), and my confidence was at an all time high. Since hindsight is 20/20, I can safely say that marijuana has destroyed both my motivation and in turn my self-love over the past two years.

The first sign that things were going wrong was me giving up going to the gym, and things going downhill with my relationship. I noticed these things but never blamed weed because I loved the feeling it gave me so much. Once school ended, I was smoking every day all day, even at work, however I still had the ability to feel like my old self when I was sober. Things began to unravel much faster once I got to college.

Before my first semester of college started, I promised myself I would quit. At the time, I still was present enough to realize that my working memory was not nearly as good while I was smoking. As many of you can probably guess, I never quit and the addiction became much stronger. I struggled to get used to the large amount of homework and responsibility that I needed to succeed in college (I also have ADHD which does not help the matter either). As my grades dropped like a rock, my marijuana use climbed rapidly. Any time I was feeling like a waste of life it was so easy to just spark up a joint and forget. Before I knew it, first semester was over and I failed all my classes but one. Second semester was not any better, I failed all of those classes as well. I wasted my parents money, my money, and a whole year of my life.

Fast forward to the next year, I was still smoking just as often and for the same reasons. I decided to take this fall off because of COVID-19 and lived at home with my family. My mental health improved over this semester (sort of) because I became very aware of how much marijuana was impacting my life. I also picked up guitar this year and music is one of my biggest passions. However, I only felt like playing when I was high (I know my habit is holding me back a lot with guitar too). Eventually though, the highs starting becoming shorter, and I was spending more money than ever before, so I took a break when I went on vacation with my family over thanksgiving. It was very difficult to bear at first: The excessive boredom, aches in my body, lack of appetite and sleep etc. But by the time I was driving home after these 1-2 weeks sober, I already felt more energetic, content, and frankly, less dumb. For a brief moment, I felt what it was like to be myself again after almost completely forgetting.

However, if things were okay after that, I would not be asking for help right now. My addiction is back in full force these days. My brother, who is a year and a half younger than me is also addicted, doesn't have his driver's license, and is always asking me to get weed for him. If I don't want to get more, he always pushes me to get more and I cave in. I feel so bad for him because we can't go anywhere due to the virus and I realize how much it sucks to quit, and I don't want to cause my brother the same pain, which is why I always give in. I know it sounds weak, but it is hard enough for me to quit alone. It's more than twice as hard to quit for two people, especially when the other guy doesn't want to and is literally begging you to get more pot. Besides, even if I did stop buying weed, my brother would find another way to get it through deliveries and what not, meaning I would have it around me no matter what and if it's around, I will use it because I am an addict. 

I have never felt so hopeless, and I broke down today just reading posts on this sub. If anyone has advice, I really need some while I'm stuck at home for this next semester. I have nobody I can talk to that can actually relate to this. Help would be appreciated so much!

TL;DR: I have been addicted to weed for almost two years and it has sapped my motivation, brain power, and happiness. My brother is part of the reason I can't quit and I will be living with my family for the foreseeable future. What do I do??",3,"{'covid': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44323117}"

Last year from March to May I smoked daily, I was high everyday, all day, I used lockdowns as an excuse but looking back now the addiction is embarrassingly clear.

Once the weed supply in my country went dry due to corona I was forced to quit and over the next few months I was able to feel my emotions properly, not a numbed imitation of emotion, I was able to lift myself out of bed and do something other than smoke, embarrassingly before I smoked before eating, or really doing anything because I'd convinced myself it would be better.

Looking back then it was obvious I was using weed as an escape from dealing with personal issues in my life, being high let me forget about my issues and let me avoid dealing with major incidents in my life, unknowingly using it to deal with personal issues just made me fall deeper into the depression I was trying to escape from, stupidly when I returned to university last year I fell back into the habit of daily smoking immediately.

Another aspect of smoking daily is the self isolation, socially I have never been the best but I get by, when smoking however all I want to do is be alone, even isolating myself from my family.

Its not even like I was enjoying smoking anymore, it seemed to have become a necessity for my day, I never even really felt the effects of the weed that I used to enjoy about it, infact I started to feel the effects of what I think was mild psychosis, strange thoughts that previously I would just dismiss as ridiculous started to seem possible to me. I thought that everyone I knew was out to get me, sitting in my room hearing things outside, my brain somehow translated these noises into people talking about me and what a failure I was, and about what a horrible person I am, still I smoked. The scary thing is I knew that these noises, or random people passing by were of no significance to me, but even though I was aware of this, part of me thought it was somewhat possible.

Since quitting I've realised how important proper sleep is, I never realised how much I missed dreaming, it has made me realise just how valuable the lessons that dreams teach us can be. 

I don't necessarily think weed is a bad drug, infact initially I think it widened my perspective on life and made me more social, I think the bigger problem was my lack of self regulation. I still think it should be legalised or at the very least decriminalised, but I have finally realised personally I can't smoke it casually. 

Looking forward I am hopeful of becoming someone that I want to be rather than sitting on my ass expecting self-improvement and enlightenment to come from rolling a 2 skinner, I'm getting into running and hope this year is finally the year I can become myself again.

A tale of abused MEDICINE.","I grew up in a dysfunctional hellhole, and at the age of 16 I started to smoke marijuana. It started when someone passed me a pipe at a party, and I thought, ""Nobody is going to know...why not try it and see what happens? Can't knock it till you try it right....""


Soon enough, I was selling to my friends and had an endless supply of weed. I found solace in this plant medicine. With my friends, I felt like I had some confidence in my personality and we all had a blast TOGETHER, and keep in mind that is a significant factor.


Marijuana, as a medicine, showed me that an alternate and more peaceful reality was possible outside of my current bubble of traumatic effects. Thank the heavens for this. **Cannabis is a beautiful thing, and as Terence McKenna might say, a messenger sent from our mother earth.** The message? **""There is much more beyond the current moment, what do you want to see? üòà""**


I studied IT and computer science from the age of 12 on my own, I was just a nerd that loved video games. That interest lead me to build my own computer to play games in higher fidelity, study programming to hack them, and then IT certifications as I realized my socioeconomic outlook given my fucked up and impoverished household.


I recall my only dream as a 17 year old being, ""just having my own place, marijuana concentrates, and a girl to enjoy life with."" Little did I know, that would be the death sentence of my highest aspirations.


By the age of 17 I was working a shitty job, but had enough money to start what would be an 8 year daily binge habit. I did have tolerance breaks, but due to other substances like caffeine and sugar I relapsed regardless of the impending self-loathing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

At 23, I realized that I was most definitely ADHD and had not grown out of it. I started medicating my ADHD with Aderall, and then a few months later I started taking an SSRI for my serotonin hypersensitivity, which I believe to be a result of my childhood(My first memory was getting slapped in the face HARD in a high chair by my psychotic mother, which set the tone for my whole adolescent experience). At this point, I was addicted to weed, caffeine, and sugar.

**Nobody taught me that caffeine and sugar were addictive psychoactive substances themselves.**

It took me the last two years on Aderall to realize how destructive my weed, caffeine, and sugar habits were. I often think back to how my conscious experience felt as a teenager, and it's been difficult to decipher what was substance induced behavior and what was the neurobiological experience my genetic code dictated. I started self medicating my ADHD with caffeine when I was merely 13 years old or so. I was drinking 1-2 liters of Dr.Pepper a day because Dollar General made it so affordable for my parents($1.00 2 liters?) I guess...I had absolutely no idea who I truly was.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Now, I'm 25 years old. I've been getting just a tad better at controlling my habits every month. I was able to keep smoking to the weekends, zero caffeine in a year other than ""treat"" days, and consistently less sugar. I relapse hard because of my lack of impulse control, for the July 4th weekend I consumed \~2,000g of sugar with my partner. One step leads to the next, to the next, and now I'm deep in the red with no way out until the wall of self-hatred and disgust hits and I'm left feeling like a recovering drug addict on Monday returning to work.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

**The Whole Point of This Story - Regaining Paradise**

The end to this stricken chapter of my life.

I read Terence McKenna's, ""*The Food of The Gods.*"" I now realize that my yearning for the reprieve of substance use is intertwined in all of human history. You and I are not unique. Terence details the history of Tobacco, Tea, Coffee, Psilocybin, indoles, tryptamines, and how dominator cultural values destroyed our connection with nature. It is the most impactful text I have found to understand my use of drugs.



I relapsed on weed for the Christmas and New Year breaks. For Christmas, I ended up in a 4 day identity-free checkout as the result of herb from Colorado. While I should've known the whole time, this particular dealer informed me nonchalantly that it was medicinal product.



That weed is like opiates. If I had some terminal illness, that's the weed I'd be smoking. You wake up from the binge feeling like you slept in a time machine, with little to no recollection of where your impulses lead you for that period of time. Not to make this sound enjoyable, when I return to my ego on Monday self loath and am in total disgust with my decision to buy again.



For New Years, I had some Trufflez Pirates from California, which is the polar opposite of effect from the medicinal Colorado herb. This herb had me so overstimulated I couldn't even sleep. The pressure in my head was absolutely unbearable. I could feel the neurological depletion occurring, and it only took two smoke seshs with this herb to realize I never wanted to smoke marijuana ever again. You know that moment where ""comfort"" has left your body as a feeling you are capable of experiencing? How your silk sheets, Calvin Klein bedding, expensive bullshit feels just the same as a cold concrete block?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

**The Solution**

Before these recent epiphanies, I thought I only needed better impulse control to stop my binge habits. This was only effective in some cases, when impulses were the problem. The Christmas/New Year weed purchases weren't an impulse. I thought, philosophically, it was OKAY, because I was ""Rewarding myself."" So if you only use impulse regulation as a strategy to not smoke, you aren't safe. Because when a friend passes you the bowl, ""it's just this once, I don't do it all the time, it's just sharing time with my friend"" or whatever REASON you find to smoke.



For me, the solution is two-fold: Impulse regulation, and a deep philosophical reason to never ingest substances at random.


The philosophical reasoning being that the effects of weed range from that similar of opiates, all the way to methamphetamine. When prepared and ingested orally, the marijuana can be 5-10x(?) more psychoactive, so furthermore we have no clue what the fuck we're doing to ourselves.


Marijuana is to be RESPECTED. While it can help us through traumatic stress, Mary will GLADLY punch you in the FUCKING SOUL for abusing it.


If Marijuana is to be in my life, it will be in a FUCKING MEASURED DOSE of all of the cannabinoids and terpenes. Not ""a few bowls of that,"" and, your homie's matched random ass weed.


WEED IS NOT EVIL. WEED IS MEDICINE, A DRUG, TO BE RESPECTED. DO NOT FUCK WITH MARY, OR SHE WILL FUCK YOU.


**TL;DR**


I was addicted to marijuana, caffeine, and sugar. All dopaminergic actors to some degree. Aderall helped me see the cause for my addictions, and I slowly phased out these substances, although with disgusting relapse.

I found that the solution to my problems is two-fold: Impulse regulation, and a deep philosophical reason to never ingest substances at random. The reason being: MARIJUANA IS A FUCKING DRUG MEDICINE. IT'S NOT, ""JUST A PLANT."" PLANTS CONTAIN FUCKING DRUGS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL SUBSTANCE KNOWN TO MAN. Marijuana ranges in effects similar to opiates, all the way to methamphetamine. Why the fuck are we ingesting substances which have not been studied, essentially performing research on ourselves at random with whatever the fuck a dispensary or street dealer sells us on a given day.


WOULD I LET A PHARMACIST JUGGLE TWENTY BOTTLES AND GIVE ME A FUCKING RANDOM ONE FOR MY ANXIETY AND ADHD?


THEN WHY THE FUCK AM I INGESTING RANDOM STRAINS OF MARIJUANA WITH ABSOLUTELY NO RESEARCH AS TO THE SPECIFIC CANNABINOID AND TERPENE CONTENT OF THAT WEED AND THEIR EFFECTS?

Every time I regretted it afterwards, and every time I felt this immense sense of guilt and failure, like I wasn't good enough. Also, 90% of the time I smoked, it was incredibly anxiety inducing and unpleasant so 0/10 recommend.

Since then though, I've started changing the way I look at my quit date. Instead of using my quit date as a marker for when I last smoked, I now look at it as a marker for when I got rid of my unhealthy habits that I'd been carrying around for so long.

Since 2 months and 9 days ago: I haven't smoked alone, I haven't smoked every night, I haven't owned any weed, I haven't been planning for my next reup, etc. In short, 2 months and 9 days ago, I freed myself from my addictive tendencies.

This is not our first time quitting pot but it is the first time my husband and I have done it at the same time. We both agree we are second-rate versions of ourselves when we smoke and we have big goals this year (plus two children and professional careers). We have spoken about quitting for years. 

I‚Äôm scared that my husband doesn‚Äôt have a personality and that weed was making him friendly and nice. He is a completely different person (was the same last time he quit for 6 weeks). He gets so serious and is so boring. Also super passive aggressive and overreacts to things then chooses to drag out his anger in a passive aggressive way (we are on day 4 of that).

How much time do I expect it will take to normalise/find a personality equilibrium? I don‚Äôt want to believe he would be like this forever because I couldn‚Äôt stay married to that. It‚Äôs not the person I married. 

When he would smoke he would often calm down and be able to see where some things were his own fault and not just mine. 
He‚Äôs been really cranky at the kids and today when my friend came over he didn‚Äôt smile and made her feel really uncomfortable. 

Can you tell me, for some of you who have had longer off the weed, if your personality went through shifts and changes before finding a new normal?

Rough but fairly accurate estimates - I was smoking about 18 - 20 grams Monday to Friday, 5 or 6 joints a night from 5:30pm to 12:00am after work. Then at weekends it would generally be an all day long affair if I had nothing to do or the 5 or 6 joints I was smoking during the week. Band practice would be a chain smoking marathon which could be 2 or 3 times a week, on nights out we'd be rolling them under the table in pubs and chaining them once more. When going to gigs with the band, the number increased based on distanced travelled in the van, then one before sound check, a few after sound check and between the show, one before the show, a few on the way home and finally one for myself when I got home before I went to bed. So if I had to take a not so wild guess, I was probably smoking in the realms of 100 grams a month - something had to change. 

Overall I'm doing okay thus far: the cravings come and go, I wake up 2/3 times a night but overall the sleep I have been getting hasn't been awful so to speak, night sweats have been bad but I'm managing and I'm actually enjoying the mental dreams to be honest. but the one thing that is absolutely horrible that I want to know if anyone else experienced and how long it might last for is in the title. The headaches I've been waking up with are the stuff of nightmares, it feels like King Kong is squeezing my head between his fingertips. I don't get any more during the day, it's only when I wake up and I cannot wait for it to stop. Anyone else out there go through something similar? Any coping tips or is it just a ""no choice but to just ride it out"" situation?

Not my first rodeo,"Started casually smoking at age 16 in 2009 then that turned into everyday when I was 18 in 2011. Ive always been a skinny dude who could never eat a whole lot so I would use weed as an excuse to eat more so I can put on some extra weight. I also live in Oregon and everyone around me smokes so I had no idea how much of an issue it was for me personally. 

In 2017 I had a great job opportunity but of course I had to pass a drug test. I really needed this job so I was willing to do anything to get it so I stopped smoking 6 weeks prior to the test - and boy was that tough. 

Even though I felt great after not smoking for 6 weeks, I still couldn‚Äôt wait until I could get back into it again. That was like my prize. ‚ÄúJust pause for 6 weeks, get this job then you‚Äôre free to smoke for the rest of your life‚Äù - this was my mindset/motivation the whole time. 

Once I got the job I picked up right where I left off - smoking everyday again. By this time I had a better idea of how weed was affecting me; I knew once I got to the point where I can‚Äôt eat ANYTHING unless I smoke, things we‚Äôre getting bad. And when I was at my lowest point I would wake up super early in the morning to smoke just so I could eat breakfast before working all day. 

It wasn‚Äôt until late 2019 that I decided that I needed a change. I set a goal for 30 days just to see what happens. During that 30 days of sobriety I was so much more productive. Eventually I moved out of my parents house and I ended up going another 2 more months not smoking - and I loved it - but I knew it wasn‚Äôt permanent. 

This time around when I got back into smoking it wasn‚Äôt like the first time where I threw myself back into it. I would smoke once here and there, not even everyday. I thought that I could become a causal smoker and thought that I finally was able to control it. 

As we all know, that is never the case. Eventually I fell right back into it. But this time it was so much easier because I didn‚Äôt have to sneak around like I did back at my parents. And this was right when covid lockdowns were being placed, so I was stuck in my apartment with nothing to do but smoke. I didn‚Äôt get to the point of smoking in the morning before work, but once I got home I would run straight to the bong. I would always hesitate to make plans right after work because I knew I needed to smoke first before I did anything or went anywhere. 

Fast forward to December 2020, I‚Äôm 28, and here I am again knowing I have a problem and need to stop. Decided to stop cold turkey on the 28th and it‚Äôs been 9 days so far. I know how the first week or so goes, I‚Äôve barely ate anything, it takes so long for me to get to sleep, my emotions are flipping every 30 minutes and the weed cravings come and go all day. The fact that I‚Äôve done this before and I know how much better I‚Äôll feel in the next week or so is what keeps me going. Instead of shooting for 30 days I‚Äôm just going to see how long I can go. Hopefully it can be permanent!! I know its easier said than done but everyday I feel better and better and realize that I never should have gotten so dependent in the first place.

Quitting weed helped a lot in handling the situation better but now I want to go deeper. My father has bipolar for as long as I remember. Earlier I used to shut myself off completely with weed as his episodes got overwhelming to handle after a point. His current manic episode has started maybe a month back and before that it was 2 years of pure depression and not doing anything except watching tv and sleeping. Now he just doesn‚Äôt want to sleep, he‚Äôs up all night and hyperactive all the time. Shouts and gets triggered by random things and gets emotional/angry/frustrated all in a split second. He says he would kill me and immediately regrets it and then continues on rambling about how much he loves me, I know he does. It might sound shallow but the thing that hurts the most honestly is not his words or his behaviour but his reckless spending on things that are not required just because. My family is not in a great financial position and its primarily cause of this disease although I do have a good job. Anyone else going through a similar issue or any suggestions of how to handle it?

I'm 44 and have been smoking and or drinking heavily for 20 years. No kids, I work from home (I'm a software developer so I don't really even talk with people at work on zoom very much), and my relationship is falling apart. My SO it's currently living in the basement mother-in-law unit of the house. The only places that I see other people in the wild are the gym and the dog park, and I often don't have the energy to interact with them. I'm alone most of the time and weed has both made that possible and also encouraged it of course.
My throat hurts nearly constantly now, even though I've always been very functional, never waked/baked, never lost a job or anything over it, and only smoked the evenings, every evening....., every f****** evening for MANY fucking years.

The last couple of times I've tried to stop, have been similar to this one wherein I become increasingly erratic and feel increasingly suicidal when thinking about the hollow vacant lonely nature of the world. I sometimes try to talk to my partner but she doesn't want to hear my s*** because she has been dealing with it forever anyway. To top it off she is sober and cannot understand the struggles of an addict. I've been unfaithful to her when she was gone for months and been distant toward her times, especially during the last couple of years. On the other hand, I haven't asked her for rent and I've paid for everything including her car and phone etc for years. I've done everything I could for her until recently. She only started working again and moved to the basement recently due to the aforementioned problems which were triggered by covid as her family needed some help and they are not in the US.

Beyond the mental challenges and isolation caused by weed, my throat hurts nearly all the time and my heartbeat becomes very erratic when I smoke so I think it will send me to an early grave. On the other hand if I get suicidal whenever I'm abstinent, it what's the difference?

One thing in the marijuana does do is dull the pain by making me forget about life even though it makes me feel worse physically in many cases. 
The emotional pain I deal with every day seems so strange, because I have my house, a decent income, in decent shape and seem to have a lot things going for me but I can barely face the thought of another day grinding through work only to be alone in the evening anyway. I know there are zoom meetings for recovery and stuff but that sounds like stupid s*** to my depressed mind....though I know it would help.

I'm from a relatively small family and have only a couple of friends.  I don't hang out with them a lot and everyone either uses weed or is fine with it. Some are sober from alcohol, but nobody is from weed. I used to talk with my family about my challenges more, but I figure that at some point they don't want to hear that s*** anymore, it's a waste of time for them since I don't change.

God damn, I don't want to act like a whiney baby. How do I stay sober when I don't really have any hope for the future and see each day as a lonely grinding struggle? I feel like my relationship is a big part of the current mental state, and I know it is part of it, but I've been in many relationships over my life and I know by now that some of the deepest problems are in my own mind and won't change. I probably need to find a new one, but it seems like some of these other things need to be resolved first.

I've read many books on addiction and mental health, and though I've learned a lot, I'm sure I've forgotten a lot of it and functionally do almost none of it.

I'm so tired of being in bondage to this substance and the alcohol but I'm also so tired of feeling alone, bored and hopeless as well. What do I do?",22,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8682276}"

It's nice to know that I am not alone in my struggle to quit weed and that it's possible. I used to smoke weed several times a day for several years and finally decided to quit on Jan 1, 2021. It's been 5 days of sobriety and it's been a pleasant change. Like many, I've tried quitting before and relapsed, but this time I am determined to kick the habit for good. I consider myself a ""functional stoner"" which I think made quitting harder. Although I smoked heavily, I did my best to not let weed interfere with my career and relationships. But deep down I knew this habit of smoking 3-4 joints a day is not sustainable. Covid lockdown and working from home full-time didn't help. The past year, I felt my anxiety getting worse. The gap between how I expected to feel after getting high and how I actually felt was widening. There were times when I thought I would never be able to stop smoking weed and felt like a slave to this habit. Even though it's only been 5 days, reading about experiences of others has been helpful. I was always worried that if I stop smoking weed, what would I do with instead? how will I deal with boredom and all the uncomfortable thoughts and feelings that may arise? I was too afraid to face that possibility and wasn't able to quit. I know 5 days without weed doesn't mean much but to me it feels like a massive accomplishment. It seems to be getting easier but I know many challenges lie ahead. I am glad to have found this community. I have to keep reminding myself that if I have been this successful in life smoking weed daily, what would my life be without it?

You may experience:

1. Insomnia

2. A loss of appetite

3.  A ocean of emotions

4. Night sweats/ vivid dreams

For most people that experience bad weed withdrawal, there is usually and underlying emotional problem from your past you have yet to deal with. 

These unaddressed emotions may come to the surface as the weed leaves your system, and you may get emotional, angry, very sad, hating the world, hating yourself etc... 

Recognise all these aspects as symptoms of withdrawal. 

The more intense the emotions, the closer you are to being on the other side of it. 

The weed has been keeping all these emotions suppressed, so as the weed leaves, the emotional problems show up, find out what emotions you were surpressing. 

For most people, after 4 days the worst of it is over, 

For most people, after 6 days you'll be free of it's grasp.

This is when you can start processing the suppressed emotions with clarity. 

But the weed will creep into your mind even after you make it through the tough days. 

At that stage, after the tough days, the weed and it's chains aren't attached to you anymore, you're out of hell, out of prison, then you have to keep making the choice if you want to put those chains back on yourself, or to remain free. 

Addiction is sneaky, you might have great day and think, you know what, I've done great, today was great, and I won't feel guilty about one little smoke, just to reward myself, I deserve it. 

Thats the weed, its lures can morph into many ways to get you back in, do not go back in. 

No one that escapes prison, will return to prison to reward themselves for enjoying their freedom. 

At the start you just want weed because the withdrawals can be bad, but once the withdrawals pass and you feel OK without weed, that's when you have to make the daily choice, not to put back on the chains.

I've put the chains back on many times.

Set yourself free and celebrate your freedom.

Quitting weed is not depriving yourself of what you want, or moving further away from what you need.

The further you move away from the weed the more you gain. 

You gain:

Money

Confidence

Self esteem

You're not self conscious anymore

You're better in conversations

People enjoy talking to you more

Everything gets better.

Life goes from feeling hollow and empty, to full of things to appreciate. 

Have a hobby to go to, very useful to occupy your mind when you feel like putting the chains back on would be a good idea.



UPDATE:  UPDATE:   UPDATE:   UPDATE:  UPDATE:

For me, I was counting how far away from the weed I was getting, setting milestones 1 week, 1 month and so on, which is OK, but my focus was still on the weed. 

I was looking at the weed and walking backwards away from it, and noticing the distance between myself and the weed grow further and further, which is good. 

But at the same time it was like I had a rope tied to it so no matter how far away I got, I could still find my way back. I could follow the milestones back to the weed. 

It's easier to trip walking backwards from a predator. 

It's harder to find safety when your facing away from where you want to escape to. 

We run from the predator, we look forward, and aim away from it, to find the way to safety. 

What we aim at is important, and if you're walking backwards, watching the distance increase, you're still aiming at the weed, aiming at increasing the distance between you and it. 

But watching where you're stepping, is just as important as how far you're stepping. 

Although, with some predators, the right approach is to first walk backwards slowly, and when there is enough distance, we can turn our back to it, and run to freedom. 

So walking backwards is necessary for a certain period of time, and each person will know when they feel at a safe enough distance to turn their back and run free. 

At some stage you must turn your back to it and start moving forward, and trust that the distance between you and it is enough, so that you don't even have to worry about it anymore. 

You're now free, and moving further into life, the weed is way back there somewhere and you don't care how far away it is, or where its location is, it's after someone else now, you escaped, and that's all that matters, now you can forget about that predator.

Just make sure to warn others that it's out there, and where it may be hiding, and how it may attack. 

I'm just pointing out where I got bitten by the snake, so when you get there you can be aware of it, and keep moving forward, and not succumb to the same fate as me when setting milestones.

About a week ago my motor blew in my car and I was completely down and out about it. If I was still smoking those moments of anxiety and depression would be amplified 10x. Instead, I got out of bed, got it diagnosed, went over all my options. Smoking I would‚Äôve been completely numb and I guarantee I would‚Äôve panicked and maybe even gave up. I now realize smoking amplifies even those really bad emotions. I realize how unmotivated I am when I smoke. I was also able to put about 600 dollars more down on a new car Bc I have more money in my pocket without weed. I rode out today in a 2014 Honda, was able to negotiate the price (could barely communicate when I was high) Weed is so insidious and now I can see how the littles things add up. Those times you need to be thinking sharply and on your feet, you are numb and unmotivated. Getting shit done feels so much better than the momentary pleasures of weed. My relationships are better with my parents. We went out to eat to celebrate my new car and had great conversations when I would normally be withdrawn and dull. I say I quit just in time because I don‚Äôt think I would have handled my situation near as well if I was smoking. 

I feel like when I was smoking I was a balloon halfway inflated with helium. I kinda floated along and bounced off the floor. Just was kinda there. Without, I feel fully ‚Äúinflated‚Äù rising to the top, filling out my true potential and purpose.

I feel like I've adapted to the new normal, and have started to become comfortable in my sobriety at this point. Not everything in my life is amazing, but sobriety has allowed me the motivation and focus to work on the things I can improve and acknowledge the things I can't. I roughly feel 90-95% back to the ""before stoner self"", if that's even possible. 

My focus nowadays is on working to maintain sobriety and just accumulate time, rather than adjust to it. I'm not sure I would choose to go to Marijuana Anonymous (MA) on my own volition, but because of a monitoring program I have to participate in, I found myself going several times a week. I have found this super encouraging and supportive, and encourage anyone interested to explore MA (lots of online Zoom meetings are freely available). Bit apprehensive for when I return to school/work in a few months, but taking advantage of my free time now to focus on self-growth and good habits.

 A little more than a month ago I dealt with a major breakup (a 4-year + relationship formed over mutually getting stoned 24/7), and things have been alright - it sucks, but I think it would suck a lot more if I was stoned and using weed not to process it. Been tempted with thoughts of getting out there and trying to date again, but am a bit wary because in the MA community they say not to date in the first year of sobriety.

I knew before i lit up that i didn't need to. I didn't want it THAT bad but the moment i let myself entertain the idea i was done for.

Couldn't not do it because I had talked my self into agreeing with my addition , that i was weaning off, that it wasn't much, that the day had gone well so why not a bit. And after i smoked it i felt a lift maybe, not high though, it wasn't enough. So there i was disappointed with myself and for nothing. Then i realized i could either bash myself up for my mistake or i could prepare for a better day tomorrow. 

So i planned the next day and it went like this:  10 minute yoga video to do in the morning.  a break for lunch (rather than eat at my desk and work/eat). Short walk after work and a HIIT session, then a longggg shower. 

And now its the end of my real day 1. I did everything i planned. when the feeling was back for a nightcap spliff, i smoked a cig instead (which i dont plan on continuing, I'v not been a cig smoker for roughly a year, only have tobacco for the past year-ish with Js). 

thanks for the support all. I won't be scraping the bottom of the drawer the grinder is kept in tonight ! 

in fact, i need to clean that drawer out but something is stopping me..not sure what. the drawer with the grinder and paper and random leftover crumbs is like having one foot out the door. anyone struggle with this? Iv cleaned it out before and thrown out everything only to buy it all again. this time i do feel more motivated then ever before though. Ready to start a new chapter.  But i catch my self every now and then thinking of this as a temporary quit and not a permanent one and i can't figure out why?! My conscious logical mind knows I'm better off not smoking at all ever again.I  have an addict personality, i can finally recognize that. yet i catch my self thinking i might have one one day, and have one every now and then once i know full fact I'm clean and not addicted anymore (say, in a year?). I'm not sure that i could actually be a casual smoker though.

The fact that i kinda dont want to throw everything out and catch my self thinking of this a a temporary quit makes me think i need to be more resolute. but obv i can't just be more resolute. any tips on how to get comfortable with the permanency that i require in this change ?",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4606099}"

Looking back at what I thought were Pros for staying or cons for leaving is interesting.  I will go over each one of those and come up with a reason why I see them differently now.  Updated response in brackets ** [].

The Cons of Staying and Pros of leaving are still pretty accurate.  That first month away from weed gave me a lot of solid clarity on that front.


Pros of staying:

* makes me feel good to be part of the tribe  
** [I now realize that weed was generally giving me a false connection to nostalgia for old friends and times that have moved on]

* relaxing to look forward to after a hard day  
** [Turns out I was just tired at the end of everyday from being high all the time.  Now I am getting REAL relaxation when needed]
* something to help make boring activities more interesting  
** [listening to a podcast is a better way to make projects and chores more interesting]
* goes well with music  
** [Music is different without weed.  Maybe better.  I definitely don't feel like I am missing out on the music due to weed anymore] 
* prefer weed buzz to booze buzz  
** [It's not either or.  I can have the occasional beer or two.  I don't have the same pull to being drunk]
* seems to comfort some anxieties  
** [overall, the anxiety rollercoaster when using weed everyday is MUCH worse. I still have my moments, but i am calmed just by knowing i am not high all the time.  The weed life itself was the cause of a lot of stress and worry]


Cons of staying:

* feel stuck in a rut for quite some time
* hard to get moving in the morning, tendency to hit snooze
* physical heavy/tired feeling. (like if I smoke on a hike)
* can‚Äôt control my munchies. Eating way too much sugar, fat, salt, junk
* feel paranoid hanging around people that don‚Äôt realize I am high
* risky driving situations
* watching tv shows, youtube, and movies and barely remembering them the next day.
* not able to limit toking to just weekends, always becomes a daily habit
* lung damage concerns. Who really knows long term impact of random vape cartridges, etc



Pros of leaving:

* no more hiding a secret life/habit
* feeling clear headed and up in the mornings
* using time more effectively in general
* eating less junk
* tacking some new healthy habits with my extra time and energy
* $ saved
* no more worrying about pot breath and red eyes


Cons of leaving:

* feels like a strange thing to do as mj is legal in my state  
** [gambling is legal too, but i don't do it because I know it's not good for my life]
* missing a release mechanism in my life  
** [I have learned that a good walk, working on a home project, or a long bike ride are better release mechanisms]
* withdrawal symptoms are an uncomfortable hassle  
** [very true, but necessary to break through to the better way of life for me]
* anxiety through the roof  
** [True again.  The anxiety in the first month can be almost too much to take.  But the payoff is worth it and I have experienced it myself a few times in the past 2ish years]
* missing that happy little spark that mj brought to my life  
** [this feeling faded.  Now I can get a happy spark just by knowing I wake up to another day where I am free of the weed life]
* feeling like i am missing something when I hear certain music  
** [Sorry Phish, lol]
* feel like a normal/square in general. Is it selling out?  
** [Over 25 years in the weed life... I think I have done enough time to try something new.  I have also learned that i can't just become a square.  All those past party years and experiences are still in me.]
* sort of miss eating all the delicious junk food with the munchies  
** [I have since learned the hard way that abusing bad food is not ONLY a weed/munchies thing.]

Weed has been my helper when it comes to trauma as my mom passed when I was 11. 

I recently have gotten into reading about ‚Äúawakening‚Äù and that ‚Äúyou are not your thoughts‚Äù (Eckhart Tolle)lots of meditation and journaling. Through this I realized I don‚Äôt think I can go down the path of awakening with my green buddy next to me. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs been stunting my growth for a long time.

Decided to quit on Jan 3 back on Christmas so I smoked a bunch before then smh

I was on Day 2 and had sat up two nights in a row. I caved just to get some sleep at 4 am the second night. I tried drinking two cups of sleepy time tea and that didn‚Äôt work before bed like it did on the first night. I‚Äôm fine during the day (besides cravings) as I exercise regularly and have things to distract me and support from my partner. 

Not sure if going cold turkey after such heavy usage is a good idea. Right now I‚Äôm only smoking literally at like 1 am if I can‚Äôt get sleep. Then I‚Äôm hoping it will be easier to let go next week. 

I was still very emotional in the morning, realizing how hard it was and that I caved in. I‚Äôm very hard on myself normally so this was rough too. Just really overwhelming trying to change everything at once

Hello everyone, first just wanted to say how grateful I am for this community. You all are so compassionate and kind and I applaud you all for trying to heal and better your lives. I will try to focus on the specific information I‚Äôd like to share for brevity‚Äôs sake, but I‚Äôm happy to share my experience if anyone is interested. 

Since I quit smoking my dreams have returned full force. Everyone knows weed disrupts dreaming. Even though sometimes they are uncomfortable and weird I look forward to them every night because I feel like I‚Äôm learning so much from them. I‚Äôm remembering traumatic events from my childhood that I think may have led me to start abusing weed and other drugs at age 15. I started reading a book called ‚ÄúThe Body keeps the Score‚Äù which I recommend if you have experienced trauma of any kind in your life (however, I will warn you the book itself is sometimes graphic in descriptions of child abuse, war trauma, etc., that may be triggering for some individuals). I was reading in the book about how REM sleep (which is when we dream) is essential for processing and integrating memories, including painful ones. I was curious about how weed might affect REM sleep and turns out studies show that it does reduce it. Now that I‚Äôm sober for the first time in 18 years I am having to relive the memory of painful things from my childhood as if they happened yesterday. I realized that I subconsciously started smoking to suppress those painful memories because I just wasn‚Äôt ready to deal with them at the time. I‚Äôm sharing this information with the hope that anyone else out there struggling may gain some insight as to why they are stuck in this cycle. There are so many reasons to quit and everyone‚Äôs story is different, but I just wanted to emphasize how essential it is for us to dream so that we can free our brains to be creative and imaginative about the future and not get stuck in the past. I still deal with cravings but one of my biggest motivations right now, strangely enough, is not to smoke so that I can remember my dreams because I feel like on some level I‚Äôm healing a little more each night that I can be aware and honest with myself about what happened in my past. 

I don‚Äôt want to get too long winded but I‚Äôm happy to share more if anyone has any questions. Just putting that out there in case that information is relevant to anyone else because looking back through this sub‚Äôs history I haven‚Äôt found a similar post (unless I didn‚Äôt look hard enough). 

I was going to link the website I found about marijuana and REM sleep but changed my mind bc it has somewhat of a weed-positive perspective as weed as a sleep enhancer even though it sadly outlines how it negatively affects the quality of your sleep so I decided not to include it. There is plenty of research out there though if you‚Äôre interested. 

Happy sobriety everyone!

Edit: I realized I didn‚Äôt include any info on how to actually heal the trauma, besides dreaming about it. Just wanted to quickly include that the book recommends: breathing exercises (focusing on a long exhale); yoga, tai chi, or other movement-based meditations (to get back ‚Äúin‚Äù your body and out of your mind); writing letters to yourself; theater/dance (to express the trauma); biofeedback; and an emerging therapy called EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) which is thought to mimic REM (rapid eye movements) while awake. Hope that helps!

Edit 2: Thanks so much for all of the awards and thoughtful contributions to the discussion! Whatever your experience may be, it‚Äôs valid and I thank you for sharing. I almost didn‚Äôt post this but I‚Äôm happy I did. I had no idea so many people would have relevant experiences. It really just goes to show that the old adage ‚ÄúBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle,‚Äù is so true and we need kindness more than ever. Thank you all for your kindness and compassion, I need to get to sleep now but I‚Äôll try to get the rest of your replies tomorrow. :)",617,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46664444}"

I'm currently 21 yo. I'm brazillian, born and living in Brazil since my birth. Been smoking pot since 16 years, but since my 18 I've been in heavy use and using it to do absolutely EVERYTHING .

I've suffered from anxiety and depression since 14. Weed just gets it worse with time, trust me. Two years ago, I've been hit by a railroad train while riding a horse and lost my left hand. A traumatic amputation. Did it stop me from going back to cigarretes, alcohol, WEED and even coke? Hell no. I've always been in the urge for something that makes me feel good, all my whole life.

What saddens me the most: I'm a capable, smart and kind guy. People have always said those things to me. By that age, I've should have a major degree in something, or at least be studying in a college, with a car in my garage or anything like that. But no, so far weed have taken everything away from me, my health, my money (approximately R$30.000,00 in BR currency or US$7.000,00) - my life savings were all spend in weed - which, btw, is terrible quality here in Brazil - my opportunities and even dates with some of the coolest, nicest looking chicks I've known. Everything was given to me at birth - I was just spected to grab it and go for it - and even then, I failed. Weed is the worst false friend you could meet in your life.

&#x200B;

So, a while ago, like two months, after quitting on cigarretes, cocaine (which I only managed to quit by discounting all that pleasure and money on weed), I decided to quit on the devil's lettuce as well.

Since then, I've been 1 or 2 weeks without it, having trouble sleeping, waking, socializing, being motivated and happy, only to buy a small amount, roll the first joint and get nothing good from it, except disappointment and tears in my eyes. So I always throw it all away in the toilet, flush and start over my quest to soberness. But I know it's worth it! nothing good comes from the easy, cozy place that weed locks us in when we're on it - and even when we're just in the hangover from it.

&#x200B;

Life is definetely not easy guys, I can assure you that, and starting from groung 0 is indeed harsh, but is the ONLY worthy, true and achiavable way to get to the so wanted place of peace and hapiness we all long for in this world. Won't going back this time now, I've lost enough in this life so far.

For background, I smoked daily for about 2.5 years. I've taken breaks before and felt ""hungover"" for a day around day 2 and then it was over. I didn't get the hangover feeling at all this time around.

I felt nothing bad for 11 days. On day 12 though, I woke up with a mild fever (normal is 96.8F for me, my current temp is 98.1F). Things got worse throughout the day. I started to feel shakey, nauseous, and had an elevated heart rate (between 80-100 bpm). It feels like having a mild panic attack for a very long time.

I didn't sleep well last night. I couldn't lower my heart rate below 80 bpm despite my breathing excercises. I kept getting chills, then sweats, then chills again. I called in sick to work today because I still feel shakey and nauseous...

I've heard that people who smoke a lot can get a ""flu"" during withdraw. Is this my flu? How long did this last for you?

I just wanted to share a technique that is working for me so far (5 days sober). So my typical day was like this for the past 3 years: Wake up - do a little bit of studying (I'm a phd student) - get urges to smoke or something sad happens - smoke until bedtime - regret - decide not to smoke tomorrow - wake up...

My decision to smoke is always momentary. And then comes the regret, but I'm already high, so why not wait until tomorrow.

In order to break this pattern, I decided to smoke if only it made sense for 24 hours straight (In other words, if I had urges for 24 hours straight). So, I might get an urge in the evening, but I wait until the next morning to see if I'll be happy for not smoking, or if I still had urges. So far, I woke up happy for not smoking the previous night for 5 days straight.

First I want to express how thankful I am for this subreddit existing. I‚Äôve almost caved into smoking weed many times, where that urge was reduced after reading about all y‚Äôall testimonies :) 

To those of you who are in the early days like myself, I‚Äôve found that every day gets generally easier. I thought that being sober would destroy my creativity, sense of self, cognitive capacity, empathy for others. While those things were barely existent in the beginning of sobriety, each day they slowly come back. I‚Äôve spent the last two days writing and recording music, and boy, I have been so much more productive than my high-days. I can stay focused on the task with much more success, and I don‚Äôt get carried away with doubtful thoughts.

One thing that is really bothering me, is that my sense of humour has not returned yet. I haven‚Äôt laughed in what feels like two weeks, and literally everything I watch (movies, shows, comedies) are not interesting in the slightest. I used to be quite humorous and jovial in the company of others, and because nothing is funny, it is refraining me from socialising.

I took my first hit at a party when I was 20, by 25 I had ""dedicated"" my life to the plant (working in the weed industry), moved at 28 and couldnt find a regular supply so I was on again/off again, started taking hits from my roomie at 30, at 31 I moved out of the country and cut down to about 1 bowl a day, at 32 I moved back and weed became ""legal"" in my state and it was the total downfall of me, smoking practically every day before & after work (and sometimes during).

For the past 2 years I have struggled with my addiction and have tried to stop more times than I can count, failed with varying degrees each time. The longest I went was in 2020 on my 35th birthday, about a month into lockdown, I made the decision to totally stop again. I stayed clean for 2 1/2 months.

Those 2 1/2 months that I was sober were amazing. I was accomplishing more in shorter periods of time, my motivation and drive were at levels I hadn't experienced in awhile. I talked to my family & friends more (I am naturally an introvert & as some of you know all too well, weed is a comfortably dangerous drug for our kind), and I was actually going out and doing things that I've been putting off for awhile.

After the lockdown was lifted, the first week into work again and I broke down, bought a joint, and smoked it on a day off. I figured ""lets see how I like this now that I've been good for over 2 months"" ""will I get totally baked? will I hate it?"" It only took another week until I was smoking pretty much every day again.

Everything got locked down again almost 2 months ago, and I've been unemployed and getting baked every day, all day. My consumption was totally out of control (roughly 2-3g a day, not including kief & shatter which was also turning into a daily habit). First I decided on christmas to stop, as a christmas present for myself. When christmas came & went, I then chose New Years Day. 

I finally bit the bullet today, 1/4/20, and havent smoked at all. This time is going to work, I can feel it. I really dont want to live in the haze and the clouds anymore. I want my feet firmly planted on the ground. I want to live in reality and not some artifical universe that makes me paranoid, anxious, depressed, lonely, lazy, & dulled.

Hi guys I'm 23 years old and i been struggling with weed use for the past year making a year and a few months by today. a little backstory...

I am a driver who is aspiring to go back to college ( no idea how, but smoking definitely doesn't help) I also consider myself a big time BJJ athlete which also happens to be my second addiction. These 3 aspects of my life; work, BJJ, and weed dominate my life. 

I recently got discharged from the military and basically it has given me a shitty identify to think back on resulting in shitty confidence everywhere I go ‚Ä¶ which is why Jiu Jitsu and weed are the only things that help me. Except, my dating life has gone to shit, I don't talk to my friends as extrovertedly as I used to, I feel like it has worsened my ADHD, I cant focus on a conversation and the list goes on ...

Honestly i know you guys hear this all the time so I just want to cut to the chase 

I FEEL STUCK :( It feels impossible to consider a different routine because when I find time I'm always getting high to deal with emotional trauma i dealt with two shitty relationships (almost married twice) and some neurosis that I probably got from psychedelic use this past year to ""try and face my truth"". 

I left a lot of stuff out but really... I know somewhere deep down inside I truly want to be happy without weed but see it impossible. 

I feel like Jiu Jitsu is literally the only thing keeping me sane and is the only thing I'm doing good in my life. Please shed some light on how I could move forward. Thank you everybody.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6391475}"

It helped me very much for many years.

2021-01-04 22:32:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kqpjh2/the_slow_decline_of_my_relationship_with_weed/,The slow decline of my relationship with weed.,"I remember when I first did weed 4 years ago and it was just a great time. I remember feeling like it was one of the greatest moments of my life and that the drug was ""for me"". A year later I started doing it regularly and experiences varied from good to great, and it went on that way for nearly two years. I never really ever did it daily but went a few times a week when I hung out with friends, and they weren't always in town so I often had breaks to reset. As time went on experiences ranged from okay to great, and then okay to good, and now I feel like I am at bad to okay. Things took a noticeable dip last year when I had a traumatic experience with a tornado that I think triggered some anxiety within me that just became enhanced by weed. This just accelerated that decline. 

It's strange, because even after T breaks of varying degree it literally just doesn't hit like it used to. For whatever reason, I always feel like I'm fighting off anxiety while high and depression after coming down. And I just feel notably better while sober, but still kind of down. I get bored for a while and when I hang out with my friends I think ""why not?"" and then I'm immediately reminded that **what weed used to do for me just doesn't exist anymore**. It's no longer a mood enhancer but a mood downer that causes me to slightly disassociate and feel like my life is happening as a movie and I'm watching. Not to mention it increases symptoms of my health anxiety and I often think something is going wrong with my heart. I don't know, I vowed not to do anymore, and yesterday I ended up doing some anyways, just small puffs, and it was the same anxiety and the worst come down of my life. 

It just sucks because life has never felt more repetitive for me, and every once in a while I crave that ""hit"" of adding magic to everyday experience, but I'm not even allowed that anymore. It looks like I'm just gonna have to rawdog life for a good long while.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7514785}"

2021-01-04 20:30:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kqnas1/8_months_and_23_days_sober/,8 months and 23 days sober,"Hey all! This subreddit was super useful for me when I was starting out on this path. Decided to check in with my experience quitting and hopefully encourage some of you. Here's my story: 

I (29/m) started smoking pot when I was 15, and it wasn't long before I was blazing up every day. While in high school I would frequently get stoned by myself on the way to the bus stop, and at night I'd get stoned by myself in my room. I smoked weed basically every day, often multiple times a day for more than a decade. Why? I think I wanted an escape from the tedium of my every day --living in the suburbs as a kid, wanting to live the life of a creative person and being fed messages that drug use was somehow linked to creativity, it seemed important that I alter my consciousness. As I grew into a young adult and touring musician, I was surrounded by weed at every turn. It was deeply embedded in the culture of songwriting, playing shows --no matter where I found myself in the world, someone had a joint. Although I could think of dozens of ways that it was holding me back and had diminished my capacity in various situations, I justified it by pointing to the changing status quo in our society. It felt weird to admit I had a problem while my country (Canada) was beginning to open weed stores on every block. 

I've always been a pretty neurotic person and somewhat over-achieving. I got solid grades in spite of my drug use, I got a masters degree, I became self employed by the age of 27. But the reality is that I used those external markers of success to hide from the fact that I had serious addiction issues. I was deeply afraid of the person I was when I was sober. I felt like I would crash and burn from anxiety, from my obsessive thought spirals. I was scared my friends wouldn't like me sober. I was scared that I wouldn't be able to write music or live a creative life, so linked it was to my studio practice. 

However, here I am almost 9 months sober and I am thriving! I have had a moderate amount of anxiety (which I think is understandable given the current covid-19 pandemic), but otherwise my mental health has largely improved. I've achieved several big goals, including finalizing and releasing my first solo album on vinyl and new milestones in physical fitness. My confidence is way up. I am facing a lot of my demons head on and loving the mental clarity that sobriety has offered me --I have read like 25 books since getting sober. And according to my phone's tracking app, I've saved around $700 in weed money. My relationship has also flourished because sobriety is helping me to be more emotionally available with my girlfriend. 

Things to know:   
\- Withdrawals are real. At least they were for me. I had serious GI issues that started around week 3 and lasted for a few weeks. Crushing pain and cramps in my stomach that I can only attribute to my body re-calibrating itself. Way worse than I ever thought possible.  
\- Life gets easier when you get sober. It might seem hard to believe if you are struggling, but the truth is that buying weed, smoking weed, thinking about weed, staying high, and managing life is a lot more work than just living free.   
\- For many of us, weed is a coping mechanism. If you want to stay clean, it's important to replace this unhealthy coping mechanism with a healthy one. For me, it was riding my bike, meditating, writing in my journal, doing yoga etc. Doing small productive things that are healthy builds confidence that compounds long term. I also read a lot of motivational books in the early days: David Goggins, Rich Roll, John Joseph etc. Getting in the right mindset was important for me.   
\-If you're scared of quitting that is exactly why you should do it. Fear lets you know that you're doing something right. 

TL;DR: I quit smoking weed cold turkey after \~13 years of daily use and my life has improved.

Probably didn't help that it was my first full day off since I stopped either.

Anyway my best friend & I had planned to hangout today & regardless of when or where we hangout we would always make sure to smoke before doing anything else. It got to the point where if he came to my place or I came to his we would each walk right to the smoking area when we got there & the other would come out. He knew I was stopping, so instead of going to our usual spot he came right inside & that honestly helped so much not having to go into our usual smoking spot.

Instead we just spent a few hours finishing up an anime we had been watching & talked a bit. He even said he was thinking about stopping for a bit too! So despite today's cravings hitting hard I was lucky enough to hangout with a friend who understood what I was going through (he's been trying to keep up to date with how stopping was since I started, with cravings & whatnot) & did everything he could to make sure I didn't want to smoke.

Day 3
No cravings all day while at work. My coworker was hitting his bong on lunch break and that was a little bit of a jolt, but nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle. Normally he and I would go 1-3 bowls deep on either of our lunch breaks. I found that I was able to work so much harder and I got way more done before my shift was over. 

Cravings didn‚Äôt happen til I was off work, around 4PM, and I really wanted to stop by a dispensary or find some way to get high, but I managed to ride the waves out and get home to my brothers without any stops along the way. The biggest help I had against it was the two videos I‚Äôd left myself the prior mornings. Every day since day 2 I‚Äôve been leaving 45 second video messages for myself. Day 2 I was throwing up, nauseous and unhappy, and that video I made sure to tell myself to stay strong unless I wanted to be back to the withdrawal symptoms. Day 3‚Äôs video is more kind. Day 4 is funny. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do with the videos after I get through more of this.

Melatonin is a godsend for knocking me out, and I find that I don‚Äôt stay up playing video games til 1am anymore, I try to get in bed by 11:30pm which is a new development. And I‚Äôm not as tired. I remember when anyone asked how I was I feel like my answer was always tired. I‚Äôm not tired anymore.

Feel like all of my enjoyment in life starts with getting high first,"I'm becoming increasingly aware of my problem, mostly because of how much money I spend on it a month, which can sometimes be upwards of $500. 

I started smoking about 3 years ago, just tiny amounts. But now I'm at a point where I'm blowing through half an ounce a week ($140). I feel like I need it. My job can be very stressful(and would probably can me if they found out I was THC-positive), and at the end of the day, it's the one thing that helps me turn my mind off so I can enjoy music, tv, or a video game. Thinking of not having weed, makes me think I won't enjoy these activities anymore. I sometimes smoke before work, but I try to refrain until I'm home, done with gym and everything I needed to do. On the weekends though, I'm more or less high all day unless for some reason I can't get my hands on it. I literally smoke before any social gathering, and even before hockey games because I think it ""relaxes"" me. 

I have goals, and want to move one day. I'm turning 30 and want to pay off one more credit card so I can move. An extra $500 a month towards this debt would be lifechanging, and would make the move happen all the faster. I'm just so scared of not being able to deal with my own scatter-brained, anxious self at night, when I'm all alone with nothing else to do. I won't find video games fun, enjoy music as much, get engulfed in a good TV show anymore.

I made it to day 100. 
The first days were like having a flu, then came anger or being thin skinned emotionally for quiete a while.
And then I was suddenly fine. Good. Light. Positive.
Could not imagine why I told myself so long that it is part of me.

Since then I noticed more and more that I have to become active to tackle all my issues that I treated with MJ.
Anxiety mainly and worrying in circles and circels.

So I started meditation, Yoga Nidra and also light Yoga stretches and began to read books again.

I don't wanna say it is not working. Just that I guess I am a very impatient person. Am kind of pissed at myself for not progressing quicker. Brain is slow still, memory okish, but often I feel still sluggish.

That said I am a dad of 3,5 and 1,5 year old and am watching the kids during the day while my wife works for 5-6 hours. Then I tr to do some tutorials for new joblife, then together kids till betime and then sport/meditation. 

Guess I am just tired being a (very happy) dad in covid times with no daycare. The big one can go a bit to grandparents during day. But my wonderful small one is not really having naps and so we spend all the time doing something together. Whoever has a 1,5 year old knows what I mean.

I have to remind myself to be proud of getting away from MJ. Wanted to be a dad who is here and now, as well as someone who finds a job that is meaning and pleasure. 
Am just in the transition. My best friend is rockin the fulltimejob while watching his 3 year old also a lot during day, working nights with nearly no sleep etc. So I think I have some doing an incredible job to compare myself to.

I even started using ankidroid cards and reading about how to learn (spaced repetition) so that I would learn better and more. But to be honest my capacity is just not there (yet?)

Sorry for rambling!

I do not miss MJ a bit.
And do not want to blame myself or her for how much time I wasted in which I could have learned things. That is no use.

But yes. I hope my efforts of active tackling it will.pay out, anxiety will get better, worries a bit softer, body core a bit stronger and me overall happier.

Wish you all the best!

I started here with /r/leaves in Aug 2018 and aside from a couple of stumbles, I have been living the good life weed free ever since.  I have about 24 out of the past 29 months in the clear.  My last stumble was at the beginning of the lockdown where I live.  I lost a few weeks back to the ditch, but I am glad that I got back on track relatively quickly.  The relapses were filled with regret now that I have experienced so many of the positives of the weed free side of things. This has been a huge positive change after being a daily user since 1992.

* no more worrying about being caught being high (driving or otherwise)
* no worries about drug test for any upcoming work
* not feeling like I am hiding something from so many people in my life
* no more concerns about my cardio/lung health
* no more extreme munchie episodes
* far less anxiety
* more clarity and patience for introspection
* less emotional peaks and valleys
* a more confident and positive outlook on every day and the future
* no more mid day exhaustion and sleepiness
* much better sleep quality
* not feeling foggy in the morning
* integrating positive new habits over time (flossing, biking, learning spanish, waking up before 7, journaling, etc)

I've managed to quit periodically during this time, with my longest being 2 months, but I always ended up going back to it. I always felt I wasn't quite finished with weed.

Coming into 2021 I was ready to give it up for good. I feel like our relationship has run its course now and its the most determined I've felt to quit for good. So far i'm on day 4!

Then I received the news that the UK is likely to go back into a full lock-down. My very first thought was 'okay this sucks, lock-downs are so boring maybe I'll go back to smoking and try quit again when lock-down is over.'

I managed to talk myself out of by remembering that life will ALWAYS give you an excuse to go back to the plant. And the 'perfect time to quit' just does't exist. So I resisted, carried on with my day and now looking towards day 5 of no weed.

I just wanted to post this in case anyone else has had these thoughts given the current state of the world. There will always be an excuse to smoke weed, and its just reminding yourself of that when your brain tries to justify it.

I still have cravings which aren't too intense, and I no longer have night sweats, headaches or nausea but goddamn the depression, lack of motivation, anxiety, insomnia, and brain fog are still very much present. It was better today, better than it's been in awhile which has given me hope that I haven't permanently damaged my brain. I've been going through moments where I think I'm schizo or I have psychosis but it's much less frequent now than it was a week or two into withdrawals and today felt like a big step in the right direction

If anyone else is also around 2 months and experiencing similar feelings, such as frequent confusion, having trouble explaining things because it feels like there's a mental block, depression, extreme lack of motivation, or anything along those lines, I'd love to hear about it. It would definitely make me feel better.

If you recently gave up marijuana, please don't let my personal experience discourage you. I know for a fact that whatever the fuck I'm experiencing isn't the same for everyone, pretty certain it isn't even that common, so stay committed.

If you're reading this and struggling with quitting, i think the best approach is to find that reason WHY you quit and stick with it. It gets better. Quitting won;t end your life, and it won't hurt you. It is totally possible, and at hte moment it will take all your willpower but overtime you will get more powerful and see that all you needed to do was take that leap of faith, because that is what it is. I felt so dark, and so caught up in the bud prior to my quitting.  I couldn't imagine even a day without the stuff. It was genuine dread. I have been there, like you may be now. But as many people s ay, quitting and the desire to quit has to come from intrinsically inside of YOU. Other people can't magically make you quit. You need to exercise that willpower and determination and adaptability that has allowed the human race to survive and THRIVE over the last x amount of Millenia that we have walked the earth.

Needless to say, I definitely regretted it. The only issue is now I find myself going back and forth a lot more on whether I should stop. I always think of a new way to moderate and that maybe this time will be different. In this case I‚Äôm thinking that maybe if I switched to a dab pen at night, it wouldn‚Äôt be as bad. 

I‚Äôm used to smoking a bong at night and I‚Äôve found that leads to me chugging coffee the next day and trying to stave off the grogginess and mental fog.

I have dabbled with complete sobriety several times throughout my smoking life, and always returned because the severity of my addictions hadn't ever gone 'over the line'.

The line in question? Using during work hours.

For many years now I considered myself a functional alcoholic who enjoyed being high. Never did I consider smoking an addiction because I held on to a magical checklist of things that I *haven't* done that allows me to phrase the question of addiction in a specific way.

Am I using during work hours?
Has it caused me to lose a job?
Am I abusive to others around me? et cetera.

The list goes on, but over the festive period, whilst working at home I smoked when I should have been working. 

It was just a sudden idea that only remained an idea for an iota of a second before I had picked up my tin and started packing the grinder. 

I had an hour or so left before I was due to log off, my partner left the house for a walk, my boss had logged off early and I thought ""Hey, quick blaze and some games before settling in for an evening with my partner"".

That was it, in my mind I justified it as 'It's Christmas, no one will no and it will affect no one but myself"". No harm no foul, right?

Well, that for me, is the end of the show. It took  me a week or so to come to terms with it but I know now that every little inch of leigh way I have given myself was only slowing down the process towards full on oblivion.

I am a month sober from alcohol, only drinking on Christmas Day and New Years Eve and on my second day of being smoke free.

Time to pack up shop and get on with getting on.

I could not understand what was the issue. I could never express excitement (even when I was sober. To the point my boyfriend exclaimed he never knew if I was excited about something. Simply put: I felt I had no more life inside me and this was scary). 

I used being so social and now I was avoiding going out because I was always too high at the end of the day to meet up with friends who didnt smoke. I also got bored in every social event, being eager to go back home to smoke and be on the couch watching whatever (and falling asleep before the movie would end). Smoking was literally better than anything and when I realized this, I panicked. My life cannot revolve around weed.

In reality though, when I was sober, I wanted to smoke, yet, when I was high, I was eager to be sober again. The feeling of being high was not as great as the expectation from it. Once I realized this, I decided it was time to say bye-bye and accept weed no longer has a place in my life. Currently in day 4 after 10+ years of smoking and so far it has been easier than I thought, simply because I hated the person I was becoming and this motivates me to say no (even if my partner still smokes).

If you have issues and feel like relapsing, remember you are doing this for a better life. Don't focus on what you are losing from not smoking (being numb and ''relaxed''), think of what you will gain if you say no (energy, motivation, friends, a social life, sports, career advancement).

What has changed since then? Everything. I changed my entire life around in an effort to, and as a result of, stopping weed. Hours and large parts of my day can go by and I don't even think about weed anymore. The holiday break had some moments, not moments where I *wanted* to use weed but moments where I normally would use weed so of course those thoughts bubble up. I want to be sober, I appreciate what living a sober life has done for me and so I will continue that. As with when I quit alcohol years ago I know that there will be certain times and certain situations that will cause those thoughts to arise. It's fine, I'm prepared, I recognize they are merely thoughts caused by old patterns and old habits. I let them pass by. 

Its been a while since I've been in control of my life like this, in control of my thoughts, my goals and where my life is headed in general.

I've come to learn more about myself and other bad behaviors I developed over the years (shitty sleep hygine, phone addiction, avoidance behavoir, motivational problems, etc). Now I can work on those instead of blaming everything on weed and using it as an excuse to not move forward in life.

I am mentally ready to stop smoking. I know that it is holding me back and is keeping me from living my life to the fullest. But I am extremely nervous about some of the side effects to quitting that I know are coming. In the past when I have gone multiple days without smoking my biggest issues have been...

1) Lack of appetite. I can‚Äôt eat anything. I have less than zero appetite. Looking at food makes me feel sick and I when I am eating, the food tastes horrible. I can‚Äôt even force myself to eat. It‚Äôs like trying to eat when you‚Äôre completely full.  

2) Going to the bathroom. This may be because of the lack of appetite but when I‚Äôm not smoking it seems like it‚Äôs impossible for me to take a shit. 

3) No sleep. If I don‚Äôt smoke before bed I toss and turn all night without sleeping. This will happen even if I‚Äôve run out of weed during the day and can‚Äôt smoke at night. 

The lack of appetite and bowel movements I can deal with, but would love some advice on how others have dealt with it. 

But the lack of sleep is something that ruins the next day at work. How can I get to sleep easier these first few nights?

my name is Thomas and I live in the Netherlands. I am 19 years young and today I decided to quit my weed habit. I started using back when I was 15 and this drug really wrapped around me fast! In the beginning it felt like the most amazing thing ever. Even the most stupid thing would amaze me. I already quit for about 4 months before but this time I don't want to slip back. 

- The first trick i use is being in this subreddit! The reason I started writing my post is because I could not stop thinking about going to the shop to buy some weed. (there are like 4 places to buy it in a 5km radius from my house) 

- The second trick is making my bad habit invisible. I threw away all the cues that made me think about weed; a lighter, rolling paper, empty bags and so on. I am also reducing my exposure to weed; only meeting my friends on voicechat while playing a game. Not meeting up physically while they are lighting up a joint. And trying to avoid walking past the shop. 

- The third trick; highlighting the benefits of quitting weed when I think about it. (improved memory and better mood as an example)

- The fourth trick; make it difficult to do. Not taking my ID or money with me when I go out the door. (I need this to buy weed)

- The last trick; make it satisfying. I am currently using a habit tracker. It is a piece of paper that shows al the thing I want and don't want to do. Every evening I use a coloured pencil and next to the correct date I place a dot beneath the habit I successfully did. 

I know I did not tell the whole story of my life but I wanted to keep it short. If you have a tip for me or think my tips are good leave a comment bellow! To everyone reading I wish you a happy 2021 and good luck quitting your bad habits :)",18,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.541427}"

I've ALWAYS slept great, even before I started smoking a few years ago. I love going to bed early & I would always sleep through the night with no problem.

Now in the winter months I've been either so bored or depressed that I go to sleep between 20:00 & 21:30 each night & either wake up for good at 4:00 unable to fall back asleep or in the middle of the night after a bad dream, drenched in sweat, etc. (you get the picture I'm sure). 

I also suffer from anxiety and something that triggers that and a whole bunch of anger is when I can't sleep, and I don't know how to deal.

I‚Äôve smoked pretty much daily for the past four years, and have finally decided to stop as I‚Äôve realized how badly weed usage has been affecting my mental health. It was fine and really didn‚Äôt affect me much until about a year ago. 

I‚Äôve been stuck in this ruthless cycle of wanting to quit but not feeling like it was the right time for myself for months now. I realized it‚Äôs made me a terrible person. If my previous partner wanted me to be sober around him it was so difficult for me, and I‚Äôd sneak hits when he wasn‚Äôt looking. I couldn‚Äôt function without weed anymore, even though when I got high it sent me into a spiral of depression and anxiety. 

My recent breakup was what finally pushed me to end the cycle. I became a shitty person and a shittier partner when I smoked, and I was well aware of this, but I just... couldn‚Äôt stop. Him leaving finally made me realize that I fucking hated the person I had become. I realized that I need to do better, be better, and stop letting myself fall into this cycle of addiction.

Some context for myself. I am 22 years old at the moment, I first tried cannabis when I was 12 years old, and at the age of 14 my mother died, within this time period I started a indolence of weed every single day to cope, I guess. After school I would be high till I went to sleep, eventually around 17 I would smoke before school, during lunch hour and continue smoking when I got home. 

The past few years I have felt the need to quit due to social problems that I had never really gotten over, in fact I believe they have gone unchecked and I enjoyed spending nearly everyday alone just getting high and not getting much done at all, my life care at the time went as well. I had a psychotic break during the summer when I was 20, I punched my walls a bunch and broke my right hand punching a brick wall. I was frustrated not being able to function in the world, not being able to get a job due to my problems that mostly revolved around cannabis consumption. 

After breaking my hand I was able to finally to get a job washing dishes, which is fine as I had gotten sober for about a month of working. But, I then started back up with the weed, slowly but surely my life seemed to spiral into the void. I was fine before working, 60 hours a week, it brought me happiness that I finally had a purpose in the world. But, good things never seem to last for me, once I started smoking again seemed like all my problems and thoughts started to come up again about how much I hate myself and my job has no point even though I was making 2500$ a month easily and didn‚Äôt have to spend a dime on anything. My hours got cut in the winter time, and with so much time after work I started to once again smoke every single day, during my last month I started to do LSD tabs every single day after I got off of work for a whole 30 days. That and cannabis seemed like my only ‚Äòhappiness‚Äô I got out of life, as my pay was cut to about a 1000$, which dwelt on my mind heavy. During, the last week I worked, I was having an inner battle with myself, and I didn‚Äôt have much to do at work so I cleaned my area over and over again till it shined. Without any work to actually do my mind trailed off into why I was even here at work, so one day in the middle of my shift I dropped what I was doing and just left and never came back, didn‚Äôt answer calls or anything. I only lasted 4 months working. 

After the winter I quit all psychedelics, and switched to concentrates which I consumed about 3-5 grams a week for 50$ a gram which slowly but surely ate all the money I made while working. Eventually corona hit and I was quitting once every few months.

Flash forward to now, I have beaten my addiction, I smoked Christmas Day, but before that was 2 months ago and before that time was another 2 months. I still don‚Äôt feel alright I guess, and am slowly building myself up again, I still feel like a child like I never matured, all my friends have passed me by in life going to school, having boughten houses, cars and gotten married. I still feel stuck I guess, but I‚Äôm extremely hopeful with what I have learned from my self suffrage that I can over coke anything life has to throw at me. I have recently gotten back into my hobbies that I like doing, getting happiness from else where but drugs. And have been slowly applying to places to work again. 

I know it will be hard but I believe that I am become better then I ever was. I don‚Äôt know who I am, and I would like to find out. I owe it to myself and my family to do so, because of the suffering I have caused everybody around me. I now believe in myself, I know each day is not necessarily better then the last but that‚Äôs alright for me now I‚Äôm just moving forward and hope to become the person who I needed when I was younger :)",2,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43295887}"

You know that feeling when you smoke and go play a video game, do something creative, or any other task and you zone in on it?

For example I play rocket league and when I get high Im so focused and play so fast and don‚Äôt get distracted by anything. I sort of unlock this level of creativity when I play high as well that I don‚Äôt have sober.

When I sit down to do work during the day (sober) I can‚Äôt seem produce any meaningful creative work. But as soon as it‚Äôs time for my nightly smoke and I casually sit down at my computer I can create all of these wonderful ideas.

I would like to quit smoking as I think I‚Äôm damaging my brain. I don‚Äôt remember anything, I lose my keys and wallet frequently, I feel ashamed all of the time, and paranoid that people have figured out how much weed i smoke and think I‚Äôm a loser for it (but just won‚Äôt say anything).

I've (23, m) always been anxious since I was a kid - but I'd say only slightly above the average amount of anxiety. Never anything I couldn't handle, it never stopped me from doing anything, and never any panic attacks. Pot has always seemed to worsen my anxiety, but the way it would make me feel creatively or when watching t.v made the tiny bit of underlying anxiety worth it. However, even though I ""love"" it, I have had some horrible psychological things happen to me when I smoke pot (tried to write out previous events -- too long and not that interesting -- to make it brief, let's say it made my anxiety manifest in physical ways that I had to see a bunch of doctor's about). But last night takes the cake.

I have been stressed lately. Beyond this global pandemic we're all currently struggling to get through, I have had some major family issues recently, and I'm supposed to move across the country at the end of 2021 with my best friend and she backed out the other day. So I feel very lost, and very stressed.

Last night I got super stoned, like every night. I was feeling fine - honestly vibing. I was making mac & cheese and listening to music. I finished making the mac & cheese and it looked funny, so I checked the expiration date -- expired. That's fine. Not good for my health anyway. So I started putting it down the trash disposal.

Suddenly, I get HORRIBLE anxiety. Anxiety like I've literally never felt it. Almost like I was in imminent danger. The walls felt like they were closing in and I started to get dizzy and sick. So I started saying to myself, ""It's okay that the mac & cheese is expired! There's nothing to worry about!"" Hahaha. So I put down the bowl and almost sit down at the kitchen table -- I wish I would have -- but instead I thought I better just try to make it to the couch and lay down.

So I walk down the hall and the dizziness starts to get INSANE. Like I'm insanely drunk. I keep smacking against the walls as I walk. So I start heading to the couch and suddenly everything gets SO crazy -- blurry and like everything is in slow motion.

I know I was aware in the moment, but honestly I can't really remember exactly which way I was facing or how I fell after the fact... but I came crashing down, right onto my coffee table (I must have hit the edge with my side though, because I woke up this morning with a stripe bruise across my side that hurts like hell). I've never fallen like that before. It was so fucking weird. I turn around and see my laptop and all my stuff is on the ground, and everything else from the table is scattered around the room. My first thought was, ""fuck - my laptop is definitely broken"" (it wasn't, btw). My second thought was ""What is poking my butt right now?"" It was a nail from one of the table's legs that literally BROKE IN HALF (it's wood).

Keep in mind I've never passed out (or came close - I'm still not sure if I passed out or just ALMOST passed out). So I was SO confused. I felt like I should call my parents, or an ambulance. And I decided to give it a few more minutes before I do that.

So I put my head in between my legs like I've seen on T.V and just sit there for a while. Not sure how long. Must have been five minutes or so. Long enough for me to think about what the scene would look like if my parents walked in and found me dead (because at this point, I seriously thought I might be dying).

Then all of a sudden I hear this loud sound that sounded like people were on both sides of my ears turning those rain-sound tubes up and down. So I start thinking ""Did I leave the stove on?"" So I force myself up and go to the kitchen. The noise doesn't get louder or softer, so I realize it's in my ears. I've NEVER heard anything like that.

So then I make my way to the bathroom and look in the mirror. You guys aren't going to believe this, but I've never gone pale before either. Let me tell you - it felt like I was looking at my dead body. I don't know if I'll ever get that image out of my head -- it honestly has been troubling me all day today (I know I'm being a bit dramatic, but... it was scary! I literally felt like I saw my own corpse -- I can't get the weird rings around my eyes out of my head!).

I start to feel sick and dizzy again, so I go back in the living room and lay on the couch. At this point I'm shaking and sweating and freezing. I start to think maybe I have the coronavirus. But my lungs and head both felt normal so I ruled that out. I google a few things and realize... oh my God, I think I had a panic attack! I start researching panic attacks more and realized that's definitely what it was.

So I start doing some breathing exercises I found online, which helped. Then I turned on the t.v, and, it was weird - I had to find something that wasn't anxiety inducing. And pretty much every show was making me panic. Tried watching The Hills (which I love) - couldn't handle it. Tried watching Real Housewives (which I love) - DEFINITELY couldn't handle it. Tried watching Alone Together - couldn't handle it. So I put on some game shows, which honestly made me feel comforted. I started trying to focus on every word they were saying, otherwise I would get sidetracked thinking about what had just happened. I also started doing like an upside down bicycle movement with my legs just to get my body engaged (even though I wanted to puke) and honestly that helped the most. Maybe because I was focusing on it? And I had to just keep reminding myself that I would feel better when I came down from my high.

It took me about an hour and a half to calm down and feel steady enough to get up and make my way upstairs to my bed. I was so glad when I did - I was fucking exhausted (it was 2:30 am at this point).

I decided as I was laying in bed that I was done with weed. OBVIOUSLY it doesn't agree with me, and I've been ignoring that for too long just to enjoy the weird benefit of being ""more captured with television"" lol. And this is only one way it has negatively affected me - there's been many other ways. I've tried to quit many times and literally couldn't. I'm hoping that this scary experience will be enough for me to stop (I didn't smoke tonight which is a HUGE accomplishment).

But yeah. Today I can laugh about it and move on. I told my parents all about it and they were very supportive and helpful. They wished I would have called them but I'm glad I didn't because I never want my Mom to see me like that, honestly.

Anyway, I've been quarantining for my family so I don't have a ton of friends I'm actively talking to right now, so I feel like I have no one to tell all these details to, so I wanted to just share on here so I could get it out of my system and process it. It was scary and it has consumed a lot of my mental energy today and I feel like just writing it out was very helpful. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this - I know it was long. For those who want the short version...

**TL;DR**: I had a marijuana induced panic attack and passed out - landing on my coffee table and breaking it in half.

2021-01-03 23:48:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kq1is6/day_1_again/,Day 1 ‚Äî Again,"I have struggled with a minor form of bipolar disorder since adolescence, and despite weed‚Äôs drawbacks, it was a convenient way to level out my manic and depressive episodes (which can last from a few days to a few weeks), while also having some fun along the way. Being in a creative field also validated my habit, since weed ‚Äúhelps creativity‚Äù‚Äîas the old wives‚Äô tale goes.

I‚Äôve been smoking daily for five years, and after just graduating with a master‚Äôs degree this past May 2020, I naturally fell way deeper into the weed habit to cover up the grief and loss for what was supposed to be the grand beginning of my career. COVID doused my ambition with a cold dose of cancelled gigs and festivals. However, I also began to delve further into Buddhist practice and began meditating as consistently as I could manage with my unpredictable manic/depressive swings. 

I quit once this past October, after I had gotten so rage-filled over a tiny inconvenience at work that I became violent at home (nobody was around, thank goodness). It was this moment that revealed to me HOW DANGEROUS weed can actually be. It revealed that it DIDNT level out my mood swings, but instead suppressed my emotions enough to keep me going‚Äîonly for those emotions to come back with a vengeance when I was sober.

I was sober for a month before I was forced to self-quarantine because of COVID exposure. Having roommates who work and study, I self quarantined completely in case I hadn‚Äôt infected them yet (though I never got the virus). During this time I relapsed heavily out of shame, anxiety, and for the ease of passing the time. Could I have used this alone time to try to become the Buddhist I‚Äôve always admired? Potentially. Did I feel ready to take that leap? No. So, I had a friend get me some weed, had a hazy two weeks, and fell back into my habit until the new year. My anxiety and shame have governed me through the weed I‚Äôve been consuming, and I‚Äôm not playing this game anymore.

Today, I threw out my stash again, and this time feels different. I‚Äôm quitting this time because I know, deep down, that I will find peace and success once the world resumes‚Äîbut weed is the ONE thing that keeps me from caring enough to make it happen. I‚Äôve been given an opportunity to get sober while the music world is on pause, and I intend to take it. I have a great day-job, a good support system, and fabulous mentors, and I don‚Äôt want to forget another damn thing that I‚Äôve learned/will learn from my life. 

I‚Äôm lucky to be able to live with my mental condition at a high functioning level, but I still fear my BP at its worst. That being said, I refuse to let weed turn that fear into a barrier to developing my own peace, love, and success‚Äîeven during the pandemic.

Thanks for reading :) I can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds. And thank you to everyone who posts here. Your life stories have kept my mind focused on quitting weed even at my most blissed-out stoned moments. Wouldn‚Äôt be doing this without the multitude of similar paths we all take on this journey to clarity.",6,"{'covid': 2, 'quarantine': 2, 'infect': 1, 'virus': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49160144}"

This made me go crazy and i felt like i was losing it. I never thought i would be my sane self again. Well, i was wrong. The first week after the 6th day was the worst week of my life. I have never been so mentally fucked ever before. Still have a bit of derealization but its moderate.

Fast forward to day 19, i feel much better now. I don‚Äôt feel crazy anymore and my normal self is starting to come back. However, i‚Äôm still depressed.

Everything is extremely boring to me. I barely find pleasure out of anything (it has improved though). I still cant sleep good also. My apetite has gone up like crazy. I want to eat all the time. 

I know im getting better by each day, but life kinda sucks right now. I had zero cravings to smoke when i was feeling really bad, but they are slightly starting to come back. They are easy to control though.

For anyone struggling in this journey, don‚Äôt give up. Do you really want to look back on your life when you take your last breaths and think to yourself that you wasted it all being stoned? You didn‚Äôt spend time with your family because you were STONED. You didn‚Äôt achieve that career because you were STONED. You didn‚Äôt meet that girl/boy that was the love of your life because you were STONED. Do you want this to be you? If not, use this as motivation to fucking STOP. If you feel like weed is not hindering you in life, then go at it, but if you know that it is, you can make a choice, and let fear be a motivation.

So I'm basically still suffering the same thing what got me quit smoking. I'm not excited about anything. I went to gym 2-4 times a week, but they did close them about a month ago, and I haven't been able to motivate myself doing home exercises. I'm basically sitting in a dark living room browsing my phone. I mean I do something sometimes, see my friends and stuff, but still.

The past month has been hard due to lock downs and my almost total isolation. I feel so alone. 

On new years I decided to take some thc oil. The oil is 30mg/g. I must have ingested atleast 120mg of it, if not more. I don't know why I took so much. I just kept taking it, and taking it again, more. 

I wish I could explain the experience I had once the thc kicked in. The first thing I remember is bursting out of bed in shock. My watch told me my heart rate was at 150bpm. I was hallucinating, hearing music that wasn't there. I wish I could describe it more but I can't. I used to suffer from night terrors as a kid, and this experience I had brought back similar energies to that. Just, absolute, pure, anxiety and terror. I felt like I was going to die, or was already dead. I literally accepted my own death and it terrified me. The high lasted about 24 hours+. I still feel out of it right now. 

I don't feel normal. And I am terrified this experience changed something about my psychologically that can never be undone. Am i psychotic? Am I normal? Am I crazy? Is it normal to feel crazy?

Before  i begin telling my story i just want to say that english is not my  mother tongue so i apologize in advance for grammatical and spelling  errors.

I was a long time lurker  here just reading through the stories everyone shared about their  relationship with weed. As i began reading through the different  experiences various people had with the plant, i started to realise that  i was not alone in feeling depressed, anxious and to an extent empty  inside. It all started 8 years ago when i smoked for the first time. At  the time it felt good and i could not wait to have another smoke session  with my friends because the feeling that erupted afterwards, was one of  pure joy and a small amount of euphoria.

During  the same time i started smoking, i also started my engineering studies.  Slowly but steadily my mental state of mind and health started to  deteriate and i could not function properly. My grades took a nosedive  and all i did everyday after school was to roll up and smoke until it  was time for bed. I smoked weed every single day from the day i started  to the day i decided to quit for good. I could blame all of this on my  young age at the time but the truth of the matter is that i lacked  self-control and discipline and smoking weed just made it worse for me.

The  low point of my mental well being came around december 2019. I was so  depressed i slept 12 hours everyday and i did not want to get out of bed  to even start my day. I ate food maybe once per day and if i was  feeling it that particular day, i managed to eat two times a day. My  anxiety was through the roof and i could not function socially around  other people if i did not have THC in my system.

In June 2020 I had an  interview for a thesis project that i managed to land and i was  schedueled to begin my thesis August 18th 2020. I promised myself that  if i get this opportunity i will not smoke weed during the time i work  on my thesis. At first i felt like shit when i quit, my symptoms were:

* Lack of sleep
* Loss of appetite
* Overall bad mood

My  appetite came back maybe two weeks after i quit, i still have have  problems sleeping from time to time but overall my quality of sleep is  much better then what it used to be. My mood shifts day by day but i  have alot more good days then bad days.

During this 140 day THC free run i've had i started and maintained:

* excerciseing, specifically running
* Wim hof method (Cold showers, breathwork, meditation) 
* Yoga/stretching routine
* Doing my thesis project that i have almost finished

I'm gonna wrap up this post now by saying that if you have thoughts about  quitting weed or you are already maybe in a streak of your own, be  relentless and keep working on YOU! NEVER EVER GIVE UP ON YOUR PURSUIT  OF A HAPPY LIFE AND A HAPPY STATE OF MIND!! Take one day at a time,  you're allowed to feel like shit from time to time and during your  streak its going to happen. START INCORPORATING GOOD AND LASTING HABITS  FOR YOURSELF I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH IT WILL BE A GAME CHANGER.  Don't be to hard on yourself if you fall of the wagon, if you fail you  don't begin at square one again, see it as a small setback and just keep  going and eventually you will fail less and less if you start to  replace the weed with other good habits.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60301036}"

I smoked more or less every day, every other day at a minimum, for the past 17 years. Marijuana stole more from me than I ever imagined it could. For the past 5 years or so I tried and failed miserably to moderate my usage and form a healthy relationship with the drug. Moderation was folly and I see that now, and with that realization comes new opportunity. 

Unfortunately I have to be honest with you that this isn‚Äôt my first time reaching this point. My longest ‚Äúsobriety streak‚Äù was 6 weeks back in early February. Then the pandemic swung into full force, and at the same time I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. I spiraled into a deep depression, and in true stoner form, let the haze swallow my feelings instead of processing them (valuable lesson learned). In November I found myself in a very dark place and finally decided that as terrifying as a sober life seemed, it had to be better than the life I was living at that time.

Well, I was right. My first fully sober day was December 2nd. The withdrawal symptoms were bad, but not as bad as the first time around back in February, which was pure hell. I have been keeping track of my mood/anxiety in a journal and here is a short summary:

**Week 1:** Hellish insomnia, went to the hospital TWICE for full-blown panic attacks. Horrible depression and anhedonia as feelings of the break-up resurfaced. General hopelessness. Why didn‚Äôt I cave? Because I knew what that road led back to. More darkness. Why would I want that?

**Week 2-3:** Mood 90% improved however I felt I was pink-clouding it and knew the elation of sobriety would eventually wear off. Anxiety 70% reduced, mostly just bad in the mornings, bad wave here and there every few days. My last panic attack was on Day 10. Insomnia 90% improved.

**Week 4-5:** Leaving the pink cloud and working on coping mechanisms. Finding alternate stress-relief. Rediscovering old hobbies. Learning to meditate, process my emotions, live with the lows so I can eventually truly experience the highs outside of a numb haze. Mood is stable. Anxiety 90% reduced. Sleep is normal outside of vivid dreams which I believe will settle down. Motivation to work on myself and improve my life is returning.

Don‚Äôt let me give you the wrong idea, I‚Äôm not some guru who‚Äôs sitting here telling you I‚Äôve found the answer, because there is no answer, there is no shortcut, no tricks; there is just life. I‚Äôm not out of the woods and I never will be, but I‚Äôm learning to enjoy the beauty of the forest. There will always be a voice inside of me that will whisper ‚Äúwhy not just once for your birthday?‚Äù But I know where that road leads, and I have let go of my delusions about learning to moderate.

I am only at one month and my experience is my own, so I can‚Äôt promise you everything will be fine and you‚Äôll emerge stable, calm and focused. *You probably will*, but I can‚Äôt sit here and promise that. This shit is hard. Sobriety is not a simple fix. Sobriety lets you work on yourself with intent, with a clear mind and a clear heart. ‚ÄúOne day at a time‚Äù, as us addicts often say, first sounds like an empty platitude but it‚Äôs the only way forward. Forget about the future because the future is overwhelming and terrifying. Just don‚Äôt smoke today, in this moment. And then repeat the next day, and the next, and so on until the repetition becomes habit.

My final message is it‚Äôs ultimately up to you. You have to WANT IT. You have to WANT a better life for yourself, and if you truly want it, the only thing that remains is figuring out a plan for what you are going to do to get what you want. I WILL be back to post another evaluation at the 2-month mark. Good luck leavers, stay strong.",19,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5913089}"

Been smoking for 5 years now, I have quit twice for durations of 5 months and 4 months and have relapsed both times after coming under particular times of stress. Now 3 days clean again... and the insomnia is killing me.

I have suffered from depression for just over 5 years due to an abusive childhood and the implications caused by these traumatic events. I have no family besides 2 brothers and a sister, No mum, dad, grandparents, cousins aunties or uncles thanks to my parents destroying ties and dragging me along. Until I seen them for who they were and cut my mother and father out of my life 2 years ago. 

I have been seeing a private therapist for 4-5 months now to help but its a journey im on to retrain how my brain thinks.

I literally credit Weed for saving my life on 4 or 5 occasions where I have been ready to take my life, and the only thing that stopped me was smoking a joint. This is the single most reason I find it so difficult to quit, How do you cut ties with your saviour?

I have a great career, partner of 7 years and on paper I have most of what many could ask for but none of this cures depression.

My reasons for wishing to quit are many, Number 1 being my children. I have a 5 year old and a 3 month old boys. My world. I have never ever smoked infront of them infact I have taken extraordinary measures for years such as, after every smoke (in the garage) i would come in and go to deoderant myself down, wash my hands, and mouthwash. My biggest fear is my eldest maybe smelling or realising what that smell might be.

Number 2 is the financial side, in my eyes I am stealing the opportunity to better my family and stealing my children's inheritance. I usually spend ¬£130 a week on this habit.

Number 3 is motivation. Im passionate about bettering myself and am currently also studying a HNC while working full time.

I dont exactly know what I intend to gain from this post, perhaps to encourage communication with like minded people or people in similar situations. I have no friends with experience with weed so I have no opportunity to discuss this topic with anyone.

For this reason, I suggest (and I've seen this suggested by lots of people on here) listing your reasons for giving up. Literally write them down!

 As soon as I realised WHY I wanted to give up, the temptation to revert has been obliterated. 

Aside from the internal stuff, physical and mental exercise, a good diet have helped ENORMOUSLY. Green Tea is my drug of choice now. Find something you enjoy doing, and do it. Im lucky enough to enjoy drumming. I've built a weather monitoring station using a raspberry pi (its a mini computer named as such, not an actual pie). Im now looking to get into astrophotography. Think these are things I would have explored when blazing 6 joints a day?

It hasn't been easy, certainly the first 4 weeks were an extreme challenge. But after that initial hump, its been a fun challenge most of the time. Covid has made it especially hard but most of us are in the same boat there.

At 16 years old, my girlfriend cheated on me. I loved her so much. That same night I smoked for the first time. This one choice changed my life. I smoked up until 2016 when I got pulled over on NYs eve. I had 20 grams, a gram of wax, a rig, and a blowtorch in my car. I was arrested and put on probation for a year. I was sober for a year and actually had a great year. The second my PO officer said I was off, I left class and went a hit a bong I had bought during probation. From then I just got sucked right back into it.

I am now 25 and just moved back with my parents to kick this addiction. Before I moved back with them, I lived alone in a 1 bedroom apartment, smoking everyday. As soon as I ‚Äúthought‚Äù i was done with work, (12pm) I would get high AF. Then I would get work calls or incoming sales leads, and just blow it cause I suck when I‚Äôm high. My friends can smoke, be good conversationalist, and live life fine high. I couldn‚Äôt. I become awkward and lazy af. Not answering calls, not feeling good, just being a POS all day. And I couldn‚Äôt stop. There was no moderation.

I have been single since the day I smoked for the first time. I have not even been close to being in a relationship. Everyone gives me shit for being single. My parents even thought I might be gay. (Which they would support) I am not gay though. I was just being a POS and had no motivation or confidence to get a GF. I have told myself I like being single, but I don‚Äôt. Nobody loves me unconditionally except my mom and dad. It hurts. I am so blessed to have my parents. When I moved home with them I told them what is going on and that I would be going through withdrawals and may be a dickhead. They were very respectful and have been giving me space. They are great parents and very supportive.

I want to live a better life. One with more love and happiness. I‚Äôm on day 3 being sober. If I did not self reflect on the negatives that weed has caused me, I would have relapsed for sure. Realizing that I have wasted my life away for 9 years hits so much harder than these withdrawals. My temperature has been going crazy. 97.2-99.4. I wake up dripping sweat and freezing, then I wake up hot af sweating. I am about to fall asleep sober for the 3rd day in 3+ years. (1 year off or it would be 9+)

Wish me luck, I know that life will get better and that I don‚Äôt have to go through life high all the time. The last thing I want is to wake up one day in my 60s and realize I am alone because I smoked weed everyday and did not realize my full potential.

I first want to express gratitude for this community (leaves). I was introduced to it whilee back but my mindset was different. Anyways, here I am and really impressed and feel supported so thank you and that is the end of that now let's get to my personal story sharing. 

I have been smoking daily since 2011 and have only taken a handful of breaks in between for short periods. I am well aware of my dependence. I recognize why cannabis is my preferred pillow (poison) of choice and how my childhood and adolescence experiences sprouted escapism with my reactions, hence the smoking ... as well as other areas of life but that's another story. 

Anyways, I work and will be starting school again tomorrow and I want tomorrow to be the first day I surrender and let go of my long-term relationship. It is a grieving process and I am scared. Awareness to my thoughts helps but that nagging ego likes problems so ... 
My stomach usually feels like I have butterflies in my stomach but they're drunk or something lol it doesnt feel settling. Does anyone else experience discomfort around their stomach area? I guess it's my solar plexus chakra off balance.. 

If you guys have any suggestions on relieving stomach discomfort  or the unsettling anxiety please let me know. I'm making myself scared and catastrophizing the situation.

- Sleeping better and feeling more well rested when I wake.
- Appetite is back in full force, can eat meals and snacks without worry of feeling nauseous.
- Better mental clarity, can communicate better with family/friends, memory is a lot less scattered.
- More motivated to do things (recently invested in some furnishings for my house, decided to move things around a little & make my rooms more serene/relaxing)
- Anxiety had reduced to more important worries, rather than being paranoid & getting worked up over trivial things.

However, there are a few lingering things that I am still working on through the continued withdrawal:

- Head tension is still prominent, as is the buzzing/ringing tinnitus although this seems to be waning slightly, only spiking every now and again. Mostly present during the day, in quiet rooms and when trying to sleep. 
- Dry mouth/dehydration also still an issue, but I'm doing all I can to make sure I've always got water/juice on standby.
- Hot/flashes, mostly my hands and feet get really cold and then my face will flare up
- Despite my anxiety lessening, I do have the odd day where my thoughts will be a little more intrusive and this in turn will make me irritable, and I find myself having short bouts of losing my temper at things during work or playing video games with friends.

For reference, I was an on/off smoker of joints for the last few years and it was strictly a social habit, until early 2020 when I found that a friend knew a dealer close by my new home, and that's when the chronic use came in. The UK lockdown didn't help either really, and I was furloughed for a good two months, so I was smoking morning through night daily right up until late November. To think that I was constantly worrying about running out and getting my next drop, seems so alien to me right now. Its an incredible feeling of internal achievement.

Just being in this sub, reading your stories, all the positive and helpful comments have helped me reach the longest non smoking period of my life. I'm 28 years old and I have been smoking weed daily since I've been 12 years old (I know it's young, sorry) so I've been a daily smoker for the bigger part of half my life. I tried quitting last year but after 2 weeks I started smoking during the weekends. This quickly turned into also smoking on Fridays, and within 2 months I was back in my daily routine. When I give myself a hand(some weed) I take the whole arm(back in the daily routine). I think I've learned that this time, and for now I have not relapsed yet, and yes it get easier. I did have a hard time during the holidays, but some helpful and kind words from fellow /leaves members have helped me get through it.

But the biggest boost I've gotten from this community is from a post from yesterday by the user Timetofacethemirror. His post is exactly how I feel about weed at the moment. I thought it did me good, I thought it made shows better, food better, sleep better. But instead it just made them all worse for me without realizing. Weed made me cancel my plans because at the time I smoked weed that was good enough for me, sitting on the couch seemed better then going to that appointment with that friend. Weed made me lazy and made me ok with how life was. Now I'm sober I've found my drive, I want to do more, I feel bored if I sit still the whole day, I want to work again.

2021-01-03 14:49:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kprifa/advice_for_new_years_leavers/,Advice for New Years leavers,"Hello Leavers, I've been seeing all the posts from new folks who are coming in hoping for a clean 2021 and thought I would offer some friendly and supportive advice. I got clean right around Christmas 2019 after 15+ years of use--I picked a heck of a year to get sober, I know, but this is what I found that worked for me.

&#x200B;

* **Ignore advice that doesn't work for you--there's no one way to do this.** That starts with my list! I'm just sharing my experience, you will find your own way through. Advice can be helpful to give you ideas but don't beat yourself up if an approach isn't working.  

* **That's right--don't beat yourself up.** Shame is not your friend in the quitting process, so when you find yourself engaging in negative self-talk (""why can't I do this? I suck!"" etc.) try out different ways to shift your mindset. For me, I have a couple little kids who I love more than anything. I imagine how I would want them to feel about themselves if they were in my shoes and struggling with addiction. Would I want them to hate themselves and beat up on themselves in their inner monologue? No way, I love those little guys! Then I try to talk to myself the way I hope they will talk to themselves, with love and compassion.  

* **Find outlets to tell your story so that you can discover assumptions you had about using that you didn't know about.** Being really honest here on r/leaves and telling your story is a great start. Read threads and make comments until you feel ready, then take the plunge and tell us what you've been through with this drug. Believe me, no matter how bad you think it's been, someone here has been through the same thing. Probably a lot of us. This is a safe space to tell the truth. And if you can also get into therapy, that's a very good thing to do too.   

* **Understand what's happening in your brain as you go through withdrawal and post-withdrawal.** It's easy to think that the acute physical symptoms like headaches and nausea, and the long term symptoms like anhedonia and difficulty regulating emotions, will last forever. The truth of the matter is just that THC is a substance that takes longer than many others to work its way out of your system, and the effect it has on your emotional regulation and cognitive function also takes time reset. If you are the brainy type, Judith Grisel's book *Never Enough* and specifically the chapter on weed was very, very helpful for me in understanding my symptoms. Through understanding I was able to have hope that all of the symptoms would subside. And they did! It just takes time, as in many months.  

* **Adopt new habits to ride out cravings.** When you feel an acute craving to use, sit down with a timer and just watch the time go by. After a while the craving will fade. Stop the timer. Now you know how much time you need to be able to get through to ride out a craving without using. Is it 2 minutes? 15 minutes? It's probably in that range. You might get this feeling 10 times a day or a hundred. But now that you know how long it will be with you, you also know that it will fade after that amount of time. So what new habit can you try to get you through that amount of time? Can you do pushups? Can you close your eyes and focus on your breathing? Can you put on music and loudly sing along? Try different things that fit into the window of time that you can pull out on short notice and come up with a list of options that works for you. Then look at your list when a craving hits and pick something to do. Over time, the cravings will come less and less frequently for shorter and shorter amounts of time.  


There's so much good advice here and I'm sure folks will respond with their own tips. In my experience, when you take care of your sense of self worth, your ability to talk about your experience, your understanding of what is happening, and your physical sensations of cravings -- that's when you can get control of this difficult habit. You can do it!",75,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.43950537}"

I also assumed it was part of withdrawal symptoms because it would often go away when I was high. Has anyone else had problems with sweating this far into quitting??

I'm starting to wonder if my sweating problems are unrelated to weed and if it might be cause I'm also addicted to nicotine (gross I know that's the next one to kick), or if I'm just a sweaty person in general and should seek help from a dermatologist. It has been a huge knock to my self confidence and I know I will feel so much more free if I am able to resolve this somehow.

The other factor that might play into it is that I took Accutane to get rid of my acne and finished around the same time that I started to become a stoner.

If anyone else has had problems with the sweats and has any advice on what I should do moving forward it would be greatly appreciated!

So I quit smoking a month ago, just cold turkey. It wasn‚Äôt my first time quitting but it was my first time quitting for good. Prior to that, I had been smoking daily for almost 8 years and was going through 1-2gs a day. 

I haven‚Äôt had any withdrawal issues so far expect cravings, but not strong enough to threaten my sobriety. 

Quitting weed was just my first step in a long journey of self improvement. I am 27 years old and have lived a decent life, but not my best life. I want to be a better, healthier, and more social person. I suffer from anxiety and I am 100% sure I am depressed. Weed was a nice escape from all of that but I am ready to take it all head on.

My question for those of you that have gone through a similar path, how do you stay motivated even when you hit roadblocks? How do I stop myself from fantasizing the worse of every situation? I fear rejection a lot and I feel like that fear of rejection manifests itself into reality at every chance it gets

How can I replace all this negativity in my mind with positivity? If my negativity  manifests itself, then my positivity should too, right? 

How do I deal with my sudden want to change but my impatience to wait for the results? Weed has made my brain addicted to instant gratification. How do I fight this?

I have never been a very frequent smoker, but a regular one nonetheless. I'd smoke once or sometimes twice a week and about 2-3 joints per session. I only ever got high with friends and never alone, because that's something i decided i'd never do with any substance. I felt like that was keeping me in check and it wasn't all that serious. 

I quit smoking, but i have yet to throw away or sell my hasj. After i quit i experienced no real craving for weed, but i would catch myself thinking about it regularly. After a few days or maybe a week i started dreaming very vividly, which i knew was part of quitting. This went by and i thought i did it, but on day 28 i woke up with an uneasy stomach. 

I thought nothing of it at first and went to a friend that night to celebrate the new year. I kept having cramps and ripping ass with nuclear smells during that night. I thought to myself this sucks, but it'll be over tomorrow. I'm now on day four of having heavy cramps and not really wanting to eat much. The first few days i thought i maybe had stomach flu, but i didn't  have any of the other symptoms associated with that. Today something in my brain clicked. 

I googled weed withdrawal symptoms and there it was: ""stomach and intestine problems"". It seems to get worse every day. It keeps me awake at night and unable to study for my midterms, which worries me. My stool looks like it has been slimed on the kids choice awards and my stomach cramps up every time i have to go. I read that the symptoms are usually over by the fourth week, but mine just started and i frankly do not have time for them. 

Did any of you guys experience such symptoms after a month still? Do you have any tips for dealing with them? I'd love to hear your tips or any thoughts on the matter.

I'm starting to feel ""normal"" or at least what's left of it after a few years smoking. I've realized a few things. When you're high 24/7 time flies by. when you're 24/7 for a few years moments in life just disappear almost like stuff didn't even happen. Or it takes a long time recall what happened litterally a year.

Although i think the worst realization of all is that weed suppressed me. It's a double entender since i'm doing better, getting my wit back and, **really** slowly coming out of my hermit cave. But it also brings out the bad in me. By that I mean the destructor mindset I had before going crazy with weed. I don't want to get too specific on what that means but you can probably come close. My tendencies are coming back, not to smoke weed tho no. But to do what I would do before I was an addict. It's not productive at all and I'm an adult now so it's definitely a no no now. I think I'm old enough to stop myself from being a dumb ass and going to jail. But i just find it interesting that's where the mind went. Back to that mindset and line of thinking as soon as the opportunity came up. I love it and it hate it. I spent the last few years being a pot head to suppress my other addiction. But now I guess I'm subconsciously in search of an other vice. I'm gripped by the knowledge in my skull and i could've had more but i spent time learning other things instead of smoking pot, masturbating, and using the computer for entertainment. 

TL;DR being sober has brought back a mindset i lost in highschool. Weed was my pacifier and I'm now raw dawgin reality like before. I don't dislike the mind set but i must learn to focus that energy to something productive and legal.

No matter how crappy I feel, at least I can smoke a bowl tonight and I can be excited for that. 

Weed doesn‚Äôt make you happy. It just temporarily makes the bad feelings go away. It feels comfortable. You can melt into the couch and just feel warm and fuzzy for a bit. But it‚Äôs not taking you anywhere. It doesn‚Äôt inspire you to better yourself, it tells you ‚Äúahhh, everything is ok now‚Äù, even when it‚Äôs not. 

Happiness comes from self-improvement and bettering yourself. It comes from setting goals for yourself and taking steps towards them. It comes from forging close relationships with people you care about and who care about you. It comes from being confident and loving who you are. It comes from recognizing your problems and worries and being willing to tackle them head on. It comes from new experiences and hobbies. It comes from feeling healthy. It comes from being satisfied with who you are and what your life is. 

It took me a long time to realize this but I feel better than I have in years and I‚Äôm only 11 days in. I don‚Äôt feel tired all day anymore, in fact I feel incredibly clearheaded and energized compared to how I felt before. I feel motivated and confident and an urge to be healthy and better myself. I don‚Äôt hate weed but I was finally able to be honest with myself about the consequences of abusing it. I feel like the old me again. Give it a chance guys, once the positive benefits of sobriety start to kick in, it becomes easier and easier to not want to go back. Feeling clearheaded and confident and motivated gives a better high than weed ever will. Numb comfort is not happiness.

2021-01-03 01:42:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kpfnki/my_thoughts_journey/,My Thoughts & Journey," I posted this on my personal facebook today:

As of today 1/2/2021 I am one month (31 days) clean of all THC. I make this post not as a virtuous brag but hopefully as encouragement and insight for others who may have considered it but are not fully committed to trying yet.

I feel context is important for this post as marijuana's public perception has slowly shifted through time from devils lettuce to something so nonchalant everyone and their grandma does it. Particularly among youth, as I was one of them, the perception that it causes no harm, is not addictive, and is a weak substance is a prevalent one to have.

I have been a regularly heavy user for roughly 8 years. Maintaining a constant buzz for those 8 years. Smoking before and after work, before and after every meal, before going out with friends or family, upon waking up and before bed always. Any time and chance I had I'd probably be taking at least a hit. At my highest point a friend and I were splitting a half ounce of hash every 2 weeks. That is at least a half gram of hash every day for 14 days. I think this context is important because it is insight into just how ingrained weed has been in my life.

For now I have kicked this habit entirely of my own volition and want. My reasons for quitting are many. It's been on my mind for the past 3 years and along the way there have been many key insights and observations made by myself, family, and friends. I've carried a lot of guilty thoughts with me through the time of my use. I frequently thought about my mental health, particularly memory. Having used throughout my brain's developmental period I often think, would I be smarter or better had I never used? Would I remember more of my childhood and all the things I've done in life with more clarity? There is no going back now and these sorts of things are impossible to quantify. It stands to reason though that constant heavy use especially through the developing period has had an impact for better or worse.

A stand out moment for me happened a few years ago as I was getting ready for work. It was early in the morning and I had just smoked. As I was waiting to leave my mom had just woken up for work herself. She smelled that I had just smoked and she said this to me:

""If you saw me standing in the kitchen early in the morning before I was going to work, and I was chugging a beer; just one, it wont get me drunk, it might not even get me buzzed. But what would you think or say about that?""

That moment and those words were very powerful for me as a perspective shifter. Ill never forget it.

If weed were alcohol I‚Äôd most certainly be classified an alcoholic.

This is a point to be made by this post. Not that substance is bad. Far from it. Humanity's history with substance is a very deep and complex one. I'd stand to argue that no one, not even the most asetic monks are free from substance use. We all get off on substance in one form or another be it God, Sex, Money, Power, Meditation, Music, Drugs, you name it. Very few things on this planet, taken out of context, are inherently bad, negative, or evil. It is our relationship with these things that defines the context in which they reside.

As society progresses and talks around substance use and mental/emotional health become more common it is my hope that more of us will consider our relationships to the substances we choose; the hows and whys behind them. Question your own motives for why you do what you do in all of life as this will surely help you live a more fulfilled and prosperous life.

 

The most asked questions I'm getting lately are, ‚Äúwell how do you feel, do you feel different?‚Äù.  
Am I more focused, more motivated or driven? Am I happier?

These questions are hard to answer and the ‚Äòfeelings‚Äô are hard to quantify. Being just a month in as a heavy user it's unlikely I‚Äôll notice any difference so soon. I'd say the only difference so far is perhaps my perceived baseline anxiety level has shifted slightly?

Speaking to drive and motivation, I recognize that substances can have negative impacts on drive and motivation but personally I don't feel a sudden boost in my own drive and motivation for life and it's various tasks. Any drive or motivation issues I have would likely stem from deeper more complex issues such as psychology and the balance of various chemicals in the brain.

Speaking to happiness; I'd say that I never specifically used it as a coping tool to feel happier or as an ‚Äòescape from reality‚Äô. More often than not I‚Äôd actually feel worse after smoking, filling myself with thoughts of guilt and anxiety, ‚Äúdamn why am i doing this again!‚Äù My reason or more so lack of, has actually been total mindless habitual use.

There are plenty of reasons one chooses to use substance/s but i'd argue that there doesn't even really need to be a reason to use a substance. I'd say substance use is a primal desire and urge held by all of us. Whatever it is we are getting off on most likely makes our brains feel good. It's fun. It feels good. I'd say that's more than enough reason to do anything.

But again this all comes back to the relationship aspect of all things in life. What is your relationship to that which you are doing? Is it totally mindless? Does it cause you harm or guilt or grief? If so I implore you to explore your relationship with said thing on a deeper level and find out what it is you gain or lose partaking in that thing.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.56579494}"

For context, I had been hooked on carts for a little over a year. I would be puffing everyday and go through a 1.1 gram cart in about 2 days or so. After a lot of introspection I decided my relationship with THC was toxic and decided it was time to quit... or so I planned. One day into sobriety and the withdrawal symptoms were bad enough that I needed to puff in order to ease them. That‚Äôs when I came across this sub where I got a lot of useful information and found inspiring stories daily. After doing some reading I began my break once again and I am currently 8 days in. 

Prior to my breakup with THC I was hesitant because I read that withdrawals will last weeks to months and it was very discouraging. But I believe that addressing the timeline of my symptoms could be encouraging for those who also are looking to quit.

Please keep in mind, I was very addicted and dependant on THC but only for a year. Many of the others in the community have gone through harsher withdraws from extended use. 

It is worth noting that all throughout the week I have been drinking TONS of water, getting lots of exercise in, and tried to establish calming night time routines. 

Some symptoms I have experienced all week: Loss of appetite, general irritability, mood swings.

Day 1: Slight nausea, anxiety, could not fall asleep for hours, once asleep - awake every couple hours with night sweats. 

Day 2: Very nauseous, chills and hot flashes, headache, chronic sweating and the same sleep issues.

Day 3: Moderately nauseous, chills, slight sweating, headache, however my night sweats began to reduce in quantity and my mood began to improve.

Day 4 : Nausea was more or less dissipated but a slight headache remained. Trouble falling asleep but limited night sweats.

Day 5: Nausea and headache are gone. Appetite is slowly coming back but still greatly reduced, mood is improving, Falling asleep still difficult but almost slept through the night without night sweats (1 wake up).

Day 6: Appetite is slowly recovering, falling asleep is becoming significantly easier as I establish routines, night sweats are gone.

Day 7: Appetite is generally still muted but sleep is nearly fully recovered. 

I am posting this to show that the withdrawals are what you make of them. I know my case wasn‚Äôt as severe as many but hopefully it can encourage others in a similar situation to take that first step.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5084169}"

I have about 10 days until another drug test. I knew about this a couple days ago though, so the past few days of ""trying"" to quit obviously weren't that successful. 

I've been having a lot of anxiety about it because, well, I could lose my job obviously. But also because weed is my main coping mechanism... I have pretty bad mental health issues at times, and weed numbed me to the point where the past two years made it bearable enough that I didn't have any significant episodes.

I have many Day 1s but never really make it passed the first day. The depression and anxiety get so bad when I quit. I know my emotions can't hurt me, but in the past it was never easy for me to cope with things and I have had times where I would self harm or go to the hospital with suicidal thoughts. I have the intense fear that my mental illness will get worse if and when I quit.

And worst of all I almost feel like just giving up because I'm scared that even if I did manage to quit right now and make it 10 days that the numbers still wouldn't reflect the progress I've made and I would lose my job anyway...

When my basil order arrive days late, I go into withdrawel, I can't sleep at night then break out into insane sweats, I have zero appetite, and this time, I went 4 days without solid food, I'm just managing to nibble on a little something, which is usually the sign I'm over the hump. This is excruciating for me as I get extremely emotional, so miserable at times, sometimes I'll get suicidal thoughts (don't have the balls to do it and couldn't do that to my mum) and have insane bursts of anger other times, and any pains I have in my back and neck intensify. 

I ripped my t-shirts off me on Weds after work, for no reason, rage just builds in me, then I broke down in tears because I'd ripped the t-shirts, not because I was sad that I destroyed some cool tees, but despite my usual bad temper, I hadn't fully lost my temper once in 2020, despite it being a shit show of a year, then on new year's eve, the very last day of the year this happens, I lost control of my emotions and destroyed my own possessions and I just felt like Id come so far just to fall on the last day of the year. 

At this stage I hadn't eaten or slept in almost 40 hours, while having done 2x 12 hour shifts at work during this time. 12hr shift, get home, no sleep, back in for another 12 hours. 

So the majority of the anger and physical symptoms have started to subside a little in the past hour. In another day or two I will be totally recovered once I get a few meals into me. 

I usually come out the other end with an increased passion for life, music sounds better, I smile and laugh more, I'm not self conscious, I feel great. 

The only thing is, my order of basil will eventually come, and I'll most likely end up smoking again. 

I've spent the last 32 hours in bed, getting up occasionally to smoke a cig, or walk to another area of the house and just lay there for 5 mins to break up the monotony of being in bed all day. 
I've recently found myself curling up in odd spots in the house, which ive never done before, it seems more like a depressive state, I usually feel depressed in these states but this one seems like its consuming me more, draining me more. 

I broke down in tears also talking to my Mum, which I never done before either. I told her that my relationship with my Dad is terrible and it's affected me terribly, the older I get the worse my emotional problems seem to get. 

My parents are still married and I still live at home, he's always hated me, going back to my earliest memories are him treating me like shit or hitting me, not abusive beatings but still defs too much for a small child, and his presence terrified me til I was around 19, properly terrified. He never says hello to me, barely acknowledges I exist, has never wished me a happy birthday in 31 years, I have 6 other siblings who have all moved out, and he talks and treats them normally and I just feel like an unwanted, adopted burden to him, despite he barely sees me or talks to me. It wouldn't be so bad but I've been in this situation for 31 years straight, my confidence is at an all time low as every day I'm in the situation, another day, week, year or rejection. I wait til he leaves the house to eat or make a coffee usually , I just hate being in his line of vision, if I Know he can see me I feel horrible and my skin crawls. 

So this shit with my dad has come to the surface more than ever during this period of withdrawel symptoms, and I think the reason I smoke is to keep the emotions around this surpressed. 

But I don't want to spend morning to night smoking anymore, I've become so badly unsocial, I've drifted away from all my friends, to the point they don't invite me to get togethers anymore, which is understandable, I never show up anyway.. Even a dinner or a night out with my best friends will have me so anxious I'll just not go. I'll arrange dates with women then just stop texting them once the accept. 

So now I'm over the withdrawel hump, I'll experience a new high for life for a few days, then I usually get bored with life soon after again and return to smoking. Or if life's going so well I'll have a smoke at night as a reward and eventually I'll be back smoking morning to night. 

I work 12hr shifts alone, then come home to my bedroom alone, I don't sit in the living room with my parents because my skin crawls when I'm in the presence of my father. So I spend every day alone, I live in the deep countryside so I don't even see people walking around outside.

So basically, I'm addicted, I'll go off it unwillingly due to the late postage, get over the withdrawels, feel great, then fall right back into it. Repeat. Repeat. 

I feel maybe just asking my father why he treats me so differently might be a good idea, but I just can't bring myself to do it, he's so closed off emotionally and so am I when dealing with him, and he's so old fashioned (Irish man in his 70's) that he'd struggle to even express himself if he wanted to I think. 

It's a massive deal to me and I don't think hell even fave the question head on. 

I just feel more lost than I ever have. I hate my job, I hate being lonely, Ive always spent alot of time alone but recently I feel its negative impacts on my mental health. I hate feeling like an unwanted burden when I come home, when I broke down to my mum she didn't even ask if I'd be OK or offer any sympathy or support, which really surprised me and has confused me cuz my mum is AWESOME. So after aid broken down I was checking through the window to see that I hadn't upset her. So I broke Down in tears, and she didn't ask if I'll be OK but yet I'm checking on her to see if she's OK incase my despair affected her. It hadn't. 

This is going nowhere I Know, I just need to vent. 
If anyone else has had problems with their emotions/ weed/ family issues tied in together it would be great to hear from you.

I've been an everyday smoker for around 15 years. I'm 37 now, first smoked when I was 16 but it really ramped up in my early 20s. I've had a few off periods during that time - a good six months when a girlfriend didn't approve of it and spun out when she found out I was secretly smoking. But as soon as we broke up, I was straight back on it.

I had another break around five years ago when my flatmate who I smoked a lot with decided to stop for a while. I lasted around 3 months, until a stoner friend visited from overseas and we smoked up. I did the whole, just this one time just for special occasions shit, but was back to every day smoking within a couple of weeks. 

I've realised that I'm definitely an all or nothing person. I had plans to give up last year, but obviously when the pandemic happened I was like uhhh fuck that, I'm gonna smoke. 

I'm nearly at the end of the ounce I bought before Christmas. I need to gather some will power to not buy anymore. I'm sick of never reading books, never remembering anything, waking up with brain fog etc etc. And since I got diagnosed as ADHD and prescribed ritalin, I'm quite liking the clear head it gives me - I have been smoking less since I started, which is something.

But yeah. Very poor impulse control. I'm hoping I might stand a better chance of quitting now because I have no stoner friends in town anymore, I just smoke alone.",7,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.55452883}"

I am an extremely passionate person and that gets numbed away when I smoke, I want to start getting more involved in the hobbies I have neglected and start to realize the vision I have for myself once I leave college

My future job does a lot of work for state/local government which I know I will be very interested in and will be able to get passionate about, and I know there's a high likelihood I will get drug tested for this. I won't be able to live with myself if I screw this opportunity up, so I won't

I know if I smoke even once it will ultimately lead to me smoking all day, I've tried to limit myself but that is just not within my capabilities. Addiction runs heavily in my family, and I am an addict as well. There is no escaping this fact for me

I am taking my life back from weed and that starts today. God damnit I'm gonna do it, I know it won't be easy but this is the time I quit for real, for good.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43793845}"

I used to be the overly-involved, super busy kid in high school. First year of university same thing. Then I started smoking in second year and I slowly stopped doing things like volunteering, meeting new people, joining clubs, going to prof office hours etc. My grades started slipping too. I got a decent job out of uni and got promoted quickly, but as I started smoking earlier and earlier each day it started affecting my work also. After a while I was just going through the motions at work and I stopped progressing as quickly.

The problem is, I was a perfectionist in high school and uni (not in a good way). I went through depression and anxiety and attempted suicide once. My worth was tied to my external ""resume"". Weed made me no longer care about that resume and less of a try-hard. In a way that was really good for me.

Now I'm using that as an excuse not to quit. I don't want to be that person so focused on motivation and productivity. I want to be more chill, almost like a stoner, but also not be ruled by weed.

I was more ""successful"" but wasn't happy when I was sober, but I'm also not happy now. So trying to find reasons to quit but scared to go back to who I was. 

I'm at the end of day 1 of quitting and it's hard. Are there any A type personalities out there (who have quit) that can relate to this? Is your motivation a ""healthy"" motivation or are you putting a lot of pressure on yourself to now keep hitting that next goal?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5548365}"

I thought weed allowed me to take the edge off after (or during) a long day. I thought weed let me connect and chill with friends. I thought weed made me cool. I thought weed was a miracle cure to the anxiety, sadness, and loneliness that I felt. 

Instead, weed made me doze off during a show. Weed made me eat until my stomach hurt, or worse, order delivery food and then fall asleep before it arrived. Weed made me stress about how much I had left in my stash, and when and how I would get more. Weed had me skipping obligations or ignoring emails at work, which left me more stressed. Weed had me draining my bank accounts. Weed kept me awkward and not truly present. Weed had me texting my dealer while I was at dinner with friends, eager to leave them so I could rush home in time to pick up before he was off for the night. Weed kept me disconnected and isolated. Weed kept me dependent on it to fall asleep, and then waking up groggy and unrested. In the end, the consequences of my weed use kept me anxious, sad, and lonely.

I quit smoking a couple weeks ago and made it my mission to not smoke in 2021 and hopefully stay away from it forever. even though I had a couple weeks clean already I decided to get together with my homie and have one last day of smoking before the new year. like expected I still wanted to quit but mostly just did it to start 2021 fresh and have one last session with the bro. I've tried to quit multiple times in the past without success beyond 2 weeks at the moet. but I'm at that point in my life where I don't need to smoke anymore and honestly just don't feel any desire to anymore. on new years eve we smoked a lot and just reminisced on the good times we had in high school smoking every day and doing other drugs on top of that eventually. the thing is I've always had control and the ability to say enough is enough because I genuinely care about my health and the risk of physical dependance on something isn't worth it to me. weed is the only drug I use every day and I've done some pretty addictive compounds in my run, even going on a few benders here and there and stopping no problem just because of the level of care I have for my own health and success in the future. weed is the only thing I can't use in moderation, it's either daily or not at all and I'm sure a lot of you can relate to that. this time I'm overly confident that I can leave this in my past and I've came to realize that the negative effects on me are just not worth the slight high I feel from it. after our new years eve smoke sesh I gave my homie all the rest of my pack and all smoking accessories and as of the new year I'm completely done with it. only other substance that had the same level of grip on me was nicotine and I've been clean for 7 months with pretty much 0 cravings or effort, I just didn't wanna do it anymore and now I feel the same about weed. it's been a good run and a learning experience, I don't regret smoking daily as long as I did and I wouldn't be the same person if I hadn't. over the past year I've evolved tremendously as a person and weed only holds me down these days when it used to be a good tool for me. I've learned how to face my problems on my own and I'm ready to leave the weed as simply a good time to look back on in my future. I've had my fun and now it's time for me to move on. big respects to everyone who's encouraged and uplifted me in the past, but I'm happy to say that I'm at a great point in my life where I don't crave weed at all anymore and have no problem not using it. my goal is no weed for 2021 and I honestly think it'll go far past that. I've became a totally different person over the past year especially and I'm ready to face my demons and focus on what really matters to me. anyone still facing addiction I feel for you, I've been in your shoes for 3 years now. stay focused on yourself and what you want out of life and I promise in due time you'll experience the same thing I'm experiencing right now. as for the time being, don't stress yourself out, quit at your own pace, and remember just because you failed doesn't mean you can't come back at it stronger and you will get stronger over time.  I believe all of you can overcome your inner demons and eventually will achieve everything you've ever dreamed of. you're strong and smart just for being on this subreddit and eventually the time will come when you're in the same boat as me, and I want that for every one of you. much love to the community for helping me become the person I am today and as always feel free to message me, I'm very non judgemental and open to discussion. much love and good luck to all of you in 2021. <3",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5047686}"

Smoking bits I found on the floor and stuff.... I like that it makes feeling good easy. *But I don't wanna mess with anything I can't feel good WITHOUT.* 

Today I've been craving it a lot (to solve my nausea) but I told my brother we shouldn't get any more and I told my mom too. I spend too much time thinking about the things I like to do high ... so here are some things I don't do when I'm high all the time:

* When I'm high I don't write in my journal
* I don't finish my artwork
* When I'm high I don't go running 3 times a week 
* When I'm high I don't remember the days passing (this can feel like a perk during quarantine but it's self destructive)
* When I'm high I don't pay enough attention to our puppy
* When I'm high I don't eat consistent meals
* When I'm high I don't go biking 
* When I'm high I don't clean my room
* When I'm high I don't watch movies with my brother (we always mean to but just end up zonking out)

2021-01-02 11:48:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/kp0qje/day_4/,Day 4!!,"Hi everyone,
 
Like a lot of you I use weed to relax and deal with life. I‚Äôm 18 now and I started smoking at 16 when a friend introduced it to me. My girlfriend at the time(who I dated until around 17) didn‚Äôt approve of weed so I hid my habit from her. I really only smoked every other weekend or so at this point. Everyone has their idea of ‚Äúthe good old days‚Äù when it comes to weed, and that was definitely this time for me. Me and my friends discovered it together and had borderline psychedelic experiences together. Overall this made us all very close in sharing these experiences.

Eventually my girlfriend broke up with me and immediately after I started buying my own weed. Before this I mooched off my one friend and used it very sparingly. Buying my own stuff was the beginning of the end. Since the day I bought my own stuff, the longest I‚Äôve been sober is 3 weeks. 

I definitely used it as a crutch in this time, smoking every night to ignore my feelings. I wasn‚Äôt sober a single night until quarantine began and I decided I should use the time to deal with my problems. I quit for 3 weeks, in which time I realized how many feelings I‚Äôd been suppressing. This time was very good for me and by the third week I felt on top of the world. Of course I decided that smoking every once in a while wouldn‚Äôt hurt, so I bought more stuff. The second I had stuff again I was back to my daily habit.

This continued all the way up to right before college. Quarantine made it so easy to excuse my habit, and admittedly it did help with my isolation and anxiety at the time. Because of my grandma I wasn‚Äôt allowed out at all even though all my friends continued to hang out as normal.

At one point I collapsed my lung(not related to smoking, I broke 3 ribs skating a rail and one of them punctured my outer lung) and the night I got home I smoked. I‚Äôm still so ashamed that I‚Äôm such an addict that I even convinced myself that smoking(well, technically dry herb vaporizing) wouldn‚Äôt hurt a FUCKING COLLAPSED LUNG. Eventually I came to my senses, when I started freaking out thinking my lung recollapsed while high(it didn‚Äôt, but I did feel a lot of pain). 

I took a month off smoking and had my weed at the time turned into edibles. I took huge doses of edibles every night, I would estimate 200 mg every night, sometimes more. I normally would just pass out after a couple hours, and the next day I would feel soooo shitty and exhausted. Nonetheless when 9:00 pm came around I would do the same fucking thing.

A month after this, I went to college. The entire time I was at college I had 1 sober night. Fucking 1. My grades were fine but could‚Äôve been better, but I know that weed made me lose considerable motivation. In this time at college, I had covid and mono, and I didn‚Äôt stop smoking for either. I vividly remember having lots of lung pain and still smoking like the addict I am. Eventually though, I did get better. I attribute this only to the fact that I‚Äôm an avid skateboarder and my lungs are in somewhat decent shape despite my smoking and sickness. 

The first week at school all I did was seek out people who smoked. I surrounded myself with enablers because anyone else bummed me out, and made me feel gross or guilty about my habit. One person who I would say is the closest friend I made at school, was particularly good about enabling me. I tried to take a break when I had mono and covid and he pressured me into smoking. I‚Äôm not gonna blame him entirely for this though, I am responsible for my own actions and I chose to smoke in this time.

I began smoking all day every day when I had the freedom to. College provided me with the ability to make my own decisions and I always made the wrong one, partially because I intentionally surrounded myself with enablers. 

Fast forward to 5 days ago, I got ankle surgery. I repeatedly got ankle sprains for two years leading up to this surgery, because my initial sprain resulted in a complete tear of two ligaments. I woke up from the surgery with a congested left lung, and nonetheless still smoked that night. The next day I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with post operative pneumonia and got put on a ton of antibiotics. I quit smoking that day, and have stuck to it for 4 days now.

I know it‚Äôs only been 4 days but I guess in a way it feels like this was a blessing. It‚Äôs so hard to see how weed effects your life from the inside of the addiction, because it truly convinces you that it is only a positive in your life. Yes, pneumonia has sucked ass, and coupled with weed withdrawals it has been even shittier, but every day I feel better and sleep a little easier.

I do have one question for you all. I haven‚Äôt formed many close friends who aren‚Äôt smokers, besides some of my skating friends. Actually, all of them smoke too, but our friendship is based on skateboarding rather than just smoking so it‚Äôs different. But anyways I am supposed to live with the aforementioned guy who I live in my dorm with, and he is a massive stoner. Over time I‚Äôve realized he‚Äôs kind of a loser(this sounds harsh, but I look at myself as just as much as a loser for my addiction) mainly because he has no hobbies or interests outside of weed. It‚Äôs all he talks about and it annoys the fuck out of me. I haven‚Äôt told him I‚Äôve quit yet and I know he‚Äôll raise hell because of the kind of person he is. What should I do? Part of me wants to ditch him but I would feel so guilty because he has had a lot of difficulty making friends at college, and he considers me his best friend(I don‚Äôt). I have to apply for an apartment ASAP so I don‚Äôt have too much time to think about this.


My dreams have been crazy(something I‚Äôve always enjoyed about quitting weed), and I have woken up sweaty every morning. I feel closer to my family because I feel like I have noting to hide or feel guilty about. 

I‚Äôm mostly posting this to get some feelings out and hold myself accountable. I‚Äôm really young and I know this won‚Äôt last forever, but I hope I can permanently change my relationship with cannabis. I don‚Äôt want to be a daily user. I want to feel healthy. I want to feel clearheaded and be able to have normal conversations with people. I want to save money, and not rely on a substance for my happiness.

If anyone read all or even any of this, thank you. It‚Äôs very messy but I just wanted to get my feelings in ink.",3,"{'quarantine': 2, 'covid': 2}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.475666}"

I quit drinking after years binge and black out drinking in my teens and college years, and now several years later I have zero desire for it. Maybe once a year I'll have an irish coffee at brunch, and it feels incredible! I quit cigarettes, went back twice, and quit twice more. Now  a year or two in from my last 'relapse', I can watch others smoke and have zero desire for it.

But I could never manage to lay off the weed for more than a week. I started an SSRI at the absolute lowest dose and it changed my life -- gone were the GI issues, constant full body anxiety that would wake me up in the mornings with my heart racing. It has given me an entire world of engagement and clear thinking I could never have dreamt of.

The last six months I have focused on trying to get pregnant, to no avail. I would promise myself again and again ""I'll quit a month before I start trying"", which would turn into ""I'll quit for the two week wait"", which would turn into ""I'll quit when I get a positive pregnancy test"". Well, that day never came. I would find any article I could denying the late implantation and other negative impacts weed has on trying to conceive, even though I *knew* it couldn't possibly be helping me. I gained 30 lbs in the pandemic and fell into the hole of getting high all day, every day just to cope with the boredom and stress of lockdown with little to occupy myself all day.

Yesterday was my birthday - I had been planning many months ago to celebrate with sobriety, from Jan 1 onward. So what was the first thing I did when I woke up in 2021?Take out cash and pick up... Ate 400mg of edibles and just coasted through my 26th birthday........ Good god, I am so done with this. I've shared my story/reasons on here before, but basically have been addicted to weed (primarily shady vape pens) for the last 8 years now! Not just binging during weekends or evenings -- Every single day. From sun up to sun down. Have lost plenty of friends, thousands of dollars, relationships with my immediate family... Plus I'm very aware that it's trying to fill a void inside me that will never be satisfied. So I call it addiction.

I've made a couple attempts to stop before, and just turned 26, but for whatever reason I feel I'm afraid to ""fully"" stop. If I can just manage to get the behavior under control, it would be fine right? Why can't I just smoke on Saturdays? How come everyone else has it under control except for me? My parents are big drinkers, maybe there's something there.... 

But my habits have evolved to such a dangerous intensity, the choice has been provided for me: It's all or nothing now. I have the awareness that I'm currently powerless over this drug, it's more than a crutch. And it's  always been a secret practice too! I always hide away and nobody knows just how much I've spent or how I'm perma-stoned (maybe my parents do but they just don't tell me, our relationship is fraught). I genuinely feel like I've been avoiding this life, out of fear and shame.

Sorry, long story! ANYWAY, just wanted to connect with other folks on their first few days. Let's **please** keep each other posted, this place is an invaluable resource. My real goal is to learn how to be accountable to MYSELF. Staying consistent, not backing down in the face of anxiety or stress, actually dealing with issues in the moment, including cravings! I'm grateful I took some baby steps last year (though I wish I made more progress), particularly finding this sub. I might post here every day, if that's ok... I bought a journal too, I'm feeling pretty damn tired of being silent, invisible, and ashamed.

I ran through all of the familiar excuses yesterday, and of course today nothing rings true. No more BS. We know what's right. It will be very hard, but it's entirely possible. And it is a GOOD THING. It's what everyone whats for us, hell isn't it what we actually want: To actually feel better?

I'm in my mid 30s now, been smoking since 2010 proper and boredom is my problem, weed fixes that. If I'm bored I feel utterly shit and it scares me. I can fix with with either weed or booze (or it would have been harder stuff back in the day)

Boredom caused my mother to become an alcoholic and eventually killed her when I was 9 yesrs old, nearly killed my dad too but he's been off booze for 25 fucking years now, he's a legend.

Last night I ran out and didn't refill. I know I can go without weed, I did 4 month between May and Sept last year because of a relationship breakup (had been together 7 years, properly fucked me up) but I turned to booze, put on 3 damn stone and felt even worse.

So now, I'm going T total for at least Jan. See how I feel in Feb but not this month. 

On a side note, if people are struggling with weight gain after quitting weed, CICO (calories in, calories out) is the key.

I've done no exercise other than walking and I've dropped a stone and a bit in two months by staying under 1500 a day, got another 2 to go!

Sorry people, I just needed to tell someone. Green is still very illegal over here (UK) so it's not like I have many people to talk to about it.

In 2019-2020 I spent about 8 months high every night. I was a ‚Äúproductive stoner‚Äù and it wasn‚Äôt until I found this sub that it really started to dawn on me that I wasn‚Äôt progressing in life.

I decided to quit smoking. As anyone who‚Äôs tried can attest to, the first week was so damn difficult. For me, the second week I started feeling amazing. My stomach no longer hurt, I was less clumsy, could feel my emotions more.

By the third week I felt pure euphoria. I was so proud of myself for quitting, what felt like pretty easily. I was working out every day, eating proper, and starting to look good. My short term memory kicked back into action and I started getting vivid flashbacks of all the best moments of my life.

The absolute best part of these 3 weeks were my dreams. I know lots of people struggle with horrible nightmares, but I‚Äôm very lucky in that my dreams were mostly amazing. Flying across the world, meeting super interesting people, experiencing feelings I can‚Äôt possible experience while awake. I couldn‚Äôt WAIT to fall asleep every night.

By the end of the fourth week however, I hit a peak. Life felt... normal again. It felt boring. I wasn‚Äôt as motivated to keep working on self improvement.My adventurous dreams calmed down. I found myself feeling distanced from my friends who could enjoy the pleasantries of smoking without getting addicted. I felt left out. I started getting depressed reading about people who quit smoking for years then relapsed, realizing I would have to fight urges to toke up for the rest of my life

I decided to just smoke one joint... of course, that didn‚Äôt go to plan. I was able to pace myself at first, only smoking once a week, but quickly picked up the habit of daily bong rips once more.

This time I smoked daily for about 3 weeks before deciding to quit again. I had completely lost track of time and didn‚Äôt realize that much time had elapsed. I smoked way more daily than I had before.

This made quitting once again, even harder the first week. In contrast, however, I felt even better during the second and third week than I had the first time I quit.

We just hit a new year and for the last 6 months, I‚Äôve spent alternating months either stoned of of my mind every night, or sober, feeling engoulfed in euphoria.

I just feel... weird. And it felt good to type this out. Can anyone relate?

By the way I don‚Äôt feel like I wrote this post very well cause it‚Äôs day 1 of my 6th time quitting and my brain is foggy as hell.

We all began smoking together (slowly) as a way to cope with everything we went through (my father is abusive alcoholic workaholic never home but still ruins everything kind of guy). Although I‚Äôve always seen the downsides of smoking, watching my sisters‚Äô lives deteriorate slowly over years and years has shown me that I must end this addiction.

It's been a while since I've posted now. I was going through some really bad anxiety that I didn't think would ever subside. But to my surprise, I'm coming out of the fog now. I'm trying not to get too excited in case I slip back into it. But it feels different now. 

I'm able to enjoy most things again, music, tv shows, movies, video games are a huge help for distraction. I'm finding as long as I don't focus on the fog and the anxiety, it goes away a bit more. I'm still experiencing visual issues and problems driving, but I think I need glasses lol. That only started once I quit smoking. 

This has not been an easy road, by any means, and I really learned that I've withheld alot of my emotions since numbing myself with pot. I have not cried this much in years. But every single tear is a tear of healing, a release. I'm finally letting it out. 

I've had some crazy health anxiety and I'll be getting some neurofeedback therapy done to help retrain my brain for stress and anxiety. The docs really wanted me on meds. But I didn't get off marijuana to go on pharmaceuticals. No thank you. 

For those of you struggling, it does get better with time. I think the reason most of us get sucked into a fog of anxiety and panic is because we don't know who we are without pot. We forget. It's like slipping away to Neverland and coming back to reality with all the feelings, emotions, thoughts and responsibility you tried to escape. It hits you so fucking hard, and you don't have ANYTHING to help carry you through it anymore. You're on your own. But that's the best fucking thing you can do for yourself. 

I'm not suspecting I'm out of the hills yet. But I'm prepared for anything now. I really think the worst is behind me. 

Things that help me:
Breathing 
Talking to friends and family about it even if I sound crazy
Reaching out for help from professionals
Setting timers to eat a healthy meal, and if it can't be healthy at least it's something!
Playing with my kids
Playing video games
Meditating
Being outside, although it's winter where I am and it fucking sucks outside so I stay in mostly lol
Vitamins
I'm trying to get back into exercise
Staying positive
Reminding myself this is NOT permanent and I did not break my brain. I'm not crazy. 
Seriously, meditating. I know I said it above, but you have no idea how helpful this is. 
Brain game aps
Lots of water
SLEEEEEEP

Backstory: I‚Äôm 3 months sober I quit because I wanted to get a better job to provide for my family. I‚Äôve been smoking daily since I was 16, a few times since then I had 3 month breaks no particular reason. I managed for Amazon in transportation for 3 years and smoked after a stressful day everyday and it just washed everything away. I felt like I could live in the moment. And focus on my kids and wife. I‚Äôm 23 years old with a 4 year old and 1 year old. All of a sudden they required a DOT drug test and that second I faked a phone call and got over a month of LOA (Leave Of Absence) I planned on getting clean and being able to pass a test afterwards. It was a solid and secure job that gave us plenty of financial stability. I didn‚Äôt stop smoking and pretty much forfeited my job. I failed my family that day, I got a 15.00 an hour job that allowed me to smoke weed but I started smoking from when I woke up until I went to sleep including at the job. I loved the smell of weed, the different strains and it‚Äôs effects, the taste, different bongs and pipes and joints. I looked forward to smoking and had no negative thoughts towards Mary Jane. 

The present: I quit smoking weed to obtain a better job and future for my family, putting us back on track, righting the wrongs I previously chose for my family. I am dreaming again, but I feel like my brain does not produce dopamine, nothing gets me excited or happy, I am easily irritable with my kids and with my wife. It is affecting my marriage, she is very understanding but she still smokes all day. I feel like I have a part of myself away and left a little empty. It has been 3 months now, in these 3 months I had 3 vehicles with engine or transmission that completely failed and were sold for scrap, my house had a roof leak professionals couldn‚Äôt figure out and rotted half my double wide mobile home (purchased in cash no landlord) after 2 months I thought I was cleared and interviewed for a job that pays 1500 a week after taxes. I got the job but 2 months was not enough time and my test came back positive for marijuana. I was so proud to have not smoked and have had no positive results for my sacrifice. I lost that job opportunity and my current job because of this. I‚Äôm at 3 month mark and am going to go for a job once again, just wish I could fast forward to having a car and good job and not just waiting for the next day to start. I am ready for results! 

Pros: hard to scrounge up but I guess everyday I smoked and drove I took the chance of getting a DUI and fucking my future. My wife smokes a lot less than I used to so I save money. I remember one time I really wanted to get high but my check was delayed so I asked a coworker for ‚Äúgas money‚Äù to pick up a gram after work. I remember picking through jars for scraps of weed to get a bowl to smoke. I remember smoking resin for a day or two if it wasn‚Äôt in the budget to smoke. 

The future: I will put away money every Check for a tattoo and a vacation fund. Doing a little something for myself since my sacrifice left me with no personal purpose. Vacation for family mental health and prosperity. I work a good job that affords everything we need, I eventually start to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù again, and can enjoy the fruits of my labor. Having something to prove for how hard this fight has been, marijuana can‚Äôt be in my future because of consistent drug tests, until it is federally decriminalized and employment drug screens are gone. I want to get excited again and be able to play with my kids not stressing or worrying about a damn thing.

It was really one of the greatest years of my life even though there was pandemic related hardship and uncertainty, falling in love and being dumped in a very sudden and unexpected way, loosing loved ones, working crazy hours or none at all, and having to smell my own breath 10 hours a day thanks to the masks.  

Simply being free of weed gave me clarity and strength to face every situation head on and make the best of it.  Or, rather, my clarity and strength to face every situation were not diminished by habitually intaking weed.

I managed to hold onto my job, got promoted and earn more money, moved into a much better apartment.  I learned to love myself this year, and that was the most important thing of all.  I quit smoking cigarettes, and became a darn good at my skating hobby.

However at some point around Thanksgiving I was in a funk and wanted to think outside the box or whatever.  Well, lemme tell ya, it didn't kill me but a lot of fears and doubts started to creep back in and those old familiar thought patterns were starting to show up.

If there is one thing I can say about abstaining from weed it is this: you will have more willpower, more control over your thoughts, more emotional intelligence, more awareness, and more power in your person.

There are some super successful functioning stoners out there, and thats totally cool for them, however the above list of positives is what i am in it for.

I have a great job (luckily with no random drug testing), and never thought much about my habit until a few years ago. I kept masking daily stresses with more and more weed, earlier ""start"" times, and chalked up my usage as a better alternative to drinking, prescription meds, etc. At the beginning of the pandemic, my connects were running low, so I stocked up big time on everything from gummies, to flower, and a decent amount of shatter. Unfortunately, even with the crazy amount of money spent on the biggest stash I've ever had on hand in my life, it was all gone in no time. I guess this was my wake up call.. Whether it was because I felt like shit (or a major piece of shit) or because I realized the stupid amount of money I'd just blown through, I just knew I had to step back and try to deal with things as a mf'ing adult.
Today marks 6 months since I quit, with one relapse. I have had to get a prescription sleeping pill since I've always battled insomnia, but I've been able to get on a lower dose ADD med, and my anxiety issues have become so much easier to handle. 
Looking back, I realize weed made things so much worse, even though I relied on it for relief from stress, anxiety, depression & insomnia. I'm starting to wonder what came first, the chicken or the egg? The weed or my craziness?!
Here's hoping that 2021 brings better days for us all, and that I can continue on with this weed-sober path, improving on things that still need fine tuning. Cheers, y'all.",48,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.39926583}"

I met my wife in 2014 and quit smoking pot for her.  I wouldn't smoke weed again until 9 months ago. At least not for more than the odd puff at a family gathering (once every couple years). 

The other side to the story: in college i not only smoked weed, but drank heavily and smoked cigarettes.  I drank alot more than i smoked pot...and over the ensuing years after i graduated i became a full swing drinker around the age of 23. Toss in the free drinks at work (i play piano in fancy restaurants and martini bars) and i was drinking like a pro. Every. Day. 

After getting serious with my girlfriend  (now wife) i quit pot because she didn't like it. I quit weed pretty painlessly.  Pot wasn't my big thing anyway.  

And then, kaboom.

After that my drinking went into the stratosphere.  A string of unfortunate events unfolded around me (parents both fell ill, wife diagnosed with cancer, volitility at work, among other big things) and my drinking and cigarette smoking got to dangerous levels. I went into inpatient rehab,  AA, cold turkey,  naltrexone, outpatient therapy, hypnosis. You name it. Nothing worked.  

9 months ago i almost broke a door falling down drunk on 2 bottles of wine and a few beers. By then i was also smoking 2 packs per day. This would be how i die, i figured. At 32 from hemorrhage or something. 

I had to act. I couldn't afford to NOT succeed at quitting alcohol. And i remembered my old college buddy: weed. Yes, good old weed. 

Not hard to find, almost legal, i guess.

 I made a plan: 

I would allow myself to smoke weed again, but i cannot under any circumstances go drink. If this means that I'm pretty much baked all day, well then so be it. If that means that i develop a substitute dependency on weed? So be it. Who cares. Who cares if i become a stoner? At least I'll be alive. At least i won't be drinking. Drinking was death. Weed was life. 

That was 9 months ago. I've smoked weed (virtually) every day, but i am 9 months sober off alcohol. I've never been able to go even 1 month without a drink, but here i am. 9 months without alcohol.  

Great twist: i also kicked cigarettes.  Unreal. After 12 years i quit literally a couple weeks after quitting alcohol.  And i owed it all to weed. 

I wasn't getting anything done from being stoned all day, but that didn't matter. It's a pandemic I'm stuck home either way. Piano gigs dried up. 

Well here i am now. Feeling soooooo much better without alcohol or cigs. It escapes me how i was so entranced by alcohol, i feel literally no emotional reaction walking by it or handing it to someone.  Bizarre really. Same for cigarettes.  I can't BELIEVE  how much my smell and taste have come back. And yeah, i can't believe my clothes smelled like that either! Feels amazing to be free from cigarettes.  

But now I'm dealing with this problem.  I'm ready to break free from weed and live sober, but i just struggle getting past it because i don't have something to REPLACE it with (like it had replaced another bad behavior). I also somewhere deep down really don't have any hard feelings about weed. I am just using it all the time now. And I'm really really struggling to stop. 

I feel like i need to build a mechanism of activities to enjoy after quitting,  because simply subtracting it from my life is not working for more than a few days. 

Anyone else been in a similar bind? Any input is appreciated.

I know this is not weed related, but I felt like relapse was imminate for weed or cigarettes; cigarettes seemed like the more rational option. I quit cigarettes almost two years ago, with a slip five months ago. It felt so great to smoke again; it was like the spark was still there. I haven‚Äôt smoked again, but there is a part of me that wants another one. 

I guess what is holding me back is my teeth, and my skin. My teeth get stained so bad from smoking, and I do want to age gracefully. There is a strong part of me that doesn‚Äôt care lately. I‚Äôm 27 years old and I have never been in a relationship. I‚Äôm gay and have a complete disconnect with others like me. I look ugly regardless of what I do to try and improve my appearance. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I lose weight, I‚Äôm never happy with how I look. 

I want to stop having hope that I will be in a relationship one day. I‚Äôve had this obsession to be beautiful since I was 17, but I never could achieve it. I was definitely anorexic when I was 17-19ish. I would really push myself to not eat, and my Mom was really freaked out because my ribs would stick out so bad.  Now I can‚Äôt stop eating, and I am a whale. I would try so hard to heal my acne, but I never could get it under control. I was so desperate to have clear skin, but unfortunately my medical history prevented me from getting accutane. I tried so hard to keep my teeth white, but they were never white enough to me; I was never enough. 

I haven‚Äôt showered or brushed my teeth in two days. My room is a wreck, and I just don‚Äôt have any desire to get up. My job that I was once okay with has become more of a drudgery lately. I don‚Äôt really want to be there. I try not to think too much of working until I die. It causes my mind to start wandering into a darker place. 

I will be sober ten months this month. I don‚Äôt go back because I know it will exasperate my mood swings and depression. I will start becoming erratic again. I just wish I could lock myself in my room and not work. I wish I didn‚Äôt worry about what people thought, and that addiction did not have consequences. It‚Äôs like I will never be high again. There will be no excitement or joy like when I got high. I will be stuck in this awkward existence that I can‚Äôt seem to adapt to.

However, I am also committing to a new path of no whining, no complaining, productively challenging my negative/depressive thoughts, and continuing to practice gratitude--even when it is hard; maybe especially when it is hard.  I have been much more focused on gratitude since getting clean again, and decided a nice new approach with no whining and no complaining would make a nice addition to my recovery!

But yeah, can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve made it this far.  I‚Äôve tried stopping before for a few months at a time, but always ended up giving in to daily heavy use, despite the constant back and forth in my mind, and the self blame and shame for being unable to stop.  

But last year I decided to go back to school (30, M), this time for massage therapy, and I really wanted to be clean and clear for it.  I think that since I had a purpose behind my cessation of smoking, it helped me stick to it a lot better.  

I‚Äôm definitely glad for my choice, and proud of myself, but I feel like I‚Äôm not outta the woods yet.  There are still days, and sometimes weeks, where I wish so so so hard that I could just relax with a nice j or a bong.  And the increasing acceptance of cannabis in the world doesn‚Äôt make it any easier.  All of my friends And coworkers smoke, I see and hear about it in shows and podcasts, read articles about it, and can‚Äôt go a block in Brooklyn without smelling it or seeing peoples business cards for it (lol!).  At this point the cravings are just annoying lol.  But I know from experience that I‚Äôm unable to be an occasional toker.  Every time I would slip back into smoking all day every day, so I know I can‚Äôt entertain the thoughts of ‚ÄúJust this once‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI deserve a break‚Äù.  

And I dream about it!  I dream that I‚Äôve accidentally smoked or forgot I had stopped, then I‚Äôm high and feeling guilty in my dream!  I‚Äôll wake up and be like ‚Äúfuck I can‚Äôt believe I threw away all that progress!  Wait....oh thank god that was just a dream‚Äù.  

And although I‚Äôve eliminated cannabis, unfortunately I‚Äôve been drinking much more often.  I attribute part of my proclivity to smoking or drinking to my ADHD.  I‚Äôve never had a good way to describe it, but my brain seeks to be stimulated or at least distracted most of the time, and drugs offer that quite well (never tried hard drugs, just weed alcohol caffeine and psychedelics.  Knowing myself I‚Äôm afraid to try anything else).  But I also don‚Äôt feel the same draw to alcohol as I do with weed, even though I have been drinking most nights.

Weed was the friend that made every day feel the same, stuck in a constant purposeless, hazy cycle where I didn't care about anything else but getting high.

I've been trying to breakup the friendship for over a year now --more actively in the last few months. I'm done with the fake friendship. I want to remember what it's like to be friends with myself. I've blocked myself for so long, always shutting out my inner thoughts and feelings, choosing to spend my time with weed instead.

Weed is a fucking clingy, manipulative friend that won't stop calling, but I'm blocking its number. I'm going to grieve the loss of everything it gave me, but this time, I'm going to let it go. And I'm so excited to see what I'll become without this deadbeat friendship dragging me down.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54912764}"

I haven't slept longer than 3 or 4 hours a night since I quit and I'm so miserable. I am so angry I did this to myself that it's hard to see clearly through it right now. 

This is as far as I could get before. Get to a week and think ""well if I feel this bad I should smoke a bowl, only on the weekends. Yeah, I'll do it once a week"". That's impossible though, because then I'll have a rough Monday and I hit another bowl. Then I'll think ""well shit, you know I feel alright I can smoke Tuesday, just one bowl"".

I still remember the first time we met back in my hometown. Some of my friends introduced me to you and I grew fond very quickly. It wasn't long till we got into trouble when I was 19. (36 now)

It was hard to say goodbye for a while and even when I was told that I had to stop I had a hard time doing so. I took a break from you for about a year or a year and a half when I was 22 or so. My roommates at the time were so into you that it made me realize the power that you could have over someone. 

I remember that night at the Incubus on the rocks concert that we got back together after our time apart.  You made me feel... Less, less pain, less joy, in fact I didn't really need to think or feel when we were together. You made me retreat from the social scene and helped me to feel numb. I didn't realize all that at the time but it takes some time away from you to know these things. 

People say you're not addictive, that there's no harm in seeing you daily, but that's something you say. You are intoxicating, you are beautiful and I love your smell. When we are together every day it seems to make life easy, free and thoughtless. 

But what is life about? Is it about expanding your horizons, or staying put? Is it about being who you are or who you (marijuana) want me to be? 

Without you I'm so much more assertive. You told me I'd be bored without you, and I believed it and held onto you, but now that we've been apart for a little over a month I can see that was just you praying on my insecurities. I am a better and stronger person without you in my life. You hold me back and make me wonder if I am good enough. You keep me in one place as if I'm floating there in one spot. 

I know I still have feelings for you, but time heals all wounds. I dont know if I should see you anymore. Maybe it's best we went our separate ways. I really don't want to conjur up old memories and am worried if you stop over again that might just happen. 

I'm gonna think about it for a while but for now please don't reach out. I think it's better that we are apart.

I threw out my second vape pen and all carts last night before going to sleep (I threw out my first vape pen a week or so ago because I had been privately and mentally preparing for my new beginning today). 

Well, I woke up this morning and the excitement for that first (barely-felt because of my high tolerance) high wasn‚Äôt there to latch on to. Because my vape pen was in the trash, remember? I threw it out last night. I can tell you that I didn‚Äôt do so wholeheartedly, but my head always knows what I actually want (before the anxious thoughts kick in), so I followed my mental plan of action and tossed it. 

So no excitement this morning. Immediate anxiety instead. Anxious thoughts kick in and about ten minutes later, I was in my new low.

I dug my pen and a cart out of the trash. I cleaned and sanitized both. I vaped. There you go. 

I want to get to know my sober self. I want to face my fear of letting go. I want soooo much to be strong enough. I want more financial freedom. I want my body to adjust itself to its ‚Äúnatural‚Äù state. I want that for my mind as well. I want to have better focus and to be able to read books again. I want to give this a try but as soon as I think about completely letting go, I feel my stomach drop, my anxiety kick in, and my thoughts start to race. The inner battle consumes me and I end up going straight for my known comfort - marijuana. 

I think I need a minute-by-minute guide on how to face this thing. I don‚Äôt even know. I probably just need some magic or a miracle. I feel so selfish and bratty even complaining about this struggle because it seems so minute in comparison to the real struggles in this world.

I‚Äôm not feeling bad or sad for myself. I‚Äôve decided to open up and share. Maybe even get some kind of accountability from posting this? I really don‚Äôt know.

Good luck to us all. I‚Äôm truly inspired by all of you and hope that I can win this battle sooner than later.

I have 2 teenage children,I am a professional in my field with a master‚Äôs degree I was proud to complete at the age of 40. Weed was a constant presence in my life and not a roadblock to my goals (I thought). I was raised on weed, literally. My parents grew up in the 60s in South Florida and smoked and grew weed my whole childhood and adolescence. My mother used marijuana during pregnancy and a year of breastfeeding me. They did a lot of things great in raising my siblings and I, but normalizing drug and alcohol use was not one of them.  I started smoking the roaches and weed leftovers from my parents at age 12. Weed was plentiful and easily accessible as it was laying in the coffee table ash tray along with the cigarettes there.  My parents eventually figured it out and didn‚Äôt care. I was openly toking with them and my siblings by age 15.  Some of my siblings as well as my parents also used harder drugs, but I credit the book ‚ÄúThat Was Then This is Now‚Äù by SE Hinton for scaring me straight as a kid- I was too scared to try anything harder and never have, thankfully. Also, the crack epidemic hit my Davie, FL neighborhood pretty hard in the 80s and seeing some of the mothers of my close friends transition to skinny, feigning junkies was impressionable to my young psyche. 

Fast forward to Thanksgiving 2020. I am an anxious, absent-minded  , and aloof middle aged woman who can‚Äôt seem to make myself happy, despite all my blessings. Great job, amazing husband (not a smoker), and healthy kids- yet I was never satisfied. Reading about marijuana use and it‚Äôs effects on the brain over time led to me decide to quit. I had smoked for 30 years off and on, the longest break spanning 5 years during my back-to -back pregnancies and breast feeding stints. Since then, I had tried many times to quit- taking tolerance breaks and going months without, but always went back to smoking every time due to anxiety, depression, boredom etc. Why is this time different? I really don‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm not naive enough to fully believe I‚Äôm done forever, I don‚Äôt want to be over confident. But I flushed all my weed and threw out my paraphernalia 35 days ago and haven‚Äôt looked back since. It feels different this time- I feel more confident that I‚Äôm able to handle life without it. And more than just handle it- I am present in my relationships with my family and I feel so much better. Clear head, less dread, and more energetic about future goals than ever before. This is one of my very first posts on Reddit, despite lurking for awhile. Felt compelled to tell my story and admit weed has been a barrier to my personal growth. This sub has been a big motivator to quit. Thanks to all who post. I‚Äôm not smoking today. Happy 2021 to the leavers.

I did so because I did not want to use opioids and I could not sleep or get comfortable after the surgery. I kept taking the capsules for sleep well after my shoulder healed enough to allow me to get comfortable in bed. In the beginning I would occasionally use a flower vaporizer during the day and tinctures at night. As November approached I started smoking very high THC flower to help me relax before bed in addition to capsules. During late October and early November I started to have insomnia which I attributed to election anxiety but when it persisted even after the election anxiety waned, I became anxious and started making doctor's appointments to get sleeping pills. No pill seemed to work and if one did allow me to get to sleep it didn't last more than a couple of hours. The only 8 hours I got were induced by lots of high THC flower and numerous other over the counter pain killers and prescription sleeping aids (which I was warned not to combine). At this point I became convinced that this was unsustainable. I then did a bit of research on cannabis and decided it was time to quit. On December 10, 2020 I quit. It was horrible for the first several days as expected but the insomnia persists to date and the sleeping pills do little.

On a side note, my gf got extremely drunk and I was not pleased one bit. I cannot stand excessive drinking - it doesn't happen often with her, but when it does she loses her fking mind and literally doesn't make sense when she talks.  Perhaps it could be the combination of pretty heavy drinking (\~8 drinks including 2 shots) and her anxiety medication she takes regularly - not sure if/when she took it yesterday but if its effects are anything like xanax, I know mixing those two is a disaster.

I've been a daily smoker for about 8 years now, and what started as a bit of fun and a way to switch off my mind quickly spiralled into a nasty addiction. I always tried to justify it by telling myself that I wasn't addicted and that a bit of weed wasn't going to hurt me. Pretty soon I would start getting high before everything I did, just because I felt like it made everything better. I would lose hours at a time by playing online games and scrolling mindlessly through the same four social media apps on my phone, all while baked out of my mind. It has led to battles with my mental health as well as losing friendships, but all the while I could never admit to myself that it was the weed that was the problem. 


When I met my girlfriend at the end of 2019, she soon found out about my habit and I would often rip my bong in front of her. After a few months, she expressed her dislike of me doing it so I hid it from her. At least, I thought I did. Two months ago, she confronted me and told me that she knew I was still getting high every day and threatened to leave me unless I made changes. Our relationship was otherwise pretty great and I loved her, so I promised that I would stop. That lasted one day before I had a stressful day at work and immediately went back to my bong for comfort. 


Christmas Day was the final straw for her. We got back from lunch at my parents house and while she was in the shower I went downstairs and ripped a cone. Straight away she smelled it on me and blew up at me and left in a huff, going back to her place. 
The next day, she left me because she said she wasn't able to trust me anymore. I'm absolutely devastated. We were making all sorts of plans for our future, and now they're totally gone because I couldn't fucking control myself. 


I'm writing this for my own benefit because I think writing it down is cathartic, but I know this is such a positive community and any support I get from you guys is a bonus. I've thrown out my bong and the rest of my smoking stuff, and have booked in to see a therapist that specialises in addiction so I can start to fix this problem. I've spent years squashing any negative emotions that I feel with weed and now I'm having to deal with the break up totally sober, which is really, really hard for me.


My now ex-girlfriend and I are still on good terms, so I'm hoping that my efforts to quit will be a step in the right direction of being able to be together again someday. And even if we don't, then at least I'm going to be living a much healthier lifestyle moving forward.",50,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.56920516}"

Most recently Id just take bong tokes of a nice hybrid to have a steady high when I‚Äôm at home and don‚Äôt smoke usually while I‚Äôm at work. I quit smoking cigarettes in the past 6 months and also reduced my weed intake substantially. I‚Äôve been smoking less recently than I have in years. 

I really didn‚Äôt think quitting would be difficult. if fact, I didn‚Äôt think weed had much of an impact on my life despite being constantly high.  I always considered myself a very functional stoner, I do my college level math homework high, drawings for my job high, run my business, I‚Äôm not forgetful or messy. Weed helped to bring me out of my shell and made me more social.

I really just quit as I was worried about the long term affects of smoking, and just to prove to myself that I wasn‚Äôt dependent.

Today was the roughest, I‚Äôd had small cravings that were easily quashed before this.
Granted it is New Year‚Äôs Eve, synonymous with being social and partying. I knew being alone was going to be hard, but it hit much harder than I expected. In writing this I still haven‚Äôt smoked, nor will.

Around 9pm I just felt profoundly sad, i don‚Äôt know how else to explain. I did yoga for 45 mins and it helped Immensely, I felt amazing again. 

Then midnight hit and I heard all the yelling and had major sadness again, I just felt soo alone. I cried for the first 15 minutes of the new year and just felt pathetic. I had tossed my bong and all my weed stuffs when I quit so I ended up just sipping on vodka straight from the bottle to help soothe.

I think I‚Äôm going to reach out to a professional for help, judging by the majority of posts here I understand these feelings seem to pass. But I already have a extremely healthy lifestyle, so I don‚Äôt know what else I can do. I personally don‚Äôt have addiction issues with alcohol so it got me though today but I otherwise would not have gone this route.

I wont go into a whole 1 year reflection because there are plenty on here and you know the benefits that await you when you kick the habit. I suppose all I want to do is encourage those that have made the decision. Stick with with it. There is no better time to quit than now. 

It is a couple weeks of shitty sleep to get to months/years of restful, gratifying sleep. It is a few weeks of mood swings to get to a more calm and happier version of yourself.

32 years old, and been smoking more or less daily since age 20. I've tried countless times over the years to ""cut back"" or quit all together, but have never really managed to gain control over my use of weed in my day to day life. I always held out hope that I could be the type of person who could have weed in the house and not need to smoke it so I could have it for special occasions, but I've had to accept that that's just not the case. For some reason I can't seem to control myself around it. 

So I'm taking it out of the equation completely. This has been challenging for me however because the idea of permanency is so heavy for some reason. It's been hard for me to think about quitting ""forever"". So I've decided not to smoke for all of 2021. As a start. 

I'm trying to fool myself into quitting for good, and since I can't wrap my head around forever, I'm starting with 1 year. 1 year feels doable. I've been growing my hair for 5 years to donate it. I've been vegetarian for 16 years. 1 year? Pshh... I can do that. Right?

So here's to putting 2020 behind us and leaving the bad habits with it. 
Here's to a healthier more productive 2021.

(F 27) It‚Äôs day 21 for me after heavy daily usage for the past 6yrs. I had to quit due to being on probation. 

A little back story about that. I was in a single car wreck 1yr ago, totaled car, bruised ribs no serious damage. By the grace of God we did not hurt anyone but ourselves. My boyfriend was driving my car under the influence / after having a concussion (I was unaware at the time he fell down a flight of stairs before deciding to drive me home after a night of drinking). I thought I would pass the sobriety test / breathalyzer because I hadn‚Äôt drank as much as he did. He was obviously not coherent and had a previous misdemeanor for POM several years ago so I took the fall and unfortunately blew over the legal limit. .085. Spent 36hrs in custody. Going through the PTI program, had to do community service, take classes and pay fees monthly and have calls with my PO. I‚Äôve been on probation since for almost the full year and fortunately have not been drug tested, but I‚Äôm nearing the finish line and I know I will be drug tested soon so I decided to quit cold turkey 21 days ago. The withdrawals are real. Chills, fever, headaches, irritability, loss of appetite. They are no joke in the first week. It DOES get better. Everyone‚Äôs turning point is different so do not get discouraged with the speed of your progress!

It‚Äôs now New Year day and my family / friends are all smoking around me. I had to ask my boyfriend to refrain because it‚Äôs still very hard for me to be around it and I do feel like he should at least not smoke weed while I can‚Äôt either due to me taking the fall for the accident. That was my first offense EVER. :/ Everyone‚Äôs drinking and smoking and having a ton of fun and I‚Äôm trying hard to have fun too, but the temptation is very much there! I came here to vent a little and read other people‚Äôs sobriety stories for extra motivation. I do feel like the fog in my head is clearing a little after visiting this group.

Being summer here I should able to work up a sweat quite easily so I'll forget the sauna for now.

I'm scared of the next couple of weeks to be honest with you. As this is not my first time to quit I know what to expect and not looking forward to it. Who knows? Maybe this time will be different and I certainly have a lot of tools in my kit to help me get through it. Going back to work in about 2 1/2 weeks is the scariest thing of all, and partly why I have been smoking so much more the last 13 years. I am seriously considering getting out of it and taking my chances that something else will come up. I would have to do this by Monday after the week-end, but, to make a decision like that during withdrawals is possibly not wise? Or what has been on my mind for the past 10-11 years needs to be acted upon? Unable to be acted upon whilst stoned.

A lot of anxiety arises for me regarding action. What if it's the wrong action and later have regrets? During my 2016 quit I acted on something relating to work, complained about a colleague who was bordering on sexual harassment. It was scary, and very awkward, but after that things changed for the better, first example. Last week I tried to quit and again, I acted on something that had been bothering me for a long time. It was all a bit terrible, and thank god my friend was here to hold my hand, as it was a legal issue and some letters went back and forth between our lawyers. Bit scary, but I feel better now that the issue is as resolved as it is ever going to be and I feel I can move on from that issue now, more or less legally have to, but I feel better about it as the people who hurt us (me and my husband) now know, just how much. It's one of those things there's nothing you can really do.

Maybe if I finally act on this last thing with quitting that job, maybe things could really work out? The smoking is definitely a problem I've needed to act on, so I am now doing that. Just this last problem!!!
