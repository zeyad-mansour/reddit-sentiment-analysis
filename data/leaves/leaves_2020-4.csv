Everything in my life has been coming together besides my addiction to marijuana.  I got a solid career started, quit nicotine awhile ago and was justifying my heavy marijuana use of 5 years or so because of quitting nicotine. Now I was forced to quit because I ran out of edibles and I am immunosuppressed so I can’t go to the dispensary. All that being said I am currently experiencing nausea, hot and cold flashes, headache, fatigue during the day and no appetite. My question is, is this normal? And what can I do to help. I currently workout a bunch but I have been burning more calories than I can physically eat right now so I’m thinking about taking a break from working out. I am on Day 4 of these symptoms so I am hoping this is normal and not COVID or something! Also I’m glad this sub exists and any advice is appreciated.",2,2

Day sixer here.

Have any of you dealt with purely automatic actions, without cravings, intent or desire?

I found myself doing something downstairs, and when i finished, I apparently grabbed a lighter and went out to the garage to smoke. I dont remember any of this... I wasnt craving at all... BUT I do know that in the past, whenever I did that thing, I would go smoke after.

Thank $deity i had destroyed and thrown out my paraphernalia and weed, because i KNOW that if it was there, I would have smoked, and not realised until it was too late.

i managed to survive this time... but holy crap what about the next 5000 triggers I dont know about?

Has anyone experienced this, this kinda fugue, where you are a passenger in your own body, completing a ritual? If so, how did you get through it?

Thank you!",3,0

Weed has been a huge part of my social and sexual life for the past 3 years. I didn't expect to quit when I did, although a huge part of it was that I ran out and didn't feel like spending the money anymore. So 10 days ago I decided that I was done, that I wanted new and better things for my life and that weed was holding me back. Around day 8, I craved and craved and texted my best friend (super functional daily MJ user) that I needed a ""save"" (that's how you call it here in Brazil when someone's generous enough to share their weed with ya). She's a lovely friend and holds zero judgement against me and the fact that I decided to quit. So I smoked and daaaaaaaaaaamn how I missed it. I didn't feel guilty at all, 'cause I've been able to notice that weed is mostly destructive for me when I make it a solo/frequent habit. It felt really good to smoke again, but I still remain committed to not doing it on my own and everyday. I cheated, but oh well, isn't that part of the process?

With all of that said, I had a couple of things happen to me in the mean time, good and bad. 

I started journaling everyday and I'm working out again, which feels awesome. I am more present at work and my relationship with my parents has improved. I painted my bedroom walls. I am active and full of energy during mornings and it feels good to have a little extra motivation hanging around. HOWEVER, evening/nights are scary as shit. I got semi-dumped a couple of days ago and my semi-partner used to be my weed buddy, my go-to friendly dick, my dealer at times even. Not really handling it that well, but very aware that the ""break-up"" is preventing me from smoking when I shouldn't too. Add that to my current ""night-anxiety"" and you get my current state. I find myself in the middle of an anxiety attack almost every day around the same time. This gets me wondering, right? Is it withdrawal, still? Is it me? Is it quarantinew Can I just not function without it at night? Should I start again and just be more cautious this time? Should I just try to quit when quarantine's over and I can incorporate other practices to my life?

Part of me knows that I might just indulge in it again and get disconnected from all the goodness that is coming/will come from the decision. Part of me just doesn't really give a crap and wants to start doing it again as soon as possible. I honestly just want stop feeling shitty like I do, when I do. 

Again, having this place to rant about this is just lovely and it always helps when you guys engage in conversation with me. If you read until here: thanks! If you have any tips to deal with this uncertainty and crazy withdrawal anxiety, I am actively listening. 

Be safe in these crazy times, y'all.",5,2

So many people do this and are happy with their lives. There comes a time when you have to really think about how weed is affecting you and your life. Being a pothead, I felt like I was only living half a life. Wake up, smoke, eat, school, smoke again, gym, and a smoke before bed. Everyone noticed that I changed, and I knew it. My health wasn’t as good, I always looked tired and high, and I had nothing else to look forward to except smoking. Honestly, I got so sick and tired of feeling this way. Everyday was the exact same thing. The problem was that I needed weed to function. Weed was the only thing I looked forward to. This makes me so upset, because my dreams and ambitions were clouded by abusing weed. BE THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE. if you are happy not being yourself, and half of your possible potential, then go right ahead and keep smoking. Regret is the worst feeling, and I promise you that you will regret not quitting when you get older, and you realize that the only thing you looked forward to was smoking weed.

Wouldn't have made it here if it wasn't for you all<3,"I work four 10hr shifts a week so I get three days off.  I also work at a dispensary, grow weed at home, and have been a heavy user for a few years...  My previous three day weekend I spent smoking copious amounts of cannabis and playing video games just dreadfully waiting for my next day at work.  I realized over those three days I really didn't get high, it just made me sleepier.  I was also starting to notice some feelings that I used to associate with depression.  So I figured it was time for a change.  I decided I was going to take a tolerance break for a week or so and try to come back to just maybe a bowl a night.  


Day 1 was really tough.  I was jittery, I had this pressure headache all day, and of course my appetite was destroyed.  I took a melatonin to help me get to sleep (i do not plan to substitute weed with melatonin for sleep).  
Today is Day 2 and I woke up feeling refreshed.  no more headache.  my appetite is still botched and my stomach hurts.  I do not know if the pain is from hunger or anxiety.  being addicted to a substance is not something I want so I feel like I'm making myself anxious by subconsciously overthinking all this!

Since stumbling upon this subreddit my new goal is to no longer partake!  Ever since I was little I've had horrible anxiety and was put on medication for it around high school.  I've been off the prescriptions for just over a year which is awesome and I felt much better.  I have on the other hand not been off cannabis or medication since 9th grade.  I know my stomach hurts because I need to learn to control my own anxiety and reading your posts have been very helpful for easing my pain and I just wanted to thank you all again.

15,2020-04-29 18:51:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gajoxp/what_weed_gave_me/,What weed gave me,"I've been reflecting a lot about why I started smoking and what exactly caused me to want to stop. I've come up with a couple of things and I felt like this was a great way to not only archive them for myself later and share them!

I don't know if this sentiment or reason is shared with a lot of people, but I started smoking as a social mechanism to help fight loneliness. I just got out of HS and wanted to have a better social life in college. So, when someone offered to smoke, I mostly said yes because I wanted to feel like I belonged and fit in. 

This is what weed really gave me: friendships, meaningful relationships, and memorable experiences, and this gift is what will come back to help me.

Before my current streak of 47 days, I had gone 8 months in my first attempt to quit. This round of withdrawals has been way tougher and I wanted to figure out why while also tackling on the reasons I relapsed back in September.

I have a shit ton more cravings than I had before, and I realized that most of my cravings come when I'm by myself, feeling kind of down and lonely (thanks COVID). During my last attempt, it was so much easier because I had my sober friends and people to talk to and experiences to have and look forward to. Now, and back when I relapsed, I was extremely lonely, hoping to fit in with my roommates, and lacked a lot of the social experiences I had before. This led to relapse so I had more reasons to be with people, and cravings now because I'm longing for those friendships and experiences.

I never realized this kind of social motivation was at the root of my issues. In previous reflection, I always summed up my addictions with pressures of school, escape from depression, or something to motivate me to be productive. It's really refreshing and reassuring to know what exactly was the root cause of why I went to weed, and what could cause me to relapse!

Now I take more precautions, I'm figuring out what it feels like when I'm lonely, and I do a better job at reaching out to people via phone or something to quell the social craving so I don't start going back somehow (I don't have any paraphernalia either which is so helpful!).

I'm really looking forward to day 50! Not everyday is great (many of them have been pretty shitty tbh), but I know it's going to get better and better the further I get. Keep on pushing peeps!! We've got this!",6,1

I can almost simultaneously think of it as the best and worst thing going.

The positives include introspection and reflection on the state of the world and myself, as well as a whole load of laughs and great times with my closest friends. 

But with that comes a lethargy and disconnection with absolutely everything that doesn't involve a few cheeky tokes.

Even though I can see that the greater world has value and beauty I can't seem to appreciate it properly or be content with myself, family, friends or partner outside of a cloud of smoke.

Also a few times I've made the decision to stop and haven't smoked for months at a time. Then I end up thinking about the good times of blazing with friends having a laugh etc, and easily fall back into smoking again.    -   This is despite the fact that there have been times in my life where I have been unable to socialise at all unless I was smoking.


I can see the tentacles of addiction in my mind, yet I'll still roll a spliff and give in to it. 

I think to myself I shouldn't smoke, 
   proceed to roll a spliff,
      again think that I shouldn't smoke this,
             (un)happily spark it up anyway. 


The reason I am quitting (again) is because of the effects weed has had and continues to have on my mental health, relationships, career goals, and really every area of my life.

Sometimes I'll attribute these negative effects to other things and use weed as the cure - that is the nature of my addiction I suppose. 

Anyway if anyone's still reading this, sorry its a bit rambley but reading the experiences, thoughts and feelings of fellow leaves has definitely helped me solidify my own perspective so perhaps you'll be able to take something from this too.",54,0

Fell asleep pretty bloody easy last night, but unfortunately pretty feel sickly in the stomach. That said, I really enjoyed hiking, and was seriously considering using it as a running path, until I came upon a grizzly's kill, with proof it was still in the area. Not comfortable running out there, basically announcing myself as prey... especially with headphones on.

Started brushing my teeth properly again on day 2, and the bleeding has slowed down. already. Further, my mouth doesnt hurt nearly as much in response to prolonged physical activity.

My mood has kinda went from somber and introspective, to slghtly irritable, buy that's okay.. Pretty sure it will pass, and lockdown helps make sure i don't do something stupid like snap at someone who doesn't deserve it. 

I am optimistic about today... if only because yesterday I saw that i could still have moments of high like bliss, without any intoxication.

I remember... when I first started smoking pot, that every single thought, or conversation seemed so profound and deep. Of course they weren't, and it was just incoherent gibberish in most cases... but now, in the first few days of sobriety, how deep, profound, and connected everything feels.... And though i'm not sure if its good or bad, the irony and humour isn't lost on me.

I fear I may be idolizing a bit. Among other things, I am a programmer. Could easily smoke my bong, and pound out 10-20k lines in one session, or often stay up for multiple days to try and (fail miseribly... i have terrible completion records for doing anything) finish it. 

A big problem with this though is a) racing and obsessive thoughts made me go down far too many rabbit hole to ""see if its possible"" b)in general the code was never optimised. lots of IF/ELSE loops, instead of singular for array, or commented. c)I would be trying to manage the structure, remember all the variable, functions, etc, all in my head, and it quite often self imploded. d) if i spotted a glitch later, when sober, I wouldnt be able to fix it, because i wouldnt be able to understand the code, the decisions made, the thought process..

Today I felt something real, something palpable that I haven’t felt in years. It was like my body and mind were operating at peak efficiency and in perfect sync with one another. 

Woke up early (my sleep schedule is already 10x better than it was before I quit. Sleep from 12-9 or so instead of 4-1, but that’s beside the point), ate breakfast, and ran a few miles. That’s when I noticed how unbelievable I felt, both physically and mentally.

It was a feeling that had never been accomplished through chasing fleeting body highs. I felt for the first time in a long time that I was on the right track in life, offering a sense of accomplishment and a complete lack of guilt over my life choices, past and present. It embodied a feeling of almost child-like wonder, an overwhelming rush that made me just want to dance and celebrate, not giving a fuck about who was looking at me randomly exploding during a mid-day run. At first, I didn’t even know what to do with myself because I had no idea what was happening. But I’m here for all of it.

I do have panic disorder and depression which I am in treatment for.

Last year (literally to the month), I tried to quit smoking weed after leaving a bad relationship I was in since I was 15. I made it one day of not smoking before I went and stayed at my brother’s house because my anxiety was so bad I was scared to be alone. After a few days I caved and made my mom and brother take me to the ER because my anxiety was so bad my skin was crawling and I was basically in a psychotic state due to being so consumed by my own anxious thoughts. I ended up caving and restarted smoking. 

Fast forward to now, due to the joys of COVID-19 both me and my current boyfriend are stuck home and just ran out of weed last night. Due to the finances we can’t go pick up more and I can already feel the shit show starting again. I’ve been on the couch crying all day, having cold sweats and nauseous. I know this seems like I’m being dramatic and withdrawal symptoms usually take a few days to start getting bad. However, this is the second time I’ve quit cold turkey in the past few years and both times get super bad withdrawals only 12 hours into not smoking. 

Has anyone else felt weed withdrawal this severe before? This soon? 

I do have a genetic disorder that causes my body to process everything too fast, so I’m assuming that’s why my symptoms hit sooner than an average person (12 hours sober compared to a day or two). However, I have yet to read about people having EXTREME anxiety to the point of psychosis.",9,1

I was so excited to have a good amount of weed to last through hopefully the rest of this COVID ridiculousness. Then I rolled a joint and smoked the whole thing down to the filter.... No buzz. Took about an hour and packed a bowl... No buzz. The next day I woke up with terrible stomach pain and a crazy desire to smoke. Once again packed a bowl and threw my last remaining kief on it. Got a small buzz for about 15 minutes. Now I'm thinking WTF this weed is so terrible I can't even keep withdrawal symptoms at bay. 

Cut to this Monday and I decided fuck it. If this weed has such little THC in it that I can't even get hi anymore why even bother. I've always wanted an excuse or a reason to force myself to quit, and here I am. Stuck in my house for the foreseeable future with terrible weed. I decided to go cold turkey. 

It is not easy, not because I want to smoke, but withdrawal is a bitch. I've posted earlier about my stomach issues that have come up and they really seem to be my biggest issue. I've seen multilple people on this forum asking about things they've been able to eat or substitutes for meals. I'm no expert but here was my first three days

Day 1 (hadn't quit but weed was so bad): 1 piece of toasted bread and a hard boiled egg, then I had honey nut Cheerios which I threw up almost immediately. 

Day 2: 8ish bites of watermelon, and a smoothie

Day 3: some grapes and oatmeal, also managed a small amount of raisin Bran crunch. Finished 2 tacos around 11pm took an hour to eat them 

Day 4: I have had water so far. But my appetite is definitely returning. 

I hope some of you can relate and hopefully take an idea or two. We got this guys. No plant is gonna run my life.",6,2

Thank you SO much to this group for existing. For many years I felt like I was the only person on earth who would dig through the trash to find the bowl I tossed out the night before to scrape the measliest bits of resin from it.  It was so sad feeling like I was completely insane for doing this with a drug that was supposedly not addictive. Being a female in this situation was also really isolating. I really don’t feel alone anymore and I think that’s been the missing piece. 

Someone yesterday posted about Allen Carr’s books for quitting weed and alcohol. I wanted to throw out another amazing book which made me quit drinking called “This Naked Mind” by Annie Grace. It basically reverse-brainwashed me into being disgusted with alcohol and nothing I’ve tried so far has ever worked like this. I hope to use Allen Carr’s book on smoking, which has a similar premise to Grace’s book, to hopefully get the same effect related to weed. Anyways, just wanted to mention “This Naked Mind” to anyone who’s interested; I cannot recommend it enough.

I'm just looking for some opinions. And maybe some guidance. 

Since this whole quarantine thing started, I have been smoking more than ever before. It's not an all day thing, but for the past month or so it has been every night about an hour or two before me and my girlfriend go to sleep.

Basically my day goes like this, and has been like this every day since being stuck inside:

9:00AM - 5:00PM: work from home.

5:00PM - 6:00PM: go for a walk with my girlfriend around the block to get our 6k steps in for the day.

6:00PM - 9/10:00PM: shift focus from actual job to my personal art and graphic design projects (catching up with client orders, requests, revisions etc).

10:00PM: make dinner and smoke with my girlfriend. Eat, watch some YouTube docs and KO.

I never smoke when I have to get work done but since all of this started it has been my absolute go to method of winding down at the end of the night after 10+ hours of staring at a computer. I always used to be the ""I like smoking but would never want to do it every day"" guy, and here I am smoking every night before bed.

It hasn't cut into my productivity, but I find myself getting more and more reflective on who I am as a person when I'm high now. Sometimes so much that I get legitimately upset, over analyzing every interaction I had throughout the day and thinking ""wow, I wonder if I came off weird. What if everyone really just things I'm super weird"" blah blah blah, you know the thought process. It doesn't happen every time, but it's there and it gives me a lot of self doubt sometimes.

Just looking for some input on if I am being too critical of myself, and of my smoking.",13,1

I accomplished a lot more than I have smoking. I workout and care more about being healthy sober. I can study and retain information for college. And care for people around me. 

I'm writing this because I have been smoking non-stop for the last 3 months. It's kinda all I think about, I thought I wanted to ""enhance"" my entertainment, is the excuse I told myself. Or I'm not harming anyone, so why not?

Well I was chasing a high, then eventually I start needing more to get that high. More money spent, and time wasted. 

Maybe some people can be productive when high. But for me, it makes me okay with being mediocre and stagnant. Like, I don't care if I gain weight or my hygiene gets worse. My grades start slipping. I start to isolate because I'd rather get high after work then socialize. I become lethargic and lazy. I started coughing up grey loogeys, which doesn't happen sober. 

I'm just warning for whoever might be like me, it will go back to old times, where a wake and bake is what I wake up to. I smoke as soon as I get in my car off work. I then smoke about every two hours till I go to bed. Then wake up and do it again ×5 days a week. And then on the weekend it's even more. It will go back to consuming your time. 

I hope to save people from having a similar experience, because it does hurt a little I wasted time yet again. And failed yet again at staying sober. But to keep trying! I'm happy people are willing to share there experience, it really does help knowing others have done the same, but keep trying as well!",18,0

I would like to cheerfully inform you that I too have made the leap into the Abstinent Life. I started to consume daily at the age of 12 and I am currently doing my second withdrawal attempt. I am now 19 years old and I am now almost 48 days free of tobacco and also of weed. Yesterday I got my official admission date for rehabilitation in the clinic and I am very happy, because I am now on sick leave since October, just hanging around at home and finally some change in my life. It is quite hard to get used to the abstinent life, but I think after some time you will have arrived there well. To all those who are trying to quit: Pick it up and stick with it, even if it doesn't work out right away. I was completely abstinent for a year (with 16), but then I relapsed completely due to some deaths in the family, short term homelessness and a separation. Do not give up hope!

My family doesn't have a smoking history. I started off weed when I was 19, liked the high. Back then it was occasional, then I started doing daily during June - November 2019. It caused nothing except a huge decline in my IQ and heavy cognition problems. I used to get angry even at small problems and avoided social hangouts and responsibilties, to the extent that I started stealing at home to feed my addictions, i.e cigarettes weed and alcohol. I've overdosed on alcohol thrice. Like I was literally crazy and dumb you know. Last year when I was smoking weed daily, I had developed tolerance and was literally irritated if I didn't get the substance for a single day. Now I'm 123 days off cigarettes as well. I hope my intelligence doesn't turn against me. I'm literally sick of myself at this point. I've smoked weed twice in train as well. Please pray for my recovery.

I don’t remember much of the last 3 years, it was such a haze. A whole lot of broken friendships &amp; relationships, a lot of lying to loved ones, flunking out of college, exploiting my parents for money and wasting it all, giving myself excuses to smoke at any time I can, feeling anxious 24/7, and, of course, endless self-pity. 

A year ago I got hooked on nicotine and alcohol as well, I would drink to feel a buzz and then smoke a blunt with one part weed &amp; one part tobacco so that it would make me feel light headed. My clothes reeked of weed and tobacco, as did my bag and my car Completely abused my body in the process. 

A year ago my daughter was born and I still didn’t stop even though I knew I had to. I continued with this life selfishly and callously. 45 days ago my parents had to practically beg me to get a hold of myself, and I begrudgingly said OK to them while feeling deep inside that in reality I would not change. But then the pandemic hit and the choice was taken out of my hands. I kept making plans to pick up from my plug but I found myself holding back from pulling through with it. Even though it felt nearly impossible for me to sleep, I somehow felt better by the 5th day of sobriety.

On the 7th day, a wave of clarity hit me like a pile of bricks. Suddenly I could vividly see the disgusting person I had become. The terrible father, terrible son and terrible friend that I had turned into. All the mistakes I had made began to run through my head. The extent of my failure in the last 3 years made me feel like there was a clenched fist around my heart squeezing ever so tighter. Right then and there I swore off all the substances I was abusing- but particularly weed. Weed was the drug that I was always easily able to justify, it was the drug that had turned me into a cold, unfeeling, unthinking chunk of flesh. I had designed my daily schedules around its procurement for the last 3 years. I had wasted away several hours being too stoned to do absolutely anything worthwhile. I had forgotten how to enjoy things without being high. Being high on weed all the time destroyed my social life, I avoided friends and family, I avoided talking to anyone at all.

In any case, I can literally feel my mind returning to me. The haze is gone, the eternal phlegm in the back of my throat is gone, the red droopy eyes are gone, the crushing anxiety is gone. I’ve been actively taking care of my daughter everyday for the past month so far and she’s the reason I know I can never go back to the old me. Every aspect of my life is looking better now, I feel stronger mentally and emotionally. This reddit helped in no small part by breaking my stoner culture believes that “weed can’t be harmful”, “you can’t get addicted to weed”, “you can be a functioning stoner” etc, thank you! 

I hope I can return here and update you all with a “100 day sober” post in which I describe my story in some greater detail. Thank you all!",6,1

I am 18 and had been using daily for about a year and a half, up until the Friday before last.

I used daily like I said, but towards the end (last 3 months I'd say) I've only been using about one or two hits of a dab a day, right before bed. Occasionally there were days I'd use more but only like 5 hits in a day maximum. At two hits a day on average, is it possible I was using less than most people here, and didn't get as dependent as most do?

Was I a light user or something? It sure felt like I was doing it too much and I was dependent. Will I experience anything more than a small craving? Because this is manageable, and I expected something much more difficult to overcome.",2,0

Feels surreal checking that 1month marker on my grounded app and realizing how much money I am saving 🤑 , as well as how much my mental state has improved. 

When it comes to substances, I think we all have formed deeply rooted connections and established relationships that serve all kinds of purposes in our lives. For me alcohol and specifically weed was the only way I learnt to be a little easier on myself and deal with the negativity in my life . I always struggled with perfectionism and was never okay with not being okay, that’s where substance played such an integral role at the beginning of my use.

To start off with I thought this relationship was healthy. Didn’t ace that test, well I could smoke a J and run away from those feelings, at least for a bit. It beat staying up all night beating myself up for a bad grade. Quickly drugs and alcohol became my go to when anything in my life wasn’t exactly how I wanted it to be. 

Year by year as my usage went up , I didn’t realize how numb I was becoming to all of life around me. Breaking up with my girlfriend of 3 years and graduating from university gave me the same visceral reaction because I wasn’t really experiencing my emotions anymore, the good or the bad. This all came to a head last year when my grandma passed away. I decided to get high before her funeral (as I did every morning by this point) and I couldn’t express any emotion, I wouldn’t even let out a single tear.

That’s when I realized how withdrawn I had become with everything; my family, my friends, my interests. I realized then that my relationship was problematic on so many levels and that it was time to pull back. I did what maybe a lot of people here did first, created rules for myself. ‘I’ll only smoke on the weekends’, ‘I’ll only drink with friends’, or what turned to be my favourite rule to break ‘I won’t get high before work.’ These rules would last for a week or two at the most and I would slide back into my original ways because we are creatures of habit and I had spent a decade reinforcing enforcing those habits and behaviours into my life. 

These past couple months I decided to start opening up to my family, my friends and most importantly my girlfriend about my substance abuse. I had gotten so good at hiding everything from them for so long that these were tough conversations to have, but it started to create a team in my corner, it wasn’t just me dealing with my shit on my own anymore. What a feeling not having to hide things from the people you love. 

On March 28th I woke up , went for a walk and decided even with all the chaos going on around us right now that I was done with substance use for good. I am still learning that change is a lot harder than we sometimes anticipate it to be , but that it is also never too late to be the person you want to be (credit: Bojack Horseman) . This last month has had its up and downs, but I am staying present, learning to accept the imperfections and not looking for any outs. 

I am happier now than I was for all those years, but also sometimes I am sadder. I’m sad about my grandma, sad about moments or things I missed out on because I was getting drunk or high. But I am thankful that I get to experience it all again because really that’s what the human experience is all about. It’s experiencing the good and the bad, the sad and the happy, the stressful and the peaceful, the joy and the pain. I am finding out that one can’t really exist without the other. 

Pheeww pretty long winded for a 1 month post, but I have been coming to this group daily since my Day 1 and being part of this community has helped in ways that I can’t really explain,  I felt like I finally needed to share something my self. 

Love to everyone out there and stay safe wherever you are during this time ❤️",41,0

I was a heavy drinker since about 17. I kept it together until about 30 or so, when I became a real alcoholic and was drinking about 24/7. At my wit's end I went to see a psychiatrist and that's when doo doo really hit the fan. One way or another I got ""stuck"" on SSRI and benzos. Eventually years later I quit. I'm struggling, but feeling so much better than I have when I was constantly under the influence. I've had years and months sober, I love and know that freedom. I'm 41 now.

However, I always had marijuana in my life. It's the one substance that kinda keeps me away from alcoholism and other drugs, but there are times when I feel like I am constantly high. To me it's a lesser evil.

I'd love to quit for good, but I relapse after being completely sober. If not weed, I'd be in a much worse place. Honestly conflicted. As a multi substance abuser I feel like mj for me is like coffee to many. But I know deep down inside that it's not doing me any favors.

Last time I smoked nugs, so as my tolerance reached its pinnacle, my house filled with smoke and I sought out more powerful nugs. The addiction reached an unmaintainable critical mass.

This time I'm quitting carts. It's not *easier*, but _different_. 

Now I have no specific addiction to smoking, since there's no smoke. My carts are odorless and flavorless. They taste terrible. So why aren't they easier to quit?

For me, carts have the problem of immediate gratification. Being addicted to them has been a perpetual high rather than the up and down of smoking. I can stick one in my pocket and duck into any bathroom for a fix. That alone makes them just as difficult to come off as proper weed.

Where I live, the only advantage weed had was cost. I paid $100 for a cart, and it lasted five days.

So now I'm a week in, without any benefit from having been doing carts. In my opinion, carts are no better, and no easier to quit, than actual weed.",8,0

They are just so vivid, strange and complex beyond comprehension. Most of the time they are neutral or slightly negative, but a few times i had such twisted nightmares that I got traumatized, which led me into smoking again just to silence the night terrors. 

On the other hand, my most beautiful and astonishing dream happened when I stopped smoking a few months ago. It was a breaktrough DMT trip that looked, sounded, and felt just like the real thing. 

Sadly, I have never got to the point where the dreams would stop being so erratic, and return to baseline.

I have met so many people through a mutual love for smoking cannabis. Whether its getting together for a social smoke and chill, pulling out a J at a show or hanging out in the back room at a party, I have always seen that the ADVANTAGE of weed is that it increases one's social circle.

However, where this goes wrong is in moving the relationships you build forward. People end up smoking you down, throwing more weed than you without saying anything, giving you numbers for dealers, buying the blunts, rolling the blunts, giving you value that is lopsided. Or its the opposite and you are the one doing extra. If you try to hang out with the person without smoking (""Let's not smoke today, let's do this instead), you are suggesting that the value difference will not be made up in the future. You have already cemented yourself in the ""weed smoking friend"" box.

Use your conversation skills, problem solving ability, comedic insight, creative capacity, philosophical perception or any other value you can offer by your mere presence to build fair relationships. There will still need to be balance, yet it is not in terms of money. You will become confident so that you do not need to share a J to build a friendship with someone.

80,2020-04-28 15:06:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g9tccs/day_5_of_no_smoking/,Day 5 of No Smoking,"I recently quit ALL drugs 5 days ago for Ramadan after almost a decade of 24/7 smoking. I've always been scared of how dramatic the change would be (like if I'll be able to sleep, how bored I'll be, how left out I'll feel when seeing others smoke, etc.) and I just wanted to share with you guys my very honest experience these past 5 days. 

Day 1: Sleep was very difficult and I ended up sleeping at 5 AM. Woke up with a massive headache, so i kept going back to sleep till it was gone. Didn't get out of bed till 1 PM. Exercising was also extremely difficult as I could only jog/run 2 miles over 30 minutes. I was also bored out of my mind and it was very apparent that video games/Netflix alone was not enough to grab my attention. I also had to clean out my bong and move it to a barely accessible shelf so that temptation was not easy to give in. Sad to admit I spent probably 30 minutes smelling my remaining weed and debating whether I should just quit tomorrow. Toughed out the day, but it was brutal. 

Day 2: Slept again around 4 AM. Woke up with a slight headache. Housemate forced me to go on a 7-mile run with him to the Golden Gate Bridge; I got lost coming back, but I think that was the best part because I truly enjoyed the rush of being lost and having to find my way back (left my phone, wallet and keys at home). For those two hours, I absolutely did not think about smoking at all which is surprising because I used to bring my vapes with me on runs. The two hours after I got back, I also did not think about smoking. This was probably due to a mix of runner's high and my body's shock at how much exercise I forced it to do. I then cooked a heavy dinner and food coma'd out at 9 PM. 

Day 3: Woke up bright and early and chugged coffee to prevent me from going back to sleep. Also helped with my headache. Tossed a Frisbee around at the park for a couple of hours and then played Fortnite till dinner time. Thought about smoking while playing Fortnite because I'm so used to hitting my dab pen in the lobby. Countered this by just running around in circles for the duration of the lobbies. Also noticed I was getting a lot more wins than I usually do. Ate another heavy dinner and slept at 12. 

Day 4: Woke up with the slighest of headaches, but was otherwise very energetic right from the get-go. Also should note that I woke up naturally at 7 AM which is crazy cause I usually wake up around 11:30 earliest naturally. This is the day I probably stopped having the sudden, intense urges to smoke and the usual triggers (which includes everything from cooking to waking up to taking a shower to literally any chore I do) were easy to say no to. Did some weightlifting while attending online class and I was pretty attentive at both. This is also the day I noticed I was way more focused. My memory was also getting a lil better (meaning in conversations, I'm able to remember what they said earlier in the day and sorta tie it to what they're saying now). Long-term memory is still pretty shot. Sadly, I wasn't able to sleep as easily as the other two days, but I ended up jerking myself to sleep at a reasonable time of 3 AM. 

Day 5: Woke up with zero headache. Forced myself to get out of bed today at 7 and I chugged coffee I had prepared for myself the night before. Been productive since. Attended a work Zoom meeting and I can definitely notice not only how much more focused I was, but also how much more information I was able to digest. Was capable of not only following along, but think critically of it. I've filled out my calendar for May and packed it with a unique activity almost every day. Can truthfully say I am excited to see how I hold up. I think it should be smooth sailing from here in terms of craving, but the key is to keep abstaining and not giving in because I think I am no longer addicted (because that usually ends in me becoming addicted again haha).

1) Light sensitivity. when I smoke, wind and light makes my eyes burn and water. after a few days of not, they seem to return to normal.

2) Stomach cramps. sometimes when on a multi day binge, I would start to experience painful stomach cramping, that would last all day. They were so debilitating that the only thing that helped until they passed was curling in a ball in  a warm shower for hours.

3) Teeth degeneration. from the smoke being pushed through, gums get really upset. lack of motivation led to lsck of brushing led to mouth of pain.

4) Hemorrhoids. I would smoke so much, and cough so much, that i would constantly give myself painful, and disgusting piles, that would take weeks to go away, because i would keep smoking, and causing strain.

5) Weight loss. I'm 5'11, 107 lbs. I've never weighed more than 125, and I'm okay with that, But I've gone down to ~75 through binging for months, and being too weak to even make a meal, let alone eat one.

Besides a three month break I managed two years ago, I've been a daily smoker for about six years. To me, pot was  equivalent to food; there was breakfast, lunch, dinner and usually a  midnight snack. Today is day one (again) for me. I had a mental breakdown  yesterday and came to the realization that I'm depressed. For a long  time, I was masking my mental health issues with a n y t h i n g -  alcohol, food, sex, drugs etc. I thought I found a friend in cannabis.  Not only did it make me feel better, it never ever made me feel bad.  Until I tried to stop two years ago.   
I'm really tired of the people  in my life thinking that the withdrawal isn't real or severe. Even in my  research online, I found information relating THC withdrawal as similar  to a coffee drinker quitting cold turkey. As a daily coffee drinker I  have to call out major BS on that, at least in my experience. If I miss  my morning coffee, I will have a headache by mid-afternoon. If I drink  enough water, maybe take an Advil, I'll start to feel better. I might be  a bit cranky but by the next day, I won't really have anymore caffeine  withdrawal symptoms. Weed? Totally different story. I missed my habitual  bowl this morning and BAM like clockwork, I'm sweating out of every  possible orifice within the hour. I'm having hot flashes, cold sweats,  fluttering heart, shakiness and even though my stomach is physically  begging me to eat, just the thought of food makes me nausea. Personally I would  take a little caffeine headache over this crap any day.   
I'm doing this  for my sanity but still hoping that I'll be able to have a casual,  healthy relationship with this favourite poison of mine someday. I just finally realized that it doesn't have the same euphoric, stimulating effect  anymore. It merely gets me through the day now, something I no longer  even enjoy.

I am personally 20mos sober from alcohol, as I am an alcoholic (in remission as my doc likes to day)as well, you'd think I would have seen this coming, well, in a way I did, but I never realized how bad it was going to get before making the decision to stop.

This is coming from someone who was addicted to bong rips with weed and tobacco for 4 years, and who smoked weed for 13 years. 

How I finally quit: 
  I lived with my ex who also smoked in the same manner, and did not want to quit. Hiding the bong didn’t work. As long as he was smoking around me and there was weed around I was unable to give it up. I remember scraping crumbs off the carpet and everything around the area we smoked in, and resorting to resin once I smoked all the crumbs I could find. I felt hopeless and like I would never be able to quit. It seriously takes a toll on your self esteem to feel out of control and completely dependent. Eventually we broke up due to unrelated reasons and I moved into a house with no bongs or bowls. 

   Admittedly, I drank like a fish for awhile. I got a job in a small office space where it wasn’t as acceptable to come in hungover and smelling like stale booze so that helped me slow down with the alcohol. I was never a big drinker before though, so eventually the nights where I got emotional drunk and waking up feeling like shit got old and I switched to a glass of wine a night and eventually an occasional drink. I don’t recommend replacing one crutch with another, but I have to be fully honest with my experience. 

My number one take away is that if it’s around you, it’s a 1000 times harder to quit. Smash your bong, delete your plugs number, take a hiatus from friends that smoke (now would be the ideal time). Find another crutch, hopefully not alcohol like me. I know when you’re having a withdrawal the last thing you want to do is exercise or yoga or anything that requires any energy. Watch an addicting tv show to pass the time if that’s the case. Snack when you get a craving or take a shower. Even if you get a little chunky it’s better than being stuck in a haze for the rest of your life. 

Your anxiety might peak but will eventually chill out, I recommend making a list of things to do when you feel anxious. Guided meditations on YouTube helped me and you’ll find some oddly specific ones for just about any situations. You’ll start to do other activities that seemed overwhelming before. You’ll be a better friend, you’ll give your dog the walks they were missing out on because you didn’t want to leave the house, you’ll feel more comfortable making decisions and taking action to make other changes in your life. You’ll be able to address tasks that seemed insurmountable before. Social anxiety actually lessens despite the fact you might believe weed helps with that right now. Thoughts of self doubt do as well. 

Yes, I still experience anxiety, depression, and stress like all humans, but when those feelings set in I don’t feel hopeless. I have confidence that I’ll overcome them and it actually feels good not being numb because I take initiative to make changes. I do better in school and at work and I actually feel proud of myself. The thought of even being high makes me uncomfortable now because I feel so much more in control of my life and I never want to relinquish that again. The thought of smoking and feeling stuck to the couch or unmotivated is worse than being sober and facing difficult emotions. When it’s been long enough to look back and put how you felt when you were high in perspective you won’t miss it at all. If the most you can do right now is have hope that you will quit, hold on to that and be proud you have that much; it’s the first step to regaining your independence and confidence in your ability to navigate through life without an addiction or crutch. It’s a better feeling than any high from weed you’ve ever had.",5,0

I hate the cycle, I want out of the cycle, I don’t want to go back. The addiction is draining and exhausting, it makes me resent and loathe myself. Getting the F out of the cycle is the decision I’ve made and I’m sticking to it - I ain’t going back! If I fall again I will get right back up like I have the last 7 days.

When I remember how much I despise the cycle and the insanity that comes with it, all I can think is a headache, being sweaty, and staying up too late reading reddit posts is fucking worth it.

103,2020-04-28 01:29:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g9haxu/severe_withdrawal/,Severe Withdrawal,"Okay so i’m going to start off by saying that I am an 18 year old female and I’ve smoked like 4-6 times a day for about a year now. While herb was my main go to I would shake it up with edibles (don’t ever eat 500mg thinking you’re a god, because you aren’t and it will kick your ass), wax (dabs), and I had a cart. I don’t have a big knack for alcohol and zero interest or experimentation with harder drugs (save a time or two with coke at party or shrooms). Two weeks ago I got pretty viscously ill. All my symptoms at the time pointed to the severe flu. I’m starting to feel a little better after being sick for about four days (no weed during this time) and then 4/20 rolls around. Self control was nonexistent for me as 4/20 turned into a 3 day event where I was thoroughly fucked up with my girls. After the third day we cool it and I am having severe nausea and vomiting. I’m super confused at this point as I rarely have negative reactions to marijuana save the occasional nausea or munchies. I assumed I somehow got a flu like illness once again. I decide that during this time it would be a good time to try and quit or at least take a giant tolerance break because the effects of weed on a girls bank account became absolutely ridiculous. I’m a waitress so I’m also out of work for the most part until this COVID lockdown lifts. 

A week following the last time I smoked has been the worst of my life. I have lost 10-15 pounds from the complete inability to stomach or keep food down (it actually repulses me rn). I had horrendous night sweats and chills constantly. The nausea was probably the worst part, right?

I was largely mistaken. 

The last three days I have had almost completely debilitating anxiety and panic attacks. I’ve never had a panic attack in my life until recent events and let me tell you it is not fun. I was fully convinced I was having a heart attack and went to the ER. My blood pressure was 200/100 ( I am almost always at 122/80 ), and a pulse of 140-150. The hospital just did standard procedures (lab, EKG, covid test), all came back good and indicating i’m perfectly healthy. Got fluids for dehydration and a pat on the back. They told me that they were fully convinced all of this was related to a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, which is basically a really bad reaction to marijuana that causes severe nausea, vomiting, and all the jazz. As I am writing this post, exactly a week from when I stopped, I am beginning to feel a fragment of better which is a huge step from the complete nightmare this past week has been. 

So yes I have just written a book about marijuana withdrawals, but I thought I would put this out there so people going through similar circumstances know they aren’t alone. Don’t be afraid, put down the blood pressure cuff, and stop taking your pulse (unless medically needed). The symptoms regarding withdrawal are really stigmatized and it is believed that the most you’ll get from quitting is insomnia and some vivid dreams. I have had both of these symptoms, but also much much worse. It is not fun. And as I have all of this excruciating freetime being unemployed for the time being and stuck without a mental crutch to smoke, I have begun to realize just how destructive my dependence on weed was to my mental health. Do I still love pot? Absolutely. I’ve had some of the most fun of my life, and the most spiritual connections with people while smoking. I’m in no way judging anyone, I actually envy you for not having these symptoms. But for whoever is going through a similar situation, it gets better. It took me 7 days to realize that after googling every illness and symptom known to man to try and figure out what is going on with my body. I wish I had someone to reassure me or a post like this to ease my mind. 

Withdrawal is real, and just because you personally don’t experience it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Everyone’s experiences will differ, whether this be psychologically or physically. I used weed as a crutch to not have to take antidepressants and keep my mood up. Happy customers, happy tips.    

This experience has taught me just how hazed and cloudy my judgement and moods were while smoking so frequently and without restraint. Even though I feel like absolute shit right now, I have already seen improvements with my optimism, motivation, and personal relationships. So to anyone who is going through the ongoing struggle of a tolerance break, quitting (and staying that way), or having mere curiosity, just know that your pain and experiences are validated. You do not need and justification for how you feel or how your body reacts to substances. You are brave and can endure this journey if you center yourself.

I smoked everyday for about 8 years starting as a sophomore in highschool. I struggled so hard to keep a balance in my life of smoking in moderation during that time. I strived to live every waking second being stoned and every time I tried to quit prior to my DUI, I failed miserably. I just loved it so fucking much. I couldn't even go on a trip for a day without bringing something to be able to get high. Well, I quit for a whole year, missing it every single day. I would count every day I was sober. Looking back on my reddit posts in this group, I can't even believe that I felt like that because it is so different than how I feel now. I had a lot of things happen during that year that eventually led me to say fuck it and go back to smoking. I went from not smoking at all to smoking everyday again.

But let me tell you, it was never the same. I thought it was going to be just as great as when I left it. It wasn't. I'm a person that has 0 self control with anything that I really enjoy. I smoked from this past June essentially everyday until about 2 months ago (about 8 months). It would make me feel like shit for the first 30-40 minutes after smoking and then I would feel ""ok"" and somewhat enjoy it. I would only smoke at night because I actually couldn't feel normal being high in public anymore (something I used to regularly). I felt like I was smoking everyday during those 8 months because it was the only ""normal"" I had ever known especially after I spent all this time missing it so fucking much during that year. I would get in my own head and waves of anxiety would hit me, especially immediately after I would smoke. It just made me think - ""why the fuck am I doing this if I don't enjoy it"". So now I have a whole bunch of weed and carts leftover just sitting in my room that I refuse to touch. I would've never thought I could have the self control to do that. Every time I tried to quit I had to throw literally everything away to not be tempted. I don't know if my brain is just fucked up now from all the years of chronic use or I'm just growing up. This shit used to define who I was and now I don't even like it. I honestly have no idea why I'm writing this. It's definitely more for myself so I can reflect on this later. But maybe it can give someone some motivation that if you quit for long enough, you can come back and try it and just isn't appealing to you anymore. I truly never thought that would happen to me but here I am. I knew it was bad for me, so maybe this is a blessing in disguise, but man I wish I could enjoy it like I used to. Anyway, good luck on your abstinence from weed everybody, I just thought I would share my my thoughts while I reflect on my drug addiction that has turned into a very strange relationship with a substance that I may never fully understand.",3,0

I hope you are all finding success in regards to quitting marijuana use. But I am going to stray off topic. I just finished reading ‘Streets of Laredo’, the sequel too ‘Lonesome Dove’ both written by Larry McMurty. While the series is not related to sobriety whatsoever, it very much is related to my sobriety which I would like to share with you all. When I was 14 I was sent to inpatient treatment. It was terrifying, confusing, angering among other things. And it strained the relationship between my parents and I so much that for a time neither of reconciliation. I had my 15th birthday while I was inside. that day my parents came too visit; while there, my dad gifted a copy of ‘Lonesome Dove’ his favorite Novel of all time. I never considered my dad as a reader, and I never considered I would open the book up myself. I did. I made it halfway. And then I got released from the treatment center and my reading habit went down the drain. Fast forward 2 years later (almost 3). I’m a senior in high school. Our graduation is cancelled, ball dance postponed indefinitely, and the future is very terrifying, confusing, and angering. Yet, through all this chaos, I’ve found myself with a generous amount of time to spend on new hobbies. A month and a half ago I picked up Lonesome Dove for the second time. And 15 minutes ago I finished Streets of Laredo. These books have brought me to a closer understanding of myself, and it’s left me with questions I have yet to answer. It is a romance of more ways than one. Intimate love, the love of a brother, the love of a friend, the love of an enemy. It is a deep, raw, and unapologetic. And I would never have opened the book if it weren’t for the decision to quit smoking. I probably won’t do anything for the remainder of the night. I imagine I’ll finish this and spend the rest of my conscious hours pondering my past, present and future. Thank you Larry McMurty for writing such a gift. Bless you all. Night.",3,0

I feel like my brain is wiser, more creative, more ambitious when high. Talking to people is easier and I stop stuttering! I also become more focused.

The problem is, I have a very demanding day job that requires a lot of thinking and solid communication. I feel like sober me is becoming slower and less intelligent because of the effects of weed.. but I have no substantial evidence for it. I just figure that weed must have lasting effects on your brain.. I feel like I’m stuttering a lot more now when I’m sober and it’s really making me second guess myself since communication is so important in my job.

The water leaked into the bottom apartment and basically ruined their entire complex. Its going to cost $10,000 to fix and will likely come out of some of my investment savings. I NEVER would have done this sober, but I was depressed, drunk and stoned all at once, a lethal combination.

I realize that I've been a passive bystander in my life for FAR too long, letting drugs control my actions  (not to mention everything else). I can't take it anymore, and I don't care what happens to me, I'M STAYING CLEAN FROM NOW ON. I used to think that drugs made life easier and better because I was not a recreational user after the first year anymore, but an addict in total denial for the next nine horrible years. Now I see that their abuse does the EXACT opposite. Maybe this was the kick in the ass I needed to get my life together.",14,0

I actually feel so irritable that my head is spinning and all I want to do is argue. At the same time I feel like
crying my eyes out while oddly feeling okay. I feel restless and I can’t focus at work or in class. It’s better than being depressed and suicidal. 

I told my instructor today that I need until Wednesday to decide if I’m dropping out. I’m in a medical coding course and  I don’t think I’m cut out for it. It’s boring, but I thought it would be good for my mental well being. I work in medical billing now and it’s boring but bearable. I thankfully don’t work in the public. 

I’m not sure I want to be sober like this. I mean I feel okay, but something tells me I may not be. I need my mind and body to slow down, which pot helped with. It made life worth living in some ways. I’m not sure I can handle another suicidal depression. I won’t get high because I know it exasperates how I feel already. I dread the day I go back into another suicidal depression. It’s always at bay, waiting to come out.

Unfortunately, ever since I started again (relapsed) I went back to max debauchery. It shamed me daily. I holed up. Gained weight. Affected my new relationship. 

Today, I’m 7 days into my new full blown sobriety. I won’t be going back if it’s up to me. In this instance, weed is not my friend. It’s an ex that I’ve just finally come to fully realize I never will have a positive future with.

Weed has always made me anxious in social situations, but recently even when smoking alone I get so much anxiety. It's taking a toll on my mental health to be honest. 

I want to quit ASAP, this community seems like the only place where I will be heard and honestly I'm just crying out for help. My best friends live very close to me and we smoke every day. These are people who genuinely care for me and weed doesn't necesarily make our friendship if that makes sense.

Take the party hats off a sec I have a rant a coming...

Haven't had one in aaaages...

Day 75 wow. Okay. Didn't think I'd see this day. Not at all.

Started this journey in the gutter. Kinda helped, only way is up right?

The first weeks fucking sucked (hello sober mind that can remember EVERYTHING) but as I picked myself up out of the gutter and brushed myself off I actually felt amazing. Seriously, really fucking good.

I'd also identified the bad guy in the story of my life. Weed. And I had a reason. A battle to win. Cool.

But life 🤷🏼‍♀️ Covid 19 🤷🏼‍♀️ me 🙄

Day 60 or so hit and the wheels came off. It came back. The urge. The want. So I accepted my fate. Accepted I'd give in. Sat with that thought. Let it control me.

*Big side note: not everyone is the same. Some people get addicted and ruin their lives, some people get addicted BECAUSE their lives are ruined. I'm in the latter half. That clarity and being able to remember and relive everything is back to keeping me awake at night. This won't be the case for everyone. Some people will get free and be FREE. For some it's only the beginning.*

Back to it... Realising the bad guy in your story is actually YOU is actually quite liberating if you let it be. Weed was never my problem. It was just an outlet. I'M the problem.

The hope is, that by sitting with it, allowing the anger it's turn again, that the next 25 days will be easier than the last 15. Can't be much worse. Well... 

Nah. I'm not giving myself anymore sticks to beat myself with. I shall not smoke today.

I'm angry but that's okay.

Now about that party?

I am on day 59 which is a new record and my third serious attempt at chucking this 16 year habit. 

I decided to take a break from rleaves for a while for this attempt as I found myself fixating on it more due to my constant flicking through posts on here. 

Have been ghosting on here for the last couple of weeks humming and hawing if I should re-engage the community. Without the initial support from the people on here I would never have got to where I am, the success and relapse stories motivated me to keep trying, so thank you all. 

Hope everyone is doing well and working through these challenging times in their own ways. I for one am just trying to keep on trucking but the temptations are becoming overwhelming at the moment as boredom has set in and managing the day to day with a 21 month old has been testing my resolve. 

The only thing keeping me from folding at the moment is the thought of going back to day 1. I had hoped that it would get progressively easier but definitely not out of the woods yet as I seems to comes in waves of motivation and demotivation about what I am trying to achieve. 

My god the dreams have started in the last couple of weeks and they are bizarre, intense and vivid.

My weekends are a lot more interesting,"Today is four months clean for me, the longest I've been sober since high school almost 20 years ago. Aside from some wine for a recent holiday I've been sober from alcohol as well.

When I was using every day, often multiple times per day, the weekends for me were an obstacle course of getting high while meeting the bare minimum family obligations. Wake up, hit the pen in the bathroom. Have breakfast with wife and preschooler, mostly zoned out. Hang out on the couch, maybe play some games or read with daughter. Sneak off and get high. Make lunch, put the kid down for a nap--get high. Etc. Saturday and Sunday every weekend. I hated doing anything complex or even leaving the house because it added to the difficulty of staying high all weekend.

That's gone now. I do not think about getting high during the day at all anymore. Ironically the pandemic has us locked down same as most people, so we aren't taking lots of trips. But I do complex activities and take walks with the family, I started a vegetable garden and my daughter is helping me tend it, we practice musical instruments together and we're making a set list to do a concert for our family over zoom. My days are a lot more full and I'm excited for the pandemic to lift so I can see what else I'm capable of.

My mood seems to be fully regulated now. I don't experience frequent waves of anger or sadness like I did at first. Every day I'm a little more able to control my emotions and choose how to react to thinks. The other day I was getting out a box of legos to play with and I dropped it and sent them scattering everywhere. That could have sent me into a spiral when I was still getting high or in my first months of recovery. I just joked about it and moved on. I haven't had an emotional meltdown in probably a month and a half.

I do still think about weed in the evenings sometimes. I've realized that what I miss is the idealized experience of it I have in my head, though -- not the reality. I miss the idea of a harmless substance that can magically unlock deep wells of meaning and joy and poetry in a life that is otherwise mundane. But that's not weed. Weed's the thing that shuts me down emotionally, distracts me and causes obsessive thoughts, and makes me see life as mundane when really, life is all there is. I feel more certain every day I won't go back.

Side note, those glasses of wine....wow. I knew when I quit weed that I'd better drop alcohol too and I see that it could be a dangerous temptation for me. There's effort involved in finding contentment and equilibrium while sober. Weed and alcohol offer a temporary, illusory shortcut to that sense of contentment that allowed me to stop trying. It was the release of not trying that really called to me, I think, and that's what I felt when I had that wine. In that one sense, I'm grateful to the quarantine. Obtaining alcohol is enough of a pain in the ass that it's easy to say 'nope, no way.'",11,3

I know that I should quit. It's keeping me down, it's preventing me from cooking at home, causing me to eat more junk food, and preventing me from getting my house into better order. And it's muffling my ability to make meaningful forward progress on major life issues.

But I don't *want* to quit. I love my evenings with pot. I like the relaxation, I like listening to records while high. I like smoking on long drives to deal with stress of Bay Area traffic. I'm lonely and isolated, and it gives me a warm place to cuddle up and feel comfortable.

I've set my sights on quitting ""sometime soon"", but I don't know how I would approach the process. While it is one of the major things holding me back, it is also propping me up by helping cope with depression and stress.

I found this sub, and have been considering writing this post for a couple of weeks. I'm not sure what I'm looking for; I wanted to put my thoughts out there to the community. Maybe the act of writing this will be helpful.

I've followed this community for what feels like forever now. I have tried and told myself I'd quit far too many times to ever count. The number of journal entries I have stating ""this is it!"" is embarrassing, and I really lost faith in myself and my ability to turn things around.

I was the smart girl who had her shit together until I started smoking around the age of 20. Fast forward 10 years: it had stopped being fun a long time ago. It was now serving another purpose, which was masking the ugly, painful feelings that simmered under the surface. I knew I was letting my life waste away, and I couldn't deal with it. I smoked constantly, about 1/8 a day, waking up every few hours throughout the night to smoke 3-4 bowls just so I could fall back asleep. 

I wasn't even living. I was numbing & blocking out not only the negative feelings, but EVERYTHING. Nothing felt good or brought me joy anymore. I stopped writing, making art, reading books etc. and started to become a recluse. I didn't even know who I was anymore.

Eventually the weed just wasn't doing enough for me. I started drinking more. Or I would tell myself I wouldn't smoke weed, just to get drunk and order a weed delivery a few hours later. In those moments, it felt like the only way I could cope with my own existence. 

But here I am. I haven't had weed or alcohol in a week and I'm almost in disbelief. Just wanted to share this win with a community that has helped me to feel like I'm not alone in this.

You aren't alone in this either. None of us are. Like they say over at r/stopdrinking, I will not smoke with you today.",523,1

https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g89jq3/day_3_starts_now/

I've never been a big fan of extra exercise. Sure, I'll do the 7 min workout, or a variation... but I consider that upkeep. However, I've been biking instead of driving the last couple of days, and it feels amazing.

I mean... at the time its pure hell, lungs screaming, gagging on phlegm, ears crying out in pain, gums aching... it feels like it will never end... and in that pain... the destination seems unreachable... you want to stop riding, curl up and die.

But then... you make it to your destination, and that agony starts to subside. Then... not only do you no longer feel agony... you feel good.

Im not one for sports analogies, The only thing I really know is *""insert some joke about the raptors being the worst nfl team""*, yet... I find this a suiting analogy from my experience with addiction. Its just another hellish bikeride.

I've found that talking to others here about their circumstances, successes, and failures, helps me reflect on my own.. But i worry a bit... Though Ive only been here 2 days, I fear this might become a bit of an obsession, an addiction in itself... 

Sure... it feels genuinely amazing to offer support to others, while receiving support yourself, BUT... if offering addiction support to leavers becomes my life... Wouldn't that mean that pot still controls it?

Then... there are craving strossors... While I understand that everyone is genuinely trying to be helpful... I cant help but find some things people say to be incredibly triggering, and could lead to instant relapse on my part, if I cant filter them, or get them out of my head... which has led to me making borderline agressive comments, which in themselves may be triggering to others.

Ah well. The only easy day was yesterday.

Then when my longest break ever got to an end I bought a gram and smoked it within 24 hours (it wasn't very good weed). And you know what I did when I first got high?

Break your Bad Habits with Mindfulness and Positive Practices that release Serotonin.,"I guess smoking everyday eventually becomes a habit and habits are hard to break once formed. Especially the expedient ones. And boy is weed fucking expedient! Habits work in a queue...action...reward manner. And since we smoke up everyday, even the mundane daily things trigger us to smoke. ""Is it raining? Man a puff would be so goooood!."" ""I'm bored and I should probably rub one off! I wish I was high first though, its incredible when I'm high."" ""Oh ya I have an ice cream in the fridge! it tastes infinitely better after a puff though!""

Mindfulness:

You must be aware that after you get past your physical withdrawal there will still be cravings triggered by daily queues. In order to break a habit you gotta be mindful and identify those queues that triggers your cravings. Check what are your queues and affirm yourself that you're good sober during that situation. Once you stop feeding that monster on a consistent basis, the queues will eventually fade simultaneously reducing your cravings. And for this the app ""Grounded"" has helped me very much. It has helped me keep track of the amount of money I saved and the bowls I didn't smoke, check in on my cravings and how I feel for the day. When you see that $$ sign that you saved not smoking weed, you will definitely get that small hit of dopamine too (it helps). The creators of the app are doing God's work.

Also be aware of your physical withdrawals and mental state. Are you losing focus while you try to do work? are you feeling excessively sweaty and has your body odor deteriorated because of it? are you able to sleep? Identify the thoughts that give you anxiety and make peace with it. Be aware of yourself and your physical needs. Treat yourself and take care of yourself like someone you truly care about!  You'll be able to face your future with better clarity when you are sober. NOT WHEN YOU ARE HIGH.

Activities that trigger gradual release of Serotonin:

1) Exercise.

 I have always been a fitness enthusiast (strength training) but I noticed that I spiraled into depression and anxiety once I had stopped working out over 3 months due to a stressful work environment to which I was coping smoking a loooot of weed. My depression only got worse. I soon realized that it was because I did not get that daily dose of serotonin which I would get on a regular basis when I was working out. I truly believe that fitness and well-being goes far beyond than just increasing your longevity and staying healthy without illness. It boosts your mental state, increases confidence and helps you achieve new goals which you would not have been able to if you were still lazing around.

2) Progressing towards your Goals

We are not the happiest once we achieve something. We are at the happiest when we  are actually moving and progressing towards our goal. For instance, you graduate, yeah cool and all but now you are at the verge of unemployment and now stressed on what to do on the next phase of your life. How about instead focusing on consistently scoring good marks each semester? You're getting that serotonin hit every time you see that grade which is a result of your hard work. 

But hey lets start with some small goals first. There are just some things in your life that screams for fixing. Minor things in life which require fixing that you aren't so sure will make a significant difference. For instance whats the state of your room? is it clean? well your new goal is to clean your room. Has the trash can not been taken out for the last one weeks? Now is the best time! Make small goals and achieve! Constantly think about what you're gonna do tomorrow instead of how you might end up in 3 years time.

3) Meditation

Man I saw the meditation post on this community on ""Top Posts"" and that alone will give you all the insights you need to know. Highly recommend you look into it now. Link below

[https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/85u18y/some\_notes\_and\_encouragement\_on\_meditation\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/85u18y/some_notes_and_encouragement_on_meditation_from/)

4) Diet

Our body is also like a car. If you're gonna put shitty engine oil , your engine is going bust. Period. See the engine oil as macronutrients and other fluids such as break fluids, battery water as micronutrients. Make sure you replenish your body with the adequate nutrients so you're functioning well. Take multivitamins, it substantially improves our sleep and daily function or if not eat lots of fruits and veggies to supplement you with the necessary vitamins you need. Eat nuts, berries, Grade A eggs and some good quality meat! Take care of yourself like someone you truly care about who is capable of adding value to the people around you.

Today is my 4th day sober and I'm as motivated than ever to quit smoking weed and thanks to this beautiful community of people! I have tried quitting weed before numerous times and I always found myself relapsing every time giving into my cravings. The difference between now and then is that before I always wanted weed as part of my life. Perhaps moderate my use but I just never could. Not until i found this community that I  understood the tremendous success people see when they quit completely. 3 days ago I went completely broke and had no money to buy weed. The physical withdrawals kicked in. My body temperature got high, vigorous sweating, bad body odour, restlessness and sleeplessness. Anxiety on my future and existential crisis loomed over me while childhood traumas and failures would further deteriorate my mood and mental aptitude. I just wanted help at this point and Whoosh! I came across this page and I understood that I need to stop weed altogether or at least until I'm in a place where I can go about my daily routine without any queues or thought whatsoever!

Another obvious move is getting back into hobbies, including things I've wanted to do for a while. Maybe starting dating again (even that went down the crapper in the past year).

Everything you read about the first few days is true. It’s hard to stop. You seem to be always be in a funk or easily agitated. You can’t stop thinking about how great you felt like when you were high or even why you stopped smoking. Your anxiety is through the roof and you think to yourself. “One bowl or even one hit will make it all go away.” You can’t sleep, your Insomnia sucks, everything just sucks. But stick through it. Remember why you are doing this. 

Yesterday was a huge reminder for myself. 

Day 9: Me, my cousin and our mutual friend decide to go on a hike. Well our mutual friend doesn’t show up. We call him and text him but no answer. We were suppose to meet up at 8am we don’t hear from our buddy until about 3 pm. When we finally hear from him he tells us how he got super stoned and took some LSD so he over slept. It just reminds me how this “Wonderful” drug also made me unreliable. What if I was high and something happens to someone I care about and I can’t do anything but I’m stoned. 

But those days are passed me. 

But I do need some help. On about Day 7 i did start to dream again.. but it’s not dreams that I like, they are more like nightmares. It brings me up back to my abusive childhood and I also dream about a girl who I had a huge crush on but we sorta just stopped talking.

Let’s chat about the negative side effects that often get glossed over. Lets stay on the path and climb this mountain together:,"We’re in quarantine and it almost seems like this is the ideal time to smoke and get high. Why not. You have nothing else to do. But on the other hand, it’s the perfect time to quit. The idea that weed is harmless is a terrible narrative that often gets repeated without any merit. You can point to the famous daily smokers who seem to be “ok” but I think everyone here knows how easy it is to appear “ok” on the outside. Especially if you’re blasted off to Pluto and can’t even use your brain to process emotions. 

Quitting involves 2 things: self control & the desire to quit. It won’t happen without both. It’s real easy to look at people we know who smoke daily and seem to be doing great. And maybe they are. It hits everyone differently. But I know a lot of people who can “quit whenever they want” but turn extremely irritable and emotional when they have to take a break from it (for a job interview for example). Which points to a more likely conclusion that da weeeeed (Stephen A Smith reference, anyone?) has the power in that relationship. 

Most smokers agree that the first high is the best high of the day. After that, it’s a chasing game. You get couch locked, time flies by, you order food, play video games, and go to bed. All while taking smoke breaks between each step. It’s a great life because it’s stress free. It’s a call back to childhood where we can be temporarily devoid of responsibility. 

But at the same time, contrary to belief, I think weed actually makes anxiety and depression worse. It serves as a mask, which is why it is so difficult to quit and why people get really overwhelmed about little things while weening off. You feel great after the first few hits, but you never reach that same baseline again that day. And if this turns into daily smoking, you’re waking up with a “weed hangover” and intense mental fog. It’s scary how easy it is to get used to this fog. So to lift the fog and rebound anxiety, you smoke more and the cycle repeats. What used to make you feel happy af has now turned into something that makes you feel like shit. I’m sure you feel much less engaged in conversations as well, and people likely find you less interesting and fun to be around. 

Please understand these are not scientifically backed statements. Just anecdotes and observations.

I’d like to hear everyone’s experiences and what drove them to kicking the plant away and choosing a sober life with more clarity. Even when I was deep into it, I always had that feeling that I’m smoking for a reason. And it’s not just to feel good. At first it is, but then it becomes a remedy for a bad day at work. Or maybe it’s the highlight of the day when you can finally kick back and unwind. Before you know it, you spent a lot of money and wasted a lot of time without even realizing it. 

You guys have any weed friends? People that you lost touch with ever since you stopped smoking? Certainly makes quitting tougher but also puts into perspective which relationships we have that are meaningful. 

Do you have any hobbies that you would smoke before engaging it? It can be difficult to continue those hobbies without the habit of smoking prior to it. Maybe your favorite video games now piss you off instead of bringing you joy. 

Let’s keep walking down this path, step by step and one day at a time. No, one minute at a time. Let’s keep in mind all the shitty things about smoking weed. It’s not all fun and we know that, which is why it’s important for us to keep that in the forefront of our minds on a daily basis. We can use this mental clarity to reestablish ourselves, to truly find ourselves, and hone in on what’s important. Time is ticking, our family and parents are getting older. In 20 years, it would be so sad if we couldn’t remember our fond memories with our loved ones because we were too damn stoned to even engage with them on a meaningful level.

Let’s lean toward and INTO what scares us, instead of using weed to push it away..",7,2

&#x200B;

I'm currently 8 days sober, and MAN does it feel great. I started smoking in late 2016 on the weekends with two friends I had met at work. As the story usually goes, those weekends became every day once I moved out into my own apartment for the first time (March 2018). Two years later, and I have decided enough is enough.

&#x200B;

A week ago, I had a minor headache before bed. I did what I normally do and took two Excedrin. (EDIT: Two is the recommended dosage.)  Now, mind you, these were extra strength as the store was out of the generic. Within 45 minutes, my heart started racing 90 to nothing. This soon devolved into an all out anxiety attack (my very first ever). Due to this attack, I was not able to sleep at all that night. The following night was... rough to say the least. I couldn't catch my breath, my lungs ""felt"" clogged (paranoia)... it was all I could do NOT to have a smoke thinking that would allow myself to go to sleep. Luckily for me, I have a great familial support system, and after having talked it all out... I was able to finally go to sleep.

&#x200B;

That was all it took, though. I don't know why or how... but I was done. Even though I knew my lungs were fine (family member is a nurse who checked me out) and I was able to get to sleep... something inside my head just snapped and did a complete 180. As soon as I returned home the next day (I had gone to stay with family thinking the attack may last a while), I threw out the quarter I had left, I tossed my grinder in the dumpster... didn't look back or regret that decision. This past week, I was staying in the mountains with the grandparents. \*\*\* I have been self-quarantining since late Feb. as my job is extremely flexible and they have been isolated as well for the past two months... in the mountains 45 miles from the nearest city. \*\*\*

&#x200B;

I am now back home alone and continuing this journey solo! I canNOT wait to see what all great things are to come. I will say... the withdrawal symptoms have sucked. I haven't had anything horrific but vivid dreams and slight anxiety. The anxiety went away after the first two or three days, but the vivid dreams and insomnia are still sticking around. Reading through many posts and comments, I have full faith that these will be restored to normal soon, though.

Please forgive any grammar mistakes or rambling. My head is still a tad bit cloudy... which I've read will clear up with time. Good luck and stay sober, guys! Y'all can do it! ✌🏽❤️",3,0

Now, I give my power to it.","Hi guys, day 1 of quitting AGAIN. I have officially been smoking this stuff for ten years!! Of course, I've had periods where I quit and somewhat hate those sober times of my life because I can tend to be neglectful and abusive toward my innocent spirit who just wants to play and enjoy this time on earth. I don't want to give away the sense of joy and creative insight I get from being high and working. I love the work I do (chinese medicine), and weed sometimes aids my excitement about life and gives me a fresh perspective. 

But just as many of you know, if you smoke once a week you'll slip back to smoking 3 times a day. What am I constantly trying to escape from?! At first, weed gives me a sense of being a god, then I give my godly power away to it because I think to myself ""I can't be in love with reality as it is right now unless I'm high"" or ""this is too much for me I need to smoke"" This addiction is tricky. I LOVE WEED. like, too much. and it goes from friend to foe way too quickly. Literally, the entire 10 years of my relationship with weed has been love-hate. 

AHH! But I can't stand waking up every day to do the same shit and then feel bad about myself because I'm not being flexible in my approach to life. I keep trying to fit it into a monotonous box which then I hate and need to escape from by smoking weed. Like whoa! That's a real bind! Being flexible and adaptive isn't easy. Thank god for meditation, yoga, Tai qi, and laughter/fire dance. I need to take myself less seriously. Weed makes me think I am some kind of a magical thing. Which I am, but not alone. 

BTW if anyone is interested there is a great book about ""Marijuana Syndrome from the Chinese medicine perspective"". This guy has got it mapped out about how pot affects the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual body. The downside is that the book does shame pot users. Which isn't cool man we already have enough shame about ourselves!! Society is telling us what a problem we are and meanwhile, we are just doing the best we can with what's been offered by society. In any case, Please be strong my friends. You won't get different results from doing the same things. We have to try different things. You are what you believe about yourself to be.",15,0

177,2020-04-26 17:59:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g8nfu1/smoking_weed_is_like_powerlifting_being_sober_is/,"Smoking weed is like powerlifting, being sober is like a marathon","Think of a problem you face in life.

Now, if you are like I am, you smoke weed to combat said problem, in most cases some sort of psychological problem, be it stress, anxiety or depression. The way we handle these problems is by numbing our brain with THC and floating in bliss. For the time being, the problem is masked by a cloud of perceived marginality, but arises once more, if not stronger, when the cloud lifts. 

This is what I call the powerlifting method to problem solving. We use extremely potent substances to lift our ''sins'' of our backs. The problem is that, like a powerlifter, the method employs strength, and not endurance. After the lift is made, there is only a small grace period before the strength diminishes, and the problem falls back on our shoulders, heavier than before. 

This way of life is sustainable in the short term, but life does not stop when you are twenty. It keeps on going for much longer than that, and strength does not win in such conditions. With the culmulative effect of the method, the sins eventually become so big that not even the strongest powerlifter (substance) can lift it. 

This is where most of us start to question whether a new modus vivendi needs to be adopted. 

This is where we start to look for ways to quit using, and switch to a sober life. 

This is where we start running marathons. 

Solving problems while sober is a marathon. Now, you might be thinking, how is powerlifting easier than a marathon? Don't powerlifters also go through pain and achieve amazing feats of physical prowess? 

This is true, but hear me out. A powerlifter gets into position, does the lift, and puts the weight back down. The lift lasts maybe 20 seconds. He lifted an amazing amount of weight in a short period of time. A marathon runner cannot even fathom to lift a fraction of that in 20 seconds. What a marathon runner CAN do is run the equivalent of what the powerlifter managed to pull in 6,7,8 hours. They both do intense work, but the time it takes for the lifter to do the said lift is much shorter than the marathon runner needs to reach his distance. 

This is now the kicker. Powerlifter does his lift, and then carries on with his day. The lift makes him dizzy, but nothing he cannot handle. He will attempt a slightly heavier lift tomorrow, but he's good for today. 

The marathon runner takes a while to reach his mileage. Time is the biggest enemy of humans. Everything in the Universe took time to complete: from the Big Bang to yours trully took 13.7 billion years. It takes around 20 years of education to get a PhD. It takes planing and effort to achieve your goals. 

The runner gets bored during the run, starts questioning if it was really worth it, and if he should go back to powerlifting. Maybe marathon running isn't for him, he thinks. He does his mileage, and comes home exhausted,falling asleep instantly. 

The day after, he also does his mileage. This time, he nearly quit near the finish line. What is the point of running if it is as hard as powerlifting? If he does powerlifting, he thinks to himself, atleast he has a lot more of the day for himself. 

This continues for a week. Every time he is about to quit, the runner persists. Each time he makes the mileage, he comes home exhausted.

After some time, however, the runner notices that the mileage becomes way easier the more he does it. Every day he decides to run instead of lifting, he feels stronger. 

2 years have passed. The man now runs marathons regularly, and feels happier than ever. The pain is now accompanied by a feeling of being alive, of acceptance that this pain makes him stronger. 
The runner is no longer bored on runs, but enjoys looking at nature, and savours every breath he takes. He never thinks about powerlifting anymore, but questions himself on why did he do exercises which only became heavier with time. 


This is why I decided to start running marathons 32 days ago, and you can to. I trust in you to start running towards your goal. Take it one day at a time, friend, and when you finally reach you goal, know that I will be with you in my thoughts at the finish line, cheering you on like you deserve!",7,1

So as I was looking at the crumbs in the bottom of my jar thinking about smoking them on the way to my dealer I said fuck it. I just popped them into the ashtray and threw it out. First 2 days were terrible, was anxious all the time and I smoked about 20 cigarrettes, but I'm already feeling a bit better now. I know it will just keep getting better from here, so that helps with not looking back.

This can only be done effectively if you have a strong reason to why you choose not to smoke. For example my why is that smoking weed is pleasure that isn’t earned and would lead me to being ok with being bored and unfulfilled which would then cause me to feel worse when I am sober because I am not only damaging and slowing down my mind I am stopping my self from reaching my potential. 

To summarise first create a strong foundation in your mind as to why you don’t want to smoke. Then when the urge to smoke comes up during withdrawal and recovery refer to the why and let the thought pass by replacing it with another.

I’m 17 now close to turning 18 in the fall and feel like this life is too special to be sitting by myself high all the time. I started to realize i wasn’t as close with my family and didn’t have the same bond i did with them before i started smoking (even though i live with my family) and i started to realize i couldn’t control my emotions and thoughts on weed anymore. 

To backtrack about 5 days ago is when i first told myself i was done with weed after my anxiety and thoughts weren’t controllable anymore and i realized i would just smoke weed to cover up any emotions i had in life. not to mention how it makes you okay with being a piece of shit. 

so it’s now been 3 days sense i’ve quit and i stopped loosing weight and slowly getting my appetite back in the past couple days i have lost 15 pounds and have felt terrible. i really want to smoke but i do feel like i’ll be able to not smoke again due to how bad the anxiety made me feel and hopefully and i can get back on track with only a year wasted. 

it makes me sad to see a lot of people not realize they had a problem until so late. i look forward to turning to my old self and getting my social life back.

Prior to this virus I been battling an unhealthy and abusive relationship with weed. Smoking alone at night really had me down and out. I wanted to keep it to a social aspect with friends but I always found myself doing it alone at night and waking up with regret the next morning with no energy and regrets of over eating.

I came across some weed after the dispensaries got shut down. I live in Mass where it’s legal recreationally but our governor deemed it not essential. Me being stubborn saying how dare he take away something I like yet they leave alcohol still open (rather smoke than drink Personally) pissed me off.

Came across said weed, it was average, not great not terrible but I’ve come to realize that too much pleasure is pain. Smoking round the clock past month being in quarantine, I been eating Like a pig. Put on some belly fat from shit food. You pretty much sign a waiver to eat shit food when you blaze the chronic. You can tell yourself you will eat carrot and celery sticks but the medicated mind overrides that. You can exert willpower to a point but it ain’t sustainable. It’s a drug with a few cons. The cons have been slapping me in the face now during this quarantine for awhile.

Today I told myself I ain’t smoking today by myself. It’s kinda pathetic to self medicate in general but during this shit, no way Jose. I’ll come back to weed here and there in a social setting. It’s the only way to enjoy it, everything put here is meant to be enjoyed with respect. Problem is here on leaves we have other problems in our lives we don’t address and we think weed is the main focal problem and we come here think weed is the enemy. weed certainly isn’t the saving grace and solution to all life’s problems, it’s a nice additive just gotta respect it.  just don’t  abuse it or it WILL ABUSE YOU 100x worse.

I got 10+ years of regular I buy weed a lot  smoke experience, alone, with friends, with girlfriends. 

The summary is when you try to control things, THEY CONTROL YOU. Obviously I’m controlling my usage today because I know if I smoke alone and eat like an asshole I will wake up hating myself. I know if I wait until this pandemic is over, that smoke session with a friend over laughs will be good. To some this post may offend because I’m defending weed. Like I said, weed had PROS and CONS.

Well here is my problem, I used to smoke weed pretty much since my high school permanently, but always with some peace. But then, 3 years ago I had very bad motorbike accident and I literarly destroyed whole mine face (skull, nose, jawbone, many teeths, ...) So I looked pretty much like zombie couple months, with way less of my memory, and many stress from all the problems around (without any lasting consequences, except the visible scars all over head and not very uniform face). 

I started smoking weed to chill-out. Then in a few weeks of recovery, girlfriend broke up with me after many years ... that was the thing which got me together with that accident TOTALLY to the very bottom of myself. 

I started to smoke like 3g average every day untill now with NO break. So in last three years I smoked couple kilos of weed, I ve super isolated of friends, family, any hobbies, alone ... just far away of ANYTHING. I am swiming in depresion, anxiety ...

I tried many things, like sport, change profession, read, move to another country, ... also a psychotherapist but I stoped visiting him and gave that up as any other of mine trials. For half a year I unfortunately ""tried"" also cocaine. I fell into that as crazy as like with weed and I was 24/7 with it for a couple months, thanks god, somehow I quit that. With cocaine i feel over it, I did not touch it more then a year now.

I belived girl could be also some help, but I am totally without interest to meet anyone. Luckly some girls has been about me, but as I described ... I did not feel I care .... I basically did not want, I was not shy or anything like that. Just no interests.

Simply, last few years I can not belive it is me, before the accident I was someone absolutely else ...

I am so lost and empty mind, I do not even know what I am asking here for, but ...

I smoked pot for over 25 years, and was a chronic user – i.e. every day, throughout the day – for 15 years. For many years I didn’t see weed as a problem: I wasn’t particularly happy, but I found smoking pleasurable and I was certainly more cheerful when stoned than when I wasn’t. Then, in my late 30s, I had a good reason to cut down (I’d enrolled on a BA degree course) and found I was unable to. So I tried to quit altogether, and found I couldn’t do that either. I’ve now been clean for nearly 14 years – via the 12-Step programme of recovery. It’s not for everyone, but it certainly worked for me! The thought of a weekend without a weed – let alone a lifetime – used to terrify me: my experience of being straight was one of boredom, anger, anxiety and misery. Since finding the programme, however, I’ve experienced a degree of contentment, peace of mind and fulfilment that I wasn’t even able to imagine in my previous life. If you have a similar problem – i.e. unable to control your weed intake and equally unable to quit altogether – I’d be very happy to share my experience with you (this is partly how I work my programme and maintain my recovery). (NB but I’m not really interested in discussing whether or why the 12 Step programme works – as I say, it worked for me and thousands of others, but it isn’t for everyone…)",26,0

Not quite sure what true clarity will be like.

I maintain a well paying career in tech, am 1.5 years married, and have used my stability as justification to smoke 💨 all the time. 

The high is just not satisfying as much anymore. 

I fantasize about the intoxication of sobriety (almost nostalgically)

I’ve wanted to reduce my intake, take a break, quit... Never was able to bring myself to.

Fast forward to 4/19 - I start getting sick (doctor tested and verified. Fever, contagious, the whole shebang)

I pick up a huge stash on 4/20 from the local dispensary (recreation/legally). Tried a bit. Felt awful. Haven’t smoked since. Illness + high don’t play nice.

It’s been 5 days of being sick and no thc at all.

Have been experiencing high fever (over 100) and many other symptoms.

Shakes, sweats, shivering, lack of appetite.

I haven’t been able to tell between what symptoms are from getting sick and which are withdrawal symptoms. They are both characteristic of my illness and what I’ve heard withdrawal symptoms are like.

Psychologically it’s helping me avoid temptation.

It’s been the longest break I’ve had in a while and I believe it may be the push I need to truly stop.

I’m worried about once I’m no longer sick and I’m just left with withdrawal symptoms. What to expect on day 7 onwards?


Tl/dr
Got sick unrelated to 🍁 . Haven’t smoked in five days. Not feeling strong urge due to illness. Post-illness, I hope to carry that momentum towards a longer much needed 🍁 distancing and find some lost clarity. What to expect on day 7 onwards ?",4,1

Figured this was a good time to write this as I’m laying in bed at 4 am, unable to fall asleep. Just wanted to give you all (and myself) a pros/cons list for stopping smoking.

I stopped smoking because it had been three years since I hadn’t smoked daily. (Minus one 10 day t-break). I want to see the difference between me being a daily smoker and me being sober. Also, I want to have dreams again.

Pros: I feel so much more involved in conversations, I ask provoking questions rather than saying “that’s crazy.” My thought are clearer, I feel as if the haze is lifting. I have so much more motivation. Since stopping, I’ve begun working out again, eating right, and I’m ahead of where I should be on my finals! My cough is essentially gone. I feel like I’ve finally freed myself from the chains that kept holding me back from socializing and progressing my career.

Cons: can’t sleep, no appetite, cravings, boredom, stomach aches, crazy mood swings, profuse sweating in the little sleep that I get, headaches, and (I know it’s gross) diarrhea.

It’s tough right now, but I won’t let myself smoke because I know as soon as I do, I’ll feel guilty and ashamed that I couldn’t make it to my goal of at least a month. I’m really excited to see what physical/mental changes take place over the next month. As weird as it sounds, I’m looking forward to all the cons that come with not smoking because I know my body is doing what it needs to do to get back to normal.

My gut's been telling me I should quit again but I really haven't had the heart to do it. I've been sober these last few days by force but now I'm starting to turn towards the mindset of making a conscious decision to remain clean from weed. That little voice of reason is growing but it's hard to trust myself. 

I'm just afraid of waking up tomorrow in a different mood with a text from my connect saying ""come by whenever"". We all know what that feels like....when the plug comes through. Especially when your plug is a cute girl that you have a little crush on. 

These couple days of being clean have been a little refreshing and I feel a bit more in touch with myself. But that also brings about facing my demons and living in reality. Marijuana is a nice way of masking the pain of life...just get faded and submit to apathy and ignorance.

I went through a bit of a rough patch in my life about 8 months ago. My girlfriend broke up with me out of the blue after 2 years of dating. It was my first long term relationship, and the first person I legitimately and truly loved. So needless to say I didn't have any coping skills.

Anyways, that's when I started smoking weed again. I used to smoke quite a lot of weed in my freshman year of high school, but quit it in my grade 11 and 12 years. It was pretty easy at that time because I just didn't really want to smoke anymore, so quitting was easy. My gf broke up with me a few months after we graduated. 

So I started smoking weed after that. I started smoking very little amounts, like once or twice a month when I would have some friends over, or sometimes I would do it with my brother (who I live with). Slowly I started doing it more and more, up to every weekend, Friday, Saturday, and sometimes Sunday. At that point I was still only doing it with friends or my brother, I never smoked alone yet. 

After a few months of smoking only on weekends, I started smoking every now and then alone at nights, and sometimes, but rarely, during the day if I didn't have work. Once I hit that point I was doing it nearly everyday. Until I did start doing it everyday. Every night I would smoke. 

After that I started doing it to enhance everyday experiences like video games, eating, jerkin off, etc. Basically if I was going to do something, I would smoke first. It had gotten to the point where I hadn't really been sober for more than a few hours a day at best. And I realized it was a problem a little over a week ago, so I  went cold turkey. Weed no longer made me feel good or happy. It just felt like being sober again. Being high was my new sober. And I hated it. I hated how it made me feel, how it made me feel dumb, and how it made be feel okay with just being okay in life. 

And that brings me to where I am now. Slightly depressed but still livin. And it brings me right back to where I was at square one. It all started with the break up and I still feel like I'm not over it. And I used weed to feel like I was over it. It's now 1:40AM and I really want to smoke. I got rid of my stash but I still have a few shavings left in my grinder. And I still have my bong, bubbler and pipe in my room. Not sure what to do to resist the urge.

Normally about this time I would be higher than a kite but thankfully those days are hopefully gone for good this time. I’ve just been laying in bed thinking and I realized that my group of friends and our relationship with each other have felt much more shallow the past couple of years, ever since all of us started smoking heavily. 

There’s about roughly 7 of us and we all knew each other since middle school. Im 23 now, all of us are roughly the same age. It crazy for me to think there was a time we weren’t just “smoking fat” together, we all started using daily roughly freshman year of college. We used to do crazy adventurous shit in high school. We would drive out to somewhere cool and go hiking. Explore construction sites late at night. Play wild truth or dare games in the jacuzzi when we still had friends who were girls in the group. Stay up till 5 talking about actual “deep” stuff. You guys get the point. Most importantly we were all really close with one another. Most of us knew what was going on in our personal lives to a deeper extent if that makes sense. 

Then freshman year of college came around, we all started to pick up marijuana as our new hobby one by one. It started when my friend had an open house for two weeks and boom out of nowhere we all just started to get high everyday. Fast forward to present time and all the stuff i mentioned we used to do above, we haven’t done in years. I get we’re all older now and we don’t have time to always go out and do crazy shit anymore. However what I miss most is actually having meaningful conversations with all of them. It feels like when we are all high our personalities are muted. We don’t really ask each other questions about our lives and when we do 9/10 times the response is “it’s been alright bro”. or something along the lines of that. All of our conversation has just been filler conversation. Like what dank new wax this person has and “bro look how clean this shit is” type of conversations. It kinda makes me sad because i’ve known my boiz for a decade now and i know inside all of them have very colorful personalities and all of them are very intelligent too. However ever since we all started to “smoke fat”, all of that has faded away. 


I don’t know if it’ll ever come back, smoking is such a big part among my friends. literally when we hang we smoke. There isn’t a question about it. Hanging out sober is about as realistic as the earth being flat. These guys are like my family, i’m still grateful to have them around and i hope it will stay that way for as long as i’m alive. 


Thankfully i managed to quit, but i’m not sure if i can convince my friends to. As ex smokers know we all had our reasons to keep using . Mine being “i need it to relax after a long day of studying”. However after quitting i’m sure most of us realized that those reasons really were just excuses, and relaxing can be laying in bed typing this long ass post. I’m just worried my group of friends will be hooked to this for much longer than they need to because “weed helps me [insert excuse]”. I’m not trying to be some dude who’s like “i’ve quit weed and my IQ just increased by 578 points why am i surround by stupid people”.  I truthfully just miss having meaningful connections with one another, and i especially miss feeling like a family instead of just stoner friends. That’s what makes me feel the most sad.

TLDR; Known my friends since middle school. Used to be tight af and went on a bunch of crazy adventures with each other. All of us started smoking. Whatever i said above doesn’t happen anymore.",6,0

I've smoked pot since i was maybe 14, am 33 now. went through a few periods of sobriety, lasting up to a maximum of 6 months. I wish I never started, half of my life has passed, and it was wasted and squandered, hurting other people so i could get my fix.

I'm mentally disabled, have a past filled with  mental ilness, abuse (physical, mental, sexual,) self harm, and struggling with addiction definitely doesn't make things easier. Yet... weed was, is, my only go to to cope. Cravings, the urge to just escape for a few hours... it's inescapable.... and trying to explain to people IRL tends to be a huge stressor.

I'm sure some of you know the drill. ""Just one bowl"" turns into two, which turns into 8 months of sitting in the same spot, doing nothing but smoking, and barely eating, until you're so malnourished you can barely walk.... doing anything to get your next fix.

I was clean for about 5 months, until August... and ""it was going to be the last time"" Shit was getting in order, i had job offers, was going out, had a wonderful and amazing girlfriend who I loved dearly... 

Then my mother died, and... within seconds of the call, I was on my way to a local dispensary. My girlfriend was out of town, and i just felt so completely and utterly devastated... without a lifeline.

Moved back to my local home town... managed to say sober long enough to deal with the funeral... even got my full drivers license, which I put off for 12 years.... but as soon as that ended... I found myself surrounded by people, yet utterly alone, in a ""new"" town (it changed a lot in 10 years) and without a plan.... 

Of course, that lead to a huge failing. I broke up with my GF, because I felt she wasn't present enough, when I needed her the most (which may be on me, but... thats another story) and spent from then until 3 days ago, in my parents garage, doing nothing but smoking, and staring at a tv screen.

Why is this different? as far as I can recall... whenever i quit in the past, i always waited until I was out to quit. Might mention it to myself ""this is the last one i buy,"" but would always wait. This time, Despite still holding, I was able to force myself to stop...

Every single second since then has been a wave of agony. (except when im able to distract myself) from insomnia to nausea... I know it gets better... That I need to do this... That I want to do this, for myself.... But, except once, every single time, Its been alone.... and I've come to realise that I cant do this alone.",3,0

On December 15th I went on a family vacation for about two weeks out of country and used that as an excuse to jump start my sobriety since I would be physically separated from the substance. After the two weeks I can home back to my roommates who all smoked regularly and still managed to stay off it. 

I just wanted to say that the first few days will likely be really rough especially if you rely on it for sleep like I did, but I think melatonin will help a lot with that (don’t recommend it long term), and after your first few nights you will start to feel better then from there it is all downhill. 

It was honestly pretty easy for me. I might smoke again someday but it would only be a puff or two of a joint. Sometimes I miss it, but only for the social aspects. I think about all the money I’ve saved and time I’ve spent with a clear mind not being stoned and I don’t regret it one bit. 

I recommend physically distancing yourself from the substance and people who use it a lot, or at least try your best. Once you surpass a week I think you will begin to feel a lot better and it will only get easier.

Put 2 towels across the bottom of your bed so if you get sweaty feet that well catch it and you won’t feel all sweaty in your blanket.

Then I usually drink a warm glass of milk. Not sure why but it helps. 

Even if you’re cold and you’re still sweating. Open the window and put a fan directly on you.. I know that sounds stupid. But it works Atleast for me. Keeps my cool and at a perfect temp so I don’t have the chills. 

Last but not least. If the stomach pain from withdrawal keeps you up. Get a heating pad/ bag of rice. Make it pretty warm and lay it on your stomach. Totally helps a lot.

As a particular situation of Brazil, the quality of the herb that we have acess is like a shit (it comes from Colombia and Paraguay by drug dealers that run the risk in the borders). So, its common in between the smokers here to think that ""all bad effects that we feel are because we do not have acess to a plant with quality"".

I still experience cravings, both physical and emotional. I miss weed, I miss the habit, and I miss burying my emotions. I know you're not ""supposed"" to say that, but
I've always been an honest person, and it's the truth. Last year, around October, I was diagnosed with C-PTSD due to an event which happened in 2015 and I realised that
I'd been using weed to hide my emotions and pain over this. Now I'm not blitzed every night (mostly evening only smoker), I am having to face a lot of painful emotions (not just
related to the C-PTSD) and feelings every day. However I AM doing it, and I'm slowly understanding that dealing with emotional pain face to face, so to speak, is actually
helpful, especially as I have a wonderful support network around me.

Anyway. On to my main problem. Soon I am going to be meeting up with a friend of mine for the first time in a long time - I last saw her before the lockdown. She and I
became friends over our mutual love for MJ. I love her, she's a great person, fun to be around, and is generally a decent and kind human being. But, we love to smoke 
together. I am incredibly tempted to join her for a spliff when I see her. If I told her I was on a break from weed she would totally support that and be understanding,
so I'm not worried about her pressuring me or judging me; I'm worried that I can't trust myself. I haven't found these 14 days too awful, so why can't I have a little
toke and forget all the bullshit for a while? I will not lie to myself, I'll reset my Grounded streak and go back to Day 1, my brain is making all kinds of excuses as to
why it would be fine for me to enjoy a couple puffs. I WANT to enjoy a couple puffs (and then fully intend to go back to nothing at all for as many days as I want before I
smoke again). I never said I was going to quit MJ forever; I wanted to lower my usage and stop using it heavily and daily.

So why do I feel so guilty and worried?",1,1

I started with hitting carts at 17 with one of my only friends at the time. But, within a couple months of starting, I was using a half gram cart every couple days. Eventually, I made more friends who were all stoners and all I would do after school and during lunch is go off-campus or to my friends house to take hits.  I was just high constantly, but it worked out then because my parents were more focused on themselves at the time and I am really good at hiding it so it wasn't obvious. (My parents are extremely anti-weed, anti-drugs, etc. so if I ever got caught I would get like kicked out of my house). I took hits so often that I would be going to class high, taking hits in the bathroom during class, and just like falling asleep randomly.

Anyway, this continued until I moved to a different state for college, and I decided I was going to be done with weed for good. But, within the first month, one of my floor-mates found a plug and I started buying carts again. By my second semester, I was using 1 full gram cart every 3 (sometimes less) days. I was spending so much money. I did really bad in all my classes and basically had to drop like half of my classes at college that semester. Most of my friends were using carts too so it was really easy and I would just sit around and take hits with them all night in my best friend's rooms, although I feel like I kind of feel responsible as the instigator of that in the group. During that semester, I got caught by the school too. Now that I look back, being high with my friends was some of the best times we've ever had, but it did come with other costs that I didn't fully realize.

That summer, I had to take the classes that I failed again, and I stopped using weed for 3 months. But, immediately next semester, I started using carts again. When I ran out of carts, I started smoking real bud with my friends more often. I began realizing more and more that the high wasn't the same and that it was destroying so many aspects of my life. My social experience was not to its potential, and sleeping until 2pm, ordering unhealthy high food at like 3am, and not even enjoying some things unless I was high. I was always super stressed and sad if I wasn't high.

I'm home now, and I've been using carts, taking breaks only because I run out carts way faster than my friend can get them for me. Anyway, I ran out of weed on 4 days ago. It's been the hardest thing ever - I've been feeling horrible and having literally every symptom. While I have massive cravings, I think it's time for me to stop weed completely. I've been telling myself every time I restart that I will use it less but it never ends up happening and I don't think it ever will because I have such an addictive personality and I just can't control myself using it.",3,0

I woke up and said enough is enough. I won’t lie, I smoked a little bit of weed today as a final goodbye which was probably a bad move. But I had over 6 grams left, I flushed everything except a bowls worth. My sleep schedule has been screwed by not working so I figured this might help me sleep a little early and start a new journey bright and early tomorrow with a run and some homework. 
Still have to throw out my dugout and chillum, as well as have my girlfriend hide her edibles and her paro, but I’m serious about it this time. 
Got a call from my job this morning and we are starting work up again on Monday, so hopefully a routine and 8 hours a day around a bunch of boomers can keep me busy enough to not think about weed anymore.

Gonna see if I can pick up more hours at my part time and flood myself with work and see if that has a positive effect. If I’m not bored I shouldn’t feel a craving is my logic.

Couple days ago I did something stupid. I don't think it was the weed that led me to it as I have been depressed for several years now. I posted to suicidewatch the other day because I had just gotten high and decided to walk down to the lake at my park. The whole time it felt like a dream, and I had so many emotions going through me. My mind was telling me ""kill yourself"". ""There's no point"". I thought I would stop myself while walking there but I didn't. I got to the lake with overwhelming thoughts of drowning myself and I just started balling my eyes out. It makes me really sad to think about this. I read a bunch of reddit comments on my post that day which helped me out.  I can't even think of it vividly, it doesn't feel real. I don't know if I have a weed issue or not, but I'm worried it's going to affect my mental health. 

Weed is still fun to me, but my life feels pointless at times. I feel like days are just blurring like time is not going by. I don't remember my days anymore. I hope this whole coronavirus thing lets up. I'm worried, that staying in has been worsening my mental health drastically. I'm worried I'll never move on from this. I don't know if I should quit weed or not, but I really don't want to and I'm afraid if I won't be able to cope without it. I've always felt depressed and that life is meaningless but I felt weed gave me a purpose, gave me a feeling, gave me something that I actually cared about in this world.

I’ve come to y’all for my journey on quitting all weed/ carts... so here’s a bit about me first... I’m 16,overweight,broke,barley getting through high school, I got depression and anxiety.  here’s the story.. So I started smoking around December of 2018? 
Carts and weed on and off. (I Would only smoke if I knew I was staying at that persons house that night) kept that up for awhile. 
Then around march or April of 2019 is when they started coming into my town and people I knew were getting them. 
And so when summer started is when I actually started buying carts. I used to use them only to go to bed. (In the summer) 
Then come September.. and I started to maybe take a few rips before school.  Then it turned to a.. “oh I’ll take a few hits when I get home and off the bus wouldn’t hurt” well that was my routine for awhile(mind you on the weekends I’m with my friends smokin bud). 
But then it as it progressed into 2020 it turned into. (I need to be high so I don’t feel abnormal anymore) and so I’d have to be high 24/7 to make it through my day and that’s not how I wanted to live anymore and I know these street carts are slowly killing me. And it’s burning a damn hole in my pocket!  (I’ve been having thoughts of quitting on and off in my mind) So i talked to my mom about it and last night around 6pm I threw everything I had out. All my empty carts,the cart I still had. Everything. I mean I still got my battery’s and stuff. But I threw everything out. And it felt sorta good. Because I know I’m doing good. So the first night of sleep wasn’t horrible. I took melatonin. And I only woke up 3 times lol. The stomach pain and no appetite is there for sure and I definitely have some sweats. Not bad tho. Same with cravings. My craving are eh. But as of now as I’m writing this post it’s basically been a full day without a hit of a cart and I’m pretty proud of myself. If the stomach pain wasn’t there I feel I’d help a lot more. Also I am kinda weak and definitely drowsy but I know in the end it’s worth it. If anyone knows how to Atleast tolerate stomach pain plz let me know. I’ve been drinking lots of water and gatoraid for electrolytes. But food is hard to get down. I’m not pukey like I haven’t puked. But the second food hits my mouth or stomach it’s like swallowing a bag of rocks. Gaggy, like a bloated feeling. I’m hoping that goes away soon. But this is my journey and I thought I might share it with y’all.. if anyone has ANY suggestions to help tolerate this or methods or anything please let me know. Or if anyone has experience with this how long do these effects usually last? Thank you for listening and I’ll be back tmr for a day 2 update!  day 1✅",4,0

I wanted to share this passage from Judith Grisel's ""Never Enough"" that describes her experience. Grisel was a hardcore drug addict (who loved marijuana most of all, in her telling) who got clean and became a neuroscientist specializing in addiction. Here's what she shares in the chapter of her book about marijuana (bolding mine):  


>*My first few months without pot were especially miserable. Though I was in a new environment, with new friends and countless novel experiences, I remember very little and experienced everything as bland beyond belief (in addition to feeling anxious, depressed, and ashamed). However,* ***about three months into my new drug-free life****, I was walking along a street in Minneapolis and nearly fell to my knees, struck by the brilliance of the fall foliage. All around me were a million bright oranges, reds, yellows, and greens; I must have felt the way the first viewers of movies in Technicolor did. Where had all this come from? In fact, downregulation had reversed with my abstinence. As my receptors returned, so did my appreciation for everyday beauty.*  
>  
>*Fortunately,* ***after nine long years pining away****, I realized one day that I didn’t crave marijuana.*

  
This is just Grisel's account of her own experience, but I thought it might interest others as she was both an addict as well as a scientist with the appropriate background to understand some of what's going on here. You can look for short term results around three months into the quit -- the ability to take interest in other things, subsiding of withdrawal symptoms, etc. And it will take much longer to stop thinking about marijuana altogether -- but it will come.",27,0

No, there's nothing significant about this number of days. What *is* significant, though, is that I didn't realize that for the past 10ish days I had completely forgotten about my sobriety! No cravings, I'm fine being bored and by myself, and my depression/anxiety  seems to have receded to a place that is so much more manageable. I **love** sleeping and my dreams have gone from overwhelmingly lucid, to just.. fucking awesome. These past couple months I've learned so much about myself and feel like I've grown simply by enduring through the withdrawals. 
Here are a few tips I found useful to get to this point:

1. Download the Quit Weed app. It walks you through the phases of sobriety without judgement. Looking at my counter daily made it easier to see how far I'd come and more painful to reset the clock. 

2. Accept that you wouldn't be where you are unless there was something broken in your life. Spend some time identifying what that thing(s) is and then - IMO - accept that too. Everyone is going to tell you to work on yourself but accepting your faults, weaknesses, past mistakes and wounds are a part of that too.

3. Quitting is hard. Look at everyday of your sobriety as a hurdle that you've overcome, because *it is.* My addiction left me feeling like I had no will power or self control. Everyday I stayed sober I earned a little bit of that back.

4. This might seem obvious but avoid temptation. At first I wanted to keep hanging out with my stoner buddies because it was my decision to quit and I didn't want to push it on them. But this is **your** life. 10 years from now they aren't the ones that have to take accountability for where you're at. **You do.** 
And hey, that doesn't mean you have to burn bridges. They just need to understand that your friendship is no longer going to be contingent on being high together. You'll be surprised how many of them are going through the same struggles as you.

\- If I'm high, I want to keep smoking until I go to bed

These are the two rules that negate every other rule I create. So if I create rules, and I have weed, I constantly have a nagging feeling of having a bag on the shelf; if I smoke with friends and leave I want to pick up to continue, lest I feel like I haven't reached the right level yet (and wake up the next morning with some leftover stash).

Short background:

I smoked for 5 years, almost every day of 2016 & 2017, and still greater than 300/365 days of 2018 & 2019. The usual was two joints per day but there were plenty of days we smoked over 6 a day. I loved it, I had some of my best moments spaced out on THC, I won't lie.

I called it quits on the 13th of March, for personal reasons, I felt like I had just had it all and there wasn't any uniqueness to the experience anymore, but largely motivated by the stories on this sub. I gave in on my 8th day, purely out of courtesy, it was a ""welcome back home"" joint my cousin, who I frequently smoked with, rolled me when I returned home after the COVID 19 University closures. But that 8th day joint fucked me up so much, I felt like that was the day I found the real reason and the real motivation to never smoke again.

42 days later, my personal experience has been that of very minimal cravings, improved feeling of well being, and just sudden ""What's with all of these weird dreams the last 1 week?"" that I noticed at around my 12th day in. I wouldn't really say I've had any struggle with anything, and I count myself lucky for that when I see some people on here struggle here and there. I've also had much clarity in thought and I feel a lot level headed generally.

I've had that feeling of ""I think smoking one wouldn't be a bad idea, I'd have it under control just liked I've done these last few weeks"" but I know better than to trust that feeling. I plan on only declaring it safe after cancelling out all the years I spent smoking, after 5 years. 

And I'd just love to encourage everyone on here, keep on going on, you'll thank yourself for not caving in down the line. Remember that you're doing yourself a favour and caving in is swinging a wrecking ball into that house you're building and you won't really be doing yourself much of a favor by doing that. I'm rooting for you, we can absolutely do this.",26,1

Already I am starting to feel a lot of the benefits that people mention here through their own experiences.

Things I have found:

1. I like mornings again. Feel less groggy and have a good routine going which sets me up for the rest of the day. Before I would sleep away until the afternoons.
2. Sleep at night is hard. Chamomile tea (which someone recommended here) is definitely helping, have about 2 cups a night at the moment.
3. I am more motivated in general and things which I would put off when stoned or in the stoner mindset have become the core of my day.
4. Dreams. I wasn't sure this would actually be a thing but wow the dreams.... some good, some bad. Some seem to be trying to process things which happened a long time ago in my life which feels liberating.
5. Emotions are strong. Things which I have been suppressing are now waking up and showing themselves. I have to confront them now and not smoke them away.
6. I've wasted so much time. I wish I started this journey a long time ago and really regret not listening to loved ones who urged me to try. I can't help but feel a massive guilt around that.
7. I'm excited. Looking forward to pushing on and how I will feel after 2 weeks, 3 weeks and so on.

A few years ago, I had been doing a lot of research into quitting pot. I even made it 4-5 days sober. However, that all went by the wayside and I accepted that I am just a stoner and that weed is and always will be a part of my life.

I’m now 27, and I’ve been smoking more or less everyday since I was 20. I smoke all the time - If I’m skiing, if I’m outside, if I’m watching tv, if I’m going for a walk in the park. The excuse I’ve always had is that I’ve been able to find “success” despite my habit. I’m someone who can get up and workout at 5:30. I have an interesting and very lucrative career many would kill to have. But, I’ve almost always been single (though plenty of girls have been and are interested in me). I believe this is partially due to my habit.

During quarantine, I’ve begun to have a bit of an existential crisis with marijuana. Since I’ve no longer been going into the office each morning, I was smoking in the morning during the first few weeks I was stuck at home. I’ve managed to stop doing that, but smoking still resulted in some rather large fuck ups at work. Those have triggered a resurgence of thoughts surrounding quitting. 

Some questions for you folks:

- what was the impetus or breaking point that caused you to quit smoking?
- have you noticed any changes in your relationships?
- have any of you been able to resume an occasional habit with marijuana? Like, use it once per week after work? Or is it something you had to quit altogether?
- how has your sleep changed since you quit?
- what’s the best advice you have for someone in my shoes?",19,1

I don't miss weed as much as I miss feeling calm. Chill. Blue screen in my brain. I have been more active for the past 5 days than I had been in a long time, and as much as I appreciate how clear things are becoming, I also feel guilty for having started using it in the first place. I hate not being in control of my feelings, and meditation is only helping to a certain extent.

My anxiety is worse these days, but it's not the same kind of anxiety I'd get by smoking a lot. It's anxiety with a pinch of despair haha. I teach during the week and it was almost a religious cerimony to catch a fire once I was done with work. Now everytime I hang up a video conference with a student, I catch myself in the middle of an anxiety attack and honestly it doesn't feel like it's getting any easier. I miss my green reward. I miss enjoying food (I've lost like 5 pounds since I quit). I miss having a regular poo schedule (right after the first morning joint and a cup of coffee :P). I miss burning through the days during quarantine. Isolation is not as fun as weed made it seem. 

I have no other option than to continue in abstinence. I've got nothing in the house and I'm prioritizing my financial stability at the moment. But I don't know how this will continue to affect me. I'm trying to stay positive and focus on the benefits of the process, but I feel quite sad. It feels like I'm grieving the loss of a good friend.

I'm here trying to find some motivation to push forward with this, mainly 'cause I don't have another option. I would appreciate loads if some of you could share a few tips on handling withdrawal or breaking these annoying trigger patterns. I want to believe there is a better world waiting for me at the end of this journey.

One day when I was having issues with someone in my life, I turned to weed as I thought it would help me feel better. Oh I was so wrong. As soon as I smoked I became flooded with paranoia. The weed made me overthink every little aspect of my life. Once I relapsed, I started to smoke more often and often until, bam I was smoking every day again. This relapse really made me understand that I never want to go back to smoking. I hated the feeling of smoking, and that’s what I’ve learned since my last relapse. Weed made me so lazy, unmotivated, groggy, and depressed. I’ve always felt guilt for doing this for so long and putting a burden on my loved ones and my girlfriend. The face my girlfriend made when she found out I relapsed broke my heart. It will be 5 weeks sober this coming Sunday, and I now know I will never touch the shit again. Quitting weed has improved my life in countless ways. I’m so excited to feel like how I used to before I started smoking. I was the kid in school that people would say I’ll never quit. Well look at me now. Be proud and forgiving to yourselves, look forward, and tell yourself it’s the only way. I feel relieved that this horrible nightmare of cycling through being high and sober is ending. I’m not in the clear yet by far, but now I know what I want in life and nothings going to stop me. If I Hadn’t relapsed, I would’ve been 5 months sober now. Just thinking about the time lost is making me go insane. Now I use this relapse as motivation to never do it again. Sometimes you need situations like these in order to reinstate why you quit in the first place. I wish all of you the best, be proud of the decision you’re making, and look forward to living as the best version of yourself.",2,0

Number 23 especially: "" I couldn't think quickly and lost my charm, spark with people and quick wit. ""

I feel like before I started smoking I could say small jokes and goof around with people much more. Now my head stands still. At my new job when people joke with me I just laugh and can't come up with anything myself. I rarely start talking to someone first because I don't know what to say. My brain is just empty. Sure I'm an introvert and small talk has always been hard for me because it's just not interesting, but I feel a big difference over just 6 months.

Going on dates has been really hard. I've went to only 1 and it was awful so I got scared. Everytime I open up tinder now I have no interest in meeting anyone, or even chatting with someone because I know that I'll fuck it up eventually. I know that I'm a fun person when you've gotten to know me but no one wants to hang out with me until then (that's what I say to myself).

My memories have gotten fucked up too. And when I try to talk about something my words just don't really know where to go. I start out with a clear thought but as I speak I forget and I just sound so fucking stupid. I noticed this in the guy that became my dealer later on. Whenever he talked it sounded so uninteresting and he didn't feel confident about what he said so he was mostly quiet. I didn't like him because he had no personality, and now I feel like that. My responses are mostly ""yeah, damn, that sucks, I see, okay"" and nothing more because I can't fucking come up with anything.

Good: Sometimes after smoking, I'll have the urge to go make a to-do list, start doing things right, and just have this feeling of I-should-get-my-life-together. Almost like weed makes me feel and think more clearly. 

Bad: Sometimes after smoking, if I'm not feeling all that, I'll start to think of things like... ""Maybe I am overreacting about *that* situation,"" ""If I do this, it'll make me look like xyz,"" ""I should stop cutting because there will be bad consequences."" I included the last one because this was something I felt when I use to self-harm. Looking back, I wonder if I should've listened to my high self. 

Does high me know better than sober me? But sober me feels better. I don't have these thoughts like I am overreacting about how I think my friends are treating to me. Why would these thoughts only happen when I'm high? This is where I started to feel like I was almost 2 different people when I was high. 

High me: I should stop cutting, I sound so dumb, I am overreacting me

Sober me: I sound rational, I know my feelings matter

And, then if we make the conclusion that high me is just overly paranoid...why do I get the urges MOST to stop smoking when high? 

Which one is the rational one? Which one is the wrong one? Ugh. I promise you this isn't me with DID or psychosis or anything. I just don't know whether it's anxiety or my mind actually being smarter when I'm high.

I’ve been getting high since I was 13, my older sister (now 21F) and my dad also smoked weed. She gave it up 5 years ago and was beyond angry when I was still smoking after seeing all of the awful ways it impacted her life. When she was stoned she had no social life. She dropped out of school to get high as a means to treat depression, and now has severe memory issues to this day over certain things. Although this has improved over time with her, she still doesn’t remember certain things that happened in our childhood or certain places we’ve been before and it’s upsetting.

Nonetheless I still smoked when I graduated, and slowly it became all I did too. I thought if I could function and hold a job and a social life then weed wasn’t as bad for me as it was for her, but I was wrong. It ramped up, getting high all the time, putting on weight. Lots of bullshit side effects I refused to accept from my miracle drug.

Here’s where Just Dance comes in.

When I was high all that time, I never wanted to talk to my family. I would keep conversations brief because I couldn’t follow the jokes, and it was too straining on my mind to know when to laugh or when to nod my head with concern. Conversations made less and less sense. So I did withdraw. For a LONG time.

I am now 112 days sober. And I am so happy. It’s not directly because of sobriety, but because of the desire I have to get my life together. My relationships have never been stronger, and that’s what keeps me sober, even in quarantine, in a house full of weed. My now sober sister, little middle school brother, and I turned on Just Dance and played for hours. I felt so comfortable and safe. We laughed so hard and it wasn’t the kind of stoned laughter that’s fleeting. It’s the kind of memories and happiness that lasts beyond a few hours, and my mind has the capacity to remember it all, much much more clearly and fruitfully than before.

We were acting like little kids again. Something that never would have happened if she and I kept smoking. We would’ve stuck to our video games, on our phones, quiet and in our own heads. Or if we actually did ever play this game high, we wouldn’t have been able to really really get into it, to really feel the connection with our brother and really feel like we are best friends. There’s a weird sort of half death feeling I feel with pot, although it can make some aspects of life feel more lively, it is in fact so much harder to exist in that state. It’s dangerous to be in that place all the time. To not learn. To not remember. To not have lasting happiness created by our own minds. 

I’m just rambling now. I’m just really happy I have accomplished this. It took so many attempts to quit. To those of you reading who are waiting for the right time, please do this now. Life feels like living when you actually let yourself exist as yourself.",26,1

This has been an absolute nightmare. I have a history of addiction issues. Nothing, NOTHING has been as hard as this particular detox. I stopped drinking in January so I started smoking more weed, and little by little I got to the point where I started the moment I woke up and went all day. I started being unable to do anything without weed--dishes, sweeping, writing, running, you name it. So I decided to stop.

To say this detox has been horrific is an understatement. I am 9 days in, and my body has gone into such shock that I am speechless. I've had terrible sleep due to vivd nightmares and waking up soaked in cold sweat multiple times a night. Intense headaches, fatigue, and nausea. Then, I got a urinary tract infection (my doctor told me due to shock and dehydration from sweating so much), and my hair is falling out. This has been so scary. I am quarantined alone.

I'm frustrated and sad that there is not more information out there about how you can be physically dependent on marijuana. I wouldn't wish this on anyone, and I never would have gotten to this point of smoking if I'd known what this detox would entail. I PRAY I am over the  worst of it, taking lots of time to rest my body and give myself compassion. The only good thing about this detox is that it ensures me from ever smoking again.

I don't know who is reading this (obviously) but if you are bored and think you could help me, then please do... I am going to do my best not to ramble and what not but just a forewarning, this post may be a little long... 

I am on day 3 currently of being THC free, which is absolutely remarkable for someone like me... I am 23 years old and am graduating from college this year from Udel. I have been struggling with substance abuse/depression since I was a freshman in High school or even before that. I say drug abuse/depression because it is hard to know what came first. Did my depression cause my substance abuse or did my substance abuse cause my depression? Who knows, doesn't really make a difference. I drank every weekend in high school and that progressed to weeknights, towards the end of high school. Roughly during my senior year of high school, I started smoking weed. Believe it or not, I hated weed at first because it was practically a hallucinogenic at first (if you know you know)... Monday through Thursday I was miserable. I couldn't just do life sober like everyone else, I really didn't and still sometimes don't get the meaning of all of it. I couldn't just go to class all day then go home and have dinner and repeat that cycle over and over again. I needed a reward, I needed something to make the day and ultimately living, worth it...Lets fast forward a little bit...

I'm now 18/19 and going to college.  I have no fricken clue what I want to do in life and after some thought, I concluded the military would be my best option. I did Army ROTC my Freshman Semester at UD and somehow ended up as the #1 cadet for my class. I lived with two roommates who also were in Army ROTC. I drank and smoked just about every single day of that semester and had to hide it from my roommates, they never even knew I had a hit of weed (I smoked with my hometown friends only in their dorm). I found out that my GF at the time cheated on me the first night of college and that fucked me up good. While I was already lost, and arguably depressed, this put me over the edge. I was in bed after a night of drinking and it was roughly midnight. My hometown friends from the floor below came to my room and asked me to smoke but I said no because I had to be up in five hours for Physical Training. They said they would pay for the weed and that I didn't need to pay... That was all they had to say. Leaving the dorm, still a little drunk, I tried to jump down an entire flight of stairs (there was no way there was gonna be a positive outcome the stairs were huge) and I shattered my leg, the bone came out and everything, it was a compound fracture. Lets fast forward a little again.

I am home now, it is 2016 and I am in a massive leg cast. I would sneak out on crutches to smoke and was drinking on the meds they gave me for my leg. I might add, during this whole time, I am clinically depressed and debating life every day, especially because now I am no longer at college and no longer can go to the army... Within a week I tried killing myself. Not some little attempt. I tried to end my life, cutting my arms open until going unconscious type of trying. My mom found me and I was rushed to the hospital where I had emergency surgery on my arms. At this time I was in 3 casts now. One on my leg and two on my arms. So, I need to speed this up, I am sorry guys... From that point in my life, I went to two psych wards which lead to two inpatient rehab trips and the sober livings and all that good stuff. So since I was 18/19 I have been in and exposed to drug addiction and rehabs...

Honestly, for the sake of time, I am going to skip a little time and just get to today and where I am at today... I believe I use marijuana as a medication. While in the past I have been on anti-depressants and shit, the last 3-4 years I have not been on anything and I used marijuana to make me feel better. The thing is though, it was one of the only things that made me feel better. So if I was smoking, I was surviving. Nothing great, but nothing horrible would happen either. Weeks and days go by no problem. Not just one smoke sesh a day either, I mean it varied obviously but I was more or less constantly lit. The money I used for the drugs was my mom's money and  I stole it from her, I might add that too. But when I did not have the weed, things were really bad. I almost always did have weed though and would do my absolute best to never run out... This is the main thing I want to say... Without marijuana in my life and using it as a crutch, I struggle to see the point in living what I perceive to be a boring, mundane life. I need weed as a reward, I need something to look forward to. I can't go through the stresses of daily life without getting rewarded! I know some of you feel me...

In my opinion, weed is one thing... But man, the cartridges/pens are a whole different beast! I could literally be high all day now and that's what I have been doing literally every day for months and years. I am high more than I am sober. And when I am sober I want to get high... Yall know how it goes... ""im done smoking""  \*ends up smoking\*  then, ""ahhh god, why did I even smoke this isn't even that good!""

I withdraw HARD from weed. I'm talking cold sweats, 24/7 nausea, insomnia like you can't believe and most of all I contemplate my life, my existence, and my future. I go back to where I don't see the point in living, I don't enjoy life ""as is"" plain and simple. I realize this is not normal and I wish I weren't like this, but I am... My brother just got his medical card and he treats it like medicine. He essentially has his day down to the dose, and it seems at though he is going to live the rest of his life like that. I have been debating this over time and I concluded that I may do the same. Just feed my addiction so I can feel normal, I feel like that is actually possible due to the minimal physical side effects. THE MAIN PROBLEM, besides being addicting to cannabis is that I HAVE TO stop smoking for a drug test, so I can become an EMT for this hospital I want to work for. Firefighting and EMS is something that kept me in check for most of my life but just recently my addiction got so bad I would smoke (my pen) even though I knew I was on shift that night and that I could be running into a burning building at any point.

So this was good to type out so far and already has made me feel a little better but I want to end with two things. **First, what are your thoughts and feeding into the addiction and jut financially supporting it for . lifetime. People smoke cigarettes there whole life and pay for it... Why can't I just do that with weed. So long as I don't run out, it will not be a problem... And secondly, more importantly, how can I become more okay with being sober and what can I do to feel better when withdrawing so hard.** I have been referring to this thread often and I think just talking to people going through similar stuff is of great benefit to me. 

Like I said.. Day 3 right now (each hour is a drag, sometimes even every minute can feel unbearable.) I have been sober before for a few months some years ago and it was alright but that is it. I called my psychiatrist today and asked him to make an appointment because I think I am going to need to get back on the sleeping meds and anti-depressants if I have even a shot of getting sober. Literally anything yall could say to me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you if you read all of this, you are truly an angel. Thanks again and stay safe everyone.",6,0

I’ve been updating you all these past four days about my progress. 

From the start and why I decided to quit I had a super bad high one day and decided it was time to quit weed forever. I had posted about that terrible high a few days back. 

With that being said I think I need to take a decent break from social media. And yes, Reddit is social media. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love Reddit. But I need to focus on school more, staying away from my horrible vices and I would like to focus on finding a lady and actually take advantage of the quarantine and relax without stressing over checking Reddit as much. 

With that being said I wanna thank you all and will be back soon to update you all again because I feel like it brings out people who are afraid to post, makes the ladies of the sub feel less lonely (because there seems to be more men in here which is totally fine. I’m not complaining about that. But sometimes women relate to other woman better.) 

Once again I love and appreciate you all and I hope you guys continue to fight to be a better version of you and the version you clearly want to become. 

Don’t let your friends put a joint in your hand. If they care about your progress they’ll understand. Don’t let yourself put anything in your hand that pertains to weed because if YOU CARE ABOUT YOU you’ll take care of yourself. 

Exercise, eat right when possible and surround yourself by great people please. Also go outside in a non-compromising area and get some outside air. 

Take care my friends and look after yourselves.

Lately I've been extremely irritable, nauseous, moody.. and my feelings of depression and anxiety have been magnified, partly due to quarantine. 

Everyone on here seems to be doing a wonderful job at quitting during quarantine, but my experience thus far has been the exact opposite. School is finished, I'm not working, and I can't see my friends. I'm currently isolated with my family, who all smoke like chimneys! 

What I'm trying to convey is that I'm having one hell of a time trying to quit, and I would sincerely appreciate any suggestions on how to distract myself from my cravings..",3,2

Me and my friends went out to a ranch to go party, grill over a bonfire fire, drink, shoot guns, feed cows and overall have a great time in a quite area. 

And we achieved that. 

Of course they bought weed, clearly didn’t smoke any. The desire to smoke still isn’t really there. 

Took a few shots here and there. 

The night sweats have stopped but I had a hard time sleeping last night. It was severely broken up sleep. I woke up feeling like shit not from the alcohol, but the fact I couldn’t sleep well at all. (Prolly could’ve been the alcohol tbh.) 

Anyways staying out In the country was nice and got a little get away. 

Ironically me and my other 6 friends all had Corona months back so I guess we were some what safe at that point. 

Hope everyone is doing well and still staying strong and sober from the mariguanas.",3,1

MARY JANE - A BREAKUP STORY

When I first met you I idolized you. You were the ""cool girl"". The girl that accepts you no matter what. The girl that walks in the room and everyone notices.

Everything about you was beautiful. You were so popular. I became infatuated with you. Eventually we became the best of friends. We did everything together. You were the first thing I thought about when I woke up every morning, and last thing at night. We quickly became roomies and shared everything. 

I bought you all the coolest accessories, remember that hot pink grinder? So cute! And the Alice In Wonderland pipe? It made you look sooo good. You made me feel whole. 

You always knew the right thing to say when I was sad. We had some of the best times in my entire life. We graduated highschool together. You got me through my parents divorce. You introduced me to my now husband and most of my friends. I will always love you for that. You helped me get through countless sleepless nights from partying. Gosh we sure did party. You were always by my side in every situation. 

Eventually you started to make me forget things here and there. You made me feel so comfortable that I let everything slide.

I didn't go to college because of you. I didnt form new relationships with people who weren't friends with you like I was. My mom and dad never trusted you. I couldn't understand why. 

When you were gone and I couldn't get a hold of you, my entire world crumbled and I always went and found you again. No matter how much it cost me. I couldn't survive a day without you in my life. I refused. You distracted me. You convinced me it was my fault. I believed you. 

The physical abuse started about a year ago. You attacked my lungs. But I let you. I became numb to it. I just needed you to stay with me. Then the nightmares started. I would run around trying to find oxygen so I could breath. I was gasping for air and I couldn't find any and it was absolutely terrifying. I felt like I was dying. My subconscious mind was screaming at me. This was the only avenue that it had to tell me I was hurting and it was serious. 

I sat down with you and had a really tough conversation. I told you that I couldn't bear the abuse any longer. I needed a break from you. I walked you out the door and sent you on your way. That was so hard. 

Once we separated my wounds started to heal and my nightmares went away. Now my concious mind had it's chance to talk, finally. It told me I locked it in a box 10 years ago. It has been trying to get out ever since. It told me Mary would come and lock it down even more when it started to get to loud. She kept that box from me and I forgot about it. She visited that box often to ensure it wouldn't open. 

My conscious mind had so much to tell me. It embraced me and told me that as long I nurture it, it will nurture me back. It told me not to be scared because it's free now. How did I let this happen? I never meant to let this happen. Although it's a little damaged, it is quickly becoming what it was before. It is reminding me that I enjoy playing the piano and going outside. It is showing me a slide show of all the memories it kept locked away for me. I never thought I would see those again. My concious mind is now my best friend. I am now my best friend. 

I am learning a lot about myself through this breakup. I am closer to myself than I have ever been. As for Mary, I don't hate her, I think she has her place in this life like anything else. I will miss her greatly and I will definitely run into her again here and there. But she is no longer mine. And that's ok.",30,0

I've been off pot for just over a week (took about two weeks prior to that but for a tolerance break as opposed to anything else). I'm not against pot usage as a whole but it was becoming a pretty big issue for me (nightly usage etc.) and I've become determined to prove to myself that I can reliably go without it for extended periods of time. The only issue is that I have been using pot as a sort of 'off switch' at the end of each day for about a year now. I've been dealing with depression and other mental health issues for a good chunk of my life and began smoking really heavily over the last year cope as I felt it relieved the symptoms like nothing else could. I'm currently using alcohol every evening in lieu of the weed, which is something that I'm actually quite against (worked in a liquor store in a bad area, saw, some sad cases) but as of right now going totally dry isn't something I feel I can do without going down a very dark road. Have any of you had to replace pot with alcohol in the short term? If so, would you have any advice on harm reduction etc? I've seen firsthand what alcohol does to people and I'm not eager to trade a habitual smoking problem for a physically addictive drinking one. And yes, I am absolutely seeking professional help for these issues, I'm just looking for short term harm reduction tips because I really do not want to become an alcoholic. I'd rather be addicted to weed over alcohol any day of the week but my ultimate goal is recovery from these issues and the attainment of sobriety. 
Thanks in advance, sorry if this breaks any rules, I certainly don't mean to encourage substance abuse in any capacity whatsoever.",1,0

So yes when I smoked with this scammer I could barley smoke so really never got that high. So I asked my one friend from a previous school is she will sell to me (she said she would when I was 13) and she said she would. Then I was under the suspicion from the posts she was basically working for this plug, which I bought from once at scammers house and I got the proper amount. So I ask her to buy weed (first time she offered in person) no response, then I ask my friend (one who offered me weed when I was 13) and she messaged the plug I already bought from to let me buy from her I guess and I bought from. So I smoked .7 gs just about and smoked some more the next day. Then fast forward a week I bought an eight and smoked like 1.5gs of it (this was like 3 weeks ago still have it I'll tell you why in a bit) then a week later smoked .5ish of weed.

&#x200B;

And then the oh fuck moment. I have to get labcorp test for my medications (usually includes drug test) tomorrow which is 4/24/2020. So hearing this last Thursday, I IMMEDIATELY don't smoke exactly one week later. I've been doing this pretty much every week waiting exactly 7 days. So this monday comes and I want to hit a dab pen I had for months and hit it ONCE to make sure it's real (had it for months) and smoke some of my weed I have. But I know damn sure I can't do that. I needed to get high on something that isn't something worse than weed (well maybe a little worse) so I remember alcohol only stays in your system for 12-24 hours MAYBE 48 so I said I'm good and proceed to drink for the 2nd time in my life. I drank gin just like the 1st time, didn't get drunk like the 1st time but drank to get a fix. My mom was an alcoholic, for a while my dad went for months where he would drink A LOT. My cousin was a drug addict, and my mom's side of the family has some more alcoholics.

I was always afraid that I would get worse smoking but said that ""why should I worry about smoking weed I won't have a job that randomly drug tests me for years"" but always had the plan I'll quit in May 4 weeks before everything opens. But now I'm getting a pretty good job, it's minimal wage, but their company reviews are EXCELLENT, and once your older there is plenty of room for advancements. And you get an almost $500 free pass to use the water park, amusement park WHENEVER YOU WANT!  But I don't wanna take risks, and I was always expecting an entry drug test but I read something that is for j1 students for the company, and THEY RANDOMLY DRUG TEST. I had to pick a job or to do drugs. I might as well call it drugs in the case with the job, because jobs treat weed as cocaine.

I have two options, smoke one more but if I do smoke on Friday, I'll be fucked because it's always good to apply for a job ASAP. And if the state opens up on May 8th (NJ) then I'm FUCKED if I get drug tested. Or the other option save the weed until I know if I get randomly drug tested or not. And if I do, save it for after September because its a seasonal job. I plan to start smoking again probably once the job is over for the season, or if I don't get randomly tested. Or I'm thinking about doing it the legal way once I'm 18, get a mmj card (weed will be legal in jersey by then, so I'll have access to good weed) even if I buy illegally. Because I think the weed is making me stupid tbh which is expected because I'm not 21 (the age to smoke in legal US states) let ALONE the recommended age of 25.

Edit: I thought about it more, I honestly don't wanna touch weed again until I'm 18, and my job allows it. There is no fucking reason for a 15 year old to be smoking weed. I take behavior meds, and they do a lot better job than weed does. Also weed could already be interfering with the meds, so why not I just stop completely. ",3,0

I’m going to quit. I recently moved out of New York City and it felt like I needed weed in order to enjoy my life there or medicate when I felt lonely or overwhelmed. I’m afraid that if I move back, I’ll fall into the same routines. 

If I really think about it, I was probably smoking 3 or 4 days a week. I would go on serious pauses, and be busy with work or school. Whenever I felt like it was a problem I would stop, get out of the unfortunate situation and be on top of my work. Now when I look back on things, I see an unfortunate cycle emerge. That being said I went thru two or three depressive episodes over the past year where I’d stay in bed for a couple days, miss some class: Weed is intertwined with this because it made  the depression pass. But now I’m finding other ways to deal with this, and see that smoking has really reduced the overall external fulfillment I had in life because it eats up time, mental clarity and sustained motivation. It gave me confidence and self love, though. 

I really appreciate this subreddit and identify with a lot of the comments and posts, but it feels like there’s so much regret or shame floating around. Not that’s it’s not true or a good tool, but feeling that way makes me want to smoke (in the sense that I would be able to rationalize those feelings and feel good about myself, in the moment, for half an hour until I gorge my fucking face). Does any one else struggle with this? I want to stop, but I don’t want to feel like an addict, operating with an inferiority complex. I guess I’m just sort of advocating for a way to be mindful about our pasts while establishing personal boundaries.

What I usually tell myself to stop thinking with regret is that the future and present are the only things we can control. It’s mindful to be aware of our negative actions and habits, but dwelling on them can suffocate us. I also feel like because reddit is just anonymous text we are missing out on the full picture, and humanity that we all possess.",8,1

Last year everything was going fine in my life but I was depressed as hell. I needed to change something so I started going to a nutritionist, constant GP consulting and psychological therapy (this one I have done it for a while), not a lot changed with me. Reading r/Leaves posts (and my therapist) encorauged me to stop smoking weed thinking everything was going to be better when I stopped. So I tried really hard to stop smoking (and failed) a lot of times last year, but eventually I managed to stop smoking weed. It took a lot of time since the first time I 'smoked my last joint' in April 20th to the time I really smoked my last joint in February 7th.

I was expecting to be a lot sharper (I've always been sharp tbf), I was expecting to have a lot more energy, (tough I never felt 'the fog') I was expecting to be more clear headed and be 'my old self' (whatever that means), I was expecting to feel healthier, I was expecting to do more things through my days. But I'm not.

But I am not depressed or anxious anymore, I don't bite my nails anymore, I have a lot more success when flirting with ladies, I have a story to tell about how I went from smoking 7 or 8 times a day to not smoking and I I got that going for me, which is fine",2,0

In the last 12 months, I think I spent around 80/85 % of my days without smoking. Which is good ! I'm proud. But it's not enough. 

I think my main problem is that I still consider weed as a way to make my time alone better, more fun, more valuable. I still consider that at some point, even if I have not smoke for months, I will ""allow myself"" to ""have a break"" and enjoy a smoking weekend or something. I wanna get rid of that shitty idea ! 

For example, we've been in lockdown since nearly 40 days in France. My roomate is gonna go to her boyfriends place next monday (he lives not far away) until the end of the quarantine, which will probably be around two weeks after that.

I'm still thinking : ""Come on, two weeks alone in lockdown, let's enjoy that ! Like it's once in a lifetime !""

I've been sober for a couple of days now. Meanwhile I've been trying to quit for quite some time now but constantly failing. This time I decided that things will be different after a confrontation with my family for obviously isolating myself way too much and cutting bonds with important people in my life. That was the cutting line for me since I'm lucky enough to have people who really care for me and would do anything to see me happy.
I won't lie those two days were rough with mood swings, crying, and feeling things that I forgot I could feel. Don't get me wrong it might sound bad but it's quite cleansing.
My only concern though is never being able to smoke again without sliding in the same loophole that I was for 7 months now. I see people being happy quitting once and for all but for me at the moment sounds terrifying not being able to use ever again. It used to be something I enjoyed especially with a group of friends and sometimes it helped me self reflect or even relax and avoiding getting horrible panic attacks.
Maybe it's because it's just the beginning of my sober experience after a long time of using and it will go away eventually. But if it doesn't is it possible to use it responsibly with moderation?

I’ve been smoking on a daily basis for almost two years now; I began smoking moderately ever since I was 18 - I’m 24.

I decided that 4/20/2020 was going to be my last day smoking after about four dozen failed attempts... But this time it was different.

I was so SURE. I am still so sure. I’ve felt like I’ve wasted valuable time in my life and have goals that I wish to accomplish. My biggest fear is being very old and wondering what I’ve been doing with my time here on Earth.

Day 1 was good. I woke up, kept myself busy, and even sat through while all of my friends smoked without an issue. Went to sleep on time.

Day 2 was even better. I felt so amazing once I woke up and instantly took a run outside - My day was fueled with focus and excitement like I haven’t experience in a very long time.

I sat through again while my friends smoked on Day 2, but, I was feeling so great, that I decided to have a drink. I don’t drink often at all. I ended up staying up until 2am, and last night I woke up at 4:30am and desperately tried to go back to sleep. 

After hours of laying on the bed with no result, I had no choice but to get up (responsibilities: self employed, wife, amazing 1yr old son) but I don’t feel good and have a foggy headache.

I’ve been experiencing slight headaches in the past couple of days but this time it’s mixed in with sleep deprivation so I’m worried about today. I want to stay motivated and not be tempted, but I know that my brain may somehow angle this to be an excuse to smoke again.

I want to live a healthier, more full life not just for myself but for my son. 

If you have any advice or tips on staying on track, I will be forever thankful. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I truly appreciate it.

First of all, I'd like to thank this community for helping me stay away from weed. Just minutes ago, I was browsing the website where I purchase bud, trying to decide whether to buy a gram or not. Suddenly for myself I closed the webpage, but that did not mean I overcame the desire to lose my 11-day record of not smoking. Having second thoughts, I once again opened this sub, and reading comments from people who have successfully fought their craving helped me immensely. I now am proud of myself for not giving in this time, and that’s all thanks to you.

I've been smoking almost daily for 3 years, although I wouldn't say I'm the heaviest smoker there is. It's also important to mention that I'm mildly schizotypal - I haven't experienced the worst symptoms in years, but for a very long time all my emotions have been rather dull. This is where weed has helped me greatly: every time I smoked, I had an explosion of emotions inside, and it felt as if weed was digging up the better me from the pit of my personality disorder. Weed allowed me to look inside myself with full honesty, and to enjoy myself like I never could, as I’ve always been in a pretty bad relationship with myself.

It felt great, but all the wonderful benefits marijuana has given me did not make me a better person – it only helped me feel like one. While I was smoking to enjoy myself, my life was falling apart, I dropped out of college, and my relationship with a loving girlfriend became as bland as if we were unhappily married for 40 years. In my adolescent years I was very active and had passion for many things and people in my life, but ever since I started smoking weed regularly, I, as one redditor said, became okay with being bored.

Having no trouble with being bored is one of the scariest things that can happen to an otherwise prosperous and healthy person. While people without an addiction achieve things to feel good about themselves, we, addicts, rely on a temporary high to feel as good as them. And why do we need to achieve anything if we can experience the same dopamine rush without lifting a finger?

If you’re trying to decide whether to quit, whether you’re addicted, know this: when you’re an addict, nothing brings you joy but your drug. Not being with your loved ones, not discovering new things, not enriching yourself culturally and physically, not overcoming the hardships that adult life throws into your face. That’s my case, and once I realized that I only find pleasure in smoking, I decided that it’s time to start rewiring my brain back to normal. I’ve also discovered that the main benefit marijuana was giving me – enrichment of my emotional life – is fake. That might have been the case before I started smoking regularly, but not now. As the fog begins to clear up, I start discovering that I can release my emotions through so much more than weed. I’m still yet to learn how to do that (workout helps greatly), but at least now I can rely on healthy activities instead of one that sucked the joy out of everything else.

I am currently on my third week of sobriety from thc, I would love to talk to someone about our shared struggles.

A little about myself I am 23 and currently studying in Krakow Poland, I have been smoking pretty much daily since the ripe age of 17. I recently ended an almost 4 year relationship with a girl I really loved because of cannabis, I had to lose something very precious to me in order to finally get my shit together. She gave me an ultimatum either stop abusing weed or lose her forever, and I chose the drugs something I am sure I will regret for a very long time. I am also thankful for the break up because it's been a catalyst for change. 

By far the hardest part of these past few weeks is the anger I feel towards myself, that I couldn't take responsibility for my life sooner. I missed so many opportunities, flunking out of med school is the biggest, but also never fully committing to anything I did.  I became this master bullshit artist who could charm his way out of trouble, half assing everything I tried.    

Ever since I quite I can finally experience true  self reflection, before everytime I needed to talk to myself I got scared of what I might hear and I would immediately spark up. It's nice to finally be able to hold a conversation with yourself and I am trying to encourage myself to be the best version of myself that I can be. 

Its feel like I woke up in the middle of this vast ocean of thoughts and memoirs, and it's difficult not to come to the conclusion that I been quite the asshole. I want to forgive myself and apologize to those who I hurt so that I can finally feel dry land beneath my feet .   

I am very fortunate to have very loving parents who never gave up on me decide to intervene, the drove down from Warsaw  after I came clean about my problem. spending time with them has been a huge help 

I've been a part of this subreddit on and off as I've tried to quite many times but it's always been a huge help 

For you Day 1ers out there here a few things that have helped me get this far:

1) I've come to realization that the best version of myself is one that doesnt smoke, as soon as you do the same the process definitely take on a new dimension.  

2) talk with yourself, even out loud try to realize what you are try to escape from when you smoke 

3) Go for a run! I've recently started running and it's my new addiction. When I run I feel like I am fighting with my body the little pains in my knee or lungs and it take my mind of the urges to smoke.

4) try to change your environment I know that can be difficult because of Covid but spending time away from my daily routine has been a huge help. 

5) Ive been rewatching californication, its a show Ive watched blazed many times, but rewatching it and knowing what will happen has been helpful as is still feel a little foggy but I knowing the story relaxed me and i dont have to pay so much attention. 

Thanks for reading, and if anyone would like to talk to me via skype or viber or whatsapp I love to exchange some support!

We can do it!!!",9,1

Currently on day 33 without weed. I am nowhere out of the woods yet but I do not intend to go back to smoking everyday all day. 

The message I want to post on here today is that I have tried to quit so many times, it gets easier to quit the more times you “quit” but along those times I’ve consistently used this thread to help myself. 

Ultimately what I want to say is if you’ve tried to quit a million times and feel like it’s not in the cards for you... please do not give up on this thread even if you’re high right now, keep scrolling and keep reading people’s stories. Quitting it’s a long and hard journey but once you decide to “quit” that first time you’ve made a decision. It may take awhile for your goal to come to fruition but so long as you’ve made that decision to quit, do not give up on this community. You are welcome here no matter what you may be going through.

It helps you see beneath the surface of life, and insofar as that helps you, weed is good.

Now I've seen beneath the surface enough, and I'm struggling to actually live a life in the physical world. Diving deeper is just getting me further from our shared reality. I'm no longer ""learning"", so much as I am imagining things and believing them for a little while until I sober up and life continues. 

There is no long-lasting impact to the things I imagine and believe while high nowadays, so whereas once weed was a helper, I think now it's just a distraction. I just like the feeling of things ""making sense"" for a little while.

Weed showed me a world with colour and feeling to it. For this I'm eternally grateful, and maybe one day I will need its help again. For now though, I think it's time for me to put the herb down and make reality home again.

&#x200B;

There's no shame in having had a habit as there's a time and place for everything in life, even weed. Our struggle is to recognise when the time for it has passed and to have faith that something new will come to fill that dank green hole in our hearts that MJ used to fill.

During this time I also realized that I'm a much better person when I'm not constantly stoned. I used to smoke so much I didn't even feel high anymore which is why I initially took a break which ended up with me quitting altogether. I do crave that high sensation typically when I'm anxious but I also can't stand the actual process of smoking/vaping. But overall, I'm not dependent on it anymore and I'm learning to cope with my anxiety in different ways. It's also helped my memory and cognition which I didn't even realize had gotten so bad.

My dilema is that I forgot that I had ordered some distillate early in March and I just got the package today (covid delays the mail). Now, I spent about $125 on 4 cartridges and I don't want my money to go to waste but I also don't have my vape to actually use it. I suppose it's a good thing that I won't be getting high anymore but I also feel bad for spending so much money on something that is now obsolete. 

I promised myself I wouldn't spend more money on anything cannabis related so I'm obviously not going to buy another vape and I know it's illegal to sell it. But I don't want to throw it out and accept it as a sunk cost (which is probably the easiest thing to do... But it's a lot of money going down the drain with no benefit). 

I want to know what others did when having an abundance of weed while quitting, maybe it will give me some options and insight.",1,1

However, I have since realised that I have always been a deep thinker but cannabis only amplified this part of my personality to such an extreme that I became very introverted. 

I know that this isn't the most accurate test to source but [16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) is a site that utilises the Myers Briggs personality test. While smoking weed and even a couple months after quitting, I consistently got INFP. Which is to say ""introverted"", however lately, my conversations and drive to talk and communicate with other people has just become such a joy lately. I realised I genuinely love to talk and hear other ideas.

When I used to do the test stoned, the results were 70% interverted and 30% extraverted. A month ago, after quitting weed for a month the results were 55% interverted and 45% extraverted. Today, feeling empowered and with so much more energy and confidence than before, the results read 25% interverted and 75% extraverted.  

To me, this is such a clear indicator how much better my life has become since quitting weed. I am more confident, more open, more easily relaxed and can handle the stress of life. Cannabis was a great mistress but it needed to go and I hope I can continue this path. I am excited for the future! Today is the first time I am considered an ENFP instead of an INFP.",17,0

I'm really excited to be able to post here finally, but first of - English is not my first language so please go easy on me and on my typos/grammar/etc... 

Right before this whole coronavirus thing started, I was smoking 3-5 spliffs on a daily basis. I was hooked, but I always knew I wanted to quit. 

When the quarantine started I knew that I'm going to smoke whatever I got left and quit right after. I gotta say that it felt great, I've had more motivation to do stuff, I finally got back to working out, I'm exploring new hobbies and I've also discovered this place - hoping it will help me stay ""clean"" (no pressure) 

I've stopped smoking around month ago and for the past week specifically I've had a hard time waking up energized - my eyes are burning throughout the entire day. 

My gf suggested that it might has something to do with quitting, but I think it should've been affecting me right after I quit - so my question is - did this happen to any of you? When does it stop? Do you have any tips to overcome this situation?

I’m not sure what the goal of this post is, but I know I need to get out how I’m feeling. 

I hate this feeling of being restless, bored, lonely, anxious, and somewhat hopeless. I am at 31 days sober, and it doesn’t phase me to be honest. I’ve made it to five months sober in the past, but I always let my emotions get the best of me. 

I hate my  co-workers. They are the most gossipy and judgmental bitches.  Honestly, this pandemic kind of saved my sanity. The majority of the bitches got laid off, which gave me some peace. Unfortunately, my douche bag CFO is still with us.  

I hate not being able to get high after work. I always loved getting high on my drive home to decompress and forget about the day. I just felt happy and like I didn’t care. 

Getting high made me feel like I could be in the moment. When I start to think of going to a job I hate for the rest of my life, this dread and impending doom starts to over come me. I don’t know if I have it in me to not get high and be able to cope with work. My suicidal thoughts feel like they could creep in again. 

When I look in the mirror, I hate what looks back at me. I hate that my teeth are ruined from smoking, I hate the love handles on my body, I hate the acne that covers my back. When I got high none of it mattered; I didn’t care. 

I feel like the girl in the movie 13 going on 30. I feel like a teenager that woke up in a 27 year olds body. I keep forgetting I’m an adult. 

My sister recently got engaged and it made me start to reflect on my own love life. My social anxiety has really held me back, and I’ve never been in a relationship. It worries me that I may be alone for the rest of my life. I don’t see myself getting over my social anxiety. It hurts too much. 

I just miss the feeling of not caring, but I know in my heart I can’t handle weed. It’s destroying my life and exasperates my bipolar disorder. I worry about going into a suicidal depression, or becoming so irritable that I’m hospitalized again. That’s why I keep trying to stop; that’s why I stopped again recently. I started feeling very irritable and like before I was hospitalized last year. 

I don’t feel like some of the people who feel so great at the beginning of sobriety. When I made it to five-ish months, I still didn’t feel good. I felt better physically, but mentally I was meh and my anxiety was out of control. 

Right now I feel scared and lonely for what life has in store for me. I hope I can ride the wave and make it a year sober.

I'd love to say I'm gonna stick to it and truck on but to be honest I'm still rationalizing this in my head.  I really needed to talk to you guys about it.  I'm sure some of you are in a similar situation.",5,2
342,2020-04-22 17:36:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g69zbg/day_5/,Day 5,"I started smoking weed regularly when I was 17/18 as a form of self-medication for my depression and anxiety. I was hospitalized when I was 18 for suicidal ideation, and found that the meds they gave me mostly just dulled me, I felt like a zombie and the only emotion I would really feel was anger during that time. I decided to quit the meds after six months and since then I have been smoking weed almost everyday to make me feel better. I was buying weed in bulk from my dad and selling to friends in order to finance my addiction and was under the pretense that it was helping me, and to be honest, I probably would have killed myself by now if it weren't for weed. 

Most, if not all, of my friendships for the past 7 years have revolved around hanging out, getting high, and playing video games. I reached a point where I don't even know what to do when I see my friends besides get high and I found that I didn't even really enjoy that much, I would much rather just get high by myself. There's been times where I would wake up and smoke, smoke before work, smoke at work, and smoke after work. As I got older I realized how much I hated that groggy, tired, shitty feeling of being burnt out so I started to smoke almost exclusively at the end of the day, after I've done everything I needed to get done for that day. I would rationalize it as being no different than someone drinking a glass of wine or a beer at the end of the day and thought that made it more acceptable.

Once the government shut down all essential businesses, I would do nothing but smoke weed and play animal crossing all day. I did this for about 4 weeks before I got fed up and made the decision to quit. I wasn't feeling any better about myself, I felt like shit for wasting all of this time and failing to do anything productive and I was always ashamed to tell my therapist and my girlfriend that I spent another day smoking weed playing animal crossing. It took a couple of different attempts but I haven't smoked in five days now and almost immediately I just felt empty. My anxiety and my depression has been significantly worse in the past few days but today I actually feel good. In order to keep my mind busy, I've gone to exercising. I figured the quicker I'm able to sweat all of this shit out of my system, the quicker I'll start feeling mentally. I've started running which hasn't been easy because I've also smoked cigarettes for the past 8 years. My lungs are shot, but each day I've been able to run a little further and that only motivates me more. I do yoga as a form of meditation and to help my back pain and that has also really helped ease my anxiety.

The withdrawal hasn't been as bad for me as it has been for some of the other people on this forum. I've had trouble sleeping, I've been more restless, and have definitely just felt uncomfortable in my own body. My roommate still smokes and my apartment constantly smells like weed and smoked blunts so I distanced myself from him for the first few days and just isolated myself in my room, doing nothing but mindlessly lying in bed, reading, watching TV, just doing anything to pass the time. 4/20 wasn't a particularly easy day, but by that day I was mostly over the hump and didn't want to slip up and deal with the withdrawal symptoms again.

I've found that I enjoy the idea of getting and being high significantly more than I enjoy being high itself. I've also found that I actually feel significantly more in control of my life than I ever have, and I actually feel optimistic about my future as I research and work on applications for graduate school. I never realized how much weed was actually holding me back until I quit smoking weed and now that I quit, I only wish that I did this years ago. My job was a big trigger for me and being away from that negative influence in my life due to the pandemic has put me in a position to muster the mental fortitude to stay clean.

Smoking weed sapped me of any internal drive to improve my situation, it placated me and made me settle and try to be comfortable with my current situation, which was an incredibly toxic situation for me to be in. All the while, I thought this drug was helping me manage my depression but in actuality it just made it easier for me to ignore it. I'm seeing a therapist once a week and he has also helped push me to get clean, stay clean, and learn and practice new coping methods. You can make up any reason to rationalize getting high, but that rationalization is just your body and mind craving its effects and the more you resist, the easier resistance becomes.

Thank you to everyone who has posted on here, reading your stories has helped me stay away from weed and even now I can smell my roommate smoking a blunt and to be honest, it smells disgusting. Hopefully my story is able to help someone in some way. Recognize your triggers, recognize the negatives of your habit, recognize the steps you need to take that will put you in a position to overcome this and stay strong. We are stronger than we may think we are and we have more control over our lives than we may be aware of. Be the change you wish to see. I'm still smoking cigarettes to help me get through this, but quitting that is next on my agenda and I'm excited to take control over my life again.",5,1

Watching the sun come up, feeling the salt air, looking for fish. I used to enjoy this every time for 12 years while high. It’s a massive trigger for me to go fishing and not smoke. I quit once for 45 days and didn’t go fishing during that time. 

I’m on day 5 again and the weather was perfect. I started thinking about fishing and of-course the triggers came. I said to myself, “weed, you will not hold me back from something I love.” I have been fishing since I can remember, why should this hold me back? Well I went yesterday and had a blast. It kinda sucked on the drive there, but as soon as I started paddling, I totally forgot about wanting to get high. I was actually much more aware of what was going on, more energy, and no stopping for munchies. It was great. Triggers are hard to get over, but if you can, go do what you want and make new memories.

However, I feel this is quickly spiralling into addiction and would like to stop or at least slow down my usage. 

For people about to sag go to the doctors, last time I tried it was not help and obviously in light of recent events I won’t be able to get to the doctors for at least a month or two.

I imagine alot of people will suddenly be thrust into quitting weed soon due to lockdown so for what it's worth to anyone out there you're not alone. Here's an edited post I created a while back to make it relevant to today's new world. Much love and strength to anyone I've met so far on this journey and all those I'm about to.*

So I've noticed this place gets a lot of ""about to start day 1, y'all got  some tips?"" posts so I've collected a few here to hopefully help. Here goes...  

**Introduction:**  

First of all, well done. Well done for coming here and trying to help yourself. Well done for realising you have a problem and having the guts to do something about it. A lot of people stick their heads in the sand  and pretend it's okay, but YOU reader, clearly haven't. Kudos to that. And, I'm proud of you right now even if you aren't.  

First few days are an assault on the mind and the body. Big time. But it shall pass. And once the first hump is over with it gets easier in many senses.  

**Actual tip time:**  

**Caffeine:**  this stuff is bad when you're quitting (well, all the time really if abused, and us chemical abusers tend to overindulge...) So, if you currently abuse it to counteract the effects of the weed hangover as a  normal part of your day, start tapering down. Don't cold turkey caffeine  it's horrible. Try to limit the use to early in the day if you use it. That includes tea, and sodas with it in. Doing this will help ease any anxiety and help you sleep.  

**Exercise:**  Mega good. Just do it. Not only will it tire you (help you sleep) but it'll release endorphines and help stress relieve. It'll also keep you busy and will help literally sweat the weed out. Even going for a walk is good. Get out of the house if you can (and if it is government allowed and safe to do so given Covid 19) You are no longer a prisoner or a slave to your drug or thoughts so get back out into the world again, you've been missed! Although at a socially acceptable distance now please! If you can't get out. Do some online exercise classes. There are even more out there now, and a lot of people are doing this. Bonus point: no one can see you if you're rubbish!  

**Hydration:**  Key. Keep fluids going and try to flush the weed out. I'm not saying  drown yourself with water but you may get bad headaches if you're missing this step and it's an easy thing to miss.  

**Eating:**  A toughie. This can be a battle. I suffered with nausea and had no  appetite for days. So I drank protein shakes and water for the first few days. Your appetite may disappear for a while but it will return.  Nausea can be counteracted with ginger tea and ginger ale apparently. Give it a try if you're struggling.  

**Yoga / meditation / prayers / mindfulness:** Can be VERY useful. Give em a  try. Relaxes me a lot and helps me shut off the noise and grounds me. You may have a lot of internal battles coming up so learning how to overrule urges and bad thoughts should be a priority. Learn how to say  ""no"" to any voice or notion that suggests weed is a good idea and one  more won't hurt. It'll also help if you can find some positivity from  somewhere, as you get free you'll feel it building inside you so listen to THAT voice and build on every bit of progress you make. It all adds up.   

**Reading:** In the  first few days being alone with my thoughts was terrifying. So I took my  mind elsewhere til I felt normal again. So read. Read anything, it doesn't matter much what it is although if you choose something you're  interested in or related to quitting, even better. After a while I could  enjoy movies etc again but for the first few days that wasn't  happening.  

**Sleep hygiene:** Super important. Day 1 literally strip your bed and wash the  bedding and for the first night you'll have nice clean bedding which  should help you enjoy your bed again (especially if it reeked of weed)  Then set yourself a bedtime and stick to it. That means no phones, TV or  devices that can distract you for at least an hour before your set  bedtime. Nail this and the insomnia won't be as bad. And the sooner you  can sleep properly the easier the battle is.  

**Communication and support:** Find support (here is a great place) and talk whatever shit you're going through out. Sometimes you'll just want to rage but  you'll feel better after it. Read some of my old posts if you want a  laugh, I said some right crap initially 😂😂 family friends and even strangers online can be a massive help in stopping you feeling alone. You are not alone in this addiction and others will understand. Not everyone will FULLY understand of course, but people here will certainly  have been through similar so don't struggle on alone. Use online or  telephone meetings or therapy if you can. The more weapons you can add  to your arsenal the easier the battle will be.  

**Journalling  / lists / accountability:** I downloaded the Grounded app and in the  first few days checked in every few hours. Every time I felt shit. Or had an urge. I also used the check ins to write my thoughts down to get  them out. Not everything I went through and thought about I was willing to share with others. I still use the app to check in now although I do  forget (I totally forget since I first wrote this post, but it's still  there should I need it) Being able to literally scroll through my  thoughts and see that little acorn growing has been super useful.  (Seriously download the app it's free 😆) it also tallies how much money  you've saved and how far into each withdrawal you are so you can see  ""Oh I'm 3 days away from not being angry anymore"" 😂 😂 but I also wrote a lot of things down by hand. The first few nights I needed to keep my  hands busy so I just got some paper and went with it. I'm now trying to  improve my handwriting in the evening and I'm getting there! It'll also help keep you accountable too. You won't want to lose your trophies you  get for each day achieved either. Finding people to keep you accountable can help a lot too.  

*The lists side of things...* I wrote reasons why I should stop eg it makes you selfish, it makes you dumb, it makes you apathetic. And then if I  got the urge I looked at that list and remembered why I was doing this. I  also found a picture of some family and put as my phone background, to  remember who I'm doing this for. That helped a lot in the early days.  Now it's just a picture of the outdoors, something which I now enjoy  again as a former addict now I'm free. And can't wait to get back into  once this epidemic is over with.  

**Love, compassion and forgiveness:** This is for you. Give yourself these 3  things. You deserve them. You've probably fucked a few things up in your  life but it's not worth suffering forever for. We're all human. We all  make mistakes. And the sooner you can give yourself compassion, the  sooner you can forgive yourself. The sooner you forgive yourself the  sooner you can love yourself again. And people who love themselves? Have  the happiest lives and don't self harm with drugs....  

The anxiety, loneliness and sadness will pass.  

This is a tough time for everyone. We're probably all scared, worried and don't know what to do given the world we now inhabit but I feel so so soo much better for being sober for it. I'm still scared, I'm still sad, but I'm much clearer headed and able to fight whatever comes my way.

I won't lie the first bit is hard. But it is possible. And after that? Well I'll let you know as I get there...  

Hope that helps anyone who needs some guidance. And, as always, good luck and stay strong everyone 🖤🦾🖤

I just wanted to check in and say that I'm doing exceptionally well 1 year in, literally forgot about my 1 year anniversary yesterday and all about 4/20. All of my symptoms of CHS are long gone, and I've been really happy to finally be back to a normal life again. I was cleaning out my stuff this weekend, and found the stash of all my smoking stuff - my Pax 3, my glass pieces, my torch, all the random jars and wax containers... gave me something to think about. I'm sad I can't use weed responsibly or safely anymore, but It's just the way things go. I've been incredibly productive, feeling better than ever, and finally, feel the anxiety lifting of ""not being able to re-up again"". I cleaned out all the smoking stuff and sold it/gave it away to some old friends for some extra cash, so now my house is completely empty of anything. If I was still smoking during this stay-at-home time, I'm sure I'd be lying in bed all day and hitting dabs or my pax like it was air. Instead, I've been finishing up projects for University with the best GPA I've ever achieved, working on my car, and doing some gardening. 

Stay strong everybody - and congrats to all your milestones!

I just have moments where i smoke everyday for like 2 weeks at a time, then quit for a couple weeks.

I was a smoker for over a decade and I could say I'm on a roll, currently over the 100 days mark. I've tried to stop smoking several times but always found an excuse to go back. I didn't have any big problems with it, I suppose I was a functional addict, but in truth I knew that I wasn't living to my full potential and that though was fuelling my anxiety to the point I didn't have fun smoking anymore.

Anyway, I was looking for something different and had the opportunity to try psilocybin. It was a wake up call. I could reflect on my future a lot during the experience and that was the final straw to make a decision and start changing my life. I'm not saying that you should try it, remember, everyone is different, but it worked for me.

Fast forward to the lockdown and I'm having a really hard time. I was very determined to stay away from weed and did a lot of things to keep my mind busy but now I can't go out. All the activities that gave me a replacement for dopamine are gone. My SO keeps smoking and I respect her choice, but seeing her high and happy is killing me. My emotions are all over the place, I get angry at the slightest problem and I have sad dreams.

I see a lot of topics here about people feeling great after a few months and that really discourages me. I get intrusive thoughts, ""Maybe I'm the exception, I need a bit of weed to be happy"", ""I wasn't doing so bad, at least I was happy enough to keep going with my daily life"". But then I remember that everyone is different, and this thoughts are the last remainings of my addicted mind, and I hate them, but also they serve as a reminder that I don't want to go through all of this again, ever.

So maybe this isn't a success story. It sucks, but you just have to go through it, like any type of physical training. Again, everyone is different and maybe for me is going to take more time to ""get in shape"". I just go one day at the time, making sure that I won't smoke and trying to deal with everything that comes with being sober, good and bad, while I keep in my mind the final goal: being free.",16,1
355,2020-04-22 13:41:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g65mc5/finally_ready_to_be_done/,Finally ready to be done,"I’ve been smoking daily for about two years, very heavily the last 11 months. I’d say it’s rare I go more than 4-6 hours without some method of consumption. I’ve had some major ups and downs in my life and felt that smoking helped alleviate a lot of mental health issues and allowed me to function in society. It kept my anxiety induced nausea at bay, kept my stress levels low in my fast paced work environment, and overnight it seemed to cure my life long struggle with insomnia. For the first year or so I think these were all legitimate and I literally went from unemployable and bed ridden due to uncontrollable nausea and panic attacks, to business as usual and fully functioning. At that point I genuinely believe marijuana may have literally saved my life.

That medical use turned into abuse though after having an extremely traumatic mushroom experience nearly a year ago involving depersonalization. After that trip I was extremely anxious and nervous. I was paranoid about everyone to the point I thought I was losing my mind. I thought the world was fucking with me. I literally felt like I was living in my own real life Truman show. It was awful and horrifying and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. This went on for a few weeks before it began to subside, but even to this day I get the creeps when I think about it. I would smoke and it would help the heightened levels of anxiety and nausea after my episode. But then I’d get paranoid and have PTSD flashbacks like crazy. I found that a beer or two would do the trick and calm the paranoia. However, my already sensitive stomach would churn with the alcohol so I’d smoke to curb the nausea again. But then I’d get paranoid again. More beer! You can see the cycle of consumption I would go through most nights. 

Recently the PTSD has eased significantly, my anxiety is low, I’m in a good spot in life and every time I smoke I see just how much it slows me down. When I’m high I forget simple things, I put in a minimal effort, I get lazy, I sleep when I shouldn’t, I don’t play with my dog or take care of my fish as well as I should, my living space is always trashed, and I become dismissive of my girlfriend and friends. Amongst too many other things to mention. The paranoia hits and I need to drink. The nausea hits and I need to smoke. Drink, smoke, drink, smoke. Then the euphoria hits and I can’t get myself to stop until I’m blacked out and wake up shivering and vomiting not knowing what happened the night before or when I had gone to bed. Sometimes too hungover to even move hardly. Not knowing if I said something hurtful to someone I love, or how I got this bruise, or that scratch, or some bump on my head. Or even on a couple occasions, how I ended up in the middle of my neighbors back lawn or the parking lot next door. 

The cycle ends now. I’ve been smoke free for two days and as I become sober I’m realizing it really is finally time to be done. When I stop smoking I usually have really harsh withdrawals that start within about 8 hours. Not the worst withdrawals I’ve heard of, but the worst of anyone I personally know. Night one of sobriety I slept great, but I also had just smoked earlier that evening. Last night I slept extremely well too which seemed odd since the insomnia usually takes over by hour 12. Today I woke up and I wasn’t chilled, or nauseous, or achey like I ALWAYS am on day two. My cravings for alcohol are essentially gone. I wasn’t hungover when I woke up because I only needed one beer to enjoy it and then I could stop because I didn’t need to relieve my paranoia. I ate breakfast today when usually I can’t eat for at least four or five days, sometimes a week after quitting. The fact that I’m not withdrawing as I expected is incredibly encouraging! It’s making it easy this time! I only had a couple cravings last night when usually it’s all I can think about for a couple weeks. I hope and pray I stay on this track since day 3 has traditionally been the worst for me, but I’m feeling confident. I’m not sure why I’m not withdrawing this time, but it’s a relief and I’ll take any help I can get. I know I’m very early in my journey to sobriety. This is my first time attempting to quit and hopefully my last and only. There’s a lot I have to learn still and many hardships and trials that I’m sure I’ll face. I’ll have craving after craving and opportunity after opportunity to give in, I just hope I can stay strong enough to say no and find better things to occupy my time with. I feel like I’m rambling at this point, but for the first time in a long time I can see hope and joy in my future. I finally feel like I have the ability to become successful in my life.",9,0

I've been using daily or almost daily for about 4 years, with a few ""T breaks"" but never more than a month or two sober. It was sometimes a helpful coping mechanism for my anxiety and sometimes it legitimately helps me relax, but usually I smoke when I'm stressed out and that just makes it worse. Ultimately I feel like the effect it's been having on my lungs, my depression, my schoolwork, etc doesn't seem worth it. 

I'm debating if I want to try to completely quit. Lately I've been following a self-imposed rule of only smoking on weekends, and it's made me feel much better, but that's still a few days in a row when I feel cloudy and useless. I don't know if I should totally stop smoking or just smoke less.

The things holding me back are mostly the loss of my stoner community and the way that being a stoner has become part of my identity. I have so many friendships plus a long term romantic relationship, that were originally based on smoking weed together. I don't want to lose those relationships, but I also don't want to jeopardise my health and my career by smoking all the time. I want to go to grad school and have a fulfilling career, but that feels incompatible with smoking weed every day. Anyone have advice for maintaining friendships while trying to get sober? Or advice on moving on from the stoner identity?",8,0

I (30f) have been smoking weed for the last 8 years and I mean everyday, the only time I wasn't high is when I was at work, sometimes though I would even have a cheeky bong before going to work. I never slept well because I would wake up about 3 times a night and would have to have a bong before I could fall back to sleep again (first sign I knew I had a problem) 

I've had a nagging feeling telling me to quit for the last few months since living on my own but I've been ignoring it because I just loved weed and told myself it had no negative impact on my life, oh how you love to lie to yourself!

I've been in lock down for a month now because of Covid 19 and as you can guess I started smoking even more. Every night before bed I'd make a list in my head of what productive things I wanted to do the next day but I'd wake up say fuck it and hit the bong. This is how I knew I had to make a change as this is when I realised that I am infact an addict.

As I'm not at work and won't likely be going back for a while I thought now is the best time to quit, I'm not at work to get irritable and angry and I'm not surrounded by anyone to take my moods out on. So I smoked the last of what I had and told my friend who gets me my supply to not offer to pick any up for me. 

I had my last joint at 4 o clock last Thursday and I'm on day 6 of withdrawals and I have to admit its killing me! The first 3 days weren't so bad and I thought this was going to be easy but yesterday and today have most definitely been the worst days so far. I'm hungry but can't eat, I've been vomiting, I have cold and hot sweats and wake up completely soaked from night sweats. My heart feels like its going to beat out of my chest from the anxiety. I feel dizzy and have the shakes and cannot concentrate on anything. I haven't had much trouble sleeping although it takes me a while to drift off but I'm having intense vivid dreams. I'm angry and irritable as fuck! 

I woke up this morning to a random notification for this sub (never even knew it existed) and I'm so glad I decided to lurk. Thank you to the people who have posted your stories, you've given me the strength to carry on and belief that I can do this and that I can finally live my life sober.",79,1
364,2020-04-22 09:19:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g60yur/ever_since_i_started_smoking_i_stopped_reading/,Ever since I started smoking I stopped reading,"I started smoking regularly in 2018, which quickly turned into a near-daily habit. It was so exciting at the time and every activity on weed felt so fun and novel. It felt like a miracle drug, it eased my social anxiety and helped me be more relaxed and talkative. I was so happy to just get home from work in the evening, put on a chill video game or movie, and spark up.

Fast forward two years, I feel this has had some really bad effects on my life. While I haven't been a constant daily smoker, it's been enough to really shape my life in ways I don't like. One of the things I really miss is reading. Before I started smoking, I was an avid reader and would devour books about philosophy, history, and politics, as well as plenty of fiction. While I still read some on my own time (and still read for university), the time I spend there has drastically gone down and I feel so much dumber for it. Not only could I not read with all the time I was wasting just getting high and playing video games, but I also feel like my memory went to shit and any reading I actually did, I had god-awful retention of anything that I learned. This is not to mention how lazy I've gotten with homework and studying. While I still have good grades, I've just been doing the bare minimum and have lost the pleasure I had for my classes before.

Another area of my life that has been really affected by my smoking has been my social life. I've always struggled with maintaining an active social life as I have pretty bad social anxiety at times. While I mistakenly wanted to believe that weed was helping me in this respect, it was really making things worse. Weed made it so much easier for me to just bail on social events that I dreaded as well as stuff with friends so I could instead stay home, light up, and have a great time just chilling by myself. On top of this, I think it's helped make me a really boring person. Especially for the first year of smoking, I didn't *do* anything, really. Just spent so much time on my own getting high that I didn't really have anything to talk about to my friends. I think it's also increased my social anxiety and made me more self-conscious when I'm around other people. And now it's gotten to the point where I'll often start to just think about how much I'm fucking up whenever I smoke. It's gotten really unpleasant.

I'm in my final semester of my Bachelor's and I want to get my shit together. I'm applying for grad programs and I don't want to half-ass that like I've been half-assing my last two years of my current degree. I know I'm a really capable guy when I try and I'm tired of just checking out to chase a high that doesn't even feel good anymore. I want to really work on improving my social anxiety and getting back into the hobbies I left behind for smoking (like reading and making music).

None of these comments about weed are a condemnation of the plant. I had some really good times with it and want to maybe enjoy it in a more reserved and measured way later in my life. I think in a social setting, it's nice to hang with some friends and chill with a joint. But for now I think I need to take a year or so off and see how my life changes. I feel like I'm really out of touch with my sober self and want to work on life.

TL;DR: Smoking daily has led me to stop reading and trying in life (academically and professionally). Also really negatively affected my social life and turned me into a hermit. I need some good distance and time from the drug for a while to get perspective and change some things in my life.

369,2020-04-22 05:44:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g5y8eh/todays_the_day/,Today's the day,"Hello all, 


After 17 years of heavy use - I would smoke joints like people smoke cigarettes, 10-15 a day, a half O disappearing in 6/7 days, occasionally 5 and thinking nothing of it, the time has come. 
I strongly believed I could not function without it and at certain times I would agree with that. It consumed my life, always thinking about the next joint. I hated socialising as that took me away for my happy little smoking corner in the garden. My mind was set on a single track. I am so lucky to have good family and non smoking friends, who could see it for what it is a psychological addiction.

So today signifies the end of a lifestyle, the end of a mindset, the end of a long running and expensive habit. Today is the day I face my drug addiction head on. 
No longer to live in fear of drug tests before starting new roles. No longer living with the anxiety that my drug addiction may again ruin my chances of a good job - one of the most embarrassing times of my 34 years alive, being escorted off-site and losing a very good and senior position due to a drug!

I must humble in the fact, it has served me well, got me through some tough times and out the other end. However with all crutches, there comes a time I must learn to move forward without it, to be less reliant on a drug and more confident in the power within oneself to deal with the problems and trials of life, to realise a joint is not the answer nor solution to every woe of life.

Therefore, I begin today, embarking on the next step of my life. I cannot say I am a little saddened, however that is the nature of addiction. I can move forward now less worried over future job prospects, well in 3-6 months time.

I just have to remind myself of all this in a day, week, month, when withdrawal kicks in and I start to feel again.
I have never tried to quit before, it was never am issue before, it was an enjoyment. It's time to grow out of it and move onto a fully functioning adult life. 

A new life awaits all of us!",15,0
370,2020-04-22 04:38:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g5xiid/30_days_sober/,30 days sober,"Hi people,

It's my first post here so welcome everyone fighting the same battle. Today marks 30days of my conscious sobriety (both tobacco and greenes) and I felt like expressing it out. Been reading this forum for a long time, on and off, but lately, I realized that reading all the stories here is giving me more bullets to fire against any lows/urges that are constantly re-visiting me.

Long story short, been addicted for around 5 years, starting with occasionally 1/2 a week bongs to living high most of the time through the last 3 years. The last 2 years I was high almost every day. It was affecting literally all areas of my life. I am trying to get all these stuffs under control now, since I made the decision to not run away anymore. I managed to make around 2 months break last year that ended with the moment I just took a casual hit from friend's pipe in the park that made me get my baggy the same evening to start the cycle again. An important lesson for me there not to make the same mistake now.

So today, seeing the number of days I went through I wanted to share it with you. It's a constant internal fight with the world that the habit created but I know that it is the right thing to do, to be able to move towards the life I want to create.

Thanks to all the people sharing their stories of successes/lows, their observations and lessons learned, it is all very helpful. And to all of you participating in the same war - for a better self and more aware living - wishing you strength and energy to keep winning it. It's worth the effort.

I started smoking in college in 2006 and really started smoking heavily in 2008ish. Through my last two years of college, I smoked every day 2-3 times a day. I knew I was overindulging and it was causing other bad habits, but I had a really really difficult time quitting for good. During that time, I attempted to quit probably once every couple months. The longest I would last was usually 2-3 days. I had a couple pothead roommates and we all kind of fed each other. In spring 2010, I was in my final semester and I was smoking more than ever just to forget about graduating and what the hell I was going to do afterwards. I knew the party was over. Going from a non-stop college party to the Great Recession job market was probably one of the biggest buzzkills of all time. When classes were over on 4/20, I was saddened to realize that my friends would not be partaking in the celebration. As fate would have it, I had enough weed to pack one giant blunt. I smoked it in my bathroom by myself and I just knew it was the end. I knew that that phase of my life was over for good.  

The next day 4/21/2010, I went my first full 24 hours without smoking in months. I kept it up through the end of the school year. I absolutely destroyed my final exams in college and moved back home that May. Yea, it sucked, but every day I felt proud of myself for not caving and that made things better. The best thing I did for myself was **not buy that shit.** Can't smoke it if you don't have it. I always hated going to the dealer anyways, so not buying it wasn't a particularly difficult task. When I moved home, I lived with my parents and I felt like sneaking around and storing weed was just too much of a hassle anyways. 

As for what happened after that? I didn't smoke weed again for like 8 months. After that I got a little more lax about it, but I never ever went back to smoking daily. I might smoke on a particularly crazy weekend or something, but those occasions are very few and far between. I have at some points gone years without smoking at all. I genuinely lost interest in the stoner lifestyle. I ended up working a shit job but saving a ton of money after college. I put myself through law school and have been practicing for almost 5 years now. Now I will indulge once in a blue moon. But now it feels like a treat I've earned rather than a crutch I lean on. 

One of my roommates quit the next year. He ended up also putting himself through law school and now he practices in NYC. He's done very well for himself. The other roommate is the *last* person I would ever have expected to quit smoking. I don't want to sound like a dick, but he had just an incredibly addictive personality. He smoked the most out of all of us and he continued to smoke well after college. A couple years ago, he quit fully and it blew me away. He quit like it was no problem at all. I've seen him turn it away at parties like nothing. He's doing well for himself too. 

Hope this is a feelgood story for those that manage to actually read it and are thinking about quitting or at least cutting back substantially. If you'd have known us in college, you'd have thought we were a lost cause. The three of us were just on a constant smoking rotation pretty much all day every day. And honestly, I have a lot of regret about that. But I'd have a lot more regret if I had kept doing it. So cheers to a more clear-headed life.

Growing up, meeting friends was hard, really hard.
Through 1st to 6th grade was when my ocd was pretty bad, and I didn't how know how to handle it as a kid so I cut myself evenly around the arm every time I couldn't handle any more thinking in my head, my parents found out, and they sent me to a mental hospital for three months.
And I had a pretty good treatment, I started taking medication for my ocd and things started to get better, I finished 6th grade and I wanted to make a change, so I moved up to an art school in the City, it was hard at first, after being gone from 3+ months from society , social skills become pretty tough.
After a hard year I managed to find my friends, we had good times together and for a few years I was balanced with my OCD, in my 16th birthday was when we got into alcohol, and for someone with OCD alcohol was amazing, so I did it more than my friends, and it made things worse, my OCD has returned BAD and I really wanted to end my life.
But I managed to quit booze , and I got out of that swamp.
Again I felt better, later on that year me and my friends found Mary Jane , and I really liked it, things were better when I was high and better when I was sober, it made me feel good.
But I've always found a way to f#@# it up...
I invited my friends for a party, when they left one of the girls wanted to stay over, someone I had feeling for a long time..
When we went to bad I was really high and I couldn't Force myself from touching her breast when she was asleep, she didn't stop me even thought she woke up so I thought she liked it so I kept going, in the end she left and gave me a hug..
Then I came back to school and EVERYBODY hates me, and I didn't know why.. later I talked to her, and I said sorry for what happened but I was also mad at her because she didn't stop me, she was awake and she didn't stop me.. she gave me a hug in the end!
From that point on she made it her goal to make my life in that school a living nightmare.
She told everyone, and everyone hated me, all I had was Mary jane, it was the only thing helping me see a better day, but things didn't get better.
I lost all of my friends, I lost my school, I lost control.
I had to move out of that school, so I did and things became better, weed really helped me gain new friends and I found myself in a better place.
But weed does not get me high anymore, I can't run from what I did to her, from how everyone hates me, I can't stop thinking those repetitive thoughts that keep rise up again and again and again.
I can't stop thinking if weed got me to where I am , or if weed is helping me.

I'm 25/F and I've been smoking for about 7 years. Its crazy to think that it's already been that long.. I would smoke everyday, multiple times a day, from my bong. During that 7 year period, I managed to stop for 1 month, but got back into it.. I used to vape as well for about 4 years, however, I quit vaping about a week ago. It hasn't been that bad. I do have times when I think about it but not as much as I think about weed. It makes me sad to throw away my bongs but I know that if they stay in my house, it'll make me think about it even more..

So far, I've been watching the office on netflix and reading the /leaves forum, which I believe will play a big role in my success since I do not really have many friends that don't smoke. I plan on working out again at home, for now, until quarantine is over. Hopefully I won't experience too many withdrawal symptoms..

WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER! and together we will all come out of this stronger!

Any suggestions or advice is welcome :)

This is not the first time I have quit and these familiar shitty feeling are harder to conquer than I pretend they are. My usage started at 15 when my brother died and has been every day for the last 12 years. I needed to make this post so I could not only put into words how badly I’ve been towed away by this addiction but also let some of you out there know it could be worse and hopefully that helps. I smoke weed and tobacco together for clarification.

Weed was initially attractive because my older brother was always involved with it and it just seemed natural to me that it becomes a part of your life in your teens. The first time I held onto big bag of weed I must have been 8 yrs old. I also was diagnosed with ADD and depression as a kid before age 10 and felt like it was a better solution than antidepressants or cognition enhancements once I got to my teen years. My attraction was compounded by my experiences using it because it helped me think more clearly and calmly as well as lifted the natural weights I would feel from depression. So naturally I took a liking to it and never looked back. I went down the path of finding better and better weed and smoking more and more and more and as time went on legalization happened where I live and it became only more accessible and acceptable.

I was the type of stoner who would get my shit done before smoking be it work, exam, first date etc. I live an absolutely normal professional life but as I get closer to age 30 the benefits of having pot in my life are fading away. I felt like I had a duality in my life where I could be a sober functioning member of society during the day and then be my stoned self at home. 

The illusion here is that people tend to believe that they will always maintain the same functionality in each facet of their sober and high lives. This is impossible unless you enjoy being sober as much as you do being high which the brain does not. For me I graduated university in four years have always had a full time job that is at standard or above for my age/ education level. In short, I always felt like the old adage of pot ruining your life and ambitions just simply wasn’t true and felt like I had successfully avoided it and even positively incorporated it into my life as I went from a teen into a now 27 year old adult.

The thing I missed was me. The problem is that people like us always accept good enough for ourselves and don’t hold out for what we really want.

Ask yourself the following question and think about how you accept weed into your life:

In this life I have lived till now, is it my deep passions and desires to live life which perpetuated me to where I am today or has it been the selfish pursuit of self satisfaction that has made me accept what I have chosen?

Here I am after 12 years of everyday use through all ups and downs with absolutely no enjoyment or relief from pot. My lungs feel terrible, sobriety is like living a life without endorphins and I don’t really feel like I affect the world around me. This is the cost of my daily use and the reasons why I contemplate change. I am sitting here not wanting to do anything or be anywhere practically a shell of myself stuck In limbo till my brain gets happy on its own. I am practically just waiting to be refilled with all the passions and desires I swept away because pot was good enough. What I have learned is that pot is good enough to waste years of your life on and convincing enough to leave things behind which truly matter. I am making this post for all of you to know that despite the level of usage I have had, it is still well within my constitution to recognize it is not good for me and well within my control to change this regardless of how shitty it is in the short run. It will be a very long road until normalcy returns in sobriety but even the pursuit is worth it for my soul.",13,0

I've gone long stretches without smoking before but always had that whisper of an idea that I could just smoke once in a while. Well as ya'll know that snaps back to smoking all the time, cuz it's not that bad right? Why did I even go off it in the first place? The restarts are always innocent enough - last time I was sitting on top of a mountain looking down the continental divide & my friend passed the vape - so I know I'll have to look out for those. But today another friend suggested we smoke in our respective homes (cuz viruses) and watch a Hitchcock film at the same time. I didn't even think on it, just straight up no. I don't want to trade 3hours of enjoyment for a full day of depression (my weed hangover). I don't want to loose my thinking and memory for the next three days. Why should I need to augment a movie by The Master of Suspense? Why become dependent (again) on an escape mechanism I've proven to be ineffective? These were all implicit in my no. 

Now I'm really happy that my years-long self-improvement project is paying dividends. Sought therapy for a breakup I wasn't over. Constructed a (mostly) tolerable relationship with my parents. Found a new job where they're capable of adhering to their ethical duty to other human beings. I even found that a clean house is a clean mind for me.

I have plenty of work left to do, but being able to think about my problems makes them possible to improve; the ones I have control over, anyways.

Yikes.,"Hey, I (25M) had been smoking every day since age 17 with no voluntary breaks at all. This coming Thursday marks 2 months completely sober for me and I'm coming here honestly just to reflect. I don't really know where to start. Things haven't been exactly easy for me.

  The not smoking part has actually probably been the easiest part of not smoking if that makes sense. I had been wanting to quit for the last few years. I had tried several times but could never get around to it. Then one day I got home from work and was too tired to smoke. The next day went the same and I just never got enough of an urge to actually do it since. I've had roaches and a jar of weed out in the open the whole time. I just didn't have the motivation.

  The problem I have now (and I think it's a part of being under self isolation due to covid) is that I've been wildly stir crazy and my emotions are getting the best of me at times.  I am an ACOA (adult child of an alcoholic) and I'm only now starting to come to terms with the effects my childhood have left on me. I guess I had been in a bit of denial about it, and the weed helped me shut it all out. I never even considered the idea that I could suffer ptsd from my upbringing, let alone that it's effected me as a functional adult at all. Now that I have been sober for 2 months, I am starting to notice how I show many symptoms. 

  If I'm being honest, I've been feeling so lost and scared lately. I can't go out and see my friends. I can't see my girlfriend and that's putting a strain on our relationship. Lately we only really get to text and I've been caught in anxiety loops thinking she's mad at me, perceiving abandonment when it's not there and that was pushing her away. I stopped myself and have been reading and looking up ways to cope with these feelings and things have been getting much better for us. I've also been looking into trying to heal the wounds of my upbringing. I know what I really need is therapy but my insurance doesn't cover it and I can't quite afford it being furloughed (if anyone has any advise for this, please let me know. I want to get help so badly).

  There have been positive effects of course. I have more energy and motivation. I'm no longer content with just being bored. This has pushed me into pursuing more fulfilling activities like exercise and art. My senses seem clearer. I can breathe a lot easier.

  Like I said I'm more here just to reflect but if anyone wants some advise, especially for someone who has used weed to shut out trauma, you need to be ready to take on what you've been covering up. Taking down the weed demon is a positive step, but there are likely more behind it.

  I hope everyone is doing well for themselves during these times. I know it is far from easy.

TL;DR: Weed brain blocked out the bad goop for 8 years and now sober brain is taking the wheel and it's not looking great and I probably need help.",13,1

Also I’m not a native speaker, so I hope I’m able to adequately express myself, so everyone willing to read this can understand me!

Just in case [triggerwarning: physical pain, mental health, addiction, suicide etc.]

I’m a 28 year old male from Germany. When I was 18/19 years old handball basically was my life. I played in the a-juniors team of my hometown while simultaneously already playing in the first senior team. Additionally I was refereeing with my partner in the Landesliga and we were close to getting „promoted“ to even higher leagues.

That added up to 3 times training a week + 2 games to play and 1 game to referee a weekend.

At one next morning, after training, I couldn’t move at all. My back was exploding in pain. Even trying to lift only the little finger caused horrible pain from my lower back through my whole body. Long story short: I then spent ~ two years with doctors, every now and then trying to „comeback“ before the first doctor had the idea to make a mrt-Scan off of my back.

Diagnosis: disc prolapse. A pretty heavy one, but regarding to the radiologist not something that needs to get surgery done with.

I had to stop handball completely, which resulted in me losing a huge part of my life, personality and social interactions. Yes, i could and did go to the games of my former teammates and was always a welcome „guest“ at all activities hosted by the Society. But it didn’t feel as good as if I was actually a part of that. 

This was also the time I developed the first symptoms of depression. 

During the ~ 2 years of not being properly diagnosed, I was „treated“ with basically every pain medication on the market that wasn’t an Opiat. It didn’t take long for me to categorize these in two groups:

Group one: absolutely no effect. I could take as much as I wanted, didn’t do shit in regards of easing the pain.

Group two: actually helped a bit regarding pain but simultaneously fkd up my digestion really bad.

So I always had the choice between back pain, or a little less back pain but having to sit on the toilet the vast majority of the day.

So by the time I was 20/21, I attended the birthday party of my best friend. I never smoked before aside from a shisha/hookah/whatever you call fruity waterpipes at your place. 

Another friend offered me to smoke some of his weed. I never considered myself to ever use illegal drugs, since I was a „sports-person“, but since that was basically over, me being a little tipsy and depressed, I just thought „fuck it, why not!?“. 

So he prepared his (way too big looking, for my first time) bong, smoked it up and told me to kick it.
As you can guess: I kicked it. In full. I did see people taking bong rips before and they all kept it in for a little while before letting the smoke out again. Well, as you also probably can guess: that didn’t work out for me at all. After 0,5 seconds i coughed. And most of you probably know how it feels to cough out a whole pair of lungs full with the „good stuff“...

I fell from the bed where I took the hit because I got dizzy real bad and coughed like I invented corona and wanted to become the first casualty. (Trying to be funny here, yaaaay, to everyone who lost someone or is currently suffering from the health pandemic going on: I’m terribly sorry!)

Not long and I felt like vomiting. I crawled into the bathroom and got myself ready to puke everything out of my stomach into the shitter. But that, for some reason never happened. I also don’t know why but at some point I started laughing like a madman. Can’t say if it was about myself, a funny thought, or whatever. But I remember that instead of puking I actually had a lot of tears of joy/laughter dropping in the toilet. 

So... after the „initial“ completely being fkd up situation in the bathroom - and i can’t say how long it took me to get out of there again - I sooner or later recognized two absolutely incredible developments: 

Firstly I didn’t have backpain anymore.
Secondly I was in a so goddamn good mood, I‘d never be able to drink myself into.

From there it went „the usual“(?!) way: sometimes on weekends -> every weekend -> sometimes on weekdays -> everyday. In total i spent ~ 6 1/2 Years using cannabis. During that time I also tried basically everything else in the drug department. Just never touched h/Opiats, or crystals. But nothing got me as hooked as cannabis did, but probably helped open the gate for what forced me to quit cannabis:

After a breakup I moved towns and for the first time in my life i‘d actually be living alone. From my parents I moved in with my then girlfriend, when that was over I became roommates with some old friends, after that I lived with the next girlfriend and after that, like I said, first time alone.

I was making good money in my job so I basically created my own „stoner-paradise“ in a three room apartment in the „to-be“ area of the new town. It wasn’t far from my hometown and I already knew people there, so even if i practically lived alone, i basically never was, since I always tried (and succeeded) to have friends over.

I consumed 300€ worth of cannabis each month (can’t tell you a weight since I never measured, but by that time I had a really good „infrastructure“ built up and the course was a-fkin-mazing!) and felt like finally „home“.

It didn’t even really bother me that after a few months I lost my drivers license, after getting pulled out in a regular control. 

So after ~ 3/4 year there my first vacation came up. I didn’t plan to go on a trip, so I decided to stay home, well prepared and stocked up for two weeks. 

At literally the first day of not having to work I met my ex-girlfriend/fiancé. She came to visit me in the evening after we had texted for some time prior. Both of us experienced „love at first sight“ for the first time in our lives. It was magical. I know it sounds stupid/cheesy, but that’s how it was.

She didn’t do any drugs at all, not even drank. But she was fine with me smoking and that was completely new for me, since my girlfriend before always negged me for smoking too much.

She came by every evening after her work for the two weeks I had free and started sleeping over at night four or something. Me, being a fucking immature moron just couldn’t believe that she was so accepting about everything, which led to me basically ripping a bong head every five to ten minutes as long as I was with her. „Testing“: when is it too much in her eyes? When is she going to say something? 

But the only reaction I got regarding my consumption was something along the lines of: „why don’t you leave the tabako out? Smoking pure is healthier, no?!“ Guess what: I left the tabako out.

So almost two weeks in, she was staying overnight, there was another „magic moment“ between us. I won’t go into details about what happened, but in the end I (as high as somehow possible) literally fell of my couch, emotionally overwhelmed by feelings of love for that woman and asked her to marry me.

She said yes. And that was simultaneously the best moment of my life and my death sentence. You know, in my condition, it was too fucking good to be true.

That was the point of no return for my brain. Once again I won’t go into details, just know: sleep deprivation (didn’t sleep much during that time), psychoactive drugs (cannabis, yes it is, especially nowadays where every grower pumps up the thc percentages and doesn’t give a shit about cbd anymore) and stress (yes, positive stress is also stress) made the ideal cocktail for me to fall into my first psychotic episode.

Fast forward a few days: my dad brings me to a psychward, since I didn’t sleep since that day and my parents being worried about me at some point just dropping dead on the floor. After (can’t remember) I got violent with a caretaker there I obviously had to stay there. 

So, now let’s rewind. I’m engaged to the most beautiful woman on the planet, who knew me two weeks sane, but high as a kite. She now proceeds to take all her vacation days to be able to visit me every day in the psych ward with my parents.

When I got out of there, the most essential information was: stop cannabis, or something similar will most likely happen again.

Fuck me. I’m addicted to that shit. I need it for my backpain and my mood. So I go back home. My ex-girlfriend/fiancé moves in with me to support me. I can’t function properly. I’m depressed as shit, get nothing done while she is working and basically don’t contribute anything positive to the relationship.

I can’t say how long it took, but we eventually got in a fight. I don’t know about what or why, all I know for sure: it was definitely my fault. She is understandably pissed and says she stays the weekend at her parents and comes back next week. Heeyyyy, that’s all the reason I needed to visit a friend and smoke again, right?!

Once again, sleep deprivation, psychoactive drugs and stress: boooom! My second psychotic episode obviously was worse than the first. The police eventually kicked my door and brought me to the psych ward.

There I went completely nuts, I can’t even say how often I got fixated to my bed and forced medicated because I was so aggressive.

I also had to stay way longer than last time to get my shit together and - according to the doctors - was lucky to be able to get my shit together at all. If I was to become psychotic again, it’d probably be the last time, since I probably won’t be able to get out again.

That also was when the woman of my life decided she couldn’t trust me anymore, since I knew what could have happened when I smoked again and did it anyways. And what can I say... I probably wouldn’t even have stuck with me during the first episode. I still hate myself for me having to hurt one of the most important, caring, loving and accepting person in my life, to realize something had to change.

And i didn’t even realize it then. Obviously her breaking up with me put me in the worst depressive episode in my life. At some point I didn’t even give a shit about the possibility of becoming psychotic again and restarted smoking cannabis.

After some time I didn’t become psychotic, but suicidal. I had everything prepared to hang myself, but in the last moment decided not to go through with it, since my family did so incredibly much for me, I couldn’t repay them that way.

This was the third time I went to the psych ward. But the first time voluntarily.

I got antidepressants that helped and met a lot of good people in the clinic, some of them are friends to this day.

I gave up my apartment and moved into a facility for addicts. Up until now I’m living with substituted h and/or coke addicts, drunks, gaming addicts or stoners like me, but United in the will to live a sober life.

I started working again last year in December and am currently planning to move in with a good friend. At 7th of July this year I am two fucking years cannabis-free. I found a pain therapy that works for me without medication. I don’t take any antipsychotics for a long time now and plan to slowly but surely lower the antidepressants.

Enter weed. I'd smoked a good bit in HS (about 20 years ago for me) and took it back up about 3ish years ago? I started off light as it triggers my anxiety, but once I got on a good stack of meds for it I could smoke and have a very pleasant time. My problem is I only have two speeds: stop and frappe. Once I started I figured what the hell, I can smoke now, I'm an adult and can afford it and it's not harmful. To ""make up for it"" I mostly stopped drinking. So I'd just get high every day, for a while all day and when my wife raised alarm over this (she is not anti pot at all, she just noticed me way overdoing it) I sort of brushed it aside. I was still doing my work, making good money, and well... hacking a lot (legally, lots of paperwork involved).

Cut to 2 months ago, after several times of my wife raising alarm that I was overdoing it, we had a million and one major life issues occur. Our kitty died of cancer after a short 2 month battle with chemo and all, and then the next week our dog of 15 years died. He was our little soulmate and brought so much joy. These are just small samples of the life stuff that came up. To deal with it I started smoking even more, there were days when I'd to a solid 10-15 dabs. I calculated it and I was spending about 100 dollars/day to get high.

My wife got sick of it and some other issues we were having and left home. It was heartbreaking and right then and there I decided weed had a lot to do with her complaints about me. We own a business together, she was doing most of the work. I was no slouch, but my passion and motivation for learning had greatly diminished, one of the things she loved about me. I was always improving my hacking skillz, getting better and better and all of that had all of a sudden stopped.

I decided to throw all of my weed away, about 5000 dollars worth of it (I was buying wax in oz at this point), into a dumpster. Even with all the horrible shit going on it was like a huge weight off my shoulders immediately, as soon as I heard my bongs and rigs crack in the dumpster. This is when I actually started to really listen to the people around me, they all knew I had a problem and were all worried about me including and especially my wife who would find me passed out at any time of day.

For the past 1.5 months after most weed had cleared from my system I started to feel motivated again. My wife and I are talking and **potentially** not separating, I've learned more in the last 2 months than I have in the previous 3 years, and I feel overall pretty fucking great.

I realized that what had brought me joy at first had become a true monkey on my back, holding me down and holding me back. Before this I never believed in weed addiction, but that is quite obviously and clearly what it was, I tried to stop at least 20 times in that 3 year period and would make it usually about 10 days (I'd always promise myself and my wife 30 days). But id justify it as well, it's the weekend so who cares? or my wife is sleeping she won't care. I always found a reason as to why it was ok. Fact is it began to take apart my life.

Now I'm in absolutely no way anti-weed. I'm pro legalization and I believe strongly that it can be used in a healthy manner by people with more self control than me. I wanted to share my story in case anyone else finds themselves in this situation: sleeping poorly, low motivation, pissed off spouses etc.. In my case, the only way to quit was to cut off access to my connects (harder in legal states) and not have any on hand. Make yourself have to jump through as many hoops as possible to get and use it I told myself. And it worked! I have the occasional pang of sadness at not having a dab nearby but it's workable, easily.

Anyway half venting half giving advice and half just glad I found this sub (that's right I'm at 150%). Thanks for listening and reading all. Please.don't take this as a condemnation of weed, again I think it's a wonderful plant and the different strains and effects are fascinating and can be life giving. But be careful and really look at yourself if they are being so or being a weight on your back.",5,0

I smoked practically every night for two years when I found out it helped me sleep. My sleep issues stemmed from anxiety. As time went on I would use more and more each night and find more potent strains. This started to affect my anxiety in a negative way. I would have disturbing thoughts and felt like I was losing my mind. I quickly determined this was from my marijuana use after doing a bit more research on heavy use coupled with anxiety disorders. 

I’ve heard some people have success while smoking less potent strains and higher CBD but I felt I never wanted to risk anxiety attacks like the ones I was having ever again. I quit two weeks ago. The first 10 days were torture. My insomnia was out of control and my mind would race in all directions. I would get up and find a corner to cry in. Like bawl. I haven’t cried in that way in almost 20 years. 

I still have anxiety but it has lessened significantly. My sleep has improved. I wake up 2-3 times a night but I’m able to go back to sleep quicker. My sleep isn’t as restful so I get tired during the day. I speak to a therapist every two weeks who helps me with techniques to help my anxiety which does offer some relief and with practice I hope it offers more. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Can I expect to improve more?",4,0

My boss came walking in and said I needed to do a hair test. I told him one green is more important to me than another and walked out. The days leading up to christmas was terrible and really made me disappointed in myself for the absolute lack of self control.

I went in and begged for my job back. I explained that i’ve smoked for over twenty years daily and it would be hard to stop. I really didn’t want to stop. They gave me a second chance but put me on probation. A month or three went by and they never tested me. It was hell. Finally one night I called my dad over and we smoked a joint for old times sake. The next damn day I get called in for my first probation test. FUCK! Again I didn’t pass the test.... They did a hair test this time and I was good. 

For the next six months I got tested and was proudly passing the test. I had finally stopped smoking. It felt good. After a month or two without smoking you already know I picked it up again. It started like once a month and progressed to once a week. One night I got called into the office. I was extremely worried as to why but to my excitement it was to offer me a higher paying position in the company. I excepted!

Now going on a year I was working day and night. Non stop. I never had a chance to think about smoking. Then all this happens. No job and way too much time on my hand. It didn’t take long to consider calling a old friend.. but I didn’t and I won’t. I can finally say, over 3 years of trying to quit, I have and it feels good.",8,0

If you're new here, have a look below at what we're about. If you've been here awhile, please make a special effort to find posts without comments and give your thoughts so people know they're welcome!","Hi, I'm Subduction, the founder and a moderator of /r/leaves.

First and foremost, it's great to have you here and I'm glad you decided to come to see what we're about. 

Since how we act towards each other is the only thing that makes this place as special as it is I just wanted to take an opportunity for some reminders for newcomers and old-timers alike.

**Who We Are**

This is a subreddit for people who have made the decision to quit cannabis, edibles, or other THC products.  The only people we're not suited for are people who have the intention to continue smoking or return to smoking.  

That includes moderation management, tolerance breaks, ""I just need to get away from it for a while,"" or ""I need help getting through the next few months while my dealer's on vacation.""

It's hard for people trying to quit for good to have discussions with people who are still smoking or intending to start again, so we keep our focus pretty narrow.

**Who We Are Not**

The thing that sets /r/leaves apart from most of the other subreddits is that people come here at what is often the worst time in their lives.  They feel bad and have little love for the world or anyone in it.

So one of the few rules we very firmly enforce is that we are a *support* community.  We are here to help each other, creating an accepting community and a welcome place to be.  I know the rest of reddit can be rough-and-tumble, but that ends at the /r/leaves front door.

Even if you disagree with someone, if you are rude, dismissive, or any other flavor of impatient we will moderate your posts or comments out, and if you make a habit of it we will ban you.  

If you cannot find a supportive way to communicate with people, find a way to disagree with them in a respectful way, or guide people with what you think are wrong ideas in a gentle and understanding way, then you should not comment.

**Dealing With Problems**

If someone is trolling, seems to have missed the point of the group, is soapboxing in a way contrary to our mission, or anything else that might tick you off, **do not comment, and use the report button.**  That brings it to the mods' attention where we can review it. Use the report button early and often, it's really a help.

Again, however, please don't comment.  That just gives trolls more opportunities to keep trolling.

To keep modding from being too crazy we use Automod keyword filters that automatically holds posts relating to some topics for review by the mods.  We review every single Automodded post, but sometimes we can mess up, so if you aren't seeing your post and think it's somehow stuck feel free to message the mods.

**How /r/leaves Works Best**

The point of /r/leaves is many helping one and one helping many.  I know it's tempting to be a lurker, but unless we share our experience then no one has any lessons to learn.

Please post often and comment often.  Just the process of writing out your posts helps you and posting them helps others.  

We now get over **145,000** unique users a month here at /r/leaves so even a small participation can help a whole lot of people.

Thanks very much for arriving here, and we look forward to seeing your progress posts and great stories ahead!

I feel like I'm finally in the right headspace to go through with it, and yesterday was my first full day sober. My Mom and Brother still smoke, but thankfully they're supportive of my decision to quit. I've never gone full tilt into the withdrawals before, so i'm a tad frightened, but i'm trying not to think too much about that. I've had experiences with sleep paralysis in the past though, and my mind tends to linger in darker places, so I don't think those will be my main issue.

Needed to celebrate since my partner has never been a smoker and doesn’t quite get how hard it was/is. Each day gets even easier as I get farther away from my addiction. 

Some benefits I found:
-my memory is sharper
-I don’t misplace as many things
-waking up is easier 
-more energy 
-daily life chores don’t feel so sucky and don’t pile up and get worse 
-I’ve read more actual books than I have in a few years, not just mindlessly scrolling my phone 
-my appetite and mood are more consistent
-my house has never been so organized
-I have money for things I didn’t have before 
-I have a small savings
-my faith feels stronger and more authentic, like finding my true self
-FREEDOM: I’m not constantly evaluating my stash and how long it will last, time and energy And money getting more, judging how long I can be gone from the house or how I can attend an activity with or without green, general release of being controlled by a plant 

Some challenges:
-my inner voice saying “you’ve been so great, it’s cool to hit a bowl”
-minor boredom
-my mind feels active and no outlet for the anxious and worry thoughts (I highly recommend the app: smiling mind)
-withdraws the first 5ish days (omg rough!!! - lots of hot showers and rest and Netflix) 
-romancing green and my past chill times
-legalization in my state and the ease to go get some anytime I want 

Proud of myself for making it this far, one day at a time. Don’t forget to give myself grace and kindness. Everyday green free is a victory!",15,0

I really didn't expect this reception. This sub is absolutely great, and I wish all of us much strength to get rid of the mental haze. 

My first experiences with weed were great. It was a novelty, made me feel different, expanded my thoughts - I've always been inclined to philosophy and things like that. Made me feel my mind was booming. This kind of feeling persists sometimes when I smoke today. But I believe this is all a big illusion. You don't need pot to be creative, to have the ideas you have. You just have to sit with it and dedicate yourself, when you're writing for instance.

When I got into university I was very young at 17 years old. That was the second half of 2013. I smoked pot kinda often, but it really wasn't such a big deal on my life. But when word came to the uni veterans that I was a 'pothead', it instantly became an association people made with me. I remember my early semesters, I would be 100% sober at campus and people would ask me if I was high, and making jokes (not like bullying... friendly jokes) about me being high and looking high (I'm a quiet albeit sociable nerdy-hippie-dreamy type). It got to the point that it started to bother me. Can't people just look at me and see beyond that silly pothead persona that was imposed upon me? I'm much more than that, y'know.

Let me continue - I started to hang out with the potheads at uni. I'll be honest - I made good friends at the pot circles, in the hidden places at the campus. I really liked these inicial times. But the best part of it only lasted a semester or two. I was young, didn't care about much, it was a discovery time, 'let's see how it feels to watch that movie/play that game/ listen to that album while high' etc etc. Over some time I developed a daily habit of pot.

In the first semester of 2014 I got a really interesting opportunity for an internship in some hipster enterprise that was starting, regarding music and branding (I've always loved music, playing music etc). They didn't have an office so I was supposed to work from home. It was really hypey and I had been chosen among many candidates, even people older and more experienced than me.

After I got the job and my first assignments, can you guess what happened? That's right, I would just stay high at home, play videogames and whenever I was supposed to do my job I would just lay down in bed and feel like shit. I was young, I was silly, my dad is an asshole that besides having abandoned me and my mother at a really young age, beat me up really bad when I was 14, mom's got no idea of discipline even for herself, and my grandpa (who was always a father to me) had recently passed away, so I had no one to help me, to say that I was supposed to work instead of playing, smoking and being a little shit all day. No one to say that I should have grabbed that opportunity and kept going. I basically just had a shitty performance at the first month and I left the job. The hipster-entrepeneur guy who was the boss was really sarcastic with me, and to this day I feel angry and sad everytime I hear about their agency or think about that time. Angry at him for being an asshole, but mostly at me for being such an irresponsible kid. 

After that, things didn't really get any better. After grandpa died (which was a bit before all this job thing) - exactly the day after he died, I started a relationship with a girl my friend had introduced me to in a house party. It was like fate, just after losing someone so special to me, she came into my life. To this day she's really important to me even though we're not together anymore. I'll call her G.

G was a great girlfriend, really understanding and caring. But there was a problem - she was a really heavy drinker and cigarette smoker. As an anxious and sad young man I eventually became just like the fiend she was. We'd go to clubs every weekend, many times we'd do it in the middle of the week, get fucked up on alcohol and pot. Soon she also introduced me to cocaine. I spent most of the time with G, in her house, smoking a lot, drinking, ordering chinese food, watching things and making love. Then we'd find a party to go, and meet her best friend who was the worst cocaine fiend of us 3, and one of the saddest creatures I've ever got to know. Then the three of us would get really high and drunk and etc. 4 to 5 times a week. We were doing coke once every two weeks, sometimes every week.

Me and G, we were both lost souls, unsatisfied with our subjects at university. She was a cinema student, I was in advertising and absolutely hated it. But I didn't really care I hated it. When I wasn't blinded in love with G in her house, I'd be at my family's home, smoking pot and playing Counter-strike with my buddies talking on Skype. Uni was easy enough - I've always been a reader, and theory and research were always natural to me, so I excelled in difficult subjects, while on the practical side of things I was gradually being left behind. You see, all my colleagues in advertising were starting to choose their paths. Some went to marketing, some to video, some went to graphic design. I just lurked around, smoked joints and cigs and met with my friends. Absolutely disconnected from the actual reason to be there. I hated all that fakeness and superficiality that governs the world of advertising, plastic people, plastic lives... But I felt like I didn't have anywhere to go. I didn't WANT nothing. Didn't want to BE anything. My depression was hitting really hard at that time. I had absolutely no idea of a future. Around this time I had a course on music production, which showed me a new path. But I had absolutely no discipline to compose at home or actually study the subject like it deserves to.

That was basically how my life functioned from 2014 to around the first half of 2017. I eventually broke up with G. I left cocaine, but I was still drinking and smoking both pot and cigarettes. I still felt the same way. At lost, with no perspective of a future or a career. It was the beginning of a really depressing phase of my life. Where I tried to get shit back together but just couldn't. I felt so lonely I ended up in a relationship with a girl who had many personal problems, but she wasn't understanding  like G. We'd be locked up entire weekends inside a tiny apartment, having really loud and absolutely pointless arguments. She even spat on my face. But I couldn't let go of her. My self esteem and mental sanity where absolutely rock bottom. I soon lost some friends because she didn't like them. I spent a year dating this girl and working part-time in a shitty public sector thing where I'd just play Age of Empires 2 all morning. At least it was inside the arts campus and I liked to hang out there. Again, my company was the pot and the booze and the cigs.

After breaking up with this girl in the end of 2017, I started cycling a lot. It helped fight the anxiety and trauma. Sometimes I'd cycle really fast and yell swear words. Then I started to go to the bohemian district of town every night. I decided to not try to muffle my problems with relationships and 'love'. I got out of the last one too traumatized. I had my bike and my independence, after all. 2018 and 2019 I spent going to cheap pubs, made a lot of ""friends"" on the street, became kinda known in the street which is really funny. But yeah, all of it cycled around getting high and drunk. I fell into cocaine again, then back out. Got a job with brand design in a renewable energy place. Absolutely hated those burgeois shits. Got kicked out because I just didn't fit. Then I started doing freelance graphic design for some friend's clients. The income is pretty low and I constantly feel I'm being exploited. I'm paying the price of ignoring myself. I'm stuck to this fucking advertising industry. 

Around the second half of 2019 I started to change my mind. I decided to quit drinking when I went out at night. And it started to work. Going out became a thing about cycling and meeting my friends, and not getting drunk. At the end of the year I vowed to live for myself and not ignore myself anymore. Then covid-19 came. As horrible a situation as it is, it's been an opportunity for me. I'm proud to say I've been 20 days without nicotine and never want to go back to it, haven't got drunk in months and I am now dedicating myself fully to music and music production. I'm back in meditation as well, doing it almost everyday and having insights about myself. 

But I still. Smoke. Weed. That goddamn weed. I know I have to stop. Weed's been there sabotaging me and helping me sabotage myself for 7 years now. I want to remember what life is like without it. I need to... That's why I decided yesterday was to be the last day I smoked weed. 4/20/20. I'll be strong. And I'll change my life. Thank you for reading.",222,1

I will miss you.","For 3 months now I had 20.04.2020 marked as the date that I would quit smoking. So today (day after) is my first day sober in almost a decade.

I started smoking on the day I left school at 16, since then I have smoked (pretty much) everyday. Im not 25 and really stating to realise how much time and money I have wasted As the years have gone on I started smoking more and stronger strains. For the past year or 2 I have been smoking around 2-3gs a day and I’m just sick off the whole lifestyle. I figured out I probably spend between 5-7 thousand pounds a year on weed alone.

My partner doesn’t smoke and I know it affects her when I smoke, I don’t want to go out, have friends over, I just wanted to smoke and play PS4 all day. My short term memory is awful and I’m often stuttering my words and struggling to finish sentences when at work which is also embarrassing. 

I am not too sure why I am writing this here, support I guess? I just thought I needed to document it somewhere so I can be held responsible if I smoke again. 

I’ve tried to quit many times but this time feels different, I want to do it to improve my mental health, my partners life and improve my career. Most importantly though, I’m ready and WANT to quit. I will always love/miss weed but it’s time to let it go.

Good luck to everybody else also quitting/cutting down, I’m proud of you. 

I hope to update you all soon with my progress.

I knew it was 420 yesterday and despite some triggers on social media, I realized at the end of the day it was my first day without a real craving. :) 

Also my dog has been escaping over the last few days via some small openings in our fence. Yesterday she took off running in the woods (we live in a woodsy area but on the other side is a high traffic area) for a solid 20 minutes before we thankfully caught her. I ran as fast as my legs could carry me. I know that if I had been actively smoking I would NOT have had the lung capacity for that (I hate running) and probably would’ve crapped out midway and relied on my boyfriend (who conceded that I was in better shape!). ALSO I could not have done that chase high- would’ve been panicking and totally freaking out. Thank goodness I was sober.

436,2020-04-21 11:51:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g5hqa6/hit_the_one_year_mark_today/,Hit the one year mark today,"Has nothing to do with 4/20 ironically, that just happened to be the last day I smoked in 2019 for some reason. I had taken months at a time off in 2018 and 2019, but knew I would start again each time. This time, I had just started a new relationship, and for once was just candid to my significant other about how much of a problem weed had become for me.

I don't want to get melodramatic about this, but I want to share some context for anyone who needs to hear the harsh reality of how bad it can get for some people. I spent two full years living in a complete fog whilst working at my dream job out of college at a fortune 500 corporate office. Weed was *by far* the most important part of my life, but only my close friends knew that. I literally had no motivation in any aspect of work or life. Every single activity was centered around weed, to the point where I sacrificed most of my good qualities and character. I lied, manipulated, and got by doing the absolute *bare minimum* to keep my image even slightly intact. Long story short, it got so bad that I quit my job shortly after getting a *promotion*, making great money at age 25. Two years after I started with this company, I quit. The reason? Well, I literally couldn't say. I sounded like a babbling idiot trying to justify the decision to anyone who asked. I was completely confused in my head, and impulsive decisions were how it manifested for two straight years.

What I want to get across from my experience, is that I believe extreme indulgence in weed (as with any substance) comes down to self harming. I think that no matter how beautiful it is to be high sometimes, for us, it's really about the darkness, the anger, the depression, fucked up shit we're hiding from, etc. The shame that builds from living as a shell of yourself can be so intense that it makes weed a *necessity*, although we all know we can survive without it. If you are here on this sub, chances are that you've had these thoughts about weed for a reason, and you need to seriously consider that waiting to step out of your comfort zone could lead to something you couldn't have previously imagined. For me, it was simply admitting how bad my situation was to someone I love. That's it. The rest followed. Anyone you turn to should be 100% supportive, because if they love you, they will only care about you getting better. I encourage you all to think about one easy thing you could do to step out of your comfort zone, even if it has nothing to do with weed.

Lastly, I have thought about weed every day for 365 days now. The majority of my friends smoke, and I still see them regularly. Most are solid working professionals. However, I've watched some of my best friends go through a steady decline for years now. I don't judge them, but it honestly can be painful to see, and I remind myself that I was on that path as well. I see a lot of bullshit/fairytale stories about quitting, and from my experience, it just plain sucks. That's all there is to it. It is a situation in life for us that not everyone has to deal with, and maybe that's unfair, but that's the way our brains work! Be kind to yourselves throughout this process. If you're in the middle of the addiction still, there's NO SHAME IN IT. Look at how many people are in this sub. It's certain that the majority have not quit cold turkey one time. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading. If I can share ANY more advice or experience with you, or if you want to literally just type your thoughts to me, please just let me know. One thing that would have made this easier for me is to have had a completely neutral source with the same experience to talk to.

Please consider taking that step out of your comfort zone because you might be surprised at what follows. Good luck!",6,0

I've been a smoker for 14 years, and while it used to fill me with wonder and relaxation, and in many ways felt like a spiritual release, it no longer serves that purpose for me. It makes me feel anxious, guilty and paranoid. I can't smoke and complete tasks like I used to, I just don't have that energy, so it just makes me lazy and I don't get important work done.

I have the freedom to smoke where I want and when I want, I have dealers on call, lots of places to order takeaway...

I came home for the virus and because we were locked down, I stopped for a couple of weeks. After the first week is where I start to realise what a grip weed has on me.

I was irritable all the time, I was unhappy and slightly depressed. I didn’t want to talk to people, didn’t want to really do anything ‘valuable’ like study or workout.

Then weed comes back into play... boredom turns into ‘if only I had some weed’ or ‘it would so nice to smoke and do nothing right now’. Your brain TRICKS YOU into remembering all the good times you had smoking.

So what did I do? I made up a lie that I needed to go back to university to get some work done, and that I’d be back in a week. I wasn’t coming here to work, I was coming here so I could smoke again. I went out of my way, and had my parents drive me over an hour, just so I could smoke.

I won’t lie to you and say I didn’t mean to do this. The whole time I was on the way here, I was so so happy I could smoke again. I was fucking IN LOVE with the idea I could smoke a spliff again.

And you know what? It fucking sucked. I’ve been in a hole for two days, smoked 3 grams that was meant to last me a week in a day and a half. When I was high I found myself depressed, anxious, paranoid and everything in between. The feeling of ‘why have I done this?’ came back immediately.

And there’s the lesson. Addiction will literally have you LOVE the idea of doing it again, just one more time. Reality sets in and you’re back to square one.

I hope this is all worth it; I don't want to be an addict anymore. I'm on this subreddit by the night reading that others are in the same boat, and I'm just glad I'm not alone and others know how this feels, and that it is a normal withdrawal symptom.

Edit: The nightmares are coming. It was the most vivid, and most horrific nightmare I've ever had in my life. The same thing repeated 30 times 'when the demon killed me' and questioned whether I was back or just in the next repetition.

And every time I thought I was out, I'd return on my bed, make a run for the door, I'm slow, try scream, not a whisper, when I finally get up, the light under the door goes red, I'm transported to a van, with almost pitch darkness. The only thing I can see is broken glass coating the floor and a figure with an okay looking face, it would say 'are you scared of me' and any time I would show fear, its face would distort to the demonic face and it would kill me. Back in bed. Repeat. Thirty f***** times. One eye was seen shut and I couldn't tear out the stitches.

The last time I thought I woke up I ran to mum and dads room scream crying, they were like awh it's okay and felt sorry for me, then asked me if it was ****** that I saw and pointed to the wall, drawn on the wall was this thing. The same thing. And then I actually woke up (thinking it was the dream still) and here I am... This is reality again.

It looked like these two things merged (might scare some):

The last time I did was when I came off a 6 month bender of going through 2-3 (1g) carts every week and smoking about another 2-4g on the weekend. I took the months of Dec and Jan to abstain and everything went to shit. The withdrawal effects on my endocannabinoid system affected my CNS really bad. I'm pretty sure I had 0 psychological dependence bc I was super gung ho taking a break and I never experienced any depression/fog/dissassociation. But in terms of physiological terms, I was f\*cked. The severe withdrawal left me with autnomic dysfunction which basically meant my fight or flight (sympathetic nervous) system was always on.  I couldn't sleep for more than 2 hours without waking up in night sweats, my muscles began to lock up (esp. my diaphragm and jaw). Things escalated to the point where I dropped out of school and they were considering my graduation requirements. Hospital trips were a weekly thing. Anyways, it eventually went away, and I was back in full health. Stupidly, I started smoking again in March and I quit AGAIN last week. Immediately, I had the same symtomps (sweats, insomnia, indigestion, muscle lock up). 

But the weird thing is on the grounded app, when the clock hit 72 hours, my symptoms all cleared instantly. I don't know if i'm tripping or if the withdrawal is so tuff my mind is pretending that everythings fine.",3,0

This has made me a boring person because when my family wants to hang out, chat, or just be entertained I cant be as social/entertaining as I was when I was high. My cousins frequently call me boring when they want to hang out because I just cant keep them entertained. As someone who loves to entertain and make people laugh, it really sucks. 

I really don't know how to be not boring anymore. I just want to feel bored again so I can help my loved ones not be bored, especially in these days of quarantine. Sorry for my rambling, this is just something that has been killing me and I needed to get it off my chest.

Because I have made up my mind that the current situation, the past and probably the future are unacceptable and unbearable.  

What's the answer? Embracing it all.  The good the bad and the ugly.  Life is yin and yang.  It's not supposed go my way all the time, that's a fantasy.  But I couldn't accept that.

463,2020-04-20 22:59:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g57a6u/hello/,Hello,"Hi,

I’ll call myself James. I have seen r/leaves before. I’ve never posted on Reddit until now, and I feel like this would be the right place to start. 

I have a problem with weed, and I know I need to stop for good. I have been smoking on and off since I was 17. I’m going to be 27 this year, and I’m not anywhere near where I would like to be with my life. 

I was in IOP three times. The first time was for depression when I was 18, then at 23 I went back for another episode of depression. Weed intensified by depression so bad when I was 23, that I wasn’t showering, brushing my teeth, getting out of bed, and I feel ashamed to say this, but I wouldn’t even get up to go to the bathroom. I gained a ton of weight and let myself go. I was suicidal, and my parents forced me to go to IOP. I stopped smoking week for four months, but the lure pulled me back. I would start and stop, trying to moderate, but I would always end up going back full time. 

Last year my irritability and moodiness started to get the best of me. My irritability got so bad that I ended up being hospitalized for bipolar disorder. I was getting high at the time, but I also was drinking and I ended being put in handcuffs and in the back of a police car. I quit for a while after getting out of the hospital, but then I started again. I tried to moderate my weed use, and at Thanksgiving I started smoking. I told myself that I would stop after the holidays, but I didn’t stop until last month. 

This month, I started to feel my irritability getting worse. I was starting to snap and lose my cool with everyone around me. I do get extremely irritable after quitting weed, but it had been three weeks and my irritably was getting worse. I started to feel like before I was hospitalized. I called my therapist and psychiatrist to prevent myself from going back to the hospital, and they upped my dosage of lithium. 

  I have been to SMART recovery and NA, but to be honest, I hate group settings. I have had social anxiety disorder since I was 11, and it has very slowly gotten better. It doesn’t help that I’m judged for having a problem with weed though. I won’t go back to SMART recovery because I had the married-closeted facilitator hitting on me. I liked the concept but they are not prevalent in my area, and I don’t have any desire to deal with him. 

NA is a cult, and they seem to shun people who don’t follow their way. They feel there is only one way to get better and I strongly disagree with that sentiment. They remind me of church so much, and I stopped going to church for that same reason. 

My therapist wants me to try NA meetings again, but I hate them and they just don’t work for me. I know I need to find a way to stay sober, but I need to find something that works for me. When I quit smoking cigarettes and started losing weight, I found ways that worked best for me. I’m hoping that maybe this subsection will give me the direction I need. 

I guess in a nutshell, weed exasperates my bipolar disorder, and it ruins my life. I don’t want to go to meetings for the rest of my life and be part of a cult or be judgemental. I want to make it a year sober. I have 29 days sober. What should I do?

I made sure it was on the most significant and tempting day possible, 4/20. Here’s why.","“I knew right then that if I didn’t make a stand and start walking the path of most resistance, I would end up in this mental hell forever.” - David Goggins

I’ve been planning this for a while now, I threw out everything today. Donated the rest of what I had to a charitable cause, and could not be more proud of myself. I’ve been multiple-times-daily smoker for the better part of 5 years, and sacrificed my ENTIRE college experience due to this. I stayed home and went to a local college because I was too afraid to leave my comfort zone, and that’s a decision I’ll never be able to make again.

I’m a fairly regular Joe Rogan podcast viewer, and try to keep up with all the latest clips, news, etc. I’ll never forget the day I opened up YouTube, clicked and saw a new podcast featuring David Goggins. Interested, I did some research as I had never heard his name before, but figured he must be a pretty influential character given he got to be on JRE. I did some research, and 6 hours later found myself sitting on the couch in the same spot in absolute awe at what I just learned about David Goggins. If you have never heard of him, please look him up and learn his story, its truly unremarkable the feats he’s been able to accomplish just by pushing himself past his mental barriers.

Long story short, it made me realize that in order to achieve the growth I wanted and to have the life I wanted, I needed to GET OUT of that comfort zone as fast as humanly possible, and luckily I had been in that weird “when I’m high I regret smoking, but when I’m sober I just want to smoke” phase already, so I knew it was probably better for me to try and quit, I just had never thought about it seriously. Until 2 days ago. 

David Goggins’ book “Can’t Hurt Me” came in the mail and I’ve already finished it, absolutely incredible. To be as short as possible, his achievements and mentality on overcoming obstacles was the biggest influencing factor in my decision to stop today, on 4/20, for good. I wanted to make this a true test of character and I’ll be damned if I let myself fall short of this goal. To anyone who’s thinking about quitting, let’s do this together, let’s do this now.

Tl:dr - David Goggins inspired me to quit smoking weed and better my life, and what better day to do it than 4/20

Side Note: I understand there’s alot of criticism for Goggins’ theories on physical fitness regarding personal injury, however this is strictly using his mindset to break past my own mental barriers and hopefully help others do the same.",3,0

I’m now 23. For years I’ve been experiencing undesirable side effects from my marijuana consumption. When I was younger, I strongly recall being confident, outgoing, charismatic, sharp as a dagger, so much so that I was the most popular kid in school by a mile. But over the last couple years I have seen a precipitous decline in the functionality of my cognitive faculties to the point where I just can’t take it anymore. I’m not that energetic, eloquent, cheeky kid I once was and that realization has been enormously incapacitating to me. I’m now a social recluse. I feel anxious and self-conscious even while not high. As a result, virtually every friendship I painstakingly built over the course of numerous years has been dissolved due to my sheer absence and lack of effort. My mood is now typically one of self-pity and disillusionment. I used to have the memory of an elephant, but now I find myself struggling to maintain my train of thought at times. I just want to recuperate my brain function and feel a cathartic wave of inspiration and mental clarity wash over me. If I could go back and tell that fucking stupid 16 year old to never pick up a joint, I would, but alas, life doesn’t work that way. I now want to quit and experience the illuminating effects of abstaining from weed. I want my brain back. I want to do better. I deserve better. I’m DONE with squandering my potential and I know that this community can help me accomplish that. 

Now that I’ve given you some background information, I have a question for all you ex-stoners. For those of you who started smoking in your MID TEENS, ideally, what sorts of cognitive improvements did you experience when you finally quit? And how do feel,
mentally, compared to when you were smoking? I’d love to hear some success stories. You don’t understand how inspiring all of these posts I’ve been reading have been thus far.

All secondary to getting high. My life would likely be in a better place if I didn't smoke, but this is my journey. I am proud of who I am, even if I have made some really bad decisions. Weed let me know what I need to prioritize as I enter my 30s, and getting high is not one of them.",1,0
473,2020-04-20 21:35:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g55ye2/couldnt_have_done_it_without_this_quarantine/,Couldn’t have done it without this quarantine..,"For about 3 and a half years now I’ve been smoking weed and nicotine, whether it was from vaping or smoking pretty much daily. I started when I was just 14 years old just starting high school, I’m 17 now. I’m from NYC where weed is prevalent everywhere.. every kid and their mother is basically a plug for weed. I’ve also experimented with quite a lot of other drugs at an early age. Starting at age 15 till now I’ve dapped into DXM, alcohol, LSD, Xanax, Percocet, MDMA, Ecstasy and cocaine. Out of the substances I’ve named though I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve done DXM, Xanax, LSD... and weed, obviously. I’ve never really had any other problems with this stuff other than weed. Doing them daily I mean. I’ve always just had those drug phases. For example if I do acid I’ll binge on it for about two weeks and won’t touch it again for another year. For example I had no desire to trip after I had done 6 tabs of 110 ug tabs shortly after my 15th birthday. Which I mean I’m glad I have some self control ? Like I’m aware of the 3 month MDMA rule when it comes to rolling and stuff and all that. Weed on the other hand is a different story with me. My entire teenage years have revolved around getting high. 

I’ve flunked the hell out of high school, I was so behind in credits that it was best for me to just drop out earlier this year in January and get my GED. I was actually supposed to take the test at the end of March, but that got cancelled of course due to Covid. I’m not a dumb kid or anything, I’ve always been good in school up until I started smoking. I had no motivation whatsoever to go to class. The atmosphere made it no better. This isn’t relevant but I was one of the very few white kids that went to a primarily black school by the projects. The teacher already knew no one cared at all to be there so most the class had headphones on or would just go to sleep. Teachers were always bothered by this but they knew none of the kids would ever listen so they just continued doing their job to the best of their abilities I guess. I never had a problem fitting in or anything, kids there knew I was just some laid back stoner white guy at school. I’ve always been a likable guy as it is, I rarely ever have problems with anyone, I’m really approachable, especially in the streets I’ll just have the most random people walk up to me, my friends have noticed this as well... 

I have a very loving and caring family too, I’m not allowed to have weed in the house or smoke inside.. or have any of the other stuff I named before .. I’ve just always been kinda good at hiding it. They would be very disappointed in the knew the extent of my drug usage over the years.

for the most part. I’m rambling on at this point but I just wanted to give some back story of who I am.. But exactly 4 weeks ago I made a plan to stop consuming any sort of nicotine forever and to take a tolerance break from THC for however long this quarantine was going to last. 

Shit can I just say how fuckin proud I am of myself? Out of all people I never thought I would ever be able to stop by going cold turkey for 28 days straight, especially probably during the most boring times of our lives. I’ve always thought stopping weed by itself was challenging enough but after 3+ years of nicotine as well basically everyday? I’ve only ever gone a week without weed once and that was probably about 2 years ago because I was grounded, most likely weed related. 

For those wondering how I’ve been coping with cravings personally.. I’ve been drinking a variety of tea, I mean a shit ton. I’ve been working out at home everyday for about an hour, I have dumbbells and a bench in my room. I also have done some research with cold showers and it really helps, coming from someone who like steaming hot showers. I also downloaded the “grounded” app which has helped me, I check it about 3 times a day just because of how proud I am of myself... but Covid has played a humongous role in this. I worry for me and my family’s health.. especially when this virus primarily attacks the lungs, it kinda forced me to stop. I didn’t have the best lungs as it was, I would wake up in the morning most days and cough as I’m just waking up, almost like a 50 year old chainsmoker, just not as harsh. This has stopped after only about a week in. 

Once everything goes back to normal I don’t want to abuse weed anymore. This break has been more so a test to see if I have the willpower to stop. I plan on only smoking only after I have accomplished doing something productive. That was my problem. I would smoke for no reason at all. Why did I have a reason to reward myself? I would simply wake up and smoke just to lay around all day, just wasting my life away. Not anymore, those days are over.

Today is my first 4/20 yet without meeting up with my friends and getting high as balls, I’ve had to reject some invites today from friends that wanted to smoke, but I’m just not taking the risk of getting and spreading the virus and I have made a promise to myself that I would take a break for at least a month. let me just say I’m so looking forward to getting most of marijuana’s magic back when I take that first toke of the bowl. That’s what I’m looking forward to, aha... As for nicotine though I still think I’ll be smoking a blunt here and there, but that’s all. I’m done with cigarettes and vaping. I suffer from migraines as it is and nicotine doesn’t make it any better.

Lastly I would just like to thank everyone on this subreddit. You guys have really played a big part of keeping me motivated during this time to not give into any temptations. I love this community, everyone is very supportive of one another. I truly enjoy reading about everyone’s backstories and their journey to sobriety. Although this is only a temporary break from THC for now, this has been a huge milestone for me. I always thought I was hopeless and would never be able to do accomplish something like this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, stay safe!",2,6

I was never really a social smoker and did almost all of it by myself, I used to live with my wife but she never smoked herself so I just got high after work and went about evening. My wife left over a year ago and I've been by myself ever since, no real social life and mostly just console games and weed in the evening.

I haven't smoked in a little over two weeks, the boredom is crushing. The first week was rough, I couldn't focus and got headaches and just generally moped around. Now the fog is lifting and I'm more depressed than ever, I can see how shit my life is.

I have a good job but I have no friends. I have no hobbies. I have no interest in anything around me. My appetite is back and I've been eating more than I've eaten in years, it's starting to show on my body. 

I haven't felt the extra money in my account yet but I know it'll come through eventually. I just wanted to vent a little here, I don't really have a point to the story. This is killing me and all I want is my inebriation.",5,0

I’m 19 I started smoking when I was 16. I would try to smoke daily, even make my weed last as long as I could just to try and keep a “buzz” at all times many people say weed isn’t addicting but for, me it’s different. I would smoke the resin from my pipes every time I ran out of weed just to get that buzz. Drug addiction runs in my family so I’m sure that plays a big role in the outcome weed had on me. All the time I smoked weed I would always think about exercising and getting in better shape or just exploring different hobbies but I would always be like “eh I’ll start tomorrow, or when the time is right” weed held me back from so many things and I realize that now. I’ve been running and exercising a whole lot this past month and I’ve been going out into nature more and exploring new places just for fun. I suddenly feel like life is great even with all the Coronavirus stuff going on. But one thing I can’t wait to do when it’s all over is learn how to rock climb at the climbing gyms. That’s something weed would hold me back from just because of the social interactions and the anxiety it would cause on me. That’s all I have to say for now.

I got through it. I don't think about weed most days, and I certainly don't crave it. I do miss getting high sometimes, but I don't miss being an everyday stoner. I'm never going back to that. My life is better now.

I'm still getting waves of withdrawal symptoms, but they're milder with each month that passes. I'm looking forward to being fully recovered from my decades of use. Each month is better than the last.

It was sad to see that he had become what I was a few years earlier: a lazy un-ambitious husk of person only concerned when they'll get high next.    Seeing him like that reminded me why I got my sh*t together, because at one point I lacked any self control and it was ruining my life, my health, my job, my education, my friendships, my family, and my goals. 
If you guys are tempted today, especially being quarantined, I totally get it. But after a year of being sober I realized how much you can get done and how much you can change as a person. So don't give up, there's way more exciting things to experience than getting high everyday.",15,1

A foreign introverted kid dealing with a lot of emotional pain and barely any friends. I decided to start working on myself, started meditating, would have random conversations with anyone just so i could work on the skill and I also started going to the gym. All of this things helped me form a better image of myself. All this helped my mental image but not as much as smoking. The feeling of having a joint or even a roll up between your finger, inhale and exhale. All the steps of smoking, made me feel cool and accepted, I felt like a black James Dean.

I felt like I was doing something everyone wanted do but only a few had the balls to try it. My Self-Esteem sky rocketed and with that I was able to be more confident, and act more cool. I felt a feeling of being accepted by my peers but all this came at a price, the more I smoked, the less I focused on other aspects of my life.

Years have gone by, Im in little or no contact with any of this people who I so willingly sabotaged my true self for, in order for a fleeting moment of validation. 

Many a times, I have tried to stop smoking; to no avail but with each time, I feel I learn something about myself. 

And although I feel my exterior is in an undesirable place, unfitting of where i thought i would be in life by now. 

I have to say I would not change this experiences, this pain, suffering for anything else. This affliction has shed some of my arrogant mindset. Me being constantly irritated as taught me not to get pissed off at irritated people but to understand them, only God knows what they're going through. 

Knowing Others is intelligence; Knowing Yourself is Wisdom. Mastering others is strength; Mastering Yourself is Power.

To get ourselves to a stage of No Smoking is True Wisdom and Strength, it comes from knowing yourself and understanding your ego. And nothing worth knowing comes without sacrifice.

I built my adult life around this never happening. I'm closer than I've ever been, picking the last little soft parts off my weed stems and scraping my kief. The thought of having no pot stashed away at all triggers my fight or flight reflex, making the dozens on dozens of ways I'm ruining my mind, body, and life seem inconsequential compared to the relief of knowing I have a steady supply of pleasant white noise to fill the boring silence I'm supposed to be confronting.There's a dispensary an hour away and despite my better judgement, in moments of stress I know in my heart I'm going as soon as it opens up tomorrow afternoon.

In my mind I've still been smoking weed just because it's there, and when I run out that's when I'll really be able to quit. But then when I run out I have to go get more because the anxiety about not having the option is my real problem, and once I have it again I can relax and really be able to quit.

But after a while I realized that I had let me work go, had let friendships go, had given up on making meaningful connections with other people, and had neglected my own wellness for the sake of weed.

So I smoked the last of my stash last night and threw everything (pipe, lighter, and bag) away today. I’m committing to a life without weed since I’m allergic to it and can’t really handle being around it. I’m marking my devotion with a day of fasting, and will treat myself to a piece of cake if I make it all the way through, 24 hours without weed or food.

She was a regular user as it was her prescription for her anxiety. I liked how it made me not care about anything that normally worried me. “This is what it’s for...” I thought. “This is why it’s used as medication for people who suffer from this stress and anxiety shit like me.” 

I liked not feeling stressed about anything. Deadlines, exams, relationship troubles, everything would work out, I just needed not to worry about it. 

My grades never faltered, infact I excelled, free from the stress I normally felt before beginning to study for a big exam. “This is awesome,” I reaffirmed in my head. 

Now, two years later, I think weed is the biggest reason for my depression and anxiety, aside from myself and my decisions. 

I’ve spent all my hard earned savings, I’ve gained back all the weight I worked so hard to lose, and more importantly, I never had to deal with any problems. Smoking weed made them disappear, so I didn’t need any closure, I just forgot, and became numb. 

In January my dad killed himself. We had not had a great relationship for the year after his new wife told me he was abusing her and I helped her leave him. He hadn’t been into work, or called in, for 3 days prior to when he did it. I was at his house the day he did it, but I was too scared to knock. “It’ll be okay,” I told myself, “he’s a tough guy, he’s gotten through worse, go home, get high, and don’t worry.” 

I wish everyday I could go back in time and knock on his door. What might’ve changed had I done it. 

By the time I got back from dealing with his arrangements in February, Jen had cheated on me. 

I lost them both, and instead of processing it and handling it like anyone is supposed to, I buried it deep down and piled flower and pre-rolls and shatter on top of it. Anything to feel numb instead of stressed. 

I’m done feeling numb and being dumb. It’s time to feel the anger and the hate and the sad and move through it.

Do you feel that being quarantined was an important part of your decision to quit? Why? Was it because of access? Did it become harder to buy? Was it the loliness?

Yeah. I dont think this is making a lot of sense. Well I typed it, might as well hit that button",9,1

It's strange that this day used to be one of my favorite ""holidays"" and now it's just a regular day. I'm going to change the meaning of 4/20 for myself, from a day where I got high as fuck, to a day where I celebrate how far I've come and how much further I have to go. 

I'm not gonna lie, the past month of quarantine has been the hardest for me to stay away from pot. The dependent part of my brain keeps telling me that it would be a way to escape the monotony of every day feeling exactly the same, but through practicing mindfulness I acknowledge those feelings and ideas and I try to do something productive instead. I'm not always successful at distracting myself, but those times are when I take some time to meditate and recognize that it's okay to feel this way.

It's days like today that remind me that I'm doing the right thing and even though life sucks right now, it will get better. It always does.

503,2020-04-20 15:03:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g4yzf5/breaking_my_addiction/,Breaking my ADDICTION,"Hi everyone. 

First of all, thanks for being part of a community that is supporting each other in quitting weed - I've now found you and will salvage some support through the rest of the sub-reddit.

I'm going to quit smoking weed, which I personally consider one of the most addictive drugs on the planet 

I wanted to share my story, in the hope it helps someone else out there or something, but I guess I'm really trying to tell someone what I'm doing, as it it makes the world a bit less lonely. I'm going to try and keep this kinda vague as I'm sure you all know many of the details, but please feel free to ask. 

I've been smoking weed now for 10 years, and daily for 8.

I'm not going to say it's an evil drug; it HAS served me purpose and I wonder where I would be if I never tried it. 

I always suffered from intense shyness. I've always been the loudest of my friends, and noone would ever suspect I was shy. Weed helped. It helped me feel caresses, part of something, and it just slowed my thoughts right down. This was relief. 

Also, I started going to the gym 2 years ago, almost every night. I've made very little in terms of gains; but I'm proud of myself for sticking to it like I have. I used to smoke a small ""spliff"" (weed mixed with tobacco as a joint), drive to the g, workout, have another one. 

I started running last year - I couldn't run a mile and I ended up running 200 in a month. I pushed through intense pain on some runs. When I did my first half marathon (not against anyone, just by myself) and I'd always smoke a joint in the second half, when I was too sore to jog much anyway. These are great achievements for me, as I am by no means an athlete, and weed DID help o believe, but I am starting to think that's how badly addicted I was, that I couldn't do anything unless I knew I had weed to come back to.

I smoke weed every night. Ive convinced myself I can't sleep without it...sleep has always been a big issue for me.

I'm trying to move my life forward now, and get rid of the green lady!

Here's why ADDICTIVE was in caps in my title. 

Stoners always said - I said, they said, I'm pretty sure we've all said, that weed isn't addictive physically, and it's all in your head. Whether this is true or not, you best believe that mental addiction is tougher than physical addiction - 

I used to take cocaine every day. Every single day for 3 years straight. 

I've smoked since 16. I've quit both of these things cold turkey twice (slipped back in to them both although clean from coke since new year). I last quit smoking cigs and found a vape in my room, this got me way back in. 

These 2 things were so easy to break that by day 4 I knew I'd quit both, and by day 7 I'm no longer a smoker/sniffer and l never want to be again. 

With weed, every day I've ever not had it on holiday has been hell. 

But I AM going to do it, and if you're reading this, you are too.

I've got a little bit of weed left. I'm going to smoke that very soon, and then I'm done. 

I know that sounds really bad; just one last joint, but I did do that with cigarettes and I found it helped. I think there was a point from ""Allan Car"" (although not read it) where he said have your last cig and really observe it the whole way through. I've done this to cement in my head I don't like it.

My main stem of addiction for weed, comes from right before I go to bed. No matter how stoned I am, if I don't have the last joint RIGHT before bed, I'm not going to sleep. So I want to have this last one a few hours before bed, so I can still get SOME sleep as I need it for tommorow. I am seeing this as one last ""taper off""  as 3 hours before bed for me is still massively significant and already a victory, I hope that makes sense?

I hope that doesn't go against the rules for this page - I took it as meaning if you're only planning to quit temporarily, where I'm planning to quit forever. 

Anyway, thanks for your time, and good luck to anyone else trying. 

I've never really had a girlfriend, I talk myself that I'm out of shape or ugly or girls would find me creepy looking (I'm usually overly polite too) I'm sure I'm ugly etc and there is someone else for me - I'm not trying to get sympathy here but I'm just trying to express my honest self. 

but I'm really enjoying not looking like I'm part of the walking dead as my eyes are so baggy. I wake up feeling knackered with pressure behind my eyes, chain drink Monster or Relentless and start a vicious cycle. 

Please get in touch if you are struggling too. Obviously, I'm the opposite of an expert on this - as I progress I'll be able to offer more help but if you're feeling lonely on your journey, I'm here and we can do it together. 

Bless you all.",2,0

I found this forum full of people in the same situation as I am in, so decided to create an account and make the first steps to a healthier lifestyle.

Today is April 20th, and stereotypically known as national weed day here in America. But starting today I personally want to celebrate 4/20 as the day I quit weed. Marijuana has played a big role the last 5 years throughout my life during high-school and into college. I’ve made many friends, memories, creations, money and experiences because of smoking. I fully support the legalization and acknowledge there are medicinal benefits from marijuana, but like anything, weed can be abused. And with the world being under quarantine due to the outbreak of COVID-19, many people have turned to substance abuse during this dark time, just as I have. 

2 years ago I slowly started to notice that maybe marijuana isn’t good for me anymore and started experimenting with nicotine e-cigs and vapes. I was hooked on nicotine before I knew It. But I still smoked, telling myself I’ll do something about It another day. 
The last 6 months I’ve noticed that there really is no point to smoking this plant or smoking these chemicals packed in a plastic Chinese pod. But still smoked anyway.
The last 3 months I have experienced “greening out” and throwing up on 4 or 5 different occasions after smoking by myself. This has never happened in the years of smoking, but I think a hidden anxiety towards feeling bad about getting high overwhelmed me. But I still smoked, even after puking my guts up for an hour... Everyday I battled with myself. One half of me knew this was a bad habit that’s going to put me down the wrong path. And the other half of me continues to win the battle and tells me it’s okay to smoke, and do something about it another day.
The last month I have been determined to quit and created distractions by working out and making my own equipment at home, yet my aspirations to stay sober cave in and I end up buying weed and nicotine again, and again. I even get mad at myself and throw the vape away or toss the blunt. To find myself the next day digging in the trash to retrieve it and get a hit. 
I’m done being in a fog. I’m done letting myself suppress the true feelings of life, I’m done degrading my memory. I’m done being lazy and pushing ideas to ‘some other time’. I’m done letting myself and others down time after time. 
I am determined to to unlock my full potential again and take advantage of being in my 20’s, or being “in my prime”. I am the only one who can truly accomplish this, I even shook my mother’s hand and swore on her life that I’m done smoking starting today.",6,2

Not even from myself. In fact, I despise myself. Every time I talk to someone I feel like I’m insulting them. I feel like I hurt everyone around me. It would be better if I wasn’t even alive. What is it that makes us want to live? And what is it that makes us want others to live?

I have no one. Not even myself. I’m broken. What do you do with broken things? You throw them out. I feel selfish just being alive. I should just end it now.

The world is limitless. I can’t live in such a place.

All I do is smoked all day long and come up with philosophies because I’m afraid. I’m afraid of not knowing. These philosophies are just making me insane.

I’m slowly killing myself. I haven’t been eating, nor sleeping. I just wish there was an easier way out. I mean, since we are already going to die, what’s wrong with death coming early?

Just knowing that there are people out there who live in fear and loneliness makes me accept death more comfortably.

I care about people, but I don’t care about myself. How could anyone like me if I don’t even like myself? That is why I change myself. I change myself so that I can feel more comfortable with myself. But all that it has done is make me forget who I am. I don’t even know who I am any more, or what. But yet, I self pity. I’m pathetic. A disgrace to mankind.

Everyone around me looks so happy and stress less.  It bothers me. It really makes me feel even more lonely.

I’m so desperate. I hate admitting that. . But yet I can’t even talk to someone I know. Maybe it’s just that I don’t trust anyone, or no one trusts me.
 
Marijuana is the only thing that keeps me going and the only thing I think about on a daily basis.. 
However, since December I had 3 chest infection, bladder infection and no money. 
I told myself I would come out of my comfort zone and see if I can fight it

I spent 2 hours at the dispensary waiting to buy weed with the last $100 to my name. I would go home and smoke only to not get high because my tolerance was so fucked up from smoking and vaping multiple times a day everyday. I needed it to feel normal. My lungs were in bad shape, my grades were suffering, and I was destroying my health. I was spending so much time and money obtaining and using weed and putting off responsibilities and I was getting sick of this way of life I made for myself. A month later I would decide I'm done and started one of the many attempts to stop using weed. 

Today I am doing much better. I'm clean from my last relapse from flower for almost 4 months and clean from my last vaping relapse for 7 months. I almost relapsed on Easter but I was caught and I'm grateful, even if I was upset at the time. I actually have a savings account rather than blowing all my money on weed, my grades are awesome (2 As!), my lungs are good, I'm working on my weight (slipped up cause of quarantine but trying again), and I'm taking things one day at a time. 

I miss weed sometimes, but I know I'm better off without it. I'm going to spend most of the day offline so I don't see all my friends posting about 4/20 so I don't get in a funk and want to relapse again. Hang in there everyone!",48,1

I said, “Waylon, you’re doing good.”

Today marks 10 months since I last smoked, and I had no idea 4/20 was today until I saw a post about someone's first sober 4/20 on /r/leaves. I felt so liberated. The past 10 months I've felt the urge to smoke gradually diminish, but I still felt like a ""smoker"". I had to actively try to not smoke, and I saw no end in sight for this behavior. When I first decided to quit, one thing that kept popping into my head was how much it was gonna suck to not celebrate 4/20. The fact that I completely forgot about it, even during this quarantine, showed me that I am slowly leaving behind some smoker tendencies that I thought would be with me forever.


Quitting has been hard. Although I haven't smoked for 10 months, I am still very lazy and unproductive. I still have social anxiety. But everyday I get a little better, and moving forward feels so damn good - especially when you reach a realization like I did today.

Just thought I'd share. Been using weed almost every single day (concentrate mostly) as a way to cope with bad insomnia, depression, and anxiety over the past 4 years. I quit once in 2018 but that only lasted a few months before I started dabbling again and then last summer I, once again, began smoking every day thanks to some bad choices.

But here I am, one week clean for the first time in more than a year. I know it's 4/20 and all my stoner friends are getting high as hell today but no high can feel as good as I do now. My insomnia is so much more manageable, my head feels much clearer, my communication skills and motivation are way up, I'm working harder, my anxiety isn't as bad, I don't wake up feeling irritated every day, in fact some days I actually wake up happy!

I'm also 41 days off nicotine, 64 days clean of high-caffeine drinks, and I've been working out regularly for 6 weeks now. I'm finally being the person I want to be. Responsible, motivated, hard-working. And everyone can achieve that! We all have the idea of who we want to be, it just takes the first step to get started. Make that first step and the rest will come easier than you think!

So here's to a 4/20 being higher on life than I could ever be on weed. Thanks to everyone on this sub for the inspiration! Hopefully this inspires some people the same way.

I plan it so I don't feel terrible if I need to do something like hang out with family. That day did DXM and smoked, ever since I've aiming for the sober life. 

This wasn't really my desire, wanted to just quit weed, thought I could still do other drugs in moderation like drink a beer, and do a trip every once in a while But what made me want to stop everything is the withdraws, been smoking ungodly amounts every day since I got back into weed. Used it to quit drinking cause I was becoming a alcoholic, and I flip flopped between the three drugs ever since I was 12. Haven't really been sober for as long as I can remember, hell I've been on ADHD meds since the age of 3, think they gave me damn near every drug they could try to calm me down as a kid. 

Point being my brain hasn't existed without a drug in it for a very long time, I'm only 21. But I've been a addict since I could be a addict, which was perpetuated by my mom being a alcoholic and dad a heroin user. Had easy access to my mom's stash, brother pot stash, and thank god my dad wasn't around. We did have fentanyl in the house though until my mom got caught cause she overdosed and fell into a coma. 

The past week has been nothing short of hell, was able to put myself in a situation where at the very least I could quit pot due to the pandemic. Once my stash was out, I'm out, brain can fuss whine, bitch and wig out all it once. But their no way for me to get pot anymore, DXM and booze sure. So far though I want to be sober, I want to see what lifes like on the other side. 

Withdraws from not putting drugs in my body have been real though. I feel like someone took all the passion and desire from my brain and smashed it with a bag of bricks. That mixed with constant headaches, depression, crying really easily out of nowhere, very short fuse, disconnection from myself, nightmares, intense lethargy, insomnia, and brain fog like you wouldn't believe.

Think I'm through the worst of it and wanted to post something on Leaves, cause I'm proud. Think this will be my first time truly sober in my life, and I can actually focus on the passions in my life. What I mentioned in this post is only a fraction of what I've been through in my life. I've been set up to fail from the start, its a miracle I never took a opiate. 

Posting this on Leaves cause I mean come on its 4/20, but weeds also been a this innocent seeming drug where I can function on it and I have this illusion that I'm sober. Cause I'm only smoking weed right? But if your a addict its a drug, even if its not booze its just going to mask the issues a little better than booze or harder drugs.

This is my first serious post on Reddit ever, I've been a lurker for a long time (on some other accounts as well) but this time I really need some advice that no one else I know can give me (I live in a country where people quitting different substances are not really looked after).

As a background, both me and my wife have been smoking for about 8-9 months, regularly (roughly 1 roach every day, more so in the weekends). However, since the quarantine started, say two months ago - we've been stuck at home and since we both work from home we found that we can endulge in this activity much more often. So we've been smoking 3-4 times per day for about two months. Time which... was mostly ridden with laziness, procrastination and empty promises to each other that we would stop this lifestyle.

The party stopped about 4 days ago (that's Thursday) - when at 12-1 AM after smoking our 3rd I had a rather big panic attack. Heart pounding, couldn't settle down, nausea and feeling like I was going to die. Ended up calling the ambulance, and the guys offered me a pill to calm down and get some rest. That's when I knew that we needed to do something. So the next day I went and got some analyses and they all ended up fine. But it didn't make sense to me, since my heart rate was still elevated, and some of the panic attack symptoms were still there.

Since then, these are the symptoms that have been consistent: 

\- anxiety, feeling of dread, I get to tend emotional and irritable

\- stomach issues, both me and my wife. my stools have been rather watery and I tend to go at the toilet very often

\- cold sweats ( mostly sweaty hands and feet)

\- elevated heart rate

\- nausea every now and then

\- trouble falling asleep and waking up multiple times during the night 

I was wondering if these symptoms fall in the category of withdrawal, since I saw a lot of you guys have had similar experiences - if not for my peace of mind, I'm curious to know how long these will last, because right now it really feels like I'm stuck in limbo.

Thanks a lot and hope y'all are healthy (both physically and mentally) during this quarantine. Stay safe.",7,2

I've never been a cigarette smoker, but I won't shy away from a couple if I'm out drinking (which I'm sure is the case with a lot of people), but in order for me to actually properly enjoy a joint, it needs to have tobacco in it. What I find weird is that I have never ever had the sort of tobacco withdrawal symptoms when I stop smoking joints (i.e shakes, extreme irritability). Its sad to say but aside from a little lack of sleep due to lighting up RIGHT before sleeping, I don't really get withdrawal symptoms from not smoking joints.

The past couple of days, Ive put off smoking weed because I'm just doing fuck all with my time. Instead, if I ever get a craving I will grit my teeth and smoke a cigarette sober. Has anyone ever attempted this? Part of me worries that I'll just become a cigarette smoker and that will be easier to maintain due to the social acceptance. However the experiences other people I know quitting cigarettes has been a real struggle. Im sort of concerned that I'm making it easier for myself now by ignoring the tobacco aspect, which may be harder for me in the long run than quitting both at the same time.

I started smoking when I was 18, got addicted around 19-20, and I was an every day smoker for my last 2 years of college. I pretty much did nothing except smoke weed and go to work. I skated by in all my classes, and failed several that required attendance because all I wanted to do was stay home and get stoned. I actually stopped for about 4 months for my last semester (Jan-April 2019) because I was taking 18 credit hours and needed all of them to graduate... which I did, thankfully. But after I graduated I became more of an addict than ever. I got my first “real” job last fall and had ordered synthetic pee to pass the drug test because I didn’t want to quit again. Then every day at work I would crave weed all day and once I got into the car to drive home I’d hit my pen. Like a ritual every single day... I was high every hour I wasn’t at work. I eventually got so tired of spending so much money on weed, being foggy all the time and having no memory whatsoever, and being constantly worried that my job would randomly drug test me. I knew I wanted to quit for a while before I actually did, then on March 31st I used up the last of my cart and I was like, you know what? I’m not buying any more. The first week of April was absolute hell. I couldn’t sleep, had awful night sweats, was nauseous all the time, had painful headaches... but I stuck with it thanks to this subreddit and about 10 days later I felt fine and now I couldn’t be happier to not be dependent on marijuana. It’s still hard and I know it will get harder when the world opens back up because a lot of my friends are stoners and didn’t really take me seriously when I told them I was addicted and needed to quit. But today I gave all my paraphernalia away to my friends which felt like a pretty big step, especially on 4/20/20.",2,0

All I’m thinking now, is maybe I was deluding myself into this decision to begin with. 

Yes, I’m attractive (for the time being, let’s see if I can keep the weight off), but there’s—nothing—out there for me. 

I never understood extroverts. Beyond my poser phase as a high school freshman, I never wanted to be one. 

Literally, what’s outside? Traffic, foot traffic, people doing dumb shit to create traffic. 

What’s at the bar/club? Drinks exponentially more expensive than a trip to wine&amp;spirits? Strangers? Sexual competition?

Hell being inside during this phase isn’t the same. I can’t watch any of my comedies until this passes..., I can’t go to the virtual Los Santos beach and listen to my songs. 

And I was thinking about making this a permanent lifestyle? 

Say I do go cop/military. Wtf am I supposed to do on the weekends? Lobby for overtime?

I had a plan, find the most weed equivalent cigar in the world, become a wine aficionado, take up motorcycle lessons, and make a weekend out of long roads, higher end call girls and fine dining.

I'm a healthy 19 year old male and don't have any known heritable diseases or issues with my body. Perfectly fine blood pressure and everything.

I smoked on off from 16-17 and then 17 to 19 (just 2 weeks ago) I was going hard, every day or every other day barring a vacation or if I needed some time to stay clean around parents. Was always anxious about school and work and life but never debilitating.

I stopped 2 weeks ago, first 3 days really were shitty, I was getting headaches the same time as I usually smoked the heaviest (around 8-9:30) and they continued but progressively I've been getting better, aside from a little brain fog, vision fuzzyness (might just be all my computer time) and the headaches.

&#x200B;

**IF YOU'RE ANXIOUS OR A HYPOCHONDRIAC DON'T READ THIS PART**

Today, for whatever reason the thought of>! ""brain aneurysm""!< came into my mind, and It freaked me out, so I started looking it up and how it's a silent killer and it really hits anyone at any age with little warning, how your memory can essentially be wiped even if you do survive it, and they don't really know what causes it but they guess high blood pressure, smoking, and obesity. I've been a normal weight and regular blood pressure my entire life but obviously I smoked a good amount of time and it's really freaking me out, with these headaches, the stiff neck, the nausea, the on / off fuzzy vision. 

Even if there is a different reason for this stuff happening which my doctor and parents are certain it is, I can't shake the feeling I'm going to die or that there's something wrong with my brain and it's imminently going to burst. I've always had anxiety but never like this. I legit feel like I might die within the next few days now because my sleep hasn't always been great, I got all these weird ass symptoms (started when I quit weed) and while it seemed to be getting better today it got worse. I tried getting my mind off it with guitar and videogames but that headache in the back of my head still persisted. It's not a severe or damaging headache, but its enough that it hinders me from wanting to do anything or talk to anyone.

All I can do is worry. Is it normal to have this much anxiety? To feel like  you're dying or could die? Or is there something legitimately wrong with me? please don't tell me to go see a doctor I told my doctor about how I quit weed and he just said he's certain its the anxiety and put me on antidepressants, which i was reluctant at first but I quickly started because I will do anything to feel like a normal human being again.

I'm in my early 30's, smoked 1 - 2g a day for the past 10 years or so, came down with c19 symptoms which have encouraged me to stick with quitting which I've wanted to do for years.

Sweats, aches, tiredness, cravings, boredom, no appetite, all the usual stuff!

Just wondering if anyone would mind sharing how many nights they typical had like this before having a semi functional nights sleep, and if there's any advice y'all can give to minimise the dreams. Unfortunately I can't take ANY meds to help sleep due to having stevens johnson syndrome, and at this point I'm tempted to leave some bud in my vape and eat it once it's been decarbed, just to ensure I get some sleep to help fight the 'rona that's been wrecking my shit the last 2 weeks!

547,2020-04-19 19:56:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g4i9ra/letter_to_oneself/,Letter to oneself,"When you think you need it, when the switch flips in your head and it's all you can think about, when it feels like the only thing that will take the edge off, you can never seem to remember that afterward, you have the true clarity that it doesn’t actually help you in any of the ways you want it to. You don’t feel better.  You maybe feel a little more distracted and in your own head, and that might calm your nervous system a bit, but you don’t actually feel better, happier, or more connected as a person. You do feel more lethargic, socially awkward, and disconnected from your kids, who, by the way, are old enough and sensitive enough that they are starting to notice the inconsistency and shifts in your behavior. 

It’s so easy to think that weed will help you feel better, that it will take the edge off, enhance the vibe, make you feel more carefree and playful, more creative, but it won't. And, truth be told, it wouldn’t be that big of a deal,  IF you could moderate it. If you could not smoke it every night (and day), then perhaps you could use it in a way that was less destructive and isolating for you.  But you cant. You are addicted in the most classic sense, complete with the delusion and regret. You keep thinking “this time I can find a balance”, but you’ve tried this over and over. You’ve been through this. You somehow know this to be true with crystal clarity when it comes to cigarettes. You know deep in your being that you can’t have even a drag of a cigarette, or you’ll slowly but inevitably become a smoker again. It may take months of incremental increases, but you’ll eventually be right back in the thick of it, smoking a pack a day. And so you steer clear with absolute clarity about that.  Why can’t you see that your relationship with weed works the same way? 

Feeling like you need to get high and self-medicate? Just take a moment and think about what you REALLY are needing right now. It may be to relax, to feel heard by someone, to feel present, creative, comfortable. But think about what it is you’re truly needing at this moment, and ask yourself if weed actually delivers what it is you are truly needing? The truth is,  weed doesn’t fix any of those things, it just distracts you from the deeper yearnings while creating disconnection and dysfunction in your personal and professional life.

This is a vestigial behavior, like wings on a penguin, an artifact or remnant from a previous version of yourself. At one point, the chemistry seemed to work for you. Maybe your chemistry changed after years and years of hitting those neuroreceptors over and over. Or maybe you now simply have a clearer awareness than you did before of your own patterns and larger desires.

The catch is always: If only you could remember how you feel right now. You wanted it, you needed it, convinced that it would help you feel better. And now, even immediately afterward, you know it was a mirage. And you've been going around and around in this way, for years, unwilling to take a hard look and make a change.

Don't get me wrong, you have your reasons: A very stressful home life, chronic inflammatory bowel disease (which, to be fair, it does help calm down in the short term), anxiety, and a life as a professional musician, for which it sometimes seems to be a pre-requisite.  But none of those things truly benefit from your behavior.   You're less connected to your family, your gut feels better in the short term, but you can't control your eating, and that takes a larger toll on you than the relief it provides at the moment, you're more anxious and paranoid, and your music isn't any more creative or engaged, let alone your connection with other musicians or the crowd.   

Try this: Think about the relationships you want to have with your kids, with your wife, with your home.  Know that it won’t come from here, that it will take more than repeating the same pattern which has proven ineffective.  It won't be easy, much of your will has atrophied, most of your creative endeavors have suffered and gone stagnant, many of your relationships have been irrevocably influenced by this dynamic. But you can't change what has been. All you can do is work with what you know now, and what you want for the future. 

I know many of you on this sub have been on the same Ferris wheel of delusion and stagnation as I have.  I’m 41 and have spent more of my life as a daily smoker than not. At some point, the script flipped without me noticing, and I’ve spent the last many years trying to convince myself that its still as it once was, or, even more enticing, that it is for you, as it seems to be for others: creative, expansive, connective.  But it’s not that way anymore for you.  Like many relationships, this one has run its course, and it’s time to write a new story of you.

 Bud -
 
We’ve been bud’s for so long that it’s hard to have this talk – but that’s just it, it’s been too long, 8 years daily to be exact. So let’s call this a best wishes letter instead of a see ya’ later letter.. The hard fact is I’m starting to sit in myself instead of by myself and that’s made me realize I need a break from my once ‘forever friend’. I’m sorry bud. I’ve always felt that you and I were meant to be. I mean this not in the yeahhhhhh going to be a pothead for the rest of my life and call it alternative kind of way. I mean it instead as the act of getting high brought out another layer of me, usually what felt like an easier to deal with life kind of attitude. Tell me who wouldn’t want that bliss forever? 

The difference now is that I’m ready to take on the challenge of recreating that calmness within my own reality. The present moment. Without the use of facilitators, or what I now identify as medicating on carelessness. In a summed-up fashion getting high on its own has lost its appeal to me. I got so high, to feel so low. Yes, the initial rush of calmness is something to easily make me want to cave back in, but to receive that same vibration organically on my yoga mat is something I truly learned to appreciate. Today I focused on the warming sensation of tea in my belly, the cleansing feeling of sunlight through the blinds, the grounding energy between my physical body and the mat, oh and the sounds... especially in Florida the sounds are delightful, so many birds, so much to be grateful for. I realize I can return to this feeling anywhere, anytime. 

There is no plug needed to get plugged into the beauty of life! Its only been 3 days but I now see what I masked smoking for… let me smoke so this taste better, let me smoke so this is funnier, let me smoke so everything can feel one level up from its form. That makes the withdrawals a little heavier… it causes a craving in you to do it, just to subside the cold sweats, the lack of sleep, the boredom. I remind myself though that there can be no cheat day for the soul <3
 
Tomorrow will be the first 4/20 I won’t be celebrating with copious amounts of flower. I feel weirdly excited, like it’s my first milestone. Cheers to this new life, I can see colors again.

And thank you to this community, it feels like a giant hug to read some of your stories..",10,1

This quarantine has impacted my exercise routine (which was huge for me the first 3 months), but since I'm not a lazy-ass stoner, I have kept my diet super healthy and my body feels great. I'm eating mostly fruits, nuts, veggies, beans, with the occasional meat and carb binge. No sweets or candy, but that's just a personal thing. 
My mind is sharp! I dont trail off mid-sentence anymore, no struggling to find synonyms for common words, no public speaking anxiety. My memory is improving a lot, but i still have some frustration around that.
My relationship is the best it's been in years. We quit on the same day. We are being affectionate, spending meaningful time together, challenging and supporting one another. I was able to quit another addiction that was putting a lot of space between us about 35 days ago (you can probably guess), so I'm looking forward to an improved sex life.
I'm confident. Stepping up for projects at work, direct reports thanking me for all of the attention I'm giving (I've seen 3 team members promoted over the past two months-always my proudest professional accomplishments). 
I've been playing video games about 5 hours a week. Super fun! When I get bored, I just shut it off and go outside. 
Things are good, y'all. No cravings, but I do occasionally still romanticize the idea and especially the memories. Covid quarantine has exacerbated this. Keep thinking that working from home or lounging stones would somehow be ""fun"". I know logically this hasn't been about ""fun"" for me in YEARS. 
Meditation is my biggest blessing/coping skill/passion lately. It's so amazing to just spend 10 minutes looking inward silently. When I started, the anxiety of even 45 seconds alone with my thoughts was completely paralyzing. I keep allowing these anxieties to go on and learning from them slowly. 
Keep it up! And to all the new folks, welcome--i hope my post provides some insight on what to expect in a few months.",19,3

First off, before I started smoking I was a super happy, imaginative, creative boy and I thought very highly of myself. I also was working out like crazy and was gaining weight very easily, I had my dream girlfriend and everything was amazing.

Once we broke up I was really shocked bc she was my first girlfriend and the next day I smoked for the first time and fast forward 2 years later, here I am.

It used to be really bad, I would smoke every single day and that’s all I could think about and I made new stoner friends and they were all I could hangout with.

Now I’ve gotten a little better but I’m started to see some terrible side effects. I feel like I go through a cycle. 1 week, I’ll be super productive like my old self, and I’ll workout everyday and go on long bike rides and just do spontaneous fun stuff with my good friends, then, out of nowhere I decide to go buy a couple grams and I’ll just smoke everyday until it runs out, which also brings back my masturbation problem when I smoke. Plus my straight A’s honors grades went down the drain. 

Obviously I like my productive side better, but when I’m sober, I noticed I sometimes stutter and I’m always anxious, which used to not be a problem. I have super low self esteem Sometimes and think everyone looks down on me. I sometimes mix up my words and act kinda awkward. But I’m usually not this person and very expressive! I know it’s weed and the jacking off that is causing this problem but I feel like I’m just going on a loop and I don’t know how to stop. 

Sorry this was kinda a ramble but I just want it to stop and to get back to my old self.

Edit: I also feel like I have absolutely no self esteem. I tell myself I’m not gonna jerk off or smoke one day and I just do it, I can’t hold back.

Edit: there are certain days when I feel amazing and everything’s goin my way. I’m not depressed either",15,0

You were there for me when I was struggling with depression and anxiety from years of childhood abuse. 

You helped me be extremely creative. 

You showed me how to love everyone and everything. 

You gave me lifelong friends, and memories with them that are a part of my foundation. 

We have sat in many spots in nature, looking at breathtaking views while contemplating our entire life and being grateful we were alive.

You helped me understand myself and helped me learn to love myself. 

Some of the most intense bouts of laughter have happened because of you. 


Then our relationship stopped... I had to let you go so I could join the military and I have to say, my friend, I felt amazing while we were apart. But then, after the military, we found each other embracing yet again. 

I needed you for guidance, to cope, to feel happiness again. 

You showed me these things... for a little while. You were always one step ahead, you knew that our time was past and that you no longer had anything to show me, so instead of giving me gifts, you held a mirror to my face everyday, forcing me to see my flaws. 

But, I kept you in my grasp, despite the fact I’d used all your love and wisdom up. We were no longer friends as Our relationship turned into abuse... and it was me abusing you. I always saw the downturn I was taking in life because I couldn’t let go of you, and everything around me began to fade away. 

I no longer had a good memory.

I no longer had a burning passion inside of me, for anything. 

I no longer could hold my concentration on anything other than video games or doing nothing. 

I allowed myself to rely on you for my own happiness. 

I let million dollar ideas evaporate into thin air, and blamed it on everything but me. 



When we first met, we were inseparable for 3 years, I even found other friends that only further ruined who I was, and your love and wisdom was clouded from the love I received from cocaine, molly, acid, and copious amounts of alcohol. 



It’s now been 4 years together since the military and I now understand what I have to do. Tomorrow is your birthday and I am sorry my love, but, we won’t be seeing each other for your birthday, and possibly forever. 

Please continue to provide individuals across this earth with your insight, your love, your wisdom and support. Help those with pain to not feel pain, help those to be able to eat food; help those with anxiety to feel strong enough to take risks in life and be confident in themselves. There are those of us who have exhausted your greatness, and it is our responsibility to let you be a cherished memory close to our hearts while we enjoy this time we have in this life with our selves, and most importantly, our loved ones. 


To all of you who are starting your journey I wish you good luck, and please remember you are not alone. At first, it will suck. Eating will be hard, sleeping will be hard, being happy will ironically be hard. But you’re a fighter and once you break through the mud.... boy is the grass fucking green and soft. 

Much love my friends.",154,0

Like the title says I'm 25 and have smoked every day since the second half of university. I come from a family of smokers; my father has been a daily smoker my entire life and my siblings are the same way.

Because of weed, my degree took 7 years instead of 4 and I came incredibly close to not graduating. I lost a relationship and lost touch with my incredible friend group from high school. I spent most of my time playing video games, pursuing a dream of a career in e-sports which would never be achievable when high 24/7.

My increasing smoking habit led to a really tough depressive episode near the end of my degree. I spent all my time high in bed trying to block out the world. When I wasn't high, I had suicidal thoughts. This culminated in my getting arrested for trying to run from a cop who tried to pull me over when I was out for a panicked, anxious drive to try and clear my mind. I wasn't high, I don't know what went through my head, it just happened.

I was very fortunate with the legal system and after 4 years am finally turning that page for good and walking away with no permanent record.

I turned to the gym to get through my depression and had two positive years of self-improvement, but  have always been weighed down by my smoking habit. Last year, I injured by back and have been out of the gym suffering from chronic pain since. I've been getting professional help, but that is over for now with the pandemic, and I no longer have the gym to keep me sane.

So now my smoking habit is also a source of pain management, which is making it even more difficult for me to consider quitting.

I smoke 2 grams of shatter a week + a few grams of flower. I'm as high as I can get any time I'm not at work (and sometimes then). I have dreams which have been on standstill for the last 6 years of my life because of smoking. I've barely managed to get to where I am and I don't even know if I can maintain this 9-5 grind my whole life if all I'm doing is smoking.

The last time I stopped smoking would have been a day-long tolerance break maybe 5 years ago. When I stop, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I sweat a disgusting amount in the few fitful hours I do get. I'm honestly scared to try and go even a night without smoking, but I haven't even gotten close to that point.

I'm just so fucking done. I need help, and so far my posting this is the biggest step in helping myself I've taken in years.

Please read.","I am two weeks sober. I’m relatively young dude (19 years old) compared to many on here. I was dependent on weed for two years. I tried to quit the herb many times, but I truly believe this time is different.

Let me tell you my story.

My post history on reddit is a firsthand example of the mental toll this drug has taken on me over the last two years. I went from a motivated, high achieving student religiously posting on college subreddits to a complete stoner (and anxious wreck) warning those on /r/oilpen about fake carts. Like many of you, I told myself the lie I was capable of being a “high-functioning” stoner. In reality, I became a “barely-functioning” addict.

Coming out of high school, I was accepted to a top twenty university on a full scholarship. I decided to take it easy senior year, which is when I let myself go & became a complete weed fiend. I absolutely loved weed at first, somehow way more than most. I told myself I would quit when I went to to college.

I distinctly remember meeting my roommate (now one of my best friends) freshman year of college. Let’s call him P. When I first met him, I remember trying to feel P out & contemplating whether or not I should tell him about my habit. Both of us quite shy, I decided to ask him if he had smoked weed in high school. He responded with a resounding “Yes!” and that he had been fiending since senior year as well. Ten minutes later, we both whipped out our dab pens & the rest was history. We smoked every single day to the point where it became a ritual. We figured that we were young & that we should live it up our freshman year. I was soon FULLY dependent marijuana (specifically wax) and was getting high all day everyday. This went on for nearly 2 years.

Fast forward to first semester sophomore year (last semester), P and I were still toking it up like crazy with only vague intentions to stop. All of the sudden, at the beginning of last semester, P became quiet, sleepy, and more unmotivated than usual. Something was off, and I assumed it was depression at first. I made the huge mistake of continuing to enable P by smoking in our dorm room and he never truly ended up quitting despite his intentions.

This last semester, not a whole lot changed regarding our pot use. We kept smoking and smoking, but this time we managed to taper down & stick to just flower. P, however, was still acting off when he wasn’t high and I decided to finally confront him about it. He revealed to me that had been hearing voices for the past year. These voices were preventing from concentrating in school & confining him to his bed all day. Upon hearing this, I broke down. It all made sense. When we were high, so many times had P told me superstitious shit & how he was “communicating with God”. I would just tell him that he was high as fuck and just trippin’ & we’d just laugh it off. Little did I know that P was literally HEARING a discourse between God and the Devil in his mind. When he broke the news that he was hearing voices & these voices were perpetually throwing him into a debilitated state, I realized he likely had schizophrenia. Upon this realization, I tearfully asked P, “What if you hadn’t smoked weed to begin with? You think things would be different?” He revealed to me that ever since he smoked marijuana in high school, something was “off” in his mind and he couldn’t quite point his finger on it. As he continued to smoke like crazy alongside me, his condition worsened to what it is today.

I’m not suggesting that marijuana is the culprit for psychosis & schizophrenia. I do know though that it can bring out these conditions in those that are at risk of developing them (like P was, even though he had no idea). I was affected by the plant differently. Persistent, hourly exposure to very high THC levels led to severe anxiety to the point where it was debilitating, triggering multiple mental breakdowns throughout freshman year. I somehow continued to smoke to quell this anxiety, which became a vicious cycle and exacerbated it in the long run. No matter how much I wanted to smoke in moderation, I just couldn’t do it because I was fully addicted.

P and I are still very close friends & have gone back home because of this corona shit. P, who stills hears voices everyday, has been sober for over a month. I’ve been sober for two weeks. We are supporting each other in this journey and I aspire to one day attend medical school & specialize in psychiatry so I can help P and those suffering from similar conditions. As an addict myself, I have taken an interest in studying addictions and also intend to go into addiction psychiatry.

These past two weeks, I have gotten intense cravings & thought of kickin’ it and smoking a joint is so enticing. However, I have taken comfort in knowing that my anxiety has vanished. The mental clarity is phenomenal. I have aced all of my exams this past week, something I’ve never done during my time in college. I feel so much more confident in my abilities. I also have an extremely supportive girlfriend (who I love deeply) that tells me everyday I made the correct decision.

Whenever I get the urge to smoke, I just think about all the negative shit this plant has caused all of us. It has blunted us, made us perpetually  lazy, and has sapped us of our intrinsic human motivation to better ourselves. It ultimately destroyed my best friend.

I’m never going back and this post can hold me accountable.

\[Edit\] Let me make something clear guys. I am not staying weed was the CAUSE of P's schizophrenia. According to the scientific literature, the cause is likely attributed to an underlying genetic abnormality and/or environmental factors such as exposure to teratogens. All I'm saying is that marijuana certainly exacerbated his condition and served as a pivotal trigger. Upon smoking for the first time, P reported he had never felt the same and that something was off, even if hadn't developed the condition right off the bat. It may have been entirely possible he would have developed the condition anyway if he hadn't smoked weed but my gut tells me otherwise.

\[Edit\] Thanks for the silver & gold. Here's to a life of purpose, confidence, and NEVER giving in!",416,1

I hope some of you can relate.,"Weed was my best friend. It still wants to be my best friend. Not a day has gone by since I stopped using where I have not known the precise location of my stash, my vape. I want to throw it all into a pond. But I’m not there yet. It’s still my friend. Even if I hate it. Even if I know it makes me weak. It makes me complacent which makes me weak. There is no need to try if I am complacent. There is no growth if I don’t care to try. And there is something about life without growth that makes it pointless. Makes it fake. Merely existing, awaiting death. Not a life for me. And yet I can’t stop thinking about my friend Weed.

One problem is that I can’t bring myself to hate Weed. Weed is innocent, in a way. It just sits there. When I turn my back on it, I lose my appetite for a day and my sleep suffers for a few nights. Then it is apparently over with. What a kind, gentle drug! Except it’s not that simple. The stoner still persists deep within me, and the idea of blazing, of experiencing that warm foggy embrace, I can’t shake it out of my head. I want to forget about Weed, which is ironic because I used Weed to forget about everything else. 

I have been friends with Weed for such a long time that life without it feels like life without a piece of myself. I keep waiting for the void it left behind to fill, but I often doubt it will ever fill. I stuff healthy activities into that void, which helps, but it often feels like I am throwing handfuls of dirt into a crater that is miles wide. The hard truth, the truth that I am only now seeing, is that the void I am speaking of was there before I ever picked up a joint or a bong or a vape. The void exists not because of Weed, but because of my own shortcomings, and my awareness of those shortcomings. Without Weed I see the true scope of the void, and I see just how difficult it can be to address with healthy strategies.

Sometimes I gaze into the void to see how far down it goes. I guess some people call that self-reflection. Down there at the bottom, it’s hard to see. But the more time I spend examining the bedrock of my mind, the more I learn about why I have spent so much of my time dissatisfied, hiding myself in a comfortable ignorance. I don’t really like the things I see down there at the bottom. But those things are real. And realness is what you don’t get when you live life as a stoner. I can still hear my friend Weed calling to me, telling me it would be easier to back away from the void, to sit down on some soft grass and pretend nothing is wrong. After all, that mentality has gotten me through many years. Why not a few more?

Here’s why. I am done living life the easy way. Because as I tried to say before, a life lived easily is a life unlived. I want to learn to love the discomfort. I want to learn to love throwing my handfuls of healthy Weed alternatives into that void until the void is gone. Or to at least die knowing I did my best to fill it up the hard way. Maybe at some point I can even learn to love that big gaping pit I call my faults, my regrets, my depression, my rage, my fears. I want a life of realness, not a life of complacency. Life is not designed to be fun and cozy all of the time, it is meant to be real all of the time. I want to be real for all of the time that I have left.",34,0

And that sucks.,"Marijuana has done more damage to me than all other drugs combined. It lulled me into this horrible false sense of security when everything was dangerously wrong, eventually. My writing ability is a quarter of what it was when I toked on weekends. When I smoked twice per week I was writing constantly, and now I find it hard to even think of ideas when smoking or not smoking. But when I'm smoking even if I don't come up with an idea, I feel too good to care about my wasted creativity, and that is beyond horrible. If only I had just stuck to being a weekend warrior, or better yet never tried the drug at all.

&#x200B;

After that first year however, I deliberately become a pothead, I couldn't imagine going a day, nay an hour without THC in my soul. Moderation became an impossible fantasy at that very moment. Fuck moderation, I couldn't imagine a second without being high, tolerance and potential debilitating withdrawal symptoms from this ""decision"" become damned. When I first went to rehab, I didn't give one fucking shit about anything for literally four horrible long dark years (that I did a ton of hard drugs during but remained Marijuana free against my will for) but the battle cry, ""GOD I CANNOT WAIT TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE AND GET FADED AGAIN OFF THC AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO I CAN QUIT THE OTHER DRUGS AND FEEL COMPLETE AND WHOLE AGAIN!!!""

&#x200B;

What you don't have you'll never miss. She is my ultimate absolute weakness and I pray that I can stay away forever because Marijuana has twisted me up from the very inside out into someone I loathe and cannot recognize anymore. Words cannot rationally fathom ly how much I will always both TRULY LOVE and UTTERLY HATE Marijuana for the rest of my life. The only thing I will defend about Marijuana to the death of me is the gateway theory. Other drugs have only EVER made me crave Pot 1,000,000 times more, not want to abandon it. It was my exit drug, never the gateway. But Cannabis ended up damaging me far more than all the other drugs combined because it was the only one I underestimated what it was doing to my life, habits and personality to the very end the damage it was doing, because I needed it more than a crackhead needs crack. Cannabis isn't evil, but it has to remain used responsibly as do all mind-altering substances. They are not toys, they are powerful chemical allies, tools & landmines that can easily show you the gates of both Nirvana serenity in heaven and the very bottom of hellfire in the blink of an eye. Because I could never use substances responsibly or temperately as others, therefore I have no right to drink or use again. God willing I never forget where my addiction did in fact take me. I just love drugs too much not to be an addict and eventually self destruct.

&#x200B;

What I fear most is that I'll have years clean and sober and then start reminding myself of how ""good"" that high is. Weed is the only drug that will take everything from me, but I will just keep coming back for more like a brain-damaged prostitute. It is the only drug that will make me lie through my teeth just to maintain the high, destroy my personality and character, lie both to myself and my loved ones just for another glimpse at a world I've already visited too many damn times to get anything out of it anymore. Weed is the only drug where I will sideline all my responsibilities just to keep the stoned escape fuck life universe going a little while longer because I always know what comes next and dread the comedown more and more as my tolerance increases. A tidal wave of grief and self-loathing, knowing that I'm wasting away my life into a shell of a human, and subverting and destroying all of my potential all for a silly, stupid fucking overrated plant. It was never worth it after the first year of blissful smoking, because I forgot to consume responsibly and only cared afterwards about staying stoned at all costs.

&#x200B;

I wish my brain was ignorant of this delicious haze cloud of blissful but stupidity drenched ignorance. It is medicinal, yet poison all at the same time. So subtle in its negatives it steals years of your life and money and soul away without you ever noticing. The other drugs are nice enough to broadside pummel you against the floor with a curling iron when you overstep your boundaries, while Cannabis slowly threads you up in a web like Spiderman until you suffocate with or without it. Consume responsibily in all actions, or watch the action consume you...and then there is no going back and you will regret it for an eternity. LESS IS ALWAYS MORE!!! And if you cannot adhere to this principle, STAY THE FUCK OFF THE TRAIN FOR DEAR LIFE!!! Ignorance truly is happiness. Only now do I understand this philosophy that I once mocked as an ""intellectual"", I now long for and salviate for like Palov's slobbering dog.",1,0

Stumbled across this subreddit a few days ago and after reading posts I decided to quit. I've tried quitting once in the past (about six months) and ended up falling back into it, so this is my second try and I've decided it's for good. I didn't really have a reason last time except that the person who got me into weed said they were going to quit, so I thought I'd try. She relapsed and then I stopped caring. But this time it's for me.

I didn't get into weed until later in life, maybe three years ago, and I'm 26 now. I had a bunch of friends who smoked and made edibles, and honestly as soon as I tried I was really into it. I'm sure you all know the story of it escalating until you're an almost daily user. I only smoked once or twice because my mom had lung cancer, but I did edibles every or every other day. It was my ritual. Get home after a long day, pop an edible. I live alone and as a lesbian I feel isolated in the city I'm in. My beautiful girlfriend lives four hours away. It made the evenings tolerable, I had fun eating and watching movies alone. And then it started occurring to me that I was just using to stave away that feeling of emptiness. If I was sad, anxious, or bored, time for weed. The highs were never like my first time using, but sometimes they were good. Usually they were over quickly, just leaving me with a headache. But the next day I'd try all over again!

I wish I had a healthy relationship with weed, I really do. I'd love to be able to do it with friends or not feel the craving to do it every day. But this subreddit has made me realize it's not possible for me. I don't feel the same way about weed as I do about alcohol — I can have alcohol in my home and not feel like it's a siren call.

I think I initially stopped a few days ago to prove to myself that I could. I got hit with an awful dizzying headache today, and nervously looked up symptoms of weed withdrawal. Headaches. Of course. It's time to admit to myself that I'm more addicted than I'm wanting to realize. As I'm typing this I've set up giving away all of my edibles to someone who uses tomorrow. It feels like ripping off a band-aid. After this I'll have no weed, no edibles, and I have no dealer so I won't be able to get more. God it was so hard to give away all of my edibles but I need them gone. I'm a super positive person so I'm trying to be determined and upbeat right now but I'm just crying. I feel like I've let myself and my loved ones down by having this happen. I'm scared of what's going on with my brain and I'm scared to tell anyone.

Any comments would be really appreciated. I've never had withdrawal symptoms before. I'm trying to tell myself it's okay but it's probably the anxiety from withdrawal too that's making me feel like such a failure for having this happen in the first place. I feel really alone.",10,0

I had a BIG weed problem from 17-23. Smoking every single day, only breaks when I had to - either around family or when my dealers were out. I realized I was ill but couldn’t help but lighting up. Weed calmed me sometimes and other times it made me forget my problems.

Case in point;
So little did I know I have had bipolar disorder all this time. Symptoms started when I was in my early teens for real. I knew I was prone to arguments, swinged between energetic and depressed to the point of suicidal ideations. Alcohol made me buzzed, anxious and feel relief - all at the same time. But I HAD to have weed. Drinking without winding down on weed was unthinkable for me. I knew I had a problem when I started experimenting with MDMA and would do 400-500 mg in one roll. DANGEROUS! 

So weed “helped” but made my hypomanic phases unproductive - and my depressions worse. When it started affecting my productivity in school I knew I had a problem. So I quit weed thinking it would solve everything. It didn’t. I kept on relapsing aswell. 

I had NO serious idea of what bipolar disorder is. I knew I was a bit more emotional and sensitive than almost all my friends though - and gravitated more towards addictive behavior than most of them. I even heard about an acquaintance having bipolar disorder and brushed it off like “surely she’s just a bitch, self centered and can’t cope with life” “Everybody has their ups and downs”

BOY WAS I WRONG. No wonder I thought it was normal. We were in the same boat!

Now I’m on meds and absolutely capable of controlling my substance abuse. Weed isn’t good for my mental health, but some here and there is no biggie. Point is I don’t need it as a crutch to survive. Bipolar is dangerous (25% attempt suicide) and should not be taken lightly. There are good meds to cope. You ABSOLUTELY need them for the sake of your own good and not least for those around you. In my opinion. I lead a destructive lifestyle, and I had a feeling I wouldn’t make it to 30 from when I was around 18. That is fucked when I think about it now after gaining stability. 

I’m not saying I think everyone with a drug problem has bipolar disorder, far from it. But statistics show a lot of people go undiagnosed and self medicate. If you have a drug problem - go see a healthcare professional and let them help you evaluate the possibility. I was a long time lurker at r/leaves and hoped everything would sort itself out if I quit. When it didn’t I was devastated. I hope I can help someone with this post. Please don’t brush this off - think about it and read up. If you find it hard to quit - seek help. Even if you don’t have underlying mental illness. But be warned.

Thank you for your attention! Keep on fighting the good fight!! And feel free to ask me anything.",8,0

Today is day #8.,"The urge to stop hit me on a Saturday morning, around 8:30AM after a morning smoke with a cup of coffee in my hand. I realized I did not care about the sunrise anymore. Like, I was staring right through the trees at the beautiful sunrise, and I just turned around and walked away from it.

That was unacceptable to me for some reason. I lead a very busy life, and weed never halted my productivity thank god, but being numb to the fundamentals of life's beauty.... that struck a chord.

Today is day #8 since that sunrise, and it rained for the first time in a while this morning. I sat next to the window, opened it up, and enjoyed listening to the rain for about an hour this morning. That's the first time I've not been numb to nature in about 3 years of everyday smoking. I guess today is the first time I've realized that numbness is gone.

I'm glad I'm connecting with nature again. I want to keep this up. It's hard not to reach into the closet and grab the bong when I'm having a stress headache though. I've been drinking again in the meantime... so it's becoming an easier and easier excuse to pack another bowl. I know I just need to deal with the pain of stress to deal with the stress naturally, though. My body is just learning. I know that. I just gotta keep it up.

I'm sorry it's been so long since I've made a post like this, I've really been focusing on my school (for the first time in years). 

How are y'all? Just at the beginning of your journey or struggling a couple of weeks or months in? 

I really like to make these threads because so many days during my sobriety process, I felt so depressed that I wasn't feeling any better and so discouraged that being sober wasn't making me a better person. I would always look here in /r/leaves for encouragement when I inevitably hit another lull in the process. 

You can look at my profile history for the full story but the TLDR goes something like this : I smoked consistently for 4 years, steadily increasing my usage year to year. By 2018 it was an all day affair, 90% pen hits for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and then 2-3 gravity bong hits to go to sleep. I had no idea the damage I was causing to my overall health and mental health because I was always so numb and ""happy"". 

I faced major depression, anxiety, panic attacks 24/7 which led to depersonalization, lack of appetite, threw up every morning for the first 2 weeks. My resting heart rate was 85BPM and it constantly felt like my heart was beating out of my chest. I could barely hear sometimes because I had tinnitus so loud and 24/7 racing thoughts on top of that. Any awful, terrible symptom that you could possibly get, I had almost all of them.

That was 8 months ago. A few weeks ago I read something on this subreddit about not letting quarantine become an excuse to start/continue smoking, and something about that post stuck with me. I've been trying to quit again and doing the usual ""spring cleaning"" to go along with it. That's something which really helped before.

&#x200B;

I'm genuinely shocked by what I found when I dug into my closet just now. The clothing... a lot of it... is definitely too disgusting to wear. I'm am so deeply embarrassed by the thought of wearing these clothes in public. Why didn't I buy new clothes? I have spent at least $2000 on weed since I started smoking again. 

&#x200B;

Most of the Tshirts had whitened armpits, stiff and waxy to the touch from deodorant. I have 4 shirts left now. All but one of pair of shorts were either stained or had holes in them. The pair that didn't? Well, the fly likes to come down on its own. Potheads don't care about that. So... now I don't have any shorts. I live in Vietnam. Let that sink in for a moment. Fortunately I have pants for work. Three pairs: the dirty man-child's number. Just enough to trick yourself into thinking nobody else will notice.

&#x200B;

I wonder what all of the Vietnamese people who saw me dressed like that thought? I am so unbelievably privileged here. Yet I dress like a teenager whose mom has given up? Wow. The more I think about it, the more profound and shocking this realization is. I used to have a drinking problem too; that finally stopped when I was randomly taken aback by my ""garbage can."" A paper supermarket bag full of empty bottles and cans, wet with spilled beer, about to burst at the seams, and smelling like a dirty bar. I still remember it that moment. It was a huge turning point for me.

I used to take several-week breaks from weed periodically, for various reasons, for example to re-gain sensitivity to it, save money, focus on exams, etc. But I always used to look forward to the spliff on the other side of the break.

After reading a post on r/leaves, I was motivated to quit weed forever, without looking back. (Side note: it was a really long post with a parable about being in a forest, can someone help me find it again?) Anyway, life is overall a lot better for me than before. I have a clearer head, much better productivity, more spare money.... the list goes on\*.

**The Story**

It's Coronavirus quarantine time, I'm inescapably always home with my parents. I haven't smoked or even thought about smoking in a long time. (Not that it's an option. Even before I quit, I was always meticulously hiding it from them. Whereas before, I could go to other social spaces to smoke, my current setup leaves me with absolutely no room to sneak off for a spliff.)

On this particular day, I have a full blown anxiety attack. I'm pacing around the room, can't focus on what needs to be done, crying, stressing, sitting down, getting back up, flapping, going crazy. I feel trapped in my body, and my body is in a crazy state of emergency-style panic.

**""I wish I could just smoke a spliff and get high!**""

This is the exact thought that suddenly pops into my brain out of nowhere. Weird, because I've been contentedly off weed for quite a while, 181 days to be exact. Also I typically didn't used to use smoking as a ""crutch"". Weed to me was always more of a happy / playtime activity back when I was a smoker.

So, mid anxiety attack, I sit  down and reach for my imaginary jar of weed. I take out a few imaginary buds with shaking hands, and put them into my imaginary grinder. (As a bit of a weakling with sensitive skin, I kind of relish imaginary grinding because it doesn't hurt my hands like real grinding does.) I mix in the invisible tobacco (yeah I'm British), take an imaginary paper, check where the imaginary sticky part is, put my imaginary mix into it, make an imaginary roach, and twist it all up into an imaginary spliff. (Again, relief at the fact that it can't possibly be a whack spliff - I was never too good at rolling). I search for the imaginary lighter, which is obviously, not where it should be (fucking typical), until I finally find it in my pocket. I smile at my lame in-joke.

By the time I take my first toke of the imaginary spliff, not only has my anxiety completely gone, I feel almost irl high. The tokes I'm fake-inhaling are obviously a good breathing exercise. But it still makes me marvel how, even though I know this is all a play-pretend game, tricking myself into taking deep breaths, I'm somehow still benefiting from the trick.

Anyway, the best part was, after I had pretend-smoked the entire spliff, I GOT UP. Unlike real weed, which would have just turned me into a sloth, I was able to actually move with energy and motivation, to do the thing I was trying to do.

\*I don't believe weed is intrinsically bad. I personally chose to put it aside, but I don't judge smokers, and I know plenty of people who are able to have healthy, productive lives while using cannabis on the side. The way that it affected me was only bad because no matter how hard I tried (and boyyy did I try), I  wasn't able to use it in moderation.",3,3

After reading so many posts where you guys are beating yourself up over this. I smoked for what seemed like eons. In all those years I would quit many, many times  and go back. Not once did I ever feel badly about it. 
Most say I have a weird sense of humor. I think it helped me deal with this demon.
May I suggest each time you quit write about it. Write letters to that demon- it's daily battles you need to deal with  not the whole freaking war.
Day by day.
Also I have some cool ass friends, stoners,lol ,but everytime I quit I told them and they did their best to help me, not smoking around me, not giving me a hit when I got weak...
Eventually I realized it's all up to me to slay this demon.. Put on that chainmail and get to it!
I'm not saying its easy. 
I'm not saying you wont have withdrawals 
I'm saying stop beating yourself up about it.
If I can do it trust me anyone can.

There were a couple of common themes. I was vaping in a parking lot on my way to a meeting, trying to do it so no one around would see.  

These two things fit my profile: 
1. using weed to deal with the unknown and the stress of that, highlighting my insecurity and lack of self worth, and 
2. hiding it from others which induces a feeling of shame and aloneness in me.

It's clear to me that the drug stunted my personal growth a long time ago and I began believing that I need it to get through stressful situations. It also reinforces in me that I am not good enough on my own to handle life's challenges and I need the thc as a crutch to get through them.

This is the big lie of the drug of course. I am good enough, just how I am.  I don't need thc to get through tough situations, in fact it makes things worse by reinforcing this idea that I am not good enough.

For me, my poison is booze. I'm an alcoholic, and alcohol has already taken away a lot from me. I've been lucky, and I'm also 32 days sober from that and I've been filling my days with many good things, such as AA/other recovery programs (online), therapy, reading, journaling, cooking and playing bass. I'm already really proud of this month but I know addiction is a life long journey and even though I've been battling with the booze for a good couple years now, it's still just the start.

Things aren't perfect. I still smoke a lot of weed. I quit cigarettes 29 days ago, but then I bought a shitty disposable vape about a week ago and been puffing on that fairly consistently. I'm also battling screen addiction in the form of reddit, youtube and video games. On the one hand, at this point choosing *anything* over alcohol is a good choice. But it's not the best choice. There was a day recently, thinking about how much I've allowed booze to destroy my life. I went out to for a walk and a joint, and I almost cried, feeling so grateful for being able to just smoke weed instead. But I know of course it's not the best solution.

I've been trying to get back into my buddhist practice and trying to meditate daily (twice a day is the goal) and damn it's hard to focus on your breath and the present moment when you're actually still on drugs.

I work in the cannabis industry, grow the shit, and love my job. However, it's dawned on me since day 1 how my peers influence what is socially acceptable. We smoke on every break, talk about weed all day, etc. That said, I've been off work for many months now on medical leave. I'm focusing on my mental health, and it comes down to habits and how I choose to make up my days.

I've been going to online meetings for several weeks now which is great for keeping my mind on recovery. However, it's so much easier to blame booze for everything, and not my self and my actions. My smoking weed led me to sit in my comfy womb of addiction. Original drug of choice is video games, gaming since 4yrs old, and I'm realizing how much that messed me up too. Instead of focusing on the drug, I need to focus on the mental processes that happen before and after, because ultimately that's what I am capable of controlling.

This is my first time posting on Reddit. I came across this community last night and decided to create an account.

I have been smoking pot regularly since I was 15, I guess this would make it about 7 years now. I have had periods where I wouldn't smoke very often and periods where I needed to smoke just so I could function.

Marijuana has never really done much for me as far as benefits go, I almost always end up paranoid and harshly self-critical. I honestly have no idea why I smoke it so much, I think I just like to be intoxicated.

I have noticed that the day after I smoke, I feel awful. I am unmotivated and stuck in my own head. My communication skills and self confidence suffer greatly. When I smoke for a few consecutive days and stop, I almost always become depressed and suicidal. Yet I still continue to get stoned.

Almost 2 years ago now, when I was smoking very heavily. I set myself a challenge to not get high for the month of August 2018. After the first few days, I didnt even miss it and felt SO MUCH MORE ALIVE. I remember sitting at my mate's place sometime in September with a bong in my hand looking at the weed and thinking, ""I feel amazing having not smoked for a month, is it really worth it?"". I decided to get high anyway, and I havent gone any longer than 2 weeks without weed ever since.

I have decided that I am going to go at least another month pot-free, as my mental health is seriously deteriorating. I would love to go even longer without getting stoned, but I must set myself a realistic goal that I can work towards.

Reading these posts has been incredibly inspiring and has given me a sense of hope and belonging, I will be sure to post again throughout my THC-free endeavor and keep you folks up to date.

Thank you for giving me a place to express my thoughts and hold myself accountable.",9,0

When the room is filled with anxiety, you can shut yourself in the closet, but eventually you have to get out, and the anxiety is still there.

Anyway, I cracked a couple of nights ago. I hadn't counted how many days sober I was, maybe 4 or 5. Until the other night I was sat at my desk trying to scrape every molecule of THC from my grinder that I could get. It felt... degrading.

This is Day 0.,"I remember the first time I smoked. I was 13 and on holiday in New York with my girlfriend at the time. her cousin was a really cool guy who was turning 17 I think the day we arrived. They had an apartment in Manhattan and I thought the whole vibe was the coolest thing. He had one of those digital volcanos and after we had gone to dinner with his family he packed out a bowl into it and passed it over to me. This was the first time I remember being 'high'.

When I got back to London I started figuring out where I could get my hands on the stuff and which one of my friends wanted to come on the journey with me. There were a few willing participants who would end up becoming my best friends at the time, some of which are still here today, others lost. We would befriend dealers and off we would go to the local parks to 'blaze up' and roll around the grass in the sun laughing our asses off. I guess the fun kind of changed when we would be huddled up in alley ways during the winter trying to smoke in the rain.

It probably became a truly daily vice when I was around 15. I would try my hardest every day to scrape £10 together to get a 'tens' or a 'bens' as we used to call in back in the day. By that time I had a good 5 or 6 dealers I could get it from so sourcing it was never a problem. Shamefully I remember days I would even steal from my mums purse or lift money off the counter if I came across it in order to make sure I could smoke that day.

I couldn't really smoke around my parents, they would smell it most times and freak out. My parents are pretty dysfunctional at the best of times as it is. One example of how they would act about 'drugs' etc would be when I was about 14... My mum and dad found what looked like an old warhammer paint pot in the oven. I genuinely have no idea how it got there and did not put it there. At around midnight my parents burst into my room screaming at my while I was trying to sleep. I remember my dad screaming things like 'I cant believe you are on drugs, my boy on drugs!'. I got out of bed put on my clothes and ran out the house, terrified. I hadn't even done anything! That's just a snapshot of how they act. They also argued A LOT when I was little (8, 9, 10 years old etc) to the point where it was physical. The first person I ever punched in the face was my dad after he put his hands on my mum.

Anyway.. I couldn't smoke at home so needed to find somewhere to facilitate my dirty secret daily smoking. This is when I met someone who I will call 'J'. J was a lot older than me. When I was 15 I think he must have been about 22. He lived on his own in a council flat about 10 minutes walk from my house. It had been given to him through the welfare system as he was claiming 'depression' and an inability to work. Don't get me wrong, I am sure  J was depressed, you could see it in his sunken eyes. J liked to smoke and so did I and he would let me come over every day to smoke at his after school. I would generally supply the weed. It was definitely a situation where we both used each other, him for the supply and me for the location. This went out for roughly 3 years until I went to University.

I still smoked daily all throughout my time at uni. I ended up with a 2:1 in English Literature from a decent uni and met a lot of great people there. I also had a lot of friends from back home who went to the same place so we had a real strong crew there. This is also where I met a girl who I will call 'G'. She lived in the same house as my oldest friend who also went to the same Uni and I soon fell in love with her. She was with someone at the time so I didn't really have a chance to make a move on her. Besides, I was a bit of a 'ladies man' at uni and was sleeping around so in my eyes I didn't really have the 'time' for a real relationship. Eventually though, one night, I came back to theirs late one night after a bender and ended up crashing in her bed (top and tail). In the morning I woke and she was still there lying next to me, we started getting off and the rest is history... She left her BF at the time and boom she was mine.

G also smoked in the past but had kind of kicked the habit until she met me. We began smoking daily together. We also started picking up big bits of weed and selling it to people we knew in order to keep the daily habit alive and fund it all. We never had any problems with this and it all went pretty smoothly, other than the days we couldn't get any, which would stress me the fuck out. People say that weed doesn't have a cold turkey dependancy type grip but to be honest that is BS and these days would prove it to me. I would become agitated, angry and pretty much desperate to sort something. This should have been a sign.

By this time Uni was ending, I was roughly 22 and had been smoking pretty much daily for 9 years. Crazy how time flies. Me and G had been on and off throughout this time, myself breaking it off the first time and then her (this would happen throughout our 8 years together, the longest gap being almost a year apart). We moved back to London and basically I fell into a hole.

I moved back in with my parents and basically put myself on a second 'gap year' which lasted around 18 months. I was stuck, depressed and getting high every day. I had no motivation. I did not know what to do in life. I did not know where to start. Uni was fine because you had a loose structure and a goal to work towards. When I was thrust into the real world I felt lost. My parents would try to motivate me but I couldnt do it. G would also try to motivate me but in all honesty I was a massive loser and even though I didnt deserve her, G stayed with me. Although she was also smoking regularly, she had her shit together, had a job and was happy. I knew she wanted the same for me but I am very stubborn guy and have always been adverse to letting people help me. I have also always been adverse to opening up to people and letting know I need help.

Eventually, G suggested a line of work for me to go into, which I did and I ended up being pretty good at it. I have now been in the working world for about 4 years, to the point where I run my own business with a good friend and make decent money. Coronavirus has been pretty tough on us but I think we will survive. All this time I have been smoking daily. I smoked last night before bed. For the past couple of years I have stopped smoking skunk and only smoke hash. It still fucks you up.

G recently left me and I will explain why. I have been having anger outbursts which almost get violent. Me and her argue over stupid stuff and sometimes I will just explode at her. Sometimes even in public places around strangers we will have a screaming match. It is horrible and I cant explain it. She does not deserve it whatsoever and it breaks my heart that it happened like it did. We should have been moving in together by this point and really building towards a future but something has been stopping me (probably the smoking). She is the love of my life and I would do anything to be with her. Problem is, I already had my chances and one of the things she told me I had to do was stop smoking. I couldnt do it. But now I feel like I need to, if not for her then for myself.

Watching videos on YT and reading articles and accounts here on this sub has opened my eyes to what G has been trying to tell me all along. Weed/hash has been clouding my mind, making me have these outbursts and stopping me from talking to people in order to express how I feel and stop these things building up to the point where they explode. I wish I worked this out sooner. I am also going to start therapy next week.

I am genuinely terrified about what is going to happen to me. I haven't been 'myself' I don't think for 15 years. What a crazy thought. I am going to stop smoking today and see how it goes. I guess this is day 0. I do not know what to expect, or what person I find out I am, but for the first time ever I actually feel kind of excited about it. I am hoping it gives me a new lease of life, a restored energy and also helps me open up to people like G who I love dearly and have neglected all of these years. I hope I haven't done too much damage to my poor brain already!

Sorry this is such a long post guys, its been a long old journey with weed and I had a lot to say. Interested to hear people's experiences and if they have been similar to mine.

Wish me luck folks, I'm going to need it!

Weekends I would be high all day, spending most of my time smoking or sleeping. I had also developed a habit of fapping when high. 
I have used regularly (daily) since 19, with some months in between where I would go cold turkey on it. So I have beaten weed for months at a stretch but mostly because I was staying with my parents and didn’t have a dealer nearby.  

Due to this quarantine situation I am back to staying with my parents - so have been sober for past 3 weeks.I don’t feel the urge to smoke weed anymore although week 2 was bad with some withdrawal.
My question is how do I keep weed at bay when I go back? Is once a week on Friday nights that bad? Do I try and quit it for good or there is some frequency at which I can keep smoking? How to decide??

I’ve always thought about it, lurked on this sub, took little breaks. Other than that I’ve been an all day every day smoker for about 3 years now. I’m one of those people that can function just fine high, working and attending class high and still getting above average grades and doing great at work. But after reading and lurking in this sub for a year or two now, I’ve begun to realize the negative side effects of this drug. Your days blur together and you just kind of become comfortable with being numb. I hate being congested all the time, I hate the smell of my room, I hate the amount of money I spend on weed. I hate coughing after every hit, I hate depending on weed to eat enough or to sleep enough. It’s not even a drug I smoke for fun anymore, it’s more of a habit that I can’t drop. It’s just everywhere around me! My siblings and cousins smoke, even my aunt and mom secretly smoke! My boyfriend and I smoke together as well... and we all live in the same house. I’m afraid it’s simply a social thing and a comfort I can’t be rid of. 

I’ve been thinking all of this for so long, but I’ve never been able to put it into words. I’ve pondered quitting but I’ve never actually decided like this.

I’ve tried to quit pot many times. The longest success was a year and a half. And it got back at me only stronger. I’ve always avoided admitting that I’m an addict. This word carries so much stigma with it. It’s an ugly word. I didn’t want to accept this reality. Thus, a fantasy, woven by the addiction, never left me: “One day I will be able to control it.” What a huge load of fucking bullshit.

When I’m in my smoking mode, cravings are so hard. When I stop smoking, cravings go away quite fast and I become complacent. Something in my mind doesn’t want me to remember how I felt when I was in the smoking mode. Something in my mind wants to hide it from me. It obscures the fact that I’m the addict. And with time, with success (of not smoking) I forget how bad it was and how fast I was back on track after just one small puff. And I take that fucking puff. And I must start all that motherfucking journey once again.

I want to share a small bit of prose with you guys. Maybe it will inspire someone.

I will face that monster once more and I will bury it. Fuck that motherfucker, I won’t let it control my life anymore. I will get that bitch with a baker’s knife. Just to make it more painful. I will put it down and I will kick it for many days. I will stomp on its senseless body until it’s deep in the ground. And then I’ll put a big gravestone on top of it. With the words cut in stone: “Here lies my addiction. Never let it crawl out.” And I’ll bring flowers to that grave until the end of my life. Some days I will cry tears of joy, some days I will tremble with fear. But I will always bring my knife with me. Just in case.

Stay strong guys.

(I’m 22 now) It’s been a very hard ride and it really didn’t become a huge problem until I was 19/20. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in 1st grade or so. With this, I’ve used marijuana as a coping mechanism but at first, it was for actual help for my anxiety. I was smoking two bowls a night to smoking about an eighth a night and smoking a lot of wax. Near the end, the last three years of smoking, I could not function without it. I could not sleep or eat. Near the end of my last year of smoking, I could not function whatsoever. I would have panic attacks over and over and use marijuana to help it. I would then wake up with a panic attack and repeat the same thing being stoned all day. One day, I couldn’t find anybody to pick up from for a day or two and I had things to do with my family anyways so I surprisingly stopped thinking about it. The next day, I picked up a Q and I didn’t touch it for days. I smoked once and broke down the next day. I mentally knew that I couldn’t do this anymore. I could not repeat the same bullshit every single day. I stopped cold turkey and ever since, my life has gotten better and better. I ended up getting 2 jobs, finding my passion in life and going to school. I have never been happier in my entire life. I finally had hope and figured out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Quitting has been the best decision of my life. If anybody is struggling or feeling hopeless, it is possible to quit. It’s a very hard process but after 2-3 weeks I began functioning again and starting the route to pure, genuine happiness. You’ve got this! I’m very excited to hit one year of being sober. :’)

Long time lurker but I've never had the confidence to post because of the social anxiety weed has caused for me. Being able to share my story today is a huge achievement for me even though im only 4 days sober. I've been smoking daily for about 3 years now and pretty much trying to quit for the past 2. It's a difficult task considering I live in a household full of daily smokers and the quarantine isn't helping since dispensaries count as essential businesses. I'm getting ready to take entrance exams for medical school and my memory is completely jacked from smoking so much these last few years so I have decided to just bite the bullet and go cold turkey. The first 2 days the cravings were horrible. But being able to say no when everyone in the room is smoking in spite of the cravings gives me confidence that this time I'm serious about quitting. My mind is still foggy but not smoking has opened up so much time in my day to better myself and prepare for exams. Surprisingly I haven't had much trouble sleeping or eating. The things that have helped me the most so far have been meditating, writing down my thoughts, switching coffee with tea, LOTS of veggies, pickle juice (gross for some but it does help!), and having a beer or two at night.

Habitual smoker for the past 10+ years here. Moved to LA about 8 months ago (from the Midwest). Was able to slow it down for about a month or so, but with the amazing quality and easy accessibility of the plant here, it made it nearly impossible for me to turn away from it. 
Being in quarantine for the past month has obviously been a triggering time for everyone, I feel like we all have subconsciously manifested this alone time to heal parts of ourselves as we step into the new decade. 
I am really going for it this time. And I was looking for a sign from the universe that im heading in the right direction, and When I checked my email tonight, a thread from this subreddit came up. and I’m so happy it did cause I have a headache from hell today and was thinking of lighting up.. but I was able to change my habit from right when I wake up and through out the day, to only smoking right before bed, and now I haven’t at all for the past 5 days. I am so proud of everyone taking this step to get to know their sober self better. 
I know this is just the beginning but i look at life so differently now and I just don’t think there’s any time to lose. I wish I could be the kind of person to do it every now and then, but I know quitting altogether will be for the best. No temptations. I’m excited to feel more productive, less groggy and moody, remember my dreams, and hopefully feel more confident in myself and direction. 
Anyways, just wanted to spread some love and say you are doing amazinggggg and this will be worth it! So happy to have found this group of like minded people : )

As proven by the existence of this sub, weed is not a panacea, but it feels that way when you are so deeply enthralled by it. The easy, confrontationaless world I lived in was bliss, and I never needed to face any difficult reality while I was there.

Multiple failures from almost 2 years of trying to quit, and failing to stick to my new year's resolution earlier this year, not enjoying the habit anymore, hating the dependence and fiendish behaviour for weed got me here. I've flushed probably half an ounce over the period of my regrets. Deleted multiple dealers numbers, and all this really strengthened me to be where I am today.

Now, for my purpose of this post. I'm back to my work-locked self I was as a kid. For two days now I've truly had no Zero Days. I've gotten up and gotten to work on learning skills and just plain hard work till the point I'm tired, and still I force myself to work while tired. It's basically till I can't stop sleep from taking over. I love this. It's shown me how lazy I've become over the years, and that I need to improve my mental stamina. Usually, I'd take breaks to smoke in-between work, and I'll get comfortable and lose hours because I'm no longer in the zone (work wise). The high would also let me fantasize and over plan ""my future"". But now, I just work towards it. I don't lie down for minutes thinking about what I need to do, waiting for ""motivation"" to make me stand up and work. I just get up and work. I don't have to plan when next I'll smoke or time my highs and come downs, so as to be a productive stoner. I'm just living as one person. I love this. I most especially love that all this is from 3 weeks. I'm looking forward to my 1 month progress, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year. Etc. I'm loving my future to come now. I don't have doubts about it. Stopping is definitely worth it.

I've been clean since july 2019. I decided to give up on weed because I wanted to have a child with my wife, and my addiction was too uncontrollable back then.

I've been OK all this time, but recently, with the quarantine and COVID19 situation, I had desires of using weed again. Have to say also that I'm anxious too, because wife is 9 month pregnant, and we are going to have our first baby in the middle of a world pandemic.

Today I went to my old flat to grab clothes, and other things.

I opened a drawer and I encountered little hemp dust. Have to say that it were very old remains that were fallen when I rolled my joints. 6 year old tobacco and little resin dust.

I ended up relapsing, I rolled one tobacco joint with that.

I barely couldn't feel the high, just flavour. My mood have improved temporally, and I felt super well for a few hours. Remembered the good feelings of being high.

Few hours later, my mood changed again. I got angry, because I didn't have more dust or weed.

Now, I'm feeling guilty for have been an idiot and relapsed. The cravings for weed have returned.

Any advice?

Just need to get it off my chest and bounce ideas off people)","I’ll just get right to it. Been smoking weed regularly this year but no issues regarding proper addiction, the likes of which I’m feeling now. 
          I’ve got a history of depression and normally weed never used to help that besides as a distraction and then my girlfriend broke up with me. I spent a week blazing basically constantly (obviously not healthy mentally or physically) and then I had a kind of mentality change where when I was high I’d be analysing what makes me depressed and why the relationship didn’t work. Essentially it helped me get deeper into issues that I felt couldn’t be achieved sober. 

Anyway, I ran out of weed that time and got my shit together because I realised that waking up late, eating trash and not doing anything all day made me depressed, all of which was basically directly caused by weed so I stopped it. 

Then I had a fortnight or so of being productive. Running, working out, meditating, yoga, cooking good foods and I wasn’t feeling depressed at all. The only time I’d get depressed was when I was studying (because I hate my subject and the work but that’s another conversation) but I thought I’d treat myself with a joint since I’d been good and how bad could it be. 

That was on Sunday and I’ve spent the each day since then baking up and watching classic films which surprisingly I enjoyed. I wasn’t depressed (that only came about last night and tonight) but I think I had a realisation about why I went back to weed and that’s because the productive time I had was so. Fucking. Boring. Same shit, different day (I’m isolating alone so no one to talk to face to face). I like how my mind works when I’m high and it felt better than the boredom of before.

The issue is I’m not productive at all when smoking and when I’m sober, I miss being high. I’ve tried self control but if there’s weed in my room, I can’t be productive until it’s all gone. 

And today, I’m feeling depressed and want to smoke up badly and am having that internal debate of whether to call my dealer or not. 

I want to quit because I’m a runner so my lungs are obviously not getting stronger. I want to quit so I can find things I enjoy doing whilst sober (that’s an issue in isolation because I can’t really start a new hobby). I need to quit so I can pass my exams in a couple months

Just ordered an electric longboard, paid for by the weed I no longer smoke.","This gave me some serious perspective. I want/need some new hobbies, and love snowboarding/surfing, but can't do that in my country. Combined with all events being cancelled this summer, I finally decided to pull the trigger on an electric longboard. It's a lot of money, around 650 USD (plus gear, I love my brain too much not to use a helmet), but now after 2 weeks without weed, I see that in another 2 weeks I have already paid it off by the money saved on not smoking. This doesnt even take into account the cigarettes/paper/filters/junk food that came with the habit (pro tip, when _rolling papers_ becomes a noticeable expense, it might be time to reconsider some things).

If someone told me 2 weeks ago they'd give me a COOL AS FUCK electric longboard if I didnt smoke for a month, it would be a no brainer. I of course knew I spent a lot of money on weed, but since it's in increments every few days, it's hard to see the big picture. Even if I did the math, it was too abstract. Putting that money into something I could never afford with my old habit, something tangible I can see, hold, use, love, and in this case give me lots of joy for potentially years, which is great exercise and helps fill the days, made it a lot more real.

I'm not saying you should buy a longboard, or even spend the money instead of saving/investing. You might also not have nearly the same expense (I smoked about 1-2g a day), but for me it helps a lot to spoil myself a bit (or as I consider it, invest in happiness and healthiness) helped a lot in reminding myself that this should be my new normal. In theory I have 650 USD to 'waste' on whatever the hell I want, _every_ month for as long as I would have smoked.

I began smoking during a stage of major depression. I used weed to “cope” but it became a clutch, because instead of actively sorting  through my emotions, I suppressed. Since the act of smoking is so glorified w kids my age, it gets difficult to not give in sometimes. I’m learning to take it day by day, instead of trying to give myself milestones to reach because that’s simply too much for me to think about. I am able to admit that it has hindered my learning ability, it’s always been difficult for me to focus but I know my relationship with weed increased that inability. I do believe that drug use has helped me overcome many things emotionally and spiritually, but that does not mean I deem them as completely valid. A 15 year old should not be introduced to that kind of stuff, because at the age of 15 we do dumb shit. Around me I see teenagers developing unhealthy addiction to marijuana, coke, xanax, mdma, etc. It’s scary. Now marijuana may not be “that bad” but it still is something that can take a toll on ones health. I used to be under the mindset “it’s not that bad lol” and now i look at myself in the mirror and say “oh it’s not that bad but it caused you to steal out your own mothers purse and beg your friends for money huh?” and that’s when it all hits. How scattered and dependent you get when you let this plant, or any substance take over you. It’s saddening to see some of my “friends” only wish to hang out with me if I have some sort of substance. It’s become stale. And I am so fucking grateful I am able to realize this 2 years later, at the age of 17. Reading experiences of people over 21 who have been smoking for years wishing they didn’t really have helped me recognize how severe this all can end up for me if i continue a detrimental path. I have time to do all that shit when I am older, as of now I am 17 and I must focus on 17 year old things. I officially am letting go of a life that no longer serves me. I have so many people added on my snapchat who post daily constant videos of them in front of their camera smoking, and I realize that’s not the life I wish to live. I’m sure occasionally I may smoke here and there, but never again in the ways I’ve grown used too. It’s exhausting wanting to scrape all resin out a pipe, wanting to look at each inch of floor for any single piece of bud, it’s fucking dehumanizing. No more. I love and respect myself too much to allow myself to continue. And I will continue pushing towards this journey even if impulsiveness does creep in and I do relapse (which I have, many many times, but hey it all leads me back here) I will continue trying and trying again until I see myself through.",5,0

Honestly? This time my heart is really in quitting and it's made such a difference. I am having the occasional, mild-a little more intense craving in the evening (I was never a daytime smoker anyway) but have managed to distract myself by playing fucktons of video games with friends.

My sleep has been the most annoying thing; my best nights I get 7 hours, my worst I get 3-5. But that will improve the longer I'm sober.

I have been far more in touch with friends than I ever was before. I have been far more in touch with my emotions and dealing with any problems. I have a CLEAR HEAD in the morning! I've been eating better and keeping up with my exercise. I haven't managed to read a book yet... But that'll come too 😉

I'm just looking forward to improving even more. Every day I am sober is a day getting the great parts of myself back. I can do this, I will do this. And if you are also trying to quit, you can.

This community has really helped me. I am grateful for all the support and tips I've read and hope they'll keep me going in future if/when it gets tough.",5,0

Things have been rough lately due to staying home because of covid, a lot of you can relate. 

I could go back to my old job at Walmart, or find another job, but I'm still living with my parents. I'm 25. 

Part of quitting for me was getting my own life started, but the covid has been a huge curve ball. So I'm just surviving now and doing what I can to be productive. 

Some of the things I've been doing is meditation, running, wieght lifting, studying stuff about trading stocks. I've also been doing nofap, made it 14 days but failed a few days ago. 

I could go back to smoking and nobody would blame me with this situation but I'm going to stick with it. I've been on and off quitting since I was 19. There's always going to be a reason or excuse to going back to smoking. I just keep telling myself this has to work this time. You have to stop being a loser. You have to get it together. You have to prove everyone that counted you out wrong. 

As this motivational I was watching says ""You can have a plan all you want but life's going to hit you in the mouth and your why has to be greater than that punch. If you don't know your why you're going to get knocked out every single day""

I have never smoked a joint or a blunt for myself in just one straight smoke session but I have smoked a blunt in a period of 3-4 days. I wanted to explain that so you guys can understand how my relationship with weed was because even when my use wasn’t heavy I still hit the pipe or the bong very regularly every day. I smoked the most in my college time when I lived alone. In my house my family is Christian and so am I but for obvious reasons I use to hide it from them and I did it with success for 8 years but last December my dad catch me and it was the worst, I saw my parents so sad, and disappointed and I promise them that I won’t do it again. Now just to get it straight I actually have tried to quit weed myself a lot of times, and have had success for 2-3 months periods but always came back to it, it was really strange, sometimes when I smoked it I hated  it but when I leave it I cherished it. I don’t actually think weed is bad and I would love to have a healthy relationship with it but I just don’t know if that could be possible for me. I have a good relationship with a girlfriend that I love, I have an amazing family, I do really good at my job even tough i would actually like to get better at it. I actually think that what made suffer the most when I used to smoke was the fact that I had to hide it from everyone, it used to made me feel like I was living a double life, like if I was a bad person and that’s why I had to hide it, I used to feel ashamed and not worth of gods love. I have never donde dabs, edibles or nothing stronger so I actually think that I had some type of control. Now I think I’m about to be the best version of myself, I’m exercising a lot, I’m eating well and taking care of myself but today I made a big mistake, I was craving for weed since this coronavirus thins started and today I bought edibles even when I have never tried them before. My girlfriend and I wanted to do it and have fun but I’m feeling really bad already even when I haven’t even tried them already. I would describe what I’m feeling now as guilt, the sense of thinking a lot as I have to hide everything again because I’m leaving with my family until the coronavirus situation gets better and I’m kind of stressed, I feel like a bad person and I don’t know what to do. Please help, I don’t know if I hate weed or I hate having to show myself different than what I am and not feeling free. I was thinking about throwing away the edibles but fell also bad for spending the money. Sorry if this doesn’t make sense guys I just wanted to express myself, I’m writing from my kitchen as I spend time with my family but was feeling really anxious and need to talk to somebody so I feel like this post has no structure and is all over the place.

The good and bad (unfortunately),"I'm officially 1 year clean now and I'm a much better person than I was a year ago, however not everything  has gone to plan and there have been some negative consequences as well.
First a little background about me. I smoked pot EVERY DAY from the age of 16 until I was 40. So basically 24 years high. I'd smoke from the time I woke until I went to sleep. I loved pot. I was an ""enhancement smoker"" and preceeded every activity with getting high. I loved smoking and listening to music or watching films. I got high before sleep and before sex and before making any art and before anything else that I thought could be enhanced by cannabis. I made a nice little career for myself as a cannabis aligned artist and was selling my work for a good amount. 
I quit for a number of reasons, I was having panic attacks, major depression, anxiety, mood swings, sexual dysfunction, I was smoking up to an eighth a day, my art was getting worse, I was avoiding my kids because I didnt want them to see me constantly smoking, I had no motivation... the list goes on and on. Something needed to change, so I decided it was time to quit weed and get my shit together. 
    The first three months of not smoking were BRUTAL. Everything I used to use weed to ""enhance"" now became almost impossible to do. I couldn't sleep, and when I was finally able to, the dreams were horrific. I had no sex drive, I lost interest in music and films, I couldn't make art anywhere close to the level I one did and had no artistic drive. I had worse anxiety and depression than ever and was in a constant state of mild panic. 
Eventually things got better. Exercising and reading helped a lot. After awhile I started to not crave weed anymore and after maybe 6 months I started feeling better than I ever remember feeling. Life became wonderful again and I felt I could accomplish anything. I enrolled in college and so far have maintained a 4.0. (I barely passed high school with D's and C's). I'm the healthiest I've ever been and feel great. Seriously though I need to be clear on this.

Quitting cannabis was the best decision I've ever made. I've never felt better both mentally and physically. I'm accomplishing goals I'd never thought I was capable of accomplishing. 

I could use some advice though. I've gotten my life together but there are some things that I've lost in the process. My art. Without cannabis, my drive as an artist has failed me. I can't really reveal exactly what kind of artist I am without potentially giving my identity away, but basically I feel I can't continue doing what I did without being a pot smoker. 
Even worse I no longer feel a connection with my wife. She originally quit too, but relapsed after 2 weeks and has been smoking weed heavily ever since. I'm afraid that so much of our relationship was built upon a mutual love of marijuana that we have very little in common anymore. Whenever I look into her droopy stoner eyes I just long to be with someone sober. She spends most nights watching. Netflix and playing video games and it's just not attractive to me. We've got kids so for me working it out with her is the only option. But still, I have a hard time accepting that my relationship is with someone I no longer identify with for at least the next 10 years.

I'm hoping someone out there has some wise words for me. I'm never going back to smoking pot. But I need to find a way to move forward.  

TLDR; 1 year sober, I feel better than I've ever felt. My artistic career and marriage were built on pot however, and I'm afraid they are both now failing.",36,0

As the title says, I am 10 days sober. The first couple days were ok, and I didn’t have any nasty symptoms. On the fourth day, however, I started to feel pretty sick; terrible anxiety, depression, stomach pains, constipation, cold sweats, and insomnia. I truly felt like death, and I didn’t know how long it would last or if I was going to be able to tough it out. This lasted for about four days, which felt like much longer. 
	
About three days ago, though, I started to feel a little better. Gradually, my stomach felt better, I was able to sleep again, and the anxiety and depression began to lift. 
	
I’m making this post because when I was having a really hard time, I found words of encouragement on this sub, and I wanted to possibly do the same for someone who feels like they can’t do it. 
	
You CAN do it. DON’T give up. Just take it one day at time. Hell, take it one hour at a time if you need to. Get outside. Go for a walk. Just find ways to pass the time and I promise it will get better. I’m not saying your timeline will match mine, but I will say that when I was at my lowest, I truly believed I would never feel better. But I held on to hope, and I’m so glad that I did.

Other than that, I feel great. For the first time in about a year, I begin to feel healthy and energized. The lessons to remember here: exercise, it is really good for your general health and to help you quit. Also, don't do more than what you can do. You won't be able to walk for a while..",1,0

 I've been smoking for almost an year and 2 months. It was once in a week or two at first but since I already had severe PTSD due to losing both my parents at a young age. Especially my mother's passing scarred me alot. It was due to a car accident, very sudden and unexpected. I was referred for therapy multiple times but I never bothered to go.
 
  That's where Hash came in as a life saver. It helped me forget my worries and made life seem like old times. My intake grew when I broke up with my partner and it just threw me back to square 1.

 Currently, I do not smoke daily but whenever I have Hash I smoke multiple times till it finishes. It's almost like it helps me stay sane and without it I just can't get over my sadistic nature. I love my high self because it brings out the true me. Not a care in the world, free of the chains of society and relieved of all pressure. But not having Hash makes the situation worse and makes me realize I've grown somewhat addicted and it bothers me because this is not allowed in my relegion either.

What's the point of quitting now, I'm basically on house arrest anyways, I might as well enjoy it with weed. 
Its not a real problem because I can still do what I need to do ( of course this thought isn't even true) 
My whole family smokes so it couldn't be bad, it would be more isolating NOT to smoke.
It could work if I only smoked at night.
I just need a little break, then I can just be a social smoker again.  
It's can't possibly be that serious because it's JUST WEED. 

I feel like all of these thoughts are the biggest 'convincers' that send me back to my dragon. They minimalize the severity weed has had on my life for the past 10 years. They whitewash the pain of not achieving goals I've set because I've been too stoned. They inflate my sense of ease, convincing me it's not as bad as it could be, when in reality it's worse than it ever needed to be. 
Regardless, today I am sober. And I am happy with that. 

Anyone watched Brandon Novak's addiction story on YouTube?  It's helped a lot for me to realize I'm not alone fighting my brain. It's helped my to really accept the fact that the only control I have over weed is NOT smoking.

So I have been using cannabis on and off for 10 years now. I have only quit 4 times in my life. Twice during 2 pregnancies and twice since I've been with my partner. After I quit with my son I quit for 2 years, second pregnancy ended in miscarriage so ended up smoking as soon as I got back from the hospital. 3rd time I quit I quit for 2 months and 4th time I quit for 2 weeks and started up again. 

HELP! I've tried apps, they are great but progress seems slow so I give up. I'm sick of not remembering anything, I'm sick of feeling grumpy, lethargic and out of it. I am fed up of spending so much money on a plant! Its costing me a fortune and the high never seems as good anymore. I don't want to be a weed smoking mum, I want to be a good Mum with loads of motivation, money and to be calm without weed! 

The only thing that scares me is that I struggle with addiction and I'm scared that if I quit weed I will go onto something harder again. I just don't want to be this person anymore. I want to save up and travel, I want a nice house, a new car, a new PC. All of that has been put on the backburner because weed has been more important. 

I have 0 self-discipline or control. As soon as I get stressed I smoke again, I dont know how to calm down without it. I'm nervous about quitting in lockdown as well, how will I cope?

I want to first thank this entire community as well as each each individual that may read this, as it is the first time in 28 years I've been able to write my emotions without fear. 

I am a 28 year old male who has been married to my high school sweetheart since 2013! We have been together since 2010 and have two extremely handsome,  healthy boys. I make decent money and am a veteran of the United States Navy. We live modestly, but comfortably. To most people, I have a pretty awesome life....but what people don't know (besides my wife and close friends/ family) is that I struggle SEVERELY with marijuana addiction.

Before joining the military, I did what a lot of high school kids did in my town. I partied, smoked weed, drank, stayed up for days on end gaming and drinking energy drinks. Basically being a piece of shit, doing nothing with the many opportunities in front of me. It got to the point where my girlfriend (my wife now) and I wanted to have a more serious relationship and I had burnt most bridges to get anywhere in life by being a delinquent. This is when I said, ""Fuck it, I'll join the military."" 

My time in the Navy was honestly very enjoyable for the most part and I'll never replace the friendships I made or the experiences I had. With that being said, I unfortunately dealt with things that most people never will nor should have to deal with. This world has some dark places, but that can be saved for another time.  The point is, my time in was spent well and I have been out now for four years this month. Nearing the end of my service I started to get excited to move back home to Washington state and get to partake in marijuana once again. That's where I messed up.  

At this point my wife and I had our oldest son and a lot of saved money due to smart budgeting and money saved over deployments.  I got out of the Navy and about two weeks later I was a full time college student and smoking a weed vapor pen quite frequently. I told myself I could be productive and partake. I was wrong, very wrong. Here I am, almost 4 years later to the day of me getting out and I've been smoking flower, cartridges, oil everything day in, day out. We now have a second son and a third child on the way. Now dont get me wrong, I function very well to the point no one even knows I smoke besides my wife and close friends and I don't do it in front of my children. I am just to the point where I feel like I literally can not quit. Ive tried for the past two years with no success.  

I feel like marijuana has started to ruin my life, but I dont know how to change. It's like the simple answer is right in front of me... just don't buy more and stop. For me though, it's not that simple. The idea of quitting feels almost unreachable. Even with all the motivation in the world right in front of my stupid eyes, it hasn't been enough. It's just that I've realized I use marijuana to cope with many things. Physical pain. PTSD. Insomnia. Ive also realized I use it as a way to escape the very reality I am creating around myself. I also do it for fun though, since it's my old life style I've unfortunately started reverting to. Being a piece of garbage. I feel like I've started to let my wife down, myself down and most painfully my children. I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. I know I need to quit though. No matter how hard it is I have to do it. For my family and for myself. Its time for me to be more involved, eat better again, drink enough water, exercise, meditate, focus and accomplish things. I need to change my lifestyle completely and it starts NOW.

With the help of my wife, my close friends and family and this community I feel confident that I will turn my life around. Its time that I stop using weed as a crutch and face my demons. I must find a healthier way to ease my racing mind....I start today,  DAY 1 of my new life. My weed free life... it's finally damn time.",8,0

I first listened to this song when I was 21 and holed up on a serious marijuana binge in my apartment late at night.


I felt I was in a very similar situation to the man in the song, holed up, paranoid, sick, and trying to forget. Always drinking my tea alone. A life dedicated to incommunicable daydreams.


But sitting on a couch numb while your life passes by is a terrible thing.

I am/was pretty good about smoking after 7PM, work 9-5, workout and chores 5:30-7. Anyways after 1.5 years of this routine I think it has taken its toll. I frequently say no to social things I otherwise would do, my diet can get suspect, and lately it does not bring me the joy it once would. The first couple months of smoking was rather euphoric. I would cook good meals and try all sorts of things and loved trying it while high, I love movies, music, video games, walks or bike rides around the city or parks and being high would amp up the experience greatly.



Now I feel as though I’m caught in a habit of an addiction where it’s just routine. But now, instead of being happy and truly enjoying things it instead spikes  my anxiety and leads to over thinking things and I think has caused me to be depressed, something I’ve never felt in my life.

I'm on day 35 of quarantine, day 32 of sobriety.  Withdrawls were real, with fevers, chills, sweats, anxiety, and vivid nightmares.  

Today is a rough day and I just needed to reach out.  Most days I am able to focus on what I'm proud of:  sobriety, spiritual practices, working out every day.  But today is just really rough.  I didn't get the stimulus money that I was expecting.  I don't know how my business or my finances are going to look (income at zero - living off of my life savings, which won't get me all that far).  I realized yesterday that I shouldn't expect to get laid, or even make out or hold hands with someone, for the next 1-2 years because of this virus.  Great.  

On top of that, I have a whole lot of health anxiety.  Going to the mailbox is a big production for me, where I wipe down all the mail with bleach, strip clothes off outside, put the clothes straight in the laundry, run up to shower, etc.  Don't get me started on groceries.  I've barely left the house at all, which has people treating me like I'm crazy (that doesn't help).  I'm having nightmares almost every night.  My heart is so heavy with what I and everyone else is going through right now.  One of my friends who is a radiologist is likely positive and I am so worried for her, and so many others.  

I slept most of today to avoid the feelings.  I have a little bit of pot left, and a lot of wine, and am so tempted to use them to numb out.  I'm processing my own stored grief, plus fear/grief from this experience, plus the vibrational fear/grief of the world.  It's a lot.  I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders.  I just want to fall asleep and wake up when this whole virus is over.  

I know I'm not all that special in feeling this way.  Just had to get it off of my chest.  Thanks for reading.",7,3

Was supposed to go away a month ago (for a month - cancelled due to Covid-19) and the day I was supposed to leave (replacing one dopamine inducing experience with another) i thought ""I was supposed to go on holiday today, why not have a joint?"".

BAM! One month, an 1/8th every day and at least £1000 later I'm done. Currently smoking my two last joints in a row because I'm so addicted this. 

I buy an 1/8 every time because I think I end on a blowout. I also buy a full pouch of tobacco and throw it away/burn it because I'm convinced I'm done in my haze... I've even burnt weed! So the next day I buy an 1/8th, papers and tobacco... Almost £47! God help me. 

I know this is a ramble but I need this as some sort of visual proof of what a slave to a mildly addictive substance I am - the week before I relapsed I was in a bar telling a friend how I've never had such I high opinion of myself... That ain't true anymore.

For some reason I don't feel as fully committed as before, maybe it's because I broke my rib two weeks ago an another day ""I supposed to quit"" - another excuse.

&#x200B;

drugs have been around me my entire life. since I was born, every environment I was in was surrounded by drugs. truthfully, I am the son of a wealthy man and a very young innocent women who were never married. the latter's life was ruined by drug abuse, only introduced by the very man who promised to never betray her and fathered her child. i always knew drugs were bad because I could see it with my own eyes. I saw my mother and these people getting high, getting in trouble with the law and just not succeeding. as a kid I could see, this was bad, this is not how to live life. (my parents split when I was around 4, I lived with my mother in a drug infested environment until I was 11 when I moved in to my dads)

 just like most kids, I thought I would never drink or do drugs ever as they are stupid. turns out, I was mostly right. i don't drink, and probably never will. using alcohol as a means to achieve a ""high"" only to get shot down the next morning by a hangover, sounds idiotic to me. what's better? smoking weed. I always said to myself, ""drugs are stupid and make you stupid, preserve your brain"". I've always been a smart person, I see the world differently than most people. I would *never* do drugs. 

but yet, in my junior year of high school, my friends tempted me to steal from my dad's stash so we could smoke. we smoked some grade A quality bud right out of an apple. **bam**, there it was. after going my entire life of 17 years telling myself, *""you are the smartest, you are the best. drugs are for losers""* **I did it**. **I lied to myself**. **I made up truths in my head**, *""weed isn't harmful lol, it's just a plant, science says it has zero negatives compared to that of alcohol and tobacco, I'm still going to be successful and do everything I've ever said I would.""* don't we all know how wrong that is. 

(see, that's how it happens. human psychology. our own beliefs and truths can get so mixed up and crossed, especially when our state of mind is being influenced by lighting a plant on fire and inhaling the smoke. now, of course, the psychoactive ingredient in weed is THC and imparts a chemical reaction to achieve euphoria. but as we know, if it's too good to be true, it probably is. depression, slower motor functionality, and more and more are results of heavy prolonged use of marijuana. )

from that day, I smoked 3-4 big bowls **every single day.** here I am, a 17 year old kid who is still growing, who's brain is still developing, absolutely ripping fatties just destroying my life. The problem is, I was already a screwed up kid. My entire life is fucked. When I moved to my dads, I appeared as an entirely different person, different than who I was before. this image became stuck in my head, and I became this person. (it also didnt help I started to go by my first name, rather than my middle name which I've always gone by). I was bullied, had little friends, no girls were interested in me (people say I am an attractive person, I even won beauty shows as a kid... but here I am depressed, hopeless, I felt like I was no one). the people who tempted me to smoke, or person i should say, was someone I idolized and wanted to be. little did I know that person was someone I do not like at all. 

so my junior and senior year of high school was nothing but me constantly high, falling into depression and not accomplishing any academic work like I used to. \[my 4.0+ gpa ended at a 3.6. although my sat was 1430 (a 99th percantile score), Marijuana kept my **self esteem so low I felt like I was useless**. **I did not apply to any colleges.** I did not. Apply. To any colleges. My entire life this is what I planned for, im a smart ass im going to go to Harvard. I felt like I was useless, no school would want me. I had to sit by as my peer surpassed me, achieving #1 in the class and attaining a full ride scholarship to an Ivy League.\]

I have never used weed responsibly. I have an addictive personality type, I obsess over things and dream of something until I can manifest it or achieve what I want. of course if you do anything improperly, it is bad. if you can smoke weed once a week or once a day etc. and can control it, and it has no negative impact on your mind and body, great. but for me, I know what it does. I just want a reward, after the end of the day. But then I get it, and it becomes an **all-day, everyday occurrence.** 

so, I guess in conclusion. i have a fucked up life, very unusual and very bad for a child's development. I believe I definitely have some form of psychological condition, which contributes to my perpetually nonexistent self-esteem. I believe heavily smoking weed in a crucial time of neurological development has further contributed to my problems. 

the entire time writing this post all I can think is, this post is BS because I know I'm going to smoke some really nice green soon. this won't be true.

I felt I could not quit effectively unless I knew I Had weed to fall back on if there was no weed around I would just panic. Anyways, I am much more motivated to work when I am on the pot. I find it hard to do anything but watch tv, and watch youtube videos, and waste time because life is so empty and joyless. I haven't been sober for a long time, and my head started to get weird sensations from smoking, which is why I totally stopped. Things like I thought them was an earthquake, or violent shaking around me when it was just in my head. I never experienced anything like this from the pot and it scared me so much I told myself it was time to stop living this horrible life. That feeling in my head is all subsided 99% with some lingering effects. I know if I smoke weed It will bring back that intense mental pain in waves.  Anyways my head is much clearer, and I see life again. I suffered from derealization before but that seems to go away when I am sober. I just hate the way I feel, I have no comfort in my body. I just feel so damn irritable. I hope I can make it out without smoking, I just cannot function well sober. I function much better when I smoke pot..

I usually never post anything anywhere but I really felt like sharing my story about this, and hope for some feedback and see if anyone has had a similar experience to what I'm currently going through.

I've been a daily smoker since 2012. It began with 1-2 joints a day probably, and later turned into mixing hash with tobacco and doing bong hits all day every day for years. I live in Norway so hash is usually easier to get and get's you more baked (at least for me). I've ""quit"" many times over the years, sometimes one month, sometimes 5-6 months. But it always finds me. I always tell myself that I wanna be ""that guy who can smoke a joint now and then"". But I always end up on my couch smoking 10 joints a day and doing bong hits every single day for months. Hash or weed it doesn't matter. THC really is MY drug.

In October 2019 however, I was getting high on this terrible street hash and I suddenly started thinking obsessively about people that I used to hang out with in 2012-2013. It didn't end well between us and I really didn't wanna waste time thinking about people who I don't like and who doesn't like me. It also gave me real anxiety. But I couldn't stop thinking about them. It was really obsessive. I think it got triggered by me accidentally seeing one of them on FB and what a good life it looked like he was having, compared to me, who still had this huge drug problem, untidy apartment and so on. But anyways, I couldn't stop thinking about them and all the shit that happened back then. It was almost like my brain taunted myself with it, if that makes any sense.

After going like this for a week straight, saying their names in my head, probably a 100 times a day (I'm talking every 5-10 minutes, really obsessive).  I just threw away whatever hash/weed I had left. I really couldn't understand why this was happening and if I'd ever be able to not think about it every single day. How do you escape your own thoughts? It's impossible.

So I quit in October 2019. These thoughts continued every day for months (less and less every day). So it was getting slightly better, slowly but surely and now it wasn't really about thinking about the people, it was more about reminding myself that I hadn't thought about it for a while, if you guys understand.

New Years Eve came and guess what, I got offered a joint and again I thought ""I can smoke, I wanna be that guy that can smoke a joint on NYE"". I smoked and the obsessive thoughts started again when I was high at NYE. After that night I went back to being sober again.

When the new year came I got myself a new job, I was sober and the thoughts were getting fewer and fewer. Eventually it was probably one or two times a day that I reminded myself of it.

When February arrived my friend found this new pot dealer and you can guess what happened next. Slowly but surely I started smoking again just like I've always done. I still reminded myself multiple times every day of those obsessive thoughts.

I decided to quit again now in the start of April again after smoking intensively for 2 straight months. The obsessive thinking is still here now. It's one of the first things I think of when I wake up and it is one of the last things I think of when I go to sleep. 6 months after it began.

Obviously it got better when I quit and I truly only quit for about 2 months. But now I'm sitting here, haven't smoked in a week and I'm probably thinking about it 20-25 times a day if I had to guess.

I don't ever want to smoke again. I really don't. I can't believe how scary this is and I don't know if it will ever stop.

So my question is, if anyone reads this that is - Has anyone had a similar experience? What is the cause? And will I ever be normal again? Any feedback would be helpful...",6,0

I made a post recently about tips on improving breathing and lung health after smoking, however as I was writing I wanted to shift to some much needed optimism for those who feel hopeless or are in the dark.

For a time, I was dependant on weed. It was my avenue to escape, to enhance movies, games, sex etc. I was naturally curious about it and in the end I became the guy who would always justify his excuse to use it.

I would say that I dont think I have been hooked on weed as bad as some others in this forum, and I want to make that clear. Many of you have or are going through experiences I may not be able to imagine or fully relate to, but I want to remind you that the fact you are here should mean something to you. You recognized you have an issue, and there is a desire on some level that you want to change, become healthy and really discover who you truly are, and that is an admirable and courageous quality.

I discovered this addressing my porn addiction, but the process of recovery is a peak and dive process. Pending how much we are addicted, we can go on long streaks and then dive back in for a long time, and then try again. For those who may feel that the relapse means they wont recover, well.... I don't think so. Constantly failing when we try to give up the habit is part of the healing process, and that failure should be embraced. When you relapse, try to take note of your physical and social environment, look at  your physical and mental state, were you stressed, were you scared, were you sad etc. These are all factors that we may not recognize every time we relapse, and if anything I want you to be aware of that. Dont look at failure as black and white, it's an opportunity to learn.

Lastly and more importantly, and this I really feel a need to stress, for the people in here who are in the process or for the ones who get knocked down BUT WILLINGLY go again, you portray an act of courage, meaning and faith that I would argue many people will never have to go through. To battle an addiction in a way is to battle one's self, and many people out there succumb to that inner battle. By taking action and overcoming these urges because we believe there is something more meaningful, in my opinion makes you stand out from the average person. To come back out of the fire, to come back from a personal hell, to bring the score back when down by 5. Your commitment and success to your recovery is what will inspire many people to be better versions of them selves. So for the ones who have recovered, thank you for encouraging urging us to the finish, for those on the journey keep the eye on the prize, for the ones yet to start, as cliche as this may sound, dare to be great and set the example better than the ones who did it before.

To better health and I'll see you all at the finish line,

Have had a few long breaks in there, a couple months when getting drug tested about 7 years ago, and a couple international trips where I was off for a month, but was also drinking every day on those trips. Currently my longest totally sober break in a while at about two weeks, and honestly it has been going really well (I’ve got some life factors that are especially motivating for me to stay off which helps). 

Usually when I’ve tried to stop before, my inability to sleep without it has what’s brought me back, I’ll have several sleepless nights or unable to manage a good sleep schedule and I’ve broken down and returned to smoking. This time, I’ve gotten through that phase and am experiencing the opposite. I’m sleeping great and super deep and finally dreaming for the first time in years (so vivid), but I honestly feel like I could sleep all day every day. I feel so much more mentally clear and am not waking up with that patented cannabis fog the next day, but I could easily sleep 10 hours every day and feel like I’d still be able to take a nap an hour after waking. Anyone else have this experience? Maybe my sleep has been so shitty for so long that I’m just catching up on years of bad sleep?

This may be a long post so bear with me. 

  
I have recently quit weed due to a joint which my doctor believes resulted in a severe allergic asthma reaction. My smoking habits were on and off from highschool up until college (in which I didnt smoke any weed for about 5 years), then i gradually started smoking weekly then in the past 2,5 years it was daily small joints (i never had a good ""high"" tolerance so less would get me high).   


At any rate fast forward to 1 month ago and I smoked a pre rolled joint from a dispensary and started to have some obstructive breathing and a wheeze on exhale which got pretty bad so now I am using inhalers to both open the air way and another inhaler to keep the lung inflammation at bay. I have never had asthma before so this experiences has been traumatic to say the least. It has been a month since the incident and no weed. The experience has been so negative that it has turned me off from weed entirely. I know some people trying to quit in here have a strong dependency on weed, but use my experience as another reason to quit. You dont know what if feels like to be out of breath for an entire damn month.   


So on a positive note, I know Im going to get through this. I recently turned 30, my habits were smoking small joints on and off and then chronically, and as the research suggests (and from reading some of your experiences) I am going to get better physically and mentally.  I was catastrophising before but I think I am lucky because in comparison to others I smoked alot less. I have been the type of dude to make a gram last 2 to 3 weeks lol. So fingers crossed its not so bad.     


So now to my question, for those of you that have successfully quit or have had long streaks without smoking weed, what was your breathing improvement process like and what would you recommend to help  nourish the recovery process? I reached out to a reddit user already who was nice enough to give me his experience and detailed methods for navigating recovery. I would be interested in getting more perspectives if you guys would be willing.   I have noticed that I have some chest congestion (in addition to the trouble breathing) and I have coughed up some mucus but it is clear or white, not colored like some other peoples experience.  


Any advice on the recovery process would be welcomed, appreciated and valued. Lastly any advice to improve lung function would be really good.   


Thanks and God bless,

For one, I stopped checking all the bad news like a fiend and started feeding my brain better stuff, reading 50 pages of a writer I love, and watching two movies with better focus. Add to that meeting my goal of writing 1000 words and avoiding the constant stream of candy, snacks, smoke and soda.

I am currently 25 years old and I am free from weed for officially over a week now, although it feels like two weeks (and more!) as I was severely reducing my usage the week prior to that. I was a chronic daily user for about the past 3-4 years. It was a real turbulent, dependent relationship. It most certainly made my anxiety, depression, and other underlying mental problems worse for me.

It's a very long story. My introduction to it was in my last semester of my senior year in high school. I was raised pretty conservatively in a Korean household and went to an all girls high school, needless to say quite sheltered, although I explored outside of that quite a bit through the use of the internet and self exploration. Two acquaintances/friends at the time had a joint and I had my first pull. I didn't feel anything as some people experience from the very first few times.

The next time I had used was in my first year of university (19) when I was hanging out with friends (non university friends, I was socially awkward and couldn't make any). We decided to go to my nearby old elementary school at night and we smoked a joint. That time I felt it. And I instantly freaked out - perception of time was completely in shambles, intense anxiety about being found out by my parents, feeling like this wouldn't end, etc. And so, of course I didn't do it on my own at this point.

(Age 20) It became enjoyable when I had gone to my (then) boyfriend's home and had enjoyable high moments with him and his brother because it was a relaxed environment and we would play Magic.

After the inevitable break up (it was an unhealthy relationship and I had serious inner work to do, hence was attracting the wrong sort of people), I began using weed more socially with some of my friends because it was enjoyable to me. However, I quickly became more apathetic when I was on it and off of it. Which affected my relationships quite a bit.

Around age 21/22 I began using on my own, at this point I had a lot of issues due to this. It made me complacent, my grades dropped due to my anxiety and depression getting much worse and me not addressing it. Also I was dependent on weed. It numbed me out to my intense emotions (I have bpd). Needless to say, this only exacerbated my problems because I was only covering up the urgency of my problems and avoided things.

I was dependent on relationships and on weed. I had moments of breaks - 6 months I forced myself to quit, this was around the time I met my second boyfriend (first serious relationship; he was straight edge, occasional beer, that's about it and a pull sometimes). I was reintroduced to weed but in a more friendly way, via his friend who smoked very often and also sells weed - it's that guy's entire life. And so, I began to use socially again and eventually on my own.

I had so much inner work to do, past trauma I needed to heal from, family wounds, healing my pain body, building self respect and self love. But I couldn't see that because I was so dependent on weed and was under the illusion that it was helping me because it helped me feel less ""needy"" and more ""antisocial"" which was much more detrimental to my health and wellbeing.

My relationship lasted around 3 years, I didn't see that it was toxic and emotionally abusive which eventually became physical and the law got involved.

Weed had covered up a lot of emotions for me and made me complacent. It also reinforced completely unhealthy cycles for me. Perhaps it helped at first with my eating disorder, making me feel more chill (ONLY at certain few limited times), etc. But then it quickly backfired and I was using it to cycle on my mental health issues such as using it to stuff my face and binge and purge or to completely abstain from eating, to play hours upon hours of video games and ignore the feeling of anxiety because I would tunnel in, and it would make me feel OK and satisfied with repeatedly binge watching and rewatching useless stupid shows that weren't benefitting me. Just sitting there and vegetating.

I had intense feelings of wanting to quit, hate towards it, however so many times I failed.

I was able to quit because I had an inner shift in myself, I truly saw that it was keeping me stuck in life and was ruining my body, mental well being, absolutely detrimental to my emotional growth.

I quit both alcohol (I drink in moderation, still working on lessening the frequency of days in a week) and weed officially. Luckily, the flu actually helped me to detox (quicker - all the sweating) and quit.

I can honestly say that I have had an accelerated growth spiritually, I am doing the things I loved and was essential to growth - reading tonnes, watching documentaries, focus on intellectualism (an interest of mine), getting into meditation and spirituality. My relationships are SO MUCH BETTER; I can finally heal and work on my family relationships that were ruined due to other things but not discounting drug use. I am not ""antisocial"" as I once believed I was and can see that I am a social creature who needs healthy relationships.

More than anything though, the self respect, self love I have gained from quitting is immense and truly satisfying. I have been working on boundaries and self love for most of my young adult life and kicking the weed to the curb was absolutely essential for me to get past a barrier into higher consciousness. I feel like ME again. With my interests and FEELING, I can now see that there is nothing wrong with having emotions and EMPATHY. I covered up those feelings because it so easily hurt me, but I can see now that they are gifts that I need to harness :). I truly feel zero desire to go back to the hurtful lifestyle I was living.

I am now returning to school to finish an undergraduate degree in September and know that I can now properly face my problems such as anxiety in the classroom, time management and study habits because weed is out of my life (about time, however, I realize it is now the right time).

Side note: One of the reasons why I had trouble quitting was definitely in part because of denial. I loved it, I loved the feeling of it and I didn't want to give it up. I wanted to be able to use it ""responsibly"". However, that thinking and reluctance to truly let it go was what was keeping me in that cycle. Something a cognitive prof said in class once really stuck with me: how much BETTER would you be without it? (use/dependence on something even if you are able to be functional and complete all your responsibilities and work)

I'm 17, and weed has become a more and more important part of my life for the last 3 years. I haven't remembered my dreams in 3 years, because I've never gone to bed sober. Weed has been present everyday, every night after dinner, in every social occasion, every time I simply went outside with friends, then that small joint while doing household work, and after that as a reward - obviously after studying too, everytime I was to take a shower as a feeling booster (along with music). Sometimes I'd even roll myself a micro joint only because I felt the need to poop and enjoyed smoking on the toilet. That's how much it's part of my routine. For me, it's just... *there*, it just... *IS*. 

And I've gradually anesthetized myself because I felt more than I could handle when I was 14, and now I'm here at 17, and my problem is feeling too little. I'm, consciously, slowly killing *something* in me, that I probably won't be even be able to indentify properly until the day I either quit or fuck myself up too bad. In any way I can put it, I know I'm doing something I shouldn't to myself.

I'm losing memory, sensitiveness and sensibility. I'm losing perspective upon my life and myself, I'm losing interests and dreams (literally. I'm missing out everything that happens in my head while I sleep. Big chunk of life that won't ever come back). I'm losing my enthusiasm and love for everything I used to have, firstly for myself. 

I can't phisically go on, I can't afford to, because I've realized that I surely have some kind of actual, physiological malfunctioning in my brain, partly genetic partly trauma-related, which I've been trying to self-medicate for the last 3 years. My neurotrasmitters are screwed up just by themselves, and in order to avoid that feeling of emptyness this condition causes me, I'd rather just blast them with THC and cross my fingers hoping it'll do, but at this point, I know. It doesn't work.

I've been wanting to quit it for more than one year, and haven't even gone a day without it yet (except when I just didn't have any around, very rarely) because of how much it's present in my own small world. Everyone around me smokes it. I have basically an unlimited supply of the finest quality, that I can reach whenever I want, without having to hide it from anyone, as it is accepted and part of daily life in my household. 

My mother (with whom I now have cut off all contacts because she's a terrible person to be related to, she's an abusive mother and we both just don't have any desire to talk to each other, at all) had epilepsy, and started using cannabis medicinally, for very good reasons (smoking weed instead of having to take barbiturates is a good reason for sure) in her 20s, but over time her usage turned into something else: it had become her only reason to live outside of me, but since we haven't talked to each other in two years, I now must be less important than weed. 

While I couldn't be aware of them, I picked up all her addictive behaviours involountarily as a child. They're imprinted in me. She smoked like a chimney throughout all of my pregnancy. I was born full of THC, drank her THC filled milk for about 3 years, and have always seen her smoke weed all day since birth, every summer she would plant it and have me look after the plants, and she never really explained to me what weed really was. Ever. She just told me ""that's my medicine"", and that was it. See what I meant? Weed just *was* since i can remember I was alive. And you know what's funny? She got FURIOUS at me when she first found out I smoked weed. She said ""I don't know how something like that could have even come to your mind!"". Excuse me?

My mother is exactly who I do not want to be, so it's gonna be a very good reason not to smoke: I don't wanna be like my mother! I don't wanna perpetrate her faults. I wanna prove her she was wrong, that I'll become a thoughtful, realized and independent person. Prove to myself that I am stronger than her.

My father, on the other had has been heavily addicted to any hardcore substance known to man before I was born, now he only smokes and manages to do so and function perfectly. He's a wonderful father and person but he's, simply, an addict by nature. But he's found a way to keep his shit together regardless of said nature. He just needs weed in order to live his life even if he has done his homework and reached a balance. I don't have any problem with that, and I fully understand and respect him and his choices, but I don't wanna end up like him. I know I can choose not to. I've surely inherited a lot of his addictive traits, but I am positive it is still entirely possible for me to grow into a happy non-addictive way of living.

In conclusion, wanna reach adulthood with my very own brain, not with one affected by a substance, no matter which is it. I want to go to sleep every night unbothered by my behaviours, and simply dream like everyone does.",16,0

But after many failed attempts and dealing with severe depression during withdrawals, I decided to be more strategic. I was unhappy with my job and the country and culture that I’m in. 

Been working on creating a better situation. I quit my job and started my own business. I’m on my last few months in this country. And the days are getting warmer, meaning more time outside and away from the comfort of smoking inside. I was in an amazing place mentally, creating a really strong foundation to quit.

Then coronavirus happened. 

The country went into a strong lockdown. I lost half of my business. I have only been able to go outside once in the past month and a half. This is NOT the time to quit, but as I ran out and can’t risk going outside without a heavy fine or jail time, I’ve been thrown into it. 

I know it could be a good thing, and I’m taking it in strides. The first 3 days were rough, wild mood swings and depression, finding it hard to work the few hours I have left. There are (in theory) ten days left of the quarantine, and even then, seems like everybody is dry. It will be an interesting experiment to see if I relapse, as this is the first time I have been forced to quit.  

Today feels better. For the first time in three days I woke up and felt...normal. I’m sober and it feels ok, I’m not feeling completely depressed and negative. I really hope this trend continues! Because honestly, smoking helped a lot with the absolute crushing boredom of being inside all day everyday. 

Anyway, I know I’m not the only having trouble, and I’m grateful to still have some kind of income. Lots of love!",5,4

I have smoked weed heavily since I was about 14 years old, I am now 26. I smoked it all the way through university, where I would get high and not attend lectures, which definitely will have affected my grades - but I carried on anyway and left uni with an average grade, knowing I probably could of done better if I wasn't smoking daily.

When I look back, my weed smoking has ruined relationships as that would always be my priority, and would always determine my mood. Here in the UK (although it is getting better), there is still an attitude that if you smoke weed you just fall into the 'drug user' category with a lot of people - and you may as well be smoking crack as well to some people.

I am in the process of trying to start my own business, and I feel I have good ideas. But then I'll smoke and I wont want to leave my comfort zone, and I'll just forget about it and stick on the TV or something instead. I have limited myself from meeting new friends and new experiences - all because I wanted to just sit at home at get high instead.

I am now a father, and I wouldnt want my son to be exposed to anything and also want to set an example. There is also the health implications that 12 years of heavy smoking will have, on the lungs for example. Not to mention the money I spend every week.

I have had many attempts to quit that have eventually failed, a lot of the time it is because I think I can just have the odd spliff with friends and it will be okay, but I always somehow slip back into smoking everyday and being fully dependant.
 
But right now I am down to my last spliff, and I am ready try and quit again. I feel that with the current pandemic it will be easier to stay away from friends that smoke, I will just have to keep busy and always keep in mind that I am taking positive steps.

Not sure how this works, but it has been very therapeutic writing it all down.",1,1

""ok so I quit weed 5 days ago and it was the biggest mistake of my life. I thought I was helping myself by getting sober, but the only thing I induced was chronic pain. I started clenching my jaw because I had so much anxiety from quitting and now my Jaw feels unbearable.

My advice is keep the veil on and never quit so that you don't have to see how shitty sober life is. I wish I went back to before I tried to stop.

I really feel like I need to use this time to push through this addiction and finally move past this very long phase of my life. I have practically no passions left in life and I believe the state that I have put my brain into through the daily abuse is what has been causing me to have unrealistic expectations of what everyday life can be like.

I have an overall negative outlook on life even though my life is relatively comfortable compared to a lot of the struggles that many people have to go through just to survive.

When you stop wearing your mask you expose your self to elements that have been hidden for a long time. 

You may get anxious, sad, and even angry. If you let these feelings be and what causes them you will keep going back. You must fix your life. 

You must not go about your same old life when quitting cannabis. You must work again. You have to lift your self out of the hole you have been digging. 

1. Stop your old habits 
Love your self, show your self respect. Wake up at a reasonable hour, eat right, and most importantly work out! 
2. Learn the reasons why weed is bad for YOU
Not for other people but specifically for you. Think about it for a while. Ponder.
3. Do not make deals with your self
Stop telling your self this is the last joint, last bowl etc.
4. Finally come to the conclusion that weed is NOT helpful to you or your future 
You must come to a conclusion that weed is not your life. Your life is not controlled by it.

Keeping this all in mind, this is the perfect time to quit but also very stressful. With all the sad news lately it feels very hard to quit or to stay sober. You must be strong. It will show your body and mind how to act when in trouble. 

And finally as a last piece of advice, STOP hanging with your friends or people in your life that smoke. Seriously. Some may be able to stay sober while keeping a relationship with these stoners. While others may not. Most will not.

I just want to get my story out-there in words to help others who might relate to not feel alone going through this and to help myself realize why I need to quit even more. I also want to get this all sorted out so I can stop thinking about this.

I first tried it around the end of my sophomore year (march 2017) of high school and remember really disliking it. Everything felt slow and I could barely walk after taking only 2 hits. At this time, I was really into taking Vyvanse that I bought off classmates because I felt like it fixed all of my problems and insecurities. Ever since the beginning of high school I felt like I was not that outgoing or confident because I didn’t have many friends and I had trouble meeting new people. I kept to myself most of the time, talking only when I had to because of group assignments and things like that. The feeling of being alone really bothered me and I wanted to do anything to stop it. After my friend gave me some Vyvanse as payment for doing an assignment of his, I finally felt “normal”. I went to school being extremely talkative, confident giving eye contact and actually doing the work in class instead of procrastinating. I felt “normal” and like everything I would want to be. This happened frequently until the beginning of senior year when a girl I was after found out I took that and felt like I was going to be a bad influence on her (turns out I am). Plus, the comedowns were the worst thing I have felt. Please don’t take any recreationally. After that happened, I swore to myself not to take it anymore and I haven't since. Also during this time I was really into acid and used to it to ""try and fix my life"" , by this it was finding things in my life that can improve to feel better about myself. also trying to find a way to open up from my shell and actually build a healthy social life instead of being the weird awkward quiet guy that I felt like I was.

After I stopped taking Vyvanse and acid I  was at a low point in my life. The only girl I ever got close to was gone and I was back to spending my days not doing much of my homework and distracting myself with YouTube and video games. 

Around October I was hanging out with my friend and he brought his friend who happened to have a THC cartridge with him. (these were so common at my school that year, especially the black-market ones). After we were done hanging out, as payment for the gas we used driving around, he decided to let me borrow the pen for the night. I used it, liked it and wanted one.  The rest of my high school life was spent hitting carts in class and only hanging out with people that smoke. Whenever I left my house or hung out with anyone, I was high or got high. My life revolved around it. I stopped putting my already limited effort into school and I just coasted by. I smoked all day until I fell asleep. Even sometimes smoking so much that I passed out at 9pm just to wake up at 4am and hitting the cart again to go back to sleep until school started. Weekly I would buy a half gram off a student at the school. I had my routine. It makes me not care about anything and be fine with doing nothing. I spent hundreds of dollars a month on carts and since I didn’t have a job, I started selling my stuff on ebay to get more money to keep up my habit. I sold my shoes, anime figures, and stuff that I didn’t REALLY need. This went on and it was now the end of the school year. I didn’t do any homework and didn’t study for any tests, but I had to pass my math final to graduate. I was really stressing out. All my other classes were fine with solid D’s but math I was failing and needed above a 62% on the final to pass the class. I was so stressed out and realized smoking along, with my actions, were the reason why I was close to not graduating on time. I put the most effort I ever did during all of my high school career and got a 67% on that final. I remember being so happy that I passed and being excited that I can enjoy my summer. I told myself that I was going to quit but that failed HARD.

Summer came and right from the beginning of it I found out the hard way that the carts that I have been smoking since the beginning of the year were probably not what I thought they were. The person I brought them from advertised them as being from a dispensary and legit. I believed him until I got my hands on a cart that WAS from the dispensary. Compared to the street one the real one actually made me tired and relaxed me. the street ones just made me feel different and weird, not really tired. I was so concerned for my health that I tried to quit but told myself that I was going to taper off with the legit carts. Didn’t do that. I kept on buying them and telling myself that “this is the last one”. Also, during this time, I got myself a ‘girlfriend’ that long story short, hated my friend and made me stay home all the time. She didn’t know I smoked, and I tried to keep it that way. So, I spent that summer just alone in my room, extremely high and doing nothing at all. I just texted and called her (she didn’t want to see me because she was mad but that’s another very long story). Also, during this time, I started to write in a journal to keep track of how I was feeling and to just write my thoughts down. Whenever I left my house, I was high or going to get more so I can stay high. All of my smoking and substance use was hidden from my family. I smoked at home many times too. Out the window and in the garage. I hated to do it because I was paranoid that I was going to get caught. I usually smoked only carts because of the convivence. While spending all this time alone, I notice I started to reflect more on my life. I wanted to try to understand how my life has gotten to this point and why I even use substances in the beginning. I realized that I just wanted to be accepted more by others and I felt like me trying different substances can help me feel better, maybe even get out of my shell more. It honestly didn’t work and made things worse from me because I feel so lost in life right now. I’m still cruising through life, when I need to be making turns and decisions on what path I need to take for my future. I don’t remember much from that summer, but I do remember thinking how much more fun my previous summers were. College was coming up for me and I told myself that If I wanted to not repeat high school, I was going to have to quit. That didn’t happen. I kept on getting more carts, justifying it as “being the last one”. 

College started and I continued my bad habit. Waking up, rushing to get ready because I procrastinated getting up on time, getting high, and going to class. Lucky for me the classes were surprisingly less demanding than high school. That kinda made me feel like I could continue because if I got good grades, it can’t be bad right? I didn’t realize but me doing what I wanted and not caring much for life made me really distant from the already small group of people I was friends with. Whenever I rarely hung out with them, I was high. I wasn’t my true self around them because I was always high. One thing about me and getting high is i get really quiet when I high because I feel like It calms me down way too much and just makes me “chill”. Not really alive and energetic, wanting to do things. I was fine with whatever along as I’m high or going to get high. During my classes I payed little attention and barely knew what was going on. I didn't meet one person and kept to myself the whole time.

A month later update. I wrote this about a month ago and never had to drive to finish it. I kept on smoking and since I wrote this and spent over 400$ in a month on this addiction of mine. Now that quarantines are a common thing, I have had all the time in the world to rethink all of my life and how I got to this position. This situation of mine started way before high school and can be traced to when I was younger. Looking back at my life im starting to think I have an addictive personality. Whenever I got into something I'm OBSESSED with it. for example I really was into csgo , so much so I spent 100s on cases and skins and put 1k+ hours into it. Now I dont even have it installed anymore, another one is prince. I got into princes music last June and hes the only music ive been listening to even to this day. I now know what I really need to get drug use out of my life. I want to know and get in touch with the real sober me and actually have a personality instead of weed being the only thing I do. its going to be rough but this post will keep me accountable to stop smoking. Plus I have no more money. thank you for reading",7,1

I was a really bad picker at my skin, the day i quitted weed i also stopped picking, but before that my skin wasn’t that bad it was just scabs, but now my face is just covered with horrible acne, I have searched for answer everywhere and there is none, is this due to my body detoxing it self? I really don’t understand, if anyone has a answer or some advice i would really appreciate it. And i know this doesn’t have anything to do with withdrawal but I can’t find answers anywhere else, I was just wondering if anyone else has had this problem, and how long does it last? 
Thank you again for reading😊",4,0
730,2020-04-14 18:07:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g1f051/should_i_quit_altogether/,Should I quit altogether?,"I'm at a crossroads. I'm 23, been smoking since I was 19, and for the last 2 years has been daily/every other day use. When I get high I beat myself up about how I shouldn't be smoking this much, and think of all the things I should be doing instead (my wife and I are learning Norwegian in hopes to visit/move in the next 5 years or so, and I've been working on ideas for a video game I've been wanting to make for awhile but I have no actual skill in that field). But the problem is, I can't do those things when I'm high. If I know what I'm doing then tasks are no problem under the influence, but learning a new language or skill is almost impossible.

I still practise the language sober, but haven't made any progress towards the game, mostly because of the anxiety of the sheer challenge that it is. But I don't have much motivation to do these life bettering things while sober, and only while high do I decide I need to do something productive about it.

It's not that my life is a mess or I'm spending a ridiculous amount or anything like that. I smoke often but in very small amounts. I've worked my way up from grunt to managing a warehouse of a building material distribution center, while smoking most evenings. I've gotten us on budget to paying off our student/consumer debt and every pay cheque puts us that much closer to being debt free. I feel like I'm doing extremely well in life especially for my age and where I was even 4 years being a stupid 19 year old. I've always been a gamer and my favourite thing to do is play video games, and when applicable get high and play video games. 

I honestly can't tell if weed is making me put less effort into areas of my life, or if it's just making me realize how little I'm doing. There are times where I think quitting for good is the best thing for me and I think about where I could be by the time I'm 30 if I stay sober, but I also don't feel like it's the worst thing to do, and there's really nothing wrong with smoking in the evening and I just need to do more before I get high. But most days I find myself waiting for the time I can go smoke. My wife smokes with me, albeit less than I do, and I don't see her having any issues with it. We live in a basement suite and our neighbours above us also smoke so I'm surrounded by pot smokers who (as far as I know) aren't fuck ups in life, which reinforces the idea that it's totally fine, while also making it incredibly difficult to commit to cutting back seeing everyone enjoy it and continue to live their lives.

I don't know, I guess I just want to hear other opinions and personal accounts as I really don't have anyone to talk to about this. I've talked to my wife and she doesn't think I have a problem, but also supports me if I want to quit, but would still like to smoke herself. I don't even know if I want to quit. I've been having mental debates with myself for a few months about this and I needed to put it in writing. Thanks to anybody who takes the time to read this and respond",2,0

733,2020-04-14 16:35:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g1dccy/the_journey_begins_day_1/,The Journey Begins: Day 1,"I'll preface this by saying that I was diagnosed with GAD and depression in December of 2017 but I suspect these diagnoses were with me long before that. I have been on medications since that diagnosis and have most recently found a combination that seems to work for me. Through all of this, I have relied on marijuana as a release and a crutch. I smoked for the first time during my sophomore year of high school and absolutely fell in love with the way it made me feel and the safe haven it provided me. I smoked on and off through high school but never really felt like it controlled my life. All that changed once I left for college.

I joined a fraternity and from there on, my drug use skyrocketed (not just weed). I turned into a habitual smoker, all day every day, and thats when things started to turn for the worse. I started to really struggle with depression and anxiety in the fall of my junior year of college, which is when I decided to go on medication and start going to therapy. I had stopped smoking for 6 months before this happened because I suspected they were related. Then I went to study abroad in Spain and the smoking started again due to access to REAL weed, the smoking clubs in Barcelona were something I'd never seen before and I fell in love with weed again. I was going to therapy and on medication so I felt like I could coexist with weed. Then the moles (tobacco and weed in a bong) started. From here on out, I was an absolute fiend. The addictive properties of the tobacco combined with THC sent me into a spiral. I was hooked and my senior year of college went by in a blur, I even started selling weed to support my habit moving a quarter pound every two weeks. I graduated college in May of 2019 and then went to Thailand for the summer. Weed laws in Thailand are archaic so I didn't touch the stuff save for one weekend in the islands where it seemed more relaxed. When i got back, I got a job and an apartment, and yea you guessed it, i got a bong too. I started smoking very heavily again but i somehow found the willpower to quit moles so it was just greens from then on.

This brings us to today. Being quarantined has opened my eyes to how destructive my THC use has been to my mental health. I've have no motivation do things, no ambition to advance my career, and i've been content and complacent. Despite this, the past few weeks have been good in the sense that I have had this realization that the thing I thought was helping me was actually hurting me. Being quarantined has essentially forced to come to this conclusion and its fucked up but I'm kind of grateful for it. The past few weeks have seen me start reading again, journaling every day, get a coloring book, 100+ pushups every day and meditating for 5 minutes when i wake up and when i go to bed, all while mulling over this decision to quit smoking weed. I started tapering down my daily usage and even had a 48 hour period where I didn't smoke. I felt clearer and the world outside seemed brighter which gave me optimism that this is the right path for me.

I finished the last of my weed and kief last night and am now officially embarking on my journey towards a THC-free life. Ive also downloaded the Grounded app. I am also selling my bong to a friend of my younger brother in an effort to reduce urges. I don't know if I'll smoke weed again, I like to think that one day I will have my life and mind in order to the point that I could smoke responsibly and in moderation. But that's a discussion for another time. I'm not looking back. I am proud of myself for doing this. I am reclaiming my life. I can do this!

A recent breakup has caused me to re-evaluate my entire life, and as such, I've made this difficult decision to eliminate this source of shame. Here's what I've come up with:

1. My dependence on smoking weed has cost me thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars.
2. My dependence on smoking weed has prevented me from traveling to places where weed is not available.
3. My dependence on smoking weed has affected my desire to eat and sleep, such that both are difficult without it.
4. My dependence on smoking weed has limited my friend group, as I only want to hang out with people that also smoke so I can too.
5. My dependence on smoking weed has kept me tethered to my house or apartment so that I can continuously smoke throughout the day.
6. My dependence on smoking weed has not been healthy, as much as I convince myself it’s not that bad.
7. My dependence on smoking weed has affected my ability to think clearly and articulate my thoughts.
8. My dependence on smoking weed has caused me to do things like sneak vape hits in the bathroom at family dinners, family trips, etc.
9. My dependence on smoking weed has made me too complacent with being lazy and doing nothing.
10. My dependence on smoking weed has caused me to go home on lunch breaks from work just to smoke; when living in NYC, this became extremely expensive with the use of Uber.
11. My dependence on smoking weed has led to being careless with storage of it, and both dogs I have owned eating some and having a bad time.
12. My dependence on smoking weed has made me less social than I already am.
13. My dependence on smoking weed has caused me to lie to people due to embarrassment about where I am going or where I was, when I had to go buy more.
14. My dependence on smoking weed has put me in potentially dangerous situations.
15. My dependence on smoking weed has kept me in a perpetual fog when I would smoke before doing absolutely everything, first thing in the morning, last thing at night, etc.
16. My dependence on smoking weed has prevented me from truly feeling, as I am constantly numbing one thing or another.
17. My dependence on smoking weed has made me forgetful, aloof and spaced-out.
18. My dependence on smoking weed has made me paranoid, constantly wondering if people know I am high, if my eyes are red, if I smell like smoke, etc.
19. My dependence on smoking weed (until recently) has put me in constant jeopardy of legal issues. In 2012 I was arrested for possession of a 1/4, and went back to my dealer the next day to rebuy what was confiscated.

Ever since that first puff I had smoked every single day up until about 4 days ago when I finally worked up the willpower and just stopped. I have many many reasons for wanting to stop but that not why I'm here today.

What I really wanna talk about is how much harder on my body this process is than I initially thought it would be. Of course going into this I knew the basics, my sleeping might get a little messed up, maybe wont have to great of an appetite, maybe even head aches or fatigue. And let me just say it's all of this and more.

From day one of no pot, the first thing I noticed was my body having a very hard time regulating temperature. I find myself constantly opening and closing my window, setting up fans, or removing/adding clothing. I'm always either sweating like crazy or freezing to the point I don't want to move. Then a another day in and I start getting the digestive issues, I havent been able to finish a single meal all week, but I prefer this to the times when I can't eat at all. These have so far been my most prevalent issues (thankfully only minor insomnia [so far]) and they tend to get worse and worse the further into the day.

Now with all that being said, I have setup a very good system for myself to track my progress and I dont see myself relapsing at all, I know I just need to make it roughly a month and I should start to feel better, but man, this is definitely,  so much harder than I expected.

You have been getting high each and every day of your life, for many months or for many years.

Your whole life is centred around getting high.

You first get high even to do your mundane tasks.

Your life has narrowed down to enjoying only when you are smoked up.

You are always thinking about your next dose even after getting high.

You have tried moderation, but very soon, you are back to your old self.

You become irritable, bad-tempered and fearful when you are going to run out of your stock.

Your closest buddies are the ones who indulge in weed or other substances.

You only go out if there is weed involved.

You go to work but in the background, you are always looking for your evening or night with Mary Jane. Or you go to work after getting high. Or you manage to get high even in the middle of your work.

You clearly have come to the realization that weed is affecting all the possible domains of your life.( physical, mental, financial, spiritual, relationship with the loved ones/ the opposite sex, social skills, work and career, hobbies, passions, personality or character)

You have a feeling that you are living far below your true potential and calibre. ( Trust me, if you feel that, it's QUITE THE TRUTH!)

Your every day is kind of the same, like riding in a Ferris wheel.

You tend to think about sober life and all the better things you could be doing after getting high.

You have become tired of that specific, fleeting, only partially satisfying, very familiar type of high that only downregulates with time.

You mostly pass out in your bed after getting high and exhausted.

i have said the phrase ‘today I will quit’ so many times that now my friends simply laugh it off as a joke, it’s awful though because they don’t seem to understand the severity of my addiction, but how would they? i smoke alone, mainly cause I started to get paranoid about what people thought of me when they’d see me smoke. 

i don’t know what it is but for some reason weed has a hold of me, it controls everything I do, think and feel.
i have had a few stints at sobriety, all only lasting a couple days, i just can’t seem to picture my life without weed. 
i know that it’s ruining my life, im not social, I don’t enjoy being with friends anymore, I don’t enjoy my hobbies, I don’t like my job, I have zero self confidence, I can’t even eat unless I’m stoned.
so there’s all these negatives yet I still chose to buy weed everyday, and smoke it everyday. 

i have pictured my life without weed, getting a job I like, finding my perfect partner, having kids, watching them grow up. but there’s a shadow of darkness that hovers over that thought, it’s like something would always be missing from that way of life.

of course that one thing is weed, it’s always weed, im sick of it.

today is the day I try and sort out my life, I hope that in a few weeks time life will seem more clear, more enjoyable, I guess we will just have to see.

Day one was complete anxiety issues, day two was a little anxiety and a lot of crying and feeling weird, day three was crying non stop to family saying it’s withdrawals and how much I hated it and didn’t want to be here. Said idk what to do anymore I can’t keep feeling so off and bad. Went to doctor got meds but not taking them I want to do this without meds. The depression sucks so bad. I take melatonin this is day two of getting a nights worth of sleep. Waking up sweating but I’m resting. Is anyone else like super jittery? Like you can’t sit still?",9,0

I’ve had many streaks of no smoking (6mo-1year) in the last couple of years and even within those timeframes I never enjoy gaming again. Is it something I can bring back as an enjoyable hobby or do I just have to move on? 

A lot of my relapses were because I just wanted to enjoy a game again and sit down for an evening undisturbed, which of course ends up in months long daily smoking. Hopefully someone has some advice, if not no worries it was a form of ranting anyways.",36,0

Throughout the last 20 years, I've tried to give up. I tried councilling, accupuncture, going to holiday destinations where I couldn't get access to it, I learnt reiki, searched the internet for helpful videos, I got a pet...but nothing worked.


I have worked in good jobs throughout my life, but I began to realise that I was not reaching my full potential a few years ago and spending more and more money on pot each time I scored.


The drug got legalised in certain countries and states, which confused me and everyone around me said that it wasn't addictive or a hard drug. I also felt it helped me be creative, it helped me feel sane, so I continued.


Of course I shielded my habit from anyone associated with work, but this meant I could never form any proper relationships with people who didn't smoke. In fact over the last few years the only friends I've had, smoke it.


I also smoked to deal with issues like parents who neglected me, boyfriends who took advantage of me, loss of a baby, loss of loved ones who have passed.


The drug became my best friend, it comforted me when the chips were down, it became a go to for an instant feeling of love. My boyfriend even gave me money to get it (we are still together) as he said I was so much better on it.


But there was still something in my head, niggling away saying that it wasn't right. I had also started to take risks getting my hands on it and not knowing where the drug came or what it was being mixed with added to my worry.


Then lockdown happened, I couldn't get any, I knew this was a golden opportunity to give it up for good. 


I told my partner, he kept offering me chances to go get some, loaning me his car, offering me money to get some. But instead of caving in, I resisted, I frantically searched for help on the internet and by sheer luck, I found an app called 'quit weed' to help me.


The app has been fantastic, it has guided me, I've learnt about what to expect whilst giving up, rewarded me with visual notifications of what I've achieved including the money I've saved and the amount I've NOT smoked. 


Everyone is different, the quitting process affects every differently.

First came the sweats, then i lost my appetite, then came headaches, then emotion and now anger.


Today I'm on day 19 and I'm doing really well, but my partner has done nothing to help me or reassure me or congratulate me and I have no friends only acquaintances. Im feeling unsupported so I reached out to the apps emergency button which directed me to join this chat group.


Whilst I've read some great words from people on here (even today I saw a picture of someone eyes before and after their quit. which I can relate to as on day 17, my vision became clearer and I didnt need my glasses to read!!).


But my weakness is having no friends or supporting network. So I thought I'd leave a message on here with my story, in the hope that someone may read it and write a comment. Any comment. Just so I don't feel incredibly alone whilst I'm going through the quit process.


Thank you x",6,1

758,2020-04-14 06:58:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g13gg3/corona_is_killing_my_motivation/,Corona is killing my motivation,"Hi Reddit, my first post in this sub and my first Reddit post overall! 

As I am new, I thought I'd introduce myself.

I'll start with context. I'm at the end of my twenties, a student (long term...) and I've basically been smoking daily for about 7 years now. I started out as a teenager, but back then it was only on occasions. When I left my parents house and moved to another city, that's when I really started smoking.
I've never been the wake and bake type of person, obviously there have been exceptions, but mostly I toke up in the evening.

It's been a spiral. I guess that's a typical development. From hanging out smoking with friends, doing things together, to making time for myself so I could get high and watch series or do some other mind numbing activity. The joints got bigger gradually and increased in numbers. Id blow my brains out every evening just to fall asleep instantly and not have to feel a thing. The social isolation I thought I wanted to smoke got me depressed, and weed made me forget how I actually felt. I guess this sounds familiar! 

But, I didn't change despite realising this. I just kept on doing my thing, adjusting my life to suit my addiction. I always worked next to my studies and work gradually took over. Studies require discipline, work does too in a way, but once work is over I was free and told myself I deserved to smoke. I had done the bare minimum to keep my life going. It's worth mentioning that my work requires that I travel a lot, and as I work at schools, I mostly only did half days. Perfect! Book a nice hotel, work 8-12, and then I'd have the whole day to myself in a new place waiting to be explored and be drenched in the smell of weed, my weed. Obviously I was paranoid a lot, new places, very rural, I had to be careful, right?. That didn't stop me from smoking a j in the car while doing 140kph on the highway. Stupid huh? 

So, I was making money, had a life that looked functional from the outside, but on the inside I was slowly withering away. 
Hate me for this, but I'm quite good looking and women are attracted to me. Despite being a pothead I always managed to get to know good women who had their shit together and make a good first impression on them. But as soon as they started understanding how one dimensional I was, they left. It didn't bother me that much though, plenty of fish in the sea, and ganja would make the bad feelings of rejection go away, and honestly, I didn't care too much about any of them in the first place. Weed was the priority, not them. 

Up until January. I had spent a year with a girl, probably neglecting her more than I realized. I was still traveling, and still smoking every evening/afternoon. She wasn't perfect either. But the relationship ended, and in the end, I give myself most of the the blame. At first I didn't care, I just ramped up the smoking, forgot about it. 

In February I went to see my parents who live in a different country. That means cold turkey. I'd done it before, living there for up to 2 months staying clean. This time around, it just all caught up with me. All of the feelings weed had suppressed. The realisation, that I had actually loved this one girl, my social circles were shattered as all I did was travel and smoke, my studies were taking ages, and friends were starting serious jobs, moving on in life. And then there was me. Lonely, depressed, addicted and stuck. And no weed to make the feelings go away.

I came back to where I live and lit up despite being greatly unhappy, and I just got worse. I couldn't enjoy the high and I'd wake up with full blown panic attacks. So I made the decision to change. Start by smoking less and trying to get back into my social circles. That ended with partying, and something which was really dumb, too much and too strong mdma. 
The trip wasn't even that good, and the comedown completely broke me. 
I was paralyzed. I went to work but had to quit the lecture halfway through as I was a complete wreck. Imagine having a panic attack in front of 25 students, going to see your boss who always thought of you as quiet and stable, this time shaking and crying. He is a brilliant person though, sent me to a psychiatrist and gave me time off, promising me I wouldn't have to travel in the future.

That's when I quit weed.
And felt like shit. Still living alone, now having nothing to do. No goals, no visions and no weed. It was hell. I couldn't sleep, I was anxious and felt depressed like never before. 

It got better as the days passed. I called up friends from before who agreed to hang out, I started exercising and tried to invent a routine. And it worked. Therapy and some changes and I was feeling better. Slowly forgetting about my ex, slowly beating depression.

And then fucking Corona came. I couldn't do any of the things I was trying so hard to stick to, things that actually made me feel better. 

It all came crashing down again. The heartache, the disappointment and self loathing, the loneliness, the anxiety, it all came back. And so did weed. Since the lockdown went into effect about a month ago, I've been back at it,  smoking daily. Not as much as before, I try to moderate, but truth be told, it's still too much as 0 is what I actually want. It helps me cope, but I know it's only setting me back, I'll have to start all over again.

My hope at the moment is that I'll somehow find a way to keep myself distracted during the lockdown with other things, and keep weed to a minimum. Once this whole thing blows over, I'll give myself a better start. Move into a shared flat to alleviate the loneliness, start studying seriously again, work but not travel and exercise. 
Right now I can't find the motivation. I know there are online courses, I know I could apply for things, I know I should plan ahead, find some goals to stick to. Yet I spend most of my time feeling depressed and smoking come evening. Sometimes I go out, I have a motorcycle which is awesome, but the weather's bad, I can't use it. I went skating again, I try to play music, I read. But overall, I want to get on with life, not dabble in hobbies, I need development. 

Not sure what my point is or where I'm going with this, I felt I just needed to get it off my chest. I felt good when I stopped, but when everyday life stopped due to Corona, I started weed again. And I love and hate it. Hate myself for loving it might the right way to put it. 

Is there anyone out there feeling the same? And what are your thoughts? Am I only deluding myself and making excuses? Trying to justify my smoking at the moment? Or is this the one time when weed is okay? The first time it actually serves a purpose? I'm confused...

Thanks for reading, excuse any typos or weird sentences as English is my third language and thanks for any replies! 

Much love and good to meet you,

763,2020-04-14 02:50:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g10n91/day_5/,Day 5,"I’ve been smoking regularly (almost everyday) for the past 3 years. Im only 20. It started out as a way to have fun with my friends, the way it usually does. That progressed rapidly after an emotional teenage emotion filled breakup. Everyday I’d meet one of my best friends at the park to smoke out of an apple, listen to music and then drive home. 

Smoking weed started to become an excuse to go see my friends, and i started to neglect certain people who had amazing outlooks on life for the sole purpose of getting high. As weed started to become legal in Canada in late 2018 my parents became more lenient towards the idea. With the legalization to come it was easier to buy scentless alternatives like distillate pens and from that point on every night I would make excuses to go home early so I could get high in bed and watch YouTube videos. 

I almost failed my whole entire first year in University. I was driven towards the sciences and mathematics and always excelled at them. I understood the effects on a young brain but always neglected the idea. Now that I look at it, I’ve neglected a lot of proven science behind weed which is quite ironic because I’d always classify myself as a science guy. 

Growing up I was always a very emotional person and took pride in my emotions. They allowed me to be charismatic and make friends at an abnormal rate. My happiness has always come from making other people happy. Mid 2018 I started dating an amazing girl. She had every same interest as me, was easy going, trusted me, and treated me amazingly. We would smoke together but for her it was more casual, her personality is way less addictive than mine. As time went on, my dependancy on weed grew. As my dependancy grew, I became more emotionless but it wasn’t noticeable until now. As my dependancy grew, my feelings started to fade. Earlier this year we broke-up and it wasn’t your typical breakup. Things slowly fizzled out and now we’re friends. As I was losing feelings I didn’t even cry once, which is unheard of for 2017 me. 

I reflect today to see how many amazing qualities that I’ve lost in the process of weed addiction. I reflect to see who I was before I got trapped in this cycle. But the thing that’s crazy is these amazing qualities that I lost happened so slowly it was unnoticeable while in the cycle. I lost someone so important to me because of it. She doesn’t know that I feel this way, but I hope one day she can read this. It sounds like a copout to blame a failed relationship on my substance abuse, but its even more embarrassing for it to be true.

However right now I’m focused on growth. I know that if I focus on my regrets that this process will be harder for me. Right now I’ve had at least 2 panic attacks a day for the last 4 days. I’ve been depressed and extremely fuzzy as a result of withdrawal. What’s keeping me motivated is the person that I am excited to become, which is myself again. I’ve started working out, expressing my love for the people I have in my life, eating healthier, and setting goals for myself.

I plan to go forth with this, and abstain from weed for as far as the eye can see. I want to be a better person so I can sit and reflect at an old age of the impact that I had on this world. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading.",16,0

I want to be a physician assistant and the graduate schools and jobs test you randomly and at pre-employment. After i graduate this yr ill be taking a gap year to work as an EMT where ill be subjected to the same level of drug testing. I also struggle w anxiety and depression. I recently started seeing a therapist and he was the first person I ever told about my daily use outside of the people i smoke with. My gf of 1 year doesnt even know i smoke daily. My therapist instructed me to taper off in the following way: week 1: 6x a week, week 2: 5x a week, week 3 4x a week until I am done for good. Smoking has led me to countless close calls with the police, run ins with campus safety, a negative repuation, low grades, low energy and friendships based solely around smoking. I have failed 2 work related drug tests in the last 3 years and I hate myself for it. Despite these failures, I still have good job prospects, some good friends and an amazing gf that I dont want to dissapoint. Im sick of all those days where im spending my last dollar on weed, scraping my car floor/grinder for bits of weed, avoiding my family bc im high, showing up to everything high/late and prioritizing weed over things I know are more important. I hope quitting will help me get A’s in my last 5 college courses, get and keep the job I want, improve my self worth/repuation, become more active and not throw away the good things I still have going for me. It feels unfair that my chosen profession actively discriminates against marijuana users but maybe this is for the better. I am on week 3 of tapering off and I can’t wait to see what changes I’m able to make in my life. Seeing other peoples posts on here has shown me that theres a lot to gain from quitting and that anyone can do it. I’m gona start writing here and using an app to track my progress in order to hold myself accountable. I also plan to discard all my smoking equipment and possibly even some friends who will not respect my decision. This is my first real attempt to quit and I hope that it is as transformative of a decision as you all suggest it is. Thank you to everyone on this page who motivated me to start this process.",2,0

Thanks for having me. I stumbled upon this sub tonight after throwing out my bongs, pipes, grinder and papers.

I am 29 single male. This last birthday my perspective on life changed quite a bit in such a short time (commonly known as a Saturn return in the zodiac). When you realize your next birthday is your 30th, something shifted. As in, that is when you are REALLY an adult. My time on earth seemed more valuable all of the sudden. I have used weed since I was 16 only using heavier as time passed. I have always had anxiety and depression issues. Bullied. Bad relationship with parents and family growing up. Guess how I escaped?

The first time I actually got high it was amazing. It was so euphoric. Music was better. Food was better. Everything was better. Your problems got high just like you did. It was my filter through life. I went to college in Honolulu and guess what? Weed. Weed. Weed and some more weed after. It was my personality mixed with island culture. I was drunk and high my entire college era. I literally cannot recall one day without taking something. By the time I had graduated I was losing my grip on reality.

I have always managed to keep my life on track while I have been an addict of weed (By the way, do not have this problem with alcohol or any other substance). Went to work, cleaned my place, paid my bills, went to the gym. I was a complete ninja stoner. Since it is legal where I live. I will use any type of THC product to get high. I like smoking flower the best but I have a Vape Pen and Edibles to take when I have to smell nice and need clean eyes.

I recently suffered from a panic attack while driving. Usually I practice breathing exercises and am good at coming out of anxiety. But this recent panic attack was so severe, I was not able to breathe, and felt my arms going completely numb. I thought I was going to die and potentially crash. Ever since then, when I have smoked I have become incredibly anxious (using indica). I feel the demon of anxiety come to find me and torture me. For those of you who do not have it, it is so hard to explain. You feel like your body is being taken over by another force and you are not in control of it. I think I am tapped from weed.

My relationships over the years have failed due to several reasons, but pot was always in the mix. I am terrified of commitment, I never feel like I know ""who"" is the right one. Aren't your instincts supposed to tell you? Last year at 28 I went to a family friend's wedding single and WITH my parents. Decided I am never going to a wedding alone again.... Ha.

I have anxiety, depression, loneliness for a reason. The hole I fill with smoke every night. I rarely smoke with anyone but myself. I have attempted to quit before but always manage to find some good reason to start again.

There have been some incredible posts here that have been so inspiring and made me cry. I am not sure how I got so lost in this, and how much time has slipped away. But I am here to keep fighting through these tough times.

Tonight 4/13/20 was my last smoke. With CV19 going on, I was smoking so much. Falling behind with work. But I decided that I am going to come out of this a stronger, better version of myself. That uses this time of solitude for gain and not pain.

I was wondering if anyone has any anecdotal evidence of how their sleep has been effected by quitting cannabis?

Recent leavers, do you find it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep?

Long-term leavers, has your sleep improved and in what aspects? How long did it take you to adjust to a normal sleeping pattern again?

On a personal note, I’ve been using cannabis daily (smoking, edibles, dabs) for the better part of 13 years (ages 16-29). After stopping my intake, I’ve noticed that it’s harder to fall asleep and to get enough sleep at night, without needing a nap during the day. I know there will be a transitory phase while my body adjusts, but it’s unnerving anticipating the awful sleep that awaits me come bedtime. Also, the vivid dreams I have  been having might as well be nightmares, as I wake up in a cold sweat haunted by the weirdness I experience in them.

I really like how weed makes me feel and it helps with my appetite, anxiety, and insomnia. However because of how muddied and foggy it makes me feel, sometimes I feel like I should quit.

I have noticed an increase in my emotional instability in the past 6 months, but I am unsure if that is due to my mental state or because I am repressing my feelings when smoking weed. 

I feel like maybe quitting is a good place for me to start feeling better but I am scared of the process. Also ashamed at the fact that I will actually have to share with my family how I feel when none of them has dealt with addiction in the past. Also, another problem I am facing is if I do start to quit I would like to taper off (because of how emotional and irrational I can get when I am just going cold turkey), but I would have to re-up to do that and I am having mixed feelings. I talked to my bf about this and he asked: ""if you did, would you just use it as a re-up or an actual taper?"" I really want to taper off but I am scared that he will be right and I will just fall back into the trap of smoking excessively. I would also feel guilty if I re-upped. 

I am tired of being looked at by my family as a drug addict and would like to find relief in some way, I am just unsure how to start.",4,0

I was not an hard addicted (like smoking everyday at every hour, thankfully bc of my parents); i'm a 7 years user, but from February to October 2019 was a no-stop everyday, every night out. fortunately I've cutted off smoking in the morning and afternoons 3 years ago... 

 the only thing that I see as a difference is paranoia, it seems gone. still not have self-confidence, but I see some changes in take a choice all by myself without asking tips

the point is that I'm worried that when the quarantine ends (I'm italian so my quarantine started 1 month and 2 weeks ago) I return in the same bad habits, because of some friends who are really really really addicted. 

this is a circular post, I had to tell it to someone. my boyfriend is really addicted, so in this 25 days without smoking he's convincing himself to quit, and I'm saying that that's the right thing to do, so this words maybe couldn't  help him",1,2

Not a huge feat since I have done that several times over my smoking career of 15 years, but I’m going to celebrate none the less, because it’s harder when it’s an intention to quit, not take a T Break.

How I’m doing it...

I tapered down for two weeks and ate my last gummy over the weekend, it really felt like a goodbye to an old friend who simply grew toxic. I’ll miss things, but hopefully the end level toxicity reminds me why we don’t go back. I think knee jerk quitting has been the biggest barrier to succeeding for me, so I am trying this route instead. It was kind of nifty to get to say a long goodbye. I quit drinking over a year ago and have been looking forward to being totally sober since then but oh boy it’s a struggle. Weed is harder to quit than alcohol for me, it’s so ingrained in my habits, I imagine the same way a cigarette smoker struggles.

I didn’t succeed quitting alcohol for good until I met a 90 day goal. Those 90 days really changed my relationship with it for good...so while I’m taking this day by day, my goal is 90 days before I try to make any other decisions. I know I can’t promise forever, because that’s hella pressure and even thinking about that makes me want to give up, so 90 days. Doable, one day at a time.

This is the first community that has been real help and I’m so grateful to have found it. There is ample info on quitting alcohol, literature, support groups for every individual, but I really struggled finding realistic support for quitting weed. Everything spoke to a “stereotypical stoner” which doesn’t fit me, and I imagine doesn’t fit a lot of us. Advice like exercise, get a hobby, eat healthier, etc...I already take all of those things super seriously and am very successful and driven in my career and all of my relationships are blossoming. It was all too easy to justify that I can have it all and still smoke every day, all day. 

Grounded is a super app and resource too and I’m looking forward to growing my little acorn up into a full tree.

In those following three months I was more productive (in terms of personal growth) in those three months than I was the entire decade prior. Learning languages, earning new skills, waking up early because it’s not difficult (you get a longer day as well), working out before work, reading and relaxing time after work, plus the most understated benefit of all - capitalizing on your sleep gains which compound the learned ability of whatever skills you are practicing. Life becomes a ride of getting the results you’d hope yourself to be having. It’s a tremendously satisfying feeling. 

I’d argue that the majority of people in this sub may not have ever as a full grown adult - experienced the extended feeling where your reward system is skill and achievement based rather than centered around smoking a reward bowl. 

That described me perfectly up until pretty recently. Bad news is I went through a breakup and the coronavirus hit so now I’m back to smoking. It took an INCREDIBLY strong emotional stimulus to make the three month stoppage happen but holy shit did that change my view of marijuana usage. What you’re capable of doing without regularly using weed is worth EVERYTHING to you. The satisfaction of achieving at your utmost, unfiltered potential is literally blissful everywhere you look because it will be substantiated with the far reaching effects of hard work and discipline. The compounding you get from natural sleep makes your progress exponentially better as opposed to being linear when you smoke. 

Do you remember being a child and your parents being surprised at how fucking astoundingly fast you learned something or picked up something? It’s not because you were little, it’s because when you slept you hadn’t been drinking or smoking before bed and it altering your sleep patterns. You get that magic ability back very quickly but it takes an incredible will to abstain for periods long enough and frequent enough. [Why We Sleep: Matthew Walker]

Correct me if I’m wrong but our rational brain is located in the frontal lobes which is younger/newer than our emotional brain located I believe in the amygdala (the part of the brain that marijuana causes to be underdeveloped in adolescence who frequently engage in marijuana usage). The age is relevant because of how primitive each one is to the brain. The older it is the stronger everything related to it is in comparison to the other. The point I’m saying is you already know it’s bad for you and there for you should stop doing it, but you don’t because you don’t see the immediate negative result. That’s because you haven’t had a significant enough emotional catalyst to cause that specific reaction. Emotion is stronger than logic to your brain almost 100% of the time. 

I guess a good thing to do if you’re trying to quit is to visualize two doors. 

One door has a world pretty similar to the one your in now. No fancy upgrades, same old skills, good weed, perhaps you’re staying afloat I don’t know but you’re not excelling. For the work you put in you get 1+1=2.

The other door is a finely tuned world where for the work that you put in, 1+1=3. You’re able to do whatever you set your mind to for the most part. Things don’t bother you because you’ve learned how to cope with life in a healthy manner. You excel at whatever you put your mind to. No frequent weed use. 

For many of us here in my opinion, it’s your duty to choose the second door for as long and as often as we can. This is a logical appeal. For most emotional appeals it typically takes one’s life falling apart into chaos for the stronger to occur, it sure did with me. And now because I’ve chosen to smoke weed again I must subject myself to another emotional stimulus if I can’t reason it out. I think my experience with those three months gave me enough to make it. I hope sharing my story with you helps you with yours.

Good luck :) Time is the one thing that even Jeff Bezos can’t buy.",14,2

Anyways I am not going to give a “smokalog” cause it seems pointless. Since the quarantine my weed smoking has really had negative repercussions now I feel almost helpless or something. I have got to get ahold of myself and it must start with the weed. I’ve been in this insane cycle that winds up the same every time and I feel like I’m loosing my mind. Smoke, have a short reprieve, then it’s lethargic, eat shitty, binge excessively, feel guilty, keep smoking, get to bed late, wake up late, feel shameful, don’t work out, no drive, isolate. God I just can’t any more with this cycle,  but I’m scared I will just start again scraping resin or whatever like I have no willpower. I feel so defeated right now and the quarantine scares 
 me cause I feel like it’s just so easy to keep it up. Anyways, not sure if anyone relates but I need to pull it together. 
I am not a stranger to this recovery life I actually am a member of A.A. and have been alcohols free for 6.5 years. 3 years ago I started with weed again but just sparingly it was ok but recently and especially with this quarantine the ugly face of addiction won out and I feel like this place I’m in is all too familiar but it’s different this time cause the weed is destructive in less blaring but just as insidious ways. Ugh, it’s crazy how I can turn anything that can be enjoyable into this destructive addictive cycle. 

Does anyone relate to this? It definitely can be discouraging. 

Does anyone have any tricks that helped them in the first week to distract, or maybe readings to uplift. I know that ultimately it’s my spiritual condition that I have to rebuild but right now I feel like I’m in the hole deep if that makes any sense.

To start from the beginning, I used to smoke just for fun when I was younger, about 17. It started slowly with friends once a month, then twice, yet nothing seriously worrying.
I then finished highschool and began what we call here Cégep, which is between highschool and university. That's when it got more serious. After ending a problematic relationship and beginning to worry about my mental and physical health, I began to workout, and I tried as hard as I could not to smoke and to keep on getting stronger. Unfortunately, I was not ready yet to quit. I failed, quite miserably, and my addiction just got stronger, taking more and more space in my life. 

Fast forward to one year later (march 2019), after 3-4 months at my new job, I got a promotion, and I moved from Montreal to Ottawa on my own, rented a room and worked there full time. Seeing my girlfriend once every two weeks and being mostly alone, I started smoking more and more, from two times a week to two times a day. I was constantly in a haze, like time was frozen. And then life kept on coming at me: work, driving, seeing my family and girlfriend once in a while, then smoking, then working, smoking, smoking.. 
So I decided to stop! I lasted a couple of months without touching anything at all! I thought it was finally time for me to get rid of this addiction. How wrong was I.

One day came when my brother told me the company he works for was looking for new employees, at a better salary than what I was paid being in Ottawa. Quit the job, came back to Montreal at my father's house, started the new job. Life was good! Finally reunited with my girlfriend, family and friends for good, had a better job, health was getting better. And then I started smoking again, thinking ""one time won't hurt"". How wrong was I again! I immediately fell back into my old habits and started smoking again on a daily basis, juggling it with a pretty physical job and a heavy schedule, it took no time for me to let myself into the comfort of the haze. Tried to stop again, then back at it, you get the point.

Fast forward to today! Finally. I am deciding, as of today, april 13th, 8h12am, to stop and make a comittment to myself and my body. I started working out two weeks ago and I want to get serious with my training, I want to get better, stronger and mostly healthier. I abused my body and mind with toxic substances and toxic people and it is time I take better care of myself, not only to prove that I can, but also to inspire others who want to do it too. Everybody can do it, it might take more than one time, it will not be easy, it will not be fun, but it is what we need, it is what we deserve.

To everyone reading me, wether you have quit, want to quit, wonder if you should or are trying to, keep your head up and look forward to a brighter future without mind and body polluting substance. I have trust in all of you and myself, with the efforts put in the right place it is more than possible. Thank you and good luck to us.",3,0

Both began as an outlet to cope with anxiety but are now the causes of my anxiety. Whenever I quit one I instantly feel better and become more productive but I always end up relapsing hard after a max of 2 weeks. This relapse always leads to bingeing. I'm done trying to justify to myself that I can enjoy instant gratification in moderation. 

I was off to a good start in early March with sobriety but then the pandemic happened. Isolation has caused me to wake and bake daily. The weed paranoia has made my depression worse than it has been in years. I've been unmotivated in university and have not taking care of myself. The justification for my smoking was that I am smoking because I'm depressed and unmotivated instead of it being the cause of it. We all know that's bullshit. 

The reason I bring up porn is that porn use always causes a weed relapse and vise versa. This is probably because both are the same type of habit: a search for an instant release of pleasure that hinders you ability to achieve long term happiness.

After a really late night of bingeing both I felt like the biggest loser in the world. Enough is enough and it's time to make some long term changes.

Today is day 1 and was my most productive day in months. I cleaned my room and did my schoolwork on time. It felt more euphoric than any weed high. Just a reminder that instant gratification prevents long term satisfaction.",28,1

It’s taken a long time to be able to come here and I probably left out plenty and added stuff I didn’t need to but if anyone could take the time to read my story and provide advice or a just a different perspective I’d appreciate it so much. 

I’m a 19 year old guy and I’ve smoking for probably coming on 2 years now. It started off that I would smoke only when my brother had stuff cause he was my “guy” which was always in the evening every other day or every other weekend. Eventually I got my own med card and started to get my own stuff. I didn’t start really abusing it until a few months after getting my card. I don’t know if it’s directly related to the weed use but I went into a somewhat episode around October/November of 2019 and cut off every single one of my friends, ignored texts and calls when people noticed and asked how I was(I was convinced they all really didn’t care) and I even changed my number so people couldn’t contact me. I quit my very good paying job that I loved and worked hard to get and quit a play (I’m an actor) for no reason. All at the same time and then I just stayed inside and ate food smoked weed and watched Netflix and repeated that pattern for months never leaving the house. Flash forward wayyyy other shit in between here we are today. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, ocd and social anxiety before that episode (I think sometime in the late summer of 2019) and am on Zoloft. I’ve always been depressed but just recently was diagnosed and put on meds. I’ve been smoking the entire time on Zoloft and it’s safe to say I’m the same if not worse. I don’t like saying worse because the current feeling I feel is just emptiness and longing. Days aren’t bad or good they are just days. I’m just waiting to get to the next day. Like I’m waiting for something to happen. I’m waiting for me to change and suddenly not need to smoke. And I don’t even feel like I NEED it it’s just apart of my routine now. Food doesn’t even taste better on it anymore I’m nauseous either way a lot of the time but being high makes it better. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I just rewatch the same shows (family guy and the office) over and over again cause watching something else gives me anxiety. I wander around the house for hours sometimes cause nothing sounds fun or entertain for pleasureful. I don’t experience the joys of being high anymore and have entered what feels like this new reality. This disgust with the world and just realization that there’s not really a point. It’s not a suicidal feeling at all but just like what the fuck is life everything is fake and man mad and weird and just bleh. Just an empty numb and negative feeling constantly. I haven’t cried probably since when I first started my meds. If I have cried it’s been me thinking of sad things and forcing out tears but ultimately it’s just me making the cry noises I get maybe a single tear drop. I feel no emotion but when I do it’s not just one emotion it’s several and it’s intense. I’m just a shell. 

Every time I try to quit which is every time I smoke I think maybe it won’t solve anything. I think all the time that quitting marijuana is what will fix me that it is the reason I’m in this depressive hole and feel no joy. Of course, I have depression it isn’t gonna make all my problems go away but I think okay if I quit it then this fog will go away I switch back to being myself. But I think maybe I’m too far gone. This is my new normal. I need to accept this new look on life this new reality this numbness. I’ll never get to be how I was before. 

I haven’t felt like myself in every sense of the word in months. I forget what being alive feels like. I’m not trying to sound poetic that is just truly the best way to describe it. It’s not bad or good I’m just in purgatory. I’m on pause. I’m waiting. 

Is this the new normal? And how can I quit smoking this shit. It’s habitual now. I know it’s poisoning me and I know I’m abusing it but I can’t stop buying it and smoking it.


Please let me know if I left out anything you feel like would be helpful to know if I didn’t make sense at points. Thank you for reading if you made it this far :)",3,0

Reading a lot of posts here helped me come to the conclusion I needed to stop cold turkey after a constant year+ of being high. I have no way to get more since my plug isn't getting more due to the virus. So even if I want more I cannot get more. If this virus wasn't happening I would have gotten more. This has been a blessing in disguise for me.

It sucks. A lot. I won't lie. I know some people do not feel side effects from quitting, but I am. I do have my own mental health issues separate of this so I am not in the greatest of places, but there is an upside. I can FEEL emotion again. Even though alot of that emotion can be sadness or anxiety, I feel it rather then wanting to feel it and not being able to let it out. Being high numbed everything. I can let out that sadness rather than noticing it and not being able to do anything. I can feel that happiness when before it was subdued due to being high. 

If you're on the fence of doing it... just do it. Throw out that last bit you have. Crush that cart you have. Go full on and do it. Will it suck? Hell yes it will. However, after a week, I can feel it getting better and the effects of being sober feel much better than what I was before. I know I may have another week or two before I fully get over the immediate effects of withdrawal as my body gets used to no THC. I know it'll be worth it just from reading other people's stories here.

Other than this post I just lurk here... but I want to say I'm thankful for all the posts and comments here. You guys have helped a lot even if you don't know it, and I am sure there are others like me that won't post or comment who are also thankful. I wish whoever reads this luck on their journey :)",5,2

Getting to day 28 hasn't been easy, but worth it for a myriad a reasons, heres one:

I remember clearly how I started smoking for real, I was lonely, i felt alone, different and distanced from other teens my age (I was 14). I tried smoking some times in social situations and I found that it relaxed my anxiety, and widened my creativity. One being that the pleasure of listening to music was enhanced, so I started to smoke alone in my room, I would shut of the lights, only leaving a single candlelight, I would put on my favourite records, typically sitting on the floor, listening to music with closed eyes, feeling like I could taste every tone and melody on my lips, goospumps allover, everything else in the world around me would vanish.

Fastfortword: I dont know when it disappeared a long the line, but the interest in music, especially in this all succumbing way vanished, not only that, but it was replaced with other kinds of ""entertainment"" obsessive following of the last news, netflix, lots of podcasts - not necessarily bad ones, but not mind challenging either- I always noticed this lack of musical appreciation, just like my netflix, use and have pinpointed both of them as being depression red flags (all after their severity) 

I think my analysis was off, 28 days of weed Im absolutely still dealing with (a chronic) mental illness, and life is far from easy here in a country shut completely by covid and quarantine. But I realised, that I have been not only listing, not only enjoying but also connecting with music daily, this whole past week. In a way which I cant remember the last time I felt like that. Im just sitting with my earphones on, looking out the window, feeling and swallowing the music whole. Maybe it's dramatic, but in some way I feel I remember when I last felt like this, it was 19 years ago, when I was just 14 and looking for and an escape in the music, and weed enhanced that. Now Im reconnecting with this pleasure and escape, I didn't see it coming but by leaving wee i regained the magic of music.",39,2

I've quit a few times in my 13 years of daily use, but this time has made me realise how compulsive I am - every time I quit, a few days/weeks/months later I find life difficult for whatever reason and convince myself that I deserve a little weed. I tell myself that I can make it last for months but every time I end up using it as quickly as possible, getting as stoned as possible, hating it the entire time, yet as soon as it wears off I'm desperate for more and end up back in the cycle of daily use.

Well it needs to stop here. Those sober 2 months were so much better - I was clicking better with people and tasks, doing well at work, able to focus on my hobbies, sleeping regularly (after a couple of weeks), emotionally more in tune and less anxious. I know I'll be craving it a lot to start, and I'll need to be ready for those cravings to come back anytime, but I'll just rejoice when I get a craving because that means my body is free from weed and ready to start healing. Every time I ignore a craving my neural pathways will get reprogrammed. I found my last quit attempt easier than ever by focusing on social connection, self-compassion and self care so that will be my focus.

I am struggling with mental issues since a long time. Smoking since 12 years, wherein the last 6 years daily and a lot.

In 2018 I managed to quit for 6 months and then started again, believing I could manage to smoke 1 a day.. NOT

It's all or nothing, but all is not working. Even when it went better for a while due to skateboarding, it went downhill in the past weeks. (thanks corona, couldn't skate as much).

That is just a patch, not a solution, so now I am 7 days clean now and feeling good.

Due to the mental issues, my relationship is going down and it's a terrible time as we have a house together and are in lock down together.

I ordered some weed 9 days ago but decided to cancel the order. I was smoking too much, my mind was getting more f\*cked up. Enough is enough.

Fast forward to a few days ago, had a mental breakdown/anger tantrum and scared the shit out of my girlfriend (would never hurt her, but took it all out on my skateboard and myself.)

For her it's done now, she's sick of it. She helped me so much and wanted me to get professional help, which I kinda want too, but never stuck to it.

This was the last drop, she's over it now. 

I have a first appointment with a therapist online tomorrow and will plan as many as possible ahead.

It is probably too late to save my relationship, but I will fight for myself to get myself on a better level.

&#x200B;

Day 7 and I feel good for not smoking, but I feel so bad due to the rest.

Didn't have cravings to smoking, still don't have them. I hope I don't loose myself in weakness again and f\*ck shit up more.

&#x200B;

Want to stay clean, will try to save myself and my relationship. It's now or never.

If I go back to smoking, it will restart the endless spiral towards negativity and mental break downs. This has to stop!

I know that it's all in my head, and I could have done all this without smoking, but I know I don't have to. I feel that I am only quitting because or random testing at my job. It sucks because despite marijuana being medically available in my state, my job will not allow it regardless, and even legal recreational use won't be allowed in the future. My gf used to smoke, but rarely, and she quit, though she would like for me to stop she understands and has helped me limit my use. I want to quit in a way, just so I can move forward, unchained. I've always wondered what my true potential is, how much money I could have saved, and how much more I would have done, if I wasnt stoned alone in my dorm for all those years. I want to quit, I just feel like if I can continue to be successful and function normally, and I can afford it, why should I?

In a way, it’s almost like doing those things again for the first time, because the weed had me so out of touch with reality.

I smoked every day of my life from \~17 to 23, at the end I was smoking 5-8 blunts a day and stealing money from people to fund my weed habit. I was the guy who'd be in his pajamas at the convenience store at 6 am so I could smoke two blunts before work, a blunt on my lunch break, and then 4 blunts at night - this was when I wasn't jobless and living at my parent's house because of how broke I was.

Anyways, with the help of Marijuana Anonymous and this subreddit, I became sober at 23 for 90 days, relapsed on and off for about a year, then on January 23 of 2019 I became sober until today. 445 days total.

For those wondering: yes, sobriety from weed has an incredible effect on your life. I'm a writer, and I was able to regain my focus, my creativity, and my passion; I picked up additional hobbies like boxing, long-distance swimming and running, and cooking. There were some things that only came back after the 1-year mark - I've only recently been able to remember phone numbers right after hearing them and even 15-digit numbers again, an ability I haven't had since I was a kid. I've been free to pursue my interests and actually remember the things I read; most importantly I knew that my whole life was in my hands, not under the control of some herb, and that looking back I would know that whatever my successes and failures, they weren't because of weed.

Obviously a part of me still deeply craved and missed weed; I would always tell myself ""you can smoke again in 5,10, 15 years, just not today."" However, this quarantine has left me stuck in Brooklyn, New York, and I've recently begun showing coronavirus-like symptoms - while they receded today, and I think I'll be fine, I've had stronger cravings than ever to smoke weed. I would think things like ""if something bad happens, I just want to get high one more time...""

I have a friend who told me he'd give me bud if I wanted it. Part of me is deeply craving weed - it'd be nice to spend some of this quarantine holed up in my apartment, smoking bud like I used to - but I also get terrified at the patterns I might fall into again. I know, deep down, that smoking weed will only give me anxiety, make me lose focus, and jeopardize all the personal growth I've done in the past year.

Help! Any advice would be greatly appreciated...

I was a successful, yet apathetic stoner, mostly smoked at night alone or with my spouse, and then as legality increased the flow of good sh*t took over our lives.  I smoked all day every weekend.  The way I justified that I had this habit was I am professionally successful, and would cook my ass off while stoned.  Meal prep, try new recipes, etc.  Over a decade I put on 30-40 lbs. 

Anyway, finally decided I was tired of my house smelling like a head shop, bored of weed itself, wondered who I would be without it.  So i stopped.  From 1/2/20 to the last week of March. 

Enter quarantine. My husband bought some really good ish and we had been fighting. We smoked a bowl together.  Since then I haven’t stopped.  Every day again smoking.  I put on another 10 lbs, (munchies) asked myself why is work suddenly so overwhelming (I’ve always worked from home) Why do I find everything on TV boring again? Why do i Feel so lazy?  Why am I laying around forcing myself to take a shower? 

I know, DUH! Woke up today and decided that the nuances of quitting, and how great it was for me, didn’t FULLY appear until I relapsed. 

Jan and Feb were great months for me, I just didn’t quite realize it, or the fog I had been in until I went back into it.

Or I'd get treated extremely unfairly (like being wrongfully arrested) or have my intelligence berated but my mind just seizes up making it impossible to explain myself.

In dream time these episodes seem to last for hours even though it's probably just minutes in real life. Being trapped inside myself with my impotent rage and no way to let it out is incredibly exhausting. I should probably get that checked out...

So today would of marked 25 days sober ... unfortunately due to my slip up I ended up smoking 3 grams over the space of 2 days ... I’m not sure I can say that anymore - it’s more like day 2 ha ha

Like doing 21 days clean then having that ... would it put cannabis at high levels in my system again .... like for any type of drugs test etc ... 

Can’t seem to shake this slip off .... just goes to show that I’m really ready to stop 🛑.... 

Crazy how the same friends, environment can make you slip back into old ways ... even when you are feeling mentally strong.

Others like stig of the dump.

I feel the cravings most when gaming but I did smoke most during my gaming downtime and at night. I notice it less during physical activities weather that is a chore or not.

Everything is so fucking bright all the time.
I am partly irritable at times. 
I notice that general public are more like dicks than I previously thought. Likely because I was too high to care or too anxious to notice.

Seeing other people be successful and happy inspired me and I finally truly want to join you all and quit weed. FOR GOOD!

Background on me: 28F, smoking weed since 2016, daily/heavily since 2017 I think. Diagnosed with C-PTSD in 2019 from an event in 2015, so I imagine living with undealt with C-PTSD had its effects on me and I just never knew what it was.
Weed started to take over my life. I met other smokers, got more dealers, started doing things I wouldn't normally do. I lost friends, I lost my social life, I very nearly lost my marriage.
Tried to quit a few times lasting between 2-4 weeks.
Very recently a friend of 15 years told me she no longer wanted to continue our friendship because I'd changed so much since I became a daily smoker. This completely broke my heart and opened my eyes.

I do not want to be a mindless slave to this addiction any more. I want to be free. I want to have fun again, and enjoy the things I used to do before weed. Despite my C-PTSD and depression I know there is a better way of life to be found and that life does not include me making my life revolve around smoking. I deserve to live a happy and sober life.

It has been a shitshow  that I have only recently managed to recognize.  I had (both long and short) periods of dependence  with other (harder) substances but I could quit them all pretty easily. It has not been the same with weed.

I am in college. Used to be a straight-A student and a little workaholic in the making till I started partying pretty heavily 5 years ago.  Now, I can't manage to get a single thing done and I just don't know myself anymore. I don't get why I do the things I do, at all. It's hell. I feel like I've been slowly giving up on things (on everything, tbh)  without even realizing it. It has come to the point where I feel like there's not much I can keep doing my life. Lately, I've been thinking that suicide is the only thing left for me. Not that I *feel* specially sad or anyhting. I just can't see any option left for me.

Strangely, this has given me hope. Things have gotten so so so bad, that it has forced me to face myself, and now I know it isn't stress, it isn't my traumas, my relationship or family problems, or my political ideas that justify my dependence. I feel embarrassed by all the lies I've fed myself. Weed isn't helping with my problems but only making them worse.

I've been trying to quit for 5 months now. It's been 4 attempts, some have gone on for several weeks, but I always end up relapsing. Last time I ended up roaming the city from one end to the other just to get my hands on anyhting, during isolation (and I'm living with my parents atm, who are at high risk of  dying of this virus). So shitty.

This morning I finished what I bought that day. And I really want it to be my last. But... of course, I am afraid of what's coming. My previous attempts have been nightmarish and I feel like a coward. I don't wanna be. I wanna face this, and I wanna beat it. I think that's all I really need to regain some sense of self-esteem and self-control.

My psychiatrist has told me that I need to open up, let people in, and not expect to solve everything by myself. I feel truly grateful for finding this outlet. I could not have told half the things I have wrote to the people I know and I feel.... SO RELIEVED already.

I am proud to have grown out of the need to rely on weed to get me through the day, but in the back of my mind I can feel the urge to smoke and once it presents itself, it is very difficult to ignore. I just smoked the last of my weed this past Thursday. Yesterday was so hard. I felt lost, I felt like I wasn't going to be able to sleep or have fun. Today I woke up feeling a little better. This is probably my 4th or 5th attempt at quitting. Here I am on day 2 and while every part of me knows this is the right decision, there is that sliver of doubt that maybe if I can just smoke one more time I'll get the satisfaction I need.

I’ve just been feeling “restless”. Like I’ll find something to occupy my mind for a bit and then randomly a thought will creep in, “wouldn’t it be nice to get high and do this this or that”?

I know this is a lie and I don’t feel like I’m in any real danger of relapsing. I know moderation is a lie (for me at this point in my life, at least). Still...damn the thoughts are annoying.

I know this is sort of expected. I mean I spent a good 14 years smoking EVERY weekend, so now when it rolls around, it’s not really a surprise that I feel this emptiness.

I also quit alcohol around 2 years ago and while I’m no stranger to this challenge, weed has been a different one. Alcohol numbed me, but weed did make certain things more fun and now those things simply don’t seem as interesting to me. Legitimate activities, too. Prepping D&D, playing a video game, whatever.

I know that it takes time to essentially learn to live without weed, but I feel as though I’ve hit this weird rut where I’m far enough away from the vice grip of daily use that I don’t miss it...but I’m just bored out of my mind sometimes and feel restless, aimless, bored. 

Again, I figure all this is just to be expected. 3 months sober vs 12 years using weed and alcohol...14 years using weed. 

So I’m just curious...how long did it take you all? Did you feel anything similar to this? Am I just experiencing these amplified feelings during a world crisis? I do admit they weren’t as strong before all of this...

I’m just speaking generally and looking for some thoughts from others. I know everyone’s journey is different.

I still think about it everyday, sometimes even smell it out of nowhere. I finally came out to my friends and told them I have this problem and I felt too ashamed to admit it until now.
But I realised something truly important I want to share with you guys. And that is FEAR IS IRRELEVANT. I was living in constant fear of rejection, of the unknown. And weed made me comfortable, made me skip on chasing my dreams. There's even ridiculously fortunate that we are ALIVE. And considering how fast the world is changing, how short this life we have on Earth is, there is NO TIME TO WASTE. Go out right now and start doing what you always wanted to do but had doubts about. Spread the LOVE you had sleeping inside you for so long. The world needs it, you need it. And don't expect anything back, that's the beauty of it.

Thank goodness I found it though, and now is as good of a time as any. 

I’m 22. I began smoking heavily my sophomore year of college (2016 into 2017)—it of course started out as being a casual bowl here and there, but eventually escalated to me smoking anywhere from 1-5 blunts a day by myself. Since then, I’ve kept up with the same old nasty habit at nearly the same pace. 

There were periods during this time where I did have to quit for awhile to drop clean for a test, I ran out of money and couldn’t afford another 1/8, and the like. But I always managed to find myself back to smoking. 

I’m at a place in my life where I want to practice self actualization, but I’m starting to realize my constant numbing via smoking makes my judgment clouded and makes me feel dissociated with reality, really. I’m fairly confident I became dependent on weed as a result of trying to cope with stress of school and traumas in my personal life.

All my close friends and my brother (who is basically my best friend) are all huge stoners, so smoking is largely a social thing in my circle. But none of them seem to be swept up and preoccupied with getting high like I do, which makes me realize I have a problem. 

Smoking also has a comforting factor for me. In a weird way it makes me remember fondly times in my life I’m nostalgic for and it also helps with my easily onset nausea. But I think it’s time to start developing new memories without weed tied to them. 

I’m in a much better spot mentally and financially than I was a couple years ago, but I want to kick this addiction for good now. I have a great support system behind me with this community but also with my boyfriend, who doesn’t smoke. 

It’s going to be a very difficult personal challenge for me, as every time I tell myself I’m quitting, I end up going back on my word and end up buying and smoking again. I want this for myself, I want this for my future.

I am 19 year old male, and for the past 3 years I have been high in and out, though I'd say the last year or two was very frequent to daily use. Dabs and herb vapes. Anyways, I sold my shit 6 days ago because I felt like my brain and growth were being blunted by this crap. So i've been 6 days clean.

&#x200B;

I've been noticing strange symptoms, I looked up on reddit and while some of them I share I haven't seen my experience exactly and I wanted to know if this is normal:

**-Mild to medium headache** in the back of my head. It doesn't hurt but it's enough of a hindrance to where I thought i was growing a tumor.

**-Heavyness** in my belly, It doesn't hurt, its just... out. Like it's puffed out perpetually and I can't eat anything or drink anything, but at the same time not drinking fluids is bad so sometimes I force it down and I get nauseous and heavier in my belly

**-Chest tightness and difficulty breathing.** Of course, it gets better and goes away after an hour or two and it's gone by the morning, but it's still a concern of mine.

\-**General brain fog and tiredness**. I get tired much easier

&#x200B;

I should also mention, all these symptoms come together at night. I'll have general fogginess and tiredness throughout the day, but the headache, the heavyness, the chest and breathing, all happens at night.. which is usually the time I would always smoke weed (for years now, as I mentioned).

It may be obvious to a neutral perspective. But right now, internally, I am freaking the fuck out. I really hope all this is part of the weed and not a greater underlying issue.

The most frustrating thing to me is a severe lack of motivation. I don’t remember my motivation being affected this much in the past. Usually by day 2 or 3 I have ridiculous amounts of energy despite the other symptoms.

I exercise daily (cardio, weights, and/or yoga), eat healthy food, etc. but it doesn’t seem to be helping like it used to. I’m a 24-year old male if that makes any difference. 

I’m wondering if maybe anxiety around COVID-19 is the real culprit here, but I’m curious if anyone has any experience they can share. I doubted that now was a good time to quit due to quarantine, but I came to the conclusion that now is the best possible time to quit. When quarantine is over I’ll have gotten through the worst of it and can jump back into real life with a clear head. I also live with 4 stoners, and I want to learn to say no by trial through fire. Maybe not the best route for everyone, but my roommates are all long-time friends who totally respect my decision which makes it a lot easier.

As a side note, I’m a full-time musician who lives in Colorado... all signs point to stoner! So as a word of encouragement to anyone struggling, the best advice I can give is to find a positive reason to quit. I signed a record deal recently, so my positive reason was that I want to become the best artist I can be, unclouded by weed, to give myself the best possible shot at success. I find this way more effective than quitting due to the negative side effects of smoking.

So weed really helped with just generally passing out and not remembering my dreams. 

However, it’s beginning to ruin my life. I don’t want to admit it but I don’t think I came out of college because I was depressed, I think I was just too stoned to comprehend any form of responsibility and I hate myself for it. I’ve been suicidal for a long time, not so much an urgent feeling more a lack of care for my own existence e.g I wouldn’t mind if I died but I don’t intend to go out of my way to do it. I used weed as an escape from my mental health problems and past trauma but now it’s just becoming a case of it’s there so I’m going to smoke it and now my life revolves around waiting for the next bag of smoke.

I've been a pretty heavy consumer of marijuana for the past 3 years, and I've developed a dependency on it for happiness. Smoking weed would be the thing I looked forward to the most every day, and without it, almost everything seemed mundane. I lived alone for the past 2-3 years and weed had been my closest friend during that time.

I confided my feelings with my SO, and she told me that I needed to quit, and that she would also quit with me. So I finally gave it a go.

The next two days: utter hell + shit storm. I had always struggled a bit with anxiety, and without smoking weed, I felt that the anxiety that had always remained below the surface was able to break free and wreak havoc on my mentality. Also, I felt extremely nauseous at night specifically, puked bile twice each day, and had to lay in bed often because my head was spinning. I had cold sweats all day; I had to turn the heater on and off 10+ times each day because I would be dripping sweat one minute, and would be shivering in my blankets the next. Also, no appetite whatsoever. This has probably been the first time in my 22 years of life that I've felt like puking after eating one apple slice.

I'm stuck at home everyday and I feel like I have noone to talk to. I live in LA, so it's heavily discouraged for people to go out and about. Loneliness without weed is consuming me and I have no idea what to do. I really don't want to resort to smoking again as I would never want to go through withdrawal again.

We all have addictive personalities, so we’ve got to accept it and channel that trait towards get addicted to good things. Otherwise, if you’re anything like me, you’ll spend your whole time craving it because it hasn’t actually been replaced.

I have rule , I never smoke at work so on weekdays just at night (1-2 J) and at weekend (2-3 J) . 

So I quitted it 15 days back ( because of lockdown ) and the only withdrawal I felt was just a mild insomnia ( corrected with excersise ) and just feeling bit bored ! And after a week I actually felt better than smoking up like better attention and  taste of food , more social  good mood ,etc

The people who can take or leave marijuana and other drugs when they want, the recreational users, the people who aren't or never were addicts because they always had self-discipline and self-actualization. The people who can get the best of both worlds, the strongest high from a drug, but know how to self-restrain themselves to prevent their lives from falling apart.

I was high pretty much 24/7 for 5 years, from when I was 19 years old. I quit the daily habit in January 2017, with a few minor relapses since. 

This sub is great, and I really love the support here. I wanted to add some personal advice, it may work for you, it may not. If you're struggling I'd encourage you to read ahead. 

Here's the gist of why I managed to quit: it was a fucking *long* process. Quitting for me wasn't a case of just deciding one day to go cold turkey. That flat out did not work for me. Like many of you here, I wanted to quit for a seriously long time before I actually did. I hated myself for ages even though I kept reaching for the green. ""I'll do it tomorrow, I'll finish this bag first, I'll do it after the party on the weekend."" Like having to break up with someone, there was simply never going to be a good time to do it. 

It took a six week trip to Europe for me to hit the reset button, cause I was too chicken shit to buy drugs in a foreign country (except Amsterdam). The sobriety I had was... liberating. Life was so much clearer. It helped that I was on holidays, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to do what I did if you're at home. 

My point is, it's not like everything just changed for me when I quit. I still had my old habits. My addict brain still had cravings (still does, to this very day). And I slipped, more times than I can count. But you know what? Quitting is like any other habit: it gets easier the more you do it. Maybe counting the days works for you, and if it does, I don't want to take that away. But so many of you on this sub seem to obsess on day counting. My advice? Just one day at a time. That's your focus right now. Day 4, day 15, day 57, doesn't matter. What matters is that you're sober today. 

If you slip, you slip. Don't use this as an excuse to smoke tonight. But similarly, don't use it to beat the living piss out of yourself if you relapse either, because I can guarantee you that hating on yourself is the surest and fastest way to impeding your progress. 

TL;DR, quitting ain't a light-switch. It's a muscle. Try hard and try often, and persist in your goal. You'll get there eventually.",306,0

now I'm wondering...

Is it the psychological addiction people are having that makes it bad? What does it feel like to you?

Is it that people get lazy or tired? Are there people where they felt super motivated or normal after they stopped?

What happens to you physically and mentally after you're done smoking for a few days? A few weeks? Can someone compare the before and after possibly?

I hope that these questions don't come off as disrespectful to people's ideals. I'm just trying to figure it all out and am considering stopping if it makes me better.

I was so deluded thinking that weed was solving all of my problems. After countless relapses, I realized that it was so pointless to continue, and all of my problems stemmed from getting high. The only way you’re going to quit weed is to feel so sick of smoking and living a half life, that withdrawal doesn’t even matter. I smoked multiple times a day every day for years.

I don't know where to start, but I'll start by saying that a fell in love. In love with the wrong person. I was 19 and I totally fell for this guy. I had never been in love before so it hit way harder. The whole relationship was based on lies from him. Which made me super anxious and I developed generalised anxiety disorder. He used to tell me that university was creating all this anxiety. He used to take trips and invite his ex to visit secretly. Of course I knew all this shit was happening. But young, dumb & blind. 

Arguing, crying, panic attacks, screaming, hospital trips and in the end I started hurting myself so bad. Only to get over it in the morning with a few roses he got delivered. Meanwhile, I was studying my Masters at university and it was so difficult with him in the picture. I failed my 2nd semester because of the drama.  I stayed as he continued to manipulate and hurt me in so many ways. According to my therapist, it was all codependency. 

The first time I ever smoked weed it took me over 1 month to find someone that will sell it to me. It's illegal where I'm from. 
I went through an emotionally draining 2 year relationship when I was 19. I was super attached to him and after 2 years of lying and cheating I  just couldn't leave him. I was that girl who people wondered what someone like me was doing with him.. I don't know what I was holding on to- a 30 year old guy with  no job, no money, no career prospects. By the end, I was paying his rent, food, clothes and basically supporting his whole family. On my 21st birthday, we were at dinner and I saw text messages from his ex-wife (which I had no idea he had one until he confessed 8 months in), I flipped it. I cried in the middle of the city and he took off. It was the worst 21st birthday. Before weed, I had never tried anything (cigarettes, alcohol, pills). But I was in a such a dark place. He was my addiction. And I hated it. I hated how dependent I had become.I didn't know what to do but I knew I had to find some way to get away from him. I had my first J (didn't tell him) and after one puff I was totally high. I kept smoking and having Epiphanies about my relationship. I told myself that I would break up with my bf finally. I did this by ignoring him for days, (he didn't really care, I had threatened to leave so many times that it just became nothing to him. I was hurting so bad. But the weed made it so much easier to leave. One day, I called him upset that I had ignored him for 2 days and it didn't bother him. Apparently he thought I needed the space. I don't know what I was holding on to- I continued ignoring and smoking. During our relationship I had given him soooooo much. My PlayStation 4, bought him brand new iPhone XS MAX, laptop, shoes, HomePod, even bloody WIFI. It was like I was sponsoring this guy. I don't blame him for manipulating me to hold on to him. He was living the dream. One day I snapped, finished work, drove straight to his house, went into his room and took back everything I gave him. Broke my sim. Cut my hair. And never looked back. That day I took My PlayStation, phone and the speaker and I stormed out. Ever since that day I've been smoking weed. I remember my heart was beating so fast, I had never did anything like this. 

I went from therapist to doctor to phycologist telling me I had a problem with anxiety and stress - that I needed to be on antidepressants. I'd take the prescription and use it to roll my weed on. I left him at 21, I'm 23 now and graduated with a bachelor and masters degree. We've been broken up fo day a year and a half. All of which I smiled so much weed. Yesterday I decided to quit after around 1.5-2 years of smoking and wow, the memory of him came back so much. But, but, it was bad memories.i don't regret anything. I was able to smoke weed and graduate with a credit GPA and now that uni is over and he is gone, I'm left with myself.  I'm only a day into quiting weed and It feels good. Last night I had the wildest dreams of me smoking weed.  
I don't think I will ever go back to him or any bad relationship. Weed taught me to be strong and although I formed a new habit- I was able to get away from him and have been single ever since. The single life+ + a masters degree+ quarantine , really calls for 10 JAYS A day. But for some reason, I stopped. The honeymoon phase with weed was over. I was just numbing the pain.

Nothing in my life makes me feel genuinely happy and every single thing is a challenge. I'm nervous about my future in every way, but I'm still so dedicated to succeeding that I don't give up. Which is a good thing but feeling like I have to succeed does make my life full of anxiety. I'm afraid of fucking up my life like my dad did, who is a drug addict and alcoholic.

The other day I found myself looking all over the house for my old prescription anxiety pills (Xanax, which I didn't know at the time). I didn't find them but I did find some spare oxycodone pills that were prescribed to my mom a few years ago.

Opioids were what ruined my dad's life and I promised myself I would never take them even if I broke my back. Yet there I was staring at that bottle a good twenty seconds. I didn't take them, thankfully, but coming that close made me really come to terms with how serious my issues are.

This is my first time posting on here but I have had my eyes on this subreddit for awhile, right now I can officially say I'm past my first 48 hours sober after excessive daily smoking for the past 3+ years. I am shocked because I keep having those ""I really wish I was high right now"" moments but no crazy withdrawls. Due to the quarantine my sleep schedule has not been the greatest so I don't notice much difference there other than actually falling asleep is kinda a struggle. Currently not eating as much but hopefully that'll get better. Its also tough cause weed used to pass the time, and now I find myself with an excessive amount of free time (which I don't know how to spend so any ideas would be appreciated). I'm hoping I can get back into a normal routine and sleep properly and at normal times, eat healthy and sober, and maybe pick up some new hobbies.

So I've not been stoned 24 hours a day, but for the last two years I've smoke to some degree pretty much everyday. Going off of some advice someone on this sub gave me, I began to try to understand WHY I felt the need to smoke, by exploring my thoughts and feelings via stream of consciousness writing.

My dudes, It's been crazzzyyy effective for me. I decided I would write at least one entry a day. It doesn't matter how long the entry is - could be several pages or just a couple sentences. Grammar doesn't matter, structure doesn't matter, topic doesn't matter - nothing matters except that you write honestly and like no one but you will read it. I also play some chill Lo-fi music while doing it, and that chills me out almost as much as weed. lol

The first couple times I did it stoned because (a) I was unable to resist my urge and (b) I thought it would actually help. Very quickly I felt a reduction in my desire to smoke, and I only just realized right now that it's been 3 days today! I feel like I'm recovering my old health balance with weed, where weed is a fun little plant, not a daily companion that filled me with guilt.

Anyway, I'll get off my soap box. I just wanted to share this with you because it's helped me so much. Thanks to everyone's support and positivity on here. :)",3,0

Basically, I'm a college student who got into the habit of smoking weed during this most recent winter break, around December. Since then, I've been smoking on a near-daily basis, polishing off several joints and killing an entire STIIIZY pod in roughly a month. When I flew home due to the coronavirus, I only had a few pre-rolls left, which I finished pretty quickly. I've now been off of weed for about 2 weeks, and for the past 4 days, I've had random (and pretty crippling) anxiety. I feel like I have nothing else to be anxious about in life, and I have never had anxiety problems before. Is this because I stopped smoking? And how long might it last?

Quick story: basically in quarantine I smoked out of a bong 15-20 times a day, usually 4 bowls per session, for about 2- 2 1/2 weeks straight. As you could imagine for the first time ever I really felt the effects of smoking in my chest/throat. 

I also began noticing a white covering on the back of my tongue, which totally freaked me the fuck out thinking it’s cancer. 

I kept myself to 2-3 bowls a day, but today I am trying to go totally sober as my throat feels better, tongue doesn’t look much better, and my anxiety is very high. 

In general, I have very severe anxiety disorder, am prescribed Xanax, and it does nothing but make me even more depressed.

So, what do I do? What did you do to get over your sobriety? I can’t stand being sober. I’m a naturally someone who hates being sober so weed has always been great for me because then I don’t abuse alcohol, which I hate the after effects of.

Please truly, I need help. I’m severely depressed here and struggling. Thanks in advance for any help, PM’s are open.",2,1

For 5 years i've been meaning to quit weed. Tried and failed multiple times. No sweat.. 5 weeks and 3 days ago I made the leap. First 2 weeks were rough, but now my body is getting quite used to not smoking minus the occasional urges here and there. Routine is looking great: working out, doing side projects, researching, walking and reading a lot. Feels good, man.

Here's the catch: some of my greatest ideas that I built upon came when I was high af. These weren't necessarily ideas that sounded great when I was high then sound meh when I was sober. No. The ideas I come up with high were great, so great that I'm still working on a project to this day that sparked when I was high. I come up with creative problem solving when I'm high (with code, both front-end and back-end). My juiciest ideas came when I got high. There were a lot of consequences with smoking though,  and the cons outweighed the idea benefits, so I decided to take a leap to the sober side for obvious reasons. 

Now, although my discipline is on point and my work ethic is stronger, my ideas ... my ideas are gone. I need another source to inspire myself. An ""Aha"" moment came to my dream the other day, but those are rare. Any idea I do come up with, I'm not as motivated to follow through. I know those ideas were always within me and weed kinda brought them to light, but now that they're hidden away I don't know how else to uncover them, naturally.

I’ve wanted to quit for at least the last 5-6 years, and I’ve tried at least a dozen times but never even made it a day. I have agonized over wanting to quit so many nights. 

This time I knew I HAD to quit because a couple things I’ve been really excited for got cancelled because of the coronavirus, including a trip I’ve been planning over a year. Quitting smoking has been the number one goal of mine for years, and finally making it this long has been a very helpful consolation to the disappointment of my trip being cancelled. 

Of course the nightmares and anxiety are a major pain in the ass, but already I feel like I have so much more energy and focus, like I can be the person I wanted to be but was too stoned or foggy to actually become. 

I hope I can keep it up, at this point the temptation seems to be weakening as I build a longer streak. I have a quarter just sitting by my bong I haven’t even touched, which makes me feel good.

I’ve been a weed smoker for 8 years, smoking nearly everyday, multiple times a day for the last 6 years. I’ve been “considering” (in the most passive sense of the word) quitting for 2 years, and seriously considering it for about 3 months now. I’ve told only a few of my friends, who seem to be preoccupied with asking me why. I can’t say I know why, except that I feel it in my gut that this is the right thing for me, and I don’t want to interrogate that too hard. More important to me, is that I’m choosing discomfort, and that I want to begin confronting the reasons I’ve procrastinated for so long. I want to share this and see if anyone relates to these, and how you’ve navigated them. Advice, stories, suggestions, etc are more than welcome.

In no particular order:
1. I’m still wrapping my head around the idea that everything, food, tv, laughs, etc are already so good when I’m high. So to think that they could be just as good when I’m sober doesn’t seem believable. 

2. I’ve been slowing the frequency, but haven’t been writing it down to actually see if the average has actually gone down or not.

This is a particular reason I believe cold turkey is the route for me.

3. It’s absolutely something that curbs my general anxiety and PTSD. I underwent therapy for these things for approximately 2.5 years and learned a number of coping mechanisms. However, I never stopped smoking throughout, against the formal recommendation from my therapist. I’m nervous for what these coping mechanisms and my triggers “look like” with a sober mind.

I’ve been out of therapy for like, at least 3 years. Haven’t felt the need to go back for the things I originally started attending for. Not sure if this is an important detail or not, but here it is.

4. I immediately have something to relate to new people with. New people who I usually meet through my weed smoking friends. All my extra money has gone to weed, as opposed to hobbies, travel, or anything else that would lend itself to forming a personality or making someone interesting for other reasons.

5. The need to unlearn the preconceived notion I have that makes me think that the people I surround myself with won’t be of any help because they haven’t experienced this themselves. Whether it’s quitting cold turkey, navigating the world with PTSD and anxiety, etc. I use this to discredit any help or support they might have to offer.

The person I want to be knows that nobody I ever meet will have walked the same path I have, so that tells me that I need to dig deeper and provide that for myself, and allow my loved ones to help in the ways they can... before I write off any help at all. I don’t know how. 

So there it is. I’m glad I found this place, and I look forward to helping you all as much as you can help me. Anything we have in common? Have any of you walked any of the paths I have? Any other advice, stories, etc? Thank you for your time and support.

Here’s to Day 1, and choosing discomfort.

Recently I have also had a big break through in my life in therapy and I've been on a path of change because frankly the way I live my life and the way I treat myself makes me absolutely miserable. I have the power to change that and I've been on new meds and over the past month I've had about four drinks of alcohol and those were spaced out between weekends. Much better than what I used to do which was 8 to 14 drinks in a single night every weekend. That change shows me that I can quit weed for once and for all.

I have quit it totally around four or five times in the past and thrown everything out just to end up smoking again, guys I want to be done for good. Im tired of feeling tired. Im tired of my brain telling me to die. Im tired of trying to find peace and happiness in drugs and booze.

A textbook spring's afternoon; I await for the coming bloom in great anticipation. Times are particularly trying. Covid-19 has brought society to our knees as we separate ourselves from one another. A vital step for the long-term recovery without question, but in the short-term, it is testing. I've been particularly wrought with guilt for quite some time now. Feeling my life has been at a complete standstill for the past several years, it's all come crashing down on me now when I've become forced alone.

I don't often feel good about myself after smoking the Devil's grass anymore. It's my coping mechanism for my life writhe with depression and anxiety. It wasn't always like that. At one point, I was a confident man, albeit strange. But now, I'm a former shell of myself. Pathetic. THC has taken away my motivation to proceed forward with reckless abandon. Who am I kidding? It's taken my motivation to even put a small foot forward. Focus remains a moving target I cannot hit for long periods of time. However, when I occasionally hit my mark, a wave of euphoria hits as I absorb the knowledge. 

I called my dealer yesterday to have a 1/2 delivered to me. I lament the amount of money I've wasted over the years. I've flushed weed down the toilet before, proudly declaring that this would be the day my debilitating addiction would come to an end. I've done so again today, most of the 1/2 down the toilet as guilt came crashing down earlier this morning. 

I used to have a lot of hope in my soul. I've trained to accomplish goals and succeeded. I haven't the faintest inkling the point in my life where all confidence came flooding out. I've only been able to stay sober for brief periods before, the longest being about 4 months. My sense of taste has also slightly deteriorated. Yet, in the back of my mind, there's a morsel of positivity. Life isn't bad at all. There is so much beauty in this world, much I've been blessed to see with my own two eyes. The first concrete step towards my sobriety will be having to change my outlook on this truly, truly beautiful life. 

For those who are in a position of wanting to rid ourselves of this burden, I'm with you. I will not be easy, at all. I'm hoping to use writing as an escape and all of you are the unfortunate chosen subjects. Regardless of whether my particular story of hundreds has any supporters, it feels good to have something down in writing, even if it is anonymous. 

I'll just be real here. I'm too cheap to want to pay for a therapist and ya'll are just happen to be in the crossfire as I satiate my desire for attention.

You sit day in and day out, wasting money you don't have, and health you can't afford to lose, because you’d rather sit in and refresh /r/politics and smoke buckets of joints. You avoid appointments with friends because you can’t smoke freely. You avoid events because you are not comfortable with new people, cannot formulate your thoughts enough to make a good impression. You can't argue your point of view (remember how much you loved it? Do you remember all your friends looking up to you because of that?) You can't think be fast enough to be funny, every attempt just fails and kills your self esteem even more. Dude, you used to be witty as fuck. 

You found excuses for [girlfriend] so you could go home and smoke joints, instead of hanging with the one who loves you more than anything, and whose company you actually enjoy. Joints and jerking off, over some of the best sex of your life. You looked at time with her as more of a duty and were relieved if it got postponed. She is now the only one in your life who actually cares about you, who strangely enough still respects you, much less looks up to you, and who you are comfortable around… And you fail her. You mislead her and lie. This is your friend???? How dare you call her that. You’d fantasise of kneecapping anyone who would treat her with that kind of disrespect. She's amazing and you don't deserve her. Her heart is bigger than your void.

You fail [child]. Look at her, she's the most beautiful and the coolest kid in the world, and she's already lost a father. You've already lost her, and the most special time of her life. Are you going to fuck with what little you have left there? You promised [ex] not to smoke the days you had [child], how long did it take before you broke that promise? How much planning and effort went into being able to take her to a place that was safe to smoke? You found excuses to leave early, to smoke, and lit up the second you were out the door. FUCK YOU, you're no better than [friends], when you don't care about [child], how can you expect them to? 

You say you care, but your actions say otherwise. Imagine if you were busted, you would have lost all parental rights. What if something had happened to your child!!? You know very well the shame and grief would have killed you. She was the only thing that stopped you from suicidal thoughts when you were at your lowest, without her and with that shame, there would be nothing left to stop you from jumping off a bridge. You haven’t had the balls to admit this to yourself, but you were actually glad they went on vacation, so you could be off the hook and have free reins of smoking in peace. FUCK YOU!!! [Ex] hasn’t slept since she got pregnant, she has a hundred health problems and multitasks a serious career, a dog, a baby, and yet she fixes everything like a boss. You can't even eat breakfast, and justify it cause you’re sad. Boo fucking hoo. Yet you don’t want to see a psychologist because then you’d have to admit that you are fooling yourself and have no one else to blame. You were offered a free one during working hours even, but you are too lazy, stupid, selfish and proud to accept. You do not see that your problem affects everyone who has the dubious honor of knowing you. You think you care about the world and injustice, but you don't even care about the few who still give a shit about you.

[Ex] nailed it. She said you were ashamed that you hadn't amounted to anything, and she's absolutely right. You had all the potential, you are smart, creative, fun, knowledgeable and driven when you care. You should have become an inventor, artist, musician, entrepreneur, writer. Every teacher has praised your imagination and creativity, yet you used it as a crutch or to take the path of least resistance. With [ex] on the team, the two of you could have taken over the world. [child] would grow up to change the world. She still can, but you don't get the fucking credit for it. Why should you, you barely get to see her. What price does she have to pay for your sins? By the time you find out, it's already too late and you don't ever deserve forgiveness for that.

You don't even get a proper high anymore. You get nothing of what you used to like, only stressed out and full of anxiety, you get to be a loser with bad social life, your hobbies decay (you were good at guitar once), shit hygiene, mess everywhere you can't be assed to clean, lung cancer on the way unless corona takes you first. Remember when you were sick and felt you were breathing through a straw, yet you forced yourself to smoke joints. YUCK!!! Zero energy, poor sleep, and god knows how much it affects the rest. You eat like shit and are way too skinny, imagine not having to be ashamed of taking your shirt off on the beach. You can't, because it never has, and never will happen, as long as you smoke. You've spent hundreds if not thousands on hobbies that you touch twice and then allow to rust away.

You remember nothing, what else will you have except memories, one day? You fail those around you by forgetting to call, not remembering birthdays or appointments. You fail yourself because you have no control over your life, and just wait for the next bad news, the next debt collector, whatever. You can't focus, you can't remember a number for 10 seconds. You said the wrong address after living there for a year. There are a hundred other examples, but you don't even remember them.

You spend all day learning cool things, at least that's what you tell yourself, but it disappears just as quickly. You don’t retain it, can’t use it in any productive way. But you know there is hope! Everything came back after a month without weed that time. It's there, but you've lost the key. 

All that time you waste in front of reddit, netflix and gaming. You care more about reddit comments than talking to friends, you don't have patience enough for a new series so just watch the old ones over and over again, and even games you know, you suck at cause you got zero reflexes and cant remember mechanics more complex than Rocket League. New games you can just forget about, you are too stupid to get into it. You had been looking forward to RDR2 for 10 years and you played it maybe an hour? Two? Sex is worse, how many times have you had to stop it and find excuses cause you couldn’t perform? When you were sober you’d have sex 3-5 times daily, now you have to no-fap the day before to even be able to come.

You like psychedelics. You preach about it as profound and life-changing, but refuse to listen to what they tell you. You took LSD and wept for hours, and it told you what you needed to hear, that you’re burning the light on both ends. Direct quote. You thought about [child], and how she will view her father, what her mother will say about you when that time comes. Either nothing or lies, [ex] can't brag about you because she has no reason to. You realized all of this and were ready to stop. It lasted until the next day, before you went back hard. Smoked before work. Snuck out during lunch and smoked in front of a school. Rolled joints on the toilet. IMAGINE if it was discovered ??! You’d have to move from everything you know in pure shame.  You seek advice but ignore anything that doesn't fit your distorted narrative. 

Do you remember when you got up daily to smoke before [former work], everything you did to avoid being found out by [ex]? The time you went and smoked before taking the bus, and two minutes later she came, because she had been to the store. You were so relieved she didn't catch you, but it wasn't enough to change anything except being more cautious, sneaky and deceiving. Had she caught you, had you not been so damn proud and stubborn, you might have realized the problem, and maybe you would still be together. The two of you had your problems, but how many of those came from joints in the first place? More than you dare to admit to yourself.

You've gone through a lot of, buddy. It is understandable that you have struggled. You've had shitty friends who didn't support you in the toughest year of your life, never showed interest in [child], didn't want to see pictures, joked about child support... You lost your social life, your house, your dog, your best friend, your partner in crime, your greatest love, your job, your finances, your car, everything you've built up over 5 years. It wasn’t just your fault, but it probably could have been fixed if you didn't smoke. [Ex] did the only right thing by ending it, so you couldn’t drag her and [child] down to your level. You respect that more than anything, it’s what a good parent does. Even if you wanted it to end, you wouldn't have had the balls to pull the trigger, cause you just take the easy route and fear any change. BUT YOU DO HAVE BALLS, or at least used to! You were fucking tough once. Never not afraid, but you faced it and used it as an ally. Fought for your opinions, what you thought was right, no matter who or where. Because you knew you had enough bravado for it. What happened? Weed. If you find other excuses, it is an indirect result of weed.

Your parents are getting older, you don't know how much longer they will be around. And they have fucking been there for you. You spoiled little brat. They have sponsored your apartment, your car, child support, they just need a scent of you struggling, and they’ll write you a check. And you can't even pick up the phone when they call, you get annoyed when they ask about things you've already told them. They just want to hear your voice. They just want to know you're fine. Your breakup and them losing their only grandchild has hurt them more than you’ll ever know. Your mother is obviously in early dementia or worse. Your father is aware of this and has no one to rely on. Does he whine? Does he give up and get high daily for that reason? No, he does what it takes for those he cares about, like a man. Like a proper human. Suddenly one day it's too late and you will never forgive yourself for having failed them when they needed you. You were close to your brother once, now months go by without talking. You will find reasons not to visit them. When the whole world turns your back on you, he’s the one who will be there. You ungrateful fool.

But it is possible to fix yourself again. You are the most stubborn bastard you know, you just channel it the wrong way. All it takes is NOT to roll that joint. Get proper sleep, eat better, drink water, eat your vitamins. Elementary school shit. What you tell [child] she should do. You'd be so disappointed and even furious if she walked in your footsteps, you hypocrite. People have serious problems and come out stronger, but you get beaten to a pulp by a damn plant. Pathetic.

One week without that poison, and you notice a difference already. Yesterday you fixed the whole kitchen, washed several rounds, made good breakfast, went for a long walk in the sun with a good friend (and enjoyed it!), Fixed things at work (and got kudos TWICE in a group meeting!). Savor that feeling of doing something good for a change, and actually contributing. Compare that to when you spent two weeks on the simplest tasks, and that knot in your stomach grew every time you filled out the timesheet, each meeting you expected to be exposed as the fraud you are. Do you remember how sweet it felt to have done shit, and done well? You have some word recall again and can write and formulate your thoughts somewhat (but your English still suuuuucks). You didn’t just struggle with ‘big’ words (you know there's a better phrase but can’t find it), literally anything could just disappear in the middle of a sentence, it will be at the tip of your tongue but not come out. You’ll go on a tangent and lose your point. In conversation with your boss, even. Cringe. 

Write with purpose, not for karma. Read books, not /r/Politics. Get out into the fresh air, not because you want a different view when you smoke, but because that's where life is. The life you miss, and you’re missing out on. “Life is what happens when you are busy making other plans”, except you don’t even have a plan, or any intentions to make one. Where’s your ambition? Don’t you have dreams???

You had a perfect childhood and are probably better off than 90% of the world. You have every opportunity, but waste your energy on finding reasons to postpone it until tomorrow. But tomorrow never comes, just another “not now”. You are full of ideas, but no one bothers to listen anymore, not even yourself, because you do nothing about it anyway. Still, you have the nerve to look down on your friends who are just getting drunk. DO SOMETHING. Start something even if it fails, the lessons you learned are forever. Don't give up just because you don't make gold overnight. The road is the goal, but no one can walk it for you.

Remember how happy you were the last time you had a break! How proud you were to have ""beaten"" it, how everyone you know complimented the new you, even those who didn't know the reason. You were happier in every way, a better friend, father, son, brother, lover. You did not have a guilty conscience daily, you didn’t have to plan every day around whether you had weed or could smoke. Please don't go back there, I’m literally begging you. Don't think for a second are in control, because you have disproved it time and time again. You wouldn’t serve alcohol or give a car to someone who has been drunk driving again and again, because it is only a matter of time before they kill themselves or someone else. Be glad you are not worse off. 

Be glad weed is your vice, and that you don’t enjoy alcohol or coke, or you would be dead or in jail by now. You haven't accomplished anything in the last 10 years and it doesn't get any easier as you get older. Maybe you’ve learned your lesson this time, maybe you can only smoke every weekend, or concert. But it’s just not worth the gamble, the stakes are too high no matter how small you think the odds are. You're fucking done now, for good. It’s not a break, it’s not gonna happen sporadically. You’ve smoked enough for 10 lifetimes. Thousands of cigarettes down your lungs, kilos of weed clogging your brain, so so much money you could have spent on travel, hobbies, an apartment, savings, investing, [child]’s college fund. You should be ashamed that it went so far, but be proud that it is over. Keep your head held high while you tell everyone who needs to know, you need the support. I love you and only wish you only but the best. We can do this, buddy.

Reading this sub when I was quitting helped me focus on my goal of sobriety, and I hope that someone out there finds similar benefit by reading about my experience.

I have been an off and on, mostly on, smoker for the last 25 years.

My usage started reasonably enough, primarily weekends, and evenings after work.  After some time I found myself also getting high before heading into work. The residual smell of it kept me from smoking at work, but eventually I picked up a dab rig, and convinced myself no one would notice that odor.  When I quit, I was taking up to 10 dabs a day, starting with a dab before my morning coffee, and ending with a dab right before going to sleep.

I told myself that being high all the time was living life in ""hard mode.""  I thought I was successful at it, but looking back now, I see many failures and missed opportunities that I was apathetic about in the moment.  In retrospect, I believe there are people I work with who noticed how baked I was all the time, and I'm truly thankful to still be employed.

I quit mostly because of the head fog.  I lost vocabulary.  Words that I knew were there just wouldn't come to my mind when I wanted to use them.  I would start a sentence, and forget what I was trying to say before I could finish it.  I instantly forgot names of people I met.  I forgot the names of people I hadn't seen in a while.  My work performance suffered.  I was still capable of my job, but my motivation to stick with a problem dwindled after 2 minutes.  My mind was always on the next dab.

Quitting was uncomfortable at first.  I couldn't concentrate on anything for a week.  I was irritable, and required frequent reminders of why it was worth it.  I went for walks, I read this sub, and I started exercising regularly.  I picked up one of my favorite books, and started reading again.

Two weeks into my quit, I decided I had to quit caffeine.  I had been using using it to get back level after each dab.  Without the marijuana, the caffeine left me jittery, and unfocussed.  I don't miss it now, and I am getting great sleep.

I started remembering my dreams again after about 3 weeks.  Some of them were quite intense at first, but they eventually settled down, and I am grateful to have dreams as part of my life again.

The head fog has slowly lifted, and I'm starting to feel mostly normal again.  It took several months before short term memory returned, and I'm glad to report that I have been able to effectively participate in conversations without pausing to search for words, and it has been a relief to discover that I haven't permanently damaged my ability to learn new things.

My work performance has improved.  I've received positive feedback from my coworkers after having completed larger projects.  My inbox is no longer full of unread email, and I close tickets for work that I have completed.  I still drop balls here and there, but now I've been able to pick them back up and start running again.

I don't blame pot for my bad habits.  I procrastinated before I ever smoked my first joint.  Being high, though, exacerbates that behavior.  It is easy to ignore consequences when they leave your consciousness as quickly as they arrive.  Sobriety has allowed me to be keenly aware of my failures and be more likely to address them.

Every afternoon, evening and dinner we have a joint of hash and tobacco (almost a whole cigarette worth). The thing is they are my family and they will easily support my decision to be clean during this lockdown. But, for some reason, I cannot bring myself to tell them that I want to quit smoking marijuana. I am convinced that there is a part of me that is afraid of losing this herb. I have been smoking weed since 2010 and have been consuming it very heavily for past 8 months (bong rips, joints, chillums, you name it) 

I am generally perceived as a cheerful, smart, intellectual with a huge potential. But I know I am not working towards becoming my best version. It's so simple - I have to just tell them that I don't want to smoke and they will actually support me (or perhaps never put hash in front of me again during this lockdown) but, somehow I am scared to tell them. Or am I just scared to be sober? 

The problem to quit when you're a heavy user (and when is life is jusk ok without putting any serious effort) is that you forget what sobriety feels like. You forget what true enjoyment is. Due to excessive smoking my entertainment has been reduced to easy dopamine inducing activities such as watching endless movies and TV shows, masturbating multiple times daily to porn, playing video games and watching endless streams of Pros. 

The moment the urge comes for getting high (or watching porn or browse YouTube) it feels, paradoxically, overwhelming and, at the same time, easy to resist. But somehow, with almost a 3rd person view of myself, I find myself simply reaching for the hash and tobacco and start rolling. Then after I'm high, I think back on why did I smoke? Why didn't I just get up from the place and do something else? The present moment in which I can take action, I end up making the wrong choice. 


I had quit Reddit previously, but I was feeling desperate to share my thoughts with someone (anyone). Everybody I know smokes weed and lives a seemingly normal life (good colleges, high paying job, etc) but I know that I cannot smoke daily. Moreover, I always get the feeling that only I have issues with Marijuana and all my friends are ok with staying high everyday. 

I'd like to believe that I can smoke occassionally, but I know that it easily spirals out of control and becomes a daily habit very easily. Sobriety, feels like to me, is not a luxury but a necessity.",6,2

It has been strange in the first few days but nearly not as bad as I expected. Since i know i'm limited by external factors, not smoking does not really bother me.

I wanted to quit before but never made it past a week, a week and a half, hence why I lurk on this sub. It was like an itch, knowing that all it took was a half an hour trip to meet up with my guy, and i would be set for 3-4 days, and i just had to scratch it.

Turning 29 in 13 days.

Bear with me on this, it comes back to weed:

I have been having extremely strong feelings for my co-worker. Our job is such that her and I spend a lot of downtime together -- literally hours where we have no supervision and just talk. 

Over the past 1.5 years we've become close friends, hanging out outside of work, being supportive of each other. She made me feel great about everything I am insecure about, because she told me -- you're handsome, you're smart, you're kind, you're funny. That said, she has a BF, they live together, and she loves him a lot. I valued the friendship immensely. I am at a very lonely place in my life and she is the only person I consistently talk too.

Since getting off the weed though, I noticed I was living in a fantasy. I promised myself I would never tell her how I feel, but deep, deep down this was because I knew how pathetic that would sound while she is in a relationship. I didn't want to sound pathetic because I was waiting for the relationship to end, then we could be together. I dated girls just to date them, to show her I can date too.

She got mad at me leading up to the confession. Asking why I am being so distant. I told her yesterday, it's too painful to be your friend and let's just try and be cordial at work. I knew she didn't feel the same way, I just told her because the pain of a one-sided relationship was unbearable without the weed fantasies. As oppose to just pushing her way, she deserved closure, despite how humiliating it was for me.

The pain is real. Very real. I lost my best friend, someone who did so much for my confidence, and, honestly, someone I thought I would eventually be with. She says she thinks we can still be friends, how much she cares about me, she wrote a long note explaining all this, but understanding its my decision and she respects it.

So where does weed come into play? Well, although I truly wanted to be her friend, as I said, I was living a lie. When you smoke weed all day, day dreams become reality while you sit at home playing with yourself. I couldn't be her friend without trying to make her more than that, no matter how hard I tried. 

But guess what, now I have even *less* desire to smoke. My therapist, who saw me in hysterics, said maybe I should smoke (it was because he was concerned for my safety and I live in a state where weed is prescribed for anxiety, which I have a really bad case of, even before the weed). But I didn't.

I hurt, but sort of like detox and recovery, this hurt is part of a larger healing process.

As for the breakdown, I thought I was going to have to go to the ER, serious suicidal ideation. But I got on youtube and listened to comedy, had some gatorade, and fell asleep. Woke up today feeling like crap, went on a walk, had some food, and listened to Loveline (an old radio show that talks a lot about addiction and hardship in general), and I feel a lot better. It's hard knowing things can be so painful and lonesome that it makes you want to end it all, but I got through somehow. One more day where I can claim to be victor. One more day where I am still here.

I’m could start anywhere on this long and ironically hazy journey but I’ll start from the beginning. It all started way back in early 2017 while I was still in high school. I had been wishing to try weed for the first time and my friends were nudging me to actually (can you believe it...) not try weed. These were good people I have grown apart from through time. 

Anyways, ready or not the seed was planted. I searched constantly to find it and low and behold my best friend had some because he knew that it was going to be his weed or risky boof, so he invited me over. After that first lighter flick, I knew I was hooked. This warm feeling felt nice at first and for the first 2 years the habit was okay. Smoking once every few weeks or months until I slowly but surely spiraled out of control. (I.e. why are carts so easy to get hooked on? Fuck.) this brings me to our current fucked year 2020. 

Now this is where it’s turns around for me. I had already been caught by the principle for selling weed. Wanna know the funny thing about that? My own mother ratted me out. He pulled me out of class and talked to me for a few hours and I even got him to empathize with some problems I had been having at my homelife. He didn’t even search me... I had 3 ounces in me that day... that’s a felony if you didn’t know. Again, anyways, I really started smoking way too much this year in college. I’m high when I wake up from the night before, I get higher in the mornings, high between lectures, more high during homework. I even smoke weed while fucking just to feel it. I have over thousands of dollars worth of carts in my possession that have all been used and about 3 days ago I took a long hard look in the mirror and asked myself if this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I said no, I chose to be free from the addiction. 

And thus brings me to my conclusion, I know I can and will stay strong and if even I relapse I’ll get up, brush the dust off and keep on because I’ve had enough, I choose me, I believe in me and I love me. I don’t need weed to see that. I don’t need weed to feel that. I don’t need it at all period. Thank you for listening and I hope you are all well during this chaotic time❤️.",4,0

I really thought I was alone in how I felt about stopping smoking. This is going to be a long post because I have no idea how to express myself.

28/CA/Male I'm an introvert with a social battery. At the end of a hard day, I smoke to relax and focus my scattered mind. My life overall is awesome and I'm very thankful, but mentally and emotionally I have my flaws, as a high strung person or succumbing to depressive episodes. I usually smoke to do an attitude adjustment or mute never ending swarm of negative thoughts.

Usually when I smoke it's a good time, I mellow out and I have fun with my inside hobbies. Recently, I haven't been as creative or motivated to do anything. Even the things I'm passionate about like video editing or photography. I see everything as work and I can't hold any focus. I would just get high and sit there. Either I play video games, watch movies, or jerk off. I also would go to bed super high so my thoughts don't impede me falling asleep. My procrastination habits have become much worse to where I would even put off assignments to courses I really enjoy being in or not progress on deliverables that are fun like making fun youtube videos with friends. Now that social battery I have is now gone, and I turn off my cellphone creating a small case of agoraphobia. I don't want to talk to anyone or do anything when I'm high.

The last time I smoked was at the start of the shelter in place, I bought an 8th and figured, hey lets smoke myself into oblivion. There's no repercussions and the world is stagnant. I can turn my phone off and have no responsibilities and forget anyone to stay in contact with. I have nothing to do and it's mando to stay inside now. 3 weeks pass and my stash is now empty. I went into the deep end and I have accomplished..nothing. I am no more relaxed than before. Continually chasing that stoney baloney feeling. I would go into a repeated cycle of ""Oh I'll do it tomorrow"" but once i wake up that bong is in my hands and I lie to myself that I can operate high.

I am currently out of weed and I am doing my best to not run to the dispensary and buy another 8th (cause it's really easy and cheap).

I do notice some changes like I am able to sleep unassisted but it took 3 days of no sleep to finally put me back onto a ""normal"" sleep schedule. Other than that, I notice no change. I'm more frustrated than usual (even when I'm playing video games) I STILL am procrastinating on assignments. I'm literally just doing the same habits but sober instead of high. I am wondering if I'll get better as the days go by.

what do you all think?  


TL;DR went into the deep end, smoking a bunch and getting high everyday. Made bad habits. Stopped but going through tough width drawls. Bad habits still persist despite being sober. wondering if it will get better.",4,0

I had several panic attacks, one that made me go to the ER because I was convinced I was dying(I wasn't) After that bad one I watched a couple youtube videos from psychiatrists on how to handle panic attacks and they basically said to ignore it and if you don't think about it it'll go away in 5-10 minutes. Me being an over thinker, I would try to fight it and that only made it worse and brought on more symptoms. Anyways I haven't had any panic attacks since then but am prepared in the event I do.

I used to clear half-gram cartridges in 2-3 days sometimes, I was that bad. But now, I have absolutely no intention of turning back. Last time I went 25 days and blew it, I didn’t end up smoking just once like I had promised myself and fell right back into the pitfall. What’s worse, I didn’t even enjoy it! So now I know there is *no reason* to relapse. I won’t like it; it won’t be the same as it was back in the early days when it was all new, pleasurable and adventurous. I won’t like it, and neither will you!

I’ve had all sorts of revelations throughout this journey. 

(1) You CAN get addicted to exercise. I always thought people were full of shit when they talked about runner’s highs and all that. It’s not really anything the first few days, but if you get into a routine, you do legitimately crave it and it *does* fill the void. You can be addicted to good things. I’m also addicted to meditation right now, and you get the benefit of being proud of yourself!

(2) Dreams are INCREDIBLE. I know this isn’t the same for everyone, and I do have nightmares from time to time, but I find when I meditate often and enter sleep with a mindset of looking forward to escaping reality, it is the greatest adventure and the ultimate solace from the rules of society. I feel like it’s similar to psychedelics. A positive mindset can make this better. Maybe I’m full of shit there, but for me personally, dreams are incredible and I was missing out on them for way too long. And they make for better rest.

(3) This is going to be so vain. But I keep on admiring my eyes in the mirror. It really hit me how much more pure I am just in my appearance. Gone is the zombified glazed over look. My eyes give away that I am high on life.

(4) The grass IS greener without smoking grass! I swear, I’ve undergone so much change in my life over the past couple of years that I should have been proud of. But there was always something missing. I wasn’t getting the full experience with life and feeling. Because, I was literally always on drugs! Just replace the word “stoner” with “drug addict” and boom. I couldn’t go a day without it, or at least without craving it. It was taken over my life. And it is *gone*, baby. I literally can’t get over how much better it feels to be in the moment, and to be present for all of my achievements. And for the negatives. You shouldn’t always be escaping, and sadness and anger are important. I’ll take the higher highs with the lower lows, and I’m having vastly more good days than bad.

Despite all that’s happening, and the stress and the urgency of this situation, this is the VERY BEST time to quit! If you’re on the fence, just do it! You are literally never going to have this chance again, ever. What are you waiting for?",7,0

As one moderator put it to me around day 30 when I was weak and ready to give up:

""One day at a time"" isn't just some mantra, like ""hang in there,"" it is a cold, hard strategy for dealing with things like this. Just promise yourself you won't smoke today. If you really want to you are welcome to smoke tomorrow, but no matter what, don't smoke today. Then when tomorrow comes promise yourself the same thing.

* I start feeling really warm in the evenings, like 1-2 hours before going to bed.
* Falling asleep is pretty easy and usually happens within 15min. No real insomnia.
* No weird/vivid dreams, in fact no dreams at all. This one confuses me because I used to get loads of them during previous attempts. Almost feels like I'm not doing it right...
* Night sweats. Some nights not at all, most nights I do get them, some nights pretty bad.
* I sleep less than I used to. I'm never in bed for longer than 7 hours, so actual sleep time is probably closer to 6 hours. I'd say I probably get around 5 hours of good sleep, wake up on a moist pillow (and flip/replace it if it's bad) and then spend the next hour or two in very shallow toss-n-turn sleep/limbo. It feels like that last part isn't healthy, my head is even more tired after that phase of burying itself into the pillow desperately trying to stay in sleep mode.

I'd like to sleep more, a good 8 hours would be perfect. I do feel and look tired but after 7 hours in bed I just can't sleep anymore. It's actually very consistent. Then again, maybe sleeping less is just a part of growing older which I didn't notice before because I was effectively tranquilizing myself every night.

All in all I'm very pleased with how week 1 went. I'm actually looking forward to going another week and seeing what happens, and then another and another...

Today makes 46 days without weed for me. 

My relationship with weed started when I was about 16. Throughout my teens, I was a very occasional smoker. Maybe once a month, but not very regular. 

It wasn't until my junior year of college (2014) that I started to buy weed to keep at home. At that point I was smoking 2 or 3 times a week. It was like my sanctuary. I would come home after a long day of classes and rehearsals, and smoke on the back porch. My family lived on a lake, so oftentimes, I would just sit out there and get high while listening to the water slap against the docks. It was so peaceful. It became my way to shut out the world and whatever stresses life was throwing at me. It would make me really nostalgic and I enjoyed the escape. 

My relationship with weed remained pretty recreational until I graduated college. After graduation, a lot of things happened in my life that really sent me into an increasingly difficult place. I moved to Atlanta, away from my family that I had always been close to. I felt more separated and lonely than I ever had in my life. I was also going through an emotionally toxic relationship that was breaking my psyche down. I started turning to weed for comfort and I started smoking daily. 

I remember waking up one day after about 3 months of consecutive daily smoking and realizing that I was losing touch with reality. My brother, who has been the person closest to me all my life, started commenting on how I was ""changing"". That was the first time I decided I'd take a break, and failed. I think I went like 2 days without it before smoking again with some friends and falling right back into the habit. I consider that to be the start of my addiction. That was the first time I realized that I was gonna have trouble giving it up. 

Since then, I’ve had small stints of time where I’d give up weed, but I’ve mostly smoked every day for the past 5 years. I joined a band, where I met some of my very best friends, who also smoke. We moved into a house together, where smoking was just a part of our lives. We smoked together multiple times a day, every day, whether we were at home, or on gigs, and to be honest with you guys, I really loved smoking. It became a part of my identity. I was 100% a bonafide stoner, and I just embraced it. I would struggle with feeling like I smoked too often from time to time, but it was never enough to actually make me seriously stop. 

That changed when I met the woman who is now my wife. We met in August of 2018, and it was one of those situations in life where I just knew that she was my person. She knew from the start of our relationship that I was a daily smoker, and although she wasnt a fan of it, she dated me anyway. As our relationship grew, it became more and more of an issue for me to smoke. She didn't like the idea of me being dependent on something, and she would ask me how being high everyday was really different from being drunk everyday. As time went on, I started to see her point. Being high was bringing about a separation between us. It wasn't that weed was inherently bad, but my relationship with it was a dependent one. Why couldn’t I live life without it and be happy? I started really asking myself that

That question really started to bug me. Was weed really the source of my happiness? Why did I feel that life was just better with it? So much better, in fact, that I was willing to buy it and make my wife uncomfortable by bringing it into our home. She would tolerate it, and she's done her best to understand, but why was it so worth it to me? I wrestled with those questions every time I smoked and eventually I started smoking less and less, until I ran out of weed 46 days ago. 

To be honest, I was planning on buying more, but I never got around to it. It seemed like everytime I tried to buy some, something would get in the way. Sometimes my dealer would flake, and others I just couldn't bring myself to spend the money on it.  My wife is pregnant now and everytime I think of buying weed, I consider where that money could go to help us prepare for the birth of my son. She’s due any day now, and so I can't imagine getting high and not being sober and present to assist her in every way I can once labor begins. 

So I’ve been 46 days without it. 


It still crosses my mind every day. The urge to wanna smoke. But I've been able to push it away.  I still talk to my wife about it. I’m honest with her about my cravings, and I share the nostalgic memories that I have about it with her, and that helps a lot. Just being honest about how and what I’m feeling. I don’t know how long I’ll stay on this train, but for now, I know that this is the right thing to do. I’ll check back in later and update. 

Thank you to everyone who has shared their own stories. This community has been a big help",27,0

As the second semester of my first year started and I turned 19 (the legal age to buy weed and alcohol), it slowly became a daily thing I did with my roommate. It came to a point where the pressure of my schoolwork dipped and I started smoking every day. When I tried stopping after a few weeks, I literally pulled all-nighters because I couldn't sleep without it.   
I moved into a new apartment with a new roommate the following Fall and the past 2 years has pretty much involved smoking weed almost every day (I've spent summers at home so didn't really smoke there) either in the form of dab pens or just flower.

I have been to several places and I always thought that weed could ""always find me"", but I guess I was just blind to the efforts I was making to find it throughout all this time.

I come from a family of drug abusers, and while I can say that I have tried most things, I have never been able to leave marijuana behind. Money, relationships, friendships fell by the wayside, as I convinced myself that weed was something that ""I chose"", and would continue to choose over relating with ""prejudiced fools"". After entering a PhD in the humanities, I have amassed an arsenal of philosophy-based arguments as to why smoking was okay, why it was essentially treatment, why ""abusing"" was a misconception of the human connection with plants. While I don't think these arguments are entirely made up or invalid, I have definitely been using them as an excuse to just continue abusing weed. It is time I get real with myself.

I come from a very shitty household, lots of physical and verbal abuse, so first studying (growing up), then smoking weed (after my mother passed away in adolescence), and then finally both together (in college) became my safe haven. Smoking would make me functional insofar as it helped me avoid a constant negative affective bias. Sitting on a plane for a long haul flight without edibles meant hours of mental torture, just rehashing dozens upon dozens of occasions from my growing up, pent up anger burning inside of me, random jerk movements from almost unbearable anxiety. With the recent COVID-19 situation, a trip that I had scheduled back to my home country (I do my PhD in the US) ended up getting extended, and it was all bad. My father is a very abusive person who deals with his own alcoholism, cocaine addiction, and 10+ years abuse of benzos (specifically Klonopin), and at an old age he seems either completely okay with his situation or way beyond saving. I have never been close to him, but now everybody else is dead and it is just the two of us, so at first I tried reconnecting -- including doing coke with him on occasions, in order to try to reach a new level of openness in conversation -- but the benefits of those moments would never carry over new engagements when sober, and his toxic masculinity is too strong for him to think that any kind of therapy, talk-based or full-on psychiatry, is ""for pussies"". On top of that, grad school is incredibly stressful, and today there are many discussions as to how the grad student population is facing exponentially higher levels of depression vis-à-vis people in other career paths.

I had to leave my home country after things with my father came to a head: down there I was smoking so much weed to control the anxiety attacks that I felt like I wasn't even getting high anymore. I am now self-quarantining at a small airbnb at the hometown of my girlfriend, who is the one person that -- with unbelievable patience, I must admit -- opened my mind and helped me break down my own prejudices towards therapy. Her parents really like me, but have no idea of my struggle with weed, which gives me this horrible feeling that I am hiding this from them when they have nothing but love for me. I am on day 3 of a full-on cold turkey stop, and I don't even know where/how to get it here, really (although I know that if I wanted, I could get it, because I have always been able to).

I don't feel a craving for smoking so much as a craving for not feeling like I do right now, which is how I have been feeling for a long long time, suppressing it with weed, remaining functional and fooling myself into thinking that it made everything okay. I just got back from a pharmacy with my first batch of prescribed anti-depressants, a delicate decision that took a couple of years of therapy to reach. I am confident that I will kick it this time (too many stop attempts to count them here), because I finally got through the necessary logical pathways to know that I need to choose myself. I'm tired of alienating my productive potential with weed. Is this a familiar scenario to somebody else: getting very excited towards something creative -- playing music, writing a poem, even playing a game -- then getting home, rolling joint after joint while thinking about it, and ending up not doing it at all.

I wish the anxiety and depression would go away immediately, I wish I could get my sleep back, I wish I could eat (the suggestion of the shakes and smoothies that I saw here is a true godsend), I wish I could just do all the things that I once enjoyed rather than smoking and watching youtube videos. But I know that is a slow process, even the meds take one to four weeks to fully kick in with their benefits, but I am committed to it, and I know I will win. I woke up with a horrible mood, shit-sleep obviously, but finding this group did a complete 180 for my mood. I even had to sign up for a reddit account just to feel like I am part of this community.

I don't know any of you, but already have a feeling that I am not alone in this. I wonder, with the whole quarantine thing, if any of you would want to do a Zoom meeting, maybe get to know each other, exchange stories. Together is much easier than alone. I was lucky to have people (that I love, as well as  professionals) that had all the patience in the world to walk this very slow walk towards a sense of safety in recovery with me. I see a community here, and I think we can stand up for each other, walk together.

Sending everyone love. Let us not forget to be patient with ourselves. I don't want to make it sound like I made it: I am going up the walls, I hate the world right now, I can't read a book, I can't even muster the motivation to do laundry today. But the more I sense other humans -- and what the great anthropologist Victor Turner called ""communitas"", a shared sense of humanness with one's peers -- the more I feel like I can do this, and this is a small price to pay for the rewards down the line.",3,2

It feels like God or whatever teased me with this little taste of what my life could be and then ripped it all away again.

I felt like I could think again, and after smoking today, I just do not even understand why I do this so much.

Like many of you, I have vowed to quit seshing only to be found smoking a joint or ripping a bowl a few days (or in some instances, minutes later lol)

I am now 28(m) and at a point where I am fed up with being a sedated zombie for the majority of the day. I am quite certain that I have undiagnosed ADHD that has developed into adult ADHD and weed really helps deal with the my constant unrest. Smoking a nice joint, working out and going for runs are the perfect solution, however there have been spill over effects (constant zombie state, stoner eyes, loss of motivation to do other things).

I want to go through a period of being sober for 30 days, and I think that the main impediment to this is my perspective. When i evaluate my thoughts, I find that when I’m sober I’m constantly thinking, “this song will be amazing after a j” or “this meal will be incredible after a j” or “this movie is gonna be sooo goood...but first a j”. This thinking keeps me stuck, and constantly smoking. 


The current global quarantine has been difficult for me, having nothing but idle on my hands. I feel sedated, that’s how I’ve been getting. But deep down, I have a burning desire to break free of the need to do this and find better outlets. The first step is to change, what I believe to be the primary antagonist to smoking weed which is my perspective. 

My question is to all: 

Were there any changes to your perspective on smoking, staying sober or both that let you to manage quitting better? Can you please share? 

An example would be: “my perspective has changed when x, y, or z happened”. I have to re-learn enjoy life when I’m sober again! 

Condensed version: were there any perspectives or outlooks on weed/ Functioning without it that contributed to you quitting? / what were your biggest obstacles to quitting and how did you overcome them?

Thanks to you all.

Edit: 
I want to answer some questions that I've been asked about my journey thus far:

I started smoking weed when I was around 20/21, and by the time I was 23, I was a pothead (I'm 30 now). I abused marijuana because I was depressed, lost and confused about my life trajectory, and wanted to numb the pain I felt about my career, and my family dynamics. I ruined many MANY relationships due to weed. I was not a thoughtful or present friend, and I went through long periods of time feeling lonely and misunderstood. I struggled with how to maintain my relationships, I couldn't keep up hobbies, my mental health tanked and I continued using weed to numb the pain.

I knew that I had to quit smoking for about 2 years before I actually did it. I was always bargaining with my addiction and trying to find a way, any way, to keep the high going. I cheated on urine tests (don't ask), stole from people, lied to get high.  Last April I hit rock bottom because at that point I had been smoking before and after work, and my performance suffered as a result. This also triggered further negative self-talk, and I smoked even more in order to cope. Finally, I was terminated due to an overall shitty performance, and I was RELIEVED because I knew that this was as bad as it could get and I had to make a change. I smoked my last J on April 7th 2019. 

The road to recovery sucked for a long time before it got better. I have had brief stints of sobriety (no more than 3 months) in the past, but always went back. This time I was so desperate for change that I found myself in NA/MA meetings, reading self-help books, meditating, changing my social circle. Just anything to get over the hump. I downloaded ""I Am Sober"" so that I could hold myself accountable (highly recommend). I knew that if I could just get to 6 months, I could get to a year. The normal withdrawals were there at first. I remember during the first few weeks having this....hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach. It wasn't hunger...it was just emptiness. Emptiness at my core that I normally filled with weed. Waking up and not being able to fill that was incredibly hard to face. I cried a lot. and I also felt all of the anger, disappointment in myself, resentment, and sadness that I had allowed myself to ignore over the years. 

Getting clean didn't make me or my life perfect. I am so imperfect it's hilarious. But I am self-aware and I have the drive to improve as much as I can. I can feel emotions, I can feel bored and be ok with it. I can exercise, meditate, keep my space clean, and perform well at work without looking for a ""treat"" like a dog. I'm a grown ass woman! These are things that I'm supposed to do! I don't need a treat for getting up and handling my f*cking business. Idk I've just leveled up as a human being and I appreciate it. 

Someone asked if I crave weed anymore. No. The truth that I didn't want to face was that it hadn't felt ""good"" to smoke weed for a long time. In fact, it was starting to suck. I didnt like how I felt at all. I didn't like how my day would be gone as soon as I lit up. The problem was that I was so stuck in the web that I couldn't get out of the habit, so I convinced myself that I liked it. 

If I could give any advice at this point, it would be to please keep going. You went however many years of your life before that first toke surviving and living JUST FINE without weed. You don't NEED this. Not to be happy, not to be social, not to find a movie interesting, not to eat, not to fuck. Remove the veil and take a closer look at who you really are inside. Also, relapse is a part of the journey. Don't hate yourself for slipping up. Get back on that horse and don't look back. Forgive yourself for your past mistakes and love yourself enough to know that you deserve the best that life can offer. It's not over for you!

I smoke way more cigarettes than I ever did when smoking bud.

First 2 months or so we're really hard. I've had to cut contact with most of my weed smoking friends, and when you stop smoking you realize how many of your friends have avoided you because of smoking and you realize how many of your friends become ex-friends now that weed doesn't keep your friendship alive. This isn't bad, most of those ex-friends are people that I can't see myself hanging out with anymore.. Marijuana is their main focus in life and they don't have any ambitions or plans in their life except how to buy more weed. After the first 2 months you feel like you're on top of the world, you kicked the habit and nothing is holding you back anymore, you feel in charge of your life. You start getting shit done, you get your life together. What helped me is that I started making plans and to-do lists that I keep up with on the regular. Ask yourself how will my life look like in 5 years if I continue like this? How will my life look like if put in consistent effort in bettering myself and chasing my plans and dreams? You start to remember things better after 2 months, you get clarity of mind. After about 7-9 months I got used to being straight, so I was like why did I even stop smoking? Then i revisited this sub and saw some posts that i bookmarked and they gave me more motivation to stay healthy and not smoke this shit. After about 5 months new hardships in life appear, but you deal with them. You don't just put them under the carpet and smoke a joint. I've had 2 girlfriends since I stopped and several one night stands, one broke my heart but I still fought on and did 3 exams and worked odd jobs so I can get money, in spite of my emotional pain. If you're still reading at this point then I should probably add in more tips, pros and cons. Prayer helped me a lot, weed started hurting my organism, in the last few days of my weed use, I decided to overload my system with weed and smoke inhumane ammounts. That's when I felt really sick of it and decided the date when I was gonna stop once and for all. I've been on and off for about half a year before I managed to quit once and for all. Last 2 times i smoked i've had diarrhea with drawbacks. You should stop on the first of the month. Write that date down. Before that date, smoke a shit ton. All at once, you'll feel so bad that you'll remind yourself why weed is bad. Start going to the gym. /r/leaves **isn't just about recovering from weed, it's about self improvement and that's why I think a lot of you will find this useful.** Read books, pray, make a to do list for tommorow and for the next month. Congratulate yourself at the end of the day. Have someone to talk to about this, it isn't a must but it can be helpful. Start taking cold showers, first thing in the morning wake up take a warm shower and finish it with 2 minutes cold water. Then eat and go to the gym or excercise at home. Then study or go to work, both is even better. At weekends go to parties and play sports, football helps me since i get to run a lot and increase my stamina (european football). Cut contact with anything that has to do with weed. When someone asks if you want to toke, don't brag and say NAH MAN I DON'T SMOKE THAT SHIT WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT etc. , just politely decline. At one point people will start to congratulate you that you stopped and they will realize you mean it for good.

SPECIFIC - lay out exactly what you want to do. 

Examples:
Smoke 4 times a week instead of 7.
Smoke 2 grams a week instead of 4.
Only get high once a day.

MEASURABLE- easily evaluate your progress

Use frequency of smoking or weight of weed smoked to accurately track consumption to meet your goals.

ACHIEVABLE- don’t set a goal you can’t complete

Setting a goal that is impossible and setting yourself up for failure will do nothing but weaken your drive to quit. Make sure that whatever you aim to do, it is within reason. However, don’t use this as an excuse to set a goal that isn’t hard enough and doesn’t create real change. Your goal should stretch your abilities while still being possible.

RELEVANT- make sure your goal aligns with you and your other goals

It’s easier to stick to a goal if you can identify why it matters. Use this section to write down all the benefits you get from quitting and all the cons that you face from continuing to smoke. Connect it to your other goals in life to reinforce why the withdrawals and the hardships of quitting are worth it.

TIME BOUND - Set a time-frame that you will achieve your goal by.

This is perhaps the most important point of all. We have all had thoughts of “oh I should really quit this is terrible for me and hurting my life”, but we often don’t act on them. By putting a time frame on your goal you can motivate yourself to change and become the person that you want to be. It won’t be easy to meet your time frame, but it is an important step in quitting.


Remember that SMART goals only work if you are 100% committed to following through with it. If the cravings ever get too intense, look at the list of pros and cons you made and ask yourself if you really want to smoke weed, or if that’s your addiction doing your thinking for you.

Also, remember that if you aren’t getting better, you’re getting worse. Once you achieve your goal, set a new goal that helps you continue improving. 

Using smart goals allows us to hold ourselves accountable for our actions. No more saying “just this once” or “I’ve earned this”, it’s time to be the change and make the change that you wish to see in yourself.",33,0

With everything going on in the world, I felt like it wasn't serving me anymore, and had my anxiety through the roof.

Maybe I'm in the minority but the seriousness of the global situation almost made it easier for me to stop. Felt like it was now or never.

I've dropped 15 pounds from not eating late, and not binge eating. 

Lucid dreams! Some nonsensical, but all very memorable now.

I feel like I'm at more of a medium now, instead of my mood swinging up and down. 

The one downfall is I got very upset about a personal issue the other day and it was hard to calm down, definitely an area of my life to work on.

Going for a run, doing some yoga, and cooking my own meals all helped greatly to keep myself in a decent state of mind.

I'm 37 today, and I'm ready for a new chapter in my life.

It was a long time coming and with quarantine and lockdown, I couldn't put myself or my partner at risk with me sourcing my next bag.

The first few days were awesome. I felt a real buzz from knowing that I was actually doing it. I had been using weed to help 'recover' from the effects of PTSD... however after using daily for more than 3 years I realised that my crutch had actually become the thing that was holding me back. I don't regret using it as a way to cope in the beginning. Before I found therapy and realised that I was experiencing symptoms of trauma, weed made me able to cope with daily activities it allowed me to feel some joy and levity. However, there has definitely been a tipping point and I know in my heart it was holding me back from the next chapter. 

Whilst I don't necessarily have cravings and want to smoke again, day 3 and 4 are hard. I feel so upset, so up and down and overwhelmed. My body has been sore and I just recently started feeling nauesous. 

I have never used a community like this for help, but this morning I feel low. To know I am not alone in this journey would be a great source of comfort for me.

One big thing I'm looking forward to//feeling is that I will be able to cut the munchies which I think have been such a big part of my life I didn't even realize their intensity. I'm much more regulated in my cravings for food.   
I wouldn't describe my thoughts about weed right now as cravings, certainly not nostalgia, but some bizarre curiosity--one that I know is not helpful per se, one which says ""hmm yeah, maybe in a few weeks I'll want to smoke again.""   
I have a big deadline coming up, after which 'nothing matters,' but I think racing to the deadline without weed will hopefully make me want to do all kinds of other things instead of smoke.

I love reading everyone’s stories, it puts a huge smile on my face :) 

Before I start I want to say I am 21 years old from USA- 

- I THINK I am struggling with weed & would love all of your advices?

Here is my predicament... I don’t KNOW if I want to quit, but I feel that to become the person I know I am meant to be in life.. a family man... a husband (hopefully) , a business man.. these are dreams of mine... 

Even though all of your success stories put huge smiles on my face.. I don’t KNOW if I can or WANT to stop... even though this kills me inside knowing I could be giving up my dreams, I continue to smoke... and it’s painful emotionally. So I just end up smoking more to numb those feelings. I just don’t know... 

Not sure if this means anything but I recently stopped smoking for about a week and was puking for 2-3 days, tired and always very angry/irritable. 

Is this what withdrawal is? And If withdrawal is horrendous like this... it makes me question how much I have been smoking... These feelings went away after day 5-6 but I ended up smoking last Friday night with a friend and have been back to my usual habits of “once I get high... I’m staying high until I go to sleep” and I got high pretty early in the day...

I'm a 17 year old that lives in a state where marijuana is illegal. I have a buddy from high school that I get my carts from, and another friend that I occassionally get flower from. Dangerous because it's illegal, yes, I know. 

I started with weed last summer, I took my mom's edibles she got from CO. She doesn't like the feeling, so it went unnoticed for about 7 months. I, however, loved it. After that, I started to hit my friends up for some. That made me go from every two weeks, to every week, to eventually every day. I was smoking carts heavily over Christmas, and a shit ton over Jan-Feb. I've prayed that I can stop many times, and it wasn't until I ran out recently that I have stopped. I smoked the last of my flower on March 27, and I haven't had any since. The problem is that I CANNOT stop thinking about it. I have to relearn everything. Showers feel dull because I would smoke in there. It's boring to sleep, I don't have any drive to do anything anymore. When I was smoking, things seemed to have more life to it. I did need to quit though because it wasn't healthy and I do not want to destroy my brain. I'm a dual enrollment student, meaning I do college and high school at the same time. I've had straight A's all my life, including when I was smoking every day. I don't want to mess up what I have. But those DAMN CRAVINGS!!!

I did get in trouble for this at the start of Feb. My mom found out and talked to me and took what she thought was the last of my weed. It wasn't. I gave her one out of my five carts I had at the time. She trusted me, and I don't know why because she's a smart lady. I'm finally happy that I feel like I don't have anything to hide. 

To sum up, my main issue now is that I crave it all the time, I think about it all the time, and I want it all the time. If it wasn't for this virus, I would have already hit up my friend for some more. I hope I can stay strong. I want this, but why the fuck does it have to be so hard?

I've had a problem with weed for a little while. I remember when I first discovered it, and it was exciting and being high was absolutely crazy (remember those first times being high? It'll never be like that again!) and it was great. I did it in secret from my parents, who would be heartbroken if they found out I smoked it, so as much as I fucking loved getting high, I didn't do it often. 

But then I moved away for college, and I could smoke whenever I wanted! I fell in with a stoner friend, and I would smoke along with them. I'm a science major, and I knew that damaging my brain is not ideal for the type of academic work I want to get into, but I was always able to justify it as ""well I only smoke when I hang out with my friends."" But then I started hanging out with her every other night. As much as I genuinely love her and miss her, looking back, it eventually became the case where it was less about the friend and more about the smoking. 

Eventually, she moved away to go travelling for a few years. She's in Spain just now (don't worry, she's okay). I thought maybe that I'd smoke less, but I started smoking on my own now. I'd justify it as only smoking during the evening to get me to sleep, but I'd start smoking at 8pm and smoke heavily and constantly until about 5am. That's not smoking in the evening, that's binge smoking for 9 straight hours.

Quite quickly I realised it was a problem, but by this point I couldn't stop. Every single score bag was my ""last one"", I'd get about 2 grams, smoke it all within a day or two, have a day sober and motivated to stop, then go through a struggle where I had cravings so bad that I ended up giving some arbitrary date or reason to stop smoking to reassure myself that, actually, this NEXT one was the last one. 

This went on for about a year and a half. I've been lurking here for pretty much that entire time, never posting due to a deep shame I have surrounding the whole issue. Well, as much as this account is a throwaway, today I'm actually holding myself accountable. 

I have come back home to my parents' because of the pandemic. My dumb addicted ass thought it would be good to make edibles for my time here (I'd never risk them smelling the smoke), so I've only been sober since I ran out of that. But here I am on day 18.

The different environment has been great for cravings, because apart from anything else, I just can't get a hold of weed, and even if I did, I couldn't smoke it. The fact that it's not an option really really helps. But I keep getting into a mindset of ""I can't wait til this is all over and I can have a joint.""

I haven't told anyone how bad it's gotten. My close friends and girlfriend think I smoke once in a blue moon. Hell, I'm playing it off pretty well, I'm doing really well in uni and I feel like I'm getting a good degree. But since stopping I've noticed that I struggle to keep a constant flow in a sentence when I speak... I always trail off somewhere or have to take a moment to remember what I was talking about. My short term memory is absolutely shit, I'll ask my parents if they want a cup of tea, go to the kitchen, and completely forget what they said and have to ask them again. This sort of shit does NOT bode well for my career if I keep using. 

I guess I'm just scared that once this pandemic is over I'm just gonna go back to my flat and my dumb addicted brain is gonna remember my dealer's number and is gonna be able to justify getting ""that last score bag."" In moments of clarity, I know that that's gonna just take me back to where I left off with my addiction and the weeks of isolation and sobriety that I could have so effectively used as a detox period will be wasted. I really don't want to do what I was doing for any longer, because I'm just gonna fry my brain and disappoint everyone who, at this point, fully expect me to become an academic. I don't want to go back, but I know how I am with this substance and I know that as soon as I have the free will to, I'm going to desperately want to buy some weed again.

Before that I had never touched a drug or alcohol. It would be the start of my rabbit hole into madness.

When I first started smoking it was still illegal in my country and it was all part of the thrill of it. It was a rush going out with friends and smoking. It started to go downhill was when I started to smoke every day. I would always smoke and I was getting more and more anti social. I would just smoke with friends and just not talk and be lost in my own head. My friends were becoming distant and I was working all the time. It started getting worse because I couldn't go a few hours without smoking. So I decided to start smoking at work.

After smoking all the time I started developing panic attacks and weird thinking. This was my developing mental illness starting to become noticable to my immediate family. I was taken for a pysch evaluation and was diagnosed with pychosis. This was brushed off by me because I had become a conspiracy theorist. So I was distrustful of authority. Non the less I was prescribed antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. I took my meds the first night and slept for 14 hours straight. The meds I was taking was a med called olanzapine. I started smoking weed and taking the benzodiazepines too, at the same time. It was after this that I was kicked out of my house by family. I went to live with a friend. 

After I had moved in with my friend I quit taking my meds. But at the time I was still smoking regularly. One month later I was losing alot of weight and not eating right. I started to my experimental phase with psychedelic compounds. First was mushrooms. It was weird my trips were not good. After two months I moved back in with family and had to take meds again.

I then quit my meds and they started to stack up and I was kicked out again. I then moved in with a coworker. I was still smoking weed. Moving in with the coworker got me really interested with acid. So after being fascinated with it I got some. I then proceeded to trip every week and my mental health deteriorated tremendously. I was admitted into the pysch ward in June 2015 and have never been the same since. I had a full nervous breakdown and was diagnosed with concurrent disorders of 
Schizo affective 
Major depressive disorder 
General anxiety disorder 
Pychosis not yet defined .
I was in then released a month later and moved into a group home. I have been on disability since and have recovered tremendously. 

I still want to smoke weed but I know that it's bad because it now is like a acid trip everytime.
I have also developed a nicotine dependence because of having to stop weed.

Smoothies and shakes are amazing. You can so easily get a nice fill and some much needed nutrition which will help build appetite and give you the energy you need to fight this. I can almost always manage to chug shit down, it's the chewing part that fucks with me.

I got a bunch of fruit that I cut up and put in the freezer so it takes a minute tops to prepare some, or you can even make a batch and have it ready in the fridge. Its so damn good, and you will be happy just for doing something healthy, which can easily have both a snowballing and compounding effect.

I remember being so drawn to the idea of getting high, that I would crave drugs without ever having tried a cigarette or even coffee. When the opportunity to try it arose, I immediately did. Smoked almost every day since then. I'm on day 4 now (my most has been something like 12 days in the past 12 years...) and I feel like a 15 year old again. Like I've been living life in full zombie mode. I've been to college, had girlfriends, made music, lots of friends... And it really feels like it was just a dream. 12 years of fake memories, almost. I don't know who the fuck I am. If I smoked now, I would instantly feel great again... until the guilt and paranoid thoughts came back. Its always the same cycle.

I've been in voluntary isolation for almost a month now. In this period, I've spent about 150€ just smoking alone, trying to run away from the thoughts that I've been suppressing for so long. Isolation is, obviously, bringing them all back with twice the strength, and being back in my hometown, in my mom's house (lots of painful memories here, from a depressing adolescence, to my father's death...), is definitely making a dent in my mental health. I've had clinical depression for years. I was slowly but surely getting my life together, despite the weed usage. I can't explain how hard it was for me to go from waking up at 3pm everyday to get high to actually get a job, invest in relationships and be more active, in general. It is all going downhill again. There is no reason to wake up. I don't work anymore, don't study, the future of the world is dark and all my previous dreams have been thoroughly shattered. I am getting drunk by my own. Yesterday I drank 3 liters of beer and some wine, just so I wouldn't think about weed.

Like I craved weed before even trying it, now I crave the sweet release of death. Or something else that gets me out of where I am mentally right now. Guess drugs are what kept me from killing myself until now.

(No, I'm not going to do anything stupid. Just had to vent. I am really suffering right now, and this community is amazing. Even if I don't get any replies, I know someone will identify with this, and sometimes that helps both parties)

I'm very new to this subreddit but yesterday I had a major event that made me decide to quit weed once and for good so I wanted to share my story

*Heres some background:*
I'm 19 years old and my biological mother who I don't have contact with was most likely schizophrenic or bipolar. She also was a very heavy user of hard drugs. Luckily. when I was born and growing up, I showed no sign of mental illness. However, that doesnt mean I don't have that addictive trait and susceptibility inherited from her. (I'm also incredibly lightweight and sensitive to everything, even medicine.)
When I went off to college as a freshman past fall, I realized very quickly that *everyone* there smoked weed. In my house, it was almost all the time. I got into it but still wasn't completely loving it all the time. Around Thanksgiving, I decided to buy my own wax pen from a friend. I used the little bit that was left of the Sativa cart and I bought a full Hybrid.

Ever since I got home about 3 or 4 weeks ago from school, I've been smoking every single day, not being able to quit and I've gone through 75% percent of that cart.
Last night, I was hanging out with friends and I drank a bit and smoked a lot for a long time amd the next morning I was fine. I took a bit of allergy medicine and I started to get anxious( from taking the allergy medicine I think.) Then, I started to feel like I wasn't in reality anymore and I had lost who I was. I was completely scared and confused and ended up just wandering around crying and screaming. I think I had an episode of dissociation or something but I felt like I was high again. I decided that **I don't like being ungrounded from reality.** And even though weed makes me feel good. I'm scared that with my predisposition for mental illness, continuing to smoke will make things worse. I have too much to lose and too many people I love dearly to fuck anything up right now. It would be selfish.

So I decided that I'm going to quit as of today and take better care of myself every day from now on.

Most heavily 21-27. And almost all day everyday 24-27. I am on day 5 and honestly struggling. 

I feel like this withdrawal period has shown me how truly addictive and strong weed is these days. I quit once before and never remembered feeling quite like this. I am now starting to wonder if my anxiety was exacerbated by the weed all these years. Without the weed though I am struggling to get ahold of my anxiety, esp with everything going on in the world. 

The symptoms that I’ve had are, nausea (mostly in the morning), diarrhea, face tingles and sweating (especially my hands & feet). I have been able to sleep thankfully but have had vivid dreams and actually remember them?! I even had a dream last night that I relapsed with my cousin...I was so grateful when I woke up and realized that it was a dream. I do not want to go back. The sweating comes and goes but man is it tough. I’ve lost 13 pounds since Thursday and I’ve been forcing myself to stay hydrated and eat 3 small meals per day full of veggies, fruit, protein and carbs. 

I know these are all symptoms of my body expelling the toxins but honestly didn’t think I’d still feel like shit 5 days in. I feel like I should be starting to feel better now but can’t tell really how I am feeling with the anxiety. I’ve tried some meditation which helps for a few minutes but I just feel overall uneasy. 

I’ve read pages and pages in this thread and man does it help and I know this is what it looks like for my body to heal. I never realized how hard I was being on my body, this time has made me realize truly how much of an effect marijuana took on my entire system. I crave it more in the sense of, man I want to feel better and miss the social side of it but don’t feel that I have cravings for it. I don’t know if I was addicted. I gave up alcohol in June 2019 due to migraines and I definitely ramped up my usage of weed after that. Was I addicted? Perhaps. But I also decided to quit cold turkey. Maybe that was also partly a mistake. I am really hoping this gets better. I don’t know how many more days I can handle this. I know I will not give into smoking because I cannot start this withdrawal over again but with all of the medical issues in the world I also know that I can’t just go to a doctor or hospital if the symptoms become too much.

After a \~200 day highatus, I once again submerged myself in the green depths of the marijuana plant. This was just before Christmas, and iv been smoking a lot up to present.  And yes, it was great. For the most part i wasn't experiencing any anxiety and was controlling my food intake. I was smoking but also keeping up with my college work. I even managed to regulate my usage to some degree, although I would go for long stretches of smoking every night. 

A few nights back, I was smoking with a friend, having a great night. However, the last jay sent me a little bit over the edge. Made me feel quite nauseous. The next day I was physically ill and very down. Reminded me of previous dark times of my life. It was hard to deal with, because I was feeling so good up to that day. I got a great sleep that night and I woke up reborn. I was full of life in the morning. I tried to listen to my inner voice, because I felt something  trying to tell me something, trying to guide me down some path. 

So this time round, I'm not going to over analyse my relationship with weed. I'm not going to worry about the temptation of weed,  or the setbacks, the challenges and the confusion it brings. I'm only going to listen to my inner voice, and let that be the sole guide to my path. I believe the more I listen, the stronger it will get. Therefore, that's the only thing i should concern myself with.

About 10 minutes after setting off i notice a police car behind me and they turned theyre lights on signalling to pull over. I absolutely shit my pants as one officer came to my window and told me to join them in the police car, so i get in the back of the car and they ask me what im doing out on the roads so late during the quarantine and i tell them the truth and say i was hanging out with a friend, they understand and tell me im not the only one. I thought everything was cool until one officer asks if ive been smoking cannabis as they could smell it on me. They end up testing me and searching my car find the weed and i tested positive even though it had been a few hours since id smoked. 

Fast forward to them taking a blood test and locking me in a cell overnight and im now facing a posession and drug driving charge and all i could think about was how stupid i was and all i needed to do was stay at home, so i made the decision to quit after smoking for about 7 years rarely missing a day. Im probably going to have to go to court and probably get banned from driving and even if i dont get banned my insurance will be too expensive anyway. 

Honestly its been a weird experience and i just found this sub and its nice to know im not alone in this journey, I still kind of want to smoke but my brain is telling me its not worth it so in a way im kinda glad it happened like this, otherwise i know i would have fallen back into smoking by now.

I smoked for over ten years. That’s six figures. Up in smoke.

I remember it being difficult and collapsing on top of myself about when and why I would stop. Things are different now. I have made so many positive changes in my life that helped me respond to my inner voice that wanted me to find meaningful work. At the time i was in a job I hated and I was smoking to get more done at night bc it makes me creative and stimulated. I quit bc I knew I didn't want to have to depend on something to get through the day. I took some time off and weed became an even bigger part of my life as I blew through all the boundaries I used to have. I used to think I had a problem with weed when I couldn't hold myself back from smoking 1x/night every day of the week. In the last year I let it get so bad. My throat hurts so much. After the first inhale that makes me feel wonderful and tingly and numb to pain, i keep smoking to cover up more feelings that appear during the day and everything gets swirly and i tell myself these stories about what i do / dont do when im high. what im thinking / not thinking bc im high. and it makes me feel like im going crazy. im so ashamed that i let it get this bad. im so nervous for living without it. everything has felt so fucked for so long i am hopeful this will help me feel more in control of my life, more proud of who i am. but what if it doesnt? this will probably be my first of many posts. thanks for listening.",2,0

I am actually really excited to find this community, I was directed here from a recent r/Trees post. In short I’ve started to feel more and more lately that weed wasn’t hitting the same way it used to, and for every upside there was a downside. I am coming to a close in my senior year as a college student hopefully getting my degree in May and I feel like I need to get my life together and quit dicking around and getting high. I’ve taken a few tolerance breaks recently and I honestly feel way happier, less cloudy, and far more focused on what needs to be done. Being high all the time I am constantly missing deadlines and feeling like I have so much to do looming over my head. Also I may need to pass drug tests in the coming months for new jobs wherever I end up. So I’ve decided to take a long term break and I’m hoping this community will be able to offer some help in that matter. I’m gonna smoke the last of my weed tonight or tomorrow with a friend and then call it quits for the foreseeable future. I’m hoping i have the will to do it, but I just wanted to be able to share with someone who may understand me because my friends certainly don’t. Thanks :)",3,0

Thats what weed was for me. I used that shit to ignore everything. Picked up a nicotine addiction  and I didnt gaf because being high let me be content with whatever I was doing, even if I was doing Nothing.

I’ve been smoking weed everyday for more than a decade. It started out as a crutch to get to know people - I rode that “girl who can roll and handle the smoke” attitude for years. I loved it, both the stigma and the way I felt. About 4 years ago I was in and got out of an abusive relationship (and a whoooole lot of other drugs), and weed became my best friend. I isolated myself, lost contact with most of my friends, and felt like I couldn’t make it through the day without smoking.

It got to the point where I would smoke 3-4 bowls before work, and about 10-15 or more after work. It was the only thing I looked forward to. I was constantly in a haze, I never got anything done, barely had sex with my (amazing) SO, my anxiety went through the roof, and just overall felt like a failure at anything and everything. A big portion of this is my damn clinical depression, but I feel weed exasperated it. 

I don’t think that marijuana itself is bad, at all - in fact quite the opposite. It has so many wonderful capabilities for a laundry list of issues, but I’ve realized that any positive outcome it had for me is gone. 

On March 5 I decided to quit for a month, just to see if I could do it (thinking about quitting for good just seemed too much, and I’ve heard that for making changes to bad habits it’s important to take it a step at a time and make reachable goals). I made it 2 weeks, then broke down. I’m not smoking anywhere near what I used to, but when I was sober I felt so much more motivated. I did more hobbies I love, worked out a bit, and could actually get out of bed in the morning without hitting snooze for over an hour. 

I’m disappointed with myself, mostly because of how easy it is for me to make excuses. Yesterday I decided to try sobriety yet again, and then I found this sub today. Seeing all the successes of fellow redditors has inspired me to say fuck it, I’m DONE. Not a month, not “sober unless I’m on vacation,” I’m just giving it up for good. I’m giving the rest of my weed to my friend tomorrow. I’m scared, but I was able to stop my daily habit once before, so I know I can do it again.

Due to COVID-19, I have not touched weed for over 3 weeks now and honestly I’ve started see changes in my mentality and emotions.
I’m a college student and at school I live with two of my friends from high school, for the sake of anonymity I’m going to refer to them as A and B. This is the fourth semester that I have been living with them, and for the first three semesters, we could be put into the “stoner” category. Roomie A  and I have always had a solid relationship, as he is a very open person and even tho I’m very introverted, we see eye to eye on a lot and try to think things through (had a lot of good high epiphanies but I digress). Roomie B is the exact opposite of that - lacks emotional empathy and thinks he’s superior to everyone in whatever he does. I’ve had a roller coaster of a “friendship” with him.
I learned how to roll pretty quick into our first semester and eventually I was flexing multiple joints a night for us to smoke. Eventually it got to the point where Roomie B would only talk to me if he needed something - to rip my juul or ask me to spark/flex for him. Being a non confrontational person, I agreed most of the time to avoid conflict and his passive aggressive remarks. Fast forward a year or so, roomie A suddenly quits cold turkey. He buries himself into religion and begins to better himself in many aspects and honestly I was so happy for him. Meanwhile roomie B still asks me to roll for him, uses my glass pieces without cleaning etc (doesn’t help clean in general). So before my school closed it’s campus, I had been dealing with the constant pestering of roomie B for my weed stuff, depression which was snowballing, and just a lot of negativity on my plate.
I used weed to escape that reality, but when I would sober up, reality would hit me HARD. I hated it. I hated myself. I wanted to be alone but that just wasn’t possible in my situation. I lost motivation and lost many of my previous interests. To simply put it, i was drowning in a pool of toxicity that I had no idea how to get out of and without roomie A talking to me I really think I would’ve gone insane.

If you’re still reading, thank you - you’re halfway through my narrative.

I quit weed about 3 weeks ago because I had to come back to my parents’ home due to COVID-19. I had never been sober for more than 48 hours in probably 2.5 years before that and the withdrawals hit me hard. For about a week/week and half I would wake up multiple times a night drenched in cold sweat. It didn’t matter how warm my room was, how many blankets I had on etc. My shirt felt as if I had just jumped into a pool. I couldn’t fall asleep at night and it would take me probably 2/3 hours of laying still to actually fall asleep as I was wishing to take a bong rip or something - anything to avoid and distract me from the overthinking I do in the darkness. I had no appetite and my thoughts were just muddy. I had a poor memory and could not learn very well as I was just not interested in anything. However after that initial week or so, things started to get better. I started to fall asleep within 10-15 minutes and at an earlier time. My appetite was returning, and for the first time in forever I was interested in something - music. I’ve always wanted to learn to make music on my computer, yet could never get myself to learn as every time I opened up FL Studios my high ass brain did not fathom how the software worked. However, I can say now that I’m genuinely excited to learn and teach myself - something that would have never been possible if I were still high.

So in conclusion (congrats to everyone who is still here😂) weed has been the causation of more problems than I would like to admit, but so far so good. 4 years ago I don’t think I could have imagined myself in this situation, but honestly through the shitshow that I’ve experienced the past 2 years, I’ve learned a lot about myself and others and I know i will not be going back to my old habits. I can see why roomie A was so transformed and re-motivated to be a better person",11,2

I’ve tried to quit several times. All filled with optimism and excitement about the next stage in my life and the BAM I’m back ‘treating myself’ to a ‘little’ spliff. I want to quit for good and look back at this stage with smugness!

I’ve also had a fascinating experience with breathwork and natural dopamine releases - I love being clear headed! I love meditating. So I’m doing more of that, and less smoking.

I’m 35 and have been a daily pot smoker for the past 15 years. I smoked, on average, 4-8 small joints a day. Once a year I took February off from smoking just to prove to myself that I could. That I wasn’t “truly” addicted. Every February I would complain about missing it the whole month, as soon as March hit I was back to smoking every day. 
Last year, about 50% of the time I smoked, it would be very unpleasant. I would smoke my normal amount of a normal mid level THC hybrid strain and I would get crippling nausea and anxiety. Still knowing there was a good chance that smoking would make me feel awful, I continued to do it daily. That’s when it hit me that I really did have a problem. Who willingly continues to do something that makes them feel like shit half the time? An addict, that’s who. 
So I quit. I was having a surgery last month and decided that the night before surgery was my last joint. I still have a 1/4 and rolling papers but have had no desire to use them. My Fiancé still smokes using his volcano vaporizer and it doesn’t bother me. 
The only thing that I’m really struggling with is sleep. Normally I’m out like a light as soon as my head hits the pillow. Even with my yearly dry February, I was still able to sleep fine. I feel like it’s a mixture of not smoking AND not working due to the shelter in place. I’m still exercising every day and trying to stay active in my home but come bed time I just toss and turn. When I do fall asleep, I wake up several times through out the night.

Also I've always been worried that one of my friends or family would find this post and I'd be embarrassed about it. Sorry for my gramma errors and sentence structure errors in advance (english is my 2nd language). Let me start my story.

So I'm your average 22 years old guy who is about to finish his university journey at an average university in the UK. I've started smoking weed at the age of 16 with my best friend. He introduced me to it and we used to smoke very occasionally. I smoked maybe once or twice back then. It all changed when I started doing A levels, especially in the 2nd year of them. That's when I started abusing weed. It started with me only going for 2 lessons in the morning and instead of going to the rest of my classes I would just go home pick up a cheeky 20 bag order domino's and just live my best life until my mum comes back home from work and I would be pretending to be asleep so she doesn't realise that I've been smoking even though I knew that she knew because why else would I always be asleep when she comes back home from work? I would have many arguments with her about it because she knew that I smoked a lot but back then I just didn't give a fuck about what she thought and I would just continue smoking. It kinda gave me that feeling that everything is and will be okay when I'm high. My problems would just disappear as soon as I smoked a joint or hit a bong. This behaviour of mine continued until it would be close before my exams and I knew that I had to revise for them. Then I would try to cram the entire year of studying in 2-3 weeks and usually would end up getting average grades (got BBC in my A levels) but I knew that if I just revised properly without smoking my grades would be so much better. Ended up getting into an average university (top 50) with my grades and doing economics and when I got here that'ts when things started to get bad. I met a lot of great friends that were stoners as well and we would just pick up and smoke every single day. I would literally be high 24/7 smoking a 8th a day and just having a great time. However I always knew when it's close to the exam season I would have to stop so I can still pull off decent grades. Whenever that happened I would always be thinking ""I really wish I stopped smoking weed sooner because I would of saved so much more money and could of got much better grades if I started revising earlier. I somehow managed to pass 1st year of uni and said to myself that I would never smoke nowhere near as much in a 2nd year as this year would actually count toward my overall grade. 

Long story short in a 2nd year I ended up smoking even more of the boredom even though I knew I had to revise and to also escape my problems because whenever I felt very stressed all I had to do was smoke a joint and it would make me feel better until the next morning where I would just get stressed again and would end up picking up again. I have wasted so much money, time and feel like damaged my brain so much especially because I would be doing bongs with baccy in them for like a year and a half. I literally didn't recognise myself anymore, ended up barely talking to my mum, my housemates, fked up my relationship with my girlfriend. I knew that I was doing bad but all I would think about is that I want to smoke some weed. I lived in that bubble for solid 2-3 years being ""semi-productive stoner"" but I knew that this lifestyle wasn't good in the long run. Something clicked in my head in a second term of my 2nd year as I smoked so much that it wouldn't get me high anymore. I would need to do 2-3 bongs or smoke 2-3 joints to get even mildly high. I knew that weed took over my life completely but I didn't want it to ruin me as I have a chance of a lifetime to get a good degree and a good job afterwards. Therefore I have stopped smoking cold turkey and started to turn my life around as my finals were starting in a month and a half and I had to catch up on 100+ lectures with 50+ slides each. I spoke to student support officer and she told me that it is not possible to retake the 2nd year even if you got 3:2 or 2:2. This is when my whole life went upside down as I always had something to lean back on. What I mean is that even if I failed my exams I knew that I could retake it and everything would be fine but this time no retakes were possible unless you fully fail a year and even then it will all be capped. So I quit weed cold turkey for 80 days and was revising all this time so I can get good grades. This is when I started getting proper bad withdrawals. Sweating all night, panic attacks 24/7 thinking that my life is falling apart because I can't understand a lecture and I have to understand it so I can do well. Sleepless nights, getting very irritated at everyone, breaking down at least 2-3 times a day and all such things. It was the worst time of my life, I've lost all my confidence that I always had but I knew I had to get through it if I still wanted to do something of myself. So I somehow managed to hack those exams pull off that 2:1 and I went straight back into smoking thinking that it wouldn't be the same this time.

&#x200B;

I would end up smoking so much again over the summer holidays but said to myself I wouldn't smoke nowhere near as much in a 3rd year as it is a final year and it will be even harder. I definitely ended up smoking way less, I would make myself a promise that I would only smoke once a week and it worked for like 2 months but then I just went back to those binges where I would smoke every day for like 10 days and then stop for a like a week and horrible withdrawals would come back. Right now I haven't smoke for the past 6 weeks as I've got so many more exams this year and I know this is my last chance to do well in them. Currently I'm doing okay but instead of smoking weed I feel like I'm replacing it with things that give me similar dopamine rush like alcohol and masturbation. I know I use it to escape doing revision because I've always been a lazy person that left everything for the last minute and then tried to do everything and would always promise myself that ""this is the last time I'm leaving everything last minute"". I've just been on a 3 day binge of drinking and masturbating and I feel so fucking guilty and I'm angry at myself because I should be revising for my finals but instead I just end up not smoking but doing things that give me similar effect to smoking. I really want to change and discipline myself but I really don't know how to. Also, it always worked for me to have a little cry and I would always feel better afterwards but recently since i stopped smoking I haven't been able to cry at all and I really want to just to get all of those emotions out but I can't. Which is why I'm trying something else by writing this post.

&#x200B;

I just want to stop escaping doing revision and end up drinking or masturbating because I know when my finals come I will hate myself for not doing enough revision right now and I will never forgive myself if I do that. I just don't know how to self-discipline myself, or to re-wire my brain so I can revise and not just think about different ways to escape doing revision. I'm so sick of myself doing it because I know if I keep being like I am I will hate myself for the of my life.

&#x200B;

I think that's all I wanted to say. Again I'm sorry guys for such a long rant and how badly it's all structured I've never been good at writing those kind of things but felt like I really had to.

I hope you are all doing well, not smoking and improving your life's as much as you can because I believe just because I've stopped smoking it doesn't mean that my life will all fall into right pieces. I still have to work really hard if I want something from life, just don't have the motivation to do it when I really need that motivation right now.

Thanks guys and have a good night

I get to be reliable for my friends and my obligations. I get to shower and brush myself instead of passing out in bed. Those are all things that I didn’t have by the end of my using.

I recently, almost a month ago now, went on a trip to visit some friends in Colorado. On the trip I was of course pressured into smoking weed cause.. when in Rome right? Should of listened to that inner voice..

I started smoking every night on that trip just to unwind with buddies and it was fun. I’m not gonna lie. I told myself as soon as I get home this is gonna stop and I’ll go back to quitting. I had 4 months quit time and I planned on continuing that.

Nope. I have gone FULL BLOWN back into smoking weed from the moment I wake up until I go to bed and has it been terrible? Truthfully, no, but I can feel the grips getting tighter and tighter again. Starting to not wanna hangout with friends, starting to slack on life, starting not take care of things that need to be taken care of. I see myself slipping far back down the rabbit hole and I don’t want any of you beautiful people to do that to yourself. Cause I already know right now this is gonna be hard to let go of again.

Granted we are going through this Pandemic right now so I haven’t been feeling as bad to smoke weed all day and just be inside. It’s what we are supposed to be doing, but the weed is grasping me again and I can’t let that happen.

I’ve dreamt a lot about him... very emotionally triggering dreams one would think, and yet everyday I’ve accepted our end more and more. I’ve obsessed over him less and less. Dreams help us process emotions and trauma because we get to experience these emotionally triggering events without actually getting triggered. Due to the lack of the anxiety inducing chemical while we sleep: noradrenaline. Dreaming can serve as almost like an overnight therapy session.

I've been smoking mostly hash since i was 16 years old (19 now), i would've prefered weed but it's expensive around here (Paris), and well i usually do it to kill boredom and put myself to sleep, but I realised smoking only brings you more boredom along with other problems. Running out of money, having to move in the city to get ocb's/hash, waking up completely fucked up, not having the energy to even clean my room, knowing my parents sometimes notice when i've been smoking..looking forward to smoke when i'm watching a movie with my family but realising i should be enjoying family time more.. all those things daily smokers come to realise when getting high isn't exciting or fun anymore.

I quit in january for 3 weeks straight, not even a puff, but started again thinking ""i don't have anything important to do these days"" but that's always the same trap. Fell back in it, noticed the same flaws creep again

I know this quarantine shit won't make it easier but i still smoke cigs so i guess it will be easier than quitting smoking period.

Two birds, One stone?

I've been studying psychology over the last year which is helping me a lot, I grew up with mentally ill parents which caused my childhood to be quite toxic to say the least. When you're a child, you don't understand that you're going through abuse or what abuse really is and how it'll be affecting you, you rarely question it; but I am now in my mid twenties and I'm having to have these painful conversation with myself about why I have used weed to numb my pain and what is it that I've been running away from for so long. I know now that the pain I've been unsuccessfully hiding from has been scary for me to face; but I can understand that it isn't the adult state within me but in fact my child state in 'fight or flight'. I've been using it as a coping mechanism because I never faced those demons or found my strengths growing up - only silently suffered and put up with it, whilst feeling something wasn't okay and that is where the self-doubt within me is rooted, from a child. 

But I'm not a child. I'm an adult and I'm aware that as an adult, I have to purposely and intentionally choose to delve into the logic side of my brain more so than not. Logic is telling me that I can quit, I wont die, the withdrawal symptoms will suck, it wont be easy, Mary will try and fuck me again but I will eventually be okay and I will grow and I will flourish and I will love who I am and I will pay dues to the child within me that didn't feel strong or aware enough at nine years old.

This being said, I have become very aware of my own toxic traits, ones of which I have picked up and taken on as my own. I have been researching private therapists for when the government give us the all clear so alongside quitting, I will have that crutial support that will help me tackle my past. I don't know if it was psychology that saved my life or my own thoughts and actions, but I truly feel that if you are using weed to numb your pain, before you try and quit, be fully sure about what demons you are preparing to open the doors for.",7,0

1092,2020-04-05 07:14:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fvc8jo/relapse/,relapse,"Hi all, 

After almost 8 months sober, I relapsed.   
Leading up to this happening, I found myself self-talking and convincing myself that getting back into smoking was okay, and that in fact I was going to be happier and have a better, more productive life. 

My buddy invited me over with no explicit indication that we'd smoke, but him being a regular smoker (and my old dealer), I assumed that the likelihood of it happening would be significant, and so it happened. 

After so long, my tolerance would obviously be very low, and something I failed to consider when I took up his offer - a dab.   
I did a small one, it tasted harsh but fruity - I coughed, drank some water and settled myself down into a conversation with my friend. It was around ten minutes later that I knew something was very wrong. 

The reason I quit weed in the first place was because I had an insanely frightening acid trip to where I was dissociating and losing grip on reality - I thought I'd lost my mind. The trip was going fine up until my buddy and I smoked a bowl after a two-week long tolerance break. After the bowl, reality broke and so did my brain. Long story short, I called an ambulance and was throwing up into a bag the whole journey to the hospital, then most embarrassingly wound down in the emergency room until my mother graciously came to take me home. 

After that I swore sobriety and was doing really well. I had lapsed a couple times with MDMA (administered 'therapeutically' for diagnosed PTSD) and some nutmeg recently as I have found myself craving a sense of 'relaxation', for whatever reason I can't put my finger on. 

So I have this dab and I start dissociating - hard. Whoever has dissociated before knows what this is like, but to those who haven't experienced it, it's like you're outside your body, watching as a spectator - but you're not even quite a spectator. You're not fully 'there', and with me, I snap in and out of my body. It's terrifying and uncontrollable, as if everything is fabricated and foreign. 

I had to text my girl to come get me, and thank god she did. She's had her own issues with substances and traumatic experiences to where she's experienced dissociation many times before. The most reassuring thing she said on our way home was that she knew exactly how I was feeling. I can't tell you how much of a relief it is to hear that and be understood in a state like that.

The next day I felt awful, hung over and apathetic. 

Which brings me to now, two days later. I can't figure out why even after these experiences, I still wish I could smoke. I know I am, and can recognise I'm an addict - but can anyone else relate to this feeling? 

I hope anyone else out there trying to heal right now is doing alright. It's really hard sometimes.",0,0
1093,2020-04-05 04:58:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fvau1h/too_young_for_this/,too young for this.,"The last couple years have shown a darker side of me that before all of this I even knew was in me, a manipulative, lying, drug user. In 2018 I was 14-15 and i started smoking weed, it wasn't long before it became a habit.  A few months down the track me and my buddy would sneak out of our perfect suburban houses and go to the park to smoke weed, Yes we snuck out of our houses at 12-4am at night to smoke. To begin this was mearly a weekly thing and we would smoke after school most days too. This soon became a everyday thing, new friends were made giving us new spots to go sesh. Sneaking out of my house I think was the issue, their were times I would get caught keep in mind my parents are nazi about weed. I would just attempt to lie my way out of every situation I got myself in. After awhile of this going on I think I became a professional liar getting my way out of any situation. Of course their were times where I couldnt string something together and I'd get an absolute whooping. 

Towards the end of 2018 me and my mate got into other drugs first it was that shitty cough syrip dxm which made me puke everywhere, then MDMA I fucking loved this shit the first time i did it, a week later i did it again, then the next week also. Keep in mind im still only 15 at this point. More and more constant lies to mum, when 2019 came along thats when shit really hit the fan. Dropping any drug we could get our hands on, school nights never stopped us. Halfway through 2019 me and my mate both moved schools, this senior college pretty much a uni school. At this point I had tried acid, shrooms, mdma, ketamine, xanax, dxm, codeine, coke. I really got into mdma I managed to throw that habit off, when I met my current girlfriend at the time at school. First time I properly spoke to her she was drunk and I was on acid. anywhoo she turned out to be very anti-drugs which I respect its been almost 7months with her and I have lied to her many times about my sobreity from drugs other than weed, at the moment it is eating me up inside. I candyflipped on acid and mdma 2 months into a relationship and never told her, I also did mdma at a festival which she knew about, wasnt happy tho.  I've been clean from all drugs besides weed for 3 months know.

Currently my main problem is weed, I bought a little dynavap weed vape thing awhile back and its helped me get high discreetly for the past 3-4 months, me and my girlfriend argue heaps and I would use this as a sort of escape, no body knows about it and I would try only smoke after hours so I didn't run into the parents high as fuck. a few months down the track and I bought clear eyes to help perfect my lying. I get high at any chance I can get, I feel numb. I dont feel excitement or find things interesting unless i'm high. Currently been off for 2 days and never felt so numb and depressed. My girlfriend still has no idea of my use, I feel terrible for lying. But I know I cant tell her.",0,0

I used to only ever smoke edibles didnt work. Stress at home and with money had led me to reconvince myself temporarily on 2 occasions and now tonight. I thought, at least im not using pcp, binge drinking, using benzos, massive amounts of mdma or psychedelics, opiates, etc etc. 

The first time I got anxious and felt remorseful and panicky

The second time was about a month later (so first before quarantine actually) and I didnt feel that bad, just did it the one night and threw out the other 50mg piece. 

This time I dont really feel bad at all, and i keep questioning if I really want to be sober from weed. 

Now, I admit smoking was a massive money waster and was the only real drug that I would scramble to get more of as soon as i was out, and would sacrifice gas food and free money for it regularly. 

What I know for sure is I am tired of feeling like a failure, a dissappointment to family, myself, being tired, lazy, unmotivated, and quite depressed. So the problem lies within my ability to allocate significant value on my current status of not being in an all day every day marijuana habit. Not dabbing grams a day of cheap house wax, sneaking to smoke before any occasion, oh dinner gotta smoke, oh leaving the house gotta smoke, uh oh im awake gotta smoke. 

Thinking of it that way, it sound more valuable to stay in that clearer and more at peace state of mind, however after enough time I eventually feel so disenfranchised with the daily monotony of my life (which is the real problem to be fixed) that I no longer care about that and decide to intake alcohol and or edible (for now) thc. Plus i know if I smoke daily ill get tolerant and crave harder drugs.


I guess what im saying is probably nothing surprising for us r/leaves 

but I am wanting is the feeling of satisfaction with daily life and the feeling of just not really wanting weed even if youre home alone with money on quarantine without any drug tests or repurcussions going on. 

Plus I've been having ""well ill grow just a little bit of psilocybe cubensis when im more financially stable and progressed in my life"", thoughts.

Bit of a struggle but managing,"Been smoking since Thanksgiving 2018, didn't really turn into a thing until April of last year. Became a daily thing over last summer and fall. Took a small break during winter but as soon as February hit I was back to smoking on the daily. Had a bad experience with acid and ket 3 weeks ago that spurred me to throw it all out. I told myself then that the weed I had left would be the last of it. I had just learned how to make carts.

Only thing was, I burnt the oil in my cart when decarbing it, added a little too much terps so it tasted like cancer, and my pen battery was broken so I literally snipped the ends off of a USB cable and used the power lines from there in a makeshift setup to vape the cart. 

It was last night that I was sitting on the ground, smoking the last dregs out of an awful tasting and cancerous cart, using literal fucking exposed wires out of my wall adapter and contorting it into weird shapes so I could hit it. Every single hit felt like cancer but I just wanted it so I could relax and go to sleep. 

I finished the cart, the smoke hung in the air for a good minute (should've been a sign) and I immediately got up and threw it all away.

Now I'm embarking on a 90 day no drugs challenge along with a 90 day keto and 90 day nofap. I know it sounds like a lot especially during the corona isolation but I think if I can manage to do this then I'll be unstoppable. I will have literally forced myself to give up weed, jerking off, and eating junk, 3 out of the 4 of my main addictions. After that I should be god-tier, wish me luck lads.

I really would love to smoke right now. I thought I 'beat' the habit after a year of being disciplined. Well I have returned back that habit.

I love weed. But damn I hate that it's so habit forming. Occasionally getting stoned is great but this every day thing is once again starting to rule over me. The cravings are as strong as ever. 

I'm trying to look at this as a lesson and not get down on myself. 

I guess I'm just writing this to get some thoughts out.

The appetite and insomnia gets better everyday. The first 2 weeks I lost 15lbs. I was irritated and every time I ate I had diarrhea almost immediately but it all gets better. I drank a lot of hot tea and cranberry juices. I took melatonin in the first 2 weeks before bed. At 33 days, I am slowly gaining my weight back and my stomach has settled down. 

Whenever I get frustrated with whatever life threw at me, like how my education got put on hold from Covid-19 or how my job cut basically all my hours. My instinct is to smoke like I have been doing for the last 11 years since I was 18. However, I didn’t cave and I continue to remind myself how smoking doesn’t fix any of those things in fact it would only make it worst. What helped me by far is to keep telling myself, smoking is a lack of self-loved, smoking is admitting you have given up and not willing to face your life’s challenges like an adult should. It’s about being honest with yourself that instead of winning the game of life, you chose to hide from it. 

Encouragements are very very important, find someone that believes in you and supports you but most important find that support within yourself. You are much stronger than you imagine. The weed tells you to stop being motivated and be content with being weak. Once you stop, you realize how it holds you back. Every time, my friends argue how harmless or how wonderful weed is, that is the absolute sign that they are addicted and they make all kinds of excuses for it. I can guarantee that they are not as happy as they appear to be if you look past the smoke. The happiest people I know are always free from any substances that holds them back. I don’t judge them because it’s easier to live life that way but it doesn’t mean it’s the most fulfilling. 

You can quit only if you are honest with yourself and have to courage to face the things you are running from. I hope to update ya’ll at 90 days.

Having significant trapped gas and burping episodes from smoking,"So over the past week I've been having really bad 'burping episodes' triggered when I smoke. They last about 3/4 hours in length and it's possibly the scariest experience I've ever had. I involuntarily burp and force gas out my throat/stomach and can't breathe in doing so. I've never felt closer to death than I have during these episodes. I was weed free for about 3 days, then got another one not related to smoking, so I'm in hospital getting it checked out now. 

It's probably smoking related, so this is seriously the wake up call I need to kick the habit. The past month or so, I've been craving getting high, and then as soon as I do, I get anxious and wish I wasn't high. It's only developed like this recently, and I've smoked weed and tobacco almost daily for about 8 years (I'm 27). 

Reading all the threads about mind fog etc is making me look forward to kicking or for good. Or at least for a good few months so I can fully reset. 

Still haven't found out what the underlying cause of the burping episodes is, but if anyone cares I'll update later.

I had quit for a year & mid January or beginning of February I decided to smoke weed again.
I moved out of state so the reason I was sober for that long was because I didn’t know anyone that had weed.

Leading up to smoking I was thinking about it a lot, I was looking around for any people that look like they smoke in my neighborhood, i started to look for plugs on Instagram and that’s how I found 5 connects so there was no way I wasn’t getting weed I had multiple people to get it from. 
(People flake) 

Anyways. I started off only at midnight when everyone was a sleep because at first I had to hide it from my family again. Then I discovered that I loved smoking in the mornings instead because I had the whole day ahead of me.

At first it made me soooo but sooo productive I think it was all mental and I think it was weeds way of luring me in again. Because now I’ve become lazy in only 2 months. Granted I still cleaned high every single day but I started to be in bed more, and lay down more, and eat ALOT ALOT, and yeah. I dropped everything for weed in those two months and probably spent 1,000 alone in one. 

Flash back to realizing I cannot go back to my old ways. I used to be addicted heavily 2 years back. I smoked for 4 years everyday straight. Multiple blunts a day. ( that was my only form of smoking) TERRIBLE.",2,0

I ran out this morning. My country is currently on covid19 lockdown and so I can’t get any more for at least three weeks. I’ve been saying “this is it” for months - probably years - and now I’m here. 

I’m really really scared of what it will be like but I’m sick of telling myself that I’m done with this life and smoking anyway. I hope this forced sober time will wake me up and I’ll be in a better, stronger position to stop buying and stop wasting my life.

I hated ""wasting"" my high by falling asleep so i made the switch. But with that, I think, came a change in my mental health, that I didn't notice until this past year. I have become more nervous in social situations (I'm already shy as it is, but it became more obvious), even more paranoid than I naturally was, and have a hard time creating and keeping platonic relationships (but that's a whole other can of worms that i need therapy for). I can't for sure say cannabis is to blame, but I believe if I stop smoking it can help me pinpoint why I have become this way, and in turn I can work on bettering myself.

I was never a daily smoker, it would come in waves. Sometimes I would partake once every other week, once every few days, other times I would smoke every day for a week and then stop for a while. So, to me, I wasn't addicted. Once I realized I was smoking to make regular activities like going to the movies alone or with friends (not telling them I was high), watching a show at home more fun. Or smoking because I had a shit day and wanted to relax, or because I was bored, I think that's when I realized I was doing it for the wrong reasons. If I replaced all those activites with alcohol, I would consider it a problem. I also ALWAYS smoked alone. Very rarely did I smoke with a friend.

This biggest shift in my attitude was when I met someone who told me their partner had experienced cannabis induced psychosis. I had already been feeling like cannabis has changed my mental state for the worst, especially with feeling paranoid to the max. And now that I've met someone who has first hand experience with cannabis induced psychosis, it felt a little more real, and scared me into quitting.

I quit in February and lasted 52 days before my first relapse. Before the relapse, it was the first time in my life I had physically craved smoking. I had a few dreams where I smoked and instantly felt guilty because I let myself down. To me, that solidified that I had a problem. Even if I was never a chronic 365 daily smoker, to me, it was a problem.

I can't blame COVID-19 self isolation for my relapse, because I made the choice. But the boredom was definitely a factor. The way I made sense of it was that if I only buy Indica edibles, then it won't be bad for my health. I'm using a product that won't make me more susceptible to COVID because I'm not smoking and it's an Indica so I won't feel paranoid. Not some crazy high percentage of Sativa. So, I went and bought, not one pack, but two packs of gummy edibles, because apparently my brain thought one pack of 5 wasn't enough. Which makes no sense because I know I can't handle edibles, I only eat 1/3 of each one at one time, so they will last me a long time.

For four days, I had edibles before bed and throughout the day I consistently used my thc oil dropper, just because I felt it made me calm. But with being at home all the time, I haven't been experiencing anxiety at all, so what was the point really. On the last night I had an edible before bed, and woke up in the middle of the night with the worst menstrual cramps of my life. So bad that I vomited twice, but when I had to get up to go to the bathroom to vomit I was still high (mind you, I only had 1/3 of a gummy) My body was trembling, my legs were shaking, I felt dizzy, it was terrible. It reminded me of an identical previous experience I had with edibles. So I honestly don't know if I puked from cramps, which has also happened in the past, or if I puked from the edible. Either way, I stopped consuming from that day forward, and now I'm back to being eight days sober, and I'm hoping I'll continue longer than before. My initial goal was 6 months, and then once past that goal, a year.



Tl;dr: Smoked a lot of Sativa and noticed I became more nervous in public and creating and keeping friendships. Felt way more paranoid than I naturally was and blamed the weed for it. Noticed I was smoking for the wrong reasons, personally. Decided to quit after meeting someone who's partner had cannabis induced psychosis. Lasted 52 days before I relapsed and made sense of the relapse because I would only eat edibles that were indica dominant so I wouldn't feel paranoid. Went on a 4 day ""*bender*"", and on the last day I puked twice while my whole body was trembling. Decided to quit after that situation and now I'm at 8 days sober. My initial goal was 6 months, and then once accomplished, a year.

How do you keep your brain occupied when that craving hits?

I want to preface this saying that I love my new self, and I love no longer smoking weed. It's great, I'm clear headed and more motivated, etc. etc.  I just moved back home because of the virus, and am doing fine as I'm already sort of a hermit, but would very much like to smoke with my younger brother, who is also home from school.  I'm not worried about the repercussions, I know I'll stop immediately at May (want to get a potential security clearance for a summer internship next year), I am unable to unless it's like midnight and my parents are asleep, and I don't plan on doing it every night, as I'm not the one buying the weed but my brother is.  My only worry is that I will be extremely let down that I have reached my 60th day and gone back in to smoke.  In the back of my head, though, I know this number is arbitrary and the true victory is being able to keep myself from smoking every day, when I did so for 3 years of my life.  I very much want to, but also acknowledge that it's not that important to me anymore so if the general advice is not to smoke again, I plan to take it.

Please give me some advice and try and look at it partially.  This is not stress related, not withdrawal related, non-addiction smoking.  It would really only be a few times this month I imagine.",2,1

Small breaks here and there but that’s it. I’m almost 21 years old. Today makes 1 month &25 days since I last got high. Good golly. I’m so happy i can finally say that. when I first quit. I would come on here and read the posts of people months clean and think I want to be like that. But I didn’t feel like I could truly take advice out of what they were saying because they were so far ahead. And I was there. At square one. I felt suffocated...I had to get angry with it. I would get cravings and my brain would try to tell me just one more time... but that never EVER. ends well and you know it. 


I would get angry at myself for letting me end up in this condition. I quit by just not smoking anymore. It’s so difficult not to give in and smoke sometimes. But it’s as easy as not picking up that joint and holding it to your lips and inhaling. If you can refrain from that super simple action, you’ve got it. I know you feel so lost and so deep in that hole. I want to offer hope. I felt so hopeless as a human being before I quit. I got bad anxiety and depression waves from paws but you just have to let yourself feel those emotions. Your brain is under construction. A deep pressure washing from all the gunk you put in it. It’s being re wired. Let yourself feel the emotions. If you are depressed and don’t want to speak to anyone. Don’t. Lay inside and watch that soap opera for 13 hours straight. Just know it’s all part of the process. And when you’re laying there If you get the urge to smoke just drop in that floor and do as many push ups as you can or whatever exercise and use that crave as energy. 


I’m laying here today and cannot begin to explain how beyond thankful I am that I was finally ready to quit that. I was so lost. I lay here today unsure of who I am but just in these past few weeks The shitty relationships I’ve had with everyone in my family and life has slowly began to heal. I see light. I find joy in small things that I never began to think about in the past. I feel human again. I never thought anyone was truly happy. Everyday is like Christmas to me. Full of wonder and discovery. I am genuinely happy. I still have a ways to go but I finally have some self confidence. I finally see inspiration for my life. I just wanted to tell you that you all deserve this. You will get better. Those chains are going to fall off and you are going to grow and develop in ways you never ever thought possible. You will become so intrigued by things you were once completely blind to. You deserve this new life. 


If you have people in your life that are dragging you down. Keeping you from your best self. You won’t get far with them pulling and tugging on your chains. My best friend of so many years. My sister basically. We talk daily of literally everything. But she wasn’t ready to stop smoking and would tear me down for talking about it. Because she didn’t want to be bothered with that burden since she wasn’t ready. I had to just let her be off in that world. Until she’s ready to come back. I had to go off alone on this journey and free myself from those chains. You can do it. Download the grounded app.",7,0

I want too, but just feel diminished of will, any advice is greatly appreciated.

edit: I also have a pretty addictive personality and my families genetics are definitely strong in me in terms of that.

This coronavirus scare and a lockdown in my country has prevented me from scoring. Actually, I had a choice to stock up on weed beforehand but I chose not to score.

Over the past 8 months, I've had a really good spiritual awakening which has destroyed my depression and anxiety for good. I did smoke, but I gradually reduced it over a period of time. There was a short period sometime in Feb where I started smoking everyday and as soon as I finished the stash, I've stopped. I smoked last 3 weeks ago at my friends birthday.

So instead of having a joint after work to relax, I spend 45 minutes to an hour doing deep meditation. The high I get from that is incredible and feels so pure. I have been so much more productive, there is no fog in my head and I am able to truly feel joy instead of numbness from getting high on pot.

I've also added some exercise and healthy eating to this routine. Instead of smoking before bed, I read a book every night. I used to smoke and mindlessly browse my phone before that.

I'm trying to use this lockdown and quarantine to completely revamp my lifestyle and change my habits. I don't want to be the same person as I was before. I don't want to be addicted to cigarettes and weed and feel so disconnected from reality. Even though the world is going through this traumatic pandemic right now, I feel good for being sober and I feel good for pursuing my spiritual and intellectual goals.",64,6

So I’m a few hours sober and here is my experience. 

My last time smoking was 3pm 

By 5pm I kept looking for more weed and forgot that I smoked all of it, not only did I make a mess but I cried. 
The anxiety came down after I had support from my husband. 

I suggest telling someone close to you what you are going through so they can help you through some emotions withdrawal will cause. 

I’ve been feeling super emotional, don’t know if it’s my cycle or the withdrawals but considering every time I tried to quit I cried multiple times a day haha. 

Anyways it’s day zero, one and it’s been hard. I smoked on my “day one” because mornings are hard to get by but tomorrow I will be sober from the start. And part of me is scared and excited. 

A few hours sober I already feel clarity and a sense of hope come back into me. 

I cried 3 times so far today and I’m super clingy with family now that I don’t have weed to take all my time and attention

Lost my job 2 weeks ago, probably won't work for another 5 weeks at least thanks to COVID. Being home alone 24/7 sucks and I'm slipping into old habits: lots of netflix, junk food, naps. I don't really have anything to pull me out of it and I might as well be high for it.

but I'm not. and I'm so grateful. I know if I had just a little joint today, I might get a high out of it, but tomorrow and every day after I'd end up toking every couple hours, not getting any of the euphoric high, spend all day foggy and blazed, and end up anxious and regretful over the wasted money and possibility. I would think about it constantly, arguing back and forth in my head over whether or not it was OK, and I would obsess over tracking down a source in this pandemic. it would consume me.

life is so much simpler now, so much calmer. I'm doing pretty much the same useless shit I would do if I was high, and you know what, I'm fine with that. I still enjoy it sober. I'm not going to push myself to be productive, I lost someone to COVID, I lost my job to COVID, I'm just going to take a few weeks to grieve and be lazy and soak in the free time (thanks unemployment). When it's over, I'm going to hustle over-time, so I'm not worried about it. the plan right now is to chill and let this pass.

I'm grateful I went through those more difficult first 2 weeks when I had a job and a social life to distract me, and it's much easier now to maintain. if you're just starting, though, it's so worth it, no matter the timing, and don't feel bad if getting sober doesn't turn you into a productivity machine: that's OK, just being sober is worth it. even if you're just doing the same shit - at least you're saving money! your brain is healing, re-balancing, re-wiring. you're setting yourself up for success.

Today is my 2nd day sober after quitting weed again after almost 3 week binge smoking it. The last week of it I smoked the most pretty much from waking to sleep.  


How did I feel during this time?  


Disconnected, numb, relying on weed to feel good, sober moments were numb and foggy and pleasure rushed in as I smoked the joint.  
However, these are feel good chemicals, it's short term pleasure. This is facts because as soon as I finish that 1joint I must go to roll another and continue smoking to continue the rush of feel good chemicals.   


And now, 2 days sober. Today was not great. I slept badly, woke up with a bit of energy but once I got ready I just felt numb all day. I can't really say if I feel good or bad because I don't feel much at all but when I do feel anything it's generally sadness, stress, fatigue, anxiety.   


Overall today I was just very fatigued and really found it hard to work out. Very little motivation but managed to get on the bike. Very strange experience. Was very numb and strange to go down a hill fast. Usually I find it very fun, it was still fun but not like normal. When I got home I literally couldn't move for 5 minutes and I barely even cycled. My legs were hurting, it was hard to breathe. I genuinely felt I could've passed out nearing my house as I slowly cycled up the hill in pain.   


I also hadn't really been out like that for a while so seeing a lot of people walking outside wasn't overwhelming but did feel strange for some reason. I didn't feel my usual anxiety but my eyes were watering a lot which is a mixture of the cold air hitting my eyes + anxiety.  


I first smoked around 14 or 15 years old and am now 18. I've been through periods of using weed for long times and then stopping for a few months and the cycle continues again and again. I think I can handle having a joint or toke from someone but it's never just 1 time. I now truly know this from experience and can never smoke it again regardless of any circumstance. Generally the last few times I went sober after a few months I would randomly smoke weed as I never set the intention to truly never ingest it again but now it's set in stone. I'm fucking done with weed. Genuinely. Never. Again. Because it's never just one time.  


Now in ending this message I really want to try and focus on how I was before I ever smoked weed. I feel like weed definitely made me the anxious person I am today and for that I truly envy it however I have to now move on from it and accept it for what it is. Yes for some it's a medicine, but guess what? I'm not unwell. Infact smoking this makes me unwell. And now rather than disliking weed or hating it or envying it. I will simply respect it and respect myself enough to never tough it again.",6,0

After smoking weed with tobacco (spliffs) for around 4 years (near enough daily for the last two and a half) I’ve finally decided to quit (starting about a week ago) as well as quitting smoking. I’ve successfully quit smoking tobacco however I think I’m struggling with the withdrawals from weed. My anxiety is extremely high at the moment. I’ve dealt with anxiety in the past and pretty much cured it (as much as it can be cured) however now it’s worse than it ever has been. I’m extremely paranoid, being a little bit of a conspiracy theorist and never having trusted the government, thinking people might be following me or being undercover agents of some kind. I don’t believe these thoughts once I actually think about them and they absolutely terrify me but they do pop into my head. They’re more “questions” than beliefs however, most of them starting with “what if”, what if they’re an undercover agent? For example. I suffered from derealisation when quitting from smoking which and I got similar thoughts then, stuff like what if everything’s a simulation or what if nothing is real? This makes me thinks that it could just be my anxiety posing these scary questions based off of what I’m going through (having recently met a new friend who’s even more mistrusting of the government than I am and has been sharing various sources with me etc). These thoughts and feelings come in waves but they’re absolutely horrible. I haven’t been experiencing any hallucinations of any kind as far as I’ve noticed and over than these thoughts I’m functioning normally, still working and looking after myself. My cousin has schizophrenia, however, and so I’m worried about there being a higher chance of me getting it or this being the early stages of it as I’m 19 and male and so in the prime age to begin developing it. I feel silly though as when I asked my mum if I was right in remembering that my cousin has schizophrenia she said that it was apparently drug induced. I’ve completely cut out all drug use from my life including caffeine, weed and nicotine being the only drugs I’ve regularly done. 

I’m also very sleepy in the day when it comes towards the afternoon and feel flu like symptoms every now and then. 

Sorry if this is a bit of a clusterfuck to read, I’m very much venting at the moment as I can’t talk to my parents about my drug use or possible withdrawals and just writing this has made me feel considerably better. Has anyone else experienced these fears/symptoms? If I am developing schizophrenia I want to catch it early. I’m determined to stop all my drug use regardless. Anyone able to help or give me advice on how to stop this? Going to book a doctors appointment anyway just for a check up to try and make sure it’s nothing biological wrong with me.",7,0

I feel way more alert in my 'dream state' and I'm loving being able to access my dreams again.  This is probably my biggest motivation to quit for good this time.

I’m 28 years old and I have been a heavy pot smoker since I was 18. I’ve been depressed a few times (let’s say 4... all ranging from a week to 2 months) in my life and it always stems from isolating myself in my room, smoking all day and binge eating and binge watching movies, but I’ve always managed to get back out of it and get back to feeling not just normal but really freakin good. I always get myself out of it by exercising, eating very clean, back to work, healthy relationships, yoga and meditation and getting a lot of sunlight. 

This time is very different. Last month i fell into it again (it lasted about 3 weeks). After the 3 weeks i snapped out of it and got back to my normal healthy routine. 2 weeks went by and I seemed to be doing really well. I didn’t stop smoking but was just smoking a lot less, until 5 days ago happened. I smoked at night and my thoughts were uncontrollable. I thought i was going crazy and I was talking to myself all night long. It went on for about 4 hours and then i finally feel asleep (thank god). This has never happened to me before so I’m in bed freaking out and just going bat shit crazy. 

I have not touched weed since and I NEVER WILL TOUCH WEED AGAIN. I have no craving for it all. I have no cravings for it bc of how intense and how painful it has been for me these past 5 days. It fluctuates a lot but i have a ton of tension headaches (which idk if this is the right term but sharp pain near my temples) I’m thinking in my head a lot of the day uncontrollably, and my symptoms seem to match being dissociative/ psychosis. It’s a bit scary for me to be honest guys. I told my dad and he said go see a psychiatrist. Fuck that. I’m sorry i don’t believe in taking anti psychotic meds for my situation or for me i should say. I refuse to believe that i need to take these types of meds bc i put myself into this weed induced state of mind. I’m not saying everyone shouldn’t take it I’m just saying I won’t and I don’t believe in them for myself. 

I’m going to try everything in the world before i going to see a psychiatrist   Since we are all being honest here I’d rather commit suicide before taking anti depressants or antipsychotics. And i have no judgements to anyone that takes these meds but i just seen what they do to people and i would never (my mom is also a  pharmaceutical rep and sells these drugs so i know a lot about the side effects and about how they switch up drugs like candy and most people feel like non human when they are on them)

I am not suicidal at all i just want to say that but it’s just been so hard for me these past 5 days guys...Like so tough and I have a couple close friends that I’ve spoken to about this. One said to micro dose shrooms and the other said it will go away in time. I want to tell and talk everyone in my life about this but i feel ill be judged or just told to “go see a psychiatrist” and i believe that’s the last option here. 

So i have hope. I think this will go away one day just with being completely sober and goal oriented and doing all the normal things that i tend to do to stay fit and happy.  It’s just so real right now and I’m so scared right now.  

I don’t feel depressed at all. I’ve felt depression in my life and this is just different.  I actually love where i am at in life so that’s why it scares me. 

Anyway i think that’s it. Thank you so much for reading and getting through all the typos and mistakes lol 

Peace and love everyone. I hope everyone is trying to stay positive through this virus thing. It hasn’t effected my family or job or anything and i have no aniexty from it but i can only imagine what’s happening for people that live paycheck to paycheck. 

Any and all comments are so appreciated 🙏🏼",3,1

Then a friend posted an online smoke sesh. 

I used to hang out with a group of hippies and really enjoyed spending time with them. This friend was part of that group. People kind of drift in and out of that group. Our main restaurant to hang out at went under and everybody did their own thing. I ran into this friend from time to time but not for a year or so. 

So I stupidly bought a tube of three pre-rolls 1/2 gram each. 

I smoked the first one and then joined this group. Of course they were all high so nobody could use the technology properly. My friend was really high so I'm not sure if she recognized me. After five minutes I left the sesh. 

I got bizarrely paranoid. Thankfully getting up and getting active helped. Apologies to my downstairs neighbour for the pacing. :)

Smoked the rest of the tube last night. It just didn't feel good and wasn't worth the effort. 

I think it's a good thing I didn't really get much benefit from yesterday. Makes it really easy to pretend like it didn't happen and move on.",1,0
1164,2020-04-03 05:39:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fu5fiu/day_6/,Day 6,"I will update this post as the day progresses.

&#x200B;

**10:17**: So, if anyone has been following these posts, you'll know I had a health scare 2 days ago. I'm a seriously heavy user and quit cold turkey. I didn't post anything yesterday as I was focusing on getting back to my normal self. I'm finally feeling much better - still off but nowhere near as bad. An important message to all: Please keep up on your food intake when you quit. Loss of appetite & diarrhea are symptoms that heavy users experience when they quit cold turkey. The loss of appetite can be so bad, that you can only stomach a bite or two, and any more you'll feel like throwing up. Sometimes just chewing a bit of food can trigger a gag reflex. And because of the diarrhea, your gut is not absorbing the nutrients from whatever little food you are eating. I had all the above whilst also doing exercise at home. This is a recipe for a health disaster. Especially during this pandemic - you DO NOT want to go to hospital, or run the risk of paramedics turning you away from an ambulance during a health emergency because they are all busy with Covid19 patients (happened to me). Force down some smoothies or soups if you are struggling with solids. Just make sure you are eating throughout the day and at least 3 meals a day. It's really important because you might feel great or you might even enjoy the weight loss from eating so little, but it will manifest into something bad overnight if you don't eat properly. If you're finding it really difficult to eat at least 3 balanced meals a day, I really suggest tapering down guys. For example, if you usually wake and bake, cut out the wake and bake and leave it until the afternoon, then a little in the evening. Gradually reduce your intake to where you are only smoking at night. Then to the point where you only need a little bit at night. I've found when I do this, I can easily forget about smoking if I'm too tired at night. This helps your body adjust rather than shock your system. I feel more brain-fogged today than ever before but I think it's because of the past 2 days (stayed up for 40 hours in a high anxiety state dealing with paramedics and doctors and just trying to get my sugar level in check). I found an addiction website that stated ""tapering down just doesn't work"" and that cold turkey is the only way - which is the most harmful advice I think people could ever read. This statement is not taking into account the user's frequency of use, the potency of their marijuana, any prior health conditions, or their physical stature. There are just so many variables, there is no ""one size fits all"" method.

&#x200B;

**Anyways, on a GOOD NOTE, I pretty much don't have any cravings at this point. Cravings were way stronger in the beginning, but at this point, I feel used to not smoking :). I feel like I'm connecting more with my family (albeit with calls and messages due to quarantine), which is something I've always wanted. I'm usually in such a daze I can't even focus on messaging people back or even think about speaking on the phone. Also, my appetite is coming back. I'm craving meals and I'm eating more. Thinking about certain foods makes me so hungry now. Keep it up guys!**",7,3

I don't know if this is just the side effect or me starting to relapse into depression. from what I read these side effects should start wearing of but it's just getting worse.

Should I toss it all out, gift it to a stranger at the dispensary, gift it to a family member or friend?

Mostly, I can **FUCKING FOCUS**. 

Before, I could only paint for legit like 30 minutes and then my brain would get fried. To be honest painting is a higher order activity (in my head it is) and I could not last for after 30-45 minutes before my eyes would hurt, head would hurt, and my brain would tell me its too hard. I had so many unfinished paintings, written work, undone ideas, etc.

Now I can trust myself to finish a project even if I put it down. I have the desire and drive to get things done now. I can focus on a task for like, an hour (which is huge for me, guys!).

I can't believe I'm here. I'm like, *making* things again. And then taking breaks (like now!) and then getting back to them. 

For anyone struggling, just know that letting weed out of your life will free your mind up for so much more, for what you were put here to do. What everyone here is saying is true. It *is* a distraction. A powerful one, but you are stronger.

I’ve definitely explored the vast world of marijuana but it was around a year ago when I had noticed a shift in the way I acted every time THC would enter my bloodstream. Especially in social settings, I would become immersed in my own thoughts, forget about the present, and open the floodgates to overthinking/anxiety. I began questioning my own decisions and choice of words through conversations and sometimes immidiately regret what I say due to the reaction of other people. This led to my decline in participation in conversation all together when I would be high and try to rationalize my comments even though the conversational moment had drifted away. I had become so obsessed with trying to be right that I blinded myself with my own ego. Everything when to shit after I noticed my own hamartia but couldn’t tailor a root cause to it. Blatantly, I began ignoring and starting accepting, “This is who I am and this is how things will be.” Weed turned me into an introvert. 

Currently going through isolation during the COVID-19 crisis somewhere in California as times have become dull and grim through shelter in place. Days have become much shorter as sleep has been inversely affected as i’ve picked up a habit of sleeping around 3am and wakeup around 10am to only go back to sleep for 3-4 hours. I’ve been cutting myself short of meals ever since coming back home from university but at the same time one thing I left in school was the devils lettuce which had become a routine in my life. I was two weeks sober until yesterday I decided to buy a wax cartridge for the hell of it and lapsed into a state of depersonalization where I began questioning everything to the point of my existence all together. This is not the first time.  I’ve come to realization that marijuana will longer be apart of my life for however long need be (i’ve taken breaks spanning from few weeks to months). Let’s see how quitting all together plays out shall we? Any sort of feedback will help please & thanks! Hope the best for everyone reading this!!

I have been doing well. No smoking for 11 days although I did take some edibles to help with the insomnia. Zero cannabis in my system for over a week. 

Today my friend is advertising an online sesh at 4:20 (of course). These aren't people I would hang out with and smoke. More like a subset of a larger group of friends and when we would show up to events 80% of us would be high. We usually smoked in smaller groups before these events.   


I crave social interaction. I am so tempted to run to a legal store and buy just one joint. 

What should I do?",1,0

I have to constantly remind myself that I only wanted to smoke when I was sober and as soon as I was high I wanted to be sober again. It got to a point where I thought I was dealing with my anxiety, loneliness and shyness by smoking but the truth was that weed was the cause of those things. I can't imagine being in the current quarantine situation with my anxiety as bad as it was.

I'm nowhere near repairing the damage but this feels like a big step in the right direction. Don't kid yourself into thinking it will solve all your problems.

I've tried quitting a few times before but always relapsed due to thinking 'yes now I can handle it'. I've since realised this and gotten over that thought process. Ive been pot free since 11-15 days (I dont exactly remember when I first stopped, but now I keep track) and things are going great. I feel more like a human I feel more emotions and it feels like my depression is finally started to lose its grip. However there's something that's been bugging me and I could really use some help

I'm extremely lethargic, I sleep around 10 hours a day and I can sleep more if I want. I'm not exactly fresh even when I wake up, I only feel fresh at night and lethargic in the morning so I usually sleep in the morning till afternoon or evening. I lift weights once every two days too to help with stability.

Another thing I've noticed is my legs are restless, I keep shaking them. Another thing is I get random 'tremors' in my legs arms and neck, like twitches that cause actual but very very small movement (not just within the muscle).

I'd appreciate any thoughts or if someone has been experiencing the same thing.",5,0

I'm the guy who [locked his weed in the shed](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fpxnxx/last_night_i_took_an_edible_that_im_not_sure/), here with an update.

Symptoms:

Unlike previous attempts, I don't have the usual insomnia and loss of appetite, which is a huge relief. Cravings have been manageable, starting with a little tingle in my head, followed by a brief moment of despair that I'll never be able to scratch that itch again, but it passes pretty quickly. The symptoms I do have are night sweats, and a pervasive sense of boredom and shortened attention span; which I guess is what people are referring to as the brain fog. 

FAQ:

My girlfriend quit at the same time as me, though she was never as heavy a smoker. She's had some insomnia, with scattered bouts of irritability throughout the day, but we're in this together so it hasn't caused any tension. Giving her the key was a bit of hyperbole. It did happen, but the key has been accessible to us both this whole time, so it's not like she's keeping it from me. And yes, all the stuff is still in the shed. Despite multiple warnings I have not disposed of it, and have promised my weed and other paraphernalia to various friends after this virus thing blows over.

I did have a small stash and one-hitter hidden in the woods behind my work, that I would smoke when I went on my walks. I went ahead and tossed all of that in the lake. Good riddance.

Future:

We both signed up for a game jam this weekend, with her on art and me on programming, mostly to keep us busy so we can't think about it. We've never done anything like this before, so we're pretty excited to learn the theme and start creating!

Reflections:

I'd like to share a thought that has been keeping me going: Happiness doesn't come from trying to feel good all the time.

That's all for now. I'll try to update again on day 30, for accountability's sake. Good luck on your journeys everyone!",10,1

I’ve smoked it daily for around 5 years and I’ve reached a point where I have to admit to myself it’s unhealthy: I feel v. anxious if I’m running out/can’t smoke, it’s never as good as I think it’ll be, and I’m tired of how little I get done because of it.

However, whilst knowing all this, I can’t imagine not smoking every day. It’s one of the few vices I have these days - I used to have many more haha - so the idea of taking one of the last away makes me feel hopeless. I don’t know how most people get through the day without little rushes of dopamine, and I am aware of how sad that is.

I have joked that I am a “addict addict”, that it’s not necessarily what vice I’m partaking in, just that there is one. I’ve struggled with my mental health for years, I’m often either overwhelmed with emotion or feel completely numb. I think weed helped with both those states initially, now I’m not so sure.

I’m just scared of what to do and what it’ll mean. Even as I’m writing this, I’m fighting the urge to roll. I think I’m generally getting tired of relying on something to make the world feel like it has colour.",3,0

The weed itself isnt even the worst part, its everything that comes with it. Messy room from the apathy stresses me out but not enough to act on it.

My wife was against me smoking, so I was doing it mostly when she was at work or at nights in a secret from her (I’m working remotely as a software engineer so it wasn't a problem for me).

I realized that it’s not for me (will write about it below) and quit cold turkey on February 20th (thanks for this subreddit!). It was really hard - anxiety, depression, aggression, etc. Especially on day 3-5. Anyways, during withdrawal period (after day 5 when it got easier) I realized that everything is possible and I can quit smoking cigarettes as well (I was smoking cigarettes for about 6 years by that time). So I read Allen Carr's book and quit nicotine addiction as well on Feb 27th (and still clean from it for a month now!).

During March I gave up on weed (note - not mixed with tobacco) few times.. I thought I will not be hooked up by it again if I’ll smoke only once or two. So here I am again: day 4 after smoking daily for a week.

So here’s my thoughts why it’s not worth it to even try it once again:

* It doesn’t help with depression - it creates it. After smoking it even once I notice that I have depressive and suicidal thoughts for the next week or two. When I was not smoking or when I’m clean from weed for a longer period (1 month or more) I almost never have depression (or at least this hard). Never had such suicidal thoughts since my teenage years.
* It makes me more aggressive and irritable for up to 2 weeks after smoke. I become the worst version of myself.
* It makes me lazy. When I was smoking it few times a week or more my productivity were nearly at 0.

So by now I don’t see any reason to smoke it again. Sure, it makes some things more funny, more tasty, more interesting, etc. But it has very high cost. You either smoke it daily without experiencing withdrawal symptoms - but you’ll stay at mediocre position in your life. Or you can smoke it few times a month - but you’ll be very irritable and depressive all the time between smokes. 

So for me it’s just not worth it anymore.",10,0

ANYWAYS TO THE STORY!! 

RELAPSING AFTER A YEAR ISH OF BEING SOBER 

So I back in the day when I was 16 I was addicted to I finally got sober after 4 years of smoking weed everyday non stop I did not have a break within a window of 3 years. I had weed every single day. Can’t picture my life without it to be honest as in whenever I think back to a memory weed is involved. Except my marriage thank GOD.

Anyways I got sober! How? I became a church girl haha I was all about Jesus, and he helped me get over my addiction and I was free and sober living life, So it wasn’t a full year I quit from January til September ? 9months but it felt like a year because I did take another 7 to 8 month break after I relapsed from September to December of 2018. 2019 I relapsed the beginning til April then I met my husband and weed was out of the window once I felt what love was 😂 better than a high. 

After April I quit again, which Makes me so excited because we are in April so it means I have hope and it’s not impossible. 
So 2019 sober April til January of 2020. 

Yup for my New Years resolution I decided to smoke weed again. I thought it would be a great idea to introduce weed after being sober. Hear me out I was depressed and in a crisis. I was being a shitty person, when I smoked it opened my eyes completely and I haven’t been the same since 2 months ago which is crazy and probably why it’s so hard to let go this time around. 

I have experienced some benefits but more negatives. Hear me out. My benefits include, I woke up from almost cheating on my husband yes when I was sober I almost fell for someone else? Once I smoked I realized how much of a idiot I was and my eyes were opened to how loving and amazing and sweet he is. I almost ruined my life! I would have been miserable 🥺 
I was so dumb! 

But how does smoking weed make me any better if I was terrible? 
I need to quit because it’s just not for me I abuse it. How can I quit something I feel has helped me emotionally and with my growth.",3,0

I smoked heavily from age 16-20 and thought I'd never quit but now sober I've realised just how many terrible experiences in my life have been induced by weed. 

I've had multiple terrifying panic attacks. Laying in my bed utterly convinced I'm gonna die of a heart attack, desperately trying anything to slow my racing heart. 

I nearly got attacked by an ex friend's unstable dog after accidentally stepping on it's paw. I went immediately to pet the dog to say sorry and he tried to bite me. I would have been scared anyway but the weed made me such a trembling wreck that the dog could sense my fear and wouldn't leave me alone. My friends thought my fear was hilarious because they were so stoned they didn't realise what was happening. 
On the way home I was so shaken that I was actually hallucinating. 

I've overthought so much under the influence of weed that I've ended up sobbing with self loathing that took weeks to recover from. 

I've had so many fun nights turn into anxiety riddled nightmares because I smoked too much weed. Left my friends without saying a word because I'm suddenly convinced they're all judging me.

2. I have spent a relatively negligible amount of money the past week which could not have come at a better time. The money I have spent on frivolous things in that time, I don't feel guilty about.
3. I can sit for long periods of time without feeling the need to change my activity. This one might seem contrary to weed stereotypes but it's easier for me to get lost in things now. When I was stoned I would sit for maybe 15 minutes before I had an insatiable urge to do something else (whether that be switch the game I was playing or do some OCD cleaning task that wasn't necessary).
4. Fun dreams. Obvi.
5. I can actually tell you what happens in the shows/movies I've been watching. A few days ago I rewatched an episode of Paradise PD and realized I had no idea what was going to happen. I had just watched it maybe 2 weeks ago but couldn't tell u the plot to save my own johnson.
6. There has been a lot less forgetting what I was talking about/walking into a room and not knowing why I decided to go in there. As it turns out, that's not normal for a 27 ear old. Who knew?
7. Did a few chores I had been procrastinating on like getting health insurance. I was surprised how relieved I felt when that was accomplished.
8. I can breathe out of my nose more easily.
9. I don't have to plan my day around getting high.
10. My sense of smell is heightened. There have been a few smells I've caught and thought ""wow, I forgot things could even smell that vibrantly""  -- candles, food, the indescribable smell of a room, etc.

I feel a long stronger mentally and physically since quitting, but when I hear summery songs that I used to listen to back at Uni, and the sun is shining bright, I can't help but feel like a joint would go down an absolute treat. Just the thought of it. Waking up, it's real sunny, tunes playing, strolling outside and smelling the freshly cut grass, with a nicely rolled zoot to top it all off. It sounds like something from a dreamland, yet I've experienced that exact scenario plenty of times back when I was a smoker, and yes it was as good as it sounded, but those highs just lead to deeper lows.

What I'm afraid of, it's when the quarantine overs, I love hanging out with my friends, and they all smoke. Used to loved smoking with them, and it's really hard to manage that situation when I'm with them.

First of all I smoked everyday multiple times for 9 years without one day off. If I can do it YOU CAN DO IT! 

I got hit pretty hard with withdrawals and PAWS, for about 6-7 months I didn’t feel great or normal but with each passing month things improved. 

No more high blood pressure feeling, heart palpitations, night sweats, social anxiety/ anxiety, not more health anxiety, racing thoughts, difficulty focusing, intrusive thoughts, strong feelings of depression! 

Since then I met a girl I’m now dating, saved more money and been more focused at work and lungs feel much better. Quarantine may be a great time to start since you have time away from your normal lifestyle

My symptoms now are only some anxiety and some sad feelings every now and then. Sometimes I feel like I’m at a base line and those feelings are normal from the stressing times right now. 

Maaaan is it a change compared to month 2-4 where I would get extreme anxiety attacks, deep depression, extreme brain fog, no sleep. I’m happy I’m pushing through and still aware that I’m with in that average window of 6-12 months. Maybe not all the way out the woods. 

My sleep has improved thank god! That was a big one.  Brain fog is occasional but you get used to it. Keep on fighting!! For those of you that feel helpless keep pushing.

It's easy to blame the virus stress, but my inner addict was just looking for an excuse.

This isn't my first rodeo.  Getting back on my feet today.  Started my journal back up.  

Here are my reasons for quitting:

* I have been horrible about the munchies.  I have a terrible sugar and salt habit when I am high
* time moving too fast.  What happened to last week?  Wait, what weekend? 
 Where is this week going?  Time to put the breaks on.
* not able to settle down and enjoy a movie or tv show.  When I am high it's hard to even pick and start a movie.  Once I do I am really distracted and barely get anything out of it
* can't read anything when high.  Nothing sticks in my brain.  Mind wandering like crazy
* sleepy, worn out, stoney hazy feeling all day.  It starts with a pot hangover feeling in the morning
* waking up sleepy and sleeping too late
* generally having a very negative/drained/unmotivated feeling about life, myself, and being high again.  


Here is what I miss about sobriety:

* waking up fresh feeling with a clear head
* waking up earlier
* getting that REM sleep 
* feeling positive about my willpower to keep away from the plant
* generally seem to get more done in a day
* my perception of time slows way down and it seems like I get more out of a day when not high
* (slightly) easier to control my sweet and salty tooth
* not worried about lung issues at the worst possible time with this virus",14,2

I’ve been trying to quit weed forever. On and off, on and off. I never attributed the brain fog to the weed because, TWICE, I smoked weed, and the brain fog instantly and completely left my brain, I felt normal. Only come to realize now, that the brain fog WAS caused by weed, not by being high, but by withdrawing from it. Brain fog is a stage your brain goes in after dealing with stress/smoking weed, it means your brain is healing, it’s trying to go back to normal. So just give it time. A wound doesn’t heal up over night. It takes awhile.  

And if you haven’t quit yet, maybe because you can’t bare the brain fog, or anything else that goes with it, including the cravings, just keep in mind that, one day, some day down the line, you will have to quit, you will have to go through the withdrawals, the longer you smoke the worse they are, it’s better to get through it and move on with your life, move on to a better healthier life.

If anyone’s struggling with this addiction, just know, YOU CAN DO IT! YOU CAN QUIT! It will be hard, it will suck, you’re not going to want to finish it. But let me tell you, it’s worth it, the battle is worth what comes after it, the victory, the sweet sweet victory of a better life. Keep pushing never give up. The finish line may seem far away, but trust me when you’re looking back on all of this, when you’re looking back on you’re addiction, you will see it as if it happened in the blink of an eye, you will be proud of how far you’ve come and what you’ve accomplished. But for now, be proud if you’re sober, at least, if you’re not sober, get sober, even a couple hours of being sober counts for something, keep counting up your hours, I believe in you, we believe.

I'm really glad I found this place recently, but wanted to reach out for some advice, though not sure where to start.

I'm a daily user of around 15 years.  I've had a couple of windows in that time, first time I managed to stay clean for around 5-6 months before believing I could have that one social smoke and fell back into it for years.  Next time I went to live in the middle east for about a year and didn't smoke the whole time.  When I got back, it seemed inconceivable that I would fall back into old habits.  I came back feeling like I could do anything I set my mind to, the idea I would fall back into a regular smoking habit seemed almost funny.  Yet it really didn't take too long being back before I was smoking every day again.  

However since I got back, I was on my ass financially and one of my best friends offered to let me move into his place with a minimal rent.  This guy and the other friend who lived there have been a real life line since I got back and I'll never be able to repay his kindness and generosity.  However, both are quite heavy habitual smokers.  I've found it too challenging to quit while there's always the presence of a jar of weed on the table in the living room.  My partner also smokes habitually but it's been the constant presence of weed when socialising in any capacity in my own home which has broken my resolve several times,  Even when I ask them to hide it, there'll always be a dusty grinder, or even their stashes to raid, when my resolve breaks.  This has made me feel really, really shitty.  

My last quit attempt seemed to be my strongest in a long time.  I was reading this sub every day, gotten rid of paraphenalia and was marking each day on a calendar and practicing mindfulness.  I basically spent very little time around the house in order to avoid temptation.  Then the lock-down came and in a matter of days my resolve had crumbled.  Our house has ordered some pretty huge amounts of weed and I've fallen into my heaviest use for a while.  I have ADHD and have really struggled with working from home and my marijuana use is exacerbating this significantly.  The more I'm sucking at work, the more I'm smoking and I can see the situation getting worse and worse.  But the prospect of trying to quit again while my house is occupied and full of weed smoke every day after 5pm just seems impossible.  The main thing I can think to do is move back to the middle east as soon as the pandemic recedes so I can get back off the weed, but that seems like a huge move to deal with something that really shouldn't feel so crushing.  I feel lost.

I'm writing this partly to hold myself to account,  Partly, because even though my situation is challenging, it still feels like it's my addiction making excuses.  I'd like to hear if you guys have any advice for what I might do in my current situation and what I can do moving forward.  I've really valued every post I've read on here, thanks for anyone who took the time to read mine and thanks in advance for any advice offered.",6,1

What is weird with  PAWS it comes and goes in waves.  Last wave lasted a few weeks. 

I thank God everyday for soberity, but wish the PAWS roller coaster would flatten out. Life sober is awesome as all the benefits of clean living are great.   

No matter what I'm not going back to weed. Recovery has been hard road, but if it was easy what would detour a relapse? Nothing

Early quitters just know you will have some tough days, but stick with it. It's an awesome feeling to make it to 180 days sober. Stay strong my friends you can do it!",14,1
1255,2020-04-01 02:05:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fsty7x/day_4/,Day 4,"07:04: have not slept one minute read previous post, paramedics are coming to get me. going cold turkey can be dangerous guys will update later

18:56: What a damn whirlwind i've just been in. I'm feeling OK now guys, thank God. So after my first update, Paramedics then told me they actually couldn't send an ambulance as they are all being used for Coronavirus (we experienced over 580 deaths since yesterday, news has just revealed). That stunned me - basically, there are people who need paramedics right now but this pandemic is putting such a strain on the healthcare system that not every emergency can be called to. They are picking and choosing who to help (I totally understand why they need to prioritise possible coronavirus patients). They bid me good luck. I'm not gonna lie, it made tears roll down my face, I felt so helpless, like I was just being left to die. With dangerously low sugar levels, seizures and unconsciousness can follow, which can then be fatal. I ended up trying to go to any emergency room, but every hospital I called said they don't have an ER open to the public anymore due to coronavirus. I started asking for doctor appointments, they said no doctor is doing face-to-face consultations. I finally found a doctor who could come to my apartment.

The doctor tested my blood sugar levels, and whilst the reading on my meter was reading dangerously low, his meters tested as a little bit high, which he was confused about. He then tested my urine and didn't find any levels of glucose (indicates no diabetes). However there was a significant level of ketones in my urine, and he attributed that to my severely decreased diet, coupled with my increased exercise (Doing push ups and Ive had no appetite whatsoever after quitting). He was just confused as to why meters were giving different sugar levels. He said he felt he didn't need to give me a full comprehensive blood test as indicators of diabetes are dangerously high levels of sugar, not low, and on his meter, my sugar level was reading a few notches higher than the good range, which he said isn't really high enough for diabetes. But he was still a bit confused and told me to call him if anything. I was up for 28 hours since yesterday - I was meant to go to sleep at midnight but all this happened. I passed out for a few hours and now here I am. Im still a bit worried and feel very ""out of it"" but I mean what can I do, Im taking this doctor's advice. I don't feel that insane sense of thirst, which I think is because I was forcing food into my system (fruits, cookies & glucose tablets) while waiting for the doctor. I feel like my brain has been chewed up and spat out. That whole scare just has completely eradicated any craving for weed. I don't want it. I just want my health to be in the best possible form. I just want to feel normal and live a healthy life.

Anyways, not trying to spread any fear, but just trying to help people by sharing my experience. I know not everyone will react the same, but I would recommend to taper down rather than quit cold turkey if you're a very heavy user, to make sure your body doesn't go out of whack.

**Main thing all of you: It just gave a direct insight into how fucked our healthcare systems are right now, and this is only the beginning of the pandemic. They are not telling the people the full extent of how much strain they are under. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO GET SICK EVERYONE. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE KEEP UP ON YOUR GOOD HEALTH, KEEP BOOSTING YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM. LOOK AFTER YOURSELVES AND EAT WELL. For those who are quitting, PLEASE DO NOT SLIP INTO MALNOURISHMENT, WHICH CAN OPEN THE DOOR TO A PLETHORA OF HEALTH ISSUES. FORCE YOURSELF TO EAT MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY! If you are a SERIOUS HEAVY USER, consider TAPERING DOWN so it is not such a shock to your system and your food intake doesn't decrease severely due to total lack of appetite. As I said, now is not the time to get sick. I went from gorging on junk food morning until night to almost nothing, it was too much of a shock to my system.**

I'm going to get some rest. Hope all of you are OK and don't let this be a deterrent to those of you on a journey to quit. Take this simply as a helping hand on that journey, to keep you safe.

TL;DR: Paramedics cancelled the ambulance due to too many coronavirus cases, managed to get a doctor to visit, said my blood sugar was reading a bit high on his meter as opposed to mine which was showing dangerously low. Tested my urine, didn't find any glucose in it (which would indicate diabetes), although he did find significantly high levels of Ketones, which was attributed to lack of food and increased exercise. This can cause dehydration. Although he was still somewhat confused, he said for me to call him if anything.",10,11
