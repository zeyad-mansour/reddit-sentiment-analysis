I have tried over and over to quit,  and last week i made a goal to quit for 50 days... it felt more doable than saying "" forever "" . But I'd prefer to be sober forever.  

So far I'm not having any side effects, except  irritability,  which is normal for me at this point in my cycle anyway. 
I had a dream last night,  too. Which was cool. Nothing significant  or anything. I just don't think I've remembered dreams for years.  
I think about it a few times a day,  and getting through my first weekend has been challenging , but I'm feeling hopeful.

She noticed I had barely eaten anything, even though I cooked for us both. She knows how bad I get when I don't smoke, the heavy night sweats, often stressed, lethargic and sleepless at night. She doesn't smoke herself but she was pretty much telling me to go and pick up so I wouldn't be like this. I had to tell her no multiple times.

Thing is, I'm not proud of this, regardless of having the power to say no. It actually hurts a lot knowing that someone is willing to spend their hard earned cash to feed my vice just so that I can be ""normal"". It hurts knowing that I'm hurting someone who I love because I'm trying(and failing time and time again) to better myself. It hurts knowing that I'm likely to relapse at any moment... 

 I live with two other guys, both smokers. We have always smoked in the flat and got our friends over to smoke as well. It's the way it's always been and I can't just tell them to stop everything just for my sake. I can hear their grinders grind and papers rustle all the time and then there is the smell. That goddamn smell. It triggers me big time cause we all used to smoke together but now I have to distance myself. I then start to feel left out or not included which sucks because we're all friends. If we weren't still in lock down, at least we/I could go out to a pub to socialise, maybe make a new friend or two. But here I am, stuck with friends I should be avoiding. 

 I also can't move out either, I don't have a flat deposit anymore as I was abruptly made unemployed when the pandemic hit, leaving me hanging by a financial thread, surviving off student loan and the odd ¬£30 here and there as a uber rider.

It's not really my thing to share things that are getting me down hence why I am posting here instead of talking to the people around me. Probably cause I smoke myself too stupid to express myself. I thought it would help if I start to write down my thoughts and feels, possibly reflect on this later or maybe hear what others have to say and start to engage with the community instead of lurking.

I am 28 years old and a 12 year heavy smoker, my usage has cycled between various forms and usages but has always been classified as heavy. Most recently i was using more than a gram of extracts per day. I operated a blackmarket grow op for quite some time so having access was never really a concern financially. After leaving the industry I was left with enough contacts and was able to produce my own extracts very cheap. This was probably more of a curse than a blessing, i only began using as a teen because i had infinite access for free, this infinite free access never really left me. I have tried to quit so many times, i think my longest streak was 3 weeks about 5 years ago. Otherwise I haven't gone more than a week about twice.

I am writing this for probably a few reasons, mostly to keep myself accountable, i hope to be able to look back on this post and capture what i was feeling at this time at the beginning of recovery and the differences between the two states of mind. For those times that i think to myself ""oh you've got this solved, it can be a once in a while thing now"" I won't return and be fooled by that again. I don't want to get in the ins and outs of the missed years and underperformance etc. I am happy to be moving forward and we will keep it at that.

I want to become a Pilot and obviously the devils lettuce is a no no. However i have known that it hasn't boded to my lifestyle and goals for quite some time; so I am very happy to have this positive excuse to not smoke I can use with my cohorts as i prepare for my Aviation Physical.

The first few days my GF and I (who has also stopped consuming) decided to head to the mountains so we wouldn't have access to anything. We spent 3 days there, across those 3 days there was very little sleep, i was constantly cold and shaking, I had the worst diarrhea i have ever experienced in my life that got worse and peaked on day 3. The cravings were existent but not impossible. My partner and i would often just lay there laughing at how rough shape we were and how our brains kept telling us to smoke but we couldn't.

After day 3 physical symptoms began to improve and i noticed some lifting of brain fog. My energy levels were starting to increase as well. My moods were also becoming more up and down. Feeling emotions that i haven't felt in a long time, very powerful and amazing feeling. I felt anger, happiness, sadness etc all more than i could remember in a long time; and it felt AMAZING.

Days 3-5 i was more calm baseline but would react to things with over the top behaviour. We both seemed to have quite a few mood swings but the baseline was still much more stable and comfortable than when battling between burning out and coming up 12 times a day. My digestion and appetite improve across these days. Food began to taste AMAZING.

Days 5-7 mood swings seem to have improved. Chest is beginning to clear, teeth are whiter, my skin feels amazing (also been pounding probiotics) brain feels stable and clear- but i know theres still much progress to be made. I am still pretty bored but less so, fortunately its warming up so i can begin biking everyday.

I am excited to continue my recovery and improving how i am feeling everyday. I know after a while this glow will be gone and there will be hard days and i look forward to tackling them too. If i can do it, you can do it, Marijuana was so intertwined in my existence it followed every facet of my Friend, Family and Workplace life. I know there is a long journey, however theres one path that is no longer available. One statement that has helped me in this and much else is ""Its all okay in the end, if its not okay, it isn't the end""

Life.

As life loses meaning, stars lose their shine and birds lose their melody

Staring in the blank space between words people are saying

Struggles seem so pointless and out of reach

Moments that disappear as quick as a summer breeze

The feeling you once had faded into oblivion, just trying, trying to remember what it once felt like

Clinging to ordinary things, subtle things that once put a smile on your face

And as fast as it once faded, life finds a way in the most unexpected

When all that was good seems to gain ground again

The stars begin to glitter again, the melody that once filled the humble forest slowly begins to resonate inside of you

But is it an illusion? 
Did happiness originate out of such humble things i wonder..

Life finds it‚Äôs way in unexpected and ordinary things

The light that was once obliviated 
Has returned stronger as it were before

Life is good

Clearer mind, more energy, more motivation, you name it. I went to drug counseling and was told it's gonna take some time, but after a couple of months I will feel better. In the beginning I was told after two months I will start to feel more energized. After two months the rhetoric went to six months. After six months they said after a full year all the cannabinoids will have left my system and I will feel as good as before I started smoking weed. **It's been two years.**

Instead of getting high I started working out. This is one of the advices you'll see most often. And I don't say it would be wrong to do so. I still work out to this day in the hope it might click eventually.

But I just don't get to a point where I feel better. I'm so damn faded all the time, lost about all my friends who still light it up, spend all day losing myself in deep thought and randomly forget what the fuck was going on.

At the drug counseling I went to there is this project to get ex-addicts into free-climbing in nature and they tell how this activity is a natural high to them, how they experienced all those neurotransmitters in a sober way and they learned they wouldn't need drugs to feel all that anymore. I tried it, aced it, was congratulated for my success, but I didn't feel anything at all. I wasn't proud, I didn't feel accomplished, I didn't feel like I overcame a challenge. Nothing.

Like sorry already for the wall of text and I don't mean to be downer Debbie. I was just thinking maybe reaching out was gonna help some way. I'm honestly proud in everyone who makes it through this and is able to live a great life after addiction. I don't want to demotivate, I'm probably a rare case.

Today is also my first day without any beta blockers(10 mg propranolol) which I was only on for a week to get me through the initial wave of depression and restlessness. I‚Äôm glad to feel the real me again. Not intimidated to go into work or make plans.. feel like I‚Äôm reborn in a way. I‚Äôm gonna keep on keeping on.

2021-02-27 14:08:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ltv0t9/thank_you_rleaves/,Thank you r/Leaves,"It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since I‚Äôve picked up and 8 days week since I‚Äôve sat by myself, getting high, convincing myself that weed only had positive attributions to my life. This is going to be a long one, as I feel like I‚Äôve met my adult self for the first time. Feel free to read, or not, but regardless, thank you for existing in this community. It‚Äôs amazing and I feel so thankful for you all.

The truth is that I grew up with a warped view of marijuana. I had a group of stoner friends that not only partook, but were total know-it-all‚Äôs, somehow driven by proving that weed wasn‚Äôt addictive. This seemed like all they spoke about, self-proclaimed pot professionals at 14-15 years old (hilarious to think about now). In hindsight, they were just practicing the long lasting justification to come in their later years of abuse. Furthermore, a few parents in this group joined in the rotation often. Somehow, nothing feels safer than doing something illegal with someone you trust and look up to, especially a seemingly successful parent. 
I smoked all throughout high school, which was easy because I was smart. I had no issue going home to smoke at lunch then coming back to school and scoring well on my assignments and tests. Because of this, *obviously* weed wasn‚Äôt having a negative effect of me. In fact, I even believed it even gave me clarity and made me better in school. I now wonder how much further I could‚Äôve gotten in school if I had never touched the stuff. 

Fast forward, still hanging out with this group of know-it-all morons, but now we‚Äôve moved our tomfuckery to college. We‚Äôre all business/STEM majors and we think we‚Äôre so smart and invincible. By this time, we‚Äôre growing and selling. Money‚Äôs involved now so in my mind, I‚Äôm a young female entrepreneur ready to create a green empire. Nothing about this is bad, nothing. I was so sure of myself during this time, weed is now not only a fun thing to do, but it‚Äôs becoming a source of income and in a weird way, pride. 

Throughout all of this, I was in a horribly toxic relationship that was absolutely fueled by weed. 
This is where these types of habits began:
-Going to get food? Let‚Äôs get high first, it‚Äôll taste better. 
-Watching a movie? Let‚Äôs get high first, it‚Äôll be more entertaining.
-Going to a party? Let‚Äôs get high first and don‚Äôt forget the vape.
-Hungover the next morning? Let‚Äôs get high, it‚Äôll make us feel better. 
Long story short, things went south with this relationship after a fairly numb and hazy three years of dating. Looking back on it, I don‚Äôt know if I blocked certain things out of my brain because it was so mentally abusive, or if I was just too high to create long lasting memories. What a weird thought in itself.
Anyway, broke up with that toxic person and lost all of my friends in the process. In hindsight, I was looking for change (or was being forced to look for it because my family became aware of the issues of the relationship) and I realize now that change terrifies stoners. These people were all so stagnant, happy to do the same thing every single day, so long as weed was the core of it. 

Fast forward, I transfer colleges and begin new. I have no friends at this school, therefore no pot connections. But, it‚Äôs in the heart of Los Angeles, so let‚Äôs go get a med card. All of a sudden, I‚Äôm talking myself into believing I have worse menstrual cramps and migraines than I do. Sure, I‚Äôm not smoking socially, but I *need* it now for my health. Here‚Äôs where the lonely stoner phase begins. Also, here‚Äôs where the depression and anxiety start. My solution? Smoke more. Vape more. Take more edibles. 
I finished college by being unsocial and awkward. I walked (high) at graduation, by myself. Still at this point, I was seemingly succeeding at life. I graduated with honors and a respected degree. In my mind, weed even helped me do it. I even started a romantic relationship with a person I had been in love with all throughout high school and if I‚Äôm being honest, throughout said toxic relationship. I‚Äôm on top of the world, and I‚Äôm using weed for whatever reason I can find, celebration, stress, literally whatever.

So that‚Äôs the end of a 5-year weed-fueled college run followed by a solid 2 years of use in high school. I begin looking for jobs and realize I don‚Äôt even really remember anything I learned from my degree. What an incredibly frustrating realization to come to. But of course, I glaze over this by smoking more and carrying on with life. 
Three months after graduation, I score my first management job. Salary, benefits, and breaking the glass ceiling at 24 years old? I‚Äôm elated and incredibly proud of myself. I start working 65+ hours a week (restaurant management jobs fucking suck, I really encourage you to think twice before taking your anger out on these people over a wrong order or cold food). Anyway, I worked this job for a year and honestly didn‚Äôt have much time to smoke. Cut to meeting an executive chef that I look up to professionally, and he starts slipping me edibles at work. Then offering me his vape during dinner service. Before I know it, I‚Äôm high all day again. I don‚Äôt pay much attention to it, because weed is such a constant in my life. I‚Äôm successful professionally, I‚Äôm in a loving relationship, I have a great relationship with my friends family, what could be so bad about any of my habits? In my mind, they‚Äôre my decisions, and damn if they aren‚Äôt good decisions because I‚Äôm in a seemingly great place on paper.

Fast forward to the rise of Covid-19, which has been so eye opening for me. The restaurant industry is hugely impacted, especially since I live in LA County. My restaurant closes and service changes to takeout. A main goal for the management team is to save on labor costs, so I‚Äôm working even more hours as a salaried manager (my pay doesn‚Äôt change), basically working shifts for hourly employees so that the owners could save money. As time went on, I‚Äôm an absolutely mess and my anxiety and depression pushes me to quit the job.

During this time, I take the opportunity to pay more attention to my health than ever before. I‚Äôm exercising and eating well with my boyfriend, I‚Äôm cutting back on alcohol, taking care of my skin, losing weight. I even begin an online Masters program to extend my college degree. However, I‚Äôm still smoking. Now, with the lack of work, it‚Äôs constant. Wake up, smoke, cup of coffee, smoke, workout, smoke, homework, smoke, etc. You get the picture, nothing is holding me back now. This heavy use has last for the past 6 months. I lied to myself and the people close to me about it. I remained in denial and kept smoking, because, just as always, I‚Äôm doing ‚Äúgreat‚Äù so weed can‚Äôt be having any negative effect on me. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you, because all of this has brought us to a week ago. I become so numb, I forget to pick up. Long story short, I didn‚Äôt get the opportunity to for a few days. During these few days, I‚Äôm irate and emotional. I can‚Äôt sleep. When I can sleep, it‚Äôs sparse and I wake up sweating. My stomach is in constant knots and the nausea is unbearable. I don‚Äôt even want to talk to anyone, including my boyfriend, because I‚Äôm coming to the realization that brought me here. It all fucking comes to fruition. The stress, anxiety, depression, lack of motivation, it‚Äôs not all being aided by weed, it‚Äôs being brought on by weed. And now what else is being brought on by weed? Physical withdrawal symptoms. I‚Äôm terrified, I‚Äôm spending all this time trying to build up a strong immunity and now I‚Äôm dealing with withdrawal? I‚Äôm fundamentally no different than any type of addict. When I want it, I need it and when I don‚Äôt have it, I‚Äôm fucked up over it. 
I deal with the symptoms for a few days on my own, hiding it from my partner and my family. In my mind, I‚Äôll pick up soon and this will all be over. But as time goes on, and the initial symptoms die down, my stomach pains continue. I feel sick all the time. As an active person, I‚Äôm frustrated by these feelings. At this time, I decide I‚Äôm going to try to get through it and take an extended ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from weed. 

My decision to stop completely came yesterday, when I went on a hike with my boyfriend. Hiking is something we‚Äôve always enjoyed doing together, and yesterday should have been no different. We go on a mild hike that we‚Äôve been on multiple times, but this time, I didn‚Äôt even make it 1/3 of the way through. I break down, I can‚Äôt breathe and my stomach feels like it‚Äôs on fire. I start crying, my boyfriend looked so confused and concerned and I‚Äôll never forget the look on his face as he held onto me, not knowing what was happening at all. We make our way down the mountain, even though I push to go on (classic denial) but he refuses. I finally tell him everything I‚Äôve written out in this post. He lets me talk and talk and talk and come to my own conclusions without doing anything but giving me patience and pure support. As someone who doesn‚Äôt personally like weed, I‚Äôm amazed by his ability to not judge me as I‚Äôm telling him all of this. I love this person so much, I want to be better not only for me, but for him too. I came to the conclusion, with his support, that perhaps this substance just shouldn‚Äôt be part of my life at all anymore.

I look back on how much I‚Äôve accomplished as a stoner, and it almost feels like an accident. Like I mentioned, I feel like I‚Äôve met myself for the first time. Almost like all this time, I‚Äôve been a passenger in the car I‚Äôm driving. While I wonder how much more I could have done, I am choosing to not beat myself up. I‚Äôm also choosing to not ignore my realizations, like I have done so many times before. 

It‚Äôs been 8 days and my only lasting withdrawal symptom are these stomach issues, but I have hope for improvement, as I have been reading all of your helpful posts nonstop. My brain no longer gets a notification to smoke before doing things daily activities. I have a new outlook on life, love, and overall, addiction and what it can do to your body and brain. I feel a weird sense of disgust for this phase of my life, but in a way it‚Äôs kind of liberating. It really feels like a new chapter. I joke that this is the 2.0 version of myself, but all jokes aside, I truly believe this. I hope to not revisit that old chapter, I‚Äôve already read it multiple times and it‚Äôs always got the same shitty ending.

I‚Äôm so grateful for this community, how lucky I am to have stumbled upon you. I used to be nervous to even read the posts (denial again). But here I am, feeling clarity, motivation, happiness, a sense of humor and above all, so much love. 
Thank you for taking this long walk with me. I wish you all the best on whatever journey you‚Äôre on. I wouldn‚Äôt be here without you, so by all means, reach out to me if you ever need a sobro (sober bro, good right? I just made that up lol)

Since quitting I have had major problems with nausea and appetite.  I feel hungry constantly but if I eat more than a few bites, or if it is remotely aromatic, I can't keep it down.  Also I've been constipated since stopping and when I can go it is runny and I feel like sick as I'm doing it (not from the smell just from the act itself).  Lastly I'm getting mild headaches and dizzyness after going on relatively short walks with my dog and usually end up dry heaving my way back because I feel awful.

It's been 5 years of this now with little more than a week break once or twice. Every time I stop smoking the emotional pain of that break up all comes flooding back in because I guess I never allowed myself to process it. That's not even that bad though I could handle that but the insomnia I experience when I try giving up makes me think I may not be strong enough to do this. I literally work an extremely active job which starts at 7am and come home physically shattered but when getting in to bed my mind just starts racing with how much I've let myself down over these past few years. I have a really good job opportunity coming up and an interview next week and I'm just dreading having to do it running on no sleep.

I got myself so deeply into a rut that climbing out of this is proving to be near impossible. Cannabis wasn't my only issue over these years, I spent a year living in a homeless shelter and wound up hooked on Benzos but it's been near 2 years now since I beat that with the help of cannabis mind you. I would sniff anything in front of me and drink whenever the opportunity was there. Looking back I think I was majorly suicidal but just didn't want to go through with it.

I've pushed every single genuine friend I had away to the point where they don't ever contact me and I honestly don't know how to not be alone at this point. They tried to help me when they could see me falling but I kept pushing them away or ignoring and I can't expect people to keep trying forever. Now the only people that contact me are literally junkies who I thought were friends for to long. My family are really unsupportive and actually contribute to my addictions.

I've actually been doing so much better the past year but I feel like I've reached a point where I am not going to develop any further until I leave this behind. I don't even know why I'm posting this just hoping for some words of wisdom from anyone who's experienced anything similar.

Maybe it will help some fellow brother or sister in need. 

***Really sorry for the long story below***

**Framework:**

So I've been smoking for 6 years, daily usage, starting from 1g  to 20-25g per week. I don't even wanna talk about the wasted money on all this period of time. The problem was that I always thought in the past that it's my money and I do whatever I want with them, but actually, for few years I was working just to satisfy my addiction. Maybe I could do more with those, invest in my music (I'm a singer in a rock band) and various vocal courses that could help me evolve. Happily, since the end of 2019, I've started to get a classical music professor and I'm still doing it. 

**Mindset:**

My problem was that I always thought that it helps me to make music and boost my creativity, which is not totally wrong, but everything comes with a price, right? Poor sleep, generally low energy, diving deep in my own depressive thoughts. The good part was that my true friends never left me, and let me do my thing in my own ways. Actually, I always took care not to disturb them with my addiction like forcing them to smoke with me or put them in an uncomfortable situation. Usually, if we were meeting to drink something in a bar or went to a party, I was smoking just before I left my home to meet them. Somehow I have created my own habits and always had a center point on smoking before doing something. My day was about when is the time to smoke my next spliff.  

**Critical point:**

The world pandemic came, we had to work from home which was my ""perfect"" reason to start smoking just as I got up (always with a hangover). My morning was like this: a few spliffs + coffee. And strangely, my hangover always disappears after that, or I couldn't feel it anymore because I was too stoned to feel. Alcohol is not my weapon of choice but at some point, I was drinking a bottle of whisky or wine in 2-3 days. At that moment I thought it's fun and nice, but my morning became harder and the sleep quality very low (3-4 hrs per night even if I was working from home). I begin having suicidal thoughts, like this: ""why should I live?"", ""I'm unworthy"", ""I don't mind if I die tomorrow""

Besides this, I meet a girl(beginning of 2020) and after a time she came to live with me. Before she came to live with me I told her: ""Look, I love smoking and I really enjoy it, if you wanna live with me like this, sure, otherwise this won't work"". Guess what, she said, ""Ofc, it's not a big deal"". She was also smoking from time to time. But the moment when she had enough came, and she couldn't manage to help me with, and she has done some things to me even worse, but this is another story. As a resume, I was left with a lot of anger, anger that boosted my addiction, and there were days in which I smoked 6-8g per day. And this was the point when I started drinking a lot. There were days I couldn't work (I'm a test automation engineer in a software development company) and started to hate to sing. Nothing was fun anymore. I made some maths, and in 2020 I had at least 850g smoked through the year, which is huuuge for me. a very huge amount to think about and reflect on.

**Recent events:**

A few weeks ago I when to refill my stash, but never thought that the police will ever start to surveil me. Always bought just for me, very rarely gave some to my friends from my personal stash. It seems like the ex-GF snitched me to the police for her stupid personal reasons. I can't think of somebody else because I am a very discrete dude, always minding my own business. On that day I almost got arrested(in my country if you have more than 2g on you can be considered illegal and you can go to jail for a year or two, or you have to snitch someone for them, which I will never do). I had way more on me, for personal use. so as soon as I learned from a guy that the police started to ask questions about me I had to stop. To be honest, my brain was like this: ""risk it, risk it, you need to smoke, buy more"" but all my close friends started to tell me to stop immediately and this is what I've done. Even if I didn't want it at the beginning. I was scared of not smoking anymore to be honest with you, not that I might end in jail for a year or two.

**Final thoughts:**

Now I'm smoke-free for almost 3 weeks. As always, the first days were horrible, even if this was not the first break. In the past years, I tried to moderate or quit, with no result. I couldn't enjoy smoking anymore(maybe last 2 years) but I continue with my habits all the way.

Now I start sleeping normally, at least 6-7 hrs per night, my depression is almost gone, I have clearer thoughts through the day, my productivity was boosted a lot, and I am still able to make music. All my close friends say: ""dude, you are completely another person, I can totally feel that"". 

This is my longest smoke-free period, and I'm feeling greater day by day. I am feeling like I just took a tab and I wait for the peak to start kickin' in, no joke. I feel present and I'm still enjoying playing some video games without the need to smoke in order to make the gaming experience better.

What can I say is that I stopped living with a denial thought that smoking is not harming my mind. Right now I feel like I start taking control of my body, finally, after all these years.

I want to note, that I still love the smell, the taste, and the mindblowing feeling after I smoke, but I can't go back there anymore. I will smoke from time to time when the occasion occurs, but I will not buy any. 

As a final thought, be strong brothers and sisters, and have faith that after quitting you will start feeling again the HIGH OF LIFE and your body will thank you for this. I really hope my story will motivate you guys to stop smoking and enjoy the real life. Of course, it will not be easy, but for sure you will thank yourself for making the decision to finally break the circle.

Sorry again for the very long story up ahead. Also please excuse any spelling mistakes that I made, but English is not my mother tongue.

In the moment I was choosing to ""let go of the addiction"",
But in reality what i was really choosing was to be in the drivers seat and take back my life. To remove the thing I could use to blame my circumstances on.
I used to smoke to suppress the fact that I just wasn't happy. By smoking I gave up that responsibility. I actively chose to forsake my own self.

3 months sober and I'm sure, without a doubt that I made the right decision. And that participating in my own life, feeling my own emotions and acknowledging I have pain has been a catalyst for my own growth. 
For that I am thankful.

I don't resent myself anymore for smoking, I am glad it served me well, for so long. It kept me functioning and able to pretend things (and I) were okay.
And ultimately it led me to face myself and all my demons without running.

Im here now, able to see clearly that I, along with many carry what seems to be unbearable pain. I can pretty accurately pinpoint the moment I started to self-medicate and from this place I have the capacity to truly start to forgive myself and heal.

The hard days are okay and I accept them with curiosity as to what I can learn - what perspective do I need to adopt to find some relief. Gratitude helps.

Im deeply grateful for all the people on here who have taken time to share - I was always inspired here.

So for anyone trying to make the change or start the process of change. I encourage you to start thinking curiously about your future. What if you do succeed in making this change? What if you start coping without it? What if you become an ex smoker?
And enjoy the process of finding your future in your answers because it is 150% in your right to do so.

I have been abusing alcohol and weed for 11 years now. I am one month sober because I needed a life change. I had a period of time I was 9 months sober a couple years ago but beyond that it was about an eighth a day of top shelf weed and drinking 6-10 alcoholic drinks a day. 

Quitting this time was a lot easier, however which brings me to my nightmares. In the past sobriety I had vivid nightmares/dreams that I could not discern the difference between a dream or real life. But this time, it‚Äôs been even when I nap for an hour, and it‚Äôs only been nightmares constantly for the past few weeks. It scares me. They range from all sorts of different things. 

I don‚Äôt remember the vivid nightmares or dreams being this intense and non stop, day in and day out. Does anyone have any advice to help calm the nightmares? It‚Äôs getting really frightening and I need some support from this lovely group. I think this time around , the only thing I want is to turn off my dreams, but I know that can‚Äôt happen. I know I can‚Äôt smoke weed again, I will abuse it even at the slightest first hit. I‚Äôm just at a loss of words at how to embrace the nightmares or change them to dreams or control them or if anyone has been through this with similar experiences and can offer advice. It‚Äôs mentally wearing me down and usually I have some efficient approach to things. It‚Äôs giving a huge sense of loss of control. 

Even if there is no ‚Äúfix‚Äù, I guess thank you for letting me share and taking the time to read my post. If anyone needs advice on quitting weed that has abused both alcohol and weed as much as I did.. I can definitely help, pm or leave a comment here. Otherwise, I just want to say I‚Äôm entirely grateful for this sub reddit being here so I want to give back where I can.

I‚Äôm happy to have found this community and am sure it will aid me in my journey. 

I want to quit. But I‚Äôm so scared. I suffer from pretty severe depression and anxiety (I take antidepressants for this but they haven‚Äôt been working last few years, my doctor has mentioned switching to new medication) as well as a plethora of other mental health issues, and I‚Äôm terrified of my symptoms getting worse when I quit. 

I was hoping to connect with people who‚Äôve quit a heavy smoking habit while depressed etc. How can I best prepare myself? How can I best set myself up for succes? How do I get over my fear of feeling worse when I‚Äôm already barely making it through the day? Would it be better to quit before switching medications? Or would it be better to wait until the adjusting period of getting off my current meds and on the new meds has stabilized? I want to quit but am afraid of my depression and anxiety and emotional dysregulation. I know it‚Äôll eventually all get better, and quitting is the best thing I can do for my mental health, I‚Äôm just terrified of those first daysweeksmonths(?) seeing my current state.

Last two days I've finally not had any cravings. It has been amazingly liberating to not have weed and everything that goes with it in my life.   
No more anxiety about when I'm going to smoke, hiding the smell, trying to get through the day just hoping to make it to 5pm, figuring out the money, and then dealing with the lack of energy and motivation when I was sober.  
I've been thinking I only smoke because I like it. It is not actually creating any problems. Everything is actually going well. 

But that was just the weed. That was the addict in me giving me the stories needed to keep me smoking, keep me wanting. Masking the reality and giving me a false sense of calm and holding me in this perpetual selfish cocoon that was perfect and rewarding. But man it was costing me everything. 

Now that I've been sober, I have my motivation back, clarity and a clear sense of just how little I have engaged in anything. Even when I thought I was engaged but it was a fraction of what I actually bring to the table. The rest of the motivation was sitting in my weed drawer for the last 5 years. 

Last two days I've not had any cravings. It is truly a gift to have my mind back. I know I will have them again but right now it feels peaceful. 

I still don't sleep well, but that will come. Or it won't. But that's my life and I want to deal with it myself. Not under the fog and protection of this drug.

I have just woken up to day 3 of sobriety, I don't believe in miracles but considering that even 1 day without my security blanket is hell, I am glad to have made it this far. It really struck a chord with me when I read a post here on leaves that mentioned ""Its not you Mary Jane, its me."" I do believe that this plant can really help some people, but in my case, it no longer serves a purpose. When life was truly shitty, it helped bring me to a place of acceptance which is great in the moment, but long term just set me back.

 I did the maths to see what this cost me in terms of my time and money, I picked a brand new hobby which is running (It was important for me personally to find something that I have no association with Marijuana.) Then I made a bullet point list of who my ideal self is, I read this several times a day along with the mantra, I am not a stoner. Lastly, when a thought to get stoned comes along, I don't fight it, I just have a laugh with myself and say no dude, we can't get stoned, I need to get some coding done, I don't want to lie in bed and eat oreos and watch south park. To anyone struggling, you can beat this, don't give up, if you fall off the horse, just get back on.

I‚Äôve been a daily user for 8 or 9 years now (I‚Äôm 28) and even before that pretty frequent smoker from the age of 14 or 15. I had the occasional 2 week break for holidays and Christmas time, or for tolerance. Longest was 6 months off but that was about 7 years ago so my dependency wasn‚Äôt as severe. 

In recent years I‚Äôve taken to dabbing and loved it but then around 6 months ago I started getting infrequent heart palpitations. Mainly after heavy drinking but in the last 3 months they started to get more and more frequent. I went to the hospital about 3 weeks ago as I was so concerned and the doctor advised I cut down on the weed.

I started by reducing dramatically but not quitting. Cut out dabs straight after the hospital and went down to flower 3 times a week.

I started to get dizziness right away and anxiety. 5 days ago I decided to go cold turkey and have had some classic symptoms this week: very vivid dreams, loss of appetite, continued heart palpitations (my most concerning symptom), anxiety, low mood, irritability, and some brain fog too.

I am feeling a little better than yesterday but it comes in waves, very dizzy and anxious this afternoon.

I‚Äôve been reading online and most medical websites seem to say these symptoms peak around 5-7 days and within a month mostly fade. That‚Äôs at odds to other forums I‚Äôve seen where people talk about having symptoms that get worse over the first two months and last for years after quitting.

And do you feel like you‚Äôre pushing your problems to the side and rather than reaching emotional resolution with certain events?

Well I‚Äôve been reading why we sleep recently (fab book couldn‚Äôt recommend more) and just got to the bit about dreams. 

One study in particular caught my eye whereby people who have just gone through a painful emotional event and were said to be in a depressive episode were first asked to recall their emotions as a result of this event, be it a difficult breakup/divorce or loss of a loved. Then, participants were asked to keep a record of their dreams for the following year before a follow up assessment of their depression one year on.

Participants who had had dreams of the same emotional theme/ nature as the source of their trauma were more likely to have recovered and showed less signs of clinical depression compared to others who did not have relevant dreams.

Walker lists other studies as evidence for his view that dreams help us come to terms with emotional events in a safe, personal space as a sort of nightly therapy.

So how does this relate to weed?

Well when reading this I thought how I rarely dream after I smoke, before googling it and finding that cannabis (particularly when high in THC content) reduces REM sleep (the stage of sleep where dreaming occurs).

So, you may now see where I‚Äôm going with this...

It seems that continuously smoking weed may prevent us from resolving emotional traumas and leave us less likely to pull ourselves out of depression.

Just a thought I had and felt like typing it out!

This is my first post here but hoping to share my experience and hopefully get a better understanding of what's happening to my mind.

Around Jan 20th (roughly a month ago) I quit cold turkey - No reason other than I just didn't want to get high anymore. I vaped thc everyday from 5pm until about 2-3am (8 hours) for about a year and a half. I didn't smoke for any reason other than I just wanted to get high eat food and play video games. It was never for any underlying condition.

2 days after quitting - I felt the withdrawal symptoms (debilitating anxiety, lack of sleep, lack of appetite, and oh boy the dreams)

Over time the anxiety slowly receded and I started to feel better, I was getting better, I was feeling great.

Where I am today:

About 2 days I woke up in morning with the anxiety, lack of sleep and loss of appetite again in full swing. Has anyone ever experience this where the symptoms come back in full swing after a month?

[content warning: gross stuff / tar],"Guys I don't really have anywhere else to post online anonymously and this is not information that I really want to share publicly on any social media accounts of mine that represent my real self, so anonymously on reddit it is. This is something I really have wanted to get off my chest, an unintended side affect of years of smoking a lot of weed.

I was a daily smoker of many bowls per day the last few years straight. Since stopping for more than two weeks and not smoking a single thing, I've been coughing up black tar. It is disgusting and scary. However, I did a lot of research and I believe this is the natural process of my lungs' cilia filtering out gunk that should never have been in my lungs to begin with. I don't believe it's a sign of lung cancer or anything necessarily, just my lungs purging gross matter that has been inside them for too long.  


I want to explain to anyone young who is on here thinking weed is a totally harmless habit... I have been extremely unhappy coughing up tar a couple of times a day for the last week. Initially it was just little bits of black specs in my spit after having a hard cough, but today it was a big glob of black specs.  


If I had realized this was a possible side effect of marijuana smoking years ago, I would have moved to edibles or even quit the habit entirely earlier.

The purpose of my post is to get this off my chest and to let others know that... smoking has consequences. I have also sort of self diagnosed myself as having symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a disease that if I actually do have it, I will have it for life although the symptoms can be managed but a severe case of this disease is very very deadly, reducing life expectancy to 5 years.

I don't think I will ever combust plant material of any sort into my lungs again, and I regret doing so so often in my 20's. I am 32 years young and if I DO have COPD, or lung cancer, or something, I'm going to be very upset with myself for my past actions.

Fortunately this hasn't impacted my quality of life greatly yet... I still feel healthy, I still jog every other day. And only once I QUIT smoking for longer than a week did my lungs begin to purge this nasty black tar.

That was probably the hardest thing for me to do. I depended on weed so much to deal with my CPTSD. It numbed me to the abuse, the memories, the grieving of horrible treatment and my maladaptive coping mechanisms. Being sober is like raw dogging life. Seeing the world more clear is beautiful and scary. I‚Äôm scared for when I‚Äôm triggered and I don‚Äôt have my more or less mental pacifier.

This is probably gonna be long, so bear with me.

I  have had my first encounter with weed when I was 16 - never bought it  myself, just smoked when some friends brought it over (3-4 times a year  max). But at the age of 19, shortly after I broke up with a girlfriend  of 3,5 years(she was strongly against all drugs, although us breaking up  had nothing to do with drugs) I started buying weed myself, started  smoking by myself and more frequently, and sooner than I care to admit,  smoking weed has become a daily activity.

I  didn't think of it as something negative for a long time though. I  didn't even consider it being a coping mechanism with the breakup. I  used to get absurdly high from small amount of weed and really treasured  the time I was high. I suddenly REALLY enjoyed playing videogames /  working out / going for a run with my dog, and pretty much every daily  activity that I used to do before smoking weed.I managed to finish my  first year of college(I study computer science)  and gain scholarship  thanks to my good grades, which made me glorify weed even further. I  kept thinking of myself in high regard(pun intended lol) and started to  look down on others, who didn't do so well in my classes.

I  continued smoking weed on daily basis the entire summer holidays, going  to festivals and trying out some other drugs for the first time in my  life. ""Finally I can enjoy myself now that I am no longer bound by a  girlfriend"" is what I was thinking back then. This wild mindset of mine  didn't last that long and ended together with the summer holidays  though.

During my 2nd year of  college I studied a lot, probably twice as much as during the first  year. Thanks to COVID all the classes switched to online, which back  then, made me really happy. I just abused weed starting with the classic  wake'n'bake every single day, never leaving my house except for grocery  shopping once in a while. I barely had any interaction with peers,  almost none with ""new"" girls.I once again finished the school year  earning scholarship, but it felt much different this time. It didn't  feel a tiny bit accomplishing. I gained no dopamine even though I  thought I should be feeling really good about myself and all the work  I've put into studying. I would say this made me realize the harsh truth  about weed and marked the start of a really depressive period.

I  blew almost all the money I gained from scholarship on weed during the  summer holidays, because my tolerance was off the charts. I didn't have a  SINGLE day of not smoking for over a year for sure. I didn't even enjoy  smoking during a lot of days anymore, yet I still smoked because it  made me numb and repressed all the negative emotions. But it has  eventually gotten to a point where weed could no longer get me high  enough to repress the negative feelings and I started getting  emotionally overwhelmed. When I was sober I couldn't think about  anything else but getting high, but when I was high, I couldn't think  about anything else but quitting weed. Every toke made me hate myself  more and more, but I somehow still couldn't bring myself to quit and  continued smoking.

I then met a  girl who changed my life (for better or worse? i guess both). To say  that she looked like a 10/10 in my book is an understatement. We had  very similar humor, interests and just general outlook on life. I don't  think I've ever ""vibed"" this much with anyone else in my life. We  literally thought of same shit at the same time and usually didn't even  need to finish our sentence for the other one to grasp the point. And  she didn't even smoke weed, which gave me hope that I could totally kick  the habit if we got together. There was one problem though, and a  pretty big one - she studies abroad and she was home only for the summer  holidays. Since COVID exists, it was not possible for us to meet for  over a year, maybe even 2 years once she leaves and we were both well  aware of that. Neither of us wanted to initiate anything  sexual/relationship-y because we knew it woldn't end well. But well...  since both of us are just human beings, we ended up having sex a few  times and had a couple of memorable moments during the end of summer  holidays. I got reeaaally emotionally attached, but she didn't seem to  feel the same way. She really liked me, but didn't love me I guess, if  that makes sense.

She then left  for college abroad and I returned to my old, sad, pot-smoking fuckface  of a self. The sadness was on a much higher level this time though. We  continued exchanging messages on daily basis, occasionally  video-chatting but since we both knew we aren't seeing each other any  time soon and our day-to-day life became very routinous, we gradually  stopped talking at all. Her absence was driving me insane. I pretty much  doubled my daily weed intake and even had days when I didn't do  anything besides rolling and smoking, trying to forget.

My  college started at the same time as hers, but I didn't really seem to  care for the first 2-3 months tbh. I skipped a lot of my classes and god  knows how I managed to pass the semester in the end. Right now I'm in  my last semester of the Bachelor's degree, but due to me doing nothing  but smoking weed I am pretty much sure I'll have to repeat this year  (too many assignments piled up for me to finish in time right now).

This  is now my second real attempt at quitting weed. The first time I tried  was after I completely mentally broke down on this new years eve and  ended up calling this girl the next day, sobbing and spouting nonsense  about how much I love her and whatnot. She didn't seem to be upset about  me calling and handled the call quite well, although I'm sure it wasn't  pleasant experience and we haven't talked since then. She told me the  relationship really isn't possible and I should forget about her. I then  didn't smoke for 9 days (longest i've gone without smoking for the past  \~2.5 years was 1 day) but Mary Jane got a hold of me once again.

I've  been wake'n'baking once again ever since 11th of January. My college  performance has decreased severely, my apetite is terrible, I feel tired  right after waking up, I feel almost no joy from activities I used to  do - playing videogames, working out, going with my dog, cooking myself  food, etc.. I stopped talking to pretty much all my friends because I am  constantly thinking negatively and I don't want to bring that  negativity onto others. My mind feels very foggy, I feel suicidal but I  won't do it because of my parents. The field that I'm studying no longer  feels right and I have lost all sense of ""myself"" - I feel like I'm  lost and can't think of any future that involves me being happy. I feel  like leaving this world is the easiest and most comfortable option.

Although  I can't choose that option just like that, so here I am writing this  post to kill time and cope with the withdrawal symptoms.

If  you've read this far, thank you very much and I would really  appreaciate some sort of feedback - maybe some things that helped you  with quitting weed or dealing with a similar situation as I am in. I  love you all",11,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7347273}"

If you‚Äôve ever seen the TV Series LOST this will make sense to you. 

If you haven‚Äôt, the long and short of it is there is a bunker on an island where a button on a Commodore 64 must be pushed every 108 minutes to negate the buildup of extreme electromagnetic energy. If the button isn‚Äôt pushed, the buildup of energy becomes catastrophic and will result in a ‚Äúsystem failure‚Äù. Someone should have scripted that so the button doesn‚Äôt need to be physically pushed...

Today is 108 days (really, yesterday, but still). If you‚Äôve read my previous posts, you‚Äôll know I try to associate number of days with my completely useless tome of knowledge of pop culture movies, TV, or music. 

108 by itself is significant in a few ways. This is the most time I‚Äôve been sober in at least 8 years. The amount of personal growth I‚Äôve experienced in this time has been incredible. My career is fulfilling and going well. My relationships are being repaired. 

In other ways, I‚Äôm trying to determine my baseline while sober. I‚Äôve had multiple stressors that have happened in this time. Leading in my career field, supporting my Wife through some major challenges, ensuring my kids are successful, and supporting my family while contending with my Mom‚Äôs sudden death 2 weeks ago. 

I can handle a lot, is what I‚Äôm coming to realize. I just fear the weight and consistency of the pressure will cause a ‚Äúsystem failure‚Äù like the LOST example. I‚Äôm trying to determine the difference between pushing my limits and overcoming adversity versus burning myself out. 

In all this time, every time I‚Äôve thought of lighting up, the thought immediately gets pushed out of my mind - I don‚Äôt want to slide backwards and I know that none of these things would be easier if I were high. Even through all the stress and pressure I still feel that way. 

I‚Äôm proud to be at 108 days. And now 109 and more. I just know that people are counting on me and I am counting on me. It‚Äôs difficult to take time and just...be. To contend with my loss and have that be the singular focus. 

If anyone has any advice I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it. I‚Äôm still going and won‚Äôt be stopping, and I know I have the capability to stay clean and on the path. I just can‚Äôt have a ‚Äúsystem failure‚Äù and collapse due to burnout.",13,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46836898}"

Either way it was not fun.,"Yesterday I went for a hike alone, at the top of a cliff we have by the river to throw away my pieces. Dramatic but it was hard and I wanted to signify the importance by going back to a place I started smoking at as a teen. It‚Äôs a popular spot but there was only like 3 cars when I parked because it was sprinkling rain. 

While walking along the trail on the edge I(30F) passed a guy. I immediately felt nervous and decided to stop to let him pass. Then I moved to the inner side of the trail before he passed bc my mind was like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt stand by the cliff - he could push you off‚Äù 

He keeps walking, says hi, and I keep going. 

Then I stop at an overlook and notice this guy shortly behind me which took me by surprise because I hadn‚Äôt heard him. He kinda looked at me but kept walking down the trail. I let him go awhile before continuing. 

He must have decided to turn around bc then I see him coming back. I again, stop to let him pass. As he‚Äôs passing he says ‚Äúhola‚Äù and I just said ‚Äúhi‚Äù back which he kinda seemed surprised by. 

I‚Äôm socially anxious so I prolly looked shy or avoidant. I also look like a damn child, not 30 years old. This guy seemed just out of place and nervous too. 

He walks past me, I keep walking to another overlook and then I felt a sudden urge to look back. He was down the trail looking at me. As soon as he saw me he looked away and then looked back. At that point my survival anxiety kicked in to full drive. 

I stopped and kept starting. He walked off and then came back to look again. It was super weird. Like why not just keep walking. I‚Äôm just staring at him to make sure he knows I see him. In my head I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwtf is this large grown ass man doing staring at me‚Äù. 

I bent down and picked up two jagged rocks, one for each hand. In my head I was like ‚Äúbitch I‚Äôm ready‚Äù and my adrenaline is just pumping bc the guy isn‚Äôt leaving and continuing to look at me. 

I walk down to a side trail behind some trees and keep staring him down. I dial 911 on my phone but don‚Äôt press call, just held it there in case. He saw me still, behind the trees and was just acting weird by not leaving. In my head I‚Äôm like ‚Äúbro you see me, a tiny girl, getting freaked out by you, keep walking!! Unless you are waiting to get me??‚Äù 

I‚Äôm literally freaking out. I calm myself down a bit and tell myself I‚Äôm just being paranoid and continue on my mission of smashing my glass and throwing it down the cliff. I accomplish this - yay! But I was still worried to go back to get to my car bc what if he is waiting in the bushes for me. 

With 911 still on my phone dial, I use the bag I brought my pieces in and fill it with the biggest rocks I can find. Still holding the two rocks in my hands, my bag of rocks in my right and my cell in the left, I slowly walk down the trail, listening to every leaf crackle in the wind. 

Not even that far down, there he is!!! Now he‚Äôs on his phone, speaking in Spanish and pacing back and forth and again, looking at me. 

I stand there in my tracks again and think of my options. There‚Äôs only one way back. 

I convince myself to go, knowing I will fight for my life if I have to. He doesn‚Äôt say anything to me as I walk by him, just looks at me go. I practically sprint down the rest of the trail while looking back every few seconds until I get to my car. Some kids pass me on their way up. I get to my car sit down, relieved I‚Äôm alive. Not even 10 min later, here comes that guy and gets in his car and just drives off. Doesn‚Äôt look at me at all. 

Dude like I still don‚Äôt know what his deal was. He was making me so uncomfortable. I hate that being a girl makes you experience these feelings when you are just trying to be normal. But I hate even more that weed makes me so damn paranoid that I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs real anymore. This guy probably just thought I was crazy? I don‚Äôt fuckin know. But really why did he go to the top of a cliff to make a phone call in the rain.... right???  

Im so done with this stuff. Nothing is fun anymore because it‚Äôs all too stressful. After this I spent a good 4 hours driving around town to a million different stores and not going into half of them bc I was too anxious and indecisive about what I wanted to do. Weed steals my ability to just experience life as life. I can‚Äôt even grocery shop without having a fuckin meltdown and giving up.

I physically cannot eat without smoking first. If I don't smoke, just thinking about food makes me feel sick.

I always had problems with nausea which is why I started smoking, but it turned into a major dependency/addiction and now I can't eat at all without it. 

But I can't keep smoking. It's ruining my life.. I got rid of my stuff and I am done.

At one point I briefly quit for a few months, and then thought I could smoke casually, but it slowly turned back into an every day habit until I was in a worse place than before. I quit again *almost* 2 years ago!

When I quit I was depressed, so socially anxious that I struggled to look anyone in the eye, and I truly hated myself. Today I feel like a completely different person. I have more energy and motivation, I am so much more ""sharp"" and alert, I feel comfortable meeting and talking to new people, I am better at dealing with stress, and most importantly - I have learned to like who I am, and I would honestly describe myself as a happy person. 

Progress was slow, and it was really rough in the beginning. I had intense depersonalization that lasted several months, I actually developed a nervous tick during that time that still persists to this day (though very rarely shows itself anymore). 

---

I would say things started to really improve around 6 months in. 

For a while I would still think of weed every day, but it would be in the back of my mind, not intense cravings. I don't even know when it happened, but most days I don't even think of weed AT ALL anymore!

But tonight - I was walking my dog late at night, it was quiet, snow was falling, and it was so beautiful. I had this feeling I have not felt in a very long time: *""this would be really nice if I were high"".*

But then I thought about it more. Within this past year or so I have improved myself so much. I exercise frequently, I have an amazing new job with awesome coworkers, I have so much more confidence, motivation, energy, and HAPPINESS. 

And in that brief moment, the way I felt so content thinking about the person I have become, it felt so much better than a temporary high. 

It is really hard to quit in the beginning, and we may always be faced with the occasional craving. But the cravings are temporary. The high is temporary. The person we can become when sober is permanent, and it feels really fucking good.

I spent the first two years of college at a community college & worked full time. By that time, I was already accustomed to regularly being high at school or work and it only got worse. I started religiously smoking every morning, before every work shift, and before most classes.

Though I was high all the time, I was getting straight A's and hustled at my job. It was even a joke with some of my friends that I performed better when I was high (.. ha ha ..)

During my junior year, I moved to a university and quit weed (occasionally smoking on the weekends) for the majority of the year. It wasn't horribly hard to quit at the time. I was well aware that my habit was keeping me from performing my best at school and work. I was determined to do well to ultimately have a successful career with a nice salary after college.

However, the reality of mental illness settled in pretty quickly. Something that I've struggled with most of my life but never admitted until this point in my life when I believed it was no longer possible for me to continue without treatment.

I started smoking weed religiously again at the end of my junior year. Before most classes, every day before work, every night. Honestly, I felt like I was doing it just to help cope with living at times.

I quit for a few months and a few weeks a few times after that. But every time I went back to weed I noticed that I would start smoking more often. I was getting more dependent.

Well, now here I am today. I've been working from home as an IT consultant, and I will say that working from home was probably the worst thing that could have happened to my addiction. I'm currently smoking basically every hour.

It's come to a point where I am barely performing at my job and I feel absolutely horrible about it. I've never been without a job since I was 15 yrs old. I am now in fear that I am going to lose it. Or at least I feel like I deserve to lose it.

So, I know I need to stop. I've known this for a while. But I just need to do it. I'm having trouble getting my brain to wrap around that even though I am actively thinking it.

I promise you that if I had been stoned when the office called, I would have just rolled over and resigned myself to more suffering and despair. Hell, if I hadn‚Äôt been sober a month ago when I had what was quite literally the worst doc appt of my life, I probably would have stayed at that practice and wouldn‚Äôt have even gotten half this far.

Prior to that I was smoking around 3-4 times a day (for about 10 years).   At first I was super apprehensive to quit, I relied on weed for a lot: appetite, stress, sleep...happiness.  First few days/week were miserable, couldn't sleep and when I did I had horrible nightmares.  On top of that my stomach issues (which now that I think about it believe were always attributed to my weed use) were flaring up bad and I was incredibly irritable.

**side note**

I had been struggling with a mystery stomach issue for about two-three years prior to quitting.  I'm detailing it as it may pertain to some of you who currently do or did smoke heavily.  The symptoms of this stomach issue included: severe bloating, nausea, vommitting, cold/hot sweats.  All of which seemed to be triggered by either stress, ANY alcohol, and/or certain/random foods (ie really fried foods or really fatty foods).  Since quitting I have had 0 bad flare ups.   Which is honestly amazing to me because for years doctors struggled to tell me what was going on or offer any form of help.

About two months into quitting I caved and took a few puffs off a vape pen on Christmas day.  Feeling high again was nauseating.  I hated myself for it.  Moral of this story, stay strong, quitting is definitely worth it.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.693466}"

This post is to mark,"As was the point of the point of the post, my last post saying ""This is the last time"" feels embarrassing now that I've fallen back in. After a week free, I was twitchy, hadn't slept more than 2 hours the whole week, I was a mess and I thought it was ""just the withdrawals"" so I caved and smoked a joint over the weekend and ended up sleeping finally...but I still felt like shit. Sure, I was finally able to sleep but I was pretty aware that it wasn't withdrawals keeping me up, it was the stress of reality. I used weed to run away from myself and my responsibilities for the past few years and the stress of finally having to face who I am and having to finally grow up just scared me too much. After that one joint though I fell right back in and smoked every day this past week, even though I felt worse and worse each time I lit up.

So here I am, back at square one having to announce I'm quitting all over again, but this time will be the time. I'm not one to believe in signs, but last night my ex texted me after months of debating texting her for help (she's one of the last people I truly trusted and we're on speaking terms). I've been feeling like everyone who used to care about me has forgotten me, but then she sent me a survey for a project she's working on for our old friend group. Literally as I went to type up my message to her, her message pops up. Like I said, I don't believe in signs but if on the off chance that they're real, that was one.

Also, tomorrow (February 26, 2021) is my 25th birthday, an age I've actually been looking forward to for a while since a middle school teacher referred to it as ""the age when you're actually an adult"", and is the 1/4 mark for my goal of living to 100.

Now I‚Äôm 10 days sober and I want to escape back to weed. At least it will numb my anger and shame.,"The weed is a huge reason why I fucked my life down the drain. I spent everything I ever earned on it. Weed is expensive where I‚Äôm from and often you can get poor quality which for me is like not having weed at all so I just go out and spent more money on it until I find good weed. I‚Äôve smoked for half of my life. I‚Äôm now in my early 30‚Äôs and recently quit my decently paid job because I couldn‚Äôt juggle both the demands of work and my addiction. I thought if I quit my job that it would give me space to fix my addiction but I‚Äôm now super down. The realisation that I will probably never gain the strength or momentum to achieve the few things I need in life to be content is hurting me deeply. I have a supportive girlfriend but if she had any sense she would put herself first and move on from me. I went through some childhood trauma and I suppressed it all. I can remember around 16 saying to myself I don‚Äôt care anymore what happens to me and that‚Äôs when I started smoking weed. I can also remember in my early 20‚Äôs saying to myself you are going to regret not taking responsibility for your life and now I‚Äôm here today and in such a darker then imaginable place. I‚Äôm posting this because I‚Äôm probably just looking for attention and i want people to feel sorry for me. I‚Äôm pathetic beyond words. I‚Äôm sorry for anyone who reads this. Weed is the one thing that makes me happy and I wish I could have a smoke right now but the guilt that would overcome me would be painful. Most of the guilt would be from me leaving my girlfriend down and also my therapist. If I didn‚Äôt have them in my life I would have 100% smoked over the last few days. I think I deliberately reject any joy that comes my way and I seek pain especially since giving up weed. It‚Äôs the bad side of me that is doing this because it knows it will get to escape to weed this way. I‚Äôve rambled enough.

Weed swooped in to save me from a tough situation at 17. It really what what I needed to take a healthier step forward. 
I'm 24 now and I'm noticing that in recent years it's really just tearing my life apart. I'm obese and can diet... Unless I'm high and I compulsively binge eat.

 I have really bad lung issues and no insurance so when I smoke I wake up gasping in the night. I've almost lost consciousness and have to hunt for inhalers when I run out and hope someone is kind. 

I take one dab and then I ABSOLUTELY NEED to immediately take 5 more. It's not okay, it's not healthy. My whole life revolves around it. Every issue I try and tackle is made impossible by weed 

I quit for 4 months in 2019 and I was miserable the entire time. The pull never left. I stopped eating for several days at a time. It did NOT get easier with time.. it got harder.  I was constantly miserable. My anger and anxiety lost me friendships. Ive since done over a year of therapy and exercise and practice mindfulness.

I've been trying to go just THREE DAYS sober for 6 months now just to get some sort of start of departure.  I haven't made it past 20 hours. I right now is at 12 and am crying in my bathroom posting this to avoid it. I just don't know what to do. I feel trapped. I don't want to turn to bad habits again to cope with my debilitating anxiety. I want to find a way forward that involved real sobriety. 

My whole house (3 additional adults) smokes pot and I'm in a legal state. I can't just avoid it though I figure that would be easier. I just had my roommate slap me so I wouldn't go into the other room and smoke. That's not working either! Every time I dab I scream in my head ""wow, you were able to breathe just fine a few minutes ago, now you're gasping. Do you need to go count how many puffs you have left?? Do you feel any better than you did? No. ""

People laugh at me when I tell them I'm addicted and it's taken over my life. My dad went to rehab for pot but still smokes and lost 2 jobs over it.

I quit with my wife on New Year's and relapsed on day 3 by telling ourselves we could use our time lock metal safe to force us to moderate (we've tried KSafes in the past but they never last more than a day or two before we take a hammer to it...).

And, until a couple of weeks ago, this worked! We successfully cut back to smoking 3-4 times a week, and then only in the evenings. I started working out again, meditating, journaling, studying. I felt absolutely great that I could enjoy something I truly loved without overdoing it.

But a couple of weeks ago disaster struck. My wife was out of town for the day and even though our bud was locked away that day, I had a *very* strong urge to just take the day for myself, smoke and veg out. I learned about ""bouncing"" safes and tried it on ours... And it worked.

There is no putting the genie back in the bottle. The metal safe is now as useless for us as the plastic Ksafe. Worse even, since we didn't have to break it to open it.

We recently moved so our only two plugs are either making a five hour round trip to a legal state, where it's more expensive and lower quality (not to mention the time and gas wasted) or hitting up our new neighbors who also smoke. The problem with the latter is I don't want these new people, who seem extremely cool, to see us for the addicts we are. I didn't mind (that much) constantly hitting up our old dealer whenever we ran out, but I don't want that with our neighbors.

All that to say, I feel like I'm starting to accept I simply cannot have any weed again for a long, long time, if ever.

I feel very sad at this fact. I do truly love weed. But I also feel a little hopeful. It will be a lot harder for my addict brain to trick me now. The longest break I've taken in the past five years is 12 days. Time to set some new records.",18,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.37250555}"

I've realized how much it affects me in this sense. I literally have no motivation to talk to anybody if I spend my free time high. I get nothing from it. 

But it's important to socialize and be connected with others to stay sober. I was talking to a guy from my class before, and while it was a bit awkward, it actually felt good to talk to someone. 

This is my path to stay sober, maybe most can't relate, but to me it's a struggle cause it's something that I need to do but it requires extra effort. 

Also most of my old friends are potheads/ drug addicts and they don't respect my sobriety too much. So we've grown apart. And I've become isolated. 

So I guess now it's time to work on building relationships. I'll do whatever it takes to stay sober, and maybe this helps. 

Maybe other introverts can relate.",11,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44560888}"

My plan is to completely stop at the end of February so since January I‚Äôve just been smoking with my uncle every 1-2 weeks. At first it was hard because I was so used to smoking to cure my boredom, so I found myself being extremely bored to the point where I didn‚Äôt want to do anything except stare at a wall. So since the new year I‚Äôve just been smoking maybe once every 1 or 2 weeks. This has made it a lot easier than just straight up stopping, gradually is the way to go for me. 

The reason I decided to stop is because I wanted a clear head for college because My class starts in September. Smoking never really affected me like that but I just wanted to stop to make sure I was staying on top of eveyrhing and not wasting my time and money. Smoking once every week or two has been amazing though, tolerance is super low so I‚Äôm getting shmacked every single time, to the point where I have 0 memory of certain points in the night. And even after I leave my uncles, I don‚Äôt have any cravings, I don‚Äôt feel like I need to smoke to keep myself from being bored either. Occasionally I‚Äôll want a joint just because it‚Äôs been a long stressful day and I just want to relax. But other than that, these past 2 months have been pretty easy for me to stop. And if you can, don‚Äôt give yourself the option to buy weed. Delete your plugs, do soemthing. Personally I‚Äôm just too lazy to drive 30 minutes there and back for some weed, so that was a big help.

I feel like there's an entire personality in me that's a fiend, it's always there asleep right up until I'm about to run out. Waking just to tell me that I'm running out, that I should go and get some more. He doesn't shut up about it until I'm on my way to get more. Now that I've decided to quit, it's constantly awake nagging at me at every moment. Trying to make plans to get more, or making me think that there's this hole in myself that smoke would fill. 
That's ridiculous! All of it is ridiculous! I may personify it as someone different but this fiend is myself and I feel ridiculous becoming addicted to something that isn't addictive physically but holy shit I'd argue you up into the corner of a room telling you that it's sure as shit mentally addictive. Otherwise I wouldn't be fighting myself for having a smokeless day. The thought of a smokeless month seems like a far off dream.
For now I've put up everything that reminds me of smoking in a cabinet. And I clean and exercise every time I think ""We should get some more."". It's times like this, that I'm at least really really grateful I never tried hard drugs. If I did, I know that I would be dead by this point. 
So Leaves, have you ever experienced something like this? A version of you that always plays backseat to your habit, spurning you on to continue it even though you yourself feels like you're done? 
I just need to talk because I have bills coming up but the fiend wants me to buy first and deal with which bills to pay and which ones to be late on.

When I do finally fall asleep, I'm having these crazy vivid dreams. Smoking helped me to tune everything out, including my dreams and my thoughts. Now, it's like I finally have to face all that I've been avoiding. It's hard... especially when most all of your friends smoke, your boyfriend smokes, your sister, brother, cousins smoke.

I‚Äôve decided to quit smoking weed. What once was a fun endeavor with friends turned into self medicating and escaping responsibilities. 

I started smoking towards the end of my sophomore year of college which was in March 2018. I had gone over a buddies house and had just gotten out of a relationship (2 years, if that matters) and he passed me a big, glass piece otherwise known as a bong. He gave me the greens and said, ‚ÄúHere, I know this will help you. Just pack it in, rip it, and let go when you‚Äôre ready to blast off‚Äù I was so stoked and then, I was stoked. The blast off was something I‚Äôve never felt from a substance (I used to smoke nicotine but quit that a couple years ago) It was euphoric. 

A little bit about me: I‚Äôm a small town kid that comes from very conservative parents whom only want to see me succeed in whatever endeavor I put myself in. 

Anyways, summer of 2018, I spent every afternoon (I worked from 8-3) smoking with my friends, exploring unknown, rural areas while stoned, and of course, eating out bc of the munchies. I was still fairly new to smoking and actually felt guilty due to the conservative notion of ‚Äòdrugs being bad‚Äô. As usual, I shrugged it off. I thought to myself ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just a plant. Plus, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm doing crack or meth.‚Äô 

Then when it was time to go back to school, I met a couple of buddies whom also enjoyed Mary Jane. We would smoke in my dorm before classes started, show up to class absolutely fried out of our minds, and then smoked after class. This ritual was so consistent that at some point our professor stopped giving us the side eye and just got used to the four of us reeking up the room. We weren‚Äôt bad students. We still participated but have you ever heard stoners try to answer questions? Not the best idea either.

Fast forward a little to 2019: I‚Äôm still smoking but everyone around me is taking a tolerance break. So, instead of joining them in a tolerance break... guess what I do? I UP the smoking. There was multiple weekends in one month where I blew through an ounce with ease. I started out smoking my friends and it felt like a competition when it shouldn‚Äôt have been. By this time, I‚Äôm a junior about to be a senior. Although my grades weren‚Äôt doing too bad, they also weren‚Äôt doing too great but I wasn‚Äôt really focused on my grades and academics but more so smoking and self medicating. The reason I started self medicating was because of the break up but I masked it as ‚Äòthis is just for fun‚Äô but, I guess you can say, subconsciously I was really hurt. In spring of 2019, my ex girlfriend and I managed to work things out. She said she didn‚Äôt like me to smoke but that it was okay that I did, and so after hearing the green light, I kept on since I was happy about having her back. You would think that I would stop since I got her back? Nope. The way I saw it was ‚ÄòAw, fuck yeah, we‚Äôre back in each other‚Äôs lives and I get to dance with Mary? This is fucking great.‚Äô Eventually, ex girlfriend moves in with me. I‚Äôm still smoking, interning, everything you do once college is about to be over and you‚Äôre about enter the real world. 

Anyways, mid-pandemic, so towards the end of March 2020, my ex girlfriend and I split. She grabs all her belongings and leaves. (No it wasn‚Äôt weed related) And this, this is where it got severe. The moment she left, I grieved. It hurt as if someone died. One of my immediate reactions was, ‚ÄòWell... time to get high‚Äô I didn‚Äôt even stop to consider or tell myself that smoking wasn‚Äôt the best coping mechanism but since I had done it prior when we broke up two years ago, I said fuck it.

It‚Äôs about to be a year since the the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô break up. Yesterday, I decided to take my last toke. Reasons why I‚Äôm quitting: I‚Äôm self medicating (this is a big one). There‚Äôs a delayed reaction in my response time. I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve been stuttering more and my reading level has gone down. My memory is bogged and can‚Äôt really remember much. I‚Äôve just started an entry level position and want to excel in it. I feel emotionally unstable, as if I don‚Äôt know how to control my emotions. And, I‚Äôm just ready to refocus and prioritize my goals again. 

I‚Äôm not sure how difficult or thought this journey of weed sobriety will be but what once started due to a breakup must end with a break up (with Mary Jane). I was hooked on nicotine before and
managed just fine with the withdrawals, so I hope it‚Äôll be the same with weed. 

Anyways, thank you guys for taking the time to read this. If anyone has comments, concerns, or questions, feel free to drop them down below. I‚Äôm really just here to support and feel supported.

I felt strong in the morning, and took a vigorous walk and felt so good. But mid-morning a craving snuck up on me, and by 11am I was convinced I had to smoke (conveniently, that's the time my local dispensary opens). Without any self-reflection, I bought a bag and got high. The high felt so-so, not terrible but nothing great. A few hours later I was feeling antsy again, so had a second sesh. I could see clearly that I was headed back towards all-day every-day abuse, and after a few tokes I flushed the bag.

So today is Day 1 again. I am really disappointed in myself. I was feeling so good about myself, and loved being clean. During the last week I'd managed to fend off some pretty strong cravings, and thought I had a handle on things. But yesterday's craving just floored me, and I acted on it before thinking it through.

One of the tricksy aspects of the craving was how I told myself I would get my work done better if I was high. I have a project at work that I haven't been super motivated to work on during the last few days, but I told myself that after getting high I would work on it. Well I did, for a couple of hours, but then got distracted and bored, and didn't feel like working on it any more. Trouble is, the project needs about 10 hours of focused work, not just 2. I realized a few years ago that weed does not make me more productive or creative at work, after many years of telling myself that it did. My cravings yesterday lied to me that weed would help me do my work, and I accepted it without question.

Now it's the middle of the night and I can't sleep (after 11 days clean I had begun sleeping pretty well, and had recently started dreaming again). I feel like shit, and I'm crying. But I'll pick myself up, dust myself off, and start again. Hopefully a little wiser this time, and better able to resist the cravings.

Then I'd walk smoking, passing dog walkers and having to face the shame that I was using at 8am on a week day. I don't miss that.

I don't miss driving with my stash box in my car, stoned, and the feeling of driving in front of the police. Feeling like one wrong move and it comes crashing down. I'd get roadside tested, have to tell my parents & my friends why I couldn't drive my car for a year. Not be able to drive to my job anymore and risk losing it. And what if I seriously injured someone in an accident? I'd never get over the shame.

Another thing I don't miss: smoking and with every breath knowing I am inhaling carcinogens, and I had been doing so for years. I have health anxiety so please could people not talk about the C-word in the comments. I'm learning to deal with my health anxiety without the numbing of drugs and it's a learning curve.

Lastly, all the social shit I let slide; if someone upset me, I'd ruminate over it, turning their words over and over in mind. I'd struggle to address it with the person so I'd go home and smoke a joint. Once I was high, the pain had softened, so I felt no need to address it. Only thing is, this shit doesn't go away. People learn that it's ok to be rude to you, or screw you over because you won't do anything about it- you teach people how to treat you.

 Now I'm sober I'm left wondering if I could have handled things differently at work places (In and out of lots of jobs in the last 6 years) and had a secure job. I'm also wondering if I would have stayed in my fucked up relationship for so long if I wasn't smoking away the pain. It's over now, but not before I experienced a world of hurt.

I've started attending NA meetings, they are phenomenal. They have this phrase: ""facing life on life's terms"". To me, right now, it means it's good to be angry when someone hurts you, it's good to take action. It's good to feel anxious about not having a job, take that energy and turn it into a job search, spend the morning working on applications. Where previously, I'd have felt uncomfortable and tried to mask those feelings by getting high, I'm putting actions into place that ease that discomfort permanently.

I wanted to share my experience of freeing myself from my marijuana addiction.  But first some background on me. 


I was one of those rare cases that wasn‚Äôt able to get stoned when I first tried.  I grew up in the UK, and at that time the only cannabis available was in hash form.  


I was already a regular drinker by age 16; as were my friends.  I was up for anything that got me wasted.  Mushrooms, coke, speed, valium, even huffing aerosol cans; whatever I could get my hands on.  (Alcohol was the easiest to obtain of course). 


Our parents all smoked, so it was easy to steal a little dope for ourselves.  But try as I might, I could not catch a buzz.  


I invested heavily in alcohol abuse and was well on the road to alcoholism by age 20.  A year later I moved to the US and smoked my first weed joint.   Holy shit!!  You guys know the deal. I finally understood and I loved it.  I quickly became a daily smoker.  


Over the next 25 years my decent into alcoholism was sealed.  I took a break from daily drinking for awhile because I discovered ecstasy, and the alcohol messed with the high. But through it all I was never without weed.  And if I was out, I‚Äôd move mountains to make sure I got some more. 


At 42, with the help of AA, I stopped drinking.  I didn‚Äôt want to quit but alcohol was literally killing me.  My sponsor urged me to quit smoking and zig manage a day or two periodically. But I always fell back into daily smoking again real quick.    


My smoking increased.  I was hitting 7 fat blunts a day.  If I wasn‚Äôt smoking I was thinking about it. My workdays were a chore to get through with my thoughts focused on that first glorious smoke of the day waiting for me.  Often I would bust out of work at 5pm on the dot and immediately light up a pipe in the stairwell of my NYC office building.  A ridiculous risk.  


Fast forward 3 years and things are bad.  I can no longer get high for more than 5-10 minutes, no matter how much I smoke.  I‚Äôm paranoid throughout the day about random stuff.  My temper was raw and on a hair trigger.  
Every night I would put my kids to bed, wait for my wife to fall asleep and then go down to the basement where I would work on my hobbies and smoke nonstop until 3am. 


I‚Äôd often pass out in my chair and come to around sunrise.  Exhausted beyond belief.  


I was spending $700 or more on weed a month that I didn‚Äôt have.  My debts were growing and still I borrowed more.  As soon as my stash got low I became anxious.   Whole days and nights would be wasted obsessively calling dealers trying to score before I ran out.  If I was unsuccessful I would pathetically scrape bowls and pull tar out of pipe tubes to make savage blunts that bordered on toxic. 
My lungs were so burnt I‚Äôd cough till I was red in the face and then take another hit.  


5 years ago, on feb 17th, I was again in a panic because I had run out.  I couldn‚Äôt reach a dealer and I didn‚Äôt know how I was going to pay for more even if I found some.   I was sitting in my gorgeous house, with my sweet family upstairs.  I was so blessed compared to so many.  I had a job, great friends, plenty of toys and I was hiding out in misery spending more time up in my head than out in the real world being present.  


An idea floated up from somewhere deep within me.  ‚ÄúWhat if I simply don‚Äôt buy anymore and see what happens?‚Äù


If I managed to score and smoke I knew exactly what to expect.  But I had no idea what would happen if I pushed through the early days of withdrawal and really gave sobriety a try.  


My family and I were leaving in 4 days for vacation.  What a perfect opportunity to get clean, I thought. I can rest and swim and not be bogged down with responsibilities.  


So I did it.  The first few days are always the toughest.  I wasn‚Äôt sleeping well.  I had night sweats that would soak my pillow and bedsheets. I had to get up in the night and lay towels down to sleep on.  My appetite was all messed up.  


But a funny thing happened.  The small amount of sleep I did get felt really good.  And I began to dream again.  Crazy colorful dreams.  
I started waiting for the grey light of dawn to show and I‚Äôd get up to watch the sunrise.   (A practice I continued for several months.) 


We took our vacation and it was bliss.  I would get up before the sun, grab a coffee and my guitar.  Then I would play on the cliffs overlooking the beach while the sun came up.  I felt such peace and gratitude and I had no craving to smoke.  


By the time we returned home my resolve was set. I was starting to sleep more naturally.  Being stoned changes how we sleep.  It doesn‚Äôt allow us to sink into that regenerative REM state we desperately need.  I was rested and full of energy.  


I got laid off and quickly found a new job with great prospects. I started acting on all the bucket list things I used to dream about doing while I was high.    I got involved in volunteer work through AA and worked my 12 step program harder than ever.   


The ways my life has improved are too numerous to list.  And I‚Äôve rambled for a long time now.    I‚Äôll close with this: I never ever have the desire to smoke.  You could not pay me enough to take a bong it.   I can be around people who are smoking and not be tempted.  He‚Äôll, I even occasionally roll joints for my wife and I‚Äôm not tempted at all.   


Breaking the weed addiction cycle is hard.  But nowhere as hard as you think once you get past a certain point.  If this old pot head can do it so can you.

2017 - started smoking multiple pipes a day. With only a few days without. Basically got hooked right away.
2018 - still daily smoker. Barely any days off. Maybe once for 2 weeks because of visiting family.

2019 - multiple joints per day

2020 - gradually went from multiple joint per day to only 1 joint a day, then to half a joint each night. During the last quarter of 2020 I made the conscious decision that I had to quit this bad habit for good. Had some breaks not lasting longer than 7 days. 

Jan 2021 - quit for 3 days, then caved, then quit and caved again, then quit a couple days then caved again. 

Feb 2021 - first 7 days clean, then i caved in for 4 days and now i‚Äôm on day 13. And I honestly believe i‚Äôm done for good. 

I went from not being able to eat, sleep or be happy without smoking to now eating and sleeping by myself. My mood has improved significantly! I‚Äôm more happy and appreciative of life. My skin is looking way better! Which is a big motivator to keep going lol

I did wake up with a major headache this morning though that lasted all day. My sinuses feel fucked up. This started maybe 4 days ago.

My throat no longer feels like a penny! I can finally eat big meals. I had a whole trout the other day, I even ate a bunch of salad with it.

Throat also feels very clean. No spitting green stuff all day. 

While ditching weed I‚Äôve also decided to focus on my much ignored oral hygiene. The damage is done and the dentist did talk shit and act like my whole life is over but I understand that‚Äôs 90 percent of their job anyways. So I‚Äôve taken up flossing and brushing on a consistent basis. My gums and mouth colour look pink now, compared to red previously. I recommend getting a thorough cleaning as it did feel like my mouth got a lot easier to brush. 

To bring my mood up I‚Äôve also booked an eye exam to get a new prescription, some new glasses will be a nice touch and hopefully get me to go on walks more often which will help my mood. Since sunlight helps appearently. 

I‚Äôve had a busy and stressful week. Unfortunately quitting hasn‚Äôt brought my motivation back. I‚Äôm still feeling like everything is a chore but that might be the endless snow, the rona lockdown and stress from general life. 

As the weed fades, I feel a depression setting. I remember now that I smoked because of depressive thoughts and it beats popping pills, what I hate more than a drug addiction is a pill addiction.

So here I am trying to figure out how to beat the depression. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs there, I love to read news all day and that is built around selling fear.

I know it's pointless to think about, but I often catch myself wondering where I would be if I never started smoking.

Like most of us, I started smoking HEAVILY when quarantine hit last March. I would sneak outside smoke as fast as I could and go back to my house paranoid that someone would catch me. This sequence repeated for two months until I started to get hit with some of the side effects we all know. The brain fog settled in, I  started to push away my friends, and my mental health took a dive. I knew this drug didn't belong in my life but every time I told myself I'd quit, the next day I was sparking up a joint. Fast forward nine months and I'm in the exact same spot. That's what weed does to you. It keeps you complacent. It kills your ambition. For the past year, I have chosen instant gratification over working on things that will truly make me happy. I don't want to waste another day being a slave to addiction. I want to feel real happiness. Today is Day 1 for me.

About a month before quarantine. Throughout the quarantine as spring was making its debut I began to feel again. I saw the colors of life begin to pour into my soul for the first time in ages. It was a wonderful time. I had a great quarantine just by my lonesome seeing life through a new lens.

Until my birthday mid may. I decided I‚Äôd let myself have a smoke. By the end of the summer I was completely back to square one in the weed fog. Hopeless. I kept stopping for about a week or so and then smoking non stop for a week or so. You know the cycle. I was stuck again and I needed an awakening. 

When I had quit smoking in quarantine my passion to move my life to NYC came back after all these years. My goal was to make the move in the fall until I fell back into the weed rut and it once again became a distant thought. 

However underneath the weed fog a part of me was still pushing for the move, and God made it possible for me. I went through with the move in mid December still smoking like a freight train. I was so ready to quit and knew that this move would help. I‚Äôd have no one to buy from and no one to smoke with... I‚Äôm so glad I made the move. The fog is starting to lift from my eyes again. The colors are coming back. It‚Äôs like last year but in an entirely new world. I go out every day just to walk and I‚Äôm almost moved to tears by all the emotions I‚Äôm starting to feel and how truly present I am. I feel like I‚Äôm in a dream but a REAL dream. 

New opportunities are beginning to present themselves to me slowly but surely. Weed has no place in my future. Even the thought of it repulses me. I went home about a month ago and ended up smoking with an old friend. It just reminded me how done I am with weed.

When I was a pill addict I pushed people away from me, I endangered my health and the health of people around me, I was in an abyss where i was too shot out to feel depressed,or honestly, feel anything. The people around me were hurt and couldn‚Äôt bare to see me slowly killing myself. And i never thought it was problematic cause I was getting good grades, making money, and ‚Äúdoing what i needed to do‚Äù. Until I had a drug induced seizure. 

If you feel like you‚Äôve hit rock bottom, trust me you haven‚Äôt. Just being here means you want to get better and improve your life. And that‚Äôs step 1. Real, hardcore, DGAF, drug addicts do not try to get better. They won‚Äôt stop until they‚Äôre gone. Or until they‚Äôve lost literally everything and, even then, many will keep on going. 

Stay positive everyone. Life is cruel, unfair, a marathon of bullshit. But it‚Äôs also so beautiful if you find the beauty in it. Easier said than done, but it‚Äôs done one moment, one hour, and one day at a time.

So here's my issue/problem. I'm not convinced I want to actually do the 12 steps as they involve taking leaps of mental faith I don't necessarily vibe with, as in I would have to accept things that go against my inner truth/gut feelings to do them well (such as admitting I'm powerless, focusing on and labelling ""character defects"" ect.). 

However, I recognise besides this the 12 steps involve a lot of inner work that can be helpful to any human being. Therefore, I AM interested in doing this work to better myself. 

So...my question is, do any of you know any alternative programs/methods to embarking on this inner development work? I'm sure I could read tons of related self-help books on the subject but that just sounds a little messy and not so straight forward. I don't know guys, ideas?!?!

Just to preface, this is an emotionally-fueled ramble so if anyone can extract any sense from what I say and give me some advice i'd be eternally grateful.

I've reached that point in my addiction where the signs are beginning to try and tell me to stop. I'm in my last year of university, hopefully going to graduate into a professional sector job so the next few months are probably going to be very important to me - exams and interviews etc. I wouldn't say I'm a heavy smoker; only about a gram a day, but definitely a habitual smoker. After my lectures for the day are done, or before I make dinner I'll go for a joint - I live alone with my weed so there's nothing stopping me. I'm a fairly skinny guy (145lb at 6"") and my appetite was never the best before I started smoking - so that's my biggest concern, I've had a few experiences of not smoking for a couple days and wanting to throw up at the sight of food. I'm fairly aware of the common advice that people give to curb smoking but i'll graciously take any given.

I'd been thinking about it in the background for a while but decided that today is the day I would write this post and share (hopefully) the beginning of my story. I've got my last gram twisted up for tonight to bid farewell to mary, hopefully I can enjoy it knowing it will be my last.

Day 6. 

So this may be common knowledge, but did anyone know how strong nicotine is as a stimulant? I did not.

I've tried to quit cannabis a few times in the past. When I'm smoking weed, I very rarely smoke pure tobacco. But I am addicted to nicotine and usually get my hit from joints.

So when I have tried to quit weed, I start smoking wayyyy more cigarettes to suppress my cravings for a joint. Instead of having a joint just before bed, I'd have a cig instead.

So the first few nights I did this, I had a very restless nights sleep and struggled to even get to sleep for hours on end. I did some research into it and discovered how strong of a stimulant nicotine actually is. 

The last two nights, I had my last cigarette 3 hours before planning to sleep, and I've fell asleep with ease both nights, without waking up constantly.

If you are struggling to sleep, I'd highly suggest trying to drop nicotine before bed. I can't believe the difference in my rest the past 2 nights.

On a side note, the headaches have started. I thought I was over the worst but the feeling of being stabbed behind the eyes constantly is winding me right up. Anyone know any tips to try and minimise this? I've been drinking plenty of water, and don't want to resort to taking pain killers.

Good luck to everyone.

This bit i wrote yesterday as a comment but i think its a good read to anyone who's hella stressed or anxious with sleep and apetite issues. So here goes :


Hey hey, been going through similar things, but i cant really put a finger onto whats doing what. I had a panic attack or something similar that shook me like ive never been shook before, the cause of this i think was that i didnt eat anything normal that day apart from drinking coffe, eating loads of sugars/chocolate +  like 4-5 diet cokes that day, it happened when i was laying in bed right about to sleep and a thought entered my head and it was me thinking about me beeing 23 years old and realising i had lived half of my dads life. Got scared and realised that im grinding away for no reason and life is short. Thats not the real me though and i knew that, but despite the fact i couldnt shake off the thought even the next few days. Today is i think my 4th day without weed, also waking up every few hours in swets, anxiety is through the roof, i even started thinking i have problems with liver and shit like that, but i think its just the result of quitting 3 substances at once. Diet plays a big role, i cant drink coffee now that i know it just stresses you out and gives you anxiety.

Today in the morning i decided to work out a bit in my garden, i took all my eqp outside and started benching, deadlifting and squatting, ive definetly gotten weaker and my heart was beating weirdly too, but i assume that was the sugar drop in my blood since past few days i didnt have anything sugary cuz my apetite is absolutely destroyed.
 But hey, tommorow will be better, i hope ur not really sick, and i hope im not too lol.
Also im shaking alot, even when its not really cold, i cried the second day after quitting, depression kicked in like never before, but the best thing that helped me the most i think is just going for walks, and talking really openly to close friends and letting them know how you feel, why you feel like so, and allowing them to help you. 

Even the smallest encouragements felt like a good boost kick up the butt helping me realise that this shitty season of my life will pass and everything is going to be okey.

Im a super positive person, but this... this fkin withdrawal has been just the worst. Both phisicaly and mentaly crushing.

Also today im feeling pretty fkin good, had best sleep today compared to the 4 days prior. Eesh... dont even want to remember how i felt back then, and this only motivates me more to not take part in this recreational activity.

All love, patience, you are not alone, dm me for support if needed as only at this hard time i finaly understood the importance of other people, and how just the smallest phrase like ""no worries mate its all in ur head"" can help calm down so much.

I‚Äôve been smoking on and off since 16 years old, but been smoking continuously since I was 20. I‚Äôm 24 now. I‚Äôve considered quitting before, but this time my mom asked me to stop. 

The problem is, I smoke -weed, cigs, puffbars- whenever I feel intense. I‚Äôve been told by others, while being sober, that I‚Äôm a lot; which I know I‚Äôve internalized those comments. Being high made me calm and so it became my secret. 

I keep going back and fourth trying to explain or excuse why I‚Äôve smoked for so long. I‚Äôm not even sure I want to quit smoking, but I can feel my body asking me too. Yet my body also asks for it. I‚Äôll feel anxious. My hands will shake. The idea of doing it spins around in my head because deep down I enjoyed it.

But now that I‚Äôm older, I can see how being high has impacted other areas of my life. I‚Äôm not learning as much as I could in school. I get so lost in my thoughts I forget about things I wanted to do. I‚Äôll chose chilling back over working or going out. Sometimes I get so paranoid I don‚Äôt want to talk to others. Other times I‚Äôm so energetic I feel like I‚Äôm having a manic episode. I want to quit only because I want to succeed in other parts of my life. 

I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs last statement is valid. I feel lost, unsure if I‚Äôm addicted or I‚Äôm just that guy walking around faintly smelling of pot. I spent a portion of the day looking for instant gratification in other places. I hit up a buddy for sex. I smoked some cigs. I ate cake. I was cranky the whole time. I feel better now, or at least just glad that I ‚Äúaccomplished‚Äù not smoking weed. 

I‚Äôd like to ask for some support. Can anyone relate to this? Does anyone have some advice for the crankiness? How did you get over the cravings? Is it okay to not regret it? 

P.s. pls don‚Äôt recommend a therapist, my therapist recommended I‚Äôd talk to others about this.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46067595}"

I started smoking 3 years ago (I‚Äôm 21 and a senior in college). I have never ever had cravings during the day. I‚Äôm studious as hell and have been getting good grades throughout college. Only at night, around 10:30 pm onward is when I crave. Started with just smoking with some buddies on my floor in my dorm at night and it was more of a social thing and I really wanted to make friends freshman year. This turned into me smoking only at night before I went to bed, at home and at college. Volume was never a huge issue either, I‚Äôd usually just take 1 bong rip or rip a cart a few times, watch something in bed, knock. Pretty much everyday though... was a good way to wind down or forget my worries of the day (or so I thought... :/ ) 

So now I‚Äôm here, sober, but I‚Äôve been having a TERRIBLE time sleeping last couple nights. Right now I have QUITE the urge, but it‚Äôs only because I wanna sleep. And trust me, I‚Äôve been using melatonin and it hasn‚Äôt helped. I have social anxiety (I‚Äôve known this damn well though 4 years before I started smoking weed) so when I try to meditate or do breathing techniques I can‚Äôt focus and my mind absolutely fucking races at night, so when I‚Äôm sober I really really can‚Äôt sleep. Problem is that my best friend here smokes all the time, and is my dealer so that does not help and we LIVE together. I just wanna take a bong rip and knock out rn and tackle the day tomorrow.

My work has been intense and stressful and I found myself getting overwhelmed and almost getting frantic through the day. At certain points I felt I've never handled this much pressure before - when I've actually been in this job for almost 2 years and it has been like this for quite a bit. 

Made me realize just how little I've actually dealt with the stress and the important stuff, because my normal pattern was so simple - make it through my day of meetings and then get high. Sometimes get high around 2pm if it got bad (like today).   
Once I was high, I didn't remember the stress or anything I had to do. I did the bare minimum I needed to that day and moved on feeling ""great"". ""Let me just get high so I can deal with this""

Only now am I seeing just how little I've done to make my situation better, to learn how to navigate this job and this stress and plan my priorities so I can actually make my life better. 

Getting high keeps you thinking that you are handling your discomfort, your problems - when in reality you are just sitting watching bad TV while your life passes you by.

I don't regret it one bit.,"I've been really wanting to share my story of quitting marijuana for a while and glad I found a place I can do so. I know it's long, but hope it's worth the read.

Everything started one night when my best friend called me up saying his girlfriend had just broken up with him. We were seniors in high school at the time, and I invited him over to spend the night to help my boy out. He came over just like always to spend the night, but this time... this time was different. He brought weed with him, stuff he bought just beforehand... said he needed it to chill out after this whole situation. We only smoked once or twice before this, so this was a big deal at the time. This night is when it started... when we snuck outside and smoked a blunt, came back in, and made a fun time out of nothing, forgetting all of our problems.

Now at this point in time, my friend had moved in with his mom ( parents were divorced ) who used to be a heavy drug user but now consistently smokes pot, which isn't good but thankfully that's it. Since he moved in there, he became a massive stoner, and some of those habits rubbed off on me too. That summer of 2018 right before we went to college, he showed me a dab pen. I was amazed that I could use something that didn't smell, was cheap and easy to use, and would get me MESSED up at anytime I wanted. I immediately got one too, and started getting high every. single. day. For the time I would only do it at nights. At one point we both even started making our own carts... melting wax down with a liquidizer and putting the juice into refillable carts, cheaper and more effective. That summer was when things started to get noticeably different.

In August of 2018, I moved into college for my freshman year. I started out using the dab pen literally any time I wanted since my parents weren't around, and I was high multiple times a day... it was pretty bad. I went to the first lectures for all of my classes and after that started skipping them pretty consistently so that I could get high, eat snacks, and watch youtube. A couple months into freshman year I switched to smoking actual weed rather than dab carts. It became a routine for me every day to pack a bowl. Walk half a mile to a spot on campus I could smoke discretely, smoke, and then walk back to my dorm, buying some snacks along the way. Some days I would roll up a joint for myself, sometimes it would be a blunt, but often it was a little bowl I bought for $10.

Throughout the rest of the year, especially in second semester, it just got progressively worse. I had met a friend, now current housemate, that was also a huge stoner. We had a routine every day. We would go to the gym in the morning, smoke RIGHT after, skip most of our classes, hang out, and then smoke every time the high went down for the rest of the day. At this point in my life I was high for most of the day, every day.

End of Freshman year comes, It's summer 2019, and I'm excited to have no responsibilities for a while. When I get back home, I end up buying myself a huge bong, hiding it in my room. I also get another dab pen, and carts, and some more weed, and smoke myself up a storm all summer. This summer is one that I consider to be wasted... especially since it was my last one before the pandemic. I spent almost EVERY waking moment of that summer high off of my ass. I didn't work, everyday I would just get up, get high, and continue to use my dab pen the whole day until later at night when I could use my bong. If I ever hung out with my friends, we would always get incredibly stoned and do nothing productive. I'm ashamed of how lazy I Was that summer... but it's over now.

Finally whenever that summer ended and I got back to school for sophomore year, I FINALLY started to notice the effects smoking was having on my life. I hadn't worked a real job in over a year, I felt lazy and useless, I wasn't doing well in classes ( not failing but definitely not acceptable to my standards ), I had a VERY tough time talking to people... for some reason I felt that I had just become socially awkward. I even had trouble going to the dining hall at my school because I would just get too anxious to be around other people, and I was barely eating. I wasn't doing good with any girls, I looked like shit, a very patchy beard with a mop on my head and my eyes always red and squinting with dark circles under them. I had made NO progress on my one true passion I'd had for a long time, fitness, specifically weightlifting... my weights hadn't changed. The way I talked was different, I looked different, I felt different... I wasn't myself.

THIS is whenever I realized that weed was ruining my life. I told myself that I'd be done with this bullshit, and would change. I gave ALL of my weed and accessories, bongs, bowls, papers, eyedrops, everything to my friend who was still a stoner and told him I'm done so he can have it all. After that, I picked up some hard classes, did amazing in them, got a new job while taking these classes, reoriented myself around my fitness goals, started going at 6am every morning and saw amazing results once again, ran for a student council president in a big school of 16000 students and won!!! I felt motivated, driven, and happy, like never before. My life changed so much for the better. I started making some new friends, getting closer to friends I already had, got a girlfriend, made professional connections, and everything just went on the up.

It's been about 18 months since then. I'm in my Junior year of college, studying computer science, doing phenomenally. I'm crushing my fitness goals and feel better than ever. I have some close friends and relationships that I never could have even dreamt of having. I have an internship that has a high chance of turning into my full time dream job at the end of the year. I feel closer with my family than ever. I feel like a better role model for my 8 year old nephew who really looks up to me.

I am happy.

I know this is long, and thanks to anyone who reads it. I really just wanted to share my story with others, and hopefully it can help other people quit too.

**EDIT**:

Thank you everyone for your kind words... since most of my friends are heavy stoners I never got much acknowledgement for quitting smoking as an achievement. It really means a lot that there's many others here in the same boat... we're all in this together.

To those of you who are on the journey of quitting: keep it up, you got this! I know that it can be tough at first and nothing seems to stir up much emotion within you at the time... but trust me, everything gets better. The day I knew that quitting was worth it, I was taking a walk at night on my campus, at the top of a hill. I was thinking back to everything that had changed since I quit smoking, and where my life was going, and the control that I had over it now. I looked out while lost in thought, and saw a beautiful view of the city before me, my city. In that moment, I knew that I would never forget this night... I felt real happiness, and honestly couldn't help but just smile.

It can be tough at first and nothing seems to make you feel as happy as weed does, but trust me, eventually you will feel more emotion than ever, and it will be all worth it.",361,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44482768}"

2021-02-23 20:44:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lqzt82/420_days/,420 days,"
I‚Äôve hit a fun milestone, 420 days without cannabis. I started smoking pot in grade school, and continued heavy use into my 30s. I‚Äôve got some health challenges, and I used it to cope with pain and other issues. But I also used it to escape reality and avoid feeling my feelings. Quitting was one of the most difficult personal challenges I‚Äôve encountered (it‚Äôs gotten easier), but the benefits have been phenomenal. I thought I‚Äôd share my approach, and lessons learned along the way.

But first, a warning. If you are planning on quitting, this post may be helpful. But if you already quit and are struggling, you should skip it.. it may make things harder unnecessarily.

I made several previous attempts at quitting and taking breaks without success. The problem was moderation. As soon as it got hard I would start to think ‚Äúdo I really need to quit?.. I‚Äôll just use it in moderation‚Äù

But then I‚Äôd delay moderation too, or flip-flop and think moderation was pointless because I had to quit.

I realized that to succeed at quitting I needed conviction that moderation wouldn‚Äôt work. And to determine if moderation could work, there had to be consequences to failure so that I really tried to make it work.

I also realized that I needed to clearly articulate what I wanted, and why. Rather than jump to ‚ÄúI want to quit‚Äù, I actually dug down deeper. I realized I wanted a relationship with cannabis in which I didn‚Äôt spend time thinking about it, I didn‚Äôt expend willpower resisting cravings, I didn‚Äôt spend a substantial amount of money on it. And I wanted to feel 100% fine without it. It turned out the only way to achieve those goals was to quit completely, but I had to know for sure.

As for why I wanted to change, at first it was because I was tired of being poor and feeling like garbage all the time. But I settled on something more affirming. That cannabis use was keeping me from living my best life. I went into more detail, but that‚Äôs the jist of it.

I then started a list of several different rules which (if I could adhere to them) might meet the criteria I was looking for. For example: only smoking for a 10 min session after 4:20pm, only smoking on Saturdays, only spending a certain amount of money each week, etc. I then started trying them out. Each Sunday I would pick a rule, and run it for 1-2 weeks (starting Monday). I started with the least restrictive rule, and as I failed to adhere to each rule, I would move on to another. Thus, the consequences were pretty significant. I had committed to quitting if moderation didn‚Äôt work, so each set of parameters was my last chance to use cannabis at that level.

I wasn‚Äôt surprised that I failed every rule I made, but the process gave me the conviction I needed to quit. I started this whole process in the fall, so quitting on New Years worked well. I think having a specific deadline was important, but the date was arbitrary.

My preparation included writing my future self a letter to read after a year, reminding me of why I quit. At the time I couldn‚Äôt stomach a commitment longer than that, and I trusted myself to be in a better place to decide after a year. This letter was EXTREMELY helpful in pushing past the one year mark.

I also purged absolutely everything cannabis related. I threw out pipes, rolling papers, vape cartridges. I even threw out a nice pax vaporizer. If you want to give away stuff or sell it, fine. Just get rid of absolutely everything.

On New Year‚Äôs Eve I cleaned my room, smoked my last joint, and went to bed early.

The first week was hellishly difficult, and the first month was miserable. I had horrible insomnia, and was constantly nauseous. My dreams started to come back, but mostly as nightmares. I took the difficulty as evidence of how dependent I had become, and how important it was that I quit.

I found a sugar free gum I liked, and allowed myself an unlimited amount. There were plenty of other things I wanted to work on, like nutrition, exercise, productivity, but I put avoiding cannabis ahead of everything else. I could lay in bed playing video games as long as I didn‚Äôt smoke pot. Eventually I raised my standards, but abstaining from pot is still a top priority.

I journaled the first few months, and I think it was worthwhile.

Personally, I didn‚Äôt lean on social support much. The only family member I told early on said ‚Äúwhy not use it in moderation‚Äù, which wasn‚Äôt helpful. I read a lot of stories here, but didn‚Äôt post. Maybe I‚Äôm wired differently, but I viewed this as a very personal journey. It‚Äôs demoralizing to share your struggles and get no response, and social media just isn‚Äôt very fulfilling at the best of times. Once I started hitting milestones I shared them with some close friends.

I had been spending almost all my money on pot, and the rest on junk I didn‚Äôt need. Since quitting, I‚Äôve saved money, and leveraged it into a significant amount with trading and investing. I now have enough assets to pay off my student loans and have a substantial amount left over.

Once I leveled out from the first month, my health steadily improved. My autonomic nervous system is prone to chaos, and quitting pot was extremely helpful in getting that on track. Training is important for my health too, and I‚Äôm in the best shape of my life thanks to consistent workouts.

My mental clarity has returned. I can remember things, I have more complex and coherent thoughts, I‚Äôm wittier.

My emotional health has drastically improved too. I used to imagine people resented me, or were secretly critical. But now it‚Äôs clear that I was just paranoid and projecting my own shame.

Quitting pot also laid the foundation for a lot of other positive changes. I‚Äôve quit drinking coffee and alcohol. I‚Äôm addressing my porn usage. I‚Äôm more productive.

Also, despite really struggling at the beginning, it has gotten progressively easier. I catch a whiff of the familiar smell, and walk past pot shops and it‚Äôs not a big deal. I‚Äôm just reminded of the positive change I made. I struggled at the one year mark, and during a period of extreme stress, but otherwise I don‚Äôt even think about cannabis anymore. There may eventually be social situations that are tempting, but I‚Äôm not expecting them to be a big deal.

So yeah, quitting pot kinda changed my life. I hope this is helpful for someone, and wish you all the best.",58,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5068964}"

Never making any posts or comments. It's been very helpful but I think I ought involve myself a bit more to create some external accountability and find support.

So I'm trying to quit again, and I have managed in the past. I'm not what you would consider a heavy smoker, though I did smoke much more a few years back and pulled myself out of that. But I tend to shift to another substance or vice when I quit one like many other people do. This year I've quit drinking as well. So I've fallen back to smoking even though I personally don't react well to thc. Despite not liking the side effects I have smoked on and off for about 7 years. Always ending back where I'm not happy. But knowing the weed creates a short term getaway.

I will find the conviction to quit, then days later that fades. Like I said reading this subreddit has helped a lot. Writing down my thoughts helps as well. (although there are times where I feel the need to write about the negative feelings I get from the high but since I'm high I don't want to focus on articulating though feelings)

Fitness is very important for me when it comes to kicking the habit, gyms are still closed where I live but I'm lucky enough to have some weights at home so I don't have an excuse. I've just slipped from working out regularly and I know getting back into the habit is the key to managing my cravings.

So for a little accountability I hope to return to this post in a matter of weeks and be able to say I've not smoked since.

Thank you for listening.

2021-02-23 19:02:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lqxd3o/my_story_with_weed_addiction/,My story with Weed Addiction,"Hey guys. Today is my first day reading from this subreddit, and I wanted to let you all know how encouraging reading your stories and comments has been for me. I was actually directed here by googling to find some help/guidance in quitting smoking pot, and I wound up here. I‚Äôve been reading from this subreddit all morning now haha!

I'm a long-time smoker who's coming up on 8 years of smoking weed, most of that time spent smoking every day. I didn't start out as a heavy smoker, but I definitely made my way there over a few years. I wanted to share with you (not that it's particularly exciting or crazy), and I am doing this with hopes that it might inspire someone in a similar spot to start their journey towards sobriety, too.

So let's get into it, shall we?

My first experience with pot was when I was studying abroad in Germany at age 16. My host-brother was a pot smoker. I noticed early in my stay that he was sneaking off most days to do something, but my child-like innocence couldn't figure out what, nor did I really care to ask. After about a week of me staying with him, however, he offered me the chance to smoke a joint with him and a couple of his friends. I did not want to appear rude, so I accepted. I don't remember much about the joint itself, but I do remember than I wasn't super fond of the taste, and his friends were very surprised at the size of the hits I was taking. After we finished the joint, we all went inside and proceeded to do stereotypical-stoner activities like listening to music and watching bad TV. I could tell everyone else was feeling particularly stoned and silly, but all I felt was tired and maybe a little confused. I passed out on the couch maybe 30 minutes later. 

When I returned home a few weeks later, I never really thought about my experience with weed in Germany (since it wasn't really a good or bad one), so I never thought to seek it out here in the states.

Fast forward to age 18 and I'm at college in small-town in Iowa, several hours away from my friends and family back home. I'm just learning to enjoy what it feels like to live on my own, but I'm also desperate to meet new friends as I'm in an unfamiliar town all alone. Thankfully, because of my job on campus, I'm able to meet some new friends very quickly, and we all hit it off really well. They were like-minded and honest individuals, and we became swift friends - good enough that I still keep up with them today! 

The one catch: They all smoked weed. 

Needless to say it wasn‚Äôt long before I tried smoking pot once again‚Ä¶ Except this time I LOVED IT. Me and these guys would go hide in parking lots or drive around town and get stupid high, then come back to the cafeteria to feast, or go play video games in one of our dorms. It was a real game-changer for me, as I had never truly ‚Äúgotten high‚Äù before I started smoking with these guys. While I was relishing in the wonderful highs, however, the drawbacks of my new habit were both apparent and severe. Up until this point in my life, I had been a pretty average student, scoring mostly B‚Äôs and taking a few advanced courses here and there. But by the end of my second semester of college, I was failing 2 of my 4 classes. I ended up dropping out of school and moving back in with my parents shortly after.

Once I was back home, my priorities shifted a bit for the better. I now had some hefty student debt to pay off, with minimal skills from not finishing college, so I got a job at a nearby factory. The job was long hours of laborious work for modest pay, something I could handle. Upon my hiring, I was told that the company performs random drug tests, so I knew that I‚Äôd have to take a break from weed. I didn‚Äôt know anybody to get weed from in my hometown anyways, so it wasn‚Äôt too difficult for me to quit at that time. Little did I know, this was my first official ‚ÄúT-break,‚Äù and looking back, probably the longest I‚Äôve ever taken, lasting only about 2 months. 

After a couple of months at my new factory job I was getting pretty chummy with the guys I worked with, when one of them let it slip that he smokes weed. I asked him about the company‚Äôs drug test policy and whether or not he was concerned, and he told me that they have NEVER tested their employees and that it is mostly a formality. Whether or not that was true, it was enough for me. Within the week I was buying and smoking weed again from/with that coworker. 

Here begins what I‚Äôve heard other folks on here refer to as the ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù effect.

I spent the next few years coasting through a variety of jobs and apartments, making enough money to get buy and to keep my smoking (and now drinking) habits going, but with not much else to show for it. Around the time of my 21st birthday, I had the grand idea to move to a legal state, so that I could continue my pot habit without fear of being imprisoned or fined. So I did exactly that. I spent the better half of that year working two jobs and saving money so that I could afford to move to Washington State.

Thankfully, I did accomplish my goal and was able to move to WA before the end of the year, however, my plans for the move were far from perfect. Within the first month, I spent almost all my cash on legalized weed, and since I was smoking all day every day, I made little to no progress on finding a job or housing either. This just ramped up until I actually became homeless about a month later, living entirely out of my car, spending money that wasn‚Äôt mine on credit cards, and doing dabs all the while. Through some perseverance and some good luck, I was able to find a stable place to live and a decent job to support myself, and thus my ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù was able to resume its course. Here began my stoniest phase, where I was able to get high everyday in my own home with nothing and nobody stopping me.

That was over 4 years ago now. Today, I am 26 years old, living in a decent house Washington, working a job that I don‚Äôt hate, and smoking weed and playing video games are still my primary pastimes. Obviously my journey with weed didn‚Äôt start here, but I think moving to a legal state only enabled my addiction, and once I was here is when it truly got bad for me. When I moved to WA, I started smoking mostly dabs, and I think the effects show. Compared to the story above, the last few years of my life feel like a blur. Like they barely even happened ‚Äì like I‚Äôve been on autopilot for 4 years.

It‚Äôs hard to be proud of my accomplishments because, deep down, I feel like I should be so much further in my life. It feels like there were challenges that I skipped, lessons that I missed, people that I didn‚Äôt meet, and even dreams that I never dreamed. I feel there was so much growth and opportunity that I missed, and it‚Äôs hard to find anything to blame it on anything other than my addiction to weed. 

All in all, I‚Äôm definitely happy with where I‚Äôm at today. But, the thought of where I COULD be today will always haunt me. 

I hope in some sense that my story will be inspiring to you, but really, I‚Äôm finding as I write this that telling this story is more for myself than anybody else. I want to quit, and I want to start today. The more I look at it, the more it feels like I should have started years and years ago. I‚Äôm already craving that first dab when I get home‚Ä¶ 

Anyways, here‚Äôs to day 1 my new friends. I hope your journey(s) go smoothly, and that you can accomplish your goals in the end.  <3",16,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48851126}"

My point being that we live in a very disconnected world where we often aren‚Äôt 100% present in our literal physical reality. And my realization is that weed was a way for me to exist in the modern world and exist among this disconnection, because really I want what the women have in Firefly Lane and it just seems like most people aren‚Äôt really THERE even when they are with you.

Weed made me feel less judgmental of my creative work. It eased period cramps, helped me sleep through the night, and generally felt like a sigh of relief. Until it didn't.

Weed became as routine as my morning tea. My teeth took an ugly tinge, and I was downright irritable without being high. Instead of augmenting my creative abilities, weed made me feel ok with doing nothing. Once I realized it was hindering me more than helping me, I let it go.  

It's ok to thank it and move on. I'm now looking for a job, and while I miss weed sometimes, nothing feels as good as not having to worry about passing a drug test, missing opportunities, looking high around friends and family, or kneecapping my creative abilities. The high I got from weed is not as satisfying or soothing as the absence of anxiety I have now. 

I relapsed once. And the whole time, I thought...is this worth it? If I got a a job offer tomorrow and was instructed to take a test within 24-48 hours, is it worth it to feel high for two hours?  

This is more of a reminder to myself more than anything, but if you're a struggling with quitting due to how it helps with anxiety, remember: the certainty you get from knowing you don't have anything to hide is better for your anxiety than being high.",20,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43431047}"

Lockdown hasn‚Äôt been easy on that front. I smoked all the time. (I‚Äôm an artist) so I figured it‚Äôd help me but it was like a writers block when I‚Äôm high.

So I know what substance dependency looks like, in him. He still wakes up and drinks vodka. (We‚Äôre Russian) I feel like at this point if he stops he dies.

I'm wondering how long others experienced the nightmares and very intense dreams. I'm having a hard time sleeping. 

I also get scared and feel doubtful when I think about doing things I used to enjoy high. I am a landscaper and gardener and like hiking and camping and it's kind of hard to imagine doing those things without pot. I felt like pot would energize me or at least take me out of my head when I was tired or bored.

I have been smoking regularly since I was 20, am now 28. The only times I had stopped was when I was depressed and didn't want to face the thoughts being high brought up. I had stopped for 6 months previously but I was depressed and not facing myself so I don't know how much that counted.

I am feeling better now, less anxiety, no longer feeling the initial wave of depression. I have read that withdrawals peak at day 10, has anyone else experienced this?

Any advice or helpful experiences are greatly appreciated. Reading this sub has been a great help to me. I'm not sure I'll stop smoking forever but I definitely need a good break and to reevaluate my relationship with pot.

All my extra time and money was going into weed. The state of the world made me depressed and anxious, and I was smoking more heavily than I ever had. Something had to change, and the thing I could control was myself, so I took the leap and told myself I had enough. 

For two months, I was able to resist and I actually enjoyed being sober. I went through some withdrawals but it was worth it. My dreams were more vivid, I wasn't coughing constantly and clearing my throat every minute.   Stopping the cough and the nasty phlegm/congestion was worth it on its own.

I still lived with someone who smoked, and I had the connection so I would buy for them. I made several pickups without the urge to smoke. Unfortunately, one terrible day was all it took for me to fall back into my addiction. 

Since then I've been back on the smoke daily train, but it was more ""manageable""--fewer times per day and making sure what I bought lasted me until my next pickup. I moved into a new place and my dealer (also an old friend from before I smoked) would come drop off my goods, making it only that much easier for me to justify smoking again.

Well, last week, he went out of state and has seemingly no intention of coming back. I have no other connects. I just finished the last of what I had yesterday, and retired my paraphernalia.

The first night is always the worst. I didn't sleep until 6AM and only managed a short nap before my son woke me up. And when I did, I felt my heart racing again like last time. Sweat forming, anxiety creeping in. Just terrible.

I have used weed as a coping mechanism since I was around 17, on and off, but mostly on (now 31). I am a high functioning person, I only smoked 1 J in the evenings to help me relax and numb my mind.

Last night was not 'that' hard, I made a decision in my mind to just stop, I didn't tell anyone I was going to for the fear of not following through and it just being empty words again. Not even my partner who I live with!

Hi guys,
I just got off another relapse. The last time I smoked was this past Wednesday, Feb 17, 2021 (but we'll get back to that)...


It all started when I was 18, right after I graduated high school (summer 2014). A friend at the time (we'll call him Fred) offered to smoke me out for my first time, since I'd soon be off to university.
I was enamored by this magical plant; it was everything that Fred, the media and everyone else told me it would be. At first, I didn't know what to expect - thought it wasn't hitting - so I smoked some more! One hit after the next, and before I knew it, it hit me. Time slowed down; music felt amazing; everything was so funny, so novel. The food! The munchies! This was great! It was so great, in fact, that I had to try it a couple more times before I left for college. My cravings had begun...

(Context) Now, around this time, my estranged father had died, so I had some life insurance money.

When I first got to uni, I was an awkward fuck. At a campus event, I bumped into a former classmate and we clicked (let's call him Bob). Bob invited me to a party with him and his roommates, I got super cross faded, and I embarrassed the fuck out of myself (I asked a chick if she had ""experience"" and made a humping motion ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Bob, the socialite that he is, figured he could take me under his wing and show me his ways so I could be less awk. Long story short, Bob and I developed a weird psychologically abusive codependency, where I used him as a way to get away from my roommates (who were against weed, drugs, etc.), so I could smoke freely, and where Bob used my na√Øve ass for my life insurance money. I'd basically been crashing at his dorm more than at my own. By the end of the semester, he and I had a falling out, but of course, we were still on and off friends for a while after that.

Winter break came, and I somehow passed my classes. Back home, I had such an urge to smoke. Now, I was smoking multiple times a day. I can remember clearly, smoking weed from a crack pipe in my backyard, all paranoid, and for a moment, I felt like a crackhead, but for weed (pothead? lol). This was when I started to notice that I was beginning to feel depressed...

By the first week back at school in the spring, I was smoking all day everyday. However, before I knew it, things would start catching up to me. Right about at this time, Bob, some friends and I got caught smoking by the cops. My high, dumb ass, of course, tried to run and put the blame on my friends. I ended up being the only one charged (probably due to my poor behavior). Thankfully, we didn't go to jail, and I ended up doing a pretrial diversion. After this happened, I spiraled TF into a pit of depression; everything was hitting me. This was the first few weeks I had stopped smoking since I became a stoner. I stopped attending classes, and couldn't even get myself out of bed; I had to medically withdraw from my classes. Eventually, I ended up deciding to move back home and go to a local community college.

Summer (2015) came, and by this point my insurance money had mostly run out. I felt so lost; in my mind, I had fucked up my chance to live the university life, go to parties, get laid, and of course, the easy access to drugs on a college campus. Back at home, I ended up working for a friend so I could have some cash flow, and of course, keep up with my habit.
Between this time and around the same time the next year, I had to do my pretrial diversion. For the random drug tests (which I never even had to take), I would always try to time my consumption, flush my system, blah blah blah. [This was probably my most functional time as a stoner (if you can even call that functional)] In reality, I was trying to have my cake and eat it too..

Starting back at school in the fall after all that'd happened was stressful, and I had little coping mechanisms aside from pot, so I would always be breaking out. Regardless, because I wasn't smoking as much as I normally would, I ended up doing okay that semester.

Spring (2016) came, and for the first time in my life, I had an adult relationship with someone (we'll call her Mary) (albeit in hindsight, I really only stayed with her for the consistent sex). Our relationship lasted from February to July. Things were great at first, but around June, my mom had found out that I went out with my friend Fred to smoke, and took away my privileges for my car for a month. I fell into a pit of depression before I knew it; I couldn't smoke, I couldn't go out to see my friends, and I couldn't go fuck my GF! WTF, mom! üôÑ
Partly because of this, my relationship with Mary went stale. It didn't help that we'd already been planning to go out of state for July 4th where I'd meet her family. During this trip, I was so depressed, and just kind of kept to myself. At Mary's friend's house, I smoked and was acting all creepy towards Mary, so her friends separated us for the night. On the fourth, her and I were discussing how things weren't working out, so we mutually decided to break up. After that, things were even more awkward with her family, cuz now I'm just this weirdo staying in their house who's never gonna see them again.
Aaaannyyways, this led me into the worst depressive episode of my life. At one point, my high ass left a close friend several miles from home with no ride because I goofed things up due to a misunderstanding. This made me feel like such a fucking POS. How could I do this to someone, let alone such a close friend of mine. I became suicidal. I never acted on it, but the feeling was so incredibly overwhelming. The only thing keeping me going was that tiny little thought in the back of my mind that things could somehow get better (and I wanted to see how the election turned out lol).
It was during this depression that I started to realize I may be addicted to pot, and started to cut back. At one point, Fred was pressuring me to smoke with him, and I told him that I wasn't tryna smoke at the time. We ended up in an argument, some things were said, and I had cut him off for good.

The end of the year came, and my depression started to lift. I'd decided to look into a career in nursing, so I signed up for 5 prereq classes in the spring to see if I was really interested. In December, I met this girl (let's call her Jane). Everything about her seemed perfect; she was in the nursing program at my school, we had similar interests, we got along so well, and I thought she was gorgeous. I was head over heels for Jane.
(2017) We dated for about a month before I asked her out as my GF. Less than a week later, she comes to me with a message from God that we can't be together anymore, as I was an atheist at the time (turned out she was an evangelical and secretly wanted to convert me üôÑ).
When this happened, I was PISSED. Not at her (as I didn't see it as her fault), not at myself (nor did I see it my fault), and not at God (how could I be mad at someone I didn't believe in). At several points, when I was at my job, I had to step out to go to my car so I could be alone, where I would scream at the top of my lungs til my voice gave out. It was the only way I could let out my frustration. It was at this point that I began a pot bender, and started falling behind in my classes.
I met with Jane a few times after our breakup to hookup, and during our last sesh, she noticed that I was high (I'd been high around her once when we were dating, and she told me that she had wanted me to be mentally present when I was with her). This time, she'd had enough, and told me that it couldn't work out no matter how much either one of us wanted it to.........

If I was PISSED before, I was BEYOND PISSED now, and now I knew exactly who to be pissed at. My screaming, my rage, everything, I let it all out. For the first time in my life as a pothead, I saw my addiction truly for what it was, and I knew that I had to quit. I quit cold turkey. All of the stress, all the weed, everything that'd happened was culminating to this. I ended up going into a manic episode, where I used my manic energy to start turning things around. I was able to get straight As, take another 5 classes in the summer, get my A.A., and eventually my A.S.
Here I am now as a registered nurse, with my own car, got an adult job, and recently, I moved out of my mom's into my own apartment.

Since I quit, I've had several slip ups, and several relapses. Everytime I've relapsed, I keep doing the same stupid shit. One time, I'd forgot where I left my car (twice), acted creepy towards my longtime friend's sister and estranged their whole family.
If I take even one hit, I'll smoke, immediately get the urge to smoke more, and get high as fuck, often to the point of greening out. I often waste a shitton of money on food and other unnecessary shit.

This last relapse, I pulled all the stops. It started at the beginning of this month when I got weed for my friend with my med card, and while I was waiting for him to come over, I decided that I wanted to try smoking in my apartment since I could do that now. Big mistake. Once I started, I couldn't stop. I knew every moment what was going on, and didn't want to accept it. At the beginning, I tried so hard to understand what my mindset was when high that leads me to just want to smoke more and more and more after that first hit. Looking back now, it's always been like that, all the way back to that first hit I took with Fred in 2014.
Eventually, my high self decided to do some self sabotage [like, all the same shit I normally do high but to an extreme (e.g. buy a ton of food and instead of eating the leftovers just getting more, buying a bunch of shit I don't need on Amazon, and letting my apartment pile up with garbage) (mind you, I was half aware half the time)]. In my mind, this was some sort of way to convince my sober self to accept that no matter what I do, I have no control over my addiction to THC.


I want to stop.. I want to never take another hit between now, and the day I leave this earth.......

I‚Äôm now 21 and graduating college soon, it‚Äôs a now or never moment coming up for me and I just can‚Äôt seem to stop smoking. The first thing I think about when I wake up is smoking. If I don‚Äôt, the stomach pain just takes me over. My appetite has turned to basically nothing and eating before smoking is nearly impossible. 



I‚Äôm seeking advice on where to begin this journey. The first steps to take, tips to get my appetite back, anything would help me at this point. Maybe someone can give me some help on how the heck to go to sleep without this drug!!!!!!!",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8442521}"

Beyond the fact that it's not right for me, i also fucked up by hiding it which has hurt my family pretty significantly.

I‚Äôve been wanting to quit for years but I realized my alcohol addiction had gotten so bad I needed to focus on that. That led me to tell myself that I could just stick to weed since it‚Äôs safer. So I hit up the guy for weed today and my plan for sobriety goes right out the window again.

I think the panic has to do with this routine and knowing that if I continue this path, my life won‚Äôt improve. It is eerily similar to the anxiety I had been feeling after my breakup over a year ago. Like I‚Äôm all alone with this addiction. With quarantine, I fell into the habit of multiple beers and weed throughout the day, every single day. This made it easier for me to isolate and not worry about the problems in my life.

Well now those same problems have gotten worse and they‚Äôre staring me in the face. I don‚Äôt know why, but I can‚Äôt seem to make friends anymore. I never really knew how to keep in touch with people and weed made that worse. So eventually people would start disappearing from my life till nobody was left.

I also have terrible anger issues, usually directed towards my parents. This has made my relationship with them tense, so I haven‚Äôt ever been able to open up with them. I‚Äôve never tried having a conversation with them because I hated them for so long, but now it sucks because I can‚Äôt even talk to them and I feel so alone. I almost feel like i deserve to be lonely because of how I treated my parents. 

I burned bridges with most old friends from home, so now I don‚Äôt even talk to anyone out there. I feel like nobody cares enough to try and reach out. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not important to them anymore and it hurts. I‚Äôve put so much time into smoking that I literally have no hobbies. My only hobbies are porn, weed, alcohol, sex and gambling, all of which don‚Äôt fulfill me. But I think Weed makes it harder to get out of the cycle.

So I sit here alone in my room again. I had felt complete despair earlier, like a sense of impending doom. I had to get up and go for a walk ASAP. It always comes when I realize I have no friends and I‚Äôm not even doing anything to fix it. It‚Äôs mostly because I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I feel like this addiction is normal that I can‚Äôt even remember enjoying life without it. 

I spend so much time working because I want money but I just spend most of it on weed or alcohol. So by only chasing money, it‚Äôs saddening because money doesn‚Äôt fulfill me. I need a hobby or something I enjoy but I‚Äôm still struggling to adopt one. I just need to convince myself money isn‚Äôt everything. 

It‚Äôs all such a vicious cycle and I‚Äôm a bit scared if I‚Äôm being honest. Even my ex said that I‚Äôd never quit weed and I laughed. But almost 2 years later and I‚Äôm still stuck in the same cycle. I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs right. I sometimes think I‚Äôll just stay high everyday till I die because that‚Äôs what I want. But then as I‚Äôm doing it, I realize that I‚Äôm just isolating myself more. The worst part is that I have anger issues, so I basically need weed when I‚Äôm back home. My mom has a way of making me mad quickly and it can get chaotic. 

That‚Äôs why my plan had been to quit weed while back at school, as I‚Äôd be away from that. But my mind just keeps playing games on myself. I feel like I need to just quit now because I‚Äôll just keep pushing it off again and again. I‚Äôm 24 years old and I‚Äôm still wasting time getting high like a high schooler. I should‚Äôve graduated by now but I was too busy partying and smoking to focus on my work. 

Weed isn‚Äôt completely to blame because I think the alcohol turned me into a worse person than I was when smoking. But I don‚Äôt want to create excuses for this drug anymore. I‚Äôve also realized that I drink when i smoke to help ease the anxiety. Now that I‚Äôm smoking without the alcohol, I‚Äôm feeling all those emotions I tried ignoring. I think weed is the root issue because it makes me depressed and that‚Äôs when I drink.",2,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9412955}"

The longest lasting symptom from this whole quit has been anxiety, which I assume is just an underlining issue I have. 

I‚Äôve gotten all sorts of test done to make sure everything is okay and majority of it came back looking good so I can only assume what I feel is from anxiety even though I don‚Äôt feel anxious about anything. I wear a Fitbit to track heart rate to help with the anxiety. 

Hoping as I get closer to 9 months - a year that I‚Äôll be 100% back to myself and anxiety lessen more. I should probably start to exercise too as I‚Äôve been sedentary for far too long especially with quarantine, I‚Äôm sure that would help with what I‚Äôm feeling.

It's been a total of 45 days. One of my longest streaks thus far in an overall rollercoaster of a 5 or so year addiction. Actually, the only synonymous experience my life has had this past half decade with a rollercoaster is the fact that both can break down and become stagnant for a while. This was exactly how my life became, even before I was able to reach the biggest drop of the ride. I stopped growing, achieving, understanding who I was and what I was here for; everything that made life worthwhile crumbled through my hands. My life became pointless, as I wasn't living.

Since I've quit, my life has become astronomically better, but I'm not at the point I'd like to be, and I know I won't get there for a bit. Hell, abusing anything for half a decade will take its toll on your psyche. Here are some positives, negatives, and things that have both helped and hindered my development. To put it in perspective as well, I'm 26 (started at 20/21) and at my worse I was smoking a gram or two a day plus endless hits of the pen.

*Positives*

Better relationships with friends/family/dog

Memory has improved dramatically (all three of working, short, and long term)

Increased ease in recalling words

**Expanded awareness**

More motivation and energy (though still working on it)

Deeper understanding of true empathy

*Negatives*

Looming low self-esteem (though getting better every day)

Shame, regret and guilt emerging

Self-critical 

Anhedonia (but this is almost gone as of now)

&#x200B;

*Things that have helped*

**Reading!** (I can't recommend this enough. I purchased a kindle fire for $75 and have read at least an hour a day ever since I've quit. I've enriched my vocabulary, stimulated my mind, and become much better at communicating my thoughts)

Gym and eating healthy

Dog

Connecting with people (even though I still feel shame that I cannot communicate with people in the way that I'd like)

*Things that have not helped*

Trading addictions (main negative vices have been alcohol and masturbating)

Delving into negative media

Self-criticization

**Isolating myself** (This has always been my go to in life. A huge component as to why I spiraled into daily use/always being high was the constant bombardment of inexplicable anguish and negative self talk that consistently looped the thought that I was and will never be good enough. I always isolated in order to ""better myself"", whatever that meant at the time, in order to feel like I belonged. And newsflash, you will never feel that sense of security searching outward, it will only be grasped going inward. I've realized that a lot, and I mean A LOT, of people have felt this way too. Which has helped to an incredible extent, but it's still a learning process nonetheless)

I‚Äôm on day 1 after a week binge (after 4 days off). 


I‚Äôm here to vent about the general feeling of ‚Äúlack‚Äù. 

Do you know what I‚Äôm talking about? That feeling in your stomach that something is wrong, that something needs to be figured out. 

The kind of feeling that makes you question all your friends and people close to you..surely I‚Äôm feeling this way because I have no friends. But then you remind yourself that no‚Äîyou definitely have friends, close friends. What you don‚Äôt have right now is a distraction on a Monday at 7PM. You‚Äôve had your work day, you‚Äôve worked out, you‚Äôve talked to your mom - even exchanged a few texts here and there with friends. 

Even have plans for a dinner on Friday with a friend you haven‚Äôt seen in a long time. But that feeling of lack persists and is sitting with you the whole time, in the back of your head.

That feeling of lack ‚Äî I‚Äôm used to quelling it, most recently with weed but when I was younger I don‚Äôt think I ever did. I just kept moving on to the next thing, the next goal because surely once we attain that, then the feeling of lack is going to go away right? 

Then you attain those things...and the feeling doesn‚Äôt go away. It‚Äôs still there. Systematically, I‚Äôd look at each piece of my life, trying to fill this hole. Trying to fill the feeling of lack. 

But now I‚Äôm 28 - I‚Äôve had a lot of cycles of this feeling in my life, only the last 6 or so have involved weed. 

It‚Äôs a lot different now too - my friends are generally getting married or almost there - spread out across the country and thinking about starting their families. I‚Äôm more confident today in my friendships than I was 10 years ago, but the thought patterns persist, and they‚Äôre ridiculous. I literally was asked to give  a speech at this dudes wedding a year ago - and have known him for over a decade, but the same thought patterns still pop up. 


I think I‚Äôm writing this for two reasons:
1) if anyone else recognizes this cycle or some of these thought patterns - wherever you are on your journey, I want to share with you that I think that feeling will never go away until you‚Äôre able to deal with it for yourself. For me, I can look at times in my life where I had a lot of whatever in this moment I think I lack, and I never once felt present or joy. It‚Äôs a me problem. When I think about how many moments I was never present for because of these thought patterns, it really upsets me. And I realize this was something I always did. The weed was just like a god mode version of lack of presence. 

2) this shit really sucks. It‚Äôs fucking hard to do. Time moves slowly, I constantly feel like I need something - and you just gotta have the blind faith that the work you‚Äôre putting in is real and worth it.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47920063}"

All of the little tasks and decisions throughout your day require alertness, but weed allows you to simply go through the motions. These daily tasks seem trivial when you are high, and the mind is at ease without having to fully contemplate every decision.

Over the long term, these decisions add up. They amass into who you are. If every decision revolves around returning to comfort and getting high, you WILL avoid challenging decisions and tasks. The harder routes provide learning and progression towards long term rewards, but these routes WILL be avoided for the most comfortable short term route of escaping with smoking.

In other words, weed autopilot smooths your path into the easiest route possible. You avoid challenges, you avoid conflict, but in doing so you avoid development over the long term. We as humans are not meant to coast through life. We are here in this subreddit because we recognize we cannot moderate our consumption. If we are consistently high over a long period of time, we lose our sense of self to the ease of autopilot:

Autopilot will choose to remain in the familiarity of a toxic relationship rather than face the conflict and discomfort of leaving.

Autopilot will choose to endure your job week after week rather than striving towards the next step in your career.

Autopilot will choose not to learn a new hobby rather than face embarrassment and failure during the learning process.

Overall, weed autopilot will choose boredom over activity, familiarity over new opportunities, and ease over discomfort. We must embrace discomfort, embrace opportunity, and turn off the autopilot so that we can once again embrace life.",2390,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47175866}"

I can't remember where I heard the analogy, but Marijuana was discribed to me as ""A Jealous Lover"" (or maybe I made it up?). Once she gets you into her relationship she doesn't want to share. She cuts you off slowly from friends, family, hobbies, goals, even love. But you love her right? She makes you feel almost good enough, but only if you stay. If you try to leave, she is always there calling you. Begging you to come back and be with her. She says you ""need"" me. 

I'm not leaving because I don't love her, but we have a toxic relationship and we need to separate. I have to delete her from my phone, move out her things. Not because I want to cheat on her, but because I want my self back. 

It's Day 3. Sweaty palms, boredom, depression, loss of appetite, extremely vivid dreams, low energy, boredom and very, very tempted to invite her back. 

She has kept me ""high"" almost every day for the last 15 years. I've never gone more than a few weeks without during that time and never because I really wanted to quit her and she never wanted to let me go. 

I used to be such a happy person, I was a light to others. I was ambitious and courageous. If that person is still there, it's time for me to find him again because he (me) is my true love.

I‚Äôve been smoking for about two years now. I‚Äôve gone through periods of pipe smoking a couple nights a week, periods of having multiple gravity bing sessions a day, and everything in between. Point is, I‚Äôve been in varying degrees of addiction these past two years and the longest break I‚Äôve ever get taken was one month.

I stopped smoking two weeks ago after doing some reflection on my life and the first weeks withdrawals were easily dealt with. Had a couple of late, sweaty nights but no big deal. Mentally I was feeling clearer and happier. However, a few days ago I began feeling crippling anxiety (foggy mind, hard to think, social anxiety) and I‚Äôm unsure of whether this is weed withdrawals or something else.

My question to you: is it possible that some of the psychological withdrawals get worse with time, kind of like a delayed fuse? I know that after week two things should be getting better, but it‚Äôs been the opposite for me. Have any of you had that happen?

Today is my day 1!! - I've been a daily smoker for nearly 26 years, I'm 40 now, single mother of 2 girls.  It has taken me so long to realise that  weed is no good for me.  I was always in denial  - that is not addictive, that I can stop whenever I want, that was all a lie.   I have tried a few times and failed but I am determined this time.  I have a plan this time, I'm not just winging it.   I have thrown all my 'utensils' out  and have a new routine set in place for when I needed it most, bed time.  I'm using 2 apps to track my non use, I cant wait to see 24hrs of no use!  I know it doesn't sound like much to some but this is so huge for me.  
I'm so nervous though, I've smoked my entire adult life but I am so tired of living a half life.  I have let so many wonderful opportunities go by because of my addiction.  No more!  I want to be present for my kids at all times, I want to live my life alive and clear and not in a haze watching endless tv shows I will no doubt forget.   It is just i don't know a life without it.    
I am quite fortunate in the way that most of my mates aren't smokers, so there wont be any worry there. But they also don't understand my huge struggle - some say its just in my head and weed isn't addictive - I usually then, go into a long rant about what addiction means and yes it is.

Good Afternoon (my time) [r/leaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/),

Today is Day 104. I‚Äôd like to review what‚Äôs helped me before I quit, what's helped me during my initial sobriety, and what‚Äôs been helping me move forward.

**My Experience**

**1. Taking ownership of my problem and the solution.**

‚¶Å I was regularly browsing this sub, and I believed (at least in part ‚Äì and correctly) that weed was causing more harm than good in my life.

‚¶Å It took about‚Ä¶10 years for me to admit that yes, I had a problem and no, I couldn't ever smoke moderately and expect to live up to my full potential. Through several quit streaks and attempts this has proven 100% true.

‚¶Å Almost every addiction memoir, from alcohol to weed to other drugs usually has a part where the author tried to moderate. Sometimes it works, maybe even for a few weeks, months, or even a year or so. Eventually, they fall back into the addiction trap.

‚¶Å I had to own the following problems: Weed was not a positive force in any way, shape or form in my life. Additionally, if I wanted to live a life that's filled with growth, maturity, wisdom, and achievement, addiction was holding me back.

‚¶Å Accepting that there is no one else to blame. Acknowledge my mistakes, admit my failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to overcome this challenge.

**2. It hasn‚Äôt been easy.**

*‚ÄúNothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty‚Ä¶ I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.‚Äù* ‚Äì Theodore Roosevelt

‚¶Å The main reasoning I used to obliterate myself with any substance was to reward myself after a hard day. Difficult day at work? Have a bowl (or 5). Kids are being annoying today? Smoke it all away. Had a fight with my wife? Looks like I‚Äôll be smoking it up. All this served to do was avoid challenges in my life. I avoided the problem, and it went away (or so I thought). What really happened was I simply put it off until it would grow to an unmanageable size and explode. Being high all the time meant that I was too compromised to deal with the actual problem ‚Äì to take ownership of the problem and the solution so I could overcome the challenge or work through it.

‚¶Å It‚Äôs okay to relax and it‚Äôs just fine to want to unwind. Understanding for myself what was the best way for me to do that was the key. Smoking weed didn‚Äôt help me relax; in fact, it only helped torpedo my relationships and my time into a black hole where nothing was going to escape. Addiction will make you think that the substance is the ONLY thing that will EVER help you relax or unwind. This is a lie.

*‚ÄúThe Buddha famously said that life is suffering. I‚Äôm not a Buddhist, but I know what he meant and so do you. To exist in this world, we must contend with humiliation, broken dreams, sadness, and loss. That‚Äôs just nature. Each specific life comes with its own personalized portion of pain. It‚Äôs coming for you. You can‚Äôt stop it. And you know it.*

*In response, most of us are programmed to seek comfort as a way to numb it all out and cushion the blows. We carve out safe spaces. We consume media that confirms our beliefs, we take up hobbies aligned with our talents, we try to spend as little time as possible doing the tasks we loathe, and that makes us soft. We live a life defined by the limits we imagine and desire for ourselves because it‚Äôs comfortable in that box.‚Äù*

‚Äì David Goggins

‚¶Å I had to understand that life doesn‚Äôt stop, care, or give a shit about me, my sleep problems, my addiction, or my stomach issues after quitting. It will keep coming. To avoid a relapse, I had to understand what my plan was when things get tough. Was I going to blame? Or take ownership? Was I going to go back to my comfortable box, or would I get ready to hurt and suffer to transform myself from the addicted individual to the hardest individual on the planet?

‚¶Å At 91 days in, my Mom was rushed to the hospital with a fatal condition. By day 93, she was gone. I‚Äôm still dealing with this and I can say unequivocally that I am so happy, grateful, thankful, and relieved that I WAS NOT HIGH. I was present and ready for what I needed to do to support myself, my family, my Mom and I have my sobriety to thank for it.

‚¶Å *‚ÄúWe know what it means to fail‚Äîto lose, to be surprised, outmaneuvered, or simply beaten. Those lessons were the hardest, but perhaps the most important. We learned that leadership requires belief in the mission and unyielding perseverance to achieve victory, particularly when doubters question whether victory is even possible.‚Äù* ‚Äì Jocko Willink

**3. Developed my personalized plan to win ‚Äì what was I going to do when things got difficult? How am I going to grow and improve?**

‚¶Å For me, I had to take ownership of the fact that I wasn‚Äôt ever going to be able to smoke weed and be an effective partner to my wife, father to my children, or leader in my career field. No ‚Äòone joint in a year‚Äô or ‚Äòone hit around a campfire‚Äô or ‚Äòone blunt at a concert‚Äô for me. As soon as I did that every other time I‚Äôve quit, it was right back to smoking to oblivion a few weeks, a month, or sometimes a year later. One way or another ‚Äì I had to accept I cannot smoke weed and live a meaningful life.

‚¶Å Once I had that internalized, I had to remove the concept from my mind that challenges are things to shirk away from, to avoid, and to ‚Äòrelax‚Äô from. This only held me back ‚Äì professionally and personally. Avoiding problems almost led to the disintegration of my marriage and my family. Challenges left unanswered were going to leave me in a box with my career and my life ‚Äì never growing, never learning, and never moving forward.

**My plan is multi-faceted and is still in progress:**

‚¶Å I no longer use substances to deal with problems. I face challenges eagerly, head-on, and without question. I do not let failure cut me down or hold me back. I use it to learn, grow, and move forward.

‚¶Å Personal mantras to help me in difficult times: Prioritize and Execute. Move fast, seize initiative. Move with speed, but not haste. Value initiative and proactive attitudes above all else. Don‚Äôt let my personal passion for excellence outweigh my compassion for others. Be humble or be humbled. Improvise, adapt, and overcome. Lead the way for others and help the team. The whole of a team is far greater and more valuable than my own efforts. Be careful and deliberate in planning but don‚Äôt over plan. Be humble but not passive.

*‚ÄúBe brilliant in the basics. Don‚Äôt dabble in my \[life, job, sobriety\]; you must master it. That applies at every level as you advance. Analyze myself. Identify weaknesses and improve myself‚Ä¶\[People\] are counting on you. Of course, you‚Äôll screw up sometimes; don‚Äôt dwell on that‚Ä¶just be honest and move on, smarter for what my mistake taught you.‚Äù* ‚Äì Jim Mattis

‚¶Å Take care of myself and discipline myself: Up at 5:30 AM, every day. Sleep in until 6:15 AM if I was up late the previous night. Exercise with light calisthenics, eventually moving up to body weight training ‚Äì to get endorphins flowing and serotonin going. Set out my gear for the next day the night before. Pay attention to my body and its responses to different emotions. Get in therapy for things from my childhood that have caused me to be angry and impulsive. Eat regular meals, at regular intervals. Cut out the sugar, caffeine (this was the hardest) to understand how I feel and how my body feels when I‚Äôm at a baseline.

‚¶Å Always look for ways to improve. Read books, listen to podcasts, and never stop trying to define ways to get better in life.

**4. Understanding I must pay it forward. Never stop learning. Commit 100% to sobriety, to improvement, and to building a winning Team of friends, family, and contacts to surround myself with.**

‚¶Å I need to support the community I surround myself with. Making sure to reach out to others, thank those who help me, recognize success, cut out toxic individuals from my life. Develop friends and build relationships. Building relationships and building trust are at the core of community.

‚¶Å The Rat Park experiment is extremely revealing. Isolation and addiction go hand in hand:

‚¶Å Who do I care about in my life? Who cares about me? When was the last time I spent time with people who are good for me - instead of those who hurt me and foster my addiction?

‚¶Å The pandemic has proved to be difficult. Instead of blaming it for being unable to engage in community ‚Äì I have been using the resources available to me in order to achieve the same outcome. This community ([r/leaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/)), Discord, gaming communities and more are all solid options.

‚¶Å I don‚Äôt resent people who can use weed responsibly. I understand that my brain is wired differently, and I am unable to enjoy that. Similarly, I don‚Äôt resent Tom Brady for being able to throw a football like he does when I can‚Äôt (although I do resent him because I‚Äôm a Seahawks fan, but we won‚Äôt get into that).

**5. Qualities to aspire to: What is talent and who has potential? From the book ""The Talent War"":**

*Based on our research and interviews, we have identified nine core characteristics that mark an individual as having high potential:*

***Drive***‚Äîthe unrelenting need for achievement and constant self-improvement

***Resiliency***‚Äîthe ability to persevere in the face of challenge and bounce back from setbacks.

***Adaptability***‚Äîthe ability to adjust according to the situation, learn new things, innovate, and try new methods.

***Humility***‚Äîself-confidence in one‚Äôs ability while understanding that there‚Äôs always room for improvement and that others‚Äô experiences and knowledge are valuable.

For the first couple of years it was a medicine for my depression. Living at home and smoking behind my parents back. For the first couple of years it was just to survive the day and not off myself. To sleep. To forget. Then I got caught. I got sober. But just for month. I had horrible night sweats, couldn sleep for more than an hour. So I started smoking again, but less and less, maybe just a toke before sleep.

Then i got my first real job. I kept clean for 2 months to pass the doctor's exam. It was sooooo much easier. I thought I am ok, i thought I have it under control. So I started smoking again. But only when I went out, so I was smoking once or twice a week for years. I knew I was not really myself the whole day after smoking, but I rationalized is a hangover. No problem, it was ok. I handled grad school, I handled my job, everything was getting better.

And than 2020 came. I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years, bought an apartment and was living on my own for the first time. But as soon as I moved lockdown hit. Job was easy, I did my work in 3-4 hours and than I was free. I was going on walks, hiking and I have reconnected with a friend I wasn't hanging out for years. But she smoked a lot and had connection to assloads of free weed. So after a walk we shared a joint almost everyday. But then the autumn came and shitty weather made walks an annoying chore. So we just smoked. She gave me a mason jar full of homegrown. So I started smoking everyday from the minute I finished my work till I stumbled in my bed. With so much weed I decided to make cookies, and started eating them daily, sometimes during the last zoom call of the day, so I was nice and stoned the minute I was clocked out. I met a new girl, she is really amazing and never smoked weed. When she found my cookie stash (around 100 cookies), she wanted to try them. So that became part of our weekend routine. 

In January i bought a vape, so I started ""microdosing"" everyday all day. My job performance started to tank, but I handled it. I didn't even got stoned anymore just numb. I hated it. 

And I decided to give it a rest. And failed. Several times. Becuse I never dared to tell anyone I cannot quit. But now lent started and although I am not religious I decided to join one of my smoker friend to quit weed, alcohol for 40 days. To reset ourself. One week ago I cleaned my paraphernalia and store them in the basement. That was last monday. 

I have so much energy now, although it is not easy. But it is getting better everyday. I decided to not be too hard for the first couple of weeks, so I replaced my stoned time with Cyberpunk time which working fine. 

I was terrified that nightsweats will be the bane of my existence for weeks, but I got lucky and I am sleeping better everynight. Yesterday I even slept all night, which was a nice surprise. Now my battle is with my anxiety. I hope it will soon die down.

I know I don't want quit for ever, because a bowl on a Friday night is something I enjoy dearly. But until the covid restrictions end there is no way I can allow myself to imbibe, because if I don't have a full schedule, I will fill my entire existence with stoned numbness.",2,"{'lockdown': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5630761}"

I'm on a new anti-depressant and also have medication, if the depression gets too severe. I feel like the anti-depressant slowly starts to have an effect.

Additionally, I plan a stay at a psychosomatic hospital.
On 10th of march I have an appointment, where I introduce myself at the hospital.
I really want to get my shit together and fight my avoidant personality disorder, the aftermath of the psychosis and gain back self-esteem.

I feel so good and happy not smoking weed anymore. I can't believe how much happier I feel all around.  I honestly thought weed made happy and helped with my depression but it was making it worse every time I lit a joint. 

I quit last year for 13 months then relapsed for 2 months, was sober for a week then relapsed again and now iam 6 days sober again. I always tell myself that not smoking truly makes me a happier and a better person.  
I was a daily smoker for 12 years and I have never been happy as I am today. 
I'm taking it one day at a time. I never thought I'd become an addict to weed but admitting this today makes it easier for tomorrow. 
If you are unhappy with life and yourself, make a change to say goodbye to weed and don't look back. You maybe surprised what will happen....

I quit for a couple of years around the age of 22 with the help of this sub. The problem is that I replaced it with alcohol, so in some ways it doesn‚Äôt really count to me.

I thought I could handle responsible use so I tried it again a couple years ago, and now here I am struggling to quit once more. I‚Äôm here to ask for advice, but if I can offer you all any advice myself: don‚Äôt start again if it was a huge struggle to stop in the first place.

Since I quit before, I should know the answers to my questions, but I stopped again for a couple of months over the summer and I didn‚Äôt get the same results. I just felt like I might as well have been still toking at that time.

My struggles when I quit mainly are an enormous lack of motivation/focus, and chronic depression. I struggle with these even while smoking, but they get so much worse when I stop. I just dissociate like crazy through my phone, TV, or video games. Literally I could spend all day staring at my phone. I have had the same goals for YEARS that I never really work towards because of this. I also have no support because I have no friends or family nearby who understand. The loneliness makes this so hard.

I‚Äôm hoping someone reading this can relate. Does this struggle get better? What are some strategies you‚Äôve used to make this transition more bearable for you? I see the same things suggested all of the time, but I already do them - I‚Äôm in weekly therapy for PTSD, I do daily yoga. I‚Äôve been meditating for years, I run or hike almost every day, I even live in one of my favourite places in the world.

I watched quitting goals come and go as the decades went by. ""I'll quit when I'm 25"", ""I'll quit when I'm 30"" and many more promises to myself that never materialized. Finally I had enough and on June 14th I used weed for the last time. The first 6 months, as I expected and had prepared for, were a challenge.

The whole 6 months weren't horrible but there were definitely challenging moments. What worked for me was a shift in attitude about myself, my life, the purpose that weed served (and didn't) and my disassoctiation with that life style. I stopped identifying as a stoner and pulled myself out of that culture. More importantly I came to the realization that I could cope with life naturally with what the universe provided me with. I just needed to heal.

Healing does happen, its a slow gradual process but things are *so much* different now. Life is life and shitty things still happen but facing them head on is rewarding. The natural highs from achieving your goals are more rewarding than getting stoned. Having a clear conscious and clear mind free from the burden of addiction is a welcome relief.

If you're in the beginning stages keep going, get through the struggles and challenges. Listen to the inner voice that tells you there is a better way, because its right. Make it the loud voice, pursue some of your goals, find some hobbies, start exercising. Push yourself to do things you wouldn't normally do.

As cheesy as it sounds, being sober is somewhat a ""high"" of its own because I find that being present and aware of what's happening at all times is exciting in and of itself. I'm hoping to maintain my sobriety even when this feeling wears off and things get boring.

I realized my marijuana use was a problem when I visited my family for the holidays but found that I couldn't enjoy the visit without getting stoned (and I have a functional, fun family that being sober around shouldn't be that difficult). I didn't quit then, but as I began to think about it more and more, I realized my constant weed use was affecting my sleep, contributing to my social anxiety, keeping me from creating goals and working toward them. I tried to justify my use, telling myself that because I hadn't lost friends, had kept up my grades, had maintained a fulltime job, etc., that that meant I was a ""high functioning stoner."" And honestly, maybe I was, but I still felt like it was limiting my potential and contributing to my problems more than it was contributing to the quality of my life.

The ultimate kicker for me was taking note of weed's impact on my memory. Exactly a week ago, my boyfriend and I watched his favorite movie (and of course I was totally high) and the next day I couldn't recall any of the references he was making toward the movie. I'm not about that kind of life.

I was (and still am) a spiritual person and didn‚Äôt even drink alcohol at this point yet alone do drugs. However, I had a few best friends/roommates  (I was in college) whom I loved and trusted and they offered me some weed to ease the pain. For the first year I ONLY used a dab pen and it was more or less only for pain, but I definitely started to enjoy it and had no shame about that. I started smoking flower/bud whatever you wanna call it somewhere around October of 2019, and then come March 2020 I was in Malibu for Spring break enjoying many keef covered joints, smoking bowls, etc. Then at the end of that trip, Covid hit hard and school was cancelled and my job (I was a server and bartender) got closed for a while. 

So, I was sitting at home getting paid $850 a week in unemployment, so naturally I just smoked a shit ton. I started getting into collecting glass and spent hundreds and hundreds adding to my collection, and from March of 2020 up until January of 2021 I was smoking 1/8th a day. It got to the point where I was using it as a crutch for depression and anxiety (something I had never struggled with before so I wasn‚Äôt aware of this) but I just thought with the way the world was and some other things that were going on in my life that this was all pretty fair. It took me a long time to realize that I was smoking weed 24/7 (and doing other drugs) in an attempt to escape reality/sobriety bc I wasn‚Äôt happy with it. I was depressed. Even after realizing it, the weed was still a crutch and the only thing that helped. However, i made some mistakes, hurt some people, etc. and decided I needed to change some things in my life and get back to the confident, successful young man that I had always been. So, i forced myself to leave any and all weed/paraphernalia at home when i went on a 4 day vacation in order to physically not be able to smoke. It was hard as shit, and as soon as I got home i smoked lol. I did that again the next week on another trip for 4 days and then felt so defeated when I smoked on the 5th day. My roommate told me to have grace for myself bc 2 four day breaks in 2 weeks was HUGE. But i wasn‚Äôt satisfied. With that being said, I got rid of everything (fellow stoner‚Äôs are holding on to it all for me) and decided to take February off (yes i chose the shortest month lol). Yesterday marks 3 weeks free of weed, and among other changes, I am now so clear headed, happy, motivated, etc. etc. Smoking was a vicious cycle of putting me in a depressed place and then smoking to take away the pain. Now, I honestly don‚Äôt plan on being done forever, I‚Äôm actually looking forward to March 1st haha bc part of the reason I stopped was for a T-break as I couldn‚Äôt even get high any more lol, BUT i am so proud of where I am today.

Waiting for a perfect time to quit is stupid. Quitting for others is non-condusive. I shouldve spent my years after high school to pick up a trade rather than getting high.  Cars always been a passion but weed clouded my vision. Now I feel like I gotta leash on life.

I‚Äôm be been subbed for two years but only began my first real attempt to quit about 2 weeks ago. I went three days, smoked for 2, went for 6 days and smoked Friday, and UG omg this is awful. I knew about post acute withdrawal syndrome before I quit but actually living it is a different beast. 

I know this discomfort will pass but I haven‚Äôt been sleeping or eating and I have so much energy I don‚Äôt know what to do with it. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm humming at this insanely high frequency and I can‚Äôt find the off button. I‚Äôm exhausted and wired at the same time. I am SO TENSE it‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôm in my bed right now with my shoulders locked up and while I‚Äôm well versed in mindfulness and healthy coping strategies, this is so much harder than I thought it‚Äôd be. I feel clearer and my overall mental health is improving, but AUUUGH I want to SCREAM. I‚Äôm going to book a massage tomorrow, I‚Äôm getting desperate. 

It was nuts on Friday - I was foolish and smoked the normal amount I used to, which was a lot (like half a bowl), and while the first 2 hours were fun, I only slept 3 hours in a 36 hour period. My dreams are INSANE and may as well be real. Like I went swimming in one and leaned back in the water to dip my hair and whole scalp in and it felt real. I felt the cool water between my hairs  and the resistance of the water. 

Thanks for listening to me vent. Reading your posts helps me. I know this will pass. It‚Äôs hard to forgive myself for 3-4 straight years of being a daily smoker. I have this expectation that quitting should be effortless despite being educated about it. I feel so wrung out. While writing this I‚Äôve deliberately relaxed and taken deep breaths multiple times but my shoulders begin tending up on their own and suddenly I‚Äôll come back to attention after zoning up and I‚Äôm even tighter than before. I do t want to smoke, mostly bc it feels fucking awful now and makes me manic, but I suddenly see why my therapist was so worried about me having something to replace weed as a coping mechanism. I guess what I‚Äôm feeling now is all the tension I‚Äôve been holding back and numbing this whole time and my only recourse is to feel it.

I lived to smoke and my whole life revolved around me getting high, when I was getting high next, and me wishing I were high. No one ever thought of it as a problem because I was still super productive (graduated college in 3 years, held adult jobs (ended up quitting both because of my mental health), and was pretty involved with the community. My friends called me a high functioning drug addict and well, that‚Äôs what I was and no one rly batted an eye. Like fr, they would see me rip my bong and then go out and drive them and I‚Äôd be hitting my bong while driving, that was so casual then. Fucking stupid now. It‚Äôs funny because if I were drinking instead of smoking, or doing coke or xans or pretty much any other drug out there, this would be a whole different story but because it‚Äôs weed, no one takes weed addiction seriously. 

I look back now and I WISH someone intervened, I wish I got an intervention because maybe that would‚Äôve woken me up much sooner. I finally was able to quit around November of last year and it was cold turkey for a while, then I told myself I have self control now and it‚Äôs fine so I smoked and it was HORRIBLE. I got so high (my tolerance used to be insanely high and now it‚Äôs like when I first started smoking) so I was able to stop smoking again for a while. And then I smoked again and it wasn‚Äôt too bad and I was able to enjoy it. 

But then my ex texted me and I smoked with my friend to clear my head. But then I smoked again to fall asleep. Then again. And again. I‚Äôve smoked weed four times now just this week and I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm falling off the wagon and getting back to my old ways.

Getting sober literally saved my life. Because of it, I was able to enroll in school and pursue law school. I was able to repair all the broken relationships I had because of my addiction. I was able to finally grow up and get my suit together. I had a routine; I had a plan. Everything was fine. 

I‚Äôm losing control and I‚Äôm starting to tell myself it‚Äôs fine if I smoke at night. It was only supposed to be one night and now I just want to smoke. All the fucking time. It‚Äôs hard to admit I‚Äôm an addict like who the fuck wants to say that and it‚Äôs weed you know, who the fuck gets addicted to WEED. Idk I‚Äôm fighting so hard not to smoke rn but it‚Äôs an uphill battle I know I‚Äôm gonna lose.

Pls send good vibes or advice or something, I can‚Äôt go down this path again but I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt be able to stop. I‚Äôve missed it so much and I don‚Äôt want to stop but I know I have to. And none of my friends understand or take it seriously when I say I‚Äôm addicted.

I broke down over the weekend, and the breakdown ended with me driving my fist into a metal power box. I had been so overwhelmed and just wanted everything to stop.

For years I have tried to steamroll through life and band-aid my emotions. Weed has become one of those band-aids. What started as something social and leisurely, has ended as something isolating and destructive. 

I used to think - ‚Äúif I could be high all of the time, life would be amazing‚Äù, but I know this is not true. When the rose-coloured glasses wore off I‚Äôd be back to square one.

I surrendered my stash to my mum when I got home. As much as I felt I was losing an old friend, I had to part ways with it.

This is a trend I‚Äôve noticed with the quitting process. It‚Äôs very noticeable at first that you‚Äôre not smoking, and can almost seem unbearable. But as time goes on you will lose the need to be high and it gets to the point that you don‚Äôt even think about it anymore. It‚Äôs funny how it works. I have definitely benefitted from quitting: finically, emotionally, and mentally. My bank account looks better, my emotions are far more controlled, my mental state is clearer. Something I‚Äôve been really surprised by is my better mood. When I was smoking I had a lot of moments where I became very angry and frustrated. I think it‚Äôs because a high is always waining and we have to keep smoking to chase that feeling we‚Äôre after. Now I barely lose my temper. I‚Äôm in the moment and I can handle things so much better, I‚Äôm not panicking when something goes wrong and running to get high. Life‚Äôs challenges require us to be present.

Now, I nip those thoughts in the bud (hee, hee). Now I think, yes I could get high, and I would feel good for an hour or two, but then will **need** to get high again, and again, and again, and I would quickly go back to the all-day every-day misery that I struggled to escape from.

I‚Äôve been clean for 24 days now. I had never made it past two weeks but this time I knew it was different. The past few days I was with a close friend who smoked a few times during each of the days I was there. He has medical reasons for it and kept it away from me so he was totally respecting of my change. But for the first time in these 3 and a half weeks I truly got that urge to smoke again because I knew it was right there if I wanted it. And I didn‚Äôt even come close. That is why I feel comfortable now in writing this as my journey has truly been solidified after not submitting to those urges. I see a lot on this thread about the mental health impacts of long term smoking. I am here to discuss the physical ones. I hope that someone reading this finds some inspiration. This is as much for me as it is for you. 

I started smoking weed at the age of 19 and by 22 was a heavy smoker. I am now 32. I had various reasons for smoking when I was younger, beyond the recreational fun of it, that are now no longer an issue (mainly depression). By my mid to late 20‚Äôs I found the only reason I was still smoking was to escape the chronic pain that I have been battling for a decade. To summarize the chronic pain I would just say that various parts of my body hurt and with most of them no one can figure out why. That‚Äôs a story for another day. I‚Äôve come to a place where I no longer want to just run away and escape my pain. I want to live my best life and sobriety may bring some direct and indirect answers to my pain. For me marijuana would create a vicious cycle of bad habits/impacts on my health. This is that cycle‚Ä¶.

I am sober and it is dinner time. I overeat as I know right after the meal I can smoke to clear up the full feeling in my stomach.

I smoke and now my stomach feels better. I eat again.

I wake the next day and have a foggy mind due to smoking from the night before. I drink coffee. 

I am high before dinner time to clear up my acidic stomach from the coffee.

I smoke and now my stomach feels better. I eat the same oversized dinner as last night.

My throat now hurts from the smoking. I drive to the 7/11 to get a sugary drink to soothe my throat. I also buy candy while there. I smoke, eat, and smoke and now my stomach feels better.

I wake the next day and have a foggy mind due to smoking from the night before. I drink coffee. Now my stomach hurts right away from the previous night‚Äôs food and that morning‚Äôs coffee. I smoke that morning.

I am high all day and eat not only an oversized dinner but now an oversized lunch. My throat still hurts so I go to 7/11 and get a sugary drink and also cough drops. I‚Äôm now working on cavities in my teeth from the smoking. 

The smoking, coffee, and overeating continue. I now have acid reflux. 

I eat an oversized dinner late and get high. I lay down and fall asleep. The acid reflux destroys me overnight and my chest starts to hurt. I don‚Äôt sleep very well.

The smoking, coffee, and overeating continue. To combat the acid reflux that night I sleep sitting up in a bad position. My neck/upper back starts to hurt. 

I get high to escape. 

I‚Äôve gain 40 pounds from all this. My back gets worse. I smoke to escape that.

I drink coffee and that makes my anxiety worse. 

I now have tinnitus likely from anxiety about my health. When I get high that gets worse. Now I can‚Äôt escape that one while high.

It all continues and worsens. I get high to escape as much as I can. 

All the things I should be doing for my health I don‚Äôt do because I can just escape it. I get high.

All the things I should not be doing for my health I am clearly doing. I am high. 

Now I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs what from the smoking or what was there before. I am now depressed again. I get high to escape that. 

This is the vicious cycle.   

I have broken the vicious cycle. I‚Äôm sober now and still have a long road to go but am finally on my path. The cycle summarized above has played out for years. I only touched on many of the physical things but left out all the psychological, financial, social, and career implications of my bad habit. Again it is a vicious cycle.

I am sober but am not escaping anything anymore. I am on the right journey. I am a survivor. I can do this. I am Becoming.

Remember before you got in a relationship with an ex, you were most likely doing okay and enjoyed your life and hobbies. 

When you first broke up, oh boy did it sting, and suddenly all you could think about was every single positive thing that happened and suddenly they were an angel walking on earth that did nothing bad to you. 

Then, some times goes by, a few weeks... months... and eventually you realise not only are you fine, and happy again.. but realise that you were not meant to be with that person - clearly otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt have split up.

Of course this doesn‚Äôt correlate in every aspect, especially if you got dumped, but if you got dumped then that person wasn‚Äôt the one and you‚Äôve had to deal with it and move on.

Weed is like a comfortable but unhealthy relationship, where you‚Äôre clouded by the positives and ignore the negatives. Try and remember any negative feelings or experiences you had whilst smoking weed and use that as motivation to stop.

For me, I can remember being paranoid that I was doing things to hurt/ distance myself fromfriends, or even just making up crazy scenarios of how anything in my life could go wrong. I also remember the times where after a long night of smoking, I would feel so incredibly ill, my throat would feel all closed up and tight.. and I‚Äôd wonder why I‚Äôd bothered getting so stoned - yet go back to it the next day.

Think of your wallet!!! I‚Äôve realised over ~5 years smoking that I‚Äôd spent 10k+ ATLEAST on weed - and not to mention the silly amount I‚Äôve spent on food at the same time.

Remember the times before you got into smoking and remember that there is a version of yourself that doesn‚Äôt need to be high.

Big love.

(Just as a side note - I have now not smoked in 6 weeks, and have used many things as motivation and small/ big reasons to stop. I started a new job where I need to be energetic and proactive. I also realised that I was allowing myself to go on dates as the idea of meeting someone new and having a great time seemed nerve racking when either stoned or ‚Äòganj-overed‚Äô from the night before. In the last 2 weeks a friend who I used to smoke with has offered me a joint twice, including last night, and the feeling of being able to say no is something that makes me so proud - and you can do it too. Honestly at first I thought the idea of seeing my friends who had taken a break from weed, starting smoking again as a reason why I could allow myself to smoke again. However, the opposite has happened. Now I know that it shows me how strong I have been not to give in. Sure I still get cravings, but I acknowledge that my will power is stronger than that craving and then move on, have a coffee.)

2021-02-21 05:04:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lou225/a_fairytale_that_has_to_end/,A fairytale that has to end,"Where to start?
I started smoking weed when i was 15/16 with school friends, usually just once in a blue moon.
Gradually the weekly sessions became, 2 times a week, 3 times etc. 
Eventually smoking almost everyday. I just wanted to escape, felt very atypical to the rest of me peers and it made me feel like i was an alien and something, and cannabis made me forget the world and how bad i felt.
Eventually the years went on and I kept smoking. 

I have had smaller breaks, like a few weeks, a month here and there, but I always end back on the pipe.
Weed helped me escape my problems but didnt show me how to solve them, and now it doesnt even help me escape anymore.
I have wasted time, money and possibilities just to get high, and all my weed friends, have used me to get weed and smoke at my place(cause they cant smoke at home in case parents see them), so eventually it was always me taking on the responsibilty and bad rep for smoking, while they could pretend to their close ones that they didnt. I have decided to let those people go, they only need me when they want something from me. And these friends have betrayed me countless times(not regarding to weed) , and made me feel even worse. But low confidence and empathy have made me too forgiving, which people have exploited. 

Point being is that im done bending over for other people , and I will prioritize myself from now on. 
I wish them all the best, but I dont need people in my life only because i can give them a place to smoke.


Enough of the soap story, i just know in my heart that I have to change, because my saviour has become my crutch, a crutch that never fullfills anything.
But besides those damaged relationships, i have let too much potential go up in smoke, literally üòÑ. 

I regret ever putting a joint in my mouth, If I could tell my younger self something, it would be "" dont do it, it will not solve that void in your heart, and eventually it will only make it worse"" 

I have become an addict, and if I dont stop now, then i can only imagine in 5 years more of doing this, will spiral negatively quickly. By making this decision, I hope to vindicate some of my lost potential, and making a good future life for my girlfriend and I. 

So this is to another day 1, but this time with different motivation. 
I cant believe how much life I have let go to waste. But luckely there is plenty more life ahead. 
I just know that if i dont quit now, then I wont ever achieve the goals i have. Im no longer cavalier with my time, and sick and tired of running away. Only one way to go, and thats onwards and upwards! Good luck to you all, I hope we will all prevail in the end. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I know it sounds like i feel pity for myself, but I dont. 
I have decided to do all of these things, and i let people exploit me. If anything im just angry that I let myself be so weak for so many years. But im a bit scared of the up coming weeks withdrawel, hopefully I can stay strong.

For the good of my wallet, my motivation and all the good things that come from sobriety, I am sincerely trying. In addition, I live in Australia so it is actually illegal in my country.

However, I'm dating/living with someone who smokes. I also have a housemate that smokes. Their smoking is a constant temptation.

Throughout the week I am working full-time. So it's mostly not a problem, but the weekends are brutal. The temptation has been so strong. Also, my partner is generally baked the entire weekend, so getting her to come outside or engage in meaningful conversation has been challenging.

When we were both smoking, I felt ""on her level"", if that makes sense. However, now that I'm not smoking, my desire to spend time with her has diminished significantly. Even worse, sometimes I want to get high just so I can be high with her.

Can relationships with one person smoking work? What can I do to solve this difference without being preachy or controlling. I wish we'd both just quit, but I want her to do it for herself and I don't want to nag her about it.

I got that tip from a coworker which i told that i quit bevause i've heard from him that he had to quit too. He said ""the most important thing for you to do is to stop buy weed. Even if you smoke with your friends after some time resist the urge to call your plug or you'll fall straight back""
That helped me. Because it made it ""okay"" to relapse with friends.

2021-02-20 23:50:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lopb5f/at_the_6_month_mark_and_ive_learned_a_lot/,At the 6 month mark and I've learned a lot...,"This is the longest I've gone without smoking weed in probably 4 years, since my first year of college, and it feels very strange. One thing is for sure though and that is I'm very grateful for this sub because I feel much better off without weed. My head is clearer and I've had time to reflect. I haven't posted here much other than when I first started back in August, but I thought I'd write this out as a way of marking my progress.

1. Sitting with one's emotions is hard. Really hard. Weed is just one of many ways that one can pick up as a way to avoid feeling those emotions. This was definitely my case. As someone who didn't have a safe family environment or good friends growing up who I could be honest with about my emotions, I developed a habit of ignoring or denying my own emotions. Unfortunately this had very damaging consequences. I was always confused by my actions or ashamed and I couldn't explain why. When I was upset, I would smoke weed, as if that would help. This habit made opening up in therapy extremely difficult. The only way to move past the tough cards we've been dealt in life is to fully acknowledge the way we feel and accept it. This is easier said than done and probably takes a lifetime to learn. But habitually smoking weed only gets in the way of that.
2. It's so easy to be inauthentic to your true self. The most corny advice we always hear is to ""just be yourself."" I didn't realize that putting this advice into practice is fairly difficult for someone who hasn't received a lot of affirmations for being who they are. Before college, I had no interest in smoking weed. I was a nerdy kid and I was happy with that. I enjoyed my classes, learned in my free time, and didn't have a problem with being more on the margins socially because I felt happy with who I was. When I got to college, everyone was nerdy so I felt like I needed to change somehow to be socially accepted. I went to parties, drank, and eventually smoked weed regularly because I thought it made me a fun, outgoing person that people would want to be friends with. And it did. But I wasn't me. I lost that intellectual curiosity and zest for life that I had before. I became disillusioned with college and life in general. I had friends that I talked to regularly, but I always held back the most important personal things. Months later after college, it's no surprise that I only keep in touch with a handful of those friends and still am rather selective about what I share. Showing up as your authentic self is a prerequisite for intimacy. And I learned from experience that the appearance of friends and fun doesn't equate to that being the reality.
3. Willful blindness is very real. It's amazing the things we can make ourselves believe, despite the evidence. I told myself so many times that my weed usage wasn't a ""problem."" I even talked to my therapist about this and shared details in a way that would make her agree, that it wasn't a ""problem."" But deep down I knew that was a lie. I survived college, when I could have been thriving. It's true that with anything, you get out what you put in. And I put in the bare minimum of effort, treating school like an extracurricular. My social life--which consisted of meeting up with people throughout the week to smoke, being high the entire weekend and going to parties--was my main priority. If I had taken a moment to pause and look at how I was spending my time and money and been honest with myself, I'm sure I would have realized sooner that weed was indeed a problem.
4. There's value in everything. This is something that I'm currently working on. I'm trying not to see my college years as a waste of time. I did get a lot out of the experience. I did meet some great people and had many great experiences. Going forward, I really need to change my mindset about life. When I was stuck in the loop of high after high, I felt like I was watching life pass me by and the world was a depressing place. It's time for me to claim my agency and act on the world so that it's no longer a depressing place, at least in pockets.

Basically for me, what really made quitting weed difficult was the fear of facing the withdrawals, my problems, and finally stepping out of my comfort zone. Even though it was hard at first, but everyday this last month has been a journey. 

Despite a minor relapse, I was able to keep my eyes on the end result which gave me the strength and willpower not to fall back. I may have taken 2 steps back but I took 5 steps forward after that.

Conquering the fear of what life would be like after I quit made me feel like superman! It made me more curious to what the world has to offer. 

I have to say though, weed did push me to do many things, just as long it was my last stop with anything I did. But now that I can see past it, I am no longer scared, and more spontaneous and more open minded, I feel more blissful than ever!

For the last two years I only smoked a joint or two a night, after I‚Äôd got all my shit done. I liked to see myself as a ‚Äòresponsible stoner‚Äô, but there was always times where I‚Äôd wake and bake, even before work, or smoke silly amounts on weekends.

There wasn‚Äôt a chance in HELL you could stop me from smoking daily. For 4 years I didn‚Äôt have a SINGLE day off. I truly believed I could not get a wink of sleep without it. At some points, I literally had no appetite unless I‚Äôd smoked. The classic dependant stoner, you may say.

So I went on again very recently, for a couple of months, thanks to injury, then off when I no longer needed it. Big mistake to go back.

Every night for the past week. WORST nightmares of my life. None of them are about cheesy horror movie monster type of deals. All of it is incredibly targeting towards my deepest insecurities. Some of them are INVENTING insecurities I don‚Äôt even properly have, almost as if to try and force me to have them. It feels like being mind-molested by my own brain and/or the weed‚Äôs residual effects on it.

I have OCD and there are two well known ways you can have it. One is the typical constantly washing the doorknob - physical germophobia/contamination fear, if something isn‚Äôt clean you‚Äôll lose it. The other way is invisible to others, you‚Äôre constantly *morally* washing off your mind, checking for negative behaviors or thinking you‚Äôre ‚Äúsecretly a bad person and just didn‚Äôt know it‚Äù or some ridiculousness like that - like moral germophobia/contamination fear lmao. A lot of OCD people have a blend of the two. I have that but much more of the second kind.

So basically, I‚Äôm thinking weed w/d is massively combining with that to mindfuck me in the worst way possible.

Other times I quit is was way harder and I have so much respect for everyone here on trying. The way it differs so much from person to person is really interesting. 

To be honest I do not know why I smoked the past year. Once I started hallucinating on weed one and a half year back I just did not enjoy it anymore. While high I am anxious, insecure, silent, hallucinating like hell and in a really intense headspace. More intense than LSD or other psychedelics.

I still did it everyday. Although only in the evening I still smoked around a gram a day. To go to sleep or chill after work with friends.

I have to say that I (think) I do not smoke to escape from anything. I like my life, work 7 days a week, am very social and have a pretty long relationship with my wonderfull girlfriend. As I said I do not know why I still continued for so long. I did not enjoy it, was a worse person while on it daily and still did it because everyone did and I loved how weed once was (like most of you feel/felt it). It was a big hobby and everyone did it. It was who I was and I kinda took it for granted. I live in Holland and weed is very very normal here. Not a sterio type at all.. Maybe that is why I still did it, because it seemed so normal and was part of the daily routine. After work going to a coffeeshop and getting a gram of something tasty. I did enjoy the taste very much.

Always after a long time of daily smoking I am just done with it. I feel so tired, insecure, down and unmotivated. No passion for life, and just depressed in corona time.
Than I quit and I experience pretty intense psysical withdrawal. Like waking up every your bathing in sweat. Cold sweats all day, smelling like weed and such.

But still, after a day of 10 I was with friends and just thought why not. And I started a new daily habit for months.

11 days back, or 12 idk, I was again with this sadness, depression and just wanted to be energetic and happy like I was before I smoked. I just cried in my girlfriend's arms and quit that day.

Since then I did not want to smoke even one time in the day. Everyone still does it next to me, in my room with my grinder. I just do not want it. I even start to hate the smell  and ask them to smoke out of my window. Only at night, because of the insomnia, I want to smoke sometimes. Not to feel weed, because it feels horible, but just to sleep. 

I kind of feel odd, reading most experiences here. And I am very interested in simular experiences here. I see so many people having such different stories, and I hope you all find a way to quit. I don't want to make it sound like it's easy. The withdrawals really suck. Have not slept well since I quit but it's getting a bit better. Just that I am so done with it I do not crave it anymore. I really hope that I can be clean this time. And finally feel that happyness again that I felt before I started. I love life, and can't wait to start again.

Good luck to everyone, please respond with simular experiences or anything else, I hope you can do this. I love you",6,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43314144}"

I did a home renovation one time, got better jobs during two others, and even sober time when I haven‚Äôt made major accomplishments give me more bandwidth for friends and family to develop those relationships.

When I am smoking, everything but my work life decays. I manage to stay sober long enough for a productive work day, but take a hit as soon as it‚Äôs quitting time.

Which brings me to my current dilemma. I am on day 2 and am struggling. Sometimes it‚Äôs easier than others for reasons and this time is rough. I also have a very high pressure presentation on Tuesday.

I‚Äôm afraid that with Tuesday being only day 5, I may actually perform more poorly than I would otherwise due to withdrawals and lack of sleep.

I am an addict and my life is kinda outta of control,"I'm 33 years old. Going on 34. I have been smoking since I was 20. About 12 years as a daily smoker with a six month sober patch at the beginning of 2020. 

I went to a rehab to quit and stayed there for two weeks. When I got out I was determined never to go back. I made it for 6 months before I went back hard. 

My life is a tale of caution to all you good people wishing to quit.

I have been married twice in this time and divorced twice. Before that I lost a long term relationship because I lied about my smoking and quitting. 

My entire life has been a double life. I was a functional addict at some point but, as some of you may know, the longer you are an addict the less functional you become.

I am a professional. An attorney. In my contries there is some prestige in doing this work and alot of people want to do it,  it should also mean I find work easily and have a well paid job. 

But I'm not rich or wealthy! In fact about the only achievement I have in life is an adult is passing my degree and the bar exam and becoming an attorney. I don't know how i did this whilst basically being high all the time.

So I have never been very motivated to begin with and weed just killed all of my ambition and motivation. I have never made more then 700 dollars a month before 2018. 

Then in 2018 I got divorce from my first wife. It was my fault. I started growing marijuana and that pissed her off. I started spending all my time with my friends and with my plants and eventually this drove her away. It wasn't the main reason but it was definitely a part of it.

I moved to another city in May 2018 and Joined a friend in their law practice. So I essentially became self employed as I what ever fees I made I kept and I paid only half the office expenses.  Despite this I still haven't progressed much.

In Sept 2018 I met my second wife and we got married in January 2019. Too quick, I know. We promptly did not get along and we ended up fighting almost every day. She made me promise to quit smoking eventually and she asked me to go to rehab. I did and I made it clean 6 months. 

During those 6 months I thought things would be good for my wife and I and we moved into our own place after staying with my parents for just over a year. 

We still fought, about everything else and my marriage was quickly ending. I said to hell with it I needed to be happy and I started smoking again. Guess what? My wife asked me to do a random drug test one day and I was busted. 

She promptly left and came back. The day of my birthday we fought souch and she packed her stuff to leave. I went to smoke and she left and Neve came back. 

To this day she hates my business partner and feels I will never amount to anything there. 

The point of this entire story is that I have smoked throughout it. It has caused so much of pain for myself and for the prowl I claim to love. 

I am 33 going on 34.

I am far behind all my peers. Many have those fancy jobs and earn good money. 

I work in a single office for myself. I have no savings, I have no medical aid, I have no pension and I am always broke.

I forget to do things and my work is never done and up to date. I would much rather smoke then make an attempt to fix this thing that is my life. 

I'm not saying Marijuana is the cause of all my problems. But it sure is not helping. 

As I sit here I have tried to quit by myself twice this month. The most I made it was 2 days. 

I don't know what else to say. I am so tired of being here. Alone and lonely. I miss my ex wife and it hurts that I threw away my marriage for weed . 

I fight continually with my family. They keep telling me to stop smoking and turn to God. I guess they don't know what it is like. Not one of them has ever touched any addictive substance ever. But I basically am in a constant state of conflict with everyone and everything in my life. 

I have no prospects, I have a shitty dead end job my friend gave me because no real company will ever employ me and she isn't there for half the day. I smoke whatever I make. I live with my parents and I have destroyed every serious relationship I have ever been in.

And I know the truth. I know alot of my problems stem from my addiction. Not everyone, but alot of them do. 

I want to stop but I don't want to stop. Tonight I was at dinner at a friend's place and I couldn't go to my weed shop as it was closed by the time I left. I came home an scrapped every bottom of every bankey just to have something to smoke.

This is my life. A life of unfulfilled potential, alone and loneliness. Filled with friends who smoke as my only support. 

Ppl who see nothing wrong with the fact that they smoke everyday too. My friends are more addicted then I am. At least I can admit I have a problem. They didn't even understand why I went to rehab.

And my ex wife she is at her home. A mental wreck after our marriage. She used to casually smoke when we met. She no longer smoked after my rehab. She blames me for her life and what a mess it is now.

But hey, I still smoke. Because there is nothing wrong with a little smoke is there?

My name is Anthony , I‚Äôm 20 years old and I‚Äôve been a heavy pot smoker for about 3-4 years , and I‚Äôve been smoking pot mixed with tobacco for 5 years. 

It was only last night , in a massive hysterical fit of rage and immense remorse . Was I able to come to the conclusion that my life is a real fucking mess.

I‚Äôve been smoking 3-4 grams daily mixed with tobacco. 
Not too sound negative and petty , but this smoking habit has entirely destroyed all forms of motivation in my life. 
I‚Äôm barely skateboarding anymore 
I‚Äôm barely playing basketball anymore 
Just sitting in bed all day and being depressed as fuck. Whilst my smoking definitely doesn‚Äôt improve this at all. 


It was only last night that I accepted the fact that I need help .
Smoking so much pot for so long can really cloud your vision and rational thinking so heavily . 

I‚Äôve also come to realise that most of the buzz in smoking , comes from the anticipation of it all. 
For example : chopping the weed up , making the mix , and smoking the bong , these are activities i look forward too . Not even getting high .... 


All negativity aside . 

I‚Äôve only come to realise last night , that if I want to break this shitty horrific habit in my life entirely . 
I‚Äôm going to have to be honest with myself . And try my best not too beat myself up over it . 

And In order to achieve this , I‚Äôm going to have to develop a new perspective on life. A new ‚Äúfinesse‚Äù if you will. 

Amongst my personal observations . I‚Äôve also taken into consideration how important my attitude and perspective is . When it comes too quitting . 

The quitter has to be highly tolerant with the right attitude . 
I‚Äôm not going to quit smoking pot , by laying in bed all day feeling fucking sorry for myself . 

It‚Äôs all about accountability and not falling victim too my own vices such as sugar , smoking and porn .

Here are my withdrawal symptoms:

- Hot flashes
- Excessive sweating/night sweats
- No appetite
- Mild nausea
- Irritability
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Low fevers (~99 F)
- Shortness of breath

Are all of these symptoms normal? I have a history of cancer and some of these symptoms can be a sign of relapse. The likelihood of that is probably less than 1% and would be a huge coincidence that it coincided with me quitting.

After a rocky start I adjusted to living without weed and had seen my life improve in many ways. On this day I allowed myself to think that I had ‚Äúbeaten‚Äù weed and that if I wanted to smoke on a special occasion I could. Knowing I was going to be glued to the tv that night I made a poor choice to go to the dispensary and get a gram of dope.........

Instead of a gram I ended up getting an 1/8th, I mean it was only like 10 bucks more. So now before even smoking, my planned one time thing had turned into a planned one night binge, with every intention to throw any unsmoked weed away when I went to bed that night. I don‚Äôt have to tell you that I didn‚Äôt smoke the whole bag watching election returns, and I didn‚Äôt throw what was left away - everyone here reading this already knows that......

The next day I woke up feeling guilty for the slip and remembered that I still had weed left and that I said I was going to flush it. Within 10 minutes I was smoking, didn‚Äôt even get a cup of coffee in me beforehand. Despite my good intentions by mid day I was online ordering more weed. Now it was going to be until the end of the week instead of just one night. I mean, does it matter? If it was going to take me a month to get clean I might as well indulge myself a little bit, as long as I don‚Äôt let it go longer than I planned, right?....

That ‚Äúone time thing‚Äù was over 3 months ago and in the days since then I have smoked 24/7 and spent over $1200 on weed, and was actually using a lot more than I had before I quit - so by all measures I am worse off that I was before. Last night I threw everything away, unlike last time I threw away my gear and paraphernalia instead of just storing it. 

I am unemployed due to Covid and know that I will never get back to where I need to be, or will end up in a bad job that I take out of desperation if I don‚Äôt stop and stay stopped.  So today I recommit myself to sobriety from marijuana. I am ashamed of myself for this months long slip and binge, but the only thing worse would be to do nothing about it.  Thanks for reading and stay strong. 

TL/DR: I ruined a solid 6 month sobriety streak by smoking ‚Äúonce‚Äù which has turned into a hardcore 3 month binge. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT QUITTING USING EVEN ONCE TO TRULY OPENS THE DOOR TO A FULL ON RELAPSE.

Honestly I'm feeling sort of defeated. I'm not considering smoking again or anything like that. I don't really have any cravings or urges anymore. I can drive my brother to the dispensary and I don't even consider buying any. But man. I just thought there would be *more* after 60 days.

After I hit 30 days I was feeling on top of the world. I was building better habits, living a healthier lifestyle, and getting shit done. A lot of people here have talked about the ""newly sober"" high and that's definitely what I was feeling. The novelty of the change was still exciting and energizing to me.

As I've settled into soberness more I just feel... tired? Lol. I haven't been as consistent with my new habits in the last 30 days than I was in the first 30. I still feel stupid and don't have as much mental clarity as I hoped I would. Part of it is definitely that I'm finishing my last semester of undergrad, taking 4 hard classes, dealing with pandemic fatigue, fearing the future after graduation and still don't have a job lined up, dealing with anxiety/depression/ etc.. I think being sober is at least helping me *deal* with all of that properly? At the very least I'm learning how to get the shit kicked out of me and stand back up instead of crawling to weed and forgetting about everything.

I was trying to put this in perspective the other day. I smoked for exactly 7 years which is 2,555 days if you don't count leap years. I've been sober for 60 days which means I've been newly sober for only 2.35% of the time that I spent high. Building a new life takes time. If I want the things I say I wanted from soberness, those aren't going to all come right away after only 2.35%. I need to get to 3%, and then 4%, one day at a time and have faith that I really can undo whatever damage was done.

I wanna stop. Im gonna stop. I lost the ability to control negative feelings (though Im getting better). But as I stay in TX and this winter storm made me realize Im much more innovative than I thought.

Dad got killed at a young age (13) and that took a part of me. Heart broke like an artery missing. So 2 years after that, I started smoking weed. Lead me to self destruction etc. But Im good now but doing weed so long  I do it as regularly as blinking. $$$ being spent on it rather than something more productive or even save. I hate it.

So Sunday was when the storm started. Snowed in w gf and no water (somehow we were in the fortunate part of Austin who kept power). (I smoke weed by my patio door and throw my roaches on the concrete by my door so) Tuesday I noticed 8-9 roaches on the ground and rolled it all in a new joint (felt kinda fiend-ish but hey). High died down and I felt hopeless knowing the roads were iced over bad and couldn't get none which kept me sober. I thought to myself I would stop cuz I hate that needy feeling of it. 

Going off water bottles and running to our last, we had to think how to get water.  Me and my gf came up collectively with a gameplan:

1. Get two big tubberware totes (not food but big like for Xmas decor)
2. Fill with snow.
3. Boil snow down in big pot. (Bring to a rolling boil for 5 mins [this isn't my first rodeo with citywide boil water notices])
4. Filter thru big bath towel in a big cooler
5. Pour in clean big pot and boil.
6.Filter in new clean towel in another bowl.


REPEAT 5 & 6

Boom! Water. 

I was proud of myself that I was sober and didnt smoke a joint (which take about 15 20 mins) and think of that poorly. Rather than, I got in a QB huddle like Tom Brady with gf and came up with that like in 5 minutes. [Just to think,  how much time wasted smoking weed(for 15 years) vs thinking (or ultimately abandoning it).

It is Friday (Day #3) and the roads are clearing fast. Not gonna lie. Urges are through the roof but Im so dedicated.  Im not about to let this forced head start be in vain.

TL:DR Dad got killed. Picked up weed as a vice that lasted 15 years. Winter storm hit TX as our country arses aren't equipped for it. No weed. Able to figure out a solution for no water. Decide I dont need it.

When going thru hell, KEEP GOING!
Dont ask the devil for a blunt.

recently i found an old thc vape i had and was back to smoking a hit at night before bed. then someone told me about delta 8 thc being legal and less intense so i read a lot about it and bought a lot of them a few weeks ago and i've just been smoking them through the day. originally i thought they are amazing because it's without all of the anxiety and heart racing pot causes... but i get so reliant on it. it doesn't even effect me much except i can tell that i'm using it to cope with my life that has been very difficult. i don't need to go through it but i have a lot of past trauma and health issues (like serious ones).

the worst part is i'm breast feeding a toddler  while using the delta 8 thc. i cannot get them weaned because i feel like i am being selfish if they aren't ready and it's the only way they'll go to bed at night.... and once they fall asleep then i'm off to my d8 vape and watching movies or whatever (me time). originally a dr told me this is fine, i read about studies. then i was overtaken with guilt and shame and self hatred because my toddler is the most beautiful, smart child and i hate the possibility i could alter her brain.

so today i've told myself no more. and i haven't. but i feel a lot of shame still, pain, sickness (I'm missing a lot of my intestine from a freak accident/surgery).

The withdrawals this past week have been my worst ever. Felt like total dogshit the first 4 days -- headache (I generally NEVER get headaches, it's literally been years), and feeling very fatigued.

Yesterday was okay, but today I got the headache and cloudiness again. I thought about taking just a tiiiiiiny hit, so I could get rid of the headache, but then I had a better idea: I worked out.

I played the drums and worked up a sweat, then I lifted some dumbbells. Feeling tired now, but headache is gone. I'm so glad I didn't cave.

I smoked almost every day for the best part of 3 years in my early 20s. Towards the end of this, I wasn't even enjoying it anymore; it just made me anxious, but safe to say I was addicted. I also had no motivation whatsoever. I would sit at work waiting to go home so I could smoke again. I'd tried to quit several times but always came back. I wasn't in a happy place mentally and it was my crutch. Eventually I found the strength to completely quit.

For a while after quitting, I was terrified that I'd caused myself permanent brain damage. I had a degree and a job that required me to use my brain a lot, but I felt like I was just stupid. I couldn't even hold a proper conversation without zoning out and losing interest. This was having a massive effect on my work. I'd spend entire days sitting at my desk pretending to work, because I was too anxious to go and talk to someone I needed to talk to in order to get something done.

Fast forward to today. The brain fog is gone. My brain is sharp as ever. I can confidently hold conversations with people at work and outside. I'm as motivated as I've ever been, and have taken on projects outside my job to make extra money (time I otherwise would've spent smoking). I've moved on in my career, and successfully managed a project last year that I never could've dreamed of doing before. My whole outlook on life has changed. I'm enjoying the struggle and challenge of setting and achieving meaningful, useful goals.

I hope this doesn't come off preachy, I'm just trying to show how much better off and happier I am for having quit. To anyone who is thinking of quitting, or is in early days, I say this: It's all worth it.

I was nervous I would get caught the entire time, but I didn‚Äôt. Something clicked in my brain, and I just figured I could get away with it. 

I started to go to work high every shift. It definitely effected my work. I smoked so much, my budget couldn‚Äôt keep up with it. It all came to a head when I started stealing from the register. At first I just took 20$, then the second time it was 50$. But my job was a very small company, and they immediately started looking into the shortages. I was so nervous they would figure out it was me I simply left the job. 

But my next job wasn‚Äôt much better. It was for a much larger retail chain. It didn‚Äôt take any time at all for me to start going to work high again. Somehow no one noticed. The pay was a lot better, but I was still spending so much on weed I didn‚Äôt really have much money for anything else. I started stealing from the register again. This time I took more, maybe like 100$ each shift. It wasn‚Äôt long before I had stolen easily over 1200$. Somehow I never got caught, and I left the job soon after. But I still live in fear that I‚Äôm going to get a call from the police any day now. 

My third job was a really relaxed job where everyone got high during work, so you can imagine how my weed spending skyrocketed. Plus the pay was amazing compared to what I had before, so at least I didn‚Äôt steal. But I didn‚Äôt stay at that job for very long, and soon I was jobless for months. 

I finally have a new job. It‚Äôs a really fun one, and there pay is pretty ok for my area. I‚Äôm not worried  that I‚Äôll start stealing again, but I am worried that I will start to go to work high, especially because everyone at work smokes (but not on the job).

I know this sub is for recovery and abstinence promotion but I want to see if anyone shares my thought process. I‚Äôve smoked every day for over 10 years now but have wanted to stop the whole time. Now I‚Äôve been able to control my urges to only having a spliff in the morning and vaping at night. I feel like I‚Äôm finding a balance that seems medicinal however in the back of my mind I know it‚Äôs not necessary for contentment.

The hardest part is that my partner is not willing to quit and I understand how self support can be the hardest thing when I can‚Äôt get support from my partner. My partner complains about the tobacco in my Spliff which amounts to, fuck, a half a teaspoon but will not take any criticism or suggestion that she should stop smoking weed. 

I‚Äôve told her that I‚Äôm not even sure who she is because I haven‚Äôt experienced her sober personality. I told her that we‚Äôre both using it like a crutch. She says it makes her happy and she wants to be happy but she needs it to do that. I counter by saying suppose you were happier if you weren‚Äôt dependent on it. Logic doesn‚Äôt seem to work. 

I know that if I quit then the chances of her quitting would be higher.

I wanna start off by saying yes this is my first post but this sub really helped me change my life back when I first quit. As the title says I‚Äôm 1 year and 1 month sober from smoking since i was 16 to 19 (currently 20). I smoked legal marijuana as a California resident and started off with smoking about 2-3 full gram cartridges from a dispensary until I was 18 where until I was 19 I only smoked tree or dabs. When i quit the first few weeks were horrible, but after that I felt fine. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just me but I felt extremely stupid after quitting, developed a stutter (which is kinda gone now), and just felt like a different person. I‚Äôd say my only advice for anyone on their journey is to cut out anything related to weed in your life if you wanna quit because that‚Äôs what I did and yes it is possible to do so, I‚Äôm saying that as someone who‚Äôs in a state where going to the bar is less popular then going to a smoke spot.

Now comes the issues I‚Äôm facing after a year clean. When I originally quit I didn‚Äôt feel any side affects after 3 months except one weird side effect. For some reason I constantly felt at random times throughout the day and night like my feet were numb, burning or the ‚Äúpins and needles‚Äù feeling. I figured it‚Äôd go away which it sorta did after the 10 month mark, but since the 10month mark I feel it here and there sometimes. I saw people on here say it could be diabetes which I got checked out and I‚Äôm not pre-diabetic nor am I a diabetic. I also saw people talking about nerve damage which motivated me to go to 4 different foot & nerve specialists to find out nothing is wrong there. I feel completely fine no dere/personalization just the foot issue. It annoys me because I don‚Äôt want me smoking a plant to end up with me having a feeling till the day I die that it so annoying.

I've been smoking since I was 18. I'm 24 years old, and it seems like I can't remember a single thing from my adult life.

I wasn't a popular kid growing up, and in weed I found a way to escape reality. As time went on, I happened to land stable job, even though the salary ins't great, but apart from that, I haven't achieved a single feat.

Since the last 2 years, every time I smoke I start having very bad thoughts. I probably couldn't even count how many nights I promised myself I would stop, only to smoke weed first thing in the morning.

I've lost friends, I've lost my reputation, all because I couldn't resist smoking another joint. Hard to be a friend when you are so stoned you can't even function.

But my biggest shame is letting my family down. I live with my parents, and even though they haven't said anything, I know they know I smoke. I was a kid with a bright future, and I've let everyone down.

I am an astronomer,  and tonight i'm the assigned observer for telescope time my team has been awarded.  As you can imagine, this is done remotely due to covid. The procedure is simple enough, join the zoom call, connect to the VPN to access the GUI and from there upload your observing script.  I decided to be in charge of tonights ""driving"" of the telescope, even tho i did not have the scripts at hand and had my colleague to send them to me.  The email with the files wasn't coming and i was getting anxious, i decided to upload my own script that i had somewhere.  My colleague then realized i had uploaded the wrong script! we had to restart and in total, we lost about \~10 minutes of observing time, which believe me when i say it's a lot of time to be lost on big telescopes. I blame all of this on myself for deciding to get high two hours before my shift, thinking i would be ok by 2 AM (the time when we start observing)

2021-02-19 00:29:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ln7v0l/finally_quit/,Finally Quit,"The main reason I've stayed on Reddit are the stories of people, like me, struggling to quit marijuana. I first smoked with my adult daughter when I was 47 years old. I never really considered stopping until recently, when I realized I had become psychologically addicted to THC. I think my story is somewhat unique and I feel relatively safe to share it with others who find themselves in the same difficult circumstances.

I am a retired police officer and I had always believed that marijuana was a gateway drug to serious addiction problems. In the mid 1980's I was involved in a pretty serious gunfight that left one one suspect dead, one seriously wounded, and me near death when I was shot in the stomach with a .357 magnum revolver. Off for several months, I returned to police and continued to work patrol. About 2 1/2 years later, I was involved in a second gun fight. This time I shot a homicide suspect who had just wounded an off duty police officer and killed his companion, in a random driver by shooting. Shortly after my second shooting I began to develop serious symptoms of PTSD, which have continually plagued me to this day.

In December of 1992, I was assigned to the traffic division and fulfilled my lifelong dream of being a police motorcycle officer. On the 22nd, I was struck by a drunk driver, breaking my hip, both my arms, knocking out most of my teeth on the ride side of my face, and suffering a severe concussion. I never returned to the job and I was forced to retire at the age of 39.

8 years later, I started smoking pot, believing it to be an innocuous substance that could harmlessly help me with my extreme symptoms of PTSD and to deal with the constant pain in my hip, stomach, arms, and face. I was routinely high when I went back to college and obtained a teaching credential. While never high at work, I pursued a career as a middle school history teacher, eventually obtained a masters degree in educational leadership, and worked as a middle school principal. I stayed in education for 17 years, with 12 years as an administrator. During this time I had my medical card and I would routinely stay high during the weekends, believing it was the only way to control the stress and the PTSD.

2020 was just too much to deal with and I did not have one sober day during that time. I was lost in a fog and I believed that the only way I could cope was to be high. Riots, the presidential election, the pandemic, and the year long chaos only fed my desire to completely detach from reality. I had just retired when everything hit and all of our lives had been changed forever. I had began to spend a tremendous amount of money every month, buying from the top shelf, believing that life was too short to smoke shitty dope. Between my wife and I, we were going through more than $500 a month to maintain the habit we had both developed.

Then suddenly my daughter quit and after receiving some serious news from my doctor, I knew I needed to quit. This coming Monday, I will be one month clean and I have no intention of going back. I thought it worked for me and I can't say that I didn't have fun. Simply stated, I love the stuff, but I love my life more. I've lost weight, made better decisions, and enjoy my life so much more. I'm an addict and I had to quit. If I can do it at the tender age of 67, someone else out there struggling to quit, you can do it to. There is a whole community of people like me willing to help you back on your feet.

- working out, srsly... changes the game. doesn‚Äôt even have to b anything crazy, stretching will do. anything to get my body moving. 

- journaling/shadow work. i had to sit w my sober thoughts. i don‚Äôt always like to journal but sometimes i need to, so when i don‚Äôt want to journal i just use the voice memos app. i hit record and just start talking to myself. 

- taking medicine to get help w the headaches, fr. pls do not just suffer cus the headaches can be a bitch. 

- drinking water every time i got the urge to sm*ke. it helps w the hand / mouth movement and im drinking water so im nourishing my body. 

- i had to get a hobby. i found what was fun for me n i threw myself into it. i didn‚Äôt get it right the first time, i had to try a couple of different things. 

- i had to stop hanging w/ people who smoke. i realized i wasn‚Äôt missing out on anything, they are the ones missing out. 

- i had to set some goals. if i didnt reach them i just set some more and tried again. 

- WALKING. ik some of us are in the middle of this crazy winter storm but as soon as the sun comes out again i will be going back outside too. (u need the vitamin d. u don‚Äôt even have to walk, just sit outside and listen to some music and soak up the sun. this saved me. so good for depression and so good to get ur mind off sm*king)

- my pets. bonding w them. playing w them, letting them comfort me when i was feeling down. 

- making playlists for different vibes. study vibes. workout vibes. (the songs can‚Äôt mention sm*king tho LOL)

and now some advice from my personal experience:

the first week was the hardest. the second week was also hard, but way more manageable. if it wasn‚Äôt hard, everyone would be doing it. i had to accept that it was going to be a challenge. i had to make peace with the fact that this is hard work. but i had to congratulate myself for doing the work because not everyone is. 

i had to let myself grieve! if we*d was as big a part of your life as it was mine, it probably was your friend there for a little bit. but if you‚Äôre on this thread then you know that we*d has served it‚Äôs purpose and that there are bigger things waiting for you. i wrote a letter to we*d and said goodbye. i cried. i grieved the part of myself that was dependent on this substance. i had to grieve to properly and fully close the chapter. no one talks about that. 

i‚Äôm a bit of a control freak, so breaking my pieces and throwing out my stash never worked for me. i just decided i was going to quit and then let my willpower take over. that is the only thing that has ever worked for me. i knew i wasn‚Äôt going to go back to we*d once i decided to quit, but still having it... was comforting? i felt in control. granted, i had like .2 of a gr*m left so it wasn‚Äôt really anything. 

*this will NOT work for everyone, if you need to break your pieces and throw out your stash then do so. i just know it never worked for me and it may not work for you either, so i wanted to mention that.

I have already made the hardest choice, to stop for good. But now I‚Äôm wondering does the constantly high feeling ever end? I feel like I‚Äôm still high at all times and zoned out and not present in my body but watching things happen. It‚Äôs starting to scare me. I have only stopped smoking for two days so I know that has something to do with it. I guess I kind of wanted all high feelings to stop as soon as I made the decision but I know that‚Äôs not realistic. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for people to tell me it‚Äôs going to be okay and that this feeling does end and what you all did to help you get out of it. I‚Äôve seen it called permahigh or something like that. I‚Äôm really scared. I‚Äôve even started taking shots at night before bed to go to sleep/ to feel like I‚Äôm feeling this way for a REASON and not just residual high. Will I feel normal again? Please help me.

I know it‚Äôs probably the residual week in my system making me paranoid... I can‚Äôt live like this. I‚Äôm scared. I need help and advice please please please.


ETA: The support and reassurance I have received from you all is unfathomable. I feel so confident in myself and my ability to not only get through this tough time but to STAY sober. I feel like I can power through the next few weeks or so knowing that this feeling DOES have an end even if it feels like it‚Äôs my life forever. I still feel a little panicky just because I‚Äôm currently experiencing it but to see you all on the other side and going through the same things is so inspiring. I appreciate your comments so much and you really don‚Äôt know how much it means to me. I was feeling really alone because all of my Friends and even my husband is a really heavy smoker and no one has any intentions of stopping. I‚Äôm glad I found this place.

I am really wanting to address this now after having alcohol issues that eclipsed the issue for a long time i am now sober... Ive been sober for larger of the past 8 yrs despise a few relapses. But the weed has always remained a constant. And I can't put the bloody stuff down. After experiencing where drinking got me, which was painfully unstable, alone, and unable to function, ive found it hard to apply the same principles to my weed use, because hey, i get drunk and i get arrested. I sleep with whoever. I hurt the people closest to me.
When I smoke I go to sleep. That's it.

But I'm starting to really see THAT IS THE PROBLEM. For me weed dosent really have an explicitly negative impact on my life, it dosent make me a danger to myself and others like alcohol did. But it DOES create an illusion of having a positive impact. I feel relaxed, creative, blah blah. I can switch off. 
Which is great, but it does something else too. In taking away my discomforts it also takes my motivation to address the circumstances causing these uncomfortable feelings.  They're gone, I dont need to push thru my discomfort, or learn anything about myself, or grow. I can just sit here and relax.

After many years of weed being my default solution to life I feel like I'm only half formed in some ways. I've stagnated and slipped through the years trying to keep up instead of grown up. I dont know who I am, what i enjoy or where i fit in the world because I've never sat with my feelings long enough to want to find out.

Ive been lurking here for a while now.  I deal with my alcohol issue via a 12 step group as some of you may have guessed from my post. I don't share my struggles with weed there but I am interested to hear from anyone else who has been abstinent from alcohol for a period prior, and is/has/wants to stop using weed now too just to share experiences and maybe support each other a bit.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4663355}"

I know that's a weird image, but that's what it feels like. That's a good idea for a drawing. Anyways, weed shows me what I am insecure about in a way that is too intense for me to overcome it.

I made it through two months of quarantine with a 4 and 1 yo while working full time before I lost it and picked up my bong again. Now here we are, 8 months later, and I really want to quit. Here's the thing I'm struggling with - a lot of people use their kids as a reason to quit an addiction. Well, my kids are the reason I have this one. One never sleeps. The other never stops clinging to me. They whine and scream and cry all damn day (even when I plan all the activities, make their favorite foods, etc.). I usually want to scream and throw things by 8am. 

Distract is a HUGE challenge from me. I can't just take a break and run or meditate because they follow me around like they might die if they aren't touching me. I get zero time to meditate, exercise, or have hobbies. They wake up at 4:30am (when I was with my ex he would get up with them so I could work out at 5am, but we're now separated) and don't go to bed until 8pm, and I usually pass out with my 5yo because I must lay with him to fall asleep. I also work a full time job. 

So I guess I'm looking for some creative ideas to help me through those tough moments with my kids, instead of a 30 second trip to the garage to hit the bong. 

Put yourself in this situation: you're tired but you've had too much coffee and you're shaking, and you're hangry. It's 8am on a Saturday and you got two hours sleep. You made bacon and pancakes but no one ate them and they now want granola bars. Since 4:30am tiny humans have screamed, cried, and begged for TV and junk food. They have been fighting for an hour over who gets to sit on your lap. One watched you poop while begging for a show. You keep stepping on small toys and it hurts. Your house is an embarrassing disaster so you clean one corner, and a 2yo immediately dumps out a bucket of toys into said corner. Someone spilled milk on the floor and that same someone is now bleeding so you deal with that and forget about the milk, which you slip in 10 minutes later. It's ONLY 8am, and you have 12 hours of this ahead of you. I have a bad habit of yelling when I'm angry, and I hate yelling at my kids, obviously. I've started telling myself I'm just not cut out for parenting young children, but it's not like I can return them soooooo. (I'm kidding, I love the monsters and would die if I didn't have them. But damn do they make me insane!)

Does anyone have any techniques I can use in these moments? WWYD if you were me? Because it's just so easy to hit that bong, come back a new woman and engage in some legos while giving zero fucks about the mess.

i'd like to give a little more context but for those uninterested in the details of my life (dw i understand) just skip this paragraph :). So i started smoking when i was 14 because i was curious when some of my older friends told me how it felt to be high, i started searching on the internet and found it simply amazing that humans could have a whole different perception and relation to reality (that was the view then) by simply ingesting a plant that'd increase activity in your brain and interact with your brain's chemistry. At first it was just SO fun and high school is easy so i could get away with getting high with my friends at pretty much every lunch break and come in high and simply laugh at the back of the class. Then i moved back to morocco (I was in the US before) and linked up with one of my childhood friends, he introduced me to his friends and they all smoked hash as it's the main thing available. Then i became addicted to tobacco and cannabis, the issue is i smoked in average i'd say      4-6joints a day in the beginning and up to 8-12 joints a day at the peak and long story short it fucked up my lungs and i feel terrible, for those who don't know how horrible a lot of hash combined with a lot of tobacco is well its simply destroy your body, even quicker than with cigarettes alone. This went on and i kept getting away with it last year in uni but i realized i wanted to do something else and dropped my classes in February of 2020, right before the rona in the hopes i'd get accepted to some of the other schools i had applied for next year. Corona happened and the only school that accepted me was in a small town since they were the only ones still providing the necessary manual training required but now im in small town with nothing to do, no friends, in terrible health if i catch the corona my lung are not gonna hold up and i need to stop smoking or i'll absolutely derail my life. 

Pls help :) What do you think i should do? i'm prepared to go cold turkey but dont know if im capable, any advice and/or encouragement are appreciated

This is my first post to reddit, but I wanted to share my story with anyone who would be interested in reading it. I just turned 22, and have been smoking weed since I was 18 my freshman year of college. For a long time I never saw the appeal of smoking, and even dated a weed dealer for a long time who was constantly smoking alone and with friends, where I‚Äôd always just pass on joining. 

Once I smoked for the first time, it was a lot of fun and I slowly started doing it more and more often. It got to a point finally about a year or so ago where I started ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù (as I thought of it at the time) in carts for times I couldn‚Äôt get my hands on actual weed. In my state, it is very illegal still so carts are mostly questionable but by that point I didn‚Äôt care. I had always sworn I wouldn‚Äôt start depending on carts, but quickly got to a point where I was high constantly, after the thirty minute high wore down I would be blowing down on the cart once again. It was awful. I finally got to a point where I couldn‚Äôt eat unless I was high and even then I had to get high enough to get food down. When I realized what was going on, I was terrified. I had terrible emetophobia at the time (fear of throwing up) and when I would try to eat I would get so nauseous I would start having panic attacks thinking I might get sick. I convinced myself I was fine with just smoking every day for the rest of my life because I felt like I couldn‚Äôt face the 2-3 weeks it usually takes people to get back to normal after quitting. 

That all changed when I found out I was pregnant. At the time, I was terrified of stopping smoking because I knew what that meant, but I also knew I wanted to have a healthy pregnancy and set my child up for success. My husband and I both agreed that it wasn‚Äôt worth a potential risk to our child, so I threw my pens away and gave the rest of my weed to my brother. 

Its been a little over 3 months now, and it has been terrible. Morning sickness mixed with weed withdrawals was so hard to get through, I still can‚Äôt think about how sick I was without getting queasy. I wanted to make this post, though, to say that while hard, it is still possible. I struggled with emetophobia for a long time until my pregnancy started making me throw up often enough that I stopped panicking at the thought of it and have been able to get a hold on my anxiety again, finally. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt live without weed with an anxiety/panic disorder. But here I am! 15 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby girl, moving away with my husband and starting a new life! 

I cant lie, I do still get a pang of jealousy when I see my friends smoking and I do miss getting high, but Im so so SO grateful I‚Äôm not stuck in that mindset where I felt trapped by weed anymore. I feel free! It is totally worth those first few rough weeks and it does get easier over time.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49961334}"

I haven't posted on here in awhile because I'm so focused on life. Im not going to go over all my progress just the recent stuff but ill gladly answer any questions about my whole journey to this point below.

Overall my confidence is better than its ever been since I stopped. I learned to control and face my anxieties more than I ever could. My social anxiety still needs a lot of work however but I am working on it, atleast trying too. 

I LOVE not thinking about weed 24/7. I literally have no cravings or urges to go back. Been offered it by friends and even had friends smoking infront of me. They would offer out of courtesy, none of them had try to force me I just say no and they dont ask again, but I still have literally no urges to smoke. I dont really like being around people who are high tho, I find it difficult to talk to them. 

Being able to sleep and feel naturally tired and not just weed tired is GREAT. Dreaming again regularly and waking up refreshed from a good nights sleep is better than any high. 

I started a new job on Monday, Electricians Helper. Hoping to learn the trade and begin a new career. I'm really enjoying it so far, just a lot of learn :) Was great to NOT stress about a drug test. Not having the anxiety about either failing or getting caught faking it was such a great feeling.

Reading posts on here give me motivation to quit, so I'd love to hear your personal experiences about quitting and what benefits its brought you.

Hi i have smoked weed daily for 8 years. I have only quit for like 3-4 months the entire 8 years.   


Around 2-3 years into smoking I got tinnitus, the reason is (I think), is because I am also allegic to pollen (yeah i played a dangerous game), so my nosale already started to get infected with nasal mucus , which have most likely blocked and maybe ruined my ears.  


In the 8 years I smoked I had running nose like 24/7 for 5 years, like crazy infected. This has been my biggest issue.  


Now I have not smoked for almost two months, my nose is still infected but only like 30% as before, so it's going the right direction..  


I hope when all this is over maybe my tinnitus will disappear but most likely no :/  


It's actually worse now than before maybe because the ears are not like stopped and i can hear again lol..

And I believe that I would not have had the self-awareness to quit if it weren't for this subreddit. Thank you all.

I would tell myself wicked awful stories about myself, how incapable and dull I was. How I didn't deserve the life I wanted, or the friends I needed. The truth is, I was stuck and I was stuck because of weed.

I‚Äôm bad at video games and find them frustrating, I get bored during tv or movies, I get bored reading books, I get bored or sometimes anxious listening to podcasts, drawing or painting makes me frustrated and sad, playing music makes me frustrated and sad and embarrassed/anxious about if my neighbors can hear me, I don‚Äôt like exercising because I find the physical sensations of sweat and increased heart rate very uncomfortable and I hate people seeing me exercise and my apartment is very small and I know it generally bothers downstairs neighbors when upstairs people jump around too much, I don‚Äôt like cleaning because I get overwhelmed, I don‚Äôt like cooking because I don‚Äôt have the energy to stand up for as long as it takes to cook.   
   
The only things I like are talking to my friends, which I can‚Äôt do every night cause they have things to do, and scrolling on my phone (Reddit, phone games, sometimes YouTube) but honestly even my phone bores me after several hours.  
  
Just another bit of context: I do have depression, I am on meds, and I have had therapy. The meds and therapy are why I haven‚Äôt been suicidal in years and am able to maintain healthy relationships now. They‚Äôve increased my dosage every couple years whenever those symptoms start to creep back up.  
  
Should I just keep trying to do the things I described above, even though I don‚Äôt really enjoy them? I can‚Äôt think of anything at all outside what I listed....

The problem has gotten much worse in the last 4-5 months (I can't remember exactly when, which is a big problem lately). It used to be only after work, and with friends on my days off. Eventually, it became before and after work, and stoned from 7AM-sleep on every day off.

I've taken two week-long tolerance breaks in that year and a half period. and that's how I discovered r/leaves. I had to come to terms with the fact that the physical withdrawl is real. During my breaks I had no appetite, couldn't sleep for more than 3 hours at time, and my heart just wouldn't stop pounding. By the end of my first break, I knew I was gonna have to quit eventually.

I'm on day 6 now, and guys I am fucking worried. My short term AND long term memory are so much worse than I thought. I'll put something down, then wonder where the hell i put it later. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when certain things happened even 2 days ago. My thoughts seem incoherent at times. 

I just ran 0.75 miles, and when I came back inside, my breathing became strange. When I inhale and exhale, there is a very faint noise, and my lungs feel like they're vibrating. Its been happening for about 2 hours now. (This may be unrelated to weed, but still concerning as hell)

I understand the anxiety, lack of appetite, and restlessness. These are common symptoms. But WORSE memory when quitting and this strange lung thing? Will I ever return to normal?

Its been almost a year now, and im ready to quit, after realizing that the last 4 months have been filled to the brim with as much thc as i could afford. 

But im in a predicament, and i need some advice to get through this. I cant find any helpful info online, so who better to ask than other people in my position, right? 

I tried to quit 2 weeks ago, and almost immediately started seeing problems. The insomnia and lack of appetite were expected, i can handle those, however, i believe i have GERD (self diagnosis, was a problem before i started smoking) which causes me to throw up a ton of bile and or stomach acid every once in a while. The first time i tried to quit, my GERD acted up severely, causing me to vomit up massive amounts of stomach acid multiple times a day. Due to a serious fear of kidney failure from dehydration, i relapsed on the third day, because the weed suppresses my body's production of stomach acid (i stopped puking, was able to hold in liquid and my urine color went back to normal after 2 days). Im too poor to go to a hospital or seek rehab, it was cheaper to just buy my poison and put up with it while i make a game plan. Well today i ran out of weed again, and im ready again to put it down for good. Im terrified that the side effects i experienced last time will cause me to relapse again. I really do want to quit, and i know that there's no place for ""buts"" when you have a goal. That said, if anyone has advice that can help me through the first week or two, it would be GREATLY appreciated.

I love you all, and i cant wait to start this journey with you. I just need to get over the initial hump.

I spent a month away from my lonely (one bedroom) (depression) (addiction) apartment (which I work from home in) and learned how to live (with someone else, which was a biiiiig help) without the pot. 

Now, I‚Äôm back in my lonely apartment and every day feels like day 1 again. It‚Äôs my third day back home and I‚Äôve been thinking about pot every other second. I don‚Äôt have many work meetings after 11 and my current project requires me to sit heads down and crank some code out. It takes some thinking, but I can‚Äôt help but shake that I‚Äôd rather be doing it high. I‚Äôd rather be doing everything here high.

I didn‚Äôt feel the need to do my work high when I was At Work in the Office.. I had natural breaks (going out for lunch, ping pong) and was motivated to focus on my own time when I had the time. Obviously couldn‚Äôt use when I was at work, but would when I got home. 

Fast forward to pandemic, I‚Äôm completely left to my own devices now. I‚Äôm lonely (usually don‚Äôt see a soul all day, only go outside to go on runs which usually happens daily thank gosh), and I still hate cooking. I‚Äôm bored. I crave weed all the time. I even cry about it. I‚Äôm moving away from this shitty solitary apartment in April but I just don‚Äôt know if I can hold out that long. 

My motivations to quit came from my realization that I had an addiction/dependence, some coaxing from my therapist who reminded me every session that quitting would help me reach my goals of wanting to be confident in myself and my decisions. I‚Äôm also very shameful of my dependence. I‚Äôve been a daily user for a long time (6 years?) and my use skyrocketed when WFH started. 

Weed is the easy way out. But every day sucks so much.. being slightly high while I do my monotonous tasks would just make it feel better. I feel like I‚Äôve made no progress after coming back to this apartment, and I just want to use again to make myself feel ok. I feel bad either way - shameful if I‚Äôm using, bored and aware of how much I hate my current situation (apartment and weed cravings) if I don‚Äôt use.

I haven‚Äôt broke yet, but I‚Äôm so damn close. If I break, I know I‚Äôll go back to my old ways of using all day to make the day go by in a slightly less shitty way. I‚Äôll feel bad about it for sure, cue shame and self hatred. But I feel like I‚Äôm in survival mode and being a little stoned will make me feel ok.

Part of the reason I found it so difficult to quit was because my 'best friend' (also my ONLY friend) was also my dealer. I put that in quotes because over the years I've realized this person was never really TRULY a friend to me. She just wanted a smoke buddy. After one of my breaks, when I started smoking again, she legit told me to my face ""you had me worried I was going to have to choose between the weed and you. Thank God your smoking again."" She's done and said sooo many other things that have shown her true colors but that statement hit me like a slap in the face. Her entire identity is legitametly wrapped up in weed and I DO NOT WANT TO BE THAT.

I havent spoken to her for months. She disappears and comes back whenever she feels like it. So, quitting this time around isn't particularly hard cause she's just....gone. But I worry for that text wanting to hang out. You HAVE to smoke around her. She will tell me that she respects my decision not to smoke, and of course I don't have to smoke when we hang out but she also just makes you feel like shit for not smoking with her in passive aggressive ways. Like I've said, I've tried to quit a million times so I've been through it with her a bunch of times. She also told me a long time ago that she ""doesn't fuck with people who don't smoke weed""

I'm doing fairly well a week into this detox. I'm consistently working out, which is a huge help if I'm being honest. I've smoked so much that I got the point where I'm sick of it. Being high is nice but the amount I smoked just created a pressure in my brain and I got tired of it. I LIKE how clear headed I've been. I DO NOT want to fall back into smoking all day every day. I DONT want to fall back into weed at all!!  And I know quitting weed will also help push this toxic person out of my life and ultimately that will be the best for me. But there's always a voice in my head second guessing everything. I can't paint without weed. I cant enjoy music without weed. I can't enjoy video games that much without weed. But it's all LIES. Lies the addiction to weed is telling me and I just have to be strong. And I guess that's why I'm posting this because I feel like I'm strong in my desire to not smoke but I also feel so incredibly weak about it.

I have been lurking this page for a while now trying to pluck up the motivation to take a significant break after many years of smoking - initially for plenty of other reasons, but more recently to cope with a highly stressful job. For a long time this worked as I naturally find it very difficult to relax and unwind, particularly as I work in a challenging field addressing the impacts and drivers of trauma, and I‚Äôm just a very wired person in general. For a long time this coping mechanism allowed me to detach immediately from work in very marked ways (I.e. being high meant I wasn‚Äôt working anymore). Over time this led to my tolerance being incredibly high, as well as limiting my ability to develop more healthy coping mechanisms to deal with the associated stress and anxiety. In addition, being so task oriented and work focussed meant I would regular skip meals or forget to snack - so smoking was a way to motivate me to eat. I can now see how this ultimately has created issues generally in making excuses for myself to smoke more - giving myself permission not to eat until I was high. While I have been a long time smoker, it has been difficult to discuss these issues as I am read as a very high functioning and productive person that works in the community. I have always been too concerned to discuss these issues due to the stigma attached to cannabis use, as well as not wanting to concern others with a genuine issue I am struggling with. Despite this I am now 8 days free and committed to relearning how to maintain healthy eating patterns and coping mechanisms for stress. I really appreciate the openness everyone in this subreddit brings and cannot thank you all enough.

I have tried twice before to quit cold turkey, and failed both attempts in less than a week. I'm currently on day 15 with no weed and day 36 with no tobacco, with increasing momentum every day. It may not seem like that much, but this is the longest I have gone without smoking in over 4 years. This isn't some golden way to beat the addiction, and I certainly have had a few really bad days so far, but it has personally helped me more than anything else I have tried.

It all started with that sudden, burning epiphany that weed had outweighed any of the positives it once had and became a parasite on my life. This was important, as it gave me the willpower I didn't know I had when it came to controlling my habit, at least on a daily basis. Telling myself, ""Instead of smoking that bong rip now, smoke it in another hour from now."" It helped making smaller amounts last until I went to sleep, which is when I felt I most needed it.

Before quitting, my daily use was about 2 grams a day. Figured this by checking how often I was buying an ounce from my dealer and how many days it would take me to complete it. Usually 13-14 days exactly. Anyway, I read something online where they recommended decreasing by .5 grams every 3-5 days. I found that was a bit too much for me, so my plan was to decrease my amount by .25 every 4-5 days. I liked to call them ""levels"", so 1.75 level, 1 gram level, .75 gram level, and so on. I weighed out my daily allowance on my scale and only smoked that amount for the day. If I had any leftover by the end of the day, I put it back into my jar; nothing carries over. Instead of smoking every single hour, I would try and distract myself to postpone that next hit to make the amount last all day, so I could at least get those few hits right before bed.

Soon, I found I didn't need 4-5 days of smoking each level, as I was feeling confident that I could speed the process up. Spending 3 days, rather than 5 on level 1.25 before lowering to 1 gram level. Spending 2 days on that before lowering further, and all the while I was tracking my schedule on my calendar. It quickly became very exciting to get to that final 0/gram a day level. By the end, I spent 1 day on 0.75 level, 1 day on 0.50 level, and on the final 0.25 day, I smoked my last 2 bowls knowing and telling myself that was it, for good. I was not disillusioned, I knew Mary J had done much good and helped me cope through the most hellish times in my life, but those times were over. Now she overstayed her welcome and my brain was begging me to kick her out. I had to be completely honest with myself, and these extra days leading to quitting gave my mind time to process it all.

The day after my last hit, I gave my best stoner buddy all my joint wraps, rollers, filters, and leftover weed that I didn't finish smoking. Threw my bong in the garbage, which was my best tool and choice of weapon when it came to smoking. I did however clean my pipe and gave that to a different friend. The only memento I kept was my grinder, which I have had since I began smoking over 7 years ago and was a gift from my mom. I did clean it to remove all weed residue, and after put it in my box of memories. Getting rid of anything with actual, smokable THC is a must as I know I could be a fiend and did not want any physical temptation their to lure me.

Taking on this new path was never easy, and I'm not sure when it will get easy. I do know this method helped me a lot with coping and adjusting to life with the herb I had grown to rely on and so mindlessly indulge in.  I needed that extra time to process the very powerful, almost spiritual shift in my life. If you try this method, adjust your time with each level as you feel you need to. It is not an easy decision to give up the plant we all grew to love, so taking your time is definitely an option. For others, cold turkey is the only way, but we will all navigate and get to the light at the end of the tunnel somehow. We got this, and I feel very optimistic for the future, and hope others can feel the same.

The backstory this time.,"I got diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis when I was 28. I was given a membership to a cannabis society for medicinal weed to help with the pain and inflammation, and it was like being a kid in a candy shop because at the time, marijuana was not legal and it was tough to obtain without a dealer. Of course, I did it for fun more than medicinal reasons because I'd used weed occasionally in my teens and early 20s, and I'd quite enjoyed it then, too. In the beginning, a gram would last me more than a week. These days, it takes a gram just to get high. 

So anyway, I've made numerous efforts to quit over the last year especially, and each one of those quits got turned into a tolerance break, just so I could justify taking it up again. It was usually a three day break at the most. And I think because I would just smoke the black shit in my pipes instead of weed, I didn't really take those breaks after all.

I decided that I had to quit. Weed to me is like cigarettes, I can never have it again unless I'm willing and prepared to take it on full time again. I'm not.

The last two weeks were BAD! I can see why so many people go back after so many days. I was nauseated, anxious, drained of energy, fatigued, and chilled. Then I would be the opposite: drenching hot, full of energy, relaxed, and sometimes I felt like I could actually eat something besides carbs (but I couldn't). The dreams have been pretty cool, though. 

Yesterday morning, I was gagging in the bathroom as my body fought to expel nasty black phlegm from itself. It was gross and disgusting, and was the same colour as the crap in my pipes that I used to smoke. I know that too will come to an end, but it'll probably happen again in the morning.

Anyways, as I type this, it is the early morning hours of day 14. I know the withdrawal isn't done yet, but at least I can eat again, finally. I had my first real dinner about 7 hours ago and didn't want to hurl after. I even ate it all, and had chocolate bark for dessert. Win!

To anyone who is not feeling good because they're newly quit, it WILL pass! Treat yourself as if you have the flu, get lots of rest, drink lots of liquids, maybe find a buddy (both of mine seemed to have disappeared--if they gave in, I hope they find the strength to try again when they're ready), and keep reminding yourself that it will pass. 

Take as many times as you need to to quit, but remember that if you start again while you're feeling like crap, you'll have to go through it all over again when you quit the next time. Just throwing that out there. Be good to yourselves.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4051137}"

The mountains are one of my passions. One of many reasons I knew I had to quit was because I wasn‚Äôt enjoying ski touring (or anything) like I know I should while I‚Äôm chronic (and I am powerless over my use, as many of you can probably relate to). I planned to go touring Saturday but I bailed last minute because I couldn‚Äôt drag myself out of bed. On one hand I didn‚Äôt feel mentally or physically capable, but on the other I know how important that kind of stuff is to my well-being.

I‚Äôve lost close to 10 pounds over the past week. 10lbs that I didn‚Äôt really have to loose. I was so stressed before I quit (mostly about quitting, but also about issues I hadn‚Äôt properly addressed) that I hadn‚Äôt been eating well for a few days prior to day 1. My relationship with food has always been a bit of a struggle, but when I‚Äôm doing well it isn‚Äôt as much of an issue.

Planned an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù day today. Roughly 7.5km and 650m elevation gain with minimal avalanche terrain exposure. Those numbers are almost a joke for me, or anyone who even semi-regularly tours. Literally should have been my easiest day of the season. It was the hardest day I have ever had in the back-country, at least physically. I was dry heaving on the way up, severe dehydration cramps and muscle aches and every step after about 4km felt like I was going to collapse. The only reason I didn‚Äôt turn around was because my boyfriend had wanted to do this objective for a while and I wasn‚Äôt really interested in repeating it. Oh, and because I knew I‚Äôd be beyond pissed at myself if I quit.

I was planning on bringing what was left of my stash with me and dumping it up there. Fortunately I forgot it because when I got to the top I was in so much pain all I could think is ‚Äúa joint would solve this‚Äù. I genuinely didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be able to get myself off that mountain, despite the fact that riding down is the fun part!

Well, obviously I‚Äôm back in reception. I did it-without having to call search and rescue. It hurt. Realistically it was probably too much for where I am right now physically and mentally. But maybe not, maybe it was just my limit and proving to myself that I am stronger than my weakness. Despite all that hard work and feeling SO hungry I had to force myself to eat 4 perogies for supper. But I drank lots of water today, exercised, got some sun, fresh air, and communicated effectively with my boyfriend. It was beyond uncomfortable, it was straight up painful. But I guess that‚Äôs what personal growth feels like sometimes.

The last day out touring I had before quitting weed should have been incredible, I had amazing company, we were in a stunning area and the skiing was pretty great too; and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. It might sound like I‚Äôm complaining about today, but for the most part, I had fun. Ok, maybe FUN isn‚Äôt the right word, but I felt real emotions. Some of those emotions weren‚Äôt ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúfun‚Äù but they were real and I felt them and dealt with them without smoking green. It‚Äôs frustrating knowing that until I start eating right again and get my strength back up I am limited to stuff that I normally would consider kind of tedious/boring. But it‚Äôs so amazing knowing that even though I‚Äôm not doing as well as I‚Äôd like to be, I‚Äôm doing what I need to to change that.

I used to think it helped me relax, but it really just made me complacent with my life. It started out as a nightly ritual after my daughter went to bed an then turned into a smoke as soon as I got off work, an 3-4 times on my days off. I started needing it to calm myself down during stressful situations. Smoking a little bowl was the first thing I would do before coming into the house after work. After a while I started questioning myself, wondering why I was smoking every day. I still got shit done, but I didn‚Äôt like experiencing the brain fog, the constant daydreaming and being stuck in my own head. The munchies an never feeling full an waking up with a stomach ache. Feeling groggy in the morning when I was convinced herb helped me sleep. I have been 9 days clean today and I can confidently say I prefer sober me over high me. I‚Äôm exercising, I‚Äôm finding time to do yoga, an read books. I‚Äôm clear headed, I breathe better. I feel more confident. I wake up with energy in the morning. I have dreams! But most importantly, I don‚Äôt feel the need to get high to enjoy a meal, or relax any longer. If you keep doing the same things, your going to get the same results. Challenge yourself, write in your journal how much better you feel off the drug, and although it is hard, stick to it. There‚Äôs a reason we wanted to quit in the first place. For a year I have tried to quit and I really feel this time it‚Äôs going to stick. I couldn‚Äôt of done it without this amazing group. An I know I‚Äôm not out of the woods yet, there will be days I‚Äôll get the itch to smoke, or I‚Äôll think to myself that one night wouldn‚Äôt hurt. But I‚Äôm smart enough now to realize that is a lie, an it would quickly turn into a habit again. If your thinking about quitting now is the time!

I'm 29 and have been a moderate daily user for almost 9 years and it seemed an insurmountable task to get through the day without it. I quit cold turkey 8 days ago... And was unexpectedly let go from my job the next day. I was so tempted to relapse, but this page has been my rock. I also downloaded the Grounded app as a daily reminder to stay strong. The first few days were REALLY tough, but I'm finally feeling better now.

I just had my first job interview in 5 years and it felt so good to be so clear-headed. I was worried the stress from it would lead me to make bad decisions; thanks to my family and all of your stories, however, I haven't been tempted even once today. Again, THANK YOU!

It would be great to land this job, but I'm proud of myself regardless and feeling more optimistic than I have in years.

Tolerance/Quit-attempts are easily in the double digits by now, but this time I won't go it alone...

Storytime: I smoked my first joint 10 years ago in a rebellious defiance of good-old Catholic upbringing. I immediately found a part of life that I severely lacked growing up, and a love-bond was instantly created. My first bong followed shortly after that, and progressively got more and more frequent until I reached my current stage: multiple sesh's a day, multiple cones per sesh; roughly an ounce a fortnight.

Here's the kicker though: I'm a 27yo who has yet to move out of home; still living with a heavily anti-weed family. As a result, every sesh I've had for the last decade has been covert. For 90% of my blazes I would drive to a selection of nearby carparks and lurk around for hours on end, listening to podcasts/watching YouTube, smoking countless cones, and knowingly raising and lowering the stress/anxiety gauge anytime another car entered the carpark.

In this metal cocoon, safe and secure from new (read: dangerous) experiences, I've receded from ten years of living my life.. and have been painfully aware of the fact for too long to recall. Many of my friends are married, have kids, proper jobs and properties; and most importantly they have a handle on their work/recreation balance. I have a wildly skewed recreation modality, and have shaved my discipline away each time I bought more weed during a Q-attempt.

I've just graduated from university. I remembered recently that I begun my higher education vowing to stop smoking so I could focus more and fully embrace the student life (extra-curricular activities, socialising). So at minimum, I have been on this train of thought for 4 years, and only once in that time did I exceed 2 weeks of sobriety: I spent 3 months in Japan and was fully aware of the temptations upon returning... I was incredibly proud of the sobriety (minus booze and cigarettes, which somewhat substituted the weed, albeit less intensively). I was so proud of myself, in fact, that I reasoned a new level of discipline once I returned, and instantly weeded out weed-supplies when I was home. I lasted less than an hour once availability was there again.

If anyone is still reading, thank you for the interest... I have always been hesitant posting or even communicating my problem (nobody else knows the extent of my smoking habits, friends know very little, family knows nothing at all), but this subreddit has shown me time and time again that not only is A) Glorious sobriety absolutely possible; but also B) There are people out there who genuinely (and uniquely) understand the situation I'm in/have been in for a decade. I'll do my best to update my experience, fill the voids with good habits, and log the process on the app Grounded.

Final thought: As a fan of the mange/anime One Piece, I strongly believe in following one's dreams and using the support of Nakama (crew/friends/allies) to stand taller than whats possible alone. This is why I love /r/leaves especially. You're all my Nakama now <3",7,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.48826584}"

Today's entry read **""If you made it this far stoned \[lowlevelscumbagetech\] is really fucking proud of you""** 

It's been a long time since I have felt proud of my willpower. Not sure I've ever been proud of my willpower tbh. 

I'll be frank this sub is great for the inspiration and the big thoughts but my primary reason for stopping was money,  I cant rationally burn ¬£300 a month while being this in-debt and I saw this as something that would be horrible. I only really started a decade ago because of terrible insomnia and anxiety. I thought for sure I would be a sleepless shaking mess and yeah let's face it I was for 4-days minimum and I still can't sleep for shit. 

But in a weird way, I'm quite surprised that it's been this easy. Whatever brain chemistry was happening in my 17-year-old head isn't the same now and the only thing that had been connecting me to it was being high. A low-level vibration in my stomach of always be vigilant, always be scared. That's not there anymore. I feel like an idiot for clinging onto it for so long by getting high. I firmly believe there is a strong medicinal quality to weed that will help a lot of people with their demons giving them chase. But it was basically my only link to my very unhappy teenage years.  

I think what I'm trying to say in a very muddled up way is-  If you are scared to try quitting because you didn't start smoking for fun or with friends, you started to try and treat a problem you had. At least try and see where you are at now without it. 

Youll have a different relationship with it to the casual smokers, it'll feel safe and like the only thing that ever helped but ultimately If one week/one month/one year down the line you are thinking *""well fuck I feel much worse than I ever did stoned""* it's not like weed is gone forever, and you can make a clear-headed informed decision on how much it did or didn't help you.   

No one should ever judge you for taking a drug which helps you. But give yourself a chance to be sure it is.

I have not been feeling the things I felt during previous quits, like irritability, anger, headaches, GI issues, depression, etc. 

So far my only problem has been sleeping, but I'm trying to manage that with 5mg melatonin before bedtime, and no caffeine after noon. I used to drink lots of coffee all day long, to keep me from crashing due to multiple daily weed sessions. Now a cup or two of tea in the morning is enough. Eventually I want to cut out caffeine altogether, but first I'll get more weed-free days behind me.

I want to point out 1 little (but meaningful) benefit from quitting. Because my addiction is a complete secret from my family, previously I would have to go out several times a day ""for a walk"" to get high. Today is a rainy windy day, and I would have been outside under an umbrella struggling to light up. But now that I've quit, I can stay comfortably inside with my family. Wonderful!

After dozens of failed quit attempts, this one feels different. I've abandoned any pretense of moderating or of thinking that I can use weed responsibly.

Quick background - I'm 44(m), father (7yo), husband and exec at a tech company.¬†(created this account so I could share freely)

I've been smoking a lot for the past 7 years (right after I became a parent), and smoking too much (7-8 hours a day, everyday) since COVID started.¬†

Let me just say this out right - I absolutely love getting high. I've loved it since the first time I tried it back in 2001. Before I discovered vape pens, things were totally manageable, once/twice a week and all above board. But after I discovered odorless vape pens, my habit just took over. I've been insisting that I can manage it for the past few years but last 3 years or so, I've been kidding myself.¬†

Now, it takes a lot of smoking to get high (I'm up to 4, 1g cartridges a month!), and I'm hiding it from my wife, and basically sacrificing anything and everything that I can get away with, to find time to get high.¬†(not to mention how much money I've smoked away)

I have the job I've always wanted and I absolutely love my family - but I'm sacrificing all of that to get high and the cost to me and those around me is not worth it any more. I decided it was time about 3 months ago. But it has taken that long to have my first full 36 hrs of sobriety. And that's the journey I want to share, with the goal of maybe helping someone else.

Here are the things that caught me by surprise and led to me either ""delaying"" quitting or deciding that I would keep getting high. Rather than resist these, when I embraced them as part of the process I was able to move forward.

1. **Physical symptoms of withdrawal** \- the intensity of these symptoms caught me off-guard and made it very hard for me to stay off weed till I mentally accepted that this was going to happen and found solutions for the different symptoms. Stomach felt really weird (almost like strong cramps), headaches through the day, lack of energy, irritation, and just general malaise - all this showed up every time I decided today was the day. ***These things didn't happen on days where I just didn't have a chance to smoke but happened consistently on days that I had decided I was going to quit!*** That told me without any doubt that this was the inner addict fighting to survive. This is what your addict brain does, it creates physical discomfort and makes you think getting high is the only solution. What helped me the most was realizing that this was temporary and above all - this was caused because of the weed! Weed was not the solution to this, but it was literally the reason. That realization gave me a lot of strength to deal with this. Know this - these get better really quick. In a few days they become manageable and you can navigate them with things like hot showers, nice herbal teas, healthy food, walks, exercise and sleep. All things that are actually good for you.
2. **Sleep** \- this should not be a surprise to anyone but man, sleep without getting high is hard in the beginning. I've been falling asleep high for the past 4 years, and usually fall asleep before I've even hit the pillow. So 'falling asleep' was not a process I needed. Yesterday was the first night I slept completely sober in 4 yrs and I struggled a lot. In the past after staying in bed for a couple of hours I would just getup, smoke and go back to sleep. But then I would be right back where I started. Last night, I asked myself, do I really want to quit or not. And if the answer is yes, then I should just deal with it. And ***this morning, I've woken up more clear headed than I've felt in a very long time (even though I don't think I got good sleep last night)***. Here's my insight for you on this - make a plan to help you fall asleep - podcasts, audiobooks, meditation, etc - whatever helps you relax, make a plan so when you are struggling you are not also having to solve the problem in the moment. Having some options beforehand, will help you get through it. This also gets significantly better in a short-time.
3. **Time** \- this one totally got me. I suddenly have a lot more time. Or better said - I am aware a lot more of my time. My normal pattern was to get high right after my work day was done. Last zoom meeting is over, get high, feel good, go down and join the family. As a result, I didn't really give a crap about what we did the rest of the day. I was high and was happy. So one by one, all my hobbies fell out of my routine - music, reading, sports, time with my wife, my relationships with friends / family, all took a total backseat (or disappeared) because once I was high I didn't ""feel"" like doing anything. It completely took my motivation to do even the smallest things. I read this yesterday on r/leaves and it is 100% true - ***""Weed doesn't kill you, but it kills who you could become""*** \- This is exactly what it does. Takes over your motivation center and then keeps you happy doing nothing. The high is a time-warp and you don't realize how much time you spend there and how much time you waste doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. We've all read how time is the most precious resource we have in our lives and weed will make you spend that like you have it growing on trees. If your future is important to you, and you want to take control of your future, then you need control of how you spend your time. And weed will take that from you. Think about this, realize this and then you can deal with it. Have some activities that you can do when this time suddenly shows up in your day again - make a list of people that you can reconnect with - my sponsor said this to me - ***Connection beats addiction every time*** \- so go build your connections again. It will help you find yourself and remember who you were.More important it will remind you why you should be spending your time on this rather than staying high. In the beginning this 'extra' time feels like a burden. This is the time you would normally get high so your addict will call for it again, but look at it as a gift and an opportunity. Try to do some of things that make your happy and slowly this time will become yours again and the addict will take a backseat.
4. **Emotions / Feelings** \- this is the final and most important insight. ***Get ready to face the real you***.Weed is what I call the ""avoid button"". It masks itself as the ""easy"" button but in reality you don't actually deal with anything when you are high so you are just avoiding it. In most cases it is not getting pushed down the road either. It is still right there we just don't do anything about it because we are enjoying our high. I've been noticing in the last couple of weeks when I've been going to meetings and getting serious about this, when during the day the urge/craving showed up.I found two very consistent patterns - a. time of day - my typical time of day to smoke is when I need to be ready for the cravings and have something else to keep me distracted (this is predictable and can be planned), b. Discomfort - this was the surprise for me. Every time something even slightly uncomfortable happened, I just wanted to get high to ""deal"" with it. I started noticing that if my wife said something snappy, work got hard, felt weird, movie got tense, I was stressed about something being due, literally any type of discomfort and my body was looking for weed to help me cope.For all of us that are marijuana addicts, weed helps us get through the day but it doesn't actually help you process or deal with anything. It just helps you mask time and jump you to the next morning with 100s of YouTube videos and bad tv shows and movies. Your feelings / emotions stay right where they are and take root and get stronger and bigger. This is the hardest part of recovery and why most fall off the wagon so often. \*\*\*Weed makes us stop dealing with the discomfort of life, and there can be no life without discomfort.\*\*\*This is where you need help and support. r/leaves has been a gift for me and so has MA-online. I started going to meetings last month and listening to other's struggles gave me a lot of clarity and hope. And hearing their success gave me huge motivation and inspiration but it doesn't change how hard this part is. You need to find your support system to get through this but if you take this part lightly, your recovery will be at risk.Realize that the addict is part of you. And accept all of you and have curiosity and compassion for who you are. Learning who you are and why you are will make you whole and make you a better person. I don't know how long this takes but I can already feel that I've been denying myself too many things because I liked getting high so much. Each moment of discomfort is an opportunity for reflection and self-learning. It is hard. It sucks. But it is worth it.

If you are still reading this, I hope this has helped. I am still in hour 34 of my sobriety and I have a very long way to go. But these four things above prevented me from getting started all this time. I hope my learning can help you get there as well.

Here are the things that will help you the most -

* Patience - this takes time, think about how long you've been getting high
* Compassion - you are making a lot of changes and the addict is part of you
* Support - you need to have a support system that you can rely on because this is hard
* Acceptance - you need to accept all parts of you and the entire process, there are no shortcuts

Best of luck. I hope you can find your way as well. Reach out if you want to discuss anything.

tl;dr - took me 3 months to get started with my sobriety, wanted to share why it was so hard, realized that there are some things that are just part of the process and it helped me find success so wanted to share. The 4 things that held me back - withdrawal symptoms, lack of sleep without smoking, finding too much time on my hands and experiencing all the feelings I've been avoiding.

We can do hard things.,"With Saturday being my husband's birthday and Sunday being Valentine's day, we were childless on Saturday evening/night. It was the perfect excuse to give into weakness and hold off on quitting. And while I did take only 8 GB's, as opposed to my usual 20+, it still wasn't a day 1. 

My last smoking session was around 10pm. I played some of my favorite songs, made a little ceremony of it (because although it was a love/hate relationship, it still encompassed significant years), and said goodbye to this stage of life. I wanted to ""see it off,"" for it to feel final. 

It's Monday now and my strength has returned. I feel convicted, capable, and ready to move on from this addiction. I told my husband he's not allow to let me give in again, and he'll hold true to that. I put all my smoking stuff (GB caps, bowls, every single lighter I could find.) in a safe and I gave him the key. Everything will be moved out to the garage and he agreed to only smoke when I'm occupied or asleep. Otherwise it's locked away when he's at work. 

Almost 14 hours in. I got this. I am stronger than weed. I believe in myself. I have faith in myself. I trust that I will see this though. I gave birth unmedicated 3 times.

I have several mantras I rely on to remind myself why this choice is important. The most important is this: 
**The benefits of not worrying about getting high outweigh all of the short term pleasures. Just being free from the stress of dependency is a reward in itself, forget all of the other mental and physical benefits. **

Even though I had the whole week to prepare, I barely prepared. Spend most of my time avoiding the work and wasting my time on: Netflix, Reddit, Call Of Duty, YouTube and so much other BS. 



It was a job interview for my dream job and I ruined it. I ruined it completely. I was nervous, talking fast, not talking clearly, didn't ask good questions and so on. 
I used the failed job interview as an excuse to get high & drunk again. 



I'll hear today if I got the job or not, but the probability for that is low. There were 8 candidates in total for 2 positions. So it's not really likely that I'll get the job. 



I was clean for a week. No alcohol, no weed or other drugs. Even though I was clean, I didn't do anything worthwhile with my time. Wasted it completely. 




I feel like I'm sinking each day, each month, each year. Last month was better than this month. 6 months ago, life was crap but better than now. 1 year ago life was stil crap, but better than now. 3 years ago life was also crap, but way better than now. 




Life continues to get worse and worse and worse. I'm sinking everyday and getting closer to the bottom. The bottom is when I'm dead, in jail or in a mental institution. Because that's the path that I'm on. 



Quitting weed and booze will slow down my sinking proces for sure, but it won't reverse it. If I want to ""get back to the surface"" then I'll have to swim. Swimming means doing the things that I have to do, even when I don't feel like it or don't want to. 





I realized that abstention is NOT recovery. 
Yes, being clean is a good thing. But if I spend my whole day on reddit, Netflix, and call of duty then my life won't get any better.¬† 




Step 1 is abstention. But that's not enough. It's not enough by a mile. Step 2 is recovery: Working hard everyday and doing what must be done: Eating healthy, making a budget, limit my time online, find a new job, save money and so on and so on. That's the only way my life can change. I have to actively work at it and make my life better. If I don't then it will only get worse and worse and worse. 




Life won't get any better unless I work for it. Nobody is going to do the work for me. Nobody is going to payoff my debts. Nobody will eat healthy for me. Nobody is coming to save me. 




I have to be smart, focused and goal oriented. Otherwise life will be worse six months from now. 



Everyday I have two choices: Sink or Swim. 



I've been sinking now for the past 8 years. It's a long way back, but I'm ready. If don't swim then I'll sink further. I can't have it both ways. I can't expect my life to get better while spending all my time being high, on Netflix, call of duty etc

I started smoking weed during my first relationship, when things were looking bad and I could not cope with the emotions. When she left me I smoked away all my emotions because numb was the only thing I was okay with feeling. This habit of smoking to feel numb lasted for 5 years after she left. In that time I quit more times than I can count, I tried therapy and a 12 step program and nothing worked. I kept coming back to the drug that let me feel numb. 

I really could not understand why I was dependent on this drug. I am an intelligent person with fairly well-off parents and all of the opportunities life could provide for me. Yet my whole life I felt there was a hole inside me that needed to be filled. I filled it with weed for most my adult life. 

So, what changed for me? I got into dabs and my tolerance got too high so when I switched back to flower I was feeling my emotions again. After an emotional outburst I was recommended the book Running on Empty by Dr. Jonice Webb. This book changed my entire outlook on life. Dr. Webb starts by giving an example of how an emotionally healthy parent would react to a situation that would create an emotionally healthy adult. Then she goes through all the ways parents can be unhealthy and how they would respond to the same situation and the message it sends the kid. This was the first mental health book that truly made me feel that what happened when I was a kid was not okay and not my fault, and I have carried the damage since. 

Every other time I have tried to quit I only addressed the behavior of a stoner. I was not addressing the emotional needs I had that had been ignored my entire life. I read this book while still smoking and I have since quit. I haven't looked back because this is the first time I have tried to quit smoking by utilizing my emotions. 

So those of you who, like me, keep trying to quit but nothing you do ever sticks, what are you doing to address your emotional needs?",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.57950413}"

Then another J, and a 3rd, then I was back at it. I thought I'd be fine because I was smoking around a 1/4 of what I used to daily. Fast forward to a week ago I realized I needed to quit again. I thought quitting would be easy since I smoked so little for only 40ish days. Yeah no. I feel so sick.

If you're thinking about smoking again and breaking a sober streak, don't do it! I was hoping I'd smoke that joint and be reminded why I quit. Nope. It was fantastic being high again. For the first 3-4 days, for the first week, etc. Then it slowly became a crutch again. Being high was less and less fun each day. I found myself disliking being high because I wasn't functional enough to even play video games like I can sober.

I thought if I smoked less I could quit easier with less withdrawals. And while withdrawals this time pale in comparison to quitting after smoking for 5+ years straight, I hate feeling this horrible.

&#x200B;

Lesson learned. I can't smoke at all. I don't even want to smoke occasionally with friends. I want to never smoke again now.

I careened across the world, until I reached the edge. Some others were there, just milling about. I asked some others what was beyond, they said to have a look for myself. I crept to the edge and knowing I could boost-jump back, I let myself glide and fall beyond the rim. The world was like a flat disc, and underneath it was a mass of colors and swirling lights, like great pools of shimmering lava of yellows, reds, oranges,...

2021-02-14 16:02:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ljxb0r/thoughts_and_observations_from_a_chronic_user/,Thoughts and Observations from a Chronic User,"  

Hi everyone, long time lurker first-time poster. I wanted to share some thoughts and observations from my small leaving experience. I quit cold turkey with my partner last Sunday on the 7th, so I am only beginning my journey but I‚Äôm very excited about making the decision to leave my lifestyle of pot use and substance abuse in general. 

For some background, I‚Äôm in my early thirties and started smoking around 14/15 years old. Regular everyday use didn‚Äôt begin until I was 18. Since then, I‚Äôve smoked daily from morning to night until this past week. I quit once in 2019 when I tried to quit for a job but failed. That‚Äôs almost 15 years nonstop. The weed wasn‚Äôt your grandma‚Äôs pot either, it was top shelf good good. My partner and I smoked an ounce every 2-3 days like it was nothing. It was a badge of honor for us, one of the things that attracted us to each other was that no one could keep up with us. How things can change! 

Weed isn‚Äôt the only drug, I drank and smoked cigs during this time as well. Quit ciggies three years ago on April 10 but the alcohol comes and goes. I dabbled in psychedelics for a few years in my early twenties too. Now I‚Äôm trying to take care of myself before these vices take over. I knew deep, deep in the back of my head that being high constantly wasn‚Äôt normal. Functioning through pretty good jobs and school had me thinking I was a cut above the rest because no one really suspected it unless you smoked or got to know me. 

Whatever the reason is that I quit, my partner, you, or anyone else is neither here nor there. We all have them otherwise we‚Äôd be stoned on the couch not reading this. What \*is\* important is that you have a reason(s). What‚Äôs important is that weed is no longer helping you. You and I know this isn‚Äôt how things should be. We shouldn‚Äôt be navigating through life trying to avoid people, places, jobs to get high and stay high. If weed has negatively shaped your life this post is for you. If you think weed will make things better this is for you.

Change your perspective on weed. I read a lot of posts here and sometimes I see the comments going back and forth from knowing they need to quit but still being in love with the plant. It‚Äôs hard to face the truth about the negative aspects of weed when it‚Äôs been so comforting to us, especially during traumatic periods when we feel it helps us so much. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. It‚Äôs a veil keeping us from dealing with our emotions in a healthy way. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid if I stop or take a break, I won‚Äôt enjoy it anymore.‚Äù I think a lot of chronic users have this thought. Maybe you don‚Äôt even enjoy it right now. It‚Äôs a way to keep ourselves stabilized in this comfortable, numb state where nothing gets worse or better. Change is the only constant in life and we‚Äôre ignoring it for the constant high.  Don‚Äôt romanticize past, present, or future moments with weed. I understand the sense of loss and despair when you face that reality, but it passes. We only limit ourselves from everything the minute we think life will be less than without it. When the idealization with weed ends you can accept it for what it is and what it was.

  That being said, this week has been hell. One big rollercoaster but I don‚Äôt plan on getting off anytime soon. From being in bed cold shivering to out of bed dying from hot flashes and sweat I didn‚Äôt think it would be like this physically! Headaches, stomach pain, indigestion, low hunger, over sensory like I never imagined. But I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm sober and I‚Äôm happier than I‚Äôve ever been. I hope some of my words can help some of you too. 

1. Communication - my gods is that important when you quit. Reach out whether it‚Äôs here or therapy or with friends or family you can trust and know they will listen. Don‚Äôt feel ashamed, we‚Äôre all going through it, and talking about what‚Äôs on your mind is so very important during this time.

2. Cognitive restructuring ‚Äì this is a therapeutic approach to negative patterns our brains succumb to from depression, anxiety, drug abuse, etc. If you don‚Äôt have access to professional help this is a tried-and-true method to reconstructing the way you think.  Positive thinking and reinforcement can change your life, my friends. When we talk to ourselves in negative language and patterns it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. There is tons of info and resources, I cannot recommend this enough.

3. If you feel like dirt, rest. It‚Äôs ok to just lay in bed and sweat if that‚Äôs all you can do. Life doesn‚Äôt stop just because you do but don‚Äôt give up because of this. If you feel good one day, that‚Äôs awesome. Get back into your favorite things. Know your mind and body are healing and going 100% is going to take a minute.

4. Eat frequent small meals. My appetite was piss the first few days but I made sure to eat my favorite foods/snacks as a treat and to keep up my energy.

5. Salt. If you are dumping sweat while you quit and drinking lots of water, make sure you watch your sodium. Weightlifting/working out in the past I knew I needed salt a lot the first few days. I woke on the 2nd morning at 10 am CRAVING salty potato chips. Listen to your body!

6. Progress is not linear. Relapses do not erase progress. This \*is not\* me saying to start smoking a bowl after you get that job/gf/bf, or you feel bad/good/whatever. (Therapeutic relapse) This is me saying that shit happens. Relapses happen. This doesn‚Äôt change the underlying desire to quit. It took me over 10+ times to quit smoking cigs over 10+ years. Yet here I am almost three years nicotine free. Shoutout to r/stopsmoking! Not another puff!

7. It‚Äôs ok to cry. I don‚Äôt know you or your life but it‚Äôs safe to say if you are a chronic user, you‚Äôve suppressed some things. I cried a lot when I quit cigs and weed, sometimes alone, sometimes with loved ones. This is natural and healthy. It‚Äôs quite beautiful too.

It started out as just a bonding activity me and my brother partook in together ( I'm extremely close with my brother and being around him and just smoking together and talking and laughing always helped me battle my depression and anxiety) it started getting more and more constant the more we hung out with our friends to the point where we were smoking together every day and having smoke seshs with friends weekly where we would go through so much weed. I thought nothing of it at the time as I found it so comforting and I could afford it. I eventually moved from home with my girl, she doesn't have a addictive personality like me so she could smoke occasionally and say no when she didn't want to, but that wasn't the case for me. As I had to battle my struggles on my own I started to abuse it heavy everyday. I couldn't live my life without being high every single day. The longest I made it before this was 1 month but the depression lured me back in. I just wanted more from life to the point where a week ago I almost broke down and cried cause I felt like a worthless slave to THC. I just couldn't see myself being able to free myself from it. Im a little worried to tell my brother I quit because I have been so close to him growing up and it became our main bonding activity and I get nervous thinking about telling him.

2021-02-14 14:27:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ljvc0s/straight_dreamin/,Straight Dreamin'!,"Throughout quarentine, I've enjoyed looking at myself more honestly, specifically unhealthy/self-sabbotaging habits. I quit smoking cannabis for about three months over the Summer, and had the most amazing dreams, at times lucid, during that time. I wanted to quit smoking cigarettes, but knew I needed to not drink alcohol if I was going to be successful. Cigarettes were harder to quit for me than cannabis so I started smoking cannabis while quitting tobacco. I have now been 2 months free of tobacco and am giving myself the gift of dreaming for Valentine's Day and quitting cannabis! 

It almost seemed immediate that I stopped remembering my dreams when I started smoking cannabis again. There are other effects, but through this process I've realized how important dreams are to me and humanity in general. I personally think dreams are a part of processing deep seeded shit, and are literally a forgotten part of the human psyche  that aids in maintaining a healthy mental health. I'm starting in a dream group in March as my own support group of sorts for maintaining sobriety and to work towards more lucid dreaming. 

It's been 18 years relying on cannabis, and I am excited to finally get to know my true self!

The most helpful thing I've found in my path to giving up unhealthy habits is to set a date to quit. Not today or tomorrow, but in two weeks or a month. For that time, mindfully use. Be considerate of every craving - why and when it's happening, what happens when you use, the taste, the smell, everything. Feel it in you, feel it leave you. Then, start envisioning it as something having control over you in those moments, so as you are mindfully studying each aspect of the habit, you begin developing mechanisms and resources to overcome it. You realize when your kid screams you want to smoke...so in that time before quitting you find another outlet when the kid screams so you're more successful when your quit date arrives. 

Good luck to everyone along their journey -

I'm here at day 14 and I'm all over the place.  I feel like the first week was easier for me even though my head was super foggy.  I was able to feel more proud of myself because the struggle was easier to identify with heavy withdrawal symptoms, or something like that.  Now I feel a bit more clear-headed (dreams are still INTENSE AF), but my other disorders are popping back up.  I feel extremely depressed and am having terrible body image issues.  I struggled with an eating disorder for a long time in my teens and 20's (I'm 31 now) and I'm struggling again to feed myself.  For a little background, my eating disorder is EDNOS (Eatind Disorder Not Otherwise Specified), which basically means I vacillated between anorexia, bulimia, over-exercising, and bingeing.  

I'm anxious again at the grocery store, which sucks because it's already more anxiety-provoking since COVID began.  Weed was definitely helping keep my appetite up and masking feelings around food.  I'm aware that weed is used in extreme cases of anorexia and bulimia, but I have so many issues around substance abuse that it is most definitely not the right treatment for me.  I also have unresolved trauma that is making staying sober difficult.  Flashbacks are back already, and fuck, just so many things that make me want to use again.  

Also, I live alone in the suburbs of the Midwest where I don't feel any sense of belonging.  My parents are letting me stay in my childhood home while they are in Mexico for the next several years, so I don't have to worry about rent but I'm very lonely.  Obviously COVID is making meeting new people next to impossible, especially here where there is a lot of denial about the issue.  At least I have my 2 cats.  Thanks for reading this, whoever takes the time.  I'm just wondering who else is struggling in similar ways, and what you are doing about eating problems in these times and with similar co-occuring issues as you are working through sobriety.  It's like a sick game of whack-a-mole and I'm tired and angry and frustrated and sad.

I've taken a couple tolerance breaks before and always had trouble sleeping and waking up sweating. I've been reading on here everybody's troubles quitting along with there encouragement to continue (thanks guys/gals). So instead of going cold turkey I was trying to wean off, only taking 2-3 small bowls before bed, sometimes when i woke up id feel good, others I wouldn't, and when I didn't, I normally took a small toke to get back to ""normal"", then once I was high I'd find more reasons to smoke and that would cause a whole day of smoking, rinse and repeat for months.

 4 days ago I decided to quit, finally deciding its time to try and give it up comepletely, I took the smallest bong toke early in the day again(quick fail), and tried to nap, thinking ill wake up and stay up all night until I'm really tired then I'd have to be able to fall asleep... nap didn't work but I went to bed at 530 am, woke up at 730(sweating) then at 11(sweatier), felt tired but coffee got me back on my feet, next day didn't smoke and went to bed at 3 and up at 9, next day same thing. 

I've tried to be pretty conscious of mood swings/ cravings and all other side effects of quitting but they really haven't been that bad this time (for me), negatives are nothing close to the positives of not smoking. Weed made me tired and slow in every aspect of life, and I'd often catch myself thinking either absolutley nothing or complete nonsense. Still not sleeping as good as I used to but I feel 100x better, much more alert/ in tune with my body, in conversations I can actually think through my opinions, and use the facts I know to extrapolate how I came to these conclusions. I was honestly really scared to quit, it seemed so difficult and the idea of quitting haunted me every night, coming up with plans on how to get out of this mess thinking I can't keep living like this. Now on day 4 I'm asking myself why I was so afraid this whole time. 

This post isn't to say suck it up or to take anything away from the people going through serious withdrawals, but for people lurking this sub thinking about quitting who haven't given it a solid try yet, its not going to be easy, but it was way easier than I thought and wanted to encourage people that were in a similar situation to me, the hardest part for me was getting of the fear of quitting.

1 week clean: calmer, more balanced, higher lows and lower highs (if that makes sense) - in other words more stable than ever before.

Withdrawal: has been manageable, though occasional temptation, nothing that drives me back to the weed. Constantly repeating to myself that the symptoms are TEMPORARY. Even if they last a month or two. 

Looking back at myself: when I was using I was snappy and irritable, saw my family as ‚Äúin the way‚Äù. I don‚Äôt feel ashamed - I‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs over. My app tells me I would have smoked 35 spliffs this week and burned about 50 quid / 70 bucks. Holy S! 

Positive changes: I quit tobacco as well so I am breathing easier, running a mile or two a day, have more time for my kids and wife (and even my two cats have noticed the difference!). My lungs and head feel clear. I do not see the world through a fog. I dream like crazy.

Negatives. None really apart from some insomnia (harder to get to sleep, and waking up a few times). Some of my dreams are a bit disturbing. Constipation (sorry for the over-share). Occasionally feel a bit anxious - but breathing or going for a walk takes care of that.

All in all the fear of sobriety was far worse than the reality. 

I hope people find this encouraging. It‚Äôs been an extraordinary week and I‚Äôm quite proud of myself. There is still a long way to go, though.

Good luck to you all. This is going to change your life and even when things get tough, remember it‚Äôs temporary and, in the end, you‚Äôll be better off. Will try to post a 2 week update next Sunday.",37,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7714421}"

At this point it isn't about my brain getting physically healthier or my memory getting better, or my cravings going down. 

What's really struck me is, the longer I live a weed-free life, the more connections I make, the more my ambitions and passions start to stick, the more friends I make in the absence of weed. I've slowly taken root in a healthy and balanced life. 

Before 6 months ago, I had been smoking consistently for six years, with a few sobriety attempts here and there. But I had always quit for the wrong reason - usually because a guy wanted me to. This meant the quit was short-lasting and shame-ridden. So anyway, COVID struck and I relapsed again. I smoked every day, preferred smoking to being around friends , couldn't remember what I was studying, all the usual stuff. I was a slob. But 6 months ago, I knew I wanted to stop, because I knew I had it in me to lead a much better life.

Six months later:

* I landed an undergrad research position in a project that matters a lot to me
* I have so many friends, none of whom were made out of smoking together
* I'm not involved in toxic draining drama all the time
* I ride my bike a lot
* I care about how I look (in a good way)

I couple months ago, I felt as if my addiction was watching me from the dark recesses of my mind, waiting for the opportunity to pounce and reclaim me.

Now, I still get cravings, but they are eclipsed by a constellation of engaging passions and exciting possibilities. It isn't all sunshine and rainbows: I still have mental problems and life issues, but I don't obsess over them like I did when I smoked. I just feel like I've got bigger fish to fry than smoke weed and be sad.

Keep going, everyone. The future is better without being addicted. The withdrawal symptoms were bad at the beginning, but now 2 years out, I am much happier and healthier. Also, r/leaves helped me to stay motivated and positive, (along with outpatient rehab 5x a week) so thank you all.",586,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.87795234}"

I don't track days; I've learned the hard way that keeping track of progress stifles progress for me. But I admire anyone who finds it's motivating. 

I've tried quitting more times than I can count. A big part of me thinks that weed is the only reason why I'm alive. 

The last time I quit before this one, I went on a date with a guy who asked if I wanted to smoke. I'd already told him I was an addict, to which he (and so many others) said, ""It's impossible to be addicted to weed."" 

He told me he didn't want to smoke alone and that I should just smoke with him. I said no, but I don't mind if you do. No no no. I should've just left. 

He took a puff of a bowl, blew it in my face, and laughed. Then I went on another bender. 

Just before that, after over ten years of searching, I finally found a local person who grows organically and sells it for bananas cheap. He would often give me stuff for free to sample. I kept trying to quit, and he'd show up at my house with the latest thing he'd grown. I'd tell him I was trying to quit, that I was an addict, that I knew it was holding me back. He was just so excited to know someone else who was a connoisseur. I don't blame him; he was mostly confused by me.

Finally I stood my ground. 

But sometimes I wonder if weed was holding me back. But back from what? It definitely helped me feel less lonely. And care less. Care less about the world. Myself. My family. Caring is painful. I think not caring is normal and desperately wanted to be normal. Or at least feel normal.

I've chosen weed over myself my whole life. And food. I'm getting fatter now, but it's covid, so I guess it's okay lol who's going to see.

I don't know how long it's been. I'm so glad that /leaves is a thing.

It was about 11:00AM and I realized it was the first time I had been outside before noon in at least a month. Heck It was probably my first time waking up before noon in a month or so. I realized that I actually love the morning. Where I live its really clear until midday and then often becomes pretty overcast. So this was the first time that I was looking up at blue skies and walking around outside on a nice looking day in a LONG time. It made me realize that, without weed, I am actually quite a morning person. On the other hand, if I smoked the night before I would have easily stayed up until 3 or 4AM and slept until 3PM the next day.

I can eat which is a miracle and eating is better sober, I almost can't handle the flavor intensity now. Not to mention, I live alone with no pets or partner or spouse or best friend that always comes around. Nobody knows I smoke so I can't exactly vent to anybody either and can't go to a clinic or see a psych because my future employer will know and I won't get the job. Anyways I'm just here to vent.

First of, I apologize if my English isn't perfect, I'm not a native speaker.

I've been lurking on this sub for some time now and I am very happy to have found this community! Everyone is so helpful and kind to each other. It really helps me to feel less alone dealing with this 'problem' I have.

Last year, I quit for almost 6 months (smoking daily for almost 10 years). Got really stressed out because of work, and relapsed.
I'm in a country where you can legally buy, so the time between craving and buying isn't excisting. You can just go out and buy it.

So I did.
Told myself 'just this one time'. Made up excuses like I deserved it cause of the pandemic and it being the first night of my 3 weeks of summer vacation. 
I expected to not like it. Feel odd. And just not being comfortable.
Unfortunately, it tasted great and the high was great.

To make a long story short. I tried to moderate.. only fooling myself.
'Once every 2 weeks', 'once every week', 'only on weekends', 'only in the evenings'. Yeah right..
In no time I was back to smoking the same amount I did before: all day, every day.

For 'addicts' like me, 'just this one time', doesn't excist. 
I will never be able to moderate my smoking.
Fully quitting is the only way.

Please, do not make the same mistake as I did.
It's never 'just this one time'.
You'll fall back in your old pattern in no time and get stuck again in the same addiction you hated before. It's not worth it.

I found r/leaves about that same time, and was shocked that other people were experiencing the same problems I was. For example, posts saying ""when I'm sober I want to be high, and when I'm high I want to be sober"", ""I dug through the garbage to get back my weed"", and ""I flushed it yesterday but today I went to buy more"". I totally could have written those posts-- I've been through all that stuff over and over.

I first smoked weed when I was 18, and now I'm in my 50s, so it‚Äôs been going on for about 35 years now. But not non-stop, because part of the time I lived in places where I couldn't get it, and I was OK without it. But every chance I had to score, I smoked like a fiend until it was gone. About 10 years ago I moved to a weed-friendly state and got a medical MJ card, and then it was all-day-every-day until I started quitting in 2017.

Since 2017 I've been on a cycle of smoking hard for a while, remembering why I hate it so much, throwing it away, going without for a day/week/month, forgetting why I hated it, then buying more and starting the cycle again. I keep daily records on a spreadsheet, and since 2017 my longest quits have been for 72 days, 50 days and 21 days. My longest binges have been 43 days, 26 days and 20 days. More commonly, I'm on for a few days, then off for a couple days. 

Now its Day 1 again. Yesterday (which would have been a Day 2) I bought an eighth in the afternoon, had 2 sessions, and tossed the almost-full bag in the evening. I've done the same thing many times before. I think about the definition of insanity (doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different outcome) and wonder if that applies to me. On the other hand, I read about your success stories on r/leaves, and I believe that eventually I too can quit for good.

I've read all the tips on r/leaves, and have written a list of pros and cons that I look at frequently (with lots of cons, and only one pro: ""fleeting neurochemical satisfaction""). I try to get plenty of exercise, eat good foods, drink lots of liquids, etc. I've tried meditation, without much effect, but plan to keep trying that.

My main weakness is my low resistance to cravings. On my longer quits I've managed to resist for a while, and I've felt really proud of myself, but eventually give in. More commonly, I give in to cravings immediately. All my logic and rational thought seems to disappear, and my addict brain decides that I'll get high again, even when another part of me wants so much to stop.

So here I am, making my first ever post on Reddit. I don‚Äôt have anybody else to talk about it with. My raging addiction is a complete secret that I keep from my family and coworkers. I‚Äôm not sure what I want from this post, but felt that it was the time to start sharing my feelings and problems with sympathetic people who will understand.

Time goes fast, however. Today I'm beginning to come in contact with reality once again. The dissociation and the other weird mental states are starting to lessen their hold on me. My days are neutral, even good at times. I still get predictable flare-ups of PAWS if I don't sleep enough, or if I drink alcohol.

i just wanted to say thank you to everyone who posts here, whenever im struggling i come and read the posts, written by people on the same day as me. Thank you for not letting me feel alone in this journey, for giving me the courage to make a better decision for myself, for allowing me to forgive myself from the guilt of creating distance from my stoner buddies. Thank you to everyone here for reminding me that this is a process, one day at a time, for allowing me to also be there for people at times in the comments. Thank you u/subduction for being an amazing mod and creating this safe space for us to improve ourselves without shame. Thank you for giving me a space to angry rant, to post my anxieties, to remind me the nightmares are not me. Thank you for showing me i am not my addiction.

&#x200B;

For anyone who is struggling to quit, who is reading this while high (we all have been there, even me), who is in the first 72 hours (you will make it through), who is 15 days in and still crying and having anxious thoughts like me, id love to leave some advice:

&#x200B;

1. **create a list of reasons you want to quit weed. have the list in sight to read when needed. choose one big reason, write it on a sticky note and write today's date.** I have a sticky note from july 10, 2020 on my mirror that says ""weed makes me paranoid"" when i wanna smoke, i remind myself this is something ive known for x number of months, do i want to make myself paranoid? (I struggle with GAD/cPTSD, so it gets bad for me)
2. **if you relapse, its okay, be kind to yourself, forgive yourself, be with the lonely part that turned to weed for fulfillment and ask it what does it need?** love? a friend? security? and try your best to fulfill it, relapse is a part of the journey. we all make mistakes, a lot of us here have been smoking for many years, a pattern you've practiced for 3,4,5 years is not going to be easy to break in 1 month. im sure there are some out there that can say no once and stick to it, very impressive to have such discipline, but some of us come from difficult lives, broken circumstances, where discipline wasn't the healthy kind, or we couldn't cultivate the healthy kind for ourselves, and thats okay. honor your experiences. you cannot truly love yourself as long as you're hating the experiences that have shaped you. its never too late, you being here reading peoples posts and choosing to stay on this journey is a form of practicing discipline. thank yourself for choosing to be here, for choosing to try to fight your demons. appreciate the mini accomplishments like just getting through the hour, the craving, the day
3. **don't tell yourself you're an addict. tell yourself ""im not a pot smoker""** we humans love to attach ourselves to labels. i remember being a pothead was literally a part of my personality, i was proud to be a ""stoner"" and have a group of stoner friends. but now, i don't want to be that person. **i tell myself ""im not a stoner, im a healthy person who chooses healthy choices"". when i crave, i tell myself ""one day at a time, in this moment im making a healthy choice, im a healthy person""** once you identify yourself separate from weed, it gets easier. or so i felt for me. the labels we choose to identify with influence our behavior.
4. **meditation**. start with two minutes a day, build to five. im upto twenty minutes a day, when i get cravings i just meditate and focus on my breath. i can ground myself in my body, distract my mind from the craving and get back to the task at hand. what to do while meditating? count your breath. inhale-1, exhale-2. go upto 10. and start again. this is also recommended by neuroscientists to help increase focus.
5. **find a new activity to fill your time with**, reading, coloring, drawing, playing an instrument, running etc. you have to replace the serotonin and endorphin flood from weed with a different source of serotonin and endorphins. it may not be as intense, but at least you won't have the chronic negative side effects that weed does
6. the journey will be long, its a process and **progress isn't linear. one relapse doesn't make you an addict again. it makes you human, but in this new present moment right now you have a choice on who you want to be**, where you want to go, what you want to do. you are in control of your choices when it comes to weed. you made the choice to be on this subreddit, you can make the choice to quit or continue sobriety.
7. **creating distance from stoner buddies is important**. yes, even watching them smoke on FT/ video call while you don't can be a trigger. i don't blame my friends because i hold myself accountable for my actions, but i know 3-4 of my relapses were moments after friends sent me photos of their new goodies from the pot shop or i watched them light up over FT. they will still be your friends. you're not abandoning them, they're not abandoning you. you're just taking some space for yourself to work on your personal journey to becoming the best version of you. you have laughed and created cherish-able memories with them, those will always stay with you. one day when you are sure you're strong enough, you can go and create more. right now, you are healing yourself and it takes time and personal space. think of it like you're going through some personal therapy, and you wouldn't take a friend to your therapy session.
8. in 2019 i quit cigarettes, shouts out to halsey for the inspiration. i remember reading somewhere that **3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months are the toughest**, and they were right. 3 days the physically disabling cravings are there, 3 weeks the mental cravings/emotions are screaming, everything feels like a trigger, 3 months you feel apathy/sadness because life doesn't seem like it drastically improved or changed by quitting. but once you get through, it gets much easier. i havent made it to 3 months without weed, but 3 days and 3 weeks had a similar pattern for me. trust the process. you too will make it. we all will. believe in yourself, the key is to **truly believe in yourself**. find your mantra. mine's ""**one day at a time**"" don't really recommend this but on the tough days, i take a pen and write ODAAT on my hand or wrist as a reminder, i should just get it tatted at this point lol.

EDIT:
Can't really say it was one thing that helped me, or rather one specific thing. However here's a list of things that I started doing that I believe got me to this point:

1. Exercise (at least 10min a day)
2. Keto diet
3. Routine (allocation of specific tasks throughout the day)
4. Read ( at least a chapter a day, I started with Atomic Habits by James Clear, get better at getting better Chandramouli Venkatesan, why you do the things you do)
5. Consistent bedtime and waking up
6. Find a hobby, for me I pulled my old guitar out of storage and began learning again
7. Go out into nature, like parks e.t.c at least once a week, I live in a third world country and we have some ok parks.
8. WORK, can't emphasise this enough, Giving yourself purpose is good.
9. Spend time with family
10. Remove triggers like grinders, posters, bookmarks e.t.c
11. Condition yourself, by this I mean, like if there was a specific song, video e.t.c that you used watch/listen to whenever you tok up, listen to that song or watch that video again but this time while doing something else, it won't work the first, second, or third time but over time you'll disassociate weed from that specific thing.
12. Lastly there's no remedy for the stomach sensation, what I believe is, it's a necessary pain to get better, you have to go through the pain of withdrawal. To make it easier for myself, I reduced the amount and frequency of smoking gradually over time till I was down to one tok a day, from there the cravings and the stomach pain were manageable enough to quit cold turkey.

I got home from a trip and had lots of weed sitting for me at home, as well as a new vape I had ordered before deciding to be sober. 

Lessons learned:
1) when I was high all I wanted was to not be high 
2) I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was genuinely enjoying something or if it was just the weed
3) couldn‚Äôt trust my appetite

I‚Äôm actually really grateful for this. I read the book ‚Äúquitting marijuana‚Äù by Matthew Clarke recently (highly recommend) and he talks a lot about relapses. I am grateful that I had a relapse and have my head on tight the next day. 

What‚Äôs the useful takeaway here for you folks? I think the takeaway is that even if you feel like you are in the same cycles of actions and behaviors - the lessons you learn in each battle can still be applied and carried forward. 

In order to learn those lessons we *need* a gap. The psychosis and spiraling behavior is when you operate on that auto pilot mode, not questioning the things and experiences you‚Äôre feeling. 

If you relapse - check in with yourself. Don‚Äôt just be high and go on autopilot YouTubing and whatever- really check in with how you feel. Journal about it. Read the journal the next day. The lessons during a relapse are vital - the physical symptoms will help send you back to the daily use but the act of checking in can really serve as a reminder and a deterrent to prevent future use. 


I put the question mark near the ‚Äúon purpose‚Äù because I mean - I‚Äôm pretty sure we all have acted like we were in control when we weren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure what this was, hence the caution with myself. I don‚Äôt want to get cocky and act like I was fully in control.

I've struggled with addiction for 6 years or so. Started in high-school and now I'm on my way to grad school and still use it to cope with stress even though it adds additional stress. It made me so depressed and then I under performed at my job to the point I thought I would get fired. 

This pushed me to straighten up a little because I know I'm more than capable to do this job and do it well.

""Weed wont kill you, but it will kill who you could become""

2021-02-13 05:13:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lixyyw/been_smoking_my_entire_adult_life_had_a_clean/,"Been smoking my entire adult life, had a clean drug test this morning!","So I decided to quit smoking to get a better job, I‚Äôm in trade school right now to be an electrician and would like to work at an open shop. Even if the shop is ‚Äúcool‚Äù, I run the risk of being tested after any onsite accident which could be an insane headache, so I decided to give it up. Been smoking daily since I was sixteen, 29 now. 

It‚Äôs been hard. The job I work now (retail management) is way more stressful than it needs to be because the owners are, in two words, fucking idiots. Contrary to what you hear about retail often, I love most of my customers, but I‚Äôm constantly putting out fires the owners started. In one case literally. I haven‚Äôt been a day time smoker for years, just smoked at night to unwind, but it was every night. In the way that shit tends to stack, as soon as I quit things went sideways at work. The owners, in their infinite wisdom, tried to open a new location right when the pandemic started. They have had an eye on this location forever and the last owner wanted to sell when the shit hit the fan. You know how they say the word for crisis is also the word for opportunity? Well that goes both ways. The numbers have been shit since day one but right when I quit smoking, they decided to intervene in the store and fire half the employees to work there themselves, as well as stopping half the orders we are getting and turning the store into a live construction sight while trying to stay open. I figured I would have six months or so to find a new gig, but I see the take home and they have spun the location from loosing a few K a month into a fucking death spiral. I started stressing because I‚Äôve heard if you have smoked as long as me, your system can take a long time to clear. I was worrying about it this morning when, lo and behold, I saw that beautiful little negative line on the at home drug test I‚Äôve been taking every week. Mana from heaven. I think I might get it framed. 

Besides work being shit quitting has been a mixed bag. I‚Äôm not suddenly some kind of super sain, but I‚Äôve been reading more and, much to my surprise, enjoying playing video games in my spare time more. I had fallen into the habit of thinking shit is only fun if I‚Äôm high, and it‚Äôs just not the case. On the downside I do feel, well, mean. It‚Äôs one of the main reasons I kept smoking. If you meet me casually you would think I‚Äôm pretty relaxed, but I‚Äôm a high strung person, and my close friends know that about me. It‚Äôs been rough to see some of my casual friends openly trying to hobble my progress, asking me if I want to smoke after work when I have told them I quit. I didn‚Äôt expect that, I‚Äôve had friends get clean from all kinds of shit in the past and I always encouraged them, my brother is even in AA and I‚Äôve found ways to connect with him even though we used to be drinking buddies, we are closer than ever before if anything. 

I‚Äôm happy to see some pay off from quitting, but I‚Äôm stressed and scared about finding a new job. I‚Äôm a queer dude trying to break into the trades with limited experience. It‚Äôs not going to be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is. So I‚Äôm taking a moment to celebrate this victory and tell myself I‚Äôve fucking got this. it‚Äôs not just going to be okay, it‚Äôs going to be better than it was before. My bro is plumber, and once we have our licenses we want to start our own thing. I‚Äôve got my little light at the end of the tunnel, and that‚Äôs more than I could say a month ago. I don‚Äôt want much; I want to start a family, I want to do good work, I want to be respected by the people who matter. I hope this is the first step.

It was all day every day and was starting to seriously disrupt my life. Quit about a month ago, did it with my boyfriend who was my best friend for years and years before that while I had feelings for him all along. We hadn‚Äôt been a couple long, maybe a month when we quit together. We both had a hard time but did it together and that made it so much easier. 

This week he told me we were better as friends, I don‚Äôt want to get into that part because it‚Äôs not important for this post and just hurts. But the main takeaway is he wants to go back to being friends but it‚Äôs too painful for me and it‚Äôs just not an option to stay friends for the foreseeable future (if ever) or to rely on him as a support. 

On top of losing my main support and what felt like was the only person in my life who truly understood what I was going through, I‚Äôm in so much emotional pain. This was what I used weed to numb. It took away any uncomfortable feelings. This last month quitting was so hard, but emotionally and mentally I was in such a good place so I didn‚Äôt feel any feelings I wanted to put away beyond daily stressors and the adjustment to being sober. It was hard but the best possible circumstances I could have chose to do it under, it was the right time. 

Now all I want to do is turn this horrible feeling off. I‚Äôm not used to feeling these feelings sober. I want to smoke weed so bad and I‚Äôve been having an ‚Äúevening glass of wine‚Äù and it hasn‚Äôt gone beyond that but feels like I‚Äôm running still and I‚Äôm vaguely worried that may change.

I know I can‚Äôt drink during the day, it doesn‚Äôt do the same thing for me anyways, and all I want to do is turn my brain off. I want to get high.

2021-02-12 17:31:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/limizp/2_months_a_birthday_gift_to_me/,2 Months!! A birthday gift to me,"2 months ago I told my self that for my 21st birthday I wanted to be 2 months sober from weed. I had become extremely dependent and had been smoking daily (5-6 times a day) for about 4 years. I had tried quitting a countless number of times before but had always failed. two days ago was my birthday and I had finally reached my goal. First of all I want to express how grateful I am to have found this community, this became my escape and a community who's stories I relied on to move on from this phase of my life. The rest of this post is going to break down how I felt throughout the process, what helped me the most, and what I've learned. 

The first week was probably the hardest week of my life and it felt so incredible to be done with 1 week. That first week I felt sick, I had a constant headache, I slept 3 hours a night, I started dreaming but they were all nightmares. It was a mess. Week two felt the most encouraging, I could feel my body changing and things reaching a low point and slowly rising. slowly my headaches faded, my sleep schedule returned and I was no longer sweating uncontrollably. After the first two weeks the changes were a lot less noticeable and the every day changes in my body were not significant enough to keep me motivated to quit. Luckily I was able to make it to a month. The hardest part until a month was the intense cravings I would feel and how badly my mind would alter my thinking to justify me smoking. My entire motivation that got me to a month was that I had not told anyone I quit and I wouldn't let myself until I hit a month. I was so proud of myself at 2 weeks and my desire to share this kept me solid for an entire month. The second month was much different, and it was this month that I started learning what I was missing out on the past 4 years. I have slowly become more extroverted like I was before I started smoking every day. I have begun to build up my confidence again and I no longer feel super bad about speaking in group settings. My libido has returned and I went on my first date in over a year (didn't work out but I felt so in control without weed). I have started to enjoy movies again, try new foods, and I now have started to try and answer these impending life questions that seem impossible to answer like; what  do I want to do with my life. What kind of woman do I want to marry? and things like this. All in all I have not felt this good in years and it feels so so rewarding.

This next paragraph I will go into what I learned from this process. First of all you quitting weed isn't magically gonna make your day more interesting and make you do all the things you wanted to before. Instead it will provide you boredom and this is one of the worlds most important emotions. For so long weed smokers push away any chance at this feeling with weed. But being bored is truly beautiful. Your mind and body deal with this in such creative ways and this is the key to figuring out what you really want to do. Now you could just sit and do nothing and soak in this boredom, but more often than not this will cause you to do something spontaneous (relative to your own anxiety levels) like figure out your finances, draw a picture, call a friend. Another thing I learned in this process is that weed made me boring. I had no hobbies or passions other than video games and school. And quitting weed and experiencing boredom made me look into new things even if I don't do them a lot I now have something to talk about. Quitting weed reintroduced me to movies. I have always loved movies but only recently have I found myself crossing out the movies Ive always been ""too tired"" to watch. Anyways what I really learned was that life is truly beautiful and weed gives you an excuse to miss out on it. This excuse will drag you down forever until you say no more. I want life back.

Next I will talk about my mental health. I am someone who has always had pretty bad anxiety and this has affected me in both positive and negative ways. I am great at school but its pretty much because I can't stop thinking about it due to anxiety. When I started smoking I dealt with anxiety but not to the point where it was overwhelming. I started loving weed because how much it calmed me down and this truly did help for maybe a couple months. It isn't until I quit I realized how badly weed was causing my anxiety to explode. I have been controlled by my anxiety for the past 3 years and it is a terrible feeling. I feel like I've missed out on so much from friends, to girls, to finding my passions that I wonder if Ill ever get my college experience back. What I do know is that I finally have a relationship with anxiety that I have some control over again. I can choose how much anxiety I feel by choosing the activity levels. Before this I felt uncontrollable anxiety no matter what and that was because I was high 24/7. I felt dumb, I felt awkward, I felt scared, I felt people were judging me, I felt like I was bad at everything. Now quitting weed isn't gonna just stop your anxiety. But for me what it did was it allowed me to understand it and push the boundaries to find my comfort levels. One thing I feel really good about is driving. When I was high all the time I hated driving and felt so nervous. I always assumed I was gonna crash, hurt someone and go to jail even though I was a fine driver. I no longer feel this impending doom I once felt. I am slowly healing with one problem at a time. And its not necessarily because of quitting weed, but rather I now I can focus on healing instead of chalking it up to weed.

Lastly here are the things that helped me: 

You do not run 10 days into the forest and run 1 day out. This is great because most of us have been addicted for years and 2 months is just not enough time to truly heal. But you gotta start somewhere.

This is the reddit post that motivated me to quit and made me understand my WHY

[https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5yzwyr/tutorial\_how\_to\_quit\_weed\_and\_be\_happy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5yzwyr/tutorial_how_to_quit_weed_and_be_happy/)

Another resource is an app I use  called grounded that kept track of the money I saved and the time since my last smoke. It also grows a tree over time.

Lastly I would write down all the reasons you want to quit and remind yourself of those every time you want to smoke. For me it was: I wanted to not be anxious anymore, I wanted to be interested in girls again, I wanted to stop wasting my life playing video games, I wanted to be healthy, I wanted to save money, and I wanted to be around those I love with full intentions.

What you're feeling and the thoughts you are thinking, and even the dreams you'll have (around the subject) are an effect or symptom of this ""journey"", where you'll feel and notice the change occurring in your bodymind, as you are learning to live without the substance that is withdrawing. Sometimes it can be positive and you'll feel excited, free. Sometimes you get thoughts that crave weed, and that's just normal because your system hasn't yet gotten unfamiliar enough to the drug that has ruled over your thinking and decision-making for a long time, so these thoughts and feelings can pop up whenever.

Overtime though, it will get easier, as you will have more distance to weed, your thoughts will be freed to other things. I'm just a bit over a month clean, and I don't think about weed NEARLY as much as I did at the beginning (a 90% reduction compared to the first days). I guess my brain realises, that it isn't productive or useful to be thinking about it constantly, because I'm not smoking, so what is the point? Cravings will slowly subside and fade as well, although they might appear for a short moment, but they usually disappear quickly as well, and they aren't as strong. I don't feel like I'm drowning in their grip.

Being sober isn't always easy, there are many coping patterns and self-defeating behaviors and self-judgement, negative beliefs that still live inside. Now I'm at least seeing them, noticing them and recognizing them, and now I'm facing them, now I can deal with them, as I'm not trying to run away and putting them aside for later. I'm facing ""difficult"", uncomfortable feelings nearly everyday. I feel like a badass actually, like damn... **I can be** ***this*** **strong?** Some moments I feel like everything is great, I'm hopeful for the future and life is going well. Other moments I feel like I'm not good at anything, not capable, failing at life, worthless, nobody loves me, everyone will abandon me etc. It's really confusing and strange how it can change daily and sometimes moment to moment.

But even still, there are some moments where I feel incredibly aligned. I feel such strong emotions of joy, peace, acceptance, connectedness to others, that I'm encouraged to keep going in this direction. I don't feel good all the time, and in my opinion, if you think quitting weed will make your life feel fantastic every single moment; you're probably going to be dissapointed. Everyone faces ups and downs, people who've never used drugs or alcohol have rough times. But you can *grow*, **so much**, from those experiences, you can learn to deal with life like you never knew before. You can learn to be compassionate towards yourself, even when you are judging yourself and know you've made a mistake and in the midst of self-hatred. You can learn self-respect for being a badass mofo that gets through all the shit life throws at you, and that's huge.

I'm not here to tell you what to do, even while I would like to encourage everyone to get sober, it's up to you. It's not going to be easy or comfortable, although it can be and there definitely are good times, alongside difficult times. But in my experience, it's still worth it. If you want to become sober and keep relapsing, keep trying, you will get there eventually if you truly want to.

I've been trying to stop for 5 or 6 years, and somehow managed to slow consumption during the start of the pandemic and stop altogether a few months into it.

**The good** 
- It feels amazing to not be cloudy and tired all day long

- I can dream again!

- My appetite is back (although it seems to be insatiable and I've put on like 10lbs) - I find myself boredom eating alot.

- I finally got the promotion I've been chasing at work for 2 years!

- I've started dating a wonderful girl, and it's the healthiest romantic relationship I've ever had (she may or may not have been the catalyst for me stopping).

- My dog passed away a few months before I stopped smoking, and I can honestly say I feel like I've dealt with the grief a lot better since I've stopped (although it will always be there and I'll always miss the ever loving shit out of him).

- Energy! I have so much of it!

- My mood/irritability has improved infinitely. I can't remember the last time I was actually angry. When I was stoned all day, I found my self irritable ALL day and easy to set off.


**The less good**
- I still have issues with motivation, I thought by now I'd at least be a little more motivated to get shit done (clean the house more often, do a deep spring cleaning and get rid of tons of old shit, fixing up the house - coat of paint, new floors/floorboards)

- I also thought I'd be a little less inclined to spend hours after work just playing video games (I thought the weed kept me interest in the games), but it turns out I just really enjoy playing video games.

- The appetite, as I said, is insatiable.

I guess my only ""complaints"" are that I romanticized that I'd do a complete 180 after I stopped smoking and it would be immediate, but I seem to have forgotten these are real/tangible issues that I have to put effort towards working on, regardless of whether or not I'm smoking. It'll just be a lot easier to address these issues while I'm not stoned all day.",13,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.68874}"

I'm on day 40, and have had insomnia for the past 35 days, managing 4-6 hours a night of really poor sleep. It's kicking my ass, and last night I woke up nearly in tears at how exhausted I felt, before saying to my wife ""I'm genuinely considering going back to weed... I just **need** to sleep"".

It doesn't matter how early I turn off the screens, how healthily I eat, whether I have a hot bath, camomile tea, or over-the-counter sleep aids,  I'll wake up at least once a night, toss and turn all night, and then be fully wake up around 4.30/5am (and can't go back to sleep). It'a affecting my job, making day to day life a chore, and puts me in a bad mood every day.

For the last two weeks, I've been having vivid dreams every few nights, and while they're weird, they're not scary or nightmares.

Most of the posts I see on here mention having a week or two, maybe a month of poor sleep before things get back to normal, but mine doesn't appear to be improving at all, and it's killing me.

FYI, I have ADHD and am 31, but have never needed medication for it. Before weed (and during my 10 years smoking), I never, ever had a problem sleeping. I just can't deal with it, it's brutal.

I very recently joined and I've read through some of the stories and it seems like a lot of people here are younger and in a different place in life than I am. Good for you, realize the issues and quit now! I wasn't so wise.

I'm 30 years old and been a long term smoker for 7 years, but my life has been anything but stagnant. An ex boyfriend introduced me to weed and I was hooked from there. A natural thing that helped my depressed and anxious tendencies. Through that ex I met my husband. We dated, had fun, worked, got married, had 3 kids, and now here we are. Life doesn't allow me to be lazy, so that's not my driving force to quit. I get my shit done and then some. I barely get time to sit down. I don't want to say my kids aren't motivation enough, because they are, but in that regard I'm doing everything ""right."" They're never around it, they don't know it exist, I smoke strictly when they're in bed or otherwise occupied. They're still very young, I know that obviously won't last. They only see the good side. It does make me more patient with them, but I don't feel as present. The metal fog I guess? I'm terrified of not remembering the little things about their childhoods. I know they'll grow up and eventually put everything together, and I definitely don't want them to think daily marijuana use is okay. Especially as teen. I can not allow it to get there. 

Kids aside, I feel like I need to quit for myself. One day they'll move out and I don't want to slip back. My husband also wants to quit, but I'm not sure he's as ""ready"" as I am. He wouldn't purposely tempt me, but is there even a point in trying when I'll still know it's readily available? How do you find the will power to say ""No"" when it's right there? I'm also really worried about some withdrawal, mainly mood and appetite. I don't have time to be sick, I can't not cook for my family. I don't want to be irritable and yell at the kids, they surely don't deserve that. I'm always tired, so I do think I'll still be able to sleep lol. Ugh, how did I end up here?

2021-02-12 15:00:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lijcto/one_year_sober_and_some_of_my_thoughts_on_how_it/,One year sober! (And some of my thoughts on how it went),"As is fairly traditional for me a long post follows so if you've got a short attention span the TLDR is: I quit weed one year ago, whoopee!

Anyone else: some musings thus far. I know people read these posts, cos I do it too.

So this exact day one year ago I was high for the final time (touching wood, *always* touching wood.) I wasn't at the end of normal usage or a binge or anything like that, I was actually attempting to stop for not the first time (you know the score right?) and so my tolerance was starting to reset I guess.

Anyways, about a week earlier I had finally decided it was time to stop for good, cos it was quit or die. Sounds severe right? But that's how it was for me. That‚Äôs how low I had gotten.

And so I tried to stop and unfortunately failed after a few days. Didn't full on relapse though, just slipped. Only had one smoke, not a binge. Tried to stop again, slipped again. At that point *there*, I was exhausted. Physically and mentally.  I'd barely slept in days and I'd been vomiting in the mornings for I'd say a week at this point, thanks CHS! /s. I sat there and said to myself: ""You can have this one. This **one** smoke. But that's it. It's just so you can sleep cos you're *exhausted* nothing more. But we **ARE** done here.""

I rolled my joint with shaky hands. I still remember the hit. The MOMENT it hit. It actually got me high. See, for quite some time before that day the first smoke of the day did pretty much nothing for me. I was that much of a smoker my tolerance meant I never got high. Smoking just held me in place. Maintenance. That ‚Äúplace‚Äù by the way being the floor. I was at rock bottom.

I actually had tears in my eyes as I lit that last smoke. Felt shame at being so weak to give in yet again. Let the smoke hit me. It made me SO high. Not blissful, not amazing, but high. All of the thoughts and emotions hit me simultaneously. I could have laid down and passed out right then. I nearly did. But instead I continued to smoke it (as I always did, God did I always finish every frigging joint like my life depended on it) and grabbed a pen and something to write on. A McDonald's napkin no less.

By the time I'd written what I had to say my smoke was finished. I lay down and slept.

I kept that message for months. It was important to me to do that. And then, in time, I needed it less.

Lots of things happen between the last time you smoke and the year that follows. Lots of moments where you can take multiple routes. Some days are spent distracted. Just doing anything at all to not to that one thing. Or, as is often the case, spent doing nothing at all as that‚Äôs all you have energy for. We all have different reasons to stop just like we all had different reasons to start. We all have different temptations and crises. **But we can all stop.**

I don't know what's next for me. This day 1 year ago I was actively addicted to and abusing weed, caffeine, sugar, nicotine. Now none of those things are in my life. They go over there *points to vague place in distance* with alcohol as something M1NDFEEDER cannot consume safely. My life is so different now and yet also exactly the same somehow. I still have sad times, still stay up too late too often, have the same worries I had about the big life questions. And yet the anxiety, stress, being a slave to chemicals, utter lack of feelings and of hope...? Gone. Even in this Covid world we inhabit. I quit *just* before it took over the world so for me stepping back out into the world again really does feel utterly different.

I don't know how. But I did it. I got to a year. And reader? You can too.

I started smoking occasionally, maybe once or twice a week, just with friends, and it used to be enjoyable and a daring thing to do. The thrill of having a possibility of being caught, how stoned you actually get in the beginning, and all the laughs it bring with it was amazing. 

However, in the past 2 years, I‚Äôve moved out from my parents‚Äô house and lived on my own. Of course, being 19 and living alone, meant that I could smoke whenever I want, whichever method I want, how much I want. It‚Äôs all fun in the beginning, having friends who still live with their parents come over and smoking at mine, it‚Äôs finally having a safe spot to get high and chill without worrying of being caught. (I live in a country where weed is illegal). With living on my own, I started smoking daily, it almost became a ritual: Finish work, get home, eat, smoke a bowl or a joint and light up the PS4. I have a good paying job so money wasn‚Äôt a problem when it came to weed.  

However, the highs of weed were becoming less and less strong, and from sharing a joint with 3 friends and becoming super stoned I was now easily smoking a joint all by myself and still kinda sober, maybe a bit mellow.  Fast forward to covid, I started working from home and I got into  vape carts. This was mindblowing at first for me because where I come from a decent gram of weed is ‚Ç¨20-‚Ç¨25 so having weed vape was like the jackpot. Obviously, working from home with covid, I ended up having more time on my hand, and the ease of just vaping and getting high was too easily accessible.

I knew it‚Äôs time to stop, when the thrill and enjoyment of smoking weed ended, and it just turned into a mandatory routine which I do at night, almost like taking medication before sleep. The connection I had to weed in my first years just wasn‚Äôt there anymore, and I couldn‚Äôt sleep without smoking, and even when I smoked, I now started to find it difficult to sleep as well. I felt like I had no control over myself when high, and if I had the munchies then I need to eat something, whatever my cravings desire, even if it means a whole family sized chocolate bar at 3 in the morning, when Im working the next day. I became unmotivated and started getting lazy.

This is now my 5th day sober, and I managed to stop thanks to meditation, I feel more in control and I‚Äôve also been hitting the gym since last August. I feel more in control of myself, I have a healthy sleeping schedule, I feel happier and I feel more energized. Weed has been a great chapter in my life, and whilst the latter months were a downward spiral, I‚Äôm still grateful for all the experiences, friendships and laughter it gave me. However, it is now time to move on, to grow both personally, emotionally, mentally and professionally.

Even when I was awake and sober, my memory was shit. I‚Äôd literally not be able to remember what I searched up or why I did something seconds after I did it. I was constantly somewhere else mentally.

Im not saying I‚Äôm 100% back to being sharp mentally, but in just 11 days,  I feel way way better. I can concentrate a lot more, and I can actually think deeply and more importantly, I enjoy it. 

Sometimes it hurts because it forces me to think about the life I‚Äôve been living the past few years, but I know to progress, I have to take on these challenges head on. I can feel the shame and guilt from all the shitty things I‚Äôve done while I was addicted to weed, but instead of running away, I am embracing it fully. 

No more hiding the pain. No more Bandaid fix. Nope. This time, I‚Äôm taking the stairs up and I don‚Äôt mind. I know it‚Äôs not about the end result, it‚Äôs all about the journey. And so far, it‚Äôs been rewarding in ways I could have never imagined. 

Who knew having CHS and vomiting every day in agony would end up being on of the most beneficial things in my life. I hated the idea that I‚Äôd have to stop smoking but man was I wrong. And this is not to say I won‚Äôt be tempted in the future and that I‚Äôve conquered this. It‚Äôs a long battle. 

I hated the idea of quitting, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt live daily with CHS. So I took a leap into the darkness.. but as the days went by, I‚Äôve realized I didn‚Äôt plunge into the void, I‚Äôm finally stepping into the light. I know this all sounds cheesy, but the idea of quitting was so scary for me. I thought I‚Äôd be smoking till I was 80 lol. 

I believed it was my baby and that as long as I had it, I‚Äôm good. Now, I realize being a human means you have to deal with all of the ups and downs. You cannot numb it because the sadness, the pain, the anger that I used to numb is what creates growth. It‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt change at all for years while I smoked. The comfort zone is all that it is. Comfort. Growth takes place in the uncomfortable world. The world that you fear.

I've been a daily smoker of heavy dabs and high thc flower for about 2 years. I'm 20 years old and the weed has already starting ruining my life. It keeps me unmotivated, scared of the world, alot of anxiety, it adds alot of shit to tour head thats not supposes to be there. When your high, your typically high because you bored, if you get comfortable with being bored instead of doing activities for your brain (like you're supposed to when bored) your brain puts all these emotions into thoughts, you tell yourself things, you need weed, but you don't need weed. Weed can mentally damage you if you aren't responsible and I haven't been with weed. I'm 4 days sober now, got past the puking stage and its been alright just feeling very uncomfortable. I tried quitting June 2020 and I was off an on struggling to quit so for 3 weeks straight I was puking everything out at 5am. I lost 35 pounds in 3 weeks. After those three weeks the world really got to me with anger, (we can also inflate disorders and stuff too) I have BPD and Weed DOES NOT HELP. It only makes it worse, When I go into an Episode I completely sober up and it makes me even more violent. So Thats one reason I'm stopping. The drug can be good for figuring shit out , or smoking on occasion but the last year its been ruining my life, I haven't been able to accomplish anything for so long. I'm young, So I'm figuring this shit out now. I see all these people who smoke for like 10+years 30 year olds then they quit and hardly have symptoms of withdrawal and that's kinda insane to me. I also have seen so many 30 year olds have wasted all of there 20s on pot so I really don't want to waste the prime decade of my life on dumbass pot. Its great but it also makes you a dumbass lazy fuck to put in aggressively simple terms. I've only been smoking around 2 years and it feels like I need to die, no motivation, out of body feeling, gonna puke all the time feeling, stomach pains, digestion problems, it inflates mental problems. I just want to ask everyone, what as weed done for you the last few years of your life and if thats something your proud of. Then maybe make a choice like I have.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.88178396}"

""I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes.

Until this week when I told myself, it's time. 

I haven't been a stoner for super long (about 2 years) but at some point weed became a necessity in order for me to feel normal and like myself. The first thing I would do when I wake up was smoke a nice joint, I would continue through the day and then finish off with a spliff before going to sleep. 
Weed did a lot of good for me, it made me loosen up and learn how to relax, but the good effects were happening only up to a certain point. After I reached that point, from there it only started to go down. Now I'm at the stage where I feel like a prisoner of this plant and of my addiction. 

So here I am now, trying to channel every little piece of willpower I have left in order to challenge myself and break this addiction. I've lost my apetite since I stopped, and on day 3 I felt extremely nauseous and even threw up (probably more because of stress and malnutrition rather than bc of the lack of weed, but I still found it strange). 
Today, on day 4, I decided to go outside to get breakfast and coffee for me and my bf. I cycled past the coffeeshop but I knew I wasn't allowed to go there, so I didn't.
Later when my bf was leaving and he was collecting his stuff, he almost forgot his small baggie of weed at my place. I knew he was forgetting, but at first I really wanted to not say anything and let him go home without it. Then I could smoke some, and that idea was really taking over me. I stood there for about a minute, wondering what to do, should I give in? 
But then I said to myself, no, and I said to him ""hey, you almost forgot this"" and handed him the baggie.
The second I did that I felt a rush inside and then my entire being wanted to just ask him to please give me a little bit, just so I can roll one joint.
Somehow I resisted. 
After he left I was restless for about 10 minutes, just dreaming of the taste of one joint. But I told myself that the craving should go away if I let go of it and wait a little bit, so I decided to make my first post here. By the time I finish writing this, the craving has gone away.

For real.","I don't know if anyone remembers but I occasionally post here, I've been smoking daily for around 12 years and have known it's a problem for maybe 5 of them at least. This year I've made it to 5 or 6 days several times and my use has cut from buying an 8th every 2 days or so to not buying it at all. I live with my brother who smokes every day which is difficult and where I've had the occasional access to green. From what I can honestly work out I have smoked on 12 out of 43 days of the year so far. 

Since jumping on the *giving up train* this year I've also been looking for more stable work as I'm a freelancer in TV as it stands. Covid has ruined the camera assistant industry for the short-term. I've been through a long interview process at a studio that was difficult to deal with whilst the cravings were in full swing and I had a blip after the 3rd interview which was basically an in-depth psycho-analysis that, if I'm honest, is a bit of a red flag for me at the company I'm joining. I've had less in depth therapy sessions and left it feeling awful. I can turn a blind eye to it in favour of a consistent salary and some routine and I've been promised by the rest of the staff it happens to all of them once and it doesn't happen again. Came home that night and smoked a mini because I was fuming and full of anxiety, the second I had the first toke I regretted it because I was at 6 days clean at the time and as we all know it doesn't feel good any more. Then Tottenham lost to Everton in that weird 5-4 loss in the FA cup. Rubbish night.

But, **I got the job**. On reflection I don't think I would have dealt with the grilling I was put through if I was still smoking daily. I came home raging but didn't rage at them in person how I previously have done with employers trying to push my buttons, I was able to calmly answer their questions and concerns in a professional manner. Sure I chain smoked cigarettes in my car on the way home afterwards but I dealt with the 90 min *interview* well.  I wouldn't have applied for the job and gone through the stressful three staged process if I was still waking up and sparking one. I would have been too lazy, demotivated and lacked the self belief. Stopping my weed use has got me a job, with a salary, within 2 months. I wouldn't have done it without the clarity I have in my head now. 

I can forgive myself for the little bumps I've had along the way, the sleepless nights and nightmares have got too much for me a couple of times and I've caved in and smoked a mini at about mid day to take the edge off, have reset my counter and started again. The high has never felt good but I am not going to beat myself up for it, it takes many attempts to quit. Yesterday was the first day I've had with no cravings, no nightmares, no lack of sleep & no weed since I was at school. 

I feel incredibly guilty to myself that I spent my twenties with a reliance on weed. I've had a really cool life with some really cool jobs in some really cool places but I know I have wasted at least 50% of my twenties sat around not wanting to see anyone. The other 50% I was still stoned but I always thought I was one of those *functioning stoners.* I'm realising now that's something we tell ourselves to justify what we do. I've ruined relationships with friends, family and partners and have brought embarrassment to those people when I've been too stoned to meet people they want me to meet or go somewhere they want me to go. I'm 6 months away from being 30 and I'm not going to let it take that decade away from me. You only get one life and even though the days drag at the moment the years are only getting quicker. You don't get to live today again, don't spend it stoned. 

Now I'm on day 3 since that rage-induced zoot and this time I'm going to make it to at least two weeks and once I hit that I know I can go forever.

I've been lurking around on this subreddit but this is my second time posting here. The journeys of the amazing people of this community has motivated me to finally quit weed after using it almost daily for almost 1.5 years. I haven't been addicted for as long as a lot of people on this community but even during my short stent with weed, it has had a devastating impact on my personal and professional life. 

I'm a college student, currently in my sophomore year. I had used weed a few time back in high school but did not start using it frequently until November 2019. I had suffered a personal tragedy and was finding it hard to cope with college work and therefore, turned to weed to 'take the edge off things'. The world went into lockdown a few months after that owing to COVID and that's when the real trouble began. 

I don't have what we call an ideal household, so I decided to stay back and not go home. I was all by myself and had nothing to do with all the time that I had. Naturally, I turned to weed. My daily routine involved waking up -> freshening up -> hitting the bong a few times -> taking a shower -> hitting the bong a few times again -> preparing a barely edible lunch -> hitting the bong before eating and again after eating -> laying in bed watching TV shows/movies while stoned put of my mind -> hitting the bong again as soon as I started feeling that the effects were fading away -> struggling to prepare dinner and most of the times settling with instant noodles -> hitting the bong again until I finally pass out. This was my routine for nearly 10 months. A few of my friends returned back in the final months of 2020 and I tried my hand at moderation after that. I brought my daily consumption down to 1-2 joints per day but failed numerous times. Took a tolerance break for a week a month ago and was  genuinely happy during that period after a very long time.

I have decided to leave it for good this time but it's becoming unbearable for me. I suffer from depression, anxiety, childhood trauma and have extremely frequent suicidal thoughts. I don't know how to cope with life now. Weed helped me 'feel good' and kept my mind off things. I understand that I need professional help but I can't really afford it. We don't have many part time jobs for students where I'm from so I'm pretty much dependent on my mother for finances. Ever since I've left weed, I have this constant feeling of dread and my anxiety is peaking. I have a lot of college work mounted on my head so I can't really take a break. The pressure from college is adding up to my anxiety and I honestly don't know how to deal with this. From the moment I wake up, till the moment I go to sleep, I feel like giving up on everything. I am constantly frustrated. If anyone can help or give me some advice, it'd really mean a lot.

I have been trying to turn my life around. Im (23M) at a point in my life where I have to focus in moving forward with my career and smoking weed is a definite problem.

I been doing a lot of soul searching, reading, watching lectures and talking to people close to me. They have helped me come up with a question I can ask myself in any circumstance to keep my mind in the right place. The question is, ""Does this help me reach my goals?"" and  what a powerful question that is honestly. Asking yourself a question like that helps you to be objective and focused on your goals. When it comes to weed and I ask myself that question the answer is, no and that is clear to me, but I seem to be so controlled by the plant that I can't seem to move away from it.

I dont really have any coping mechanism which is probably already a bad thing, but I'm hoping I can get enlightened on some that have worked for others. I really want to move forward on this and not be controlled by this plant. 

Now, I never really had a negative moment while high, so all the memories I have from weed are good which I think contribute to the fact I keep coming back to it. But, even knowing all problems that come with smoking this plant, it still doesn't steer me away from smoking it. Can anyone relate? And what are some coping mechanism to deal with the urges?",7,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5465365}"
2021-02-12 00:09:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/li49fj/6months_weed_free/,6-months weed free,"Title pretty much says it all. To make it interesting, I'm adding some unexpected benefits and drawbacks. I hope it adds a little more encouragement to a fellow leaver. Best to worst:

\- My digestive system is 2x better, this is often overlooked because people focus on the lungs and mouth. Stomach is better, a lot less acid. I've never had a gastritis episode again, which was common before, in more anxious periods. I can drink coffee and eat pepper without any problems. Intestines are slower and process the food better. If you have these kinds of problems, research the correlation of smoking and digestive system and you will be impressed. Whoever says the intestines are the body's second brain has a point also;

\- Heavy dreaming period has not stopped, a quick 1h nap is enough to go to another dimension and remember it later. This is pretty crazy... At first I liked it a lot, because after 10 years of smoking everyday, I had forgotten the ""fun"" of dreaming and then researching its meaning. Now it's just ""meh, here we go again, I dream and remember it everytime"". 10% of them are very cool. 80% is nonsense somewhat related to daily life or future concerns. And another 10% is past people or smoking, rarely. No nightmares whatsoever;

\- Stoner friends are practically gone, but not the way I expected. They've actually ejected themselves from my presence one way or the other, some more radically (like with arguments or misunderstandings), others just faded away. I did not have, or even wanted, to avoid them. The fact that I quit was bluntly put (pun intended) and I kept my word, so I guess it was somewhat of a menacing thought to them and they've unconsciously found their way to keep away, but this is just my interpretation. Enjoying my own company a lot more anyway, so? Nobody believed I was going to get clean, but you always judge the world the way you are yourself.

Another thing concerning stoner friends is that I now clearly see through their bullshit, addict excuses and how ""slow"" they get when they're high. It's a little cringy to think ""was I like that?"". I never bring the topic up, but they always do... It's funny because I let them do what they want, but it seems to me that my mere self brings them to question their decisions and they have to re-affirm them somehow. Not convincing me, though, and I'm not getting fatigued by this, you do you;

\- Gained 26 pounds, I've been working out, but it's obviously not only muscle mass. I've only realised it last week and I'm 6 feet, so not so much of a big deal. Probable cause is I'm enjoying the food more, so look out for that one if you have weight problems already.

The expected:

\- The learnt discipline spilled to a lot of other stuff I was trying to quit, like porn, Coca-cola and then soda, etc. Working out everyday. I'm killing it in these as well;

\- Better routine, I take better care of my teeth and overall better personal hygiene;

\- More cash, both by being more productive and spending less on unnecessary stuff. Cooking more, which is cheaper and healthier;

\- Social anxiety is practically gone and random people approach me more.",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4232881}"

Not saying smoking is bad, cuz it helped me through some shit but after a while it just turned into a crutch. I been battling depression for maybe 3 years but deff longer if I think about it. Weed just shoved it aside until it didn't anymore. Everything added up, I needed more out of life. Now I can say I went from getting paid 15$ an hour to 26$ within this time frame, got out of my grandmother's house and out on my own, and starting to lose the weight I packed on since graduating high-school.

It feels weird to see that number. I never thought I‚Äôd escape the talons of weed. The best decision I‚Äôve made in my life so far is getting sober. I‚Äôm writing this to highlight to myself, and to y‚Äôall, the negativity that weed can bring into a good life. 

I‚Äôve tried every drug excluding heroin and meth, and I‚Äôm confident in saying weed is by far the most sinister, sneaky drug I‚Äôve encountered. It has a way of slithering into your daily habits and begins slowly and develops its frequency gradually. This, giving the individual a false sense of security in self-control and discipline. Now, I‚Äôm not sure if this is purely a chemical phenomenon. I believe a part of it is to do with how weed is portrayed as a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô and ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô drug. 

No drug is safe, or purely healthy. Everything in life has consequences whether you want to believe it or not. Marijuana has serious consequences connected to the circadian rhythm, dopamine regulation, long term planning, majority of executive functioning, speech, memory, and more. This is not a harmless drug and it should be taken more seriously than it is in our culture. The negatives outweigh the positives with frequent usage. This is a fact; and is such for most things that are overdone. 

Don‚Äôt let the voice guide you into a deeper hole of despair, addiction, self-hatred, and lost potential.
I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat anything. You probably aren‚Äôt a great person, but you ALL are worth something to YOURSELF. Once the discovery of your true self is liberated from the blurry eyed, foggy headed blur/fever that is being high, you will be able to view yourself for whom you truly are. 

Love yourself first and foremost. This is the HIDDEN first step. Yes, I know it seems like there is no solution. But if you make a TRUE effort to love learning about yourself, you can learn to fill your head (and physical day) with things you love to the point where weed will NOT be the first/only thing or priority in your mind.

Today is the first day I don't feel like absolute crap from the withdrawals! So that's awesome!
Here is the hard part
I also started my period today and, as I always do, I have HORRIBLE cramps. Regular pain medications barely touch them and usually weed is the only thing that will take the edge off. I'm trying so hard to 'tough it out', but knowing there is something that would enable me to function while in this much pain and not being able to have it? Fucking sucks. 
Maybe I'm just fooling myself into thinking it actually helped. Maybe it numbed the physical pain, but also just numbed everything so the whole ""funtionality"" of it is something I've made up in order to keep smoking. 
What I think I'm trying to say is I could use a boost. I don't know if my mind is playing tricks on me or if the weed actually helped.

I don't worry if I can take care of my kids anymore. However I do feel more dumb than normal. Almost like I've lost a super power that once was my quick wit. Also like I've gone from never being sick/hurt to aging at a rapid pace physically. 

&nbsp;


**All of this started after a few bad bowls and some trips to the ER in June/July.**

#Previous post:#
Symptoms after 45 days:

1) Nerves constantly aching after any moderate use - specifically calfs/lower leg and arms.

2) Loose shit every morning.

3) Feeling like I couldn‚Äôt focus

4) Red in the middle of my eyes

5) Panic attacks

6) Massive health anxiety

7) Brown specs if deep cough (intetionally)

-----------------------------------
#Now:#

1) Nerve pain in lower legs and arms still remains, if I do anything physically intensive. Nothing noticeable when stationary. Feet will go numb if I bend at waist for more than 60sec, arms go numb if i raise above head and apply pressure for more than 60sec. - My best guess is I have overdeveloped compensatory muscles and underdeveloped primary muscles. Working on posture/proper breathing and strengthening certain muscles. (increasing thoracic space and glute strengthening). I get tension headaches a lot but they seem to be related to strained neck muscles/nerves.

&nbsp;

2) My gut issues have resolved. Magnesium seemed good for mind/relaxation of muscles but once I stopped taking it, my stomach/digestion got better.

&nbsp;

3) Focus seems relatively normal now. I started taking Lions Mane last month and I've found it really helpful for this. Focus is kinda reminiscent of that initial 20min after the first bowl of the day. Just no high, if that makes sense.

&nbsp;

4) Redness comes and goes. The worse i feel, the worse my eyes get. The better i feel, the better they look. So they are in someway connected to all this. 

&nbsp;

5) Panic attacks have leveled out big time, generally not present anymore. Certain things trigger them 100% of the time but I can't figure out the connection. Triggers: NAC (4 hours after taking it), high dose Vit C (a few hours after taking it), Agmatine/Citrulline  (6-7 hours after taking it). I'm able to control them even after triggering them bc I know it will go away. If I persist and repeat taking the supplement, they will get stronger in intensity.

&nbsp;

6) Health anxiety TLDR every test you can think of says Im fine. Most days I try to believe it.

I can often convince myself everything will be fine but sometimes I spiral. I mean, there's so much going on that just doesn't make sense. I was able to get all my health records in digital form. I have multiple CBC & urinalysis + 24hr urine test, thyroid test, A1C, ANA, B12/folate/B6/D vitamin tests, contrast imaging of my entire abdomen, Contrast MRI of my C spine, T spine  and brain. The only abnormal results were slightly elevated Normetanephrine, which a Endocrinologist deemed ""fine"" and slightly elevated BUN but 100+ GFR so just high protein diet/mild dehydration.

7) Still coughing shit up, small brown specs - definitely probably maybe tar. Only when I really get a good deep mucus. I have a theory on this one and its related to down regulation of the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

8) Headache/migraine: I gave up drinking but decided to have 3 glasses of wine on new years. I got the worst headache/hangover of my life the next day. Haven't dared touch it again. I seem to get this intense headache every now again that feels the same as it did that morning after. Almost like a glutamate rebound headache. But might be histamine. When i take high dose folate or any Histadine I get the same headache. Always peaks at noon and goes away by late evening. I started smoking a cigar in the afternoon for 2 weeks straight to test a nicotonic acetylcholine theory.... always felt kinda crappy 10min after finishing. After I quit I spent 2 days with that same horrible migraine (this one lasted all night).

&nbsp;

9) Inflammation: Some days I wake up and my skin will be lightly red (if pressed). If i scratch it'll turn into a red mark/bruise easy. Both the sensitive skin and bruise/red mark goes away by the next day usually. Again, possibly a histamine reaction.

Just wanted to post because I came to an epiphany today for something that i've been struggling with for a while. Whenever I am anxious, it becomes really hard for me to eat. ive always been someone that doesnt eat a ton but it gets worse during stress. one of my therapists once pointed out that by starving myself, I bring my anxiety on bc my body goes into flight or fight mode due to hunger. 

One of the reasons I started abusing weed was bc it took away the hunger pangs that I endured. I would be able to go to bed without eating bc it would numb by stomach pain and put me to bed. 

Fast forward and when I was stressed I literally had to mentally coach myself for every bite I took. Someone putting a sandwich in front of me and trying to eat it in less than 30 minutes was torture. It got to a point where I started to gag as I tried to eat. I knew something was wrong but thought it was anxiety. 

I decided to stop smoking when I visited family where I didnt have any access to it. The withdrawls for the first week were intense and I vomited lots of food that I was able to force down which was particularly painful seeing as it was so hard to eat in the first place. 

But once it subsided, something amazing happened: my natural drive for eating returned. I opened the fridge one day and had a natural drive to want to eat something which had not happened for me for MONTHS. 

I've felt so much better and so much more like myself since quitting. I just wanted to post bc I know everyone thinks that weed makes you hungry/munchies but for me, chronic weed caused the very opposite.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5446484}"

So I‚Äôm currently a 19 year old college student and I‚Äôve been smoking daily since I was 15. I was first introduced to weed by my friends when I was 14, end of freshman year of high school. I didn‚Äôt really like it at first. It made my throat burn, and it got me really fucked up for hours. But smoking quickly turned into the only thing we did when we hung out with each other, so eventually I started to like it. Start of my sophomore year of high school I was smoking every single night once my parents went to sleep. This continued on for about 6 months until they finally found my stash and caught me. I remember my dad telling me ‚ÄúThis stuff will take away every ounce of ambition and motivation you have in life.‚Äù Of course I just brushed this off, because what does he know? I‚Äôm still getting good grades and feel fine, why should I put down the weed? Little did I know he was 100% right. 

So I took a break from weed for a couple months until the heat died down. Then, carts became a thing. I thought this was awesome because with carts, I could smoke all I want and theres no smell or suspicion. The convenience of carts amplified my addiction to weed 10 fold and I was smoking them all day everyday throughout junior and senior year of high school. My grades were still good, and I had just gotten accepted into my dream university so I felt I had no reason to stop. I also worked a lot and was very good at managing my money so money was never an issue for me. 

Now comes along freshman year of college. No parental supervision, I could smoke practically whenever I want ‚Äî and I did. My grades started to slip up and I started failing classes for the first time in my life. But I didn‚Äôt care. I just assumed everything would work itself out like it usually does. 

Fast forward to now, sophomore year of college. I‚Äôve failed at least 1 class per semester so far. I have absolutely ZERO motivation and ambition. My memory is completely shot. My diet is shit. I don‚Äôt exercise. I have quite literally lost the ability to think long term and make decisions. My mind is in a constant state of fog. I‚Äôve finally come to the conclusion that weed is what‚Äôs holding me back and that I need to quit. I feel like such a loser. All I do all day is smoke, jerk off, and watch TV. 

I know that quitting weed won‚Äôt solve all my problems, but its a start. A start for bettering myself. I need to focus on things that will make me a better person like practicing guitar, reading, and actually studying. Regret is something that scares me immensely. 10 years from now I don‚Äôt want to be living with my dad working some dead end job just because I couldn‚Äôt put down the weed. I have dreams and aspirations in life I want to achieve. 

If you made it to the end of this, I can‚Äôt thank you enough. I need your guys‚Äô support more than ever as I start this journey. Weed was a HUGE part of my identity throughout my main developmental years so its going to be tough. But sobriety is something I want so bad. Any words of advice or wisdom is greatly appreciated. Thank you all again for reading, and I‚Äôll check in soon.",205,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.37952757}"

I'm 32, started smoking at 14. Have been smoking everyday pretty much since 18. Towards late 20's it go to a point where I had to stay high to consider any activity remotely tolerable. Except at work, I assumed everyone knew I was baked and it's just not a good look or feeling.

I am a Anxious person by nature. Especially, socially. An ex said it best ""My default when I meet someone is I assume they hate me""  When I heard that I thought, damn that's so real.

My tolerance is such that I have to smoke a lot to ""feel it"". We all have our own indicators that make us feel the proper amount stoned. Mine, oddly enough, was anxiety.

If I smoked and didn't get anxiety, I wasn't high. I had to smoke more. MY habit got so bad that I was actually inducing anxiety on myself to feel satisfied when smoking. Wth? 

I now realize that even if I wasn't stoned, I had lowkey, baseline anxiety....all....the....time. It wasn't until I quit recently and really sat with my feelings that I was able to come to this conclusion.

I hope this helps anyone who's using weed and solely weed to self-medicate for anxiety. We're all a little different but there's a chance, even when not directly under the influence, the habit is causing you more anxiety. I still get anxiety and I'm only just beginning my journey but quitting is doable, friends! I never thought I'd make it 2 days, let alone going on two weeks! 

Unless you live with habitual smokers, the pandemic is a solid time to quit for trigger avoidance!

I'd still read but would take way longer since I'd have to force myself to make time for it when I wasn't high. Which sounds so dumb.  

Now I'm like, ""Oh my god!  Books!! I missed you guys!!!""

I said to myself at the time I needed to give up. 

Years went by of deteriorating mental health/ relationships/a relationship with myself and patches of trying to give up/cut down/attend support groups/lying to myself/counselling/shame and alot of negativity. 

It took me years to become fully aware of my relationship with weed and to build up the confidence and motivation to want to fight against the hold I let it have on me. 8 years down the line and it took an external factor/event for me to truly commit to giving sobriety a go with kindness, positivity and compassion. 

I accept I will never get back that time and it hurts that I did that to myself. I remind myself this is how my journey has played out and keep moving forward with positivity and all the knowledge I have gained through these learning experiences.

I am at the beginning of my new adventure, 6 days in. I have experienced a lack of appetite/sleep, heightened anxiety, struggling with motivation, very emotional, aches and tension in my body. I FEEL ALIVE and present. 

I am not over thinking the possibility of lapses/relapses, that fear is no use to me. For now I am committed to myself and for the first time in my life, I am dedicated to chasing the life I want.

Life is shite but I'm living my best possible version in this moment, I owe that to myself. 

A big thank you to this community, it has been a massive help and a daily reminder why I keep fighting.

However, after that stupid vice documentary released, I finally counted 1 and 1 together and realised, that most of the weed I had been getting was laced shit and that I was addicted to those synthetic cannabinoids. After that, I was I able to quit almost cold turkey.

In the first weeks, I smoked a joint or two with friends and took a last bong hit once, which made me kinda pass out. I was unable to move, had to keep my eyes shut, it was honestly embarrassing. But that was probably due to it also being this laced shit.

I stopped smoking around Christmas when I was visiting my family. Usually I'd meet my friends in the evening to smoke but because of the Rona and curfews here, I couldnt so I just didnt smoke. I was amazed how easy this week was so I tried to extend it for as long as I could and yada yada, now I am here, almost over a month clean! Yay

In the beginning I was dreaming so much and vividly and I loved it, hoewever, lately I've been dreaming about the Deutsche Bahn and my trains being delayed so much, that it really annoys me. Ugh. Not even having nightmares about my own life, no, I dream about my nemesis the DB.
Wish that would stop happening.. 

Anyways, long story short, I really love feeling like shit again when I don't do my chores. I love how I am more invested in my non druggie friendships. I love the existential dread when I dont keep up with my uni work. Life is so hard and its amazing!

I've been severely depressed and anxious the 2-3 past years or so, which makes quitting harder. I had 2 relationships back to back that were abusive. It got so bad i ended up doing self harm once (only once). I  ended up taking a year of college and moves back home.

Now I'm in my last semester and i was doing ok before quarantine. But being stuck inside killed what little mental health progress i was making.

2021-02-11 08:49:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lhl0cs/transformation/,Transformation.,"I met Mary for the first time at twelve, it was two weeks before my next birthday and my best friend and I decided to see what this world was about. I‚Äôll never forget that day, sitting along the side of the road with her and my slightly older neighbor friend. Finally it was my turn to take a hit, I held that hollowed out highlighter shaking with fear of the complete unknown. I didn‚Äôt get high that day, but my friend did. Watching her have the time of her life over the simplest of things lit a fire of excitement for the next opportunity to mingle with this sacred herb.  

That opportunity didn‚Äôt take long to come. Nor did the one after that, or the one after that. In fact once I stated getting high I never wanted to stop. The euphoria, community, music, culture all felt so exclusive and exciting. I created an identity around it all, and didn‚Äôt even take a sliver of awareness to realize the hindering effects that would soon become my downfall. 

Fast forward to two years ago, I finally started to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù to myself again. An abundance of epiphanies flooded my consciousness, one being that smoking wouldn‚Äôt get me anywhere anymore. In that moment I hadn‚Äôt figured out why, but today I come with a lot more knowledge. 

Smoking so heavily from such a young age for over eight years has taken a toll. For one, my ability to deal with and process heavy change and emotional discomfort is limited. The state I grew up in most of the time was disassociated, disconnected, and at times euphoric. Feeling those deeper emotions that have built up over the years terrify me even to this day. 

Yet, despite the scariness of it all, I made it 67 days clean.That‚Äôs the longest I‚Äôve gone, well, in eight years. The differences were dramatic, I was finally crafting a life for myself and starting to heal instead of repress. I learned that I would rather feel the deepest hurts if it meant I could also enjoy the joys of life again over complete numbness.

 Last Saturday I threw that streak down the drain. I‚Äôve been smoking everyday since. I read relapse posts before it even happened to try to make myself feel better, and convinced myself that I would be the one special case who doesn‚Äôt get hooked again. It‚Äôs like I forgot the hold she has on me. The hold I have on myself with smoking in attempt to pause all of the internal chaos within. Trying to holt the inevitable events that I have to move into. I‚Äôve realized when I smoke it takes me back to an era without responsibility, a place where I‚Äôm just a kid again. But I‚Äôm not, I have a job and school and things I have to do if I want to become anything in this world. I don‚Äôt think people who haven‚Äôt had an addiction like this realize how hard and rebirthing it can be to go cold sober because your living life with an entirely new intensity that was never possible before. Everything by itself feels new and overwhelming, I need some motivation on putting the pipe down and take the rose colored glasses off. To not just get sober, but thrive. 

If you don‚Äôt change the life you live as a whole and just go sober, your still going to be in the same environment that made you want to smoke.

Long time / first time yada yada. I've been smoking almost daily for the past 10 years. Been having a few breaks here and there - vacations / sober october a couple of times - however once those breaks were over I would dive back into heavy daily use like nothing happened.

I am now 1 month in my quest to do at least 3 months of no weed but in my heart I am ready to say no to the devil's lettuce for a lot longer than that. Thing is I need to be the real me once again. I didn't start in my teens so I can clearly remember how I used to be and how I didn't use to need anything external to feel good really. The main reason I want to quit is that weed gives me anxiety. I constantly felt bad about being high again, about trying to avoid contact with neighbors or work colleagues. Any issue that would arise or every negative thought that would pass through my mind I would associate with the fact that I am high most days.

The journey has not been kind so far. Worst day was day #5 followed by days 18-28 or waking up with brain fog, feeling tired or unmotivated most of the time. Best day so far was day 29 which was the first in which I really felt kind of normal. Not euphoric, not happy even but not tired or depressed. Day 30 and 31 are not as great but are way better than days 18-28 were.  

To all of you trying to quit:   
1. don't expect to have a linear recovery  
2. don't expect to back to normal in less than 3 months  
3. in your worst days a hot bath and some tea can do wonders. Drag yourself to the gym to get some endorphins going even if you feel like you can't do anything that day and that nothing really matters  
4. no matter how long you're into your sobriety and how bad you feel at that point always remember that at least you are 1 day closer to being your normal self again - which in my view means freedom.

I had a nearly month long streak a bit ago, but then got stoned for 10 days straight.

Currently at day 1, but I am up super late because I always get insomnia when I quit weed cold turkey. wouldn't be surprised if I ended up awake for a whole nother 12 hours, or more!

Anyways, I want to share something with y'all - something I've never shared with anyone.

It's somewhat common for people to say, ""weed brings out the worst in me,"" or something like that.

Well, weed is so irresistible to me, that I steal it from my friends/roommates.

Yup. This is a habit I've had literally for years. Roommate at work? Just go in their room and take a phat rip of their weed.

Pretty shitty thing of me to do, right? Probably easily one of the most shameful things I've done. I've been stealing weed from roommates over the course of like 6 years. No one has ever caught me or let me know that they suspect me. 

There's no way no one ever figured it out. I wouldn't be surprised if at least one of them got wise of what I was doing, but just felt like it would be too much trouble to call out their roommate and get on bad terms with someone you live with. I have no idea how much weed I've swiped from people. I have no idea how much distress or disrespect people have felt because of my actions.

I realize this is immoral of me as fuck, my friends don't deserve this, and I am objectively a shitty friend/roommate.

If you want to say something mean to me, go ahead, I would be nuts to tell you that you're wrong.

2021-02-11 07:24:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lhjn02/day_4/,DAY 4,"good morning all - day 4 here , heavy smoker for I would say 15 years , my parents grow it medically here in quebec, canada , so for the past 5-6 years I've been being given ounces at a time. It was never something that was financially an issue for me - just very lonely and depressing. Actually I feel like when I smoke weed I do not love myself, I am not amazed by simple things like a sunrise or little birds singing. Anyways - I was off for two months at the end of 2020 and relapsed when a 'friend' gave me a huge hunk of hash (which I thought I could hold onto and resist til I gave to another of my friends who still smokes) needless to say that did not go well and I ended up smoking it and after it was gone I bought some more and smoked that. Just ran out last Sunday, its funny because I was looking forward to running out of it, you know?

To get back to clarity. First two nights not on weed I slept really well, last night I feel like I did not sleep at all, or that I was waking up every 20 minutes to go to the bathroom or something. The dreams were wild, so much better than weed actually. And I woke up feeling super rested strangely enough. Even if I didnt ""pass out"" and wake up after 8 hours as what usually happens when I smoke. Anyways, its a bit scary for me to be sober, I find sometimes that there is just too much time, troo much boredom, and to be honest when I do not have weed I become addicted to other things, especially female attention, girls are like a drug to me and if I am not careful when I smoke week I am just too much with them and even if one really likes me I will push her away with my neediness, or if I try to do something that I love, like read or sing, a little voice in my head tells me I would be happier if I smoked. I dont want that, I want to feel completely intoxicated by my passions all while staying sob and I want mature relationships.

I am happy that I am on day 4, I am well rested and strangely healthily restless, I just need to be careful to not become addicted to something else when I am not on the plant... I hate how groggy and shitty weed makes me feel, I am a complete loser when I smoke, but am just strange and mysterious when I dont and I prefer that. It helps to have this chat, I do exercises, play music, cook to pass the time, I feel like meditation would help and there is a lot of talk about this on here, I just have not been able to try it yet even tho I know it would be good, nor sure if my mind is even capable of slowinggg downnn at this point.

basically long post but this is my story more or less thanks for reading and if youve made it this far I would like some advice from you, if you meditate, and if it does wonders for your mind and body, how would someone like me who is probably undiagnosed AD-HD of something slowly ease his way into a regular benificial practice? I know my problems extent beyond weed and I dont want to shift my addiction to someone or something else , I feel like my passions are good but am still afraid I will become addicted to phone/girls/beer if I do not at least give meditation a try.

It feels like weed is everywhere and I have now my second medical card from a new state...how can it be bad?!?  I know you know that answer.

I never really admited to it until very recently. I think this is common amongst potheads, more than it is in regular smokers.

Because pot makes you high, we tend to be more defensive of it, because it's not just chem addiction, it's also the habit of having your conscience altered 24/7.

As much as I hate (and always have) potheads who claim weed to be ""spiritual"" and ""cleansing"" and are people I know who just need to justify their constant consumption, I'm no different. I've denied it a million times, but I do hide from reality with weed.

I don't think I can progress much on my anxiety if I keep smoking every time I get it, it became my only coping mechanism and it sucks.

Today was my second day of starting to quit and I didn't manage to do the one thing I promised myself to, not smoke first thing in the morning.

I didn't have lunch and am already stoned out of my mind. 

When I opened up the window this morning, I saw a big cloud of smoke whirling and mixing with normal air. Of course, it isn't the first time I see this, but with this mindset, it did shock me. How am I supposed to feel motivated to do anything if I literally live in a haze?

I used to strongly believe weed didn't interfere with my performance, but it's not true, it does. I have to concentrate harder to get anything done, I feel disabled sometimes.

Towards the last few months of 2020 I really started to notice the changes my use had made within myself and how i was no longer using it recreationally but rather abusing it more than i ever thought i would. i would constantly have the desire to stop my habit but was i was just so dependent on it to deal with my problems and emotions. I started to hate myself and what it made me become , i quit my job and was just blowing off a lot of important shit that i needed to handle at that time, i also felt emotionally numb and was watching my relationships with family members slowly deteriorate.

A few months later in January 2020 i got my own house. And it went from a enhancement in the weekends to daily use after i got the key. 

I loved no one telling me i was smoking to much and there u was going down hill again. I moved 30 minutes from amsterdam driving there evrey other day picking up 5 grams to smoke in 2 days. Wasting my gas now( expensive in europe) and money on the weed. I loved the first 6 months. But after those it hit me. Im dependant again. 

As soon as my weed was all smoked i started to feel uneasy again stressing to get the next 5 grams. Meanwhile i felt shitty sober lost my job due corona. So it was wake and bake evreyday. Living in this shell. I gave up working out drawing tattooing all i did was smoke and play my switch or ps4. 

Even though it hit me. I couldnt quit. Promised myself tonight will be the last night. The next mornings i woke up and drove an hour back to amsterdam again. 

I made 5 days wich were horrific ( i dont think i fully comitted i knew it was the better option but somehow i wasnt ready to let go. After that i continued my addic ways again.

 Untill 4 days ago. I couldnt keep living like this. I needed to save for a future with my girl and a child in the furute. And most of all finding peace within myself and being the person i am instead of this numb person. 

I got adhd and depression but whatever. First day was the worst. I know im only at day 4 but today it something switched. I feel proud and a little bit euphoria like having a wiff of coke ( havent done that in years). It kinda scares me but i rather have this than feeling like  sack of shit all day getting no enjoyment out of anything when im not smoking. 

Like the title says. It robbed me from my mood and the only way it felt like i was getting it back was by smoking a way too much amount a day.

I live in North America, far away from my home country, all alone, by myself. I was cut off work due to COVID when this whole mess just started last March. As I could not find any other employment opportunities, I was upset, depressed, and constantly blamed myself for not doing more than I could (sit at my laptop all day long and apply for jobs). 

I moved to a new city where I stay alone, and only have 3friends that I could talk to about anything and everything. During the lockdown, I tried to follow all the public health guidelines and did not leave my house, unless for essentials only. That being said, I started smoking weed. 

I finally got a job in October, and things have started looking good and I even bought a ticket to fly back home and visit my family, but then again - LOCKDOWN. I started to smoke even more than usual (I normally smoked once every two days - three puffs each), which is every single day (0.5 pre-rolls). 

I do my best at work, but then again, feel bored once I get home. Last week was tough, a person who was close to me has sadly passed away. She was only 50 years of age. It was shocking and very depressing, I smoked, I drank, I did not do anything, and I had to cope with it by myself. My friends and family supported me of course, but it is just not the same when it's over the phone. When I got back to work, I found out that one of my colleagues got fired, while another had passed away this week. Again, I felt as if I was cursed. 

I don't blame weed (in fact I feel like it kept me sane), I don't blame anyone or anything, and I know that if I stay strong I can overcome such hardships, but damn, now I even want to smoke more than before. I want to relax, forget about everything and just eat and watch something on YouTube. But then I think about my life, and I feel like I am lost. 

Long story short, I am scared to get addicted, but for some reason cannot stop thinking about cannabis. Should I just stop smoking (I've been clean for the past two days), or should I just reduce my THC consumption? Please advise, and remember to stay safe!

I stopped smoking on January 21. I am in a job hunt and just have a lot going on, and the stress was building up. So I stopped so I could more easily deal with the emotions. I really have no strong cravings to smoke anymore, so that's good.  


Now, as many of us experience, the stress is hitting me like a pile of bricks. It also feels like years of unresolved stress coming to the surface.   


It's been hard to keep up with my regular exercise routine as I don't want to go to the gym until I get my covid vaccine, although I do try to do what I can in my home.   


I don't know what it is - if it's the dreams I'm having or just my environment (I have been getting some cabin fever lately as well) - but it's essentially unbearable. I might have little pockets of feeling happy or content here and there but overall I feel this overwhelming stress that is not only mental but physical, too. Like feeling pressure on my eyes, in my head, feeling dizzy/lightheaded. Randomly feeling extremely depressed or anxious. I've napped for the last two days and still slept for 10 hours last night (although it was interrupted by dreams a number of times). And I could probably take another nap right now if I laid down.   


I'd like to hear from someone who has had an experience like this and got through it.  I really feel like I could use a therapist or something, but they are hard to get ahold of and I don't know if my insurance would even cover something like that. The thought of this lasting forever terrifies me and I honestly can't survive feeling like this forever.

I've never been to a meeting, but I'm familiar with the 12 steps. I know about the steps for making amends. The person I'd most like to apologize to is my ex. We dated for over six years and I feel awful for how things ended. I put weed above him. That's the sad truth. For a while, I was angry with him. I felt abandoned, betrayed. And, yes, I still believe he could have treated me better. The same is true for me. I could have respected him way more. I can't make amends with him. I mean, I could. I have a new phone number now and I could reach out. But I won't. He made it very clear he didn't want to speak to me again. 

The thing is, I realized what I really want is to forgive myself. I want to stop hating myself for having this addiction. For not being able to walk away sooner. For not seeing the damage it was causing. There's a part of me that's so mad at myself for what happened. There's a part of me that feels I lost the love of my life. And, objectively, I strongly believe that's impossible. Everything that's meant for you finds you. But yet I am so saddened by the way things ended between us. 

I think what's also upsetting is seeing what an awesome person I am now. I know, how is that upsetting? But I dated someone after my ex from Sept. - Dec. 2020 and I really saw how much I've grown. He said he loved how stable and grounded I am. I couldn't believe someone calling me stable! But it's true, I am now. I'm calm, I'm centered. I'm in a really good place mentally. And when he randomly ended things with me in Dec. because he ""wasn't feeling it"" I replied ""okay"" and blocked him. I didn't fight, I didn't chase him. I accepted it and let go. I was upset, of course. But I realized he was kind of a jerk and I want someone who's sweeter to me. 

The truth is I had been realizing he wasn't as great as I initially thought. He shared his emotions, which I really liked. But he didn't care about mine. He didn't care about how his actions affected me. There were so many red flags. For one, he didn't get the struggle I had quitting weed. He said he did, but he didn't. He claimed at the beginning he rarely smoked, but it seemed like he smoked quite a bit (probably because his roommate was a big smoker). He brought in a nugget when I was over with his sister (also a big smoker) and was like smell this it's gonna be awesome. I was like...*no I don't want to smell your fucking weed*. Now that I'm typing this, I'm realizing the universe did me a solid by removing him from my life.  

He was also super insensitive about the fact my dog was nearing the end of her life. I had her since I was 9 (I'm 25 now). His advice to me was basically ""dogs die it's apart of life."" I remembered the way my ex was when my other dog was dying in 2019. I remember us sitting in my car. I was crying. He told me ""Reese is going to die. But you're going to be okay. You will get through it."" Long pause, ""And she's going to go somewhere she can poop."" I remember laughing through my tears. He was so gentle with me. Of course, that all changed. And I can't blame him for not wanting anything to do with me. I just wish he knew this me. I wish I had learned my karmic lessons with someone else. And met him now, when I was sober. 

Anyway, I felt bad comparing the new guy to my ex. But I realized my ex was really great to me at times. I was really great to him, at times. But, once my addiction to weed took over, I really changed. I became obsessive and psychotic. I was downright nuts. I ended up in a psych ward for three weeks last year, right around this time. You think that would have made me stop smoking. Nope. I thought about it. But one of the nurses told me weed might not affect me badly now that I was off all the other psychiatric medication. It took another two months for me to quit. 

I know this is a long post and I'm not sure what the point of it is. I'm working an overnight shift and I'm trying to take a nap but started crying. I've been thinking of making a post about guilt for a while and figured maybe it would help to type it all out. And it did. 

If anyone has anything to share on their journey towards self-forgiveness, I'd love to read it. I've written my ex some letters apologizing and burned them. I'd never send them because his mother really dislikes me and I know better than to mail anything to that address. But writing them and burning them has been cathartic. I've also been apologizing to myself. Saying internally and out loud I forgive myself and what's most important is that I'm really proud of who I am now.

After I got out of the hospital my dad supported my weed addiction, since being high won't kill you. 

I replaced all drug use with smoking more weed and cigarettes then any 15 year old should. I would buy an oz every 2 weeks and be chain-smoking literal bags of cheap native cigarettes all so that I could sleep.

Then we abuse it over and over and our normal drops from at 8 to a 4.

Creating a situation where even with weed we cannot reach a normal mood like we once had. All we can reach is a 6/10 existence.

I'm a 25m who just made it one week without weed and porn. I've had a toxic relationship with both of these addictions for an embarrassingly long time. I know this sub focuses on just weed, but I want to talk about both because for me they are very intertwined and I think for many others they may be too. 

I used weed and porn to cope and self- medicate bipolar depression and anxiety for years. Nothing could distract me better from my feelings and fears better than that combinations. I wasted SO MANY HOURS over the years with these addictions. Not to mention money. Not to mention the effects on my relationships or my views towards myself and women. This seriously fucked up my college career as well and never finished university. I've actually gone back since I originally dropped out years ago and have been doing well. I would quit for the school semesters but always crawl back during breaks. 

I've tried to quit a few times before. But so far I'm happy to say this is the easiest time quitting I've ever had. I've hardly been tempted by either porn or weed, both of which are both readily available in my house. I'm going to get rid of the weed today. As far as porn, I use this reddit account which is only subscribed to recovery subs like Leaves, Pornfree, and LoveAfterPorn. I NEVER go on /r/all anymore. Too many accidental triggers of porn and weed. 

As far as my experience this times goes, I've faced very little temptation. I'm just focused on finally graduating my classes and staying motivated. I'm trying to distract myself with schoolwork and the hobbies and dreams I've always brushed aside for my addictions. If I can pick up a shift at work, I do. I try to go to bed early. I try not to be totally alone.  LEARN YOUR TRIGGERS. Prepare when you're strong so when you're feeling weak, it's as easy as possible to stay the path. One hard truth is that if you want to quit, you may have to change more things in your life than just the act of smoking.

I can definitely feel my body changing. I can feel my hormones settling out slowly. Some days I feel pretty shitty tbh, like no serotonin at all. Others I feel awake and motivated.

I started smoking weed when I was 17 and did it occasionally (once every 2/3 weeks) with friends I've known for years. I've always been the ''Eww smoking it smells and it's bad'' kinda person but with the help of friends I got into it.

At 18 years old I smoked every weekend and had a lot of fun times. Made more friends, got more creative with rolling joints and was overall having a good time.

Turned 19 years old and smoking has successfully became a habit of mine.. fuck. At that time I knew it wasn't good for me but I've made sooo maaany friends because I smoke. Did a challenge with a friend of mine to not smoke a whole month and both succeeded. We celebrated with a joint because we proved ourselves that we are not addicted :'')

Here I am at 20 years old smoking daily. The pandemic doesn't make it any better too. I really want to be free of this substance man and I know a lot of weed users have or are in my situation so I would appreciate some words and other perspectives.

I realized something big a few weeks back and it was that it's not necessarily the substance that's keeping me stuck but everything coming with it. I've made friends with at least 5 different friend groups, all activities I do with close friends include smoking (like going to the cinema, play basketball, gaming, etc.).

I really want to remove this substance from my life but my biggest fear is that I'll live a completely different life and have to say bye to all my friends...

Most of our relationship I‚Äôve been clean from it, but relapsed a couple months ago and I‚Äôm starting the quitting process again. Friday will be day 1-if not sooner (in the past I‚Äôve had more success ‚Äòspontaneously‚Äô quitting but this time I keep delaying it so have set a date). After I had a panic attack last week when we were discussing it I found the courage to tell him I recognize weed is taking control of me again and I NEED to quit-he responded by justifying my use and telling me if it‚Äôs ‚Äúhelping‚Äù to do what I need to (during over a year off it my panic attacks stopped-STOPPED!!) I felt so unheard. When I brought it up later he said if I need it then he‚Äôd rather be with me like this than loose me. I don‚Äôt think he even recognized the harm it‚Äôs causing. He tries to be supportive, but clearly doesn‚Äôt know how, which is fair because I don‚Äôt know what I want/need from him to give me support. He is not a weed smoker, so that simplifies things a lot.

I decided I need support so contacted a friend who told me recently he was worried about me and was there if I needed to talk. When I opened up to my friend he told me it was obvious something was wrong and that the last time he saw me I didn‚Äôt even look healthy! He asked what he could do to help hold me accountable and make sure this wasn‚Äôt just a passing conversation. Until then I felt so invalidated and unheard that I felt like I was loosing my mind-it was making everything worse. Having someone actually acknowledge what was going on, be there for me, and respond positively literally made me feel sane again.

I‚Äôm a 20 year old male, I‚Äôve been smoking since I was 16 and high everyday since I was 17 pretty much. I barely get high anymore and it doesn‚Äôt seem to help my depression and anxiety anymore. I think I developed amotivational syndrome from smoking at a younger age and continuously while my brain was meant to be developing. I have become a shell of a human than smokes an ungodly amount of weed. I‚Äôve tried quitting myself but I honestly was not able to. I feel lost, numb, empty and worst of all the cannabis can no longer keep my suicidal thoughts at bay. I can no longer financially or emotionally afford this plant. I love it to pieces and I wish I didn‚Äôt have to quit. But to have a normal life again, to have a life where I can make something of myself and support a future family, I need to sacrifice the one thing I‚Äôve held close to my heart for years and literally smoked it for every occasion (good, bad, happy, sad, holidays. Etc). I don‚Äôt know how im going to do this but I guess that‚Äôs what rehab is for?(i don‚Äôt know what I will do with my time, what I‚Äôll do after work as a reward, what I‚Äôll do on my spare time if it‚Äôs not looking for new strains to smoke)...I love to learn about the plant, learn what strains are which and what terpenes they have. I love looking at pics of weed and just my whole life is consumed by weed, it‚Äôs my personality, my interests and hobbies, my whole lifestyle revolves around weed.  But I‚Äôm aware that needs to change, that‚Äôs not what life is about, I need to learn to find happiness in life because I know a) I can‚Äôt afford it b) my lungs can‚Äôt afford it, and c) emotionally it‚Äôs causing more harm than good (according to everyone around me). Thankfully, my family is being really supportive and I‚Äôm super grateful for that. I‚Äôm going to start therapy again in March and then work my way into rehab perhaps by the end of April or in the month of May. My goal when I come out is Im going to take up my hobbies of photography and get a click and grow hydroponics kit to grow vegetables, and start cooking with those fresh vegetables. Thank you for reading :) 

TLDR : Im a 20 year old 4 year smoker and I think it‚Äôs time for rehab, but I‚Äôm scared of giving it up. I could use some advice thank you",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3641915}"

But quite often I was often feeling empowered and almost giddy about it.  I told myself not to get too excited.  It was probably a honeymoon phase.  

Things do get harder.  Eventually I had a very flat period where I felt I was missing some excitement in my life.  After all, my secret life of weed was action packed with the related stress of hiding something all the time.  But there was another form of excitement growing from within. 

I sit at 9 months since my last relapse and over 25 months total free of weed since I started the journey.  Now I know that the growing positive feelings within were not too good to be true.  Those feelings of empowerment are as strong as ever.  I can't describe the feeling of relief each time I realize that I am not stuck maintaining that high life forever.  I was so sick of that rut. Now I am finding joy in parts of life that I had been ignoring for years.

I quit smoking as of NYE and while some aspects of my life are better, some are worse.

Background information: I was never a huge stoner. I smoked for about 2 years regularly, 5-7 times a week but only after I‚Äòve done all my work, mostly at like 9pm and/or before workouts. Also, I smoked really low doses, like 1 gram per week.

Since quitting, my relationship is slightly better (shes a non-smoker) and I‚Äòm sleeping more.
But I‚Äòm struggling to put on weight and I‚Äòm a lot less motivated to workout and to work in general. I‚Äòve become comfortable with watching TV and eating sweets sober, things I just liked doing stoned before - therefore I‚Äòm doing these more often

I really want to be sober, because I‚Äòm scared of getting a DUI and to not have to hide this habit from family/neighbours etc. but I don‚Äôt know how to be my motivated self again

Quitting is easy for me, guess I was never really addicted - no withdrawals whatsoever 

Is there someone with similar experiences?

For me it's a little different. I like weed, I generally have a very good time when I'm high and it definitely makes me very creative but my line of work at this phase of my life demands more of a manual labour kind of man... like I run the errands, close face to face deals, supervise our family owned restauraunt, cashier, packaging, delivery sometimes. I'm supposed to be like we say the ""joker card"" ready where I'm needed to be. I'm 23 and I've definitely been there and done that, successfully so... until mary dontuwanna...

It keeps me in my comfort zone, makes me lazy minded and not want to work, moody, easily flustered and generally at a lack of focus....

It was going well. I was on for a good run until December with just a few social occasions where I ended up smoking (I was still very happy about it since my habit particularly came from smoking alone before sleeping). 

Then I relapsed for about a month. I didn‚Äôt think too much about it when I was smoking. At first, I muted every thought that was questioning my relapse.  And when this censorship finally came down, I couldn‚Äôt find the motivation to start again. I had this mental debate for weeks about quitting. If it was worth the struggle, it is only one joint a night in the end. It won‚Äôt give me scary long term health problems, plus I was doing much better than my friends who chain smoked for weeks. I was finding every possible reason to cling to it. For a while it convinced me. 

One day, I decided to open up about it to my partner, she is aware that I wanted to stop but she have a ‚Äúits your life I am not here to force anything‚Äù approach, she helps me only when I ask her to. During this conversation she reminded me of all the reason I wanted to stop. That it is still the same person that took this decision in September. That I am doing this for myself and it is not about a rational debate of pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs. It gave me the motivation I needed and I leavesd again 3 weeks ago. I had my fair amount of cravings but this time was so much easier than the first time and I feel proud and on a great run. Maybe the run.

All of this to say that it is okay to relapse. It is okay to feel demotivated after it. It is normal and even inevitable for some. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that the fight is lost. The 2nd one may even be easier.  Motivation was very important for me, blocking triggers too. It was also crucial to communicate my need to stop, it made it official, concrete. And even though it may be scary, because it is scary to relapse in front of others, to feel weak in front of your partner/friends/whoever,  I am sure that for a big part of us it is a crucial step. It is very easy to build walls that prevents us from quitting. Walls built by nothing else than yourself that represents an obstacle for you.

My drinking was bad enough I joined a 12 step program. I haven't had a drink since. Those 12 years I fantasized about weed relentlessly, but I smoked no weed, drank no alcohol, had nothing except for some pain meds following a major surgery. However there was plenty of fantasizing about weed. 

In October, I gave myself a pat on the back for the years of continuous sobriety. I smoked and I enjoyed it. ""I can smoke weed as long as I don't drink. Alcohol was my master and weed was my buddy that made me more musical and better at video games."" 

Fast forward 4.5 months. I'm smoking every day. For the last month I'm smoking first thing in the morning and until the end of the day. I'm high in my new management job at work. I'm high when I'm lifting weights. I'm high when I'm meditating. I'm high going to the OB to see my first born's ultrasound. I'm not enjoying it. I'm doing it because I have to. I have a new master. 

I told my wife everything. We set a date for 3/17 for me to quit. We have a lot going on and we didn't want to shake anything up just yet. Afterall, it's COVID and there are fewer social consequences for my behavior. Thing is, I couldn't wait until 3/17. I needed to rip the band-aid off and just be done. 

I smoked for the last time on 1/30 and haven't looked back. Days 1-5 were awful. Nightsweats. Nausea. Migraine. Short-fuse? Completely non-existent. Days 6-8 side-effects started to subside. My fuse is still short, but most of the other symptoms have waned. My vocabulary is returning as is my desire to be present when before I just wanted to smoke. 

I'm built to be addicted. Both of my parents and three of my four grandparents struggled with addiction. Alcohol was my master and so was MaryJane. It only took her 3.5 months to completely take over my life. She didn't have that power when she competed with alcohol, but on her own, this mistress ruled me. 

My experience is my own. I can't promise your withdrawal will look like mine. Maybe yours takes 2 days - maybe it takes 20. I can promise this though - it does eventually get better. 

Today, I am looking forward to life and I am thrilled to be clean. Each day I move through life a little more gracefully. In May I get to be a sober dad instead of a stoned dad.

I'd read over things multiple times and still miss some of the typos. I'm in my mid 30s and thought ""damn, maybe I'm getting old and having a lot of brain/finger farts"". I even wondered if I was experiencing some kind of weird late onset dyslexia. I always took pride in my writing and would almost never have typos when I was younger.

Turns out it was definitely the weed. After 2 months of sobriety, I'm no longer producing typos anymore.  I'm not putting any special effort into avoiding them. They just don't happen.

A long time ago, when I had just discovered weed and thought it was simply terrific, a girl I dated for awhile on and off once told me in this very casual and matter of fact way: ""weed makes people stupid"".

She was 100% correct. I can now say from experience that heavy use puts a *huge* tax on the brain. It stunts cognition in ways that can be hard to realize in the midst of it, and that may be falsely attributed to other causes. As someone who makes a living with my brain, it's just a terrible tradeoff. Even if weed had otherwise purely positive effects (not at all the case for me), it wouldn't be even close to worth it.

This is my first post here. I would just like to share that in 2 days after today I will make my 50 days of no weed. I lit my last joint on 23/12/20 and after that I made the goal to stop smoking weed. I am really glad that I took that goal and I am still staying true to it. Weed was both a fun and a bad chapter of my life.

I started smoking when I went to The Netherlands for my university studies. At first I was smoking rarely(once - twice a month)  and I was doing it with my roommates. It was fun and these were one of my best times during my first year of university, cuz' I finally started getting some friends. I didn't make any friendships with my classmates during my first and second year, because people were scared of me(that's what I heard from a classmate) and weed was better than people.

During my second year of university, I moved into another house with other roommates, that were pretty heavy smokers. My first year of university was very stressful and I didn't quite get the opportunity to enjoy the student life cuz' I was too busy with school and so I decided that my second year will be more chill (big mistake). I became friend with one of the heavy smoking roommates. We started smoking and getting along. I made a rule that I will smoke once a week every Friday. After a month this rule was broken I would smoke 3-4 times in a week. This was really bad, because my brain was in a complete fog 24/7 and university work started lagging. Somehow I managed to survive the first semester, but I failed too many subjects. 

The next semester came and with it the first corona quarantine. My university closed and also the gyms. The gym was my only hobby back then and I would abuse it. Without university and working out in the gym I lost myself. I ordered a bong and started smoking everyday to feel good. I was really stressed and the only two things I was doing were smoking and eating. I completely ditched the university. In April I went back to my home country, because there was no point in sitting in The Netherlands, since uni was online. Living with my parents again and having no weed was a nightmare for the first month. After that I managed to find a dealer and went  back smoking again. After the semester was over ( I failed a lot of subjects again) I went to my grandma for the summer. In the city where grandma lives weed is more accessible than bread is. My dealer is my neighbor and his weed was good. Since June until the end of August I was smoking everyday 2-3 times a day both alone and with friends.  

Thankfully, a friend of mine ""slapped""  me in the face by saying : ""What are you doing? Why are you smoking so much? You were never like that"". This made think about whether I was  having a problem, but I shrugged it off at first. One night my dealer offered me and a friend to come over and smoke. This was the night that made me realize that I had a big problem. We smoked a lot. If I remember correctly, we smoked 6-7 joints, 4-5 full bowls from an ice bong and concentrate from a vape pen. I was so high that my brain was like spaghetti. I could not even talk and I could feel like that my heart and blood pressure was going to explode. After that I came back home and passed out on my bed. This was the heaviest smoking I have ever done.  I took a break for 3-4 days and hopped on smoking. On the 27th of august I smoked my last joint with my friends and went back to live with my parents.  My third year in uni started and it was serious business and I felt that I had withdrawals - couldnt sleep, 24/7 thinking of weed and very unstable. Somehow I managed to control myself and didnt smoke for a month. I liked the idea of smoking once a month as I made it a goal and stuck with it. But I was always thinking about smoking weed. I picked up other hobbies to keep myself busy - programming and reading. 

To conclude, I am happy that I went through all this as it taught me a lot about myself and to be careful with whom I become friends and hangout with. Also, it made me realize that weed is not for me and I would rather have it as a memory in the past than as a friend in the present.

On my second attempt at quitting cold turkey atm, did about three weeks last December before giving in and relapsing on a trip back home. Before quitting, I was smoking pretty much everyday for 4/5 years.

On Day 17 now, generally I feel okay. Not the massive awakening I was expecting from giving up weed, but I know I feel a lot better than when I was smoking it and I needed to give up so I could save money, be kinder to my mental health and start focusing on my important things in my life such a school deadlines and relationships.

My deadline for my school projects is tomorrow (Thurs) and I‚Äôm almost finished with them, but now I can see the end in sight I‚Äôm starting to have cravings for having a smoke. It‚Äôs on my mind constantly. The first couple of weeks I wasn‚Äôt experiencing any that bad but suddenly these past couple of days I‚Äôm starting to sink into a depression and feeling like only weed will pick me back up. 

Anybody have any tips to combat these cravings? I really don‚Äôt want to fall back into the cycle that I‚Äôve been working so hard to get myself out off.

Thanks, btw I really enjoy reading everyone‚Äôs posts here and the encouragement in this community! Makes me feel less alone to know I‚Äôm not the only person that struggles with the ‚Äúnon-existent‚Äù weed addiction.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6018607}"

I told him today just how guilty I was about not being 100% sober, and my fear that I‚Äôm essentially not able to function (being super depressed all the time) without it. Saying it out, I started tearing up.

The cravings are still there but I push them to the side with the assistance of exercise.

I had a plan to use the week of PTO I was about to get allotted so I could detox without fear of losing sleep or being distracted by withdrawals, the perfect plan for me to get my life back on track... 

But then monday rolls around and I have no PTO. Still says I have 7 more hours to work before I get my PTO like it said on Friday. So despite being on 2 hours of sleep and starting at noon, I worked for the day. Now it's Tuesday, I have my PTO, and I have a choice. Do I hold out working through the withdrawals for a week so I can take next week off when the effects won't be as bad? Or do I take the rest of the week off, not use all of my PTO, 
attempt to detox in less time? Or do I just say fuck it and smoke today and start detoxing next week?

In my heart I know which one I *should* do and I know quitting is the right choice for me...but fuck, I want to just say fuck it. I want to relapse even if it's just to feel awful about myself and feel the disappointment of failing in my goal. This is my first real attempt at quitting cold turkey (before it was for tolerance breaks) and part of me probably wants to fail before it's too heartbreaking.

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this tbh. Maybe I'm looking for validation that other people want themselves to fail, maybe I'm looking for someone to tell me it's okay to let myself relapse, just this once, maybe I'm just venting because I don't know anyone else I can talk to about this.

But the biggest difference is that I‚Äôm not even trying this time. I am genuinely repulsed by the thought of smoking.

Then Before i knew it i was back to smoking before everything. Long car ride? Better get high. Long day of work? A little wont hurt. After work, to my hearts content. I said i would quit again when the semester started. That did not happen. One bad day and i was at it again. It became a way to control my emotions. Never feeling the pain of a loss for too long. Never tracing the anger back to its source. Just being artificially happy. 

Well a couple years later and im back at the 90 days. I feel as good as i did the first time. I still think about smoking. I romanticize the habit. Luckily I learned from this group; I dont have to go forever without weed. Just today. Which oddly enough helps with the lows. For me it was always the lows that lead me to smoke. The lows are an important part of life. Its when you decide to make meaningful change. Its where you reflect on yourself and those around you. Dont deprive yourself of the lows in life.

I‚Äôm just over the month mark having quit smoking, somewhere I *never* thought I‚Äôd be. This post is just gonna be a few things I‚Äôve noticed and hopefully will help anyone struggling themselves to quit at the moment. 

So, a month clean... sounds crazy to me, however the mental and physical changes I‚Äôve noticed have been huge. I‚Äôm going to be honest, the first week was largely very easy, until days 5-7 of quitting. I‚Äôve posted about these days in particular previously so if you‚Äôre interested at all I went into a lot of detail, and those posts are on my profile. 

After these days, I had a week of real struggle, craving it a lot, and having it easily available through friends smoking, so it took a lot of will power to say no and to close myself off from it. I saw someone on here previously saying something along the lines of ‚Äòyou won‚Äôt feel better after smoking, but you‚Äôll feel amazing the morning after you didn‚Äôt‚Äô and this is SO true. Every morning I ticked off my calendar that I hadn‚Äôt smoked, I felt a real sense of achievement. And by this point I don‚Äôt even remember to tick it some days, it‚Äôs not even something I‚Äôd consider! 

The mental, emotional and physical effects were hard during these first two weeks, and continue to be hard sometimes now, but it is important to note that just because you have a hard day, this doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a *BAD* day - every time you feel like breaking down in tears, is a time your brain needs to get that out, but due to the effects of the weed it‚Äôs not been able to. The lack of proper REM sleep is so noticeable once you start getting good sleep and dreaming again! Honestly the amount I‚Äôve started being aware of my mental health and issues I haven‚Äôt wanted to confront is astounding - I‚Äôve learnt more about myself than I ever would‚Äôve though possible. 

I‚Äôve even stopped smoking cigarettes now, and that again is due to me stopping smoking cannabis, smoking a joint meant smoking a lot of tobacco, which was making it impossible to stop smoking fags - and OBVIOUSLY I feel a whole lot better physical health wise as a result. 

The two main things that have helped have been meditation and yoga (along with support from some very very good, supportive and trustworthy friends). If you‚Äôve ever considered yoga, meditation, or any other type of mindfulness, DO IT! Not able to post links on here, but if anyone wants any information or help getting into it, feel free to message me and I‚Äôll gladly give you some pointers to good instructors and guides online - I‚Äôm still only a beginner myself! 

My main advice is this: if you want to quit, for whatever reason - DO IT. If you really, truly want to quit, you will be able to. Put your mind to it, fuck what anyone else thinks about your decision, and do what‚Äôs best for you and your health, in turn you will feel so many positive changes and it‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre alive again.

What I‚Äôm trying to ask is, people who have addictive personalities, or people who have addiction problems running in their family ‚Äì what are some things you can do to help yourself from forming other addictions while you‚Äôre trying to quit another? My biggest fear with quitting weed isn‚Äôt the withdrawals or FOMO with my friends. I‚Äôm tired of waking up exhausted, barely remembering any details of the past year, feeling like I‚Äôm watching my life go by from the sidelines. 
But it‚Äôs the fear that I will climb out of one rabbit hole and land myself in another. That I will eventually try to use something else (like alcohol) as a crutch for my weed addiction, and then before I even realize it, it‚Äôs too late. 
Anyone have any advice?

I‚Äôm just looking for any advice I can get on helping me follow through with this. I‚Äôve been a daily smoker for the past 7 years, only stopping occasionally when I take a trip home for a week max. When I do travel home, I find it to be easier than I expected not to be high. I think it has to do with it not being around me, and being busy with family and friends. I will at some point always tell myself, ‚Äúwhen I get back, I‚Äôm going to keep this going and throw out my weed and devices‚Äù, however I always end up caving the day I get back. 

I haven‚Äôt been home with family in a while, and so I‚Äôve been trying to quit on my own now. Its been very hard to say the least. When I have weed at home and I‚Äôm trying not to smoke, i find myself getting anxious and depressed. I will walk in circles, feeling like I have something to do, when I should just be relaxing. I will always end up caving and smoke to make myself feel better. When I don‚Äôt have weed, I will tell myself this is my opportunity to stop. After feeling the previously mentioned feelings for a while, I will always end up texting my dealer to pick up to make myself feel better. 

I have a lovely girlfriend of 5 years, and she doesn‚Äôt care so much that I smoke, it actually affects me more than her. After a day of being constantly high, I will wake up feeling guilty that I was a lazy ass all day, and didn‚Äôt contribute to having a fun and eventful day with her. Plus I‚Äôll just smoke that next day. The only thing I can tell really bugs her is when I play video games all day or hardly do things with her cause I‚Äôm high. 

I work 7-3, and I never smoke before or during work. I hate being high at work. And I find it so weird I can be sober all day at work but right when I get home I feel like I need to smoke. Anyways, I feel like my overall physical and mental health has been really declining lately due to this constant battle of trying to get sober. I know it‚Äôs bad for me, but I just can‚Äôt get over the hump and stop. Any help or advice is welcome, and I‚Äôm sorry this is so long. Thanks!",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59576774}"

The only thing I could think about during the day was how much I just wanted to go home and get high. I have an anxious personality so I thought weed was helping me cope with it, but it honestly made everything worse.

My boyfriend lives out in Utah, I had a medical card for Florida so I was able to get pretty much as much as I wanted when I was in FL, but traveling is almost impossible and I felt like I needed to smoke all the time. 

Smoking was limiting my life. Even though I loved to travel and of course go to visit my boyfriend, I remember dreading it - or worse making plans to drive to CO just so I could get weed. I noticed I was just going home and smoking and passing out - sometimes I‚Äôd order food and forget, pass out, wake up the next morning and find ubereats at my doorstep. I lost interest in doing anything but watching tv and smoking. My house was a mess, I never had any motivation to go to the gym or even text a friend, and I was eating shit food all the time. I felt so terrible. I looked in the mirror and just saw an addiction.

It was time to stop. So I quit CT. I‚Äôve never felt so anxious in my life. I was vomiting, shaky, sweaty, agitated, couldn‚Äôt sleep for a week, but now - 9 days later things are starting to return to normal. I‚Äôm so happy. I‚Äôm doing the things I love, I‚Äôm calling and hanging out with friends and family members, I‚Äôm back at the gym and eating right. Life has so much more color now. I‚Äôve never realized how great a drug sobriety is and I can‚Äôt even imagine going back.

I knew deep in my heart the day I quit, that it was going to be about the hardest thing I‚Äôve done in my life. I took the big leap forward and with everyday day my power of will got extremely stronger, until the urge of quitting was more powerful then the urge to put myself in suspended animation. Let‚Äôs fast forward to now, I‚Äôm so much more comfortable and confident in my own skin, I‚Äôm happier then I was when I smoked, it‚Äôs a different happiness with less giggles an euphoria, however it has benefits of being proud of myself, loving myself for who I really am and really learning to accept all of my strengths and weaknesses! Some more highlight from quitting I feel less anxiety talking to people( even though the first 4 days of human interaction was tough) now I feel more able to carry on a conversation and put in my opinions without being scared of judgment! I feel more sure of myself now, like I can go and get an amazing career, I can go back to school and I can enjoy this life to the max, without feeling an urge to put myself in a reality where my problems vanish. I stopped procrastinating my life and started acting on it. The last 10 days iv solved more problems in my life then I have in a year of smoking! These small facts alone tell me, don‚Äôt look back, believe in yourself and love yourself for who you are.

Over the past year or so, I‚Äôve been saying that I‚Äôll quit or that I‚Äôd at least slow down(during the fall of 2020 I probably smoked 5-6 times a day) but I always end up rolling another one, or being involved with someone who smokes. Smoke to eat. Smoke before sex. Smoke to sleep. Smoke to fit in. I was also heavily involved in infused products, making them at home. That stuff is wayyyy stronger, as I‚Äôm sure many can tell you.

Yesterday was my 1st day of actually trying to quit. I was VERY tempted to end my night on a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù note. But I resisted.

I want to see where this takes me. I want to quit for a multitude of reasons: 
‚Ä¢Save money. I think if I calculated right, I spend close to $600/month, and that‚Äôs just basic smoking. It might not seem like a lot but imaging having kids and living paycheck to paycheck, but hey, at least I could smoke right? Wrong.
‚Ä¢My mental state. I dreamed last night. Very vividly. I don‚Äôt dream too often these days and I heard that when you DONT smoke you have dreams. It‚Äôs true. Believe me or not, but there was a time where I was having multiple premonition dreams(I‚Äôve managed to actually alter some of these scenarios, I wish I was bs when I say I‚Äôve seen my future multiple times), so I‚Äôm hoping maybe that could come back. I‚Äôve also heard that smoking throws off your chemical balance, making you more anxious or depressed or any mix of negative emotions. This I will have to find out for myself.

Idk how any of this works. I just wanted to ramble off some thoughts ig. I‚Äôve never used Reddit before, so is it coincidental that I happened to find this room at a pivotal time in my life?

// It‚Äôs been a daily thing for me. Morning, lunch breaks, in the car, all the time. I get sick & super anxious when on my last few grams with the thought of having to find more before I‚Äôm out. I‚Äôve had to fake drug tests for jobs. I don‚Äôt live a normal life to where I can just hang out with anyone, or go anywhere I want, bc I am trapped by addiction. For example- I can‚Äôt travel bc of the risk with bringing weed and the anxiety of not bringing it for just a few days is too much. I can‚Äôt just pick up my niece to go shopping bc I am afraid of influencing her (by accident) or bc my habits are obvious. I can‚Äôt hang for long periods of time with family or work/sober friends bc I just think about when I can get high. //

Anyway, I have had a string of emotional and mental issues since I started and nothing has helped. I took some Michigan diagnostic tests because I was being diagnosed as BPD or possible bi polar disorder and have had severe anxiety and depressions with some paranoid tendencies. 

The first time taking the tests , I scored off the charts and ‚Äúinconclusive‚Äù.  I answered everything honestly to how I felt. Well they made me take the tests again and I tried to be a little less extreme with my answers but still honest. 

She said my results were terrible and that they made me look like a crazy person but that I also indicated a drug problem. She told me the psychoactives do not do any help for my mind and that they have been hurting me and making me this emotional mess. She says I deserve better and all of this risky behavior is really just a lack judgement and mental capacity from being high all the damn time. I believe it. Lol but like not what I expected to hear. -_- I‚Äôm scared to stop

I Want to Quit for Good but I‚Äôm Scared I Don‚Äôt have the Strength.,"Long time lurker here. I‚Äôve basically been high everyday since I was about 16/17 and now that I‚Äôm 24 I‚Äôm starting to feel depressed with my lifestyle. I used to have friends that I would smoke with in addition to smoking alone. They got me into smoking back in high school and ever since I‚Äôve been smoking alone for the most part.

But I didn‚Äôt realize that smoking alone was slowly isolating me my from past friendships. I had hung out with a group of stoners for some time, but eventually they dispersed into two groups after high school. I hadn‚Äôt developed a personality then so I had trouble making new friends outside of my circle. This inevitably led to me feeling boring, often needing to be drunk or high to be fun enough around people.

The dangerous part was being alone on a Friday night and just accepting defeat by getting high. I knew I wasn‚Äôt as social as I had wanted to be, so I just gave up a lot of times and resorted to gaming alone in my room the whole night. At first this didn‚Äôt seem bad as I still maintained relationships with friends. But as time went on and people closed their circles, I found it harder and harder to be accepted anymore.

I had felt like I attached myself to weed so much that I didn‚Äôt have any social skills anymore. I spent so much time alone getting high that I would just not talk in groups. I believe this led people to think I was boring or weird because I never added to the conversation and I just was there to tag along. I never formed a personality so people just accepted me for the nice guy that I was.

I basically put myself in a toxic relationship because I was desperate for affection. I ended up with a girl that would‚Äôve normally been below my standards, but I was so beaten by society I fell in immediately. Of course my habit just got worse as I would smoke and drink more to cope with the relationship. At this point I realized weed alone wasn‚Äôt enough, I needed to be high and drunk at night to relax now. I would always make her mad because I‚Äôd leave her alone to go smoke in my room and now I feel bad about that. 

I blame college for getting me into alcohol addiction, because I used it to escape my weed addiction. I was tired of being the loner stoner, always smoking weed at parties and being boring. Alcohol was the opposite for me, it made me feel confident, happy, strong, all the things weed always took away from me. For once I felt like a confident person, but then my weed habits and alcohol habits combined. This happened because I found weed to be the best hangover treatment, so it was just a never ending cycle of being faded.


Anyways the relationship ended badly as she ditched me, which made me resort to using all my addictions much more. I stopped talking to friends and even started fights over texts with some of them for not being there for me. Eventually they all stopped talking to me. My ex wanted nothing to do with me anymore and my old friends had this negative perception of me or they just never cared for me to begin with. Especially after I got arrested, all my friends gossiped about it without ever asking me. So to this day I think they just spew these rumors about me.

Fast forward a year, I‚Äôm still a pothead alcoholic with a porn addiction. I‚Äôm so confused on how to start. But my bigger concern is that I don‚Äôt feel like I can make friends anymore. For whatever reason, I have this nagging feeling that each night I spend alone getting high and drunk, is another night that pushes me back. At the same time, I can‚Äôt bear the thought of spending a night alone without alcohol or weed. 

I almost need a substance at this point to help me forget about my shitty situation and weed is the safest. I feel suicidal at times when it‚Äôs the weekend and I haven‚Äôt reached out to anyone. I feel like life is leaving me behind and soon I won‚Äôt have anyone to talk to, so I‚Äôll just end up drinking and smoking till death. But I want to be optimistic, I just haven‚Äôt seen many promising signs. I also fight a lot with my family so substances are how I usually calm myself down.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76462525}"

(wall of text),"well, the title says it all. i'm a 23 yo male, and i've been smoking on and off since i was 15 (tried weed first when i was 11, grew up in a region famous for its naturally growing and rather potent shit), and have been smoking for almost 4 years straight, with small breaks. 

i live in russia, where it is both expensive and extremely dangerous to consume marijuana - yet i managed to score everyday. got into countless troubles with police and the actual logistics of buying it in an illegal AF country (dead drop system), wasted thousands of dollars worth of my parents' and then my own money. 
won't go into much detail as to why, lest this thing turns into a gargantuan piece of my whining, but still want to share several things.

firstly, what made me finally say ""fuck it"" was not something discrete. it was the result of years of miserable existence in brainlet mode, self-destruction and devaluation and shaming, and, finally, the financial factor. i understood that in order to be able to focus on my family - i'm from a... let's say communitarian minority ethnicity, where families are huge, very close and extremely important - i had to drop the habit. well, the realisation wasn't enough. i tried several dozen times, with sound and not very much so methods. 
nothing worked; i've always found new workarounds, new excuses, new reasons to fuck it up with another ""vodnik"". it went so far as to me smoking in my own room, in a house full of children and relatives, every night whilst listening to every sound outside my door like a scared animal. 

then, during one of the comedowns when i tried to communicate with my family, my mother brought up a memey childhood memory that i was supposed to remember, and did so pretty much forever. except now i didn't. it hit me like a fucking fire truck. i can't remember the dearest things - my amazing childhood, last time i was truly happy and carefree, the games we used to play, the village that i grew up in, the smells and so on, you know the deal. i forgot what were my parents like when they were young, the stuff we used to do together and the accompanying emotions felt artificial, numbed, like those of a different man, a hero of an enjoyable, yet painful-to-read novel.

i have realised that i will forget my life. that i will always be in my own little bubble - never truly happy, amused, saddened or angry - just contentish. 
it just so happened that i was about to catch a flight to my home republic - i live in the capital now, but frequent home every so often to see the remaining relatives and friends. those were always windows of opportunity for the later me; i have, at one point of time, decided to never, ever touch weed while i was home. i have no idea why, or when it happened, but it was pretty much my only life jacket; i adhered by this principle without a single failure. being home, among people of your mentality, with amazing nature around you and the freshest air on the planet earth helped not smoking a lot. besides, i always have shit to do back there.

anyways. that evening i called my plug, got a ""goodbye"" half g of homemade hash and smoked myself to sleep. when i woke up for my plane i realised that i had to finish my supply, so i rolled a fattie. and then i had some problems with it not burning evenly, as hash Js were tricky to execute sometimes, when i suddenly became fucking furious. i am a very volatile man, so i threw the j on the floor, danced a little Simd on its corpse and angrily went to get a cab and flew home, where i kept extremely busy for 5 days.
the moment i threw the joint i was enraged, but for the first time i wasn't angry at myself or any other self or thing - i was angry at weed. that stupid motherfucker decided to play one last trick on me. i was extremely offended by such behaviour, and ""pinned"" that emotion. and you know what? it fucking worked. 

i have returned back to moscow, a city i loathe full of people i dont understand who in turn understand me even less. yet i finally feel strength, although i feel like it comes from my worst trait - the ever-consuming and ever-brewing anger inside. anger at weed (and, truth be told, at myself as well) for making me forget my life, for wasting my youth and crippling me mentally, and i feel hints of something that i completely forgot exists in me: confidence.
true, i have been not okay emotionally for the past week. it's been extremely tough as all of the thoughts and fears that i have suppressed for years have returned, ten times stronger than before. yet i am still standing, and nowhere near calling my plug or going over to a stoner friend. 

yet i cannot, for the love of God, fall asleep before 5 in the morning. i am strongly against taking sleep medications as it reminds me of a similar ""just-to-help-me-go-to-sleep"" cycle. i exercise a lot, walk a lot, and work a lot. yet i am typing this at 5:16, with ""not a hint of sleep in one's eyes"", as they say in soviet russia. will the insomnia, or whatever, finally end? how do i normalise my sleep schedule? 

shit, this turned out to be an essay.. congrats if you've reached this far, i guess.hope it at least reads well. but i probably needed to share this with somebody, and also provide an additional stimuli to keep me going, as it would be plain shameful to write such a long drywall of text for nothing.

Don‚Äôt know exactly what it‚Äôll be like, certainly can guess, but I‚Äôve decided to frame it in a way that sparks my curiosity. Make it adventurous. 

What to do when bored? How to have fun when sober? Is it okay to be silly and childish? Is it okay to be lazy? Is it okay to talk in weird voices? Is it okay to watch terrible movies and like them!? Is it okay not to care what other people think?! Is okay to do something that makes me look stupid!? Is it okay to not take life too seriously and laugh at myself?

Here‚Äôs to the journey! It may last 1 year, 5 years, or forever! But I am sure as hell gonna experience it and LIVE it. The ups, the downs, the sideways, and the upside downs. Gonna try to conquer the journey just like I tried to conquer the previous journey. If you don‚Äôt remember what the journey is...go back to the beginning of the post.

Ive been smoking weed consistantly for 15yrs (since 16, am now 31). I used to smoke for alot of different reasons. I could hangout with friends and chill or if i haven't eaten all day i could use it as an appetite booster or if i was in a bad mood about something i could smoke a bowl and just forget about it. Lately, it has not had the same effect as it had before (probably the last year or so). I find myself being angry at everything and as someone who is bi-polar this isnt good at all for my mental health.

But today something changed.
**I ran out of weed** but I had some res from the neck of the bowl

As I'm about to take a hit of this disgusting mess, it hit me.

**Wtf am I doing? I look like junkie trying to get his last fix.**

I feel i have hit my bottom.

So today is day 0.

My only time i quit was when i was 19 for 6 months cause i was arrested for possession and i was on a supervised probation. 

I'm not sure i know where to start. I've becoming very hostile and reclusive because of everything mentioned. I hate myself and i just want to go back to me, before i started smoking.

In my last post, about a week ago, I was incredibly depressed and anxious. It was unbearable. I felt worthless, and couldn‚Äôt manage my recurring catastrophic thoughts- thinking I was permanently brain damaged and broken. Thinking that I will get so depressed and anxious that I will lose my job and become homeless.

These days, I try and tell myself that I will eventually return to feeling good about myself, and that I just have to be patient. I mean, if I was truly permanently damaged then I probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to feel good while being high before quitting, right? At least, that‚Äôs what kind of gives me hope that I can get my groove back.

Before today, for a good 4-5 days I felt a little less anxious and depressed. Although I didn‚Äôt feel too great. But this morning, my catastrophic thoughts came back. I‚Äôve been anxious all day. I still can‚Äôt find joy in small things like I used to. I haven‚Äôt had a good laugh in such a long time, since being high.

I walked a few miles, prayed a lot, drank a lot of water, read a little bit, and took an afternoon nap. I feel a bit better now.

I‚Äôve been reading a lot of posts here from people that, like me, are still having a hard time months after quitting. And seeing all the responses from people who have come out of the darkness gives me a lot of hope. Thank you everyone for sharing your stories. And thank you for reading mine.

I carried on smoking during this time because, as I'm sure we all understand, addiction is a bitch, but I'm just looking for a light at the end of the tunnel. If I'm in this for the long haul then no doubt it's a product of my own substance abuse but it would be nice to know that in time I'd be able to live as if nothing ever happened.

I'm starting my third week sober today, and while my body and brain are adjusting to this new, better, reality, I figured I'd write down the changes that I noticed are happening to me while they're fresh.

I find that I'm more ""present"" for everything. Enjoyable things are much more enjoyable.

It's much easier to put effort into activities. I no longer resent working hard.

Sex is much more pleasurable. I finish more quickly, but that can be easily remedied with a little creativity.

Daily exercise seems like an attainable goal. The chronic lung inflammation from weed could get me to be a real lazy POS. Now, I don't dread workouts as much, and I'm better at pushing myself after I've begun.

I can dream again! Admittedly, it's more difficult to actually get to sleep than it used to be, but the sleep comes with dreams! Sometimes excellent, sometimes terrifying, but I'm aware of my dreaming in a way that I never was when I'd fall asleep high.

My future ambitions seem less daunting. I'm graduating college soon, and my first time trying in an earnest effort into finding a job happened after I quit. I'm actually hopefully now that I'll start a job in my field soon after I graduate.

While this isn't necessarily something that I noticed on my own, my therapist has mentioned that I'm much more articulate and energetic since quitting.

It's not all good. I've noticed that being sleep deprived takes a much bigger toll on me than it used to. It's also harder to start tasks that I find mundane and stupid.

I have Seasonal Affective Disorder, so I've always hated this time of year, but for the first time in my life, February seems awesome! Quitting smoking has more than made up for the gloom of winter.

I have been lurking in the /r/leaves community for a while now. All the motivation from fellow leavers has made me realise it is possible to change my daily habit. And today is the first step in the right direction. 

Don't get me wrong, I have tried many times to quit smoking, never with great success. To give a little background, I started smoking when I was 16, started daily smoking around 17. Parents are both addicted to certain substances, so I might have a bit of an addictive personality. However, this should never be an excuse to not quit.

People usually take the route that is most likely to fail, people always manage to create excuses for not wanting to quit. ""I'll just smoke one more before I go to sleep"" or ""Just a small joint won't do any harm"".

Well, not today, I'm done with that attitude. After smoking 3 joints a day for almost 6 years, I'm done. No more excuses, no more empty bank accounts, no more meeting dealers in shady places, no more harm to my lungs. 

I know it won't be easy, especially now that corona is happening. I'm inside all day without anything to keep me busy or anyone to keep me company. On the other hand, not being able to smoke weed with friends is a big reason why quitting now is the perfect moment. 

For everyone thinking this is a post on a whim, ""tomorrow he is smoking again."" I already quit yesterday, I could barely sleep all night and have had cravings the entire day. Even while writing the post I'm this close to saying fuck it and buying some weed. However, not today.. today is different. 

 I want to be able to have feelings  again, I want to be able to breath normally again, I want my lung  capacity back, I want to start working out, I want to have more free  time (rolling and smoking honestly take more time than you sometimes realise), I want to be able to be productive again, I want to remember what people said to me, I want to remember details about peoples' lives again. I remember when I was younger, like 14ish I was able to remember close to every important detail some person told me about themselves, that skillset is long gone by now, but maybe by quitting, I'll at least be interested in other people again, be able to pick up some hobbies that make me a more interesting person. Sorry for this long rant, but I'm writing down all the reasons why I want to quit, so I can remind myself to keep going.

Honestly, life has been lonely, my girlfriend left me, lockdown is happening, I haven't seen friends in about a year. I play games all day and is very non productive. I WANT TO CHANGE.

If you have read this entire post, thank you. The last thing I want to mention is that it will be very hard for me to quit, especially as I'm doing it all alone. So if you are in the same boat as me, or maybe you have quit already and are able to provide a helping hand, please don't be afraid to reach out, I could definitely enjoy some company on my journey.",2,"{'rona': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.42448202}"

Some history is I've been smoking pot on and off since I have been 16. I've tried to quit several times with a year or two sober max. But today I begin to try to take my life back. 


I want to stay sober and I haven't really tried 100% in probably 5 or so years. 

I've quit pot like I said several times and this most recent time I started up last May after a few months clean from weed.
 I started buying vape cartridges like TKO and have been using those only since May of last year. 

Anyway I just want to try to do something different this time by actually declaring what I did today and Just try to stay sober with. I just want this to stick. I've done this many times so I am familiar with the pink cloud and triggers but I'm not good about opening up to people. I need any help or advice that is given.

I am leaving my workplace. There are many reasons, but one big one is my manager is always high and is not able to keep up with the expectations of the job because of it.  She will show up and tell us how she ripped her bong so hard and doesn't think she can function, etc. 

The other issues have been related to respecting my limits. I am a 10 year massage therapist. I haven't lasted this long by overworking myself. When I ask for healthy limits for myself, they do not comply. They lie to clients. Instead of fixing recurring problems, they just give away free services to calm upset clients. It isn't *my* business, but I feel like I am forced to violate not only my physical limits but also my ethical boundaries. 

But- I love the clients. I signed a noncompete. I am touching these people's lives and for that I don't want  to leave. I am feeling so anxious.

I haven‚Äôt done an actual 12 step program but knew/know I‚Äôm not capable of being responsible with my use. How I fell back into it makes me so mad at myself. It‚Äôs been about a month as a chronic again and I‚Äôm watching my mental health and relationship circle the drain.

My boyfriend and I met when I was clean and I had told him what a problem weed used to be for me. We‚Äôve been seeing each other for about a year now and I just moved into his place. Until I started smoking again he told me he was glad he met me after I quit and that he wouldn‚Äôt want a partner like I described myself as a smoker. Now that I‚Äôm smoking again, he‚Äôs super passive about it, even when I try to express to him how important it is for me to quit. He says he‚Äôs ok with it because he doesn‚Äôt think I smoke not to get high. I‚Äôm not sure where this inconsistency comes from and am frustrated that I feel like I don‚Äôt have his support but realistically he doesn‚Äôt know how to support me... I also know one of the first things I loose as a weed smoker is my ability to communicate my feelings and needs. He‚Äôs tried to support me by justifying my smoking, which is the total opposite of what I need right now. That said I know as a chronic I am not able to contribute what‚Äôs required to sustain a healthy relationship, so us having a chance does depend on me quitting.

I know it probably sounds like I‚Äôm doing this for the relationship. I‚Äôm definitely not. I‚Äôm not even totally sure this relationship is the one for me, but I know that‚Äôs not a decision I‚Äôm in a position to be making until my head is clearer. I need to be sober again so I have some power over my own life and emotions and can make decisions like this before they are made for me.

The problem is that weed allows way too much time to pass. What was always meant to just be a Sunday night event turned into a Monday morning, midday, evening habit. Weed caused me to lose hours, days, whole weekends and even weeks. So yes, while it would be so nice to be high right now, the reality is that I would lose my life as a result. For me, picking up one joint leads to a lifestyle of getting high 24/7. If I got high tonight, eventually I‚Äôd stop cleaning my apartment or doing laundry. I‚Äôd slack at work and school, which would probably cost me my degree. I‚Äôd lose friendships because suddenly I wouldn‚Äôt be present for anyone. My life would turn into a mess.

Sober life isn't all that bad, it's actually quite amazing being able to think straight and pursue my hobbies instead of monging out to YouTube!

Cannot wait for lockdown to be over to hit gym again, this time adding some cardio into my workouts alongside lifting to help my lungs improve.

I feel reborn! If you're struggling to quit try going to an Marijuana anonymous meeting! It really helped me just get the ball rolling. Ive still got my remaining weed in a drawer in my house, and i drank a few nights this past month and I always loved to smoke and drink at the same time, however I did not cave whatsoever! I didn't even think about smoking! Ok maybe once haha but I immediately told myself it would cause more harm than good and that it would be a silly thing to do. Even in a recent dream someone passed me a joint and I was like yeet I don't need this

I no longer feel as turbulent. I no longer have volatile, defeatist emotions where I can go from being content to being suicidally depressed in the space of 5 minutes. I am much more emotionally stable and I love it!

Therapy, meditation, and a new mindset were my pillars to getting through this month.

Thought I should check in now that I‚Äôve been weed free for 11 weeks. This change has had an incredible impact on my life, a change which for so long I doubted would make any difference in my mental health and which I actively avoided for years. Since my first puff as a teenager, I I struggled with anxiety, depression, and low self esteem. I used this leafy substance as a ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù, using whenever I was stressed, sad, tired, and every other feeling in between. It became a bad habit that not only emptied my bank account but also made me feel even more anxious, unmotivated and miserable. 

Quitting was not easy for the first few months, however, the past few weeks have been the happiest times I can remember having in a very long time. Everyday, I wake up before the sun does to exercise, do chores and plan out what my next exciting adventures will be. I enjoying socializing more and even finally got in contact with a crush I‚Äôve always been too afraid to talk to. I still have my struggles, but they are less scary and easier to tackle now that I have a clear head.

I've been a day to day smoker for almost 4 years now, and at my peak, I was smoking a half-gram cart in 2-3 days. I had an experience last week that made me feel like enough is enough. The withdrawal symptoms have been very rough, anxiety has been through the roof, non-stop cold sweating on my palms and feet, and intense mood swings to the point where I cry.

I started using weed more regularly around the time I started University, it helped me deal with the loneliness of not being around friends I've been close with since elementary, but as I started smoking more often I started realizing that it was holding me back and increasing the distance between me and my friends. I've also noticed that smoking is negatively impacting my general anxiety disorder.

Edit: Someone wanted to know how this change has affected me.

I'm a lot less angry, crabby, or explosive with people. I'm less stingy, too. I have more time to do the things I enjoy, like cooking, and I started teaching myself guitar. It's easier to focus and the craving for bud is pretty much gone when it isnt in my face. The highs arent as high (duh) but the lows arent NEARLY as low, and theres no more tweaking. Almost all of my anxiety and nausea is gone, aside from basic test anxiety (university woes), which is a huge plus. I'm finding more joy in the actual activities rather than being high while I do them, which is big. My cognition still feels a bit impaired from all of my smoking back then, but my grades have been really damn good so definitely improvement, and my priorities have improved, too. Still, I think I'll always miss weed; there were some great memories. It's like an abusive ex, though. I miss the good days, but there were just too many bad ones, and I feel like I've healed now. Still a lot of growth in my future, but whether or not I smoke is still 100% in my control, and that feels good.

I was a very heavy user for YEARS, i'm now 30 days sober and I've never felt better. Still super early but this time feels so much different to all the other attempts, if I can get this far so can you!

Don't give up you can do it! Cravings last between 3-5 mins on average, so if you feel the cravings kick in distract yourself for 5-10 mins and it will pass.

And stay busy! It may be hard at first and you don't need to be busy 24/7 but the more time that you occupy yourself the less time you'll be thinking about weed.

Scary stuff.

**Please remember to sort /r/leaves by new and look for posts with low participation.  Nobody likes to feel like they are unheard.  It feels great to give back to the community.**

I often say positive momentum because for me that's what it's all about... once you are past that brutal first week or so.

Today is a milestone for me. To celebrate, allow me to spam my list of tips again in the spirit of general visibility.




***This is what got me away from it:***

* First step: Make a list of things I hate about being a stoner. Keep that list handy and refer back whenever tempted. Add to the list anytime you think of more negative things.  This is the list of things you have to accept in your life if you want to keep using. 
* It's very important to fall out of love with weed. She is a physically and mentally abusive ex. Some people like to give him/her a name. Maybe just Mary Jane
* Daily journaling about how things are going with the quit. Getting circular thoughts out of your head takes a big weight off. Get things out of your brain (ram) and onto a journal (storage). This could be on paper or in a journal on your phone/laptop
* Start a calendar with X on each day of the quit. Or use an app that counts days sober
* Spending time here on /r/leaves and sorting by new. Reading and participating helps a lot. This is one of the biggest differences between these and all my previous unsupported quit attempts over the years. Helping others with similar issues is a great way to stay on track. Look into the subject of service and recovery
* Make a list of things that have improved since I quit. Once you start to see real improvement a couple weeks in, write those things out and keep it handy. The positives on that list will be stuck in your mind if you ever relapse. This list of how much better/easier life is without weed will be very effective in ruining the high. If you want to get high again, you have to give up this list. There are a lot of positives once you get going, so it's a lot to give up. Keep adding to the list along the way as you notice new positives
* Stay busy with hobbies, interests, volunteering, projects, cleaning, organizing, walks, travel, daytrips, etc. This is really important. You need to dig deep and brainstorm a huge list of random stuff you are interested in. Variety is key. 
* Volunteering can be a great way to meet new people outside of the old stoner friends group. As a side benefit it helps distract from yourself and takes up idle time. 
* Watch out for replacement habits. Increased drinking, other drugs, shopping, eating, internet/social media. Your subconscious will be trying to get dopamine hits however it can. It's important to track and observe these things so they don't get out of hand. 


***The first couple of weeks of acute withdrawal issues are tough. Here are a few tips.***

* If possible, don't attempt to do anything too complicated or frustrating. You will get short tempered and want to run back to weed for comfort.
* Watch familiar and lighthearted tv shows or movies (for example The Office, Seinfeld reruns, bloopers, etc) If what you are watching is too challenging or complicated, it might peak anxious feelings and make you want to use weed to cope.
* Avoid too much random internet and social media. Your brain will spin and you will feel exhausted from the dopamine rushes. Look into social media addiction. Check out /r/nosurf
* Find something easygoing to do like coloring, sketching, whittling, cleaning a room, organizing, guitar, etc. Creating something helps release dopamine in a healthy way. Little wins help a lot.
* Have some easy foods ready like after a sickness or surgery. Yogurt, jello, buttered noodles, saltines, mashed potatoes, rice, etc. Have some antacids or pepto handy too.
* Stay hydrated.  Emergen-c has electrolytes and can be a nice alternative to water.  Soda water like LaCroix can be very refreshing and help break up unusual throat feelings that come with quitting.
* You might get stress and tension headaches.  Be ready with some Tylenol and ibuprofen. Yoga for headaches can be found on YouTube. Fresh air can help too.
* Go on long walks or bike rides with a podcast. It will ease anxiety and help wear your body down for better rest at night. It also counts as exercise if the idea of the gym or running is too much. 
* Listen to interesting podcasts or ebooks. They will distract you from yourself and help keep your circling thoughts at bay. Combine this with a long walk or bike ride.
* Yoga/stretching. Check YouTube for yoga with Adrienne for anxiety, stress, and headaches
* Don't be too hard on yourself for losing patience and temper. Just try and catch yourself before hurting friends and family. Journaling about when these things happen can help you find patterns and give you more control
* Expect intense, exhausting, and confusing dreams. Seriously disturbing stuff based on your deepest worries, fears, and secrets. I have experienced these many months into my quits
* Try not to make any big dramatic decisions (breaking up, quitting jobs, buying cars, etc) until the dust settles on your quit. Sleep on any big decisions changes if possible until a few weeks or months after quitting.
* If you start thinking if a bunch of overwhelming stuff you need to do, just put it all in a list.  This avoids worrying about all of it in a circular pattern. Look into the Getting Things Done concept from David Allen. The mind is great at thinking of things, but not so great with storage and recall.
* Expect anxiety attacks and don't give them too much power.  It's just the addiction monkey thrashing as you hold it's head under the water.  Anxiety attacks should start to settle a month or so in. But then again, sometimes they come from real problems you have to face with a sober reality. Those problems will not fix themselves by quitting weed, so this anxiety could be with you for a while
* Be prepared for sleep issues.  For me it's waking up way too early.  A few weeks in, my sleep was much improved and I feel i am getting better rest than I have in years.  But sometimes I still wake up way too early. But hey, bright side that's more time in the day.
* Some people get a lot of night sweats.  If possible keep the bedroom really cool and run a dehumidifier to keep the air dry.",30,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.45831677}"

I'm 32 years old today. I started drinking and smoking weed when I was 15. I quit drinking last July, and I quit smoking 3 weeks ago. My son is just over a year old. If I could describe my life in one word: difficult.

I used drugs and alcohol to escape reality for almost 17 years. I just never felt like I ""belonged"", and drugs made that feeling go away. Then I became a father, and now I'm slowly being forced to confront all the skeletons in the closet that I've been ignoring for so long. And it's hard. Like, really hard. And I'm exhausted all the time.

But you know what? Fuck it. 17 years of jerking off and coasting is bound to come with its hardships. I'm confident that things will actually get better. I applied to go back to school in the fall (electrical technology) so that I can improve my life and my family's life. I'm sure that if I channel the same amount of time and energy towards school/bettering myself as I did towards getting drunk and stoned, then things should turn out just fine.

So, what am I going to do today? I'm gonna do some chores, because that's what makes me feel good. I'm gonna do some exercise. I'm gonna make some tea. Maybe I'll order some takeout since it's my birthday... we'll see. But my family comes first now. I just wanna do the best I can for them.

You know,  I LOVE smoking pot.
But i just can't handle it. I'm a slave for it. I'll never be able to manage moderate consume. I tried it. I quit for 100 days few years ago to challenge myself and I felt so GOOD. I was even strong enough to be around people who smoked and also rolled joints at parties without lighting them myself. I was so proud and oh, so naive when thinking 'See? You don't NEED it. You can handle moderate consume now' 
I was so wrong. Worked out for a few days and then it turned into daily usage again, worse than before. 

I don't know what my exact goal is this time. When I think about quitting forever,  I could start to cry.

I eventually got in trouble with the law and got a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù, so I quit smoking weed, and alcohol found it‚Äôs place. It took many years, but alcohol was my new weed - I was drinking pretty much all day everyday but it‚Äôs affect on my life and health was a lot more dramatic. So after years of struggling, I quit drinking and found out how great life is sober. It was like I had woken up, and that the world was my oyster and I could do anything. 

A couple months into my sobriety I randomly went to a marijuana dispensary with a friend and just got a couple things for the novelty. I got a disposable vape pen that I‚Äôd sometimes smoke at night, and some flower that sat in my drawer for a couple months. Eventually that vape pen ran out, so I tapped into the flower and only got high occasionally using a little one hitter. Then I went back to the dispensary and bought a lot more. Eventually bought a small bong, then a bowl, then more vapes. What was just at night on a blue moon became every night, then immediately after work, then all day everyday.

I felt that because it just chilled me out, it was OK. It certainly wasn‚Äôt alcohol, I wasn‚Äôt doing serious damage to my health, it slows my mind down, and I don‚Äôt have hangovers - so what‚Äôs the problem? Because it‚Äôs a crutch that I shouldn‚Äôt have. I went months after drinking where I had so much motivation and was embarking on on a major self improvement journey... but now, I just want to be at home playing video games and laying on the couch. I don‚Äôt think there is anything inherently wrong with that, but I know that I‚Äôm using weed exactly like I was with alcohol - I want to shut my mind off and escape from reality, all the time, and I know that‚Äôs not OK for me. 

Weed is a lesser evil than alcohol or other drugs - but it‚Äôs still a mind altering substance that can be abused for self medication, and that‚Äôs unfortunately the only way I‚Äôve known how to use it.

For those of you that don‚Äôt want to do the math I am 5 hours shy of my 5th day not smoking any weed. If I would have slept 8 hours a night, that is 75 hours I have been awake, however iv only been sleeping roughly 4 hours every night so that adds up to about 90 hours iv been awake the last 5 days. Not an hour has gone by I don‚Äôt think about my old beloved drug, but my power of will has grow significantly. I will now get to the reason of my post. 

Today was probably the worst day of my life at least the worst day I can remember. It start off half way into my 8 hour shift at fire house subs. See, Iv had lower back issues the past two year and after a few doctor appointments, chiropractic adjustment, and even physical therapy nothing had helped me. I made a decision to go back to the doctor and push for x-rays. Well, I got my x-rays back and hearing the results on the phone(during my 30 min break)They told me something along the lines of.. I have a degenerative back disorder called  retrolisthesis that involved my s1 and s5 disk. I had no idea what any of this meant. Shortly after a few google searches I found my answer. It‚Äôs basically an injury that is un cure-able and mostly people are prescribed muscles relaxers, and injection of steroids in the lower back and in cases that neither of those help, surgery. I‚Äôve lived every day the last 2 years in pain. The best way to describe it is I feel a sharp pain about 3- 4 hours a day that feels like a knife is being inserted into my lower back on my right side, the time the pain is manageable it feel more like a dull pain that is just annoying. I feel back pain every step I take, every time I stand longer then 5 min, any time I sit in a chair over 30 min (including driving), whenever I bend over or squat, even at times while laying down. Sitting in my car reading that I will live the rest of my life with lower back pain that even surgery and drugs won‚Äôt be able to take care of, I cried. (Btw I‚Äôm 21 years old the age of invincibility some say) But I had to get back to work and put my best smile on.( and I did )
I think in my brain iv know for a long time my back was never going to get better, but having the facts in front of my face was like being slapped in the face with ice water and metal hand. It hurt and I was shocked, sad and angry, plus not smoking weed made emotions pour out of me in 10 fold. Work wasn‚Äôt horrible neither was my day. But the realization of my back was enough to wipe every happy thought from my brain and make my day a living hell. 
I‚Äôm a great actor, could probably play in movie I‚Äôd say. None of my coworkers asked me what was wrong and I had cheery voice every time I talked to a customer. But behind that face showed the shadow of so many bad thoughts in my head.  Well the orthopedic doctor will call me next week for my first visit and hopefully what they do can help some of my pain. A lot of the time I smoked weed to forget about the pain but now I may be prescribe pain killers which I will not take under any circumstance. I have far to addicted of a personality to start talking those kind of pills. I will not smoke weed agin for the rest of my life I don‚Äôt care if it helps my pain, I feel like unemotional zombie that cares about little to nothing besides my own pleasure. I know that sounds sick but that is the person I am being addicted to weed. In these last 5 days iv experienced more emotion then iv felt in what feels like months( not good emotions) but emotions all the same and I missed them like I miss my half sister I haven‚Äôt seen in close to 8 years. I know I‚Äôm metamorphosing into the happy fun loving polite person I was before I smoked weed, and I won‚Äôt quit, it just hurts to know it will never be gone. 
I‚Äôm sorry this post is so long and sorry some of it is a little off topic for the group all the same if you had made it to the end of this please share your thoughts I would love it and it helps me stay sober. 
So much love I can‚Äôt even put in words for you beautiful people.

Sharing my first step. 26 years daily,"What is the ambivalence? I may be 99% of the way there right now, but there's still about 1% of me that says it would still be good to continue smoking. I don't want to deal with emotional withdrawals, don't want be bored, I want enhance my game playing... But lets get me 100% on board with whatever I want to do. If it's life without weed that we want, lets remove the obstacles. Identify the obstacles, then remove them.  

Lets find creative ways to overcome the obstacles. 

Inventory of my emotions, every 3 hours? Am I sober? Am I irritable? Am I bored? How was playing my games - Did I need weed to enjoy it or was it ok as is?

Emotional regulation. Emotions take the form of a wave. They always build up, start low, we think about something, it builds, it crests, and goes back down over time. Every. Single. Emotion. Every. Time. Good or bad. Sometimes they crest at real high levels, pure fury, 10/10 anger, even that eventually subsides and goes back down. Scale your emotions. I'm bored - how bored am I? 7/10? Can I deal with that? Is there something I can do to bring myself to help ride that wave of emotion? Sometimes time is all you need. Maybe it's some activity to do to cope. Maybe I say I wake up and am irritable, not gonna be able to ride this down, I need a coping skill that doesn't involve a substance I don't want to use anymore. Even if it's first thing in the morning, lets plan it out now so we are ready when the time comes.

Just thinking about quitting is more anxiety, and I‚Äôm adding that stress to my life everyday now, not good, got to fix that right away. Better to take that energy thinking about quitting, and focus on the feeling. Ask myself, how does this feel in my body? Where do I feel it? What is it like right now in this very moment? Take note, dive in. Allow myself to feel this feeling. And that is what will allow this feeling to pass. And it will pass.

Quitting old habits is hard because it's attached to who I used to be. Letting go of that past part of me and saying I don't need it anymore, it's not who I am anymore. That is the source of the challenge.

The emotions are going to be provoked. Perhaps that‚Äôs not a bad thing. Perhaps they need to be provoked in order to explore them, in order to move on. Lets take the negative and turn it to a positive. What can we learn from these experiences?

Is it Ok to experience boredom sometimes? We can experience boredom and still be ok. We can experience irritability and shame and guilt and we can be ok with that, because that‚Äôs a natural human experience. The important thing is that we can focus on a loving-nurturing approach of interest and exploration, from there we couldn't even beat ourselves up about it if we tried. And that will help us heal and move forward.

Are there new ways to cope with boredom? New ways to bring interesting things into my life? They are all sitting right there. I could learn Spanish. I could learn piano. I could mix up my exercise or foods, shows or games, books, anything. Bob Ross style painting. I can dive into anything, and I can do it all without weed.

What‚Äôs clear is I need something new to do, or to enhance things I'm doing now, that I can enjoy without weed.

I‚Äôm going to make a list of all of the times I need to smoke weed. Then I‚Äôm going to work on unpairing those things. Specifically. Individually. I'm going to make notes and pore over them. Its going to be an honor to give myself this time and attention, and I'm proud of myself and happy with myself for this as well.

I need to give myself a couple hours to play games sober and also focus on what it feels like to not have the weed in my system. Ask myself: is this boring, did I get irritated, distracted, what was my focus like? Understand those experiences that I would normally pair with weed and see how life is different without weed. See that difference, and accept that change in perception to the pure and simple, raw unfiltered reality that I am pining for. 

My stash. Is it worth that much just because I paid that much? How does value change, and how do we hold onto the idea of value? Real value is only determined by markets. And just because I bought something doesn't mean I have to use it. I once traded away hundreds of CDs full of music that I paid a fortune for in the 90s, just to get a tiny fraction of it back. Today they would be just trash. No, my stash has lost all it's personal value to me. Today I am throwing it away. Trash pickup is tomorrow morning. All my glass, vaporizers, weed, everything. Going away today. No goodbye, just good riddance. I don't need you anymore. 

Here's an additional incentive: something useful to develop would be to look back and see how much I've spent monthly, and throw 80% of that into an account or something. Something to look forward to. Might not even need to know what it is just yet. Just something to be proud of for each week of sobriety.

Therapy. This also helped. I found an amazing therapist on Betterhelp (wasn't that expensive) and we've been meeting every week.

Meditation

Journaling

Exercise

The first month was hard. Lots of anxiety, irritability, sadness. I still have cravings but not nearly as much. I'm noticing a lot of positive changes in my life and no matter how tempted I am, I know I cannot and will not go back. MAny ca have casual relationships with weed, but I cannot unfortunately and it's not worth getting sucked back in to daily non-stop smoking.

I've been actively trying to quit smoking weed for the last 5 years with varying degrees of success. Here is my [first post on Leaves](https://old.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3c0zs3/stopped_smoking_on_421_relapsed_yesterday/) in which I began my journey, and my na√Øve post later that year declaring I wasn't [smoking no' mo'.](https://old.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3uaqfy/my_mind_is_finally_clear/)   

[This post] (https://old.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lbvej6/dont_even_think_about_moderation/) has inspired me to fully commit. There is no such thing as moderation if you are lurking this sub. You know you have a problem with weed, otherwise you would not be here! You might even be thinking you can smoke in moderation, but let me tell you there is absolutely no such thing as smoking in moderation. At least, not for us.

The short version of my 5 year quitting journey is the max length of time I reach without any THC is always 6 months. It didn't matter how good or bad I was doing in life, it was always 6 months. Perhaps I felt I had hit a mile stone, or I deserved 1 high for the day. In the beginning after a relapse, I would go on 2 month binges, which reduced to 1 month binges, and then binges that were about 1-3 weeks long.

I think I told myself, ""Hey, I went 6 months without getting high so just this one time will be a-OK!"" But it **always** led to more sessions. The mental gymnastics I do is usually the same too. 
Smoke that **1 time** with friends/family, afterwards rationalize it would be alright to get high on weekends, justify that if I can handle weekends again I can handle week nights after all work and responsibilities are done. 

You know where this leads! Back to waking and baking!! High 24/7!! This of course leads to me neglecting my health and responsibilities.

I'm getting off a two week cart binge from 2 days ago, and I still feel slow and lethargic. I was going to do giant detailed post of my journey, but I am suffering hard from insomnia. I want to sleep but cant lol

If anyone has any questions about the process of quitting and what you might experience don't hesitate to ask. Reminder that:

That's wrong. Mary hurts. She hurts you so that you end up hurting all those around you who care for you and love you. She hurts you so much that others can't bare to see it happen before them and they leave. 

Not because I am a bad person. But because They couldn't deal with the person I am when we are together. 

I deserve more then this. I deserve real love and affection from another human being! 

I concede way to much of my power to you. You make me sleepy and tired and unmotivated.

I stooped real low on the first two nights I tried to quit and built a joint from grinder debris and docked roaches... I'm embarrassed and ashamed about the last one.

Anyways - no need for me to be ashamed. I've given away all of my paraphernalia. Deleted all of my numbers last night because it was getting really tempting, which is funny because it's the first thing I tell everyone to do on here and I still wait 4 days.

I've had a lot of substance misuse problems. Despite this, I never realised how difficult this one would be. I think it's because I'm finally clean. Dry for 3 years. Opiate free for 6 months. 4 days no weed. The last crutch has gone.

How long do these insane dreams keep happening for everyone else? Dreams about using are incredibly common coming off of any drug. I just thought I'd have crazy dreams, not nightmares about relapse... constantly. Last night my manager found a burner phone, found out I was selling weed outside of work and was going to sack me. All of this took place in my high school. I'm 32 years old... and my boss smokes weed... he grows it for god sakes. This is just ridiculous. I don't even sell weed.

Bed sheets are soaked through, I've got a towel next to my bed and another quilt to swap out each time I wake up.

Anyway - despite my emotions yo yo-ing all over the place and sleeping like dog shit, life is still significantly better. I'm active. Hiking the Yorkshire hills. Lifting weights every other day. Reading. Cooking great food instead of high-calorie munchies. Re-written my whole CV. I've applied for 4 better-paid jobs.

Life is good right now. This is probably going to sound like I‚Äôm bipolar and having a manic episode, but I feel happy and hopeful for the future for the first time in my adult life. I went from horrible anxiety, depression and a sprinkling of suicidal ideation at the height of my addiction to feeling calm, focused, and clearheaded on most days. Not every day is amazing but life is not about having zero bad days. 

Anxiety was the only persistent symptom for me after the acute withdrawal phase, and the past 2 weeks I‚Äôve been noticing huge improvements in my anxiety levels. As a result I‚Äôm also now sleeping a full uninterrupted 7-8 hours every night. This is truly a blessing and suffering through low-quality sleep was by far the worst part of getting sober. We‚Äôve all been there, and if you‚Äôre going through it and reading this, know that it will get better. Withdrawal is the tax we have to pay for the abuse we put our brains and bodies through with addiction. There are no shortcuts, just fight like hell until you break through to the other side. You have to want it.

I don‚Äôt know what I was doing for SEVENTEEN FUCKING YEARS with this goddamn insidious drug, but it wasn‚Äôt living. My story is not that crazy, I was a functional stoner. Never let it interfere with my career, but it did drain my wallet and I let a lot of financial/business opportunities slip through my fingers over the years. Had a few long-lasting romantic relationships but outside of that my social life was shit because weed made me anxious and antisocial. But you can‚Äôt approach sobriety with regret, sobriety is about keeping your eyes on the future, forgiving yourself for the past, and never taking the present for granted.

The next step is intensively working on myself to keep improving my mental and physical health, as well as my career prospects and hobby-related passions. And that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been taking active steps toward now, and wouldn‚Äôt you imagine, it‚Äôs a lot easier to take those steps with a sober head. I don‚Äôt believe there is such a thing as ‚Äúbeating your addiction‚Äù, it‚Äôs just a chronic condition that is with you the rest of your life, but SO WHAT? Why would I ever want to smoke again anyway, when I feel this good about myself and my life? No need to throw this feeling away.

I will stay vigilant the rest of my life, and I remind myself every day what I was like and how I felt when I hit my ‚Äúrock bottom.‚Äù I have a list of reasons I quit that I still read every single morning when I wake up.

i‚Äôm 18f , was introduced to weed and all that @15 right before i turned 16. since i live in WA state and weed is legal here , it was more than accessible and was pretty much all my friends did when they‚Äôd hang out with people so i hopped on the bandwagon pretty much. it was kind of like it was the ‚Äòcool‚Äô thing to do (üôÑ) it‚Äôd usually be just two or maybe three of us splitting an eighth and then dividing up the rest after we hung out. soon we‚Äôd buy our own weed and smoke a little by ourselves. this was probably 2 or 3x a week by then. then, i got with my first boyfriend who was a self-proclaimed ‚Äústoner‚Äù at the time. so, naturally i started to smoke with him. then, on my 17th birthday i was gifted a dab pen and i started to hit it everyday , almost like a vape. this went on for about a year until i stopped this past august bc i realized there was literally no benefit. 

i was never really educated on drugs , and just kind of thought that weed didn‚Äôt have any consequences bc all i knew was that ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt cause cancer‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs not addictive‚Äù, making me think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it and that it‚Äôs harmless. since i‚Äôm older now and understand i‚Äôm kind of freaking out that i‚Äôve fucked up my brain permanently and if i‚Äôm gonna live with repercussions from this forever. i got a chest x ray recently which came out clean so i‚Äôm not worried on that aspect, just more about my developing brain and if these effects will be permanent. although, i also have pretty hypochondriac like tendencies so i could also see this as something i‚Äôm trippin over. my boyfriend still smokes almost daily but we are both quitting starting tmr, i‚Äôm not sure how long he will last but this is serious to me. hopefully someone can provide some wisdom/ advice :)

tldr: smoked flower biweekly @16 for 1yr, daily concentrates @17 for 1yr. have since quit, although worried if i caused permanent brain damage / effects

If I would have slept 8 hours a night, that is 75 hours I have been awake, however iv only been sleeping roughly 4 hours every night so that adds up to about 90 hours iv been awake the last 5 days. Not an hour has gone by I don‚Äôt think about my old beloved drug, but my power of will has grow significantly. I will now get to the reason of my post. 

Today was probably the worst day of my life at least the worst day I can remember. It start off half way into my 8 hour shift at fire house subs. See, Iv had lower back issues the past two year and after a few doctor appointments, chiropractic adjustment, and even physical therapy nothing had helped me. I made a decision to go back to the doctor and push for x-rays. Well, I got my x-rays back and hearing the results on the phone(during my 30 min break)They told me something along the lines of.. I have a degenerative back disorder called  retrolisthesis that involved my s1 and s5 disk. I had no idea what any of this meant. Shortly after a few google searches I found my answer. It‚Äôs basically an injury that is un cure-able and mostly people are prescribed muscles relaxers, and injection of steroids in the lower back and in cases that neither of those help, surgery. I‚Äôve lived every day the last 2 years in pain. The best way to describe it is I feel a sharp pain about 3- 4 hours a day that feels like a knife is being inserted into my lower back on my right side, the time the pain is manageable it feel more like a dull pain that is just annoying. I feel back pain every step I take, every time I stand longer then 5 min, any time I sit in a chair over 30 min (including driving), whenever I bend over or squat, even at times while laying down. Sitting in my car reading that I will live the rest of my life with lower back pain that even surgery and drugs won‚Äôt be able to take care of, I cried. (Btw I‚Äôm 21 years old the age of invincibility some say) But I had to get back to work and put my best smile on.( and I did )
I think in my brain iv know for a long time my back was never going to get better, but having the facts in front of my face was like being slapped in the face with ice water and metal hand. It hurt and I was shocked, sad and angry, plus not smoking weed made emotions pour out of me in 10 fold. Work wasn‚Äôt horrible neither was my day. But the realization of my back was enough to wipe every happy thought from my brain and make my day a living hell. 
I‚Äôm a great actor, could probably play in movie I‚Äôd say. None of my coworkers asked me what was wrong and I had cheery voice every time I talked to a customer. But behind that face showed the shadow of so many bad thoughts in my head.  Well the orthopedic doctor will call me next week for my first visit and hopefully what they do can help some of my pain. A lot of the time I smoked weed to forget about the pain but now I may be prescribe pain killers which I will not take under any circumstance. I have far to addicted of a personality to start talking those kind of pills. I will not smoke weed agin for the rest of my life I don‚Äôt care if it helps my pain, I feel like unemotional zombie that cares about little to nothing besides my own pleasure. I know that sounds sick but that is the person I am being addicted to weed. In these last 5 days iv experienced more emotion then iv felt in what feels like months( not good emotions) but emotions all the same and I missed them like I miss my half sister I haven‚Äôt seen in close to 8 years. I know I‚Äôm metamorphosing into the happy fun loving polite person I was before I smoked weed, and I won‚Äôt quit, it just hurts to know it will never be gone. 
I‚Äôm sorry this post is so long and sorry some of it is a little off topic for the group all the same if you had made it to the end of this please share your thoughts I would love it and it helps me stay sober. 
So much love I can‚Äôt even put in words for you beautiful people.

Thanks to the experiences, advice, and insights of this subreddit I decided to give up cannabis for good 1 month ago today.  I'm 21 years old and I've wasted 4ish years of my life being constantly high until now.  

The last month has been a sort of rebirth.  I've met a girl I like a lot which would have never happened before quitting.  I got a raise at my job.  I've been hitting the gym consistently (this may be my new addiction).  I've saved a lot of money and have a plan for my financial future.  All in all, I've made a lot of progress.

That was the good, now the bad.  I've overall been anxious and in my head.  I feel like I am putting a lot of pressure on myself to succeed after years of coasting through life.  This month has not passed without temptation as well.  I live in a house with 3 college students (I dropped out last year, partially cannabis abuse related).  These guys are some of my only good friends right now but they all smoke.  In fact I almost rationalized smoking with one of them moments before writing this post.  What a way to ""celebrate"" 1 month that would've been.  Glad I stayed headstrong.

It's been a tough couple of days... I feel like it oscillates from an okay day to a really tough day... And I don't like that. Truthfully today I really really wanted... I think if I met a friend or was somewhere someone was smoking, I would've. 

I'm struggling with it on an individual basis but I haven't really thought about what happens when I'm in a social setting? Would it be the same vibe?

I was convinced that weed was making me creative. The reality was that I couldn't and I didn't do jack shit because I was high. Sure I was coming up with some ""creative"" ideas and I was even able to write them down but reading them the next morning was mostly hilarious and sad. Yet that didn't stop me from smoking. I was maybe just hoping that a real creative idea will hit me someday soon.

Sometimes (indica) it was giving me a horrible anxiety. I was vividly reminded of my worst memories in life. Reminded that I'm the biggest lazy loser. Yet still I was smoking that crap over and over again.

Sometimes while smoking I felt like being the smartest person alive. It gave me that complete body and mind calmness. I was under the impression that everything is going to be ok in life. And surely I was always chasing for that perfect high over and over.

Also, no matter what, I couldn't stop myself from eating crappy food. The munchies were disgustingly real. I was gaining weight like crazy.
And of course I felt like shit the next day from smoking all night, rewatching retarded comedies, so yeah, I couldn't even exercise the next day. 
I was constantly busy gathering TV shows, movies and stuff to do because everything is more interesting when you are high. Couldn't do or learn anything new really. I was going through life like a Zombie.

I'm so glad and lucky that 1 year ago I finally realized that I was addicted to this crap and I was strong and lucky enough to stop myself from the temptation over and over.

Tried to stop many times. I was hooked back to smoking because I was convinced after a month of two of abstinence that I'm over this shit and I was convinced that one smoke couldn't hurt and I WILL NOT go back on the weed wagon. And I was wrong every single time.

Sure, I still have a lot of problems in life. Always working hard. It's tough. Sometimes I'm sad and sometimes I'm happy. But at least I'm not faking my true real happiness. I'm staying healthy and in my real mindset now.

For whatever reason, I just felt like I was in a funk before leaving the house then had this weird thought pop into my head that if I were to smoke, then I'm going to get a much more pleasurable high than I did before. Being that the dispensary is close to my house, I ended up making a pit stop on the way to do some errands and got a disposable cart. It was almost like I had forgotten that I'm quitting. Once the high kicked in, it really just wasnt that great. In fact, it was kind of inconvenient for me to be high at that moment and only solidified my decision to quit for good with no looking back. One of my friends works at the dispensary (yes, sadly, I've been that much of a regular at the dispensary) and I texted him letting him know that I'm quitting for good. 

I feel stupid, I feel pretty embarrassed but I'm not going to give up. The high is absolutely worn off. On the plus side, I'm more ready than ever to permanently quit for a better life.

I have smoked weed for most of my adult life. I first started smoking at 16 years old in high school (I am 32 yrs old now). At first it was recreational, you know a joint here or there at a party or the beach. I was told all the time that ""weed is not addictive"", so I smoked without fear. I had it in my head that smoking weed would not affect my lungs or cause me to become addicted because it was ""organic"". (obviously, now I know that is not true..).

After weed became legal and the cannabis clubs opened, my weed smoking became a daily habit. Since 2015, I have been ingesting weed - in edibles, drinks, smoking through a vape pen and pipes. It has become like a double life. I go to work and have a normal work day, but as soon as 5pm hits, I start smoking until bedtime.

At some point, my depression was so bad, that I became like zombie-high. I would spend days inside my room, getting as high as I could to forget all the sad and bad things that were happening in my life. It started to affect my relationships and friendships, but I just couldn't quit weed.

Weed was a warm friend. Whenever I needed her, she was there to make me forget my problems. I didn't want to let her go, because I was afraid of how boring life would be when I wasn't high.

Over the years, I was also struggling with alcohol abuse. I was able to get sober from alcohol, but now I feel like I transferred my addictions from alcohol to weed. I'm ready to quit weed too and just be sober.

So, this morning I threw away the pipes, the vape pens and chargers. I threw away everything that reminded me of weed. I'm ready to be done.

2021-02-03 17:38:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lc0fdd/7_days_in/,7 days in.,"22y Male, smoked daily since 15yo with a 5 month break about halfway through. 

Today is day 7. I gotta say I‚Äôm surprised I got here this time after so many failed attempts; ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a tolerance break for a week‚Äù goes a day then gives in every night with the excuse ‚ÄúI want a good nights sleep‚Äù. This pattern has been going on and off my entire time smoking. I always knew it was a bad thing to not use in moderation, but couldn‚Äôt seem to stick with it.

I graduated with my BS last summer and have landed a job in the lab I was an intern at for my last two years of undergrad. I should be happy and fulfilled. I was engaged up until a few months ago which took a toll on my mental health, but instead of trying to better myself, I smoked more and even picked up an alcohol habit (started slowly during beginning of lockdown). The whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm using it and it‚Äôs ok‚Äù dissolved entirely when I realized I‚Äôve just been numbing my pain and reality with getting high, even if it was just for sleep. Never allowing my brain to take a break. 

I researched a lot about the effects of chronic cannabis use on adolescent cognition, leading into adulthood, and I wasn‚Äôt surprised by it. Reduced memory, heightened cortisol levels, irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure, etc. but this still didn‚Äôt make me quit. 

I saw someone mention the other day that smoking everyday is like living life on hard mode and boy let me tell you, I regret it everyday that I didn‚Äôt take a break during undergrad. I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten C‚Äôs in Chemistry and Biology, I wouldn‚Äôt have switched my major from Biology to Psych halfway through so that I could graduate earlier. 

Instead of regretting all that for the rest of my life, I finally chose to just let go of the stuff. I started out by smoking less and less, down to a half gram only at night. The first few days I experienced no issue falling asleep like I used to or any withdrawal signs, and only a slight craving when I smelled my friends dabs. 
I think what‚Äôs helped most is the mindset. I‚Äôm just sick and tired of doing this teeter totter and never getting anywhere. Especially single at 22, supporting myself with two jobs. It just feels immature to keep doing what I‚Äôve been doing. 

My advice for anyone who has been in a similar place is to really try and change your mindset that you do NOT want to continue living that life. What helped also was reading those posts that are numbered with all the benefits of quitting, from someone who went from daily use to none at all for months. Seeing all those positive effects and reminding myself that one day I‚Äôll get there too has been the biggest motivator in the beginning. 

But now it‚Äôs day 7. I‚Äôm reminded by the last time I quit; it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even care that I did it. I know I‚Äôll continue on, but now I just feel groggy, upset, exhausted after a full nights sleep, and an upset stomach due to lack of appetite. 

I know this will pass, but I made this post because I‚Äôm just not feeling proud or any form of happiness for my small accomplishment here that I‚Äôve been yearning for, for so long.

I got two days down and am on day 3! I'm leaving weed for many reasons, specifically that being high constantly has been getting in the way of my writing, fully engaging in therapy, and my studying (LSAT in 2.5 weeks). 

I have only slept for about 6 hours in the last two nights combined. I can't function on this little amount of sleep. I just lay there in bed mulling over my worst traumas and wake up feeling like shit. I can't study like this and lying awake thinking about such sad things is driving me crazy. It's like just the act of laying in bed awake makes my mind a magnet for the saddest things. 

This is the most strong I've been with leaving weed in years and I want to keep this going, I'm not even getting cravings! But the insomnia is driving me crazy enough already that I'm worried I'm going to break, not even to enjoy the high, just to get some stupid rest. I've tried meditating and guided podcasts but they do nothing or maybe I'm not doing it right. (Edit: I've tried melatonin, relaxing night routine, no phone for a couple hours before bed. Probably helps but not much.)

I've also read other posts talking about dreaming with sobriety and to hold out because of how much better that is. But as far as I can tell this doesn't apply to me. I've always had pretty vivid dreams regardless of whether I was smoking my days away or not. These past two days though I feel like I've barely dreamed if at all, but then again it could be because I barely slept.

It's been hard, but not as hard as I thought. Actually being READY is what's made this possible. 

Withdrawal symptoms are REAL. Noticing lots of headaches. My sleep was terrrrrrible last night. Took nearly 4 hours to fall asleep and then had the most broken few hours of sleep following that. My appetite is fine and I haven't been binge eating at night (bye bye munchies!). 

Whats helped is distractions, journalling, telling all my friends and family I'm quitting to hold me accountable, essential oils for my headaches... meditation!!! Incorporating meditation techniques into my day has been amazing. When I get a trigger I just picture a pot leaf floating down a river stream... It helps to slow down my obsessive thoughts and cravings! Also I have an app called grounded that counts my sobriety down to the second. 

I credit a lot of this to my counselor who has been working on EMDR therapy with me for the past 2.5 years, and heavily over the past few months. She really helped me work through the stages of addiction and bringing me to the action phase. 

Does it get better from here? How long did you notice headaches and sleep disruption?? I have health problems (epilepsy and bipolar) that require me to have a restful sleep. Bit worried about triggering an episode and hoping to get a better sleep tonight.

I know that you might know somebody who only smokes 2 times a month and everything is going great but that‚Äôs not the kind of people looking for help on this sub. If you have ever been addicted to weed it is almost impossible to go back to a moderate way of smoking. 
Once you have been smoking (almost) every day for multiple month or even years, your brain is wired to crave weed. And every time you smoke you activate those connections.

Also, this morning I was thinking about something. The subject of boredoom comes often in this Sub. Here's my 2 cents. If you burn your finger on a hot surface, you will feel pain. That's normal, because through millions of years of evolution, our body was designed to save you from hurting yourself. Physical pain is only an alarm that something is wrong and you should be carefull about a certain area of your body. In that example, your finger that is being burned. It's exactly the same thing with anxiety, depression or boredoom. That's your brain (or soul if you're spiritual) telling you there's something you need to change in your life. And a sober person feel that pain (depression and anxiety) and reacts to it by changing something in his life. But when you're using drugs, you ignore that 'alarm' so you're okay with being in a shitty place in your life. You're okay with being less than you can be. You're okay with playing video games for 10 hours or watch tv. Now that I'm sober I don't even want to watch tv. I'm like, why am I not learning something new, why am I not training I have 20 pounds to loose.

I told myself last Monday that I needed to focus more on this and that change has to happen. I‚Äôm not the most proactive person anyway and so weed makes me feel incredibly lethargic and unmotivated. Something as simple as washing-up ends up being such a chore when I‚Äôm high and on the other end of the spectrum, if I‚Äôm feeling I have more of a spring in my step, I‚Äôm desperate for the whole house to be gutted clean. 
From Monday-Thursday last week I got super motivated. Started walking and working out everyday, making the effort to eat healthier, concentrating on my college work and focusing on self-care. Friday came around and so the weed came out.. & that was it. My whole 4 days ruined. I smoked in the evenings Fri & Sat but Sunday I spent the whole day stoned and mentally punishing myself for being so weak and useless. Spent most of the weekend with the munchies and eating tonnes of crap. I smoked again last night and had to have the conversation with myself.. this can no longer be a weekend thing. This is the trouble isn‚Äôt it? Convincing ourselves we hold the control and yet after a few days good work is completed and the rolling tray is back out. I‚Äôd love to teach myself how to hold control and be able to decide when I want and don‚Äôt want it but the reality I have to face is I can‚Äôt. It has it‚Äôs claws in me and I‚Äôm fully dependant. Nobody else around me feels like this and I feel super isolated. I stick on a late-night ‚Äòstoner‚Äô comedy film or make some delicious foods and my cravings scream at me. I can‚Äôt enjoy good things anymore without it. I know deep down it‚Äôs not good for my mental health and while short-term it may aid things, long-term damage is being done. I‚Äôm sick of the paranoia, anxiousness, mind-fog, lack of sleep without it. I need to find balance again.

I smoked since I was 16 and am now 30 years old. I thought I could never live without pot, but I realized I could no longer live while high. When I was high, I was basically the living dead.

 I was completely unable to function, struggling with debilitating anxiety and depression, and even experienced psychosis multiple times and have been hospitalized.

 I started going to Marijuana Anonymous meetings and hanging out on r/leaves, watching YT vids about pot addiction, and found out I was not alone. I listened to what helped others, made friends with others in recovery, and tried to make changes in my life. 

I gotta say, staying clean does take work. Just giving up the pot isn't enough for me or for those I've listened to who are clean. I've made it to almost 6 months clean recently and relapsed because I stopped doing anything for myself. It's easy to fall into old patterns when I become complacent. 

One big thing that led to the relapse was drinking alcohol. I told myself it would be alright because it's not my drug of choice and I didn't consider myself an alcoholic. Well, being under the influence of alcohol doesn't put you in a mindset to make the best decisions, and it quickly led to me picking up some pot. 

I've found I needed to stay away from all drugs, keep up a healthy self-care routine, go to MA meetings regularly ( for anyone interested: https://marijuana-anonymous.org/find-a-meeting/ ), and keep up some sort of social life. 

Life is so much lighter and better without pot. I can think clearly, my mood is generally pretty good most days, I have some anxiety sometimes but I can deal with it, and I have never experienced any psychosis symptoms when clean (I've even gotten off of my psych meds), and I find myself interested in and connected with people in ways I couldn't be while high.",54,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5030348}"

My head is just hopping from all the good reasons to smoke weed to all the terrible systemic issues in our society that pushed me to smoking daily, to being anxious and depressed and just generally thinking about the only other way out that I can see.

I started smoking regularly because I've been dealing with depression and anxiety my entire life and never found anything that helped. No medication helped. My insurance company refused me therapy because of the weed abuse, even though I started smoking regularly after two years of searching for a therapist and finding nothing. I've tried applying for addiction therapy and the barriers are so high I feel completely helpless and alone. Sleep is the only respite from this constant indescribable cloud of sadness in my brain.

Throughout the pandemic I've felt completely unable to tackle any of the things that are piling up on me, I'm literally consumed with just getting through the day. That's all i can focus on, getting through the day until I can finally sleep again. My head is just hazy all the time, but when I smoke that first time in the day, I'm able to do something, even if it's just a little, because the haze is lifted for a few hours and I actually feel like a capable human being and not an anxious mess. Without that, I just don't know how to cope with daily life.

I've tried meditating, but it just fills my head with all of my worst thoughts. I'm genuinely terrified of being alone with my own thoughts, so I'm always distracting myself with either netflix or music. I just don't know what to do.

For context, I started around the time I turned 18, and I'm now 23. I have smoked on probably 90% of days since the first time, with some short breaks in between, usually on visits to family abroad.

To hype myself up, here are some reasons why this time is different, and therefore going to work:

1. **It's entirely up to me.** I have moved to a new city recently and due to the pandemic and living alone I have not met many people. In some ways it sucks, but this means I don't have an immediate social circle full of people who enjoy smoking. I also don't have a boyfriend who smokes, which has held me back from quitting in the past, because I felt guilty for forcing them to quit something they didn't find problematic, and I couldn't do it with weed in the house. 
2. **I don't see it as a break.** I'm not thinking ""if I can do 3 weeks then I've proven to myself that I'm not addicted and I can smoke again once in a while"". 
3. **I know that moderating is not an option**. I'm not thinking ""but it's alright on the weekends"", nor ""one spliff a day is probably alright"". I find cannabis terribly addictive, and I'm not proud of it. I need to stop telling myself that once in a while is fine. I cannot do once in a while - before long it's every day, and soon enough it's all day every day. So I must quit. 
4. **There's nothing left to like about weed.** Smoking is fighting regular boredom with anxious, cloudy, expensive boredom. Smoking is fighting potential failure with guaranteed failure. Smoking turns socialising into vegetating together. In fact, as I'm writing this, in the long run smoking makes me eat, shit, sleep, think, remember, communicate, breathe, and fuck poorly. What the hell? I actually need and value all of those things! 
5. **It's time to get in the driver's seat.** I didn't move to a new and exciting city just to continue my old loser patterns, did I? I actually really like it here and want to be a part of it. More importantly, I finally want to get in the driver's seat of this ride I've been on for 23 years, and I want to be able to confidently say that I belong in that seat, it's not borrowed or temporary, and I don't need an instructor beside me because I unapologetically know what I'm doing and where I want to go. I just have to take good care of the machine and work out the exact directions along the way.

Last February, my girlfriend of 3.5 years started seeing my best friend (at the time) behind my back, they were the 2 closest people to me and this was also my first heartbreak, I did not take it lightly and was smoking a lot every single day. I recovered from that after a couple months and have forgotten about them completely and have no contact or feelings towards them now. 

When I was younger I had above average intelligence (trying not to sound egotistical) and always got the top grades in school and I have a vast interest in many topics, but now I feel like I stopped progressing and I have not gained much knowledge or skills because of weed. I find it very hard to learn things at the moment and my focus is completely non existant. 

My financial situation is fairly good for someone that is 20, but being someone of high ambition and striving for greatness, I feel like weed has really been holding me back from where I want to be. I have tried to stop for the 4th time within the last half a year, having smoked for the last time on the 31st of January.

I am now trying to do plenty of cardio and weightlifting as well as eating clean, and not touching weed at all, but 3 days in, I feel depressed af and ashamed of myself that I have found myself in this position and it feels like I'm aboard an emotional roller-coaster.

I'm not a heavy smoker, I've been smoking for the last 3 years on a weekly basis. Sometimes once a week, sometimes several days in a row. 
You might think this is ok, but it's not! Let me explain.

I have quite a demanding and stressful job, 80-hour work weeks are common. Working in such conditions for several years definitely took a toll on my health. Sleep deprivation didn't help either, my mental health was quickly deteriorating: 
1) I lost interest in my hobbies.
2) I didn't want to socialize.
3) I was feeling depressed most of the time.

To cope with this, I started smoking. This was my Pandora's box. 
I felt like Neo in the Matrix. I jumped into a rabbit hole that leads to a Wonderland. I felt happy afterwards, and thought 'Wow, I do feel better, why not smoke from time to time, just to keep my mental health intact'. 

Little did I know that this is only true when I'm 'connected to the Matrix', i.e. smoking. The feeling of relief afterwards is just an aftertaste, nothing more.The real world and real feelings are passing you by, you're trapped!

I described my smoking habits earlier, believe me, this is too much.

After some time my tolerance to mj increased, which meant that my dopamine receptors were 'worn-out'. To put it simply, it has become harder to have fun and socialize, because I had zero interest, total apathy. 
I started to drink more coffee, watch porn and smoke. Can you see the trend? I craved more dopamine. This was a vicious cycle. 

Eventually, I started to look tired, had sleep problems and became very irritable. Some of my friends told me that I became hard-nosed as well. Clearly, I didn't want to be this guy.

Now, I crave much less, my sleep is much better and I started to see colors in life.

It's really painful to see the wasted time.


A few advices:

1) Don't be hard on yourself, show yourself a compassion. This is really important. 

2) Start working out, little by little. When you workout your brain releases dopamine, it's a perfect substitute.

3) Practice mindfulness. This helped me tremendously to be calm and present.

4) Cut ties with people with whom you usually smoke. Ideally, start this endeavor together.
Some of them will try to sugar coat. No! Be determined.

5) Sleep well.

6) Toss your bong, papers and other 420 accessories.

Sometimes you'll feel discouraged, and lost, but always remember you're doing it for yourself and your family. Keep your head up my brother/sister, you'll overcome this!

I just smoked my last dab, and I think I‚Äôm ready to give sobriety a try. For a while, at least. I‚Äôm scared of my mind, mostly.

I need to quit. 
I smoked for ,17 years since I was 19. I got into it to cope with the some heavy issues I had from my dad and highschool years. I continued to use as an escape from a reality I didint like, but also just to have fun. I smoked constantly. A lot. 

I quit for 12 days and I came back much lower level.  What I found is completely odd. 
All of my IBS and majority of my GERD symptoms are completely weed related. My weird stomach sensitivies, anxiety, weird heart beats, diahreea are very well related to me consuming weed. I saw doctors for this, I take medication. I deny weeds role until I recently quit for 12 days and it all cleared up 95 percent. 

I need to quit for good but idk if I can do this on my own cold turkey method. I want to heck I even quit cigarettes ages ago, but the mental enhancement I get from weed I chase. 

How do I go about getting help to resolve this?  The fact I quit for 12 days is pretty huge I haven't done that for probably 10 years.

Ive been basically an every day smoker since I was 18, and Im 25 now. A little backstory, I struggled with a traumatic upbringing, but was adamantly straight edge after watching so many of my family struggle with drugs. Well I was feeling like a rebellious young adult and smoke for the first time. It was anxiety inducing and not enjoyable at all, but I had this weird urge to do it again. And that continued until, well, now. Im a nurse aide, and full time nursing student that has worked covid units up until a month ago, and this past month Ive been going to a facility that hasnt had any covid. I‚Äôve seen so much fucking death this year, more than I imagined I would when I first started. The first 10 months of nursing, before covid I had three deaths total. The week of Christmas, I had 6 patients die on me in 4 days, and that was capitalized on by the fact I haven‚Äôt been able to have a family gathering since Christmas of 2019. I love my job with a burning passion and love to care for people when they need it most, but to put it mildly, my mental health has been absolute shit this past year. 

Anyways, me and my boyfriend ran out of weed on the morning of 2/1, and we are broke until Friday. We both agreed we should just quit, either completely or at least until we get our own place in March to make it as a reward to help motivate us both to stay strong. Well, Im on day 2, and I haven‚Äôt slept for more than 3 hours because of insomnia, hot/cold flashes that will have me dripping sweat just sitting still doing nothing, I can‚Äôt eat because of nausea and pain, Ive thrown up at work tonight from the nausea. If I try eating, literally just holding food in my mouth to chew will make my stomach turn. I get migraines from it, and anxiety at 1000 for however long until my body chills out. And the fact I experience these symptoms constantly thru the day/night, it makes me so anxious that coworkers might accuse me of being on harder drugs or something because Im over here withdrawing like a crackhead from pot. I have BPD, and PTSD as well so I know those are also just amplifying the feelings Im having currently. But there also lies the problem with the BPD, without weed, I feel so unmotivated, anxious, depressed, suicidal thoughts (Im not in danger, I have no desire to harm myself, but that kinda makes these thoughts even more awkward to have). 

So basically my question is the headline. How do you guys do this and be successful? I know not everybody gets withdrawals from weed like this, I know its a me thing and not necessarily a weed thing, probably stems from my family‚Äôs substance abuse genes. But to the people that do go thru this hell, how do you guys manage to quit without totally disrupting your life?? I work 55-60 hour weeks, and sometimes Covid units to get me and my boyfriend out of his parents‚Äô house because they are toxic alcoholics that cause issues in our relationship and lives in general. I desperately do want to quit and feel clean and healthy like all of you guys talk about, and like Ive experienced in the past. I just don‚Äôt want my work or life to struggle just because Im trying to prove a point ya know? Any advice is welcomed, thank you guys who take the time to read this.",7,{'covid': 4},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6836929}"
2021-02-03 00:26:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lbgigf/day_5/,Day 5,"5 days sober. I was introduced to weed when I was 19 (now 41). I have quit so many times I have lost count. I quit when having kids, and then managed to quit for about 8 mos a few years ago, when my then-husband was in a car accident suffering a traumatic brain injury (coma, in-patient rehab for months, it was rough), and I was left to care for our 2 young kids while also juggling work, bills, and handling his medical stuff. He's alive, but forever changed, and the behaviors caused by the brain injury ended in us divorcing (throwing things, breaking things, cursing and yelling at me in front of the kids). That was hard. I held on for a surprisingly long time, but eventually asked a friend to bring some over. I had my first ever panic attack that night after we smoked, and yet I slipped and kept going. It is never just one time. Never just one more sack.

I did manage to quit for a few months before the pandemic, and we all know what happened. One of my children is autistic, and trying to manage virtual learning (he has to have someone there with him doing the work the entire time) and working full-time was overwhelming.  I have been smoking off and on since then. I have a couple of degrees, am professionally successful, and it doesn't matter - I struggle with my addiction. It's hard for me to say addiction, but that's what it is. I smoke 3 times a weekday, morning, noon, and night, and who even knows how much on the weekend. My kids don't know, my family & friends don't know, no one does. I have never joined a group, been to meetings, etc., but I thought this might help this time. I have been to therapy but I am incredibly stubborn and strong-willed. I function quite well on it, at least on the outside, and thus have often rationalized my addiction as something I can manage because no one knows I do it, so I must be really good at it and that makes it okay. Insert eye roll here. The rationalizations are endless, really. I work really hard, I'm stressed, I've earned it, it's Tuesday.....

But I am now working on a professional certification that I have already blown once because of my addiction. I got \*so\* close and then fucked up and stopped. And then started and stopped the process....how many times in the last 8 years? I don't know. But I finally pulled it together after the accident and I have passed all but one part, and I have until 3/10 to pass the last one. I sit on 2/13, which gives me enough time to sit 1 more time if I don't pass. This is one of THE hardest certifications to earn, and I CANNOT BLOW IT THIS FUCKING TIME. I am in tears. I wanted to do this so that I could ensure financial stability in terms of savings for myself and college for my kids, as well as to really utilize my skills at work and step up the next rung on the ladder. There are so many goals tied into this certification. I cannot let this be the reason I don't get it.

Thank you for this group. I have been lurking the last couple of days after stumbling across it. I do experience withdrawals (pretty much all of them except for vomiting), and this time has been no different. Today was a good day, a really good day, and I feel excellent that I've made it this far. I finally had a day where I could eat properly and my emotions aren't so up and down, and the hot flashes have gone, so it's better than day 1 by miles. The night sweats will probably last for another week, and my energy will pick up around the same time. My memory was better today too. I know I have a problem. I need to admit that, own it. If anyone has any advice on how to get through stressful times without caving in and smoking, I am ALL EARS. That seems to be a pivotal point for me that I have yet to figure out how to navigate sober. Anyway, thanks for listening, thanks for your posts that keep me motivated.

I still crave a fat blunt here and there, and sometimes I think about how it would feel to light up again.

However, I know my productivity has increased substantially, my thoughts have become much more clear, and I am not constantly numbing myself anymore. I have goals to reach, places to see, and money to save. I would rather sacrifice the high of marijuana rather than sacrificing those things.

I have smoked for about 2 years straight, and my usage increased to almost every 2 hours daily. My withdrawal symptoms included increased irritability, irrational thoughts, low quality sleep, extremely vivid dreams (some of which were related to past traumas), and cold sweats. Additionally, emotions that I have been avoiding came to surface quite strongly.

After 11 days, most of these symptoms are gone, however, my sleep troubles and vivid dreams still remain. Also, I get extremely bored at times, however, I know that is simply a matter of finding something new to do. I do not need marijuana to be happy and the negatives outweigh the benefits, especially with daily use.

As you can probably imagine I relapsed. It got even worse for me though. I when from being sober for 4 months and I smoked with my buddies once and immediately went out and bought a dab rig and got right back into the swing of smoking every hour of every day.

It was great to smoke again... AT FIRST. but being 19 years old and still living with my mom (Not in college) it started to take a toll on everyone and everything in my life. My girlfriend at the time didn't know that I started smoking again, and so naturally, I tried to hide it at first. she eventually found out and it started taking a toll on our relationship. Not only did it affect my relationship with her, but it was also hurting my mom and my little sister to see me high, and always smell weed coming from the basement. Not to mention I pretty much stopped seeing my dad for a couple of months.

As Steve-O once said, you know it's bad when the drugs are telling you to stop. as of today, I'm just over 2 weeks sober and I have plans to join the Navy. I have completely turned my life in a 180 and quit cold turkey after dabbing 24/7 for 5 months. I have never felt more present in my own life, and I'm so happy to be spending more time with my family. However, I know that if I stay hanging out with the same crowd of people I will never stay sober, and it sucks because I don't want to be a loser with no friends that just stays at home. So I've decided to enlist in the U.S. Navy.

It's awesome!

I want to share my experience in hopes it helps at least 1 person.

When I was around 13-14 I remember smoking my first bowl. I was blaaaaaazed and I honestly hated it. The thing that really got me smoking daily was the fact that weed masked my emotions.

I didn't have to deal with my anxiety, depression, or low self esteem. I felt like I could be happy for once. That happiness was a facade that I held on to for over 10 years.

I remember the day when I really started smoking every day. I was anxious and upset that I could never get a relationship working for me and just wanted to escape. 

I kept pushing past the uncomfortable high because it was better than being me.

Let me tell you, weed was the hardest for me to stop using.

I would always justify it with ""it's not addictive."" ""I'm not smoking at work."" ""At least I'm using heroin."" ""I'm still paying all my bills on time."" Yada yada yada yada.

**All bullshit excuses.**

I hated my life, I hated my job and I used weed to mask my emotions.

It wasn't till I was working at a ski resort that got the ball rolling towards change. A Chinese exchange asked me about relationships and how many gf's I had etc. Etc. It led me to saying I haven't had many relationships, well she asked ""why"" and that made say this...

""Cause I hate myself."" 

I felt cathartic in owning that fact and made me want to change. I realized right then and there the primary reason I used drugs. Now, I didn't stop smoking that day, that week, or that month but it moved me into contemplation. It made me question my use of weed and why I continued to keep using it.

I didn't like being irritated at work because I want to go home and smoke. 
I didn't like feeling groggy in the morning. 
I didn't like passing out midday because I'm too stoned. 
I didn't like spending the money.

*I didn't like it.* 

So fast forward a couple of months and I'm back at home, jobless and trying to find something other than kitchen work because all I have been doing is cooking for 7 years. 

I couldn't find anything so I bite my tongue and applied for a cook position at a detox facility.

They called me that day and I got the job on Thanksgiving. How weird.

I still smoked when I started working there and still had the justification of ""at least I'm not in here, on the other side."" Blah blah blah

Now the coffin in the nail for me finally putting an end to daily smoking was when I was just playing a game with my friend and he says ""Hey! You're doing so good today, what's the difference?"" 

I didn't smoke that day. *That* was the difference. I realized that if I could *that* much better in a video game, how much better can I do in life?

Now that I stopped smoking I thought it would be easier for me to get into a relationship.

*TRICK!*

Smoking for over 10 years consistently had stunted my emotional growth.

I was feeling exactly the same feelings from when I was 16 and couldn't handle the negative emotions.

I felt anxious, nervous, depressed, neurotic, and had mood swings out the ass. I felt like a child and that made me feel like shit.

I just wanted to get my shit together without being irritated, anxious and depressed every day. I was tired of not being the best me.

After a few attempts at relationships and absolutely being let down I switched my focus onto myself and decided to go back to school.

Now I'm still cooking at the detox facility and hating every minute of it! A shitty boss and long hours. I need out ASAP. 

So I somehow made the switch to work in the detox unit as a caseworker. Everyone told me that it was so hard, stressful and I wouldn't like it.

I loved this job. I loved the way some clients lit up because they were talked to like a person instead of an addict. The work was cake, documentation was cake. This job was cake compared to the stress of kitchen work. 

I knew what I wanted to do for school after working there. I designated my degree to be in psychology, got financial assistance through a government program to pay for my bachelors, started going to therapy and taking anti depressants for my depression. Things finally started to look up. 

I was taking care of my mental health, physical health, and my career. Once I moved into the job I'm in now, things just took off! 

I have a group of people that continue to make me a better person everyday. My boss cares about me, my coworker and I have a friendship so strong that we're basically brothers, my job is amazing and my life is great.

I'm a certified addiction technician applying for my certified addiction specialist cert. A year and half left for my bachelors and the prospect of having a career that both makes me money and fulfills a greater purpose pushes me everyday to continue to work on myself.

I still struggle with relationship issues, food issues, and self esteem issues. I still go to therapy but now I can manage my emotions and my thoughts.

My worst day now is better than my best day smoking weed and using drugs. 

To whomever made it this far, thank for reading my story. It means a lot to me and I hope there is something that helps you too. üòÅ

Yes, of course these things are great, but they can be quite hard and intimidating pursuits if you aren't doing them already or if you have never done them before - especially when you're also battling withdrawals.

**Enter: THE SAUNA**

It's super easy. Sit there. Sweat a lot. Feel the marijuana leaving your body with every drip of sweat. Drink lots of water before and after. Listen to podcasts or music you like (with low volume through headphones), or just sit in silence. 

I'm not going to go into the countless benefits of the sauna, but **there are SO many**, especially when you are quitting marijuana. I highly recommend looking into research done by Dr. Jari Laukkanen and Dr. Rhonda Patrick. These two are true leaders in the sauna world. 

A few notable things for our community is that, especially during the initial weeks of withdrawal, the sauna will **help you sleep better, get your clear head back quicker, and naturally increase dopamine.** Seriously, you will feel good as fuck after \~30 minutes in 185F (85C). Of course, listen to your body and be cautious if you are alone and have no built up tolerance to heat.

 It's incredibly nice. Just ask the Fins, the Germans, the Canadians, or the Russians. Especially the Fins.

Lastly, before going to a public sauna, send prayers that you don't have anyone talking on the phone, exercising, going in/out excessively, etc. **There is public sauna etiquette, please read about it before you visit your health club.** You will encounter rude people in the sauna at some point, and that is ok. Expect it, accept it, and be kind.

PS: I know finding a sauna with COVID can be hard, but look around. They can be found in gyms, rec centers, MMA gyms, spas, and other places. I go everyday.

Here's the thing. I didn't question it. I didn't stop myself at all. I didn't even realize it wasn't a good idea ... not to mention that she smokes & the smell was delicious. 

So now I've looked up for more online, where I used to buy, to get ready for my order. To buy more because now I want more - I'm craving fierce. 

If i buy more, then it's a full on relapse of starting my smoking in the AM with my morning coffee and hiding from the world even more. I know my guilt would stop me from keeping in contact with others as actively as I have been and that's the thought i keep reminding myself of.

So I am currently on day 8 of quitting after smoking everyday since I was 18, I am turning 24 next week. 

I quit in August for 8 days and felt all the symptoms discussed in this thread, nausea, anxiety, night terrors, sweats. Now that I quit 8 days ago I really haven‚Äôt experienced much of this besides some nausea in the beginning. I tried tapering off this time and limited myself to a bowl/ bowl and a half a day to slowly cut my tolerance. 

What I am experiencing now is weight loss. I am eating, not A LOT but definitely am eating more than the last time i quit. I also have been having protein shakes if I find that chewing makes me too nauseous. Since I quit last week i weighed about 150 today 8 days later i‚Äôm 145, yesterday i was 146. I feel like that‚Äôs a lot for someone who has been eating and staying hydrating. Is this a normal thing when quitting? 

A part of me thinks this is because when I would get high after work i would ‚Äúbinge eat‚Äù and eat as much as I could until my high is gone. Now I am eating 2/3 meals a day and not really snacking.

Obviously no hate to anyone else, we all go at our own pace, but seeing all of these stories of people who started smoking when I did (21-22) and are just now quitting about 5 or more years from where I am now (Turning 25 this month) and its given me a sobering view of what my life will be like if I don't quit now.

I started smoking when my second dog died a month after my first one (he was 15 and we knew it was coming, we think she died from grief because she was only 8 so it wrecked me) and it honestly helped for a little while. I had just moved in with my parents again after I dropped out of an acting school because I realized I didn't want to be an actor so I was pretty directionless and, like my favorite quote and tattoo say, ""Not all those who wander are lost"". I was looking for a new path and weed made my creativity skyrocket and helped me make some really fun D&D campaigns and other artistic endeavors to pass the time while I wandered through life...but now I can't stay focused on anything, none of my hobbies interest me, and I keep staying up way too late. Plus, I've developed ""Cyclical vomiting syndrome"" (pretty self explanatory) either from the weed, the stress, or the stress caused by the weed. I keep saying ""Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, I'll quit tomorrow"" but quitting was my goal for 2020.

Luckily I'm in therapy already and I've been throwing around the idea that I'm smoking as a way to procrastinate doing my actual work. I'm scared of the risk of failing so I'm using weed as an excuse to not try, but eventually I have to put on my big boy pants and face the music. It is comforting to know there are so many of you out there dealing with this alongside me. When my therapist first formally diagnosed me with marijuana dependence, I thought ""Fuck that's so lame, what kind of loser gets addicted to weed?"" to which one of my closest friends informed me ""Lots of people do actually, especially people with depression.""

I had a PTSD episode on Saturday, the day after I stopped smoking (both were unrelated) and called out of work (my bosses are very understanding with me as they are aware that I have a mental illness without either of us mentioning it and I‚Äôm blessed to have that going for me) and then I tried to go back in Sunday but I had a full blown panic attack at work and my boss took one look at me and told me to go home. I then had another panic attack in my car. It took 20 minutes to makes a 2 minute drive because I had to fight every urge to not slam the gas. 

The PTSD and the withdrawals together are for lack of a better term, absolute agony. I‚Äôve quit before and I weened off slow and for me personally it worked really well I actually can moderate myself so long as I don‚Äôt start back up when I stop (this happened last time). I quit cold turkey this time because I was in a place where I refused to let the smoke and what it repressed control me anymore. But I didn‚Äôt consider how long and how intense my smoking habit increased since restarting. I think if I continue cold turkey rn I‚Äôm going to have serious health problems. 

However I do have a plan of attack with weening, and I also have my motivation to quit this time as Ive never actually really want to quit before. I went from smoking my brains out daily to one hit of a pen (I‚Äôve only used pens the past couple years) at night before I go to sleep and since the only cart I kept is 10/11 empty it is giving a low enough dose to not give me withdrawals and after 2-3 days it essentially becomes a placebo high when the cart is empty. Then when the placebo finally wears off I associate weed to no longer working and bam I‚Äôm golden. This is what personally has been tested and works for me. The problem was my motivation to actually stop completely bc it would just turn into a tolerance break. But my motivation now is my best friend, they mean the absolute world to me. When I told her I‚Äôm finally quitting, she was so fucking happy and proud. And it was in that moment I decided no matter what happens, I have to follow through. If it costs me my best friend it is not worth having. I can‚Äôt let them down. 

The only snag with the whole thing is the initial guilt of smoking when weening. But it really is a necessity for me to ween just for my brain chemistry not to go completely out of wack. The guilt goes away as the placebo kicks in because im not feeling ‚Äúhigh‚Äù, But I‚Äôm still satisfying that urge to ‚Äútake a smoke‚Äù even though there‚Äôs nothing there. 

But yeah that‚Äôs my little tirade. I‚Äôm going every other day right now just to get used to extended periods of time. I‚Äôm still shaken from the past couple days but I‚Äôm doing better and trying to make good choices in the meantime.

100 days of sobriety has:
- helped me begin to understand what raw genuine happiness looks and feels like.
- created a space for me to work on myself physically, spiritually and mentally.
- allowed me to create stronger relationships with those that I love and care about.
- forced me to examine the parts of my life and myself that I am not happy with. 
- aided me in creating a new identity with new goals, values and aspirations. 

I am still very much at the beginning of my journey , I look forward to what life has to offer (new) me every single day.

For anyone at the true beginning of their recovery, I hope you stay with it, anything worth having is not easy. It requires tough introspection and non-linear progression. 

At Day 100, I still have tough days, days that I want to go back to the comfort and familiarity of my old life. I‚Äôve learned to accept these feelings, knowing they will slowly pass with time. 

Overall I am happier (even on a tough day), my mind is clearer, I can read/think/listen/hear/speak/smell with more clarity than I ever have. I literally dream every single night, something I have not done since I was a kid. 

But most important of all, I am proud of myself. Proud that I promised sobriety to myself and stuck with it. Here‚Äôs to another 100 days and to all the hundreds of 100 days after that one.

I stopped following this subreddit about a week ago because I didn't need it anymore, and I think that's a testament to how quitting works - it's hard until it isn't. 

After smoking weed daily for years the first week and a half were brutal. I was moody, couldn't fall asleep, and constantly thought about smoking again. After that I would think about it sometimes and feel like quitting wasn't worth it. 

Then I stopped thinking about it. My anxiety went down tremendously, I wake up feeling refreshed, I fall asleep pretty close to on demand, and (my personal favourite) I feel in control! I've saved a bunch of money and even more time. I don't feel like an addict anymore - I don't feel like carpet surfing for weed because I'm scared I've run out. I've experienced emotional growth and I have time to cry instead of feel numb. 

I've got a long way to go, but gosh is it nice to be in the light! I have no desire to smoke again because it just doesn't sound like a good use of time. 

To everyone starting their sober journey, please remember that there is a light and it isn't that far away. You'll reap so much by giving up weed - you can do it and you'll be better for it! Good luck and feel free to reach out if you need a friend!

I could not enjoy or tolerate anything without being stoned, waking up irritated till I smoke and numb my brain. 
I finally asked myself; when will this stop? I can't keep lying to myself and saying that I am not addicted and that I can quit later and that weed is the answer.

The irritation is the main withdrawal for me and I just want reassurance that it will all go away and I will feel good.

After a few weeks or months away, weed can start to feel like a good old friend we have not checked in with for a while. Just remember to look at that list of reasons that you quit that friend in the first place. 

Remember the bad times with this old friend. He is very clingy and never wants to leave. He stays over way too late.  He is there first thing in the morning. He calls and texts you constantly and can be a real distraction from important things.  He often gets us into a situation where we are engaging in risky behavior and making poor decisions.  He loved taking you to eat junk food and fast food. His constant need for attention caused you to push away friends and family.  Time always flew by when we were having ""fun"", but then we were left wondering where did all the time go? And for some weird reason your breath always stank and your lungs hurt when you were hanging out?!?

If you meet up with the old friend, you will be stuck with him for a while and that list of reasons that you quit him will crop back up again.  Don't be tempted by that missing spark of excitement in your life.  Along with the good times, your old friend Juan was a very toxic friend.

Sorry for the double posting.. Have some thoughts on my mind and wanting some advice from the community.

For starters, I was a daily smoker for over 4 years. I have since stopped smoking for about 5 weeks (in the next hour). Cold turkey, I might add. I have depression and towards the end, I feel like I was self-medicating to cope with my day to day activities. Leaving late to work because I didn't want to be sober, Not wanting to see my S/O because I wanted to be high... etc.. etc.. I finally realised that it wasn't helping my situation and after my last joint on 5 weeks ago, I decided to quit.

Two nights past and I had a dream. There were cops all around the street, one of them was talking to some random old lady across the street. I went over and admitted to being the one to ""smoke the dope"" and proceeded to hand over my things. The dream cop then started saying that ""I was doing the right thing"". I woke up.

Since this event, I haven't had any. I do have an addictive personality and have started substituting alcohol.. Yes this is bad, I am working on it.

My main concern is that I have ""urges"" to smoke again. I can be around people who smoke, or have it in the open, and I can often hear myself arguing with me about whether or not I should. I haven't, But am wondering if this is a common effect after not taking any.\\

I do enjoy the euphoria of being high, and especially the social aspect of it. Since quitting, it has become a lot harder to socialise with others and ""express"" myself. I often feel bored and as if there isn't much meaning to things other than to just ""keep going"".

No I am not suicidal.

I just am at an akward point in my journey and want to hear what other ents have experienced. Weed certainly has made me the person I am today, and without it I still think I would be an akward person who doesn't understand the little details.

Thanks for reading, hopefully some others might have ideas, thoughts and experiences they'd like to share.

I suppose I'm not one for milestones since ""every day is a milestone"" as in every day is a battle with varying degrees of difficulty. I do understand it's important to be happy with little victories and achievements, but maybe it's hard because how I used to reward myself for everything was with weed, so I avoid the idea of rewards for now. 

Keeping my head down and focused on the goal of continuing my life without the stuff to prove to myself that it was what was holding me back from my potential. Being ""functional"" just wont cut it anymore.

It's really put a major dent in my ego. I hate myself everyday for not knowing it was damaging me. I'm still going through a lot even after almost 4 months clean. It really pisses me off to have people around me smoking that ugly ass plant. I live with the person so I have to tolerate it or I'll be homeless. It pisses me off to live almost right behind a dispensary. It's turned me into a psychotic vulnerable narcissist moron as I'm consumed by self hatred and animosity to pretty much all people doing better than me and can function better. I'm just complaining over and over again. Nobody wants to be around me cause I have bad energy and can't hold a conversation with really anyone. Sometimes I take ADHD meds under the table to only feel like 50% normal for like 10 minutes then the high fades and I'm slow and stupid again. I hardly doubt it's PAWS anymore. Wtf is that shit when I already had these symptoms since I started smoking. I feel like this is permanent. I'm definitely not my old self. Probably all that feel the same. I know. I need to see a psych doc and stop rambling on here wasting others times. Sorry

It's not much really, but it's a lot for me, and damn if it isn't a long time coming. I've been wavering a bit in the last week or so, craving the familiar escape. Telling myself familiar fairy tales.

If I can space it out like this. If I can do it only under a certain set of ideal circumstances (that just so happen to be present tonight, right now--whaddya know!). If I can restrict myself to twice a month, once a month, once a year, once a decade. That hungry little gremlin inside will agree to anything, won't he? Feed me first, he hisses. We'll talk logistics in the morning.

I thought instead of giving in and getting back on the Mary Go Round, I'd make an alt account and do some anonymous public self-reflection instead. Here are some things I've learned.

* **I'm becoming convinced that the Solution** can be boiled down to two complementary disciplines: mindfulness and stoicism. When the green gremlin starts producing an itch, the important things are to look at it directly, inquire where it's coming from, and to be *ok* with feeling itchy for awhile. It is not an Urgent Emergency that must be immediately squelched, but instead an ultimately harmless (if unpleasant) state that will pass of its own accord. Feel it. Name it. Endure it. There are plenty of worse feelings I could be having right now.
* **Since doing the above is capital-fucking-H Hard** during moments of weakness, depression, stress, and self-pity, it's been really helpful to have some non-substance means of jolting myself out of the itchy state. The most reliable thing is exercise. Running, jumping rope, and strength training (weights or calisthenics), are all pretty effective. The key is to avoid excuses. Even if it's the middle of the night and raining, I *know* that if I go out there and do burpees until I'm wobbly, my mood will be significantly improved, and as a bonus, I'll sleep better after.
* **Even better than any of those**, but harder to line up on demand, is something I've taken up very recently: surfing. It's the closest thing to a drug-level high that I've experienced from a physical activity. It leaves a sense of well-being and a literal body high that remains strong for hours, gradually trailing off into the next day. And you get the high even being terrible at it! If you have waves nearby, I highly recommend it. You can get everything you need as a beginner (foamie board, wetsuit, soft rack for the car) for around $500. Not cheap exactly, but neither is being a pothead.
* **On the flip side**, I think it's just as important to recognize behaviors that offer temporary relief without a sustained psycho-physiological lift. I find that these tend to make the hole deeper and the itch worse. In this realm I'd place jerking off, binge-watching shows, playing addictive video games, eating tasty but unhealthy food, and mindlessly scrolling online. When squaring off with the gremlin, it's a lot better to bite the bullet and do something that may be harder but actually works.
* **The touchstone for quitting**, for me, is looking into my 2 year old daughter's eyes. I've been stoned around her plenty, but as she got older and more aware, I started to realize that she could notice the difference. She could tell that something had changed. That something was off with Papa. I never want her or me to have that feeling again. That's my touchstone, the thing I keep going back to when I'm hanging by a thread. That's not the father I want to be. She deserves better.
* **Weed isn't the root cause.** It was easy when I was getting high constantly to blame the weed for  my various shortcomings. It was the reason I was procrastinating and not getting enough work done. The reason I wasn't sleeping well. The cause of conflict in my marriage. The reason I wasn't reading books anymore. The reason I was losing touch with friends and couldn't connect with people. The reason I felt anxious or depressed or stressed out. But while it didn't *help* with any of those things, it wasn't the cause either. I'm still dealing with all that fun stuff. For the first month or so after quitting, even though it was hard at times, I also felt sort of ebullient, like a big weight had been lifted. It was like a honeymoon phase of sobriety. I reveled in my newfound mental sharpness and stability. But I'm learning that just like the honeymoon phase of weed itself, it wears off, and the monotonous reality sets in. Weed is not a layer of oil atop a diamond-studded life. It's a layer of oil atop another layer of oil. But the diamonds are down there somewhere.

Well today was February 1st, and my girlfriend (who did dry January with me) and I decide to go for a happy hour at a local outdoor spot with a fire pit. All was well, had 2 beers, but when i got back to my house and sat down to edit some video (aerial photography) and I had the same distracted feeling I got when I used to smoke and try to ""work on my art"".

Have I become so accustomed to sobriety and having energy to work on my various art forms that I can't drink and enjoy it anymore? I got the same feeling of distraction and anxiety I would get when I smoked and lost the motivation or ability to think critically and work on creative projects, except I definitly didn't smoke. I think quitting herb and alcohol at the same time linked the two in some way, and now when I drink a beer or two I get the same feeling of brain fog like I smoked. I never thought I would stop smoking herb, and never thought I would or could quit cigarettes, and never thought I linked alcohol with those two things, but im laying here trying to fall asleep and have the same guilt hanging over me like I relapsed and failed at my goal of cannabis sobriety even though all I did was have a few beers.

I equated herb with beer somehow cause I quit em both at the same time, and can't see myself enjoying drinking if it brings up these kinds of emotions I associated with failing at quitting the ganja.

Anyone else have an experience like this? I know this is alcohol talk, but its bringing up old emotions I felt everything I would relapse with weed and I just need to known if I'm alone in this experience.

Started smoking chronically at 16 after being introduced the year before, and consistently made up other reasons for my problems than the dope. I always thought of myself as a pretty quick-witted person but over the course of a few years, it totally felt like I'd lost the sharpness I once had and never really attributed it to anything in particular. I went to a super urban highschool in California where sparking up daily was not only common, it was the norm. I had totally indoctrinated myself into the idea that weed is purely medicine and I couldn't possibly be doing myself any harm. My main social activities were getting high with buddies which inevitably turned into just getting high by myself. Early 2020 I started moking regularly just to feel something again and after months of having no aspirations in life and being regularly suicidal, I knew something had to change.

That summer I gave it up, and felt better than I ever had, yet after a buddy offered to light up on Thanksgiving night, I found myself using regularly again. I had tricked myself that it was a special occasion and that I was a changed man, (I wasn't). Smoked almost every day of December and felt myself falling back into the hole. After I reflected on how shitty my life had felt when I smoked everyday, I pledged to only smoke on weekends and treat it how I treat drinking. I began using my phone way less and really try and breathe in life. To no surprise, I've begun to feel like a little kid again, the things I love doing I have actually started to love again. I've felt so good and happy about my place in life and the future ahead of me that I thought: a little toke to celebrate can't hurt eh?

   But after smoking a few bowls this past weekend I've started craving the daily use of it again despite now knowing how pointless it is, and how shitty it made me feel. It's really put into perspective how serious my addiction had become, and how much it truly controlled me. Like many others, I'm in the process of taking that power back but would love some advice and/or someone's 2¬¢ on how they made it out and continued to fight off the itches.

2021-02-01 23:53:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lanu32/the_end_of_another_day_1/,The End of Another Day 1,"This is my third Day 1 in as many years and it wasn't so bad this time. Before that, I was a daily consumer of marijuana for about a decade. I started at the end of my senior year in high school and didn't look back until I turned 30. At the age of 18, I never imagined I'd be a ""pothead"" into my 30's and was most surprised when I got there and found myself helplessly attached to it. Along the way, I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything, or that it was destroying my relationships. In a sense, I now believe both of those things happened but not in a ""rock bottom"" kind of way. I justified my energy level by saying things like ""I don't have to be a marathon runner or world-class violinist to be happy; I'll be good with some laughs, tunes, and money in the pocket."" Now I'm realizing that no, I don't have to be a marathon runner, but I had better start treating my body with respect or it's not going to be there for me as I get older. I'm also realizing that my markers for happiness weren't actually enough for me to find the kind of fulfillment I'm really looking for: I want to experience the highs and lows of my life without an additional filter or layer to view them through. Instead of chasing happiness, I want to pursue clarity. 

I don't want to put blame anywhere else but myself for allowing my relationship with weed to get out of hand, but I can say marijuana is a helluva a drug. I've been able to quit using other substances with much less effort--specifically alcohol and tobacco--but I also always knew in my core that neither of those drugs made me feel anywhere near the level of attachment that weed does. From almost the first toke, I started to reorganize my life and my relationships to allow for weed to have a bigger role in it. It's hard to admit this but one of the actual reasons I selected the college I ended up attending was because it was known for having high-quality weed and a lenient campus culture. Reflecting on it now, that same reputation might explain why I hated my time there so much, but I wasn't ready to admit that to myself back then. I also moved far away from family (for a number of reasons) but one of the top ones was that I didn't want any of them to see what my day-to-day looked like; I would've found it too embarrassing to tolerate. 

Once my routine of smoking/vaping all the time began, it really didn't stop until I got to the point where I knew I had to quit for good, and that there wouldn't be a way for me to have a ""casual"" relationship with marijuana. I think that moment came about 3 years ago now, and it was brought on by fairly-frequent anxiety attacks: I wouldn't be able to eat for multiple days sometimes and I was struggling to maintain my focus at work in a way that I've never had a problem with before. At first I thought the weed was *helping* the anxiety attacks but now I'm 100% sure it's the source. I know because once I decided to quit those three years ago, I started feeling great after about a week, and the anxiety attacks started to diminish until finally disappearing altogether. But this was kind of a trap, because I still had genuine love for weed, and regretted that I couldn't use it. After maybe 3 months, my brain was pumping out all sorts of thoughts like, ""you can be an occasional smoker; just when there's something worth celebrating"" and, ""weed just isn't addictive. You had a bad relationship with it before but now that you're out on the other side, you'll be fine."" 

Spoiler: I was not fine. I mean, I was f.i.n.e. (fucked up, insecure, neurotic, emotional) but I fell right back into my previous weed routine almost immediately. Didn't even take a full week. At that point, I just consigned myself to the fact that I would be a forever-pot-user, like Snoop Dogg or Willie Nelson. For a very brief time, I even thought that might be okay: ""everyone's got their vice! At least this one isn't as destructive as the others!"" But my anxieties resurfaced a lot faster this time--instead of taking years for it to develop, it took weeks. Around this time, I was also looking for a new job and found it easier to quit smoking weed when I knew it would mean more/better employment opportunities. Then once I got the great new job, I found it easy to stick with ""staying quit"" because the job required so much of my energy and focus, and I didn't have the bandwidth to be groggy or low-energy. Months went by like this and I hardly thought about weed. Then I started making friends with my colleagues and it became pretty clear that many of them smoked weed, sometimes just as much as I was used to smoking. Some of those people were in positions above me, even. Living in a legal state, this shouldn't really have surprised me, but it did. I was like ""well, if my colleagues (and bosses!) can do it then I should be *fine!*"" (there's that word again) 

With all of that said, here I am...again. I know now that I'm not my best self when I consume marijuana and, since I've got some long streaks of sobriety under my belt, I have the evidence to back it up. I feel so much more well-rounded and capable when I'm not sticking a vape pen in my mouth every 20 minutes. I'm a better family member, a better spouse, and a better friend. I'm better at holding myself accountable, and setting goals that I then achieve. The longer I keep those things at the front of my mind, the better I feel. I'm ready to give it my best shot and I'm grateful to r/leaves for always being here as a resource to keep me from feeling so isolated in the journey. I still have a lot of guilt, shame, and embarrassment about how much weed I've consumed in my life, so it's almost impossible to express how great it is to have a judgement-free place to share. Even though I'm expecting this to be a challenging process, I'm ready to face it with the belief that I can live the rest of my life comfortably without weed in it!

 I don't need to smoke to - celebrate - unwind - manage pain for endometriosis - lower stress & anxiety. Because after this many years it just heightens all the bad. All the pain. For me, weed just makes it worse.

I realized that I was pushing food too hard, and needed an ER to help me re-hydrate via IV (honestly, I should have gone in sooner to get tests/processes rolling earlier in the past week.)

My energy is improving. Sure, I have hunger headaches, but staring at reddit/screens all day for distraction probably isn't helping lol. I'm using ice packs to soothe my head, avoiding taking anything unnecessary (advil, tylenol, etc) to give my stomach a break.

Food is no longer running right through me -- my stomach is holding onto soup broth. Now when I smell food, I often get HUNGRY. Sweet lord, I am so hungry and jealous of what my roommate is eating. My appetite has returned! (But I will not push my stomach farther than it can go -- I'm listening to my body first & foremost.)

A nurse in the ER said something that stuck with me: *""one ice chip at a time.""* (She gave me ice chips, & then proceeded to explain why hospitals do that. It's not to skimp on water, or specifically because they're cold -- it's because you're supposed to suck on one at a time.) So that's my mantra. One ice chip at a time.

It gets better, it's just slow & painful. It's also harder than ever, what with hospitals turning away patients/discharging certain conditions earlier due to covid/other priorities. But don't do it alone -- find someone you trust to keep in the loop, and reach out to emergency services if you need to.

Even with this pandemic and stressful time we live in. 

I have been having constant headaches, extreme fatigue and cold sweats for the past 7 days... I went for a Covid test Saturday, results came back negative yesterday.

So I decided to go get myself checked at the ER this morning. Got a lot of testing done, blood, urine, X-ray and scan. They can't find anything wrong with me. Except maybe that my sinuses are clogged, the doc prescribed me some cortisone nasal spray to see if it would help with my headaches.

But I don't think my sinuses are the cause of all of this... my sinuses don't feel that clogged up.

I have been a long time heavy concentrates user/abuser, morning till night kinda deal.

Usually everytime I stop it gets really hard at the one month mark. Headaches, night sweats, stress, depression, insomnia, vivid nightmares, etc. So usually I end up giving in to try and alleviate these symptoms. But I don't want to cave in this time.

I told the doc at the ER about quiting cannabis 5 weeks ago, he said; No, 5 weeks is a long time it shouldn't be bothering you now...

So I called my Psychiatrist and told him everything, he prescribed me something to ease my stress, and also medication for my nightmares. I did not know that this existed, one big reason for my cannabis addiction is to not have these constant nightmares where I don't feel rested at all when I wake up. He says that i have  had post traumatic experiences in my life and the medication should stop me from having these nightmares. I am thinking the lack of good sleep might have to do with why I always feel tired and have headaches.

So I guess what I am asking is this, do you guys still feel withdrawals like cold sweats, tiredness, restless sleep and headaches even after 5 weeks or more quiting cold turkey?

The cravings have gone, the headaches seem to have gone, the mood swings disappeared, and I'm feeling so much more stable, happy, and free! 

I used to love weed and probably still do, but after years of smoking, it got to a point where I couldn't imagine going a day without it, I didn't know who or how I would be if I didn't smoke. Six weeks later and I can confidently say I'm beginning to meet myself again, the excited self, the non-anxious self, the awesome person I used to know. I can think clearly about things, about who I am, what I want in life. And it is really exciting to realign myself with my interests, hobbies, goals, and less so with simply getting high and having a good time. Sure, that's great, but it wears off after a while and life is far too short to miss out on such a vivid and shimmering world. 

I used to think weed helped me stay productive, stave off anxiety/boredom, be more sociable, but I now see that while I was able to do those things stoned, it was as if I was being held back by it. My addiction was telling me I needed it to operate at Max potential, when in reality it was keeping me at 60% or lower, and making me think that was the top. Don't know if that makes sense, but now I can feel way more space to expand and grow as a human on an emotional, psychological, and intellectual level!

But I somehow could binge eat at night and never really gain much. Now I‚Äôve quit and although I definitely eat a bit more throughout the day, I‚Äôm trying to be healthier.

I've got to make this work. If I get this right, my life will change drastically. It's not ok to carry on living this way, I must make the change. 

You see, 7 years ago, I had it all. A beautiful home, a marriage, a healthy body, a happy child, a stable career. But my world came crashing down around me when my husband found warmth in the arms of another. 

At 16 and inseperable, we had grand plans. Married at 21, we jetted off to the other side of the world with nothing but our suitcases and a bit of cash in our pockets. Though we had no jobs, no home, no money, we were the happiest we would ever be together.

Before long, we both were earning a decent wage. Dean always worked away, usually a week at a time, 2 weeks or so a month. Our lives revolved around his ever changing schedule and thirst for building a solid foundation for our future. We wiled away the years, knocking down walls, building new ones, making everything look just so. We never went away, we were working so hard to create a beautiful home, we couldn't justify it. Resentment began to fester,  creeping into our lives so slowly it was barely noticeable. 

After our son was born, the cracks began to show. I'd be making dinner and look at the knife, imagine plunging it inside myself just to end it all. I'd be driving home from work on an empty road and contemplate swerving off into a tree. But then I'd look up from cooking dinner, or pull into nursery, and see my son's face and know I needed to be here for him. Post natal depression had been hard, but being mocked for it by the person who I needed the most was devastating. And I was getting sicker. I was ill all the time, headaches, sniffles, aches and pains. I'd go to the doctors again and again but they kept sending me away with a prescription for antibiotics or instructions to rest up. Any signs of being sick at home was met with a sarcastic ""do we need to call an ambulance?""

By the time the found the tumour, it had filled so much of one side of my sinuses it perforated the cartilage in the middle. It pushed up past my eye into my forehead. It took two surgeries to fix and the removal of my entire left sinus, leaving nerves exposed to this day. My loving husband couldn't find the time to pick me up after surgery, he was working on his boat, so my friend picked me up. I was back home looking after our 2 year old son less than 24 hours after both operations. Dean would have helped, of course, but the boat really needed just one more thing doing. Just one..

There was always one more thing.

I began pushing to move home. As my health declined and our son grew, I craved to be closer to family. We had always planned to move back but it was complicated after all the work we had put in here. Dean agreed we should move back, that it would be better for our family, and so we prepared to go. Then he changed his mind. He just couldn't throw away all we had built here. And so began a game of give and take. We argued, discussed, planned yet it became clearer and clearer we were on opposite sides. It drove a bigger wedge between us but I was determined we would get through this. I would work on my health and things would be good again.

Dean had always been the leader of our relationship. I was content in leaving the weight of decision making to him. He once admitted to me that he knew how to get me to agree things, how to wind me up, how to make me act, and he did it on purpose. But over the years, after he'd been working away so much and I'd been running the house, I'd become stronger, more independent. I was confident in making decisions without him. I was able to manage a team professionally, could organise pretty much anything we needed doing at home and was the only one able to keep our social lives going. I was happy, managing everything so well. Dean had been pushing for this for years, always getting so angry and berating or mocking me if I came across as weak or forgetful. 

I thought he'd be pleased, I would finally be the wife he always wanted me to be. I couldn't believe how wrong I was.

In high school, I never got high during or before school because I wanted to be able to fully participate in class. When corona hit that all changed because suddenly I didn‚Äôt have to be physically present anymore. 

I started college this fall and I ended up leaving campus after two months pretty much because I stopped taking care of myself. The only thing that kept me going was weed and when I didn‚Äôt have it, I was all alone in a new environment with no friends and no motivation to make any. It was the absolute worst two months of my life - and I‚Äôm largely attributing that to the anxiety, sluggishness, and numbness that came from daily cannabis use and the incredible mood swings and depression that came from quitting.

Needless to say, I am terrified of returning to campus next year in a similar state and I don‚Äôt want to have to depend on a substance to be mentally stable anymore. Today is day 2 of my sobriety. The cravings haven‚Äôt been awful but I do think about weed a lot still. I‚Äôm afraid that my sleep will only get worse before it gets better and I know I will be agitated for the next week or so. 

I just can‚Äôt do this anymore. I miss the old me.

I am on day 25 of my latest sobriety journey, and I have a question for you all. I know that having vivid dreams / nightmares is a common side-effect of withdrawal, but I have been having something slightly different and I wanted to pick your minds on this.

The first two weeks getting clean, I had the ever-familiar nightmares that had me waking up in cold sweats in the middle of the night, but those have since subsided. Instead, they have been replaced by dreams that are so vivid it seems as though I am awake versus the cloudy-dreamlike landscape I am used to. The result is me waking up everyday feeling as though I have gotten absolutely zero sleep. 

Most days I can fight it, but today I have this insurmountable brain fog that I cannot shake off for the life of me. Have any of you felt this as well? Any words of advice you could offer? I am craving a good night's sleep like nobody's business and I have quite a few job interviews coming up and I don't want to risk being in the clouds when an important opportunity is on the line.

That was very rarely and over the years it started only weekends but it turned out daily during college. Everything was awesome until last year when I noticed my libido was very low and got to the point when I would think about smoking while my gf was naked next to me.

Decided it was time to stop, but having a new job was also part of decision. I've been sober 2 months and noticed anxiety in the morning and before falling to sleep, but I reduced it by exercising.

After 2 months I relapsed and continued to smoke for the next 3 weeks. Anxiety was soaring and libido was low again so I decided to stop again but this time I got to 100th day. Libido is now normal and hardcore anxiety was present during first 30 days.

Anxiety is now still present but nowhere near like at the beginning. I was taking some anxiety medications perscribed by doctor for 2 weeks and still **exercising 3 times per week**, combined with a lot of **fruit and vegetables**. I tried **to meditate** and it turned out to be great solution for anxiety.

Every day is contant pain. I also had a bad drug addiction what w.e else i could get my hands on. 

I'm now off the heavy stuff and have a stable relationship and career with a young small business. 

I use the pot to help with pain of course and it definitely helps however its become a crutch. I get stuff more suited for pain but find it never helps as much as hybrid stuff. I think I'm mostly being distracted from the pain rather then it actually dulling the pain. 

Now before i pretty much do anything i grab a toke. Usually from a one hitter but it adds up quick. 

Over the years its become a ha not to smoke before i do anything. Cooking? Better smoke. Gonna work of a project, do laundry shower?? Better toke first. This mindset has me now burning 1-2G a day from a one hitter and half the time i never do the thing i want to do. If i don't smoke the moment i get home its the only thing i can think of. What's crazy is that I'm not a bored person. I have lots of interest and hobbies and run a business working with wood and leather and i love making stuff. But iv barely been able to motivate myself to do these things consistently. I take care of my disabled partner which includes cooking cleaning and errands. Every day is a battle for allocating my energy and feeling sad that i didn't do more at the end of the day only to repeat everyday. 

I know it's affecting my relationship because while I'm normally high energy and inspired and get very quiet and internal when i smoke changing how i interact with my partner. It's turned me into a zombie and i know if i keep this up I'll just waste away more years of my life being burnt. 

Idk what the point of this is but I need change and maybe saying it to the world will make me actually do it this time.

I'll be 30 years old in may and I want to start this new chapter clean and sober. 

This weekend I smoked with my friends the last few joints knowing that today will be my first day. I also wanted to talk about something in particular about weed addiction. Weed, over time, killed my intuition or instinct, I don't know what word is more appropriate here. I always was in instinctif person and I would listen to my instinct to get out of trouble or not even get in trouble to begin with. But, over time, it seems like I don't have that anymore. It's like that part of me doesn't exist anymore. 

Also, I'm tired of hiding my consumption to people around me. I feel like a liar but at the same time, I don't want people to find out. In the long run, it took a lot of my confidence. It felt like I was lying to myself also.

Anything can be addictive from food to sports so don't listen to people who says weed is not addictive. Sometimes I think about my 20's and wish I could go back and do things differently but, at the same time, I think it was meant to happen so I can learn from it all. What I know today: I want to be free like a bird. Free from addiction, free from debts, free from negative people ect. Most importantly, I want to be free in my mind.

I had pretty crazy withdrawal symptoms for the first month or so (depression, major crying spells, appetite gone, so much anxiety), but once I was out of that I was so grateful to be sober. I realized after a while that I wasn‚Äôt even missing weed. If I missed anything it was having a beer with friends.

I wasn‚Äôt going to smoke but I ended up taking a toke of weed camping and felt so uncomfortably high that I immediately regretted smoking. The next day I was kinda happy about it because it didn‚Äôt make me crave weed again. 

   But then my dumbass bought a joint the next week to just have when I‚Äôm alone. Of course I smoked it and remembered why I loved weed, because I was alone and able to vibe by myself. This was my mistake because I have not gone a day without smoking since...once again.  

   I‚Äôve read this a lot on here but it‚Äôs so true! Once you‚Äôre high you can‚Äôt stop thinking about being sober and once your sober you only want to get high.

I'm 32 and started when I was 15.  Smoked a bit in high school, a fuck ton in college, like every day, then a good bit after graduating until last December.  My real addiction is porn and masturbating and for the past few years, every time I would get high I would either get really anxious if I hadn't smoked in awhile (weed is way too strong these days) or just super horny and wanted to get somewhere where I could just be alone and watch porn and masturbate for hours.  

My close group of friends all smoke and a couple of them are huge potheads.  Two of them are married to each other and the wife will roll like an entire cigarette case worth of joints anytime she goes over to our other friends to smoke.  Just constantly smoking joints and she claims it's for her anxiety but I don't even think she realizes she has anxiety because of how much she smokes, not the other way around.  But enough talking shit about my friends. 

I went to a birthday party back the first weekend of December and smoked a blunt with some people.  That was the last time I smoked.  I woke up the next day with Covid (not from them).  I felt like shit for all of December basically and decided to lay off weed and drinking until I felt better.  New Year came around and I decided to just quit weed for good.  I've been wanting to quit for awhile because I know it makes quitting porn really difficult whenever I get high with them and come home.  I'm a big craft beer fan too and I even did dry January as well.

I've read in a lot of other posts that this is normal, but I'm lacking total motivation to do ANYTHING that I liked doing before (like crafting and jewelry making). I've heard it comes back for some but I'm afraid it won't for me. My anxiety is also quite intense today, I keep thinking I'll have to break up with my partner because they smoke. Honestly, and I don't talk about this a lot because I'm afraid people will think I'm crazy, but I'm pretty sure I'm an undiagnosed mild to moderate OCD case - for reasons I'm not entirely willing to share here. When we first began dating I had a lot of relationship anxiety symptoms that quickly turned to OCD symptoms - I would lay down in a panic for hours and just ruminate on the same thoughts over and over again. It was frightening and debilitating. 

I know the anxiety/OCD isn't neccesarily related to weed (I've ALWAYS been a worrier, ever since I was a child) but it feels good to get it out. For people to know and to see me. I used to see this therapist that really did a number on my head. She was a great lady, don't get me wrong, but when I shared this with her her answer was always to ""Look inside yourself"" and ""Use your intuition"". While I'm better at doing those things NOW. at the time I was like ""That's the problem! I can't! I can't access the inside of myself because its a crazy mess and I don't know what to think!"" (For anyone wondering, my partner is   an awesome and supportive person and apart from some irritating idiosyncrysies and being flawed in some ways as every human being on this planet is, I hope to marry him someday). 

Anyway, the point is my anxiety is REALLY up today and doing its best to attack those things I care about deeply. I'm not a fan of journaling because I have trouble trusting how I feel in any one moment. A part of me thinks I should be happy all the time, but the intuitive part of me that I've worked on and can trust knows that's absolutely ridiculous. That part knows that most days are like any other day, that it's okay not to be very up or very down but just content. 

When I get into these anxious states I feel all alone and crazy. Any words of encouragement will help, and yes, I know its not the ""right"" thing to do but I am asking the community to validate my anxiety. To reality check me. I know I shouldn't, so I'm sorry and don't feel obliged. But I'm going to ask anyway because it might just help me get through this one day a little better.

I can't tolerate smoking even though I try every once in awhile, the come down from being ""high"" - disconnected from the body, as weed is actually a depressant, the mechanism being depressing the signals coming from your body - from being disconnected to then reconnecting to my body, to the pain, trying to ground again into pain - it's just too agitating.

I've tried just trying to be constantly high too, but my executive function is already fucked from the pain, and so being high makes that worse.

I know I'm going to end up killing myself soon, there's not been any significant help from health care system here, and the stromal stem cell treatment that had successful human clinical trials in India (research from animal model research done at University of Pittsburgh) likely won't be available for 2-5 years - I have nothing that helps me get through each day. I've only ever been given opiates for 2-3 days after procedures I've had done, it made my days quite easy to get through, but because of opiate epidemic no doctor has wanted to allow me to try opiates longer term, I guess due to liabilities.

Anyway, just wanted to share LASIK really fucked me up - there's a pending Canadian class action lawsuit against them; 40% of people who do LASIK have permanent negative effects afterward, one of the FDA advisors who voted to approve it in 2011 asked the FDA to recall LASIK, and said it should have never been approved because there was data they were ignoring that they shouldn't have ignored.

My dad died 4 years ago pretty horrifically, his last wish was for me and my sister to make sure my mom's taken care of - so I moved back recently to help her empty out the house she's been living in that's been cluttered with junk from last 20+ years, never finished - still the builder's stairs, no hardwood flooring or tiles are down, no proper kitchen installed - to be here to help her empty it out and get a designer and work started on it so she has a proper place to retire. Then I'm out. Had to put my dog of 15 years down 3 years ago too. I don't get the purpose of my life path, the multi-generational trauma that gets passed on has certainly caught up and reached its peak though.

The executive dysfunction is making it hard for me to understand if any of what I wrote violates the rules - please forgive me if so and don't block this post, I won't end up posting it again, too mentally exhausted already today, just venting.

Edit to add: I try to distract myself from the pain every day as best I can, to try to progress in life, but the executive dysfunction basically stops me in my tracks - I tried to ask questions to then be able to put a new PC together so I could maybe stream and play video games and chat with people, to try to not be so isolated and build an online community of regular viewers, but I can't even move forward with that - it just gets too complicated, too many pieces and steps for me to keep track of. Life's too hard, thankfully I think I'm straight minded enough that I will be sober once I end things, I'd prefer to be sharp minded with my decision.",4,{'epidemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.91082174}"

2021-02-01 11:21:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/la6zld/ama_been_smoke_free_for_nearly_10_years_and_would/,[AMA] Been smoke free for nearly 10 years and would to share my experiences with removing this addiction from my life,"I would like to preface by giving a little background about myself and my history with THC. 

Demographic: I am a 30 year old male. Smoke free for nearly 10 years (can't remember the exact date). Currently living a life I didn't even think was possible for me. I'm married, in a career, own a home which is huge in its own way, but moreso given where my life was heading as an addict. 

Experience with THC addiction:
My time using was definitely not as long as some people I have met (3 years) but it was in fact very violent. I was addicted to nicotine, opiates, and THC and honestly ot was thc that had me the tightest. 
Weed always seemed like something more harmless than drinking even, It was easy to get most of the time, and was cheap at first until tolerance kicked in. 
Over the years everyone around me could see me transforming into a different person. My ambitions, energy, and even personality were slowly dying to the point to where no one could recognize me anymore (including myself). At first it seemed like this new addition to an already interesting life but over time addiction had drained every ounce of humanity I had. 
By the time I had quit I: was not able to hold a job (which made getting my daily high difficult), unable to feel anything from regs no matter how much I smoked (which made getting my daily high expensive), resorted to stealing from my parents every single day just enough to get high first money and then anything I could sell (which made getting my daily high cost killing a part of me every time).

Quitting:
Quitting for me was a combination of forced to and wanting to. When I was 20 years I was involved in an accident that ultimately led to me doing 3 years in prison. This accounts for most of the forced to, but didn't entirely remove the option for me. This is also the reason I do not know my exact quit date as my stubborn ass was still trying to get high in jail. Jail or prison didn't make getting high impossible, just extremely risky and difficult which leads me to the ""want to"".
I remember distinctly the few times I had tried smoking while locked up. Every time was an absolute train wreck of paranoia and self loathing. When I transfered to prison weed was a little harder to get and K2 was the big thing. I'll mention this experience because it helped fuel my decision to quit. I remember geeking out..hard..felt like I was going to die quite literally. I climbed into my bunk and was feeling horrible. The whole time, the people that got me on this train were sitting there laughing at me. I remember in that moment I had said to myself "" I know these guys. These guys are fucking losers. I was these guys for a long time and that's not who I am anymore"". And that was when I decided I was done with all of that crap.

Staying sober: 
this is where I imagine a lot of the questions (if I get any) will hang around. Staying clean for so long despite availability and having the means to get it. Honestly, this is the challenging part for a long time. There have been times where it's been in my face, available, and everywhere in between. It definitely has not always been easy for me but here are some of the things I have found in my experience. 
1. The first phase of quitting is the hardest. It's almost like a severed limb in shock. You are still there and around everything and everyone that got you there or facilitated the addiction. You have to resolve to close these loops. Don't try to change people that haven't committed to make the same journey as you. It never works. I've had to distance myself from old friends and people that cared about me but weren't on the same wavelength. It's hard. It's messy. It's vital to staying clean.  
2. The second phase for me was much like fear. I don't recommend setting out to be in this place intentionally but it did happen for me. It started as feeling like if I ever smoked again I would go back to everything I left behind and that progressed to immediate flight mode if I saw anyone with weed or if it was around me. 
3. The next part was also challenging for me. Figuring out who I am and who I want to be without this on my life. I think we all struggle with a sense of self sometimes but with addiction it seems to be a crutch keeping you from addressing who you are and ultimately becoming your identity. In order for me to really move on, I had to figure out who I was and wanted to be and what the path to get there looks like. 
4. The stage I am currently at right now is building a life around the person that you have decided to be. Put people, places, and things in your love that fill the void that is left behind. Things that actually bring you fulfillment. These things are your inspiration, testimony, and goal. The reason you are doing all this for. A good climate brings out the best in you and that helps making the decision to be clean be a lot easier.

I feel absolutely stuck. I‚Äôve been been smoking daily as a wake n baker ( and throughout the day)for almost two years. I can‚Äôt function without weed and can‚Äôt go more than 2 hours without rolling another blunt. The longest break I take from smoking is the 8 hours I spend sleeping. I‚Äôm 21 (female). I buy weed almost daily and throwing my stuff out doesn‚Äôt help, neither does trying to manage the time of day I‚Äôll smoke. I‚Äôll just fish it right back out the trash (even public places) or buy more. I feel like a full blown addicted fiend. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the next time I‚Äôll get high or calculate in my head exactly how I can manage to get more weed. I bursted into tears last night (literally) after trying to quit. since I have the habit of waking and baking it‚Äôs literally the first thing I think about. I can‚Äôt stop the thoughts and have quite literally 0 will to do anything but smoke. 

Reason I smoke? 
It started as a fun thing to do on the weekend (famous  words lol), to smoking before classes in college with a friend some mornings, to almost daily with other ‚Äúfriends‚Äù in the evenings, to eventually smoking by myself daily as a wake n baker for almost 2 years now.  It‚Äôs such a comfort to me. It allows me to be in solitude and literally not care about the fact that my life sucks. Pretty much have no one to talk to about what I‚Äôm going through. I Have no friends (I‚Äôve always been the ‚Äúside‚Äù friend and never had a real best friend). Actions of friends and even cousins show they never respect me as a person, and literally every friend I‚Äôve never has talked shit behind my back. I basically I keep everything to myself as I literally have no one I trust who I feel won‚Äôt judge me (or tell someone else). Plus no one even checks on me anyways LOL. I try not to think about how friends and family have made feel and situations that I wish I could change. But hey it is what it is, I can‚Äôt change how people treat me. Weed helped me to be okay with being alone, literally and emotionally. 

So now that I can‚Äôt smoke i feel empty inside yet have so many emotions which just makes me cry. I feel alone and sad and i just don‚Äôt know how to move forward from these past feelings. Weed would just make me stop thinking and caring about it. Now I just have to sit here being sad about things that I can‚Äôt even change. Besides starting online classes this week, I have nothing to do, no one to talk to, and now not even any weed to smoke. 

Sorry for the long post. I just needed to finally get that off my chest. Any advice helps (Especially for waking n baking). Also please recommend any books, movies, groups, or chats that help with this addiction journey.",24,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7010753}"

r/trueoffmychest post.  Also sorry in advance for the mobile format, it‚Äôs the only way I use Reddit without a laptop. 

Today I am 28 days free from weed and I honestly cannot believe it. An all day user for 7 years, I decided to quit because I am starting a farm which my family is involved in and I don‚Äôt want to let them down by not being 100% focused. Also getting married at the end of the year and we know we are going to start trying for a baby so I‚Äôd rather solidify healthy sober habits than trying to quit and get pregnant at same time. 

The first couple of weeks were rough but I happened to be off work during the same time so I was able to basically hide in my room when I needed to which I think made a huge difference in staying sober. 

Since I‚Äôve quit I‚Äôve realized weed is responsible for all the things I hated about myself- anxiety, low self esteem, questioning how my partner feels about me and more. I honestly had no idea how much it contributed to the negative in my life. I feel like I‚Äôm my old self again, but new all at the same time. I am so happy I decided to do this and follow through. The amount of energy I have now is also incredible! Dating my SO for 4 years I hadn‚Äôt stayed awake for an entire movie. Now we‚Äôve gone through half the Marvel catalogue and I‚Äôve stayed awake and engaged for every single one of them!

I‚Äôll be honest, I had a slip up last week to see if maaaaaybe I could ever return to weed in a more recreational or social capacity. I‚Äôm glad I did it because immediately I knew it was no longer for me. Headache, nausea, paranoia, just awful. This is a 100% sober journey for me all the way and I‚Äôm okay with that. (Hope that blurb isn‚Äôt against the sub rules) 

Although I can now go throughout my day without pot crossing my mind I know it‚Äôs an ongoing journey I‚Äôll have to keep with for a while, if not the rest of my life. 

I am so thankful to my friends and family who supported me and believed I could do it. I‚Äôm thankful for my 73 year old mother who quit smoking and drinking at the same time. I‚Äôm thankful for a sober app community im a part of  who literally held me up when I felt like I was breaking. I‚Äôm thankful my partner gave me the love and space I needed to get through this. I‚Äôm just so thankful for everything.

I hope whoever reads this has a great rest of the day. I‚Äôm excited to be a part of this community now and look forward to connecting with you! 

Lots of love, M.

2021-02-01 09:27:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/la48bg/what_really_helped_me_quit_and_worked/,What really helped me quit and worked,"Hi all

I‚Äôm always looking for/reading posts on reddit about various things in search of advice. Found this community 6 months late but hoping I can give back to some of you that might be struggling with what helped me. 

I smoked weed in total for around 10 years to varying extents, but for the last 2 years or so I was smoking a ridiculous amount - as in 3-4 king skin sized spliffs a day. Got to the point that being sober was weirder than being high eventually. 

Here‚Äôs probably the biggest and best piece of advice imo (and can probably be applied to quitting or starting any habit): try and try again! 

I didn‚Äôt quit in one foul swoop. Though there came a day on which I smoked my last spliff and I‚Äôve been off it for 6 months since, the actual process took me probably 8 or 9 months of trying. Quitting addictions is kind of a skill in itself, I think. 

I‚Äôm not saying you should go into it expecting to fail - you should absolutely commit to not being a weed smoker if that‚Äôs what you want - you to commit to the idea and be consciously working towards it. But, if you‚Äôve been smoking daily for say 2 years, it takes time to rewire and it‚Äôll probably take multiple attempts. 

I‚Äôve heard similar things said about quitting cigarettes - those who do succeed usually have to try several times. So if you slip up - whether it‚Äôs a couple of tokes with a mate on a Friday night or you fall back into it full time for a month, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and do it again. You‚Äôre not starting from scratch - that time you‚Äôve spent away from it contributes to the rewiring in my experience. Figure out what went wrong and why you slipped up and go again. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up, just get back to it! 

Another note I‚Äôll make on that point is that it might not always feel like an upward trajectory - I kept track of how many days I kept off it at a time (I would recommend doing that plus journaling too) and it didn‚Äôt always stack up longer and longer each time. Sometimes I‚Äôd go a month, slip up, back off for a week, slip up again. Generally the trend was upwards over time, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt a straight line. 

Other than that, the other thing I‚Äôll say is filling your time with something else which is obviously very common advice. If you have nice places to walk around you, I‚Äôd recommend sticking your earphones in, getting some bangers on and getting out in the fresh air as that worked well for me. 

The other thing I wanted to mention without writing too massive of an essay is more around the actual effects of quitting. I don‚Äôt know how similar the effects are across different people, but for me, the most obvious symptoms were:

Boredom - this is why you need to find something to do. Smoking weed can be fun if you‚Äôre with friends or doing something for a special occasion, sure. But if you‚Äôre here and looking to stop, you‚Äôre probably doing it more than that. And in that case, it‚Äôs not that you‚Äôre doing anything fun whilst high - it‚Äôs just that weed makes you comfortable with being bored (yes, reference to South Park). You‚Äôre not going to instantly be satiated doing something more plain like going for a walk, but eventually will - give it time - which brings me on to my next point... 

General lacklustre/disinterest/apathy - I remember reading something on this topic from a neurologist when I was trying to quit. It basically detailed the way in which THC acts on the receptors in the brain to make everything more exciting/interesting/arousing/funny etc. and that over time, with abuse of the substance, the brain can down-regulate those receptors to adjust - essentially meaning that when you‚Äôre not high, the standard dose of neurotransmitters responsible for those feelings has less of an impact.

Now I‚Äôm not a neurologist, and I encourage you to look into this for yourself, but I felt this hard. This was probably the hardest part for me. It feels kind of like everything is just grey, flat, no peaks or troughs. 

However, if you are going through this, please know that it will come to an end. I actually thought it would take longer and it really caught me by surprise. I remember walking around the lake I lived by one afternoon, and a little group of cockatoos that were stood on the grass eating together really caught my eye - in a kind of fascinating way. I just stopped and watched them for a few minutes, really genuinely enjoying the moment - not because I was high and my senses were artificially heightened, but because I was actually present and it was really cool to see. I hadn‚Äôt felt anything like that without being high for so long, it really surprised me. It was like I had forgotten what it was like to feel that sort of intrigue and just enjoy a moment without simultaneously being completely baked. 

Those moments happen a lot more frequently now, more and more as time goes on. I can honestly say I really don‚Äôt miss weed at all. I did, but my brain adjusted, and I‚Äôm glad I stopped. Zero desire to return to it any more. And if I did slip up for whatever reason, as above, I‚Äôd just do what I did before - back on the horse. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs my 2 cents. I know most of you will get bored after a few paragraphs which is fair but I hope this helps some of you out there. You absolutely can do it and life without weed will be just as good if not better, just give it time.

If you‚Äôre really struggling, feel free to message me and I‚Äôd love to help if I can!

Im 27 years old now, turning 28 in a month. A string of traumas starting in childhood into my 20‚Äôs really drove me to smoke as a means to feel ‚Äúokay‚Äù in the world. The longest stretch I got sober was 6 months last year. It felt amazing to quit for those 6 months, I felt myself start to come back. Then, COVID got the best of me and what started as a one-time smoke turned into me smoking for 8 months... 

This plant & my decision to engage with it has:
- Ruined my ability to socialize & ruined social opportunities. 
- Put me into debt.
- Made an eating disorder exponentially worse.
- Made me more anxious & depressed than ever.
- Stripped me of a sense of identity. 
- Robbed me of opportunity. 

The sinking realization that I either quit now, or sink deeper & lose myself is a hard one. But, there is a part of myself that knows at its core I must fight for myself is what keeps me going. I know I can do this, and I know you can too. I‚Äôm ready for whatever comes up, no matter what. I‚Äôll take the pain, side effects, emotions, etc. because I know once I get to the other side it‚Äôll be worth every painful step.

They stabilized me the first day to send me home only for me to return later that night. Dry heaving to the point of near death is never fun.

I lasted 6 days and had a ""celebration"" smoke and then followed up with another 5/6 days off and then again another smoke. I done this throughout the course of a month. Strangely after the first 3-4 days I felt like I didnt need a smoke but for some reason did it anyway. I didn't even enjoy the smoke either. I felt like I had got over the hump and that the worst had passed and I was no longer a smoker. I was getting up early and going for long walks with the dogs, making nicer food, stretching/meditation and cleaning the house all very early in the day. I was more energetic organised and in control of my life. I was also learning to play guitar at night and getting on top of house work. 

I can remember smoking a joint after a week off and thinking to myself while rolling it ""why are you doing this you dont even want it.."" I justified it by telling myself im checking I'm definitely over it... Stupid but it is what it is. I remember being around friends even after this and passing up on a smoke which was a big deal for me so again I still felt like I was over the stage where I needed it but I was wrong.

Slowly but surely weed has creeped its way back into my life. I'm back smoking every day. My entire morning routine is gone. I struggle to get out of bed in the mornings. I feel groggy and unmotivated all the time. I feel less in control of doing what i want in the day. Im not as tidy as I was and in general I'm more lazy with less energy. 

Today I restart. I have found my hunger to quit. I've let 6 months slide and I know its got the better of me and to be honest when I realized this last year my whole mentality had changed back and I thought I'll fuck about up until christmas then start fresh in the new year but it's spilled into January and I know I need to get on the ball.

I want to stop smoking for personal and medical reasons. 

I truly believe I suffer from CHS, and will head to a doctor this week to confirm it. But what I really want to know is how did some of you stop smoking when it was a coping mechanism? I started smoking because I loved getting giggles and getting munchies and watching movies. Innocent 19 year old fun during college. Fast forward to today and smoking weed feels more like smoking cigarettes.

Life has become a lot more depressing. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with a couple mental disorders. And weed went from cute and fun to a daily need just so I don‚Äôt become irritable and even shittier. 

But now, I can‚Äôt even smoke. I smoke and I feel nauseous. And it‚Äôs fucked because I just remember all the nights alone, the walks I took where I just thought deeply about my life. I think I‚Äôve reached a point where I have realized the vkew that weed has given of myself isn‚Äôt beneficial anymore. I used to smoke a lot because it would allow me to become honest with myself as a person and my life as a whole.

I‚Äôm grateful because that insightfulness allowed me to seek therapy and help for myself mentally. But it‚Äôs also made me apathetic. Lazy. Now I realize whether or not I have CHS (90% sure I do), I gotta stop smoking as a whole for my personal betterment.

So please give me tips fellow leavers/leaves(sorry?)

I know myself. And the patterns I fall into, especially during depressive cycles. So can you all please give some advice on how you stopped. What made you stop. The challenges you faced after you stopped. And how you have changed for the better since. 

Please feel free to be as detailed as possible. And if some of you can talk one on one through pms I‚Äôd really appreciate it as I start to stop smoking for good. A big reason I smoked is because it numbed the pain of loneliness I have constantly; and I know when I stop smoking, the overwhelming sensation of feeling alone will wash over me. 

So I‚Äôm not asking for someone to be responsible over me, I know that‚Äôs my battle and one that will hopefully benefit me. I‚Äôm just asking more for some friends to be honest. Especially since you all are going through or will be going through the same.

If you're just starting the advice I can give is delete your numbers, go through your phone and delete old message threads, go through your dialed numbers and remove them from the lists, throw out your paraphenalia, create as many barriers for re entry as you can.

I definitely found some of that ease reading the posts from this community.

Weed is amazing.

I started using a couple years ago, maybe 4-5 years, I don‚Äôt really remember, as with so many things. My first experience with weed was actually with edibles. I know, pretty weird. My girlfriend at the time smoked occasionally and was trying to convince me to try it as well. I was adamantly against smoking anything. But I was curious, so edibles it was. In the beginning I only used every once in a while. The frequency increased over the months, but it wasn‚Äôt a regular thing.

After awhile me and my ex broke up. Partly because I was struggling with alcoholism. I‚Äôm have somewhat of an addictive personality. About a month or so after we broke up, she came over to pick up some stuff she had left at my place. We talked for a bit and she mentioned she actually had a pre-rolled joint with her and asked if maybe I wanted to smoke. For the first time in my life, I said yes. 

It‚Äôs still a pretty funny story to tell, I mean who the hell smokes for the first time with their ex who just came over to pick up some stuff. Anyway, we went to a park and smoked up. I got a bit paranoid. There were pigeons behind us making noises so naturally I thought the cops were about to bust us. 

Weed is amazing

Around that time is when I also dropped out of college, for the second time. I was happy though, I actually dropped out because I realized I wasn‚Äôt doing anything I loved. I ‚Äòfinished‚Äô therapy for depression and anxiety issues. I started doing what I loved doing, cooking professionally. Everything was looking up. 

Meanwhile I had had a taste of smoking. Slowly but surely, I started smoking more. First with friends. Then sometimes when I had some left over after a session with friends, I smoked the rest alone. That turned into buying weed just for smoking by myself. Then the frequency in which I smoked alone increased. In no time I was a daily smoker.

The surprise (to me), it didn‚Äôt really have any negative impact on me at all. I was doing well at work and actually got a promotion fairly quickly. I had fun, went out with friends, dated around and generally was enjoying life. I didn‚Äôt turn into a slouch. I actually was more productive and ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô, and more importantly *happy*, then I had been in a long time. In hindsight I was setting myself up for an unhealthy connection between weed and my life going well. More on that later.

Weed is amazing

I did this for about a year or two. Slowly but surely my depressive tendencies came back. Slowly I became unhappy. It all happened slowly, but definitely surely. I switched jobs a couple times. I actually ended working as a cook at a coffeeshop. Which is a place that sells weed over here (The Netherlands). So, my relationship with weed got even more intense. I went from a daily smoker that smoked 1 maybe 2 joints a day. To smoking a gram and more a day. At one point my tolerance got so high I didn‚Äôt even get high anymore when smoking less then 1.5 grams.  I did a couple of tolerance breaks, one month, two months. Sometimes it worked, sometimes I didn‚Äôt even make it a week before smoking again. 

During this time smoking definitely helped me in ‚Äòdealing‚Äô with the shit I was going through. It is kind of hard to be depressed and sad if you‚Äôre so zoned out you don‚Äôt really think about anything anymore. This of course didn‚Äôt actually solve my problems. It just made them disappear. But as I said before, I developed an unhealthy connection between weed and my life going well. So, I kept on smoking. As long as I kept on smoking, I could deal with everything.

Weed is amazing

After jumping from job to job for a while I decided to go back to college and try to make something of my life. I found a direction I really enjoy, safety & security management. In no time I was getting amazing grades. I had never found such success in something I also truly enjoyed. To this day I‚Äôm still in college and I‚Äôm still enjoying it as much as the first day. 

During this whole period, I kept on smoking. Once again, I did a couple of T-breaks, with mixed success. Overall, I smoked less then I did before. I had more days where I simply didn‚Äôt smoke even though I wasn‚Äôt doing a T-break, which was unheard of a year before. I kept this up for about two years. Then the pandemic hit.

Weed is amazing

During the pandemic I pretty much spent all my time at home. I have been working/studying from home for a little under a year. I did an internship, fully from home. During this time my depression came roaring back. As with so many people my mental health tanked. The complete lack of outside stimulants and especially the way the world has reacted to this global crisis pretty much depleted me of most of my happiness and energy. So naturally, I started smoking more.

In pretty quick fashion I was back to my old ways. Smoking a gram or more a day, every day. I tried to manage my usage. I tried telling myself I was allowed to smoke but only 2 joints a day. I tried to limit to my usage to the weekends and social settings. It was pretty futile. All of these attempts failed pretty quickly. Slowly weed started taking over more and more of my life. I started avoiding and canceling certain social activities so I could chill at home, smoke weed and play videogames. 

I used it as a crutch to not have to deal with everything going on around me. I used it to shut out the world. This way I could focus on just me. I still was, and am, performing well at school. Without sounding to much like a blowhard I am one of the ‚Äòbetter‚Äô students. I also met someone, and we have been in a relationship for over a year now. So, all in all, although the world was burning, I am doing good. And I was doing it while smoking. So why quit?

Weed is amazing 

but controlling. 

Yes, I was still performing well in all my professional endeavors, yes, I managed to meet someone and grow my social circles. No, it doesn‚Äôt turn me into a slouch, no it doesn‚Äôt have any big negative effects on my cognitive abilities. 

But I *had* to use it, I *needed* it to deal with the world and I *didn‚Äôt want* to quit. I fully believe that anything that has that much control over a life, isn‚Äôt healthy. I mean, it was also costing me a shit ton of money and the long-term health effects aren‚Äôt exactly great. But that isn‚Äôt the main reason I decided to quit. I want control back in my life. I want to stop thinking about weed pretty much every waking moment. I want to fully be in control of my mental health. Weed is commanding so much of my mental and physical attention. I just want my time back. I need the control back.

Trough all these years of use it never was weed that caused the problems I had to deal with. But it made everything worse. It made dealing with my problems something I could simply not do, or at least, pretend to do. 

So today, I start my journey to take back control. Honestly, I hope that one day I‚Äôll be able to have weed back in my life. Because it truly can be a healthy, fun and amazing part of a life. But I‚Äôm not ready to let it in yet. I cut up and threw out all my rolling papers (it was a lot), I threw out my bong, I threw out my vaporizers and I washed out my grinder and threw it away. I installed Grounded to keep me on track. 

I don‚Äôt know if I will be able to do it. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll able to ever let weed back in my life. These are all questions I‚Äôm not even going to bother to try to answer. All I know is I‚Äôm ready to take back my life and to stop being controlled by a fucking plant.

Like most here and [u/insufficientfunds907](https://www.reddit.com/user/insufficientfunds907/), I struggled with my addiction to weed for many years allowing it to hinder me from achieving all the things I'm capable of and keeping me in a permanent haze lying to me saying that everything was ""chill"" and there was no need to do anything productive.

It's been over 5 and a half months since I last smoked and I can say without a doubt that it's been one of the biggest steps into my personal development. I've achieved so much more than I would have had I kept smoking and my psyche is a lot cleaner as well and there's more money in my bank account. 

I hope this post motivates every single on of you here that is still pondering about committing to this change in your life's habits. It certainly is the best decision and after the initial stage of quitting, you'll wonder why the fuck you ever smoked in the first place.

Much love to you all",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7469246}"

I'm really trying to quit right now but it's just not working. I'm curious about what you folks think a particular experience I often have. 

I'll have an assignment or something due later in the day and I'll budget my time around it : "" I'll rip now and I'll be high for 4 hrs but I'll be ok when I have to work""

Then I do one bowl rip and because it's weed the self doubt comes and I hate myself. To deal with that I rip again and by the time i need to grind, I'm high as a kite. So I just do it high and inevitably get a shitty grade.

But that shitty grade only matters to me when I'm sober and that kicks off the cycle again.

I have been a smoker for about 4 years now, and have progressively increased my Marijuana intake within this last year and a half, year. I quit recently, and have noticed some very strange side effects. I have perused through the internet looking for other people with these problems, but alas, could not find much. Essentially, my stomach is acting up, but there is no pain involved. As more days go on, the more intense and constant the effects become. These effects include:

near-constant flatulence,

extremely, and I mean extremely, loud stomach noises (especially after eating),

an increase in defecating,

feeling like I HAVE to vomit after eating (but no nausea), even after eating some of my favorite foods!

and just generally weird stomach feelings. Again, no pain involved, but this is definitely out of the ordinary for me, and am just wondering if anyone else is experiencing symptoms similar to these or did experience some of these symptoms after quitting.

Sure, I've had a day or two where i didn't partake but i  honestly cant remember when that last was. Im 35, and grew up in a strict religious family. Becoming a pot head by 16 or 17 was sort of my way of rebelling against how i was raised. In a way, becoming a stoner helped me create the necessary  move away from a life i knew would never be fitting for me. Maybe thru pure luck but i was able to meet like minded friends, got an education on my own, and learned to follow a talent and passion of mine. Weed has been along for the ride always. 

I mean I've never really done anything particularly foolish because of weed or because i was high. I did well in college, I've had long term relationships, friends, a social life, life has been okay. By my early/mid 20's smoking night and day just became second nature. I don't think i really ever thought about it. Wake up, get high. Eating? Get high. Going out, staying in, get high. Intense day at work or school, get high. Nothin to do, especially get high. Every activity has seemed like a reason, to get high. 

At 26 or so i sort of suddenly developed an anxiety disorder. Its been bad at times. I have even been off and on medication to treat it. In a way i had always believed that weed helped. And perhaps it had at some point or on certain occasions. Im not really even sure any more. 

Over the years I have learned some skills that truly help in keeping my depression and anxiety in check. Exercise, diet, being around the right people, having the right job, etc. 

All the while smoking EVERYDAY. 

This past couple of months I have been really trying to pay attention to my body. Trying to observe the waves of my anxiety. Listening to my body, making note of my actions and routines. 

I have been in denial for years that i get anxious when i smoke in the morning( and other times). How many times do i need to sit in my quiet living room high with my heart beating out of my chest being anxious about the mundane activities i have planed for the day? Feeling good when i wake up and then, here comes the fog of weed and suddenly the same groundhog day experience( anxiety and mind set at least). Over and over and over. For a couple of weeks I've stopped smoking until at least mid day. Its helped a bit. 

Whatever i have been doing for years now just doesn't seem to work for me anymore. Something has to change. Being high for literally every thing just doesn't work for me anymore. 

I've enjoyed reading and relating to the stories here this past hour or so. Stumbled upon this sub from an unrelated comment thread w a link, must be a sign lol. And i find all of you on the first day in YEARS i decided i just wouldn't get high at all today. I felt so fucking good today. Almost no anxiety. Its been strange experiencing a clear headed day. Its weird being on Reddit on not being stoned. I forgot what it feels like to not be even a little stoned. Im still very much trying to process this day. 

Well that's my little story. I had a great day am looking forward to some changes. 

Cheers everyone.",196,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46910748}"
