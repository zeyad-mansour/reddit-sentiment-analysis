Tonight, I'm finally going to stop getting high so I can work on progressing in life. Hopefully this isn't going to be like the other 5,000 times I've ""stopped"". I wanted to make a post for accountabilities sake.

I'm an early-twenties something dude that has been getting ridiculously stoned since middle school. When I get high, I can't properly do anything of the things I want to. I want to go to college and get a new job, but every day I just wake up and get baked, way too baked to do anything so I just say fuck it and sit around jamming to music or sleeping all day.

I love cannabis and appreciate all its uses, but for me it just turns me into a loser and crushes all my drive/confidence. At the same time, my body, mind and soul crave the reefer at all times. How can I resist the temptations? What has worked for you guys? I'm open to EVERYTHING that could possibly help, because I feel like it's going  to take all that and more.",3

Kind of makes me wonder how I ever got by at my job smoking as much as I did (I’ve been a daily toker for years, with a handful of short breaks on the order of days sometimes weeks- but definitely many more days smoking than not.)

My emotional rollercoaster seems much worse this time around too, around days 2-5 I was in tears several times over things I normally would not be crying about - although thankfully that part seems to have passed now.

One of the best things I've done for myself, I have noticed that the irritability has went down and I am just overall better.

I am a better version of myself, I eat better because I dont have the munchies all day.

I work harder because my energy levels are great now.

I am able to experience emotions, when I was always high I had zero connections to my emotions.

I am a better dog owner, I take time the time to let my dogs go exercise more instead of just have them lay around more.

I don't feel nervous talking to people anymore, I actually strike the convo now!

I am becoming the me I am meant to be..

One thing that REALLY stuck out to me was the dreams, never realized that I was just passing out and never dreaming. Now I sleep way better and im well rested for the following day.

I have been in the gym doing WORK. Down to my high shool weight now, but have more muscle.

I know its only a week, but to me, thats a HUGE accomplishment and I feel damn good from just cutting out this bad habit.

To anyone considering not smoking anymore, you have to COMMIT!

No, ""Maybe tomorrow"" ""After this 8th is done""

NOW is the time, you dont know if tomorrow will be your last day.

The death of Kobe Bryant really put things into perspective for me.

What if I died without ever kicking this habit? What if  I leave this earth without ever really LIVING life..

I realize that I was not smoking for fun. I was smoking to get through the day and it turned into getting through my life. Not gonna lie: it was very hard to take the first step and decide not to smoke cold turkey. The first day was the hardest because I could not stop thinking about it. I went 4 days before I decided to hit my pen and surprisingly I didn’t miss it. Maybe because my tolerance was still too high but still it reminded me that the feeling was temporary and the issues underlying my mental health needed to be solved. I’m not saying that weed is bad, but for me, personally, it was starting to take over my finances, my social life and mental abilities. 

I won’t get back into how it made me feel. But what I will say is that I am on the second part of my break and I’m very proud of myself. This community is very supportive and it’s nice to see others going through the same thing. So here we are, again, it’s technically day 2 and I feel pretty good. The night sweats suck but I’m the positive side I am looking to dreaming again. 

I’m still coming up with a goal but it’s a start in the right direction.  Good luck to everyone in their journey and my inbox is open for support!

Ive being able to increase the time between intakes and take whole a lot less than I’m used to and reducing the hits everyday so I won’t have severe withdraw symptoms.

I created a ""care plan"" for quitting with the help of my therapist, and wanted to share the basics of it in case anyone else finds it helpful. I truly believe revisiting this plan every day is what is going to help my sobriety stick this time. Here's how it's laid out:

INSPIRATION
Quotes or links to posts/pages that inspire you.
For example: ""This drug does not serve me and never will."" Or ""Scientifically, cravings only last 15 mins."" I got most of my inspiration from this community :)

MY WHY: I WANT TO QUIT BECAUSE...
Here I put the BIG reasons why I'm quitting. There are many perks of quitting (which I included below) but when I dug deep, I had a few really big motivators to quit. 
For example: I'm worried about the health of my lungs. I want to get pregnant soon. I want to better manage my depression/anxiety. 

OTHER PERKS OF QUITTING
Here I put other benefits of quitting that weren't really the big reasons why I am quitting. If you Google this, there are lots of websites with good inspiration!
Examples: it will save me money, I don't have to worry about the smell in my house/on me, less puffy eyes in the morning

CHANGES IN ROUTINE/HABIT/LIFESTYLE TO OPTIMIZE SUCCESS
I knew once I quit my daily life would change.
Examples: establish regular exercise routine (I have a lot of detail in my care plan on how I might do this). Drink plenty of water. Take my Lexapro daily and continue therapy. Practice good sleep routines. Plan ahead to keep busy

THINGS I CAN DO INSTEAD OF SMOKING
I broke this down by categories: Relaxation (yoga, reading, pet cuddles); Beauty (paint my nails, pluck my eyebrows); Around the house (clean/organize a space, complete a small project or task); Get out (walk, go to a coffee shop, run an errand); and be crafty (paint, cook, decorate a space)

I hope someone out there finds this helpful! Feeling really encouraged right now. Let's keep fighting the good fight!",7

Need help with constant relapse.","Been a daily smoker for 4ish years. I got back into a relationship with my ex last month which kicked the strongest desire to quit in years. And while I've been mildly successful (haven't smoked 28 of the last 40 days) I keep going back to it and .... I'm just very frustrated with myself. 

I've made what seem like endless lists of all the different ways smoking negatively impacts my life, carry that list around with me in case I get urges/cravings. I've strategized with my therapist on what my triggers are (wide open evenings after work) to come up with different stuff I can do to keep occupied. But after some X number of days I end up going to pick some up and I'm back at square one. 

I've been trying to not be hard on myself. These sets of days makes up my most concerted quit attempt in years, usually I make it just one streak then go back to daily use for months. And 28/40 days of not smoking is better than daily. But I feel like I'm not making any progress. I think I leaned on the concept of harm reduction as an excuse to keep breaking streaks. 

The problem is I can't control how much I smoke when I start. So while I'm smoking less overall when I do do it I think my tolerance is dropping a bit and I get completely blitzed, like fall asleep on the couch blitzed and I check out completely from the world, avoiding any calls or texts until a day or 3 later when I crawl out and survey the damage I've done to my life again. I've squandered so much opportunity and so much of my life on this drug. I'm just flabbergasted that I keep going back to it. The cognitive dissonance of it is nuts.

Anyway, I've been addicted to weed for 11 years now. I'm 29. It's crazy to me to think of how long I've been smoking. Recently I've really been cutting back, but I still haven't gone over 2 months not smoking. 

The thing that gets me, the trick, is that weed tells me ""it's not that bad"". But every time I smoke, its bad. I totally lose myself, even with the smallest amount.

I really want to quit, and came here to have a community of support.

I am heavily addicted to weed. I started smoking when I was in the 12th grade and up until my second semester of first year it was just casual, only at parties kind of thing. 

I bought my first bong in February of first year and started smoking by myself a lot more. I never looked back. My friends all smoked and are currently still smoking; how could I not? That summer I got high everyday and until January of my second year I smoked everyday. 

but what happened? well my grades fell and I moved out of residence. I was lonely. I didn’t like my housemates and all I had was a bong to keep around. My grades fell, I got caught for plagiarism and failed that course; I was depressed. 

I keep suppressing my feelings and can’t figure out who I am. I’ve blown thousand of dollars on weed and It’s done nothing but ruin me. I’m smart and I could be so much more. So that’s why I’m writing this. I need it to be public. I’m only a day clean but having so many thoughts. How do I stop the cravings?

Thanks for reading my story.",5

Half my life has been spent in a haze, smoking 3-5 times a day, never missing a beat. Wake and bake? Without question, even though I knew I woke up high and groggy.

Childhood best-friends got replaced with stoners; reflections of my devolving self.

Goals I’d set for myself literally turned to ash.

I’ve always held a well-paying job, but that may have just been luck and working in a field I truly am passionate about. The “unlucky” part is I have nothing to show for all my hard work except debt.

Been meaning to clean my garage... for the last 3 years. I stopped planning projects... because I couldn’t “access” my tools.

I used to try and hide the smell. Once I got my medical license (5 herniated discs in my back), I didn’t care in the least for the smell. “Deal with it, cuz I’m dealing with my own problems”.

Now, I can’t believe where the time has gone. My kids have bluntly put that into perspective. I have never allowed them see or smell it. All they know is it’s my medicine, but I would be ashamed if they followed in the same path as me. 

Stopping them would be hypocritical.

Educating them about this poison, maybe using my broken self as an example, would be better. Don’t be like daddy.

 Now, where it should have helped with my inflammation, it causes me to flare up immediately and tenfold. 

I hate Big Pharma and try my best to stay away from pills, they are not suited for me or I am not suited for them. Needed intervention when doctor-prescribed Valium caused me to become suicidal. I noticed myself standing inches away from the trains as they’d approach.

- - -

Enough is enough; this isn’t going to help me anymore.

- - -

It’s been 7 miserable days and 6 sweaty nights... but I’ll deal with the aches and pains and inflammation for some clarity of mind and to feel human again.

My wife of 10 years recently said to me she doesn’t know the real (sober) me, which left me stunned. Now, she’s noticed my complexion getting better and my lips are not as purple.

It’s nice not having to go to sleep with and wake up to cotton mouth.

Dreams... since I’d started smoking, I’ve had lucid dreams 7 nights a week. I proudly accomplished everything I wanted to... in my dreamscape. That got old quick.

Now, I have random, vivid dreams that I don’t want to wake up from, but alas, I have to provide for my family. 

I am able to jump out of bed, unlike before.

Things are really getting interesting. Time is much more manageable; I get so much done in so little time.

I never knew I was witty. Never. Now, I make people laugh without even thinking or trying. My confidence has gone thru the roof and I have so much more energy. 

I think and plan ahead and enjoy following thru on these little goals. 

One of my sons just had his 8th birthday today, and I honest-to-God would not have known what to get him two weeks ago, lit as firefly could be.

I went gift-shopping for him this morning. Came across an R/C airplane. Suddenly, a crystal-clear memory of him asking me about it months ago flashed in my mind. 

I wish you could have seen the smile on his face when he unwrapped it.

Just that alone is an accomplishment to me and I am getting tears in my eyes wondering “what if I had gotten him something he’d forget about in a week?”. Now I know he’s going to have a fun and busy time outdoors, no iPad needed.

- - -

The temptation is strong. But I know better. I will be selfish and stupid to smoke again. It’s obviously not helping my body, how could it be helping my mind?

I’ve made a financial calendar which I plan to stick to. I’ll be debt- free in August if I can keep it up.

- - -

I am not asking for help, although I may need it. 

I just wanted to point out how beautiful life can be just as you were born into it. No need for an altered state-of-mind.

I cleaned my whole house this week, trying to stay busy. Surprised my wife. 

And believe it or not, my childhood best friend got in touch with ME just days ago. Kobe’s death really shook him, and made HIM put the effort into reconnecting with ALL of his friends, myself included. I went to his house the same evening and we let the children inside us laugh uninhibited at all our old jokes. Somethings never change.

Oh, and now he’s a physical therapist who will help me with my back issues.

Good things come your way when you stop indulging in the bad.

I may finally get to clean my garage this weekend. 

Wish me luck 🤞",44

I had quit once for about two years, then started again about a year ago when a neighboring state legalized and it was easy to get again. The first time I quit was because weed was dominating my life. I wasn't smoking because I wanted to, but because that was simply what I did. It wasn't even feeling good. When I started again I rationalized that I could moderate my consumption and it would benefit me to help with depression and social anxiety. It did seem to help at first. Not by making problems go away, but by helping me to not care about them. Seemed like a win at the time.

My intentions to moderate myself went out the window pretty quick. I started off only smoking a little ""snap"" after dinner a couple nights a week. It quickly became every night, escalating to a full bowl every night. Then I discovered concentrate and vape pens. I could keep the vape pen in my pocket, take small hits and feel good all day, and cap it off with dabs at night. What could to wrong?

Well, a lot more could have gone wrong, but it wasn't great. Got to a point where I was hitting the pen at work (very not good for my line of work), and at night I would be chasing after a high I couldn't reach. Thankfully the only negative concequences I saw were falling asleep early, wasting a bunch of money, and my lungs were hurting from sucking on that damn wax pen so much. Getting stoned wasn't really satisfying me anymore, and once again I was not doing it because I truly enjoyed it. The amount I was using was making my anxiety worse, and made navigating life much more difficult. I felt dull and unmotivated to achieve my goals in life. 

So now I am done with weed. I can't trust myself with it, and it doesn't help me. My brain seems confused as to why it is sober. My urges feel like my brain is saying ""hey, we're usually stoned when we do this, why are we sober?"" I told my wife I am quitting and got any leftover concentrate and paraphernalia out of the house. Reading this subreddit helped me realize that I am not alone, and what I am experiencing is common. I am already feeling the fog clearing in my head, and my thoughts feel sharper. I'm excited to see what my new normal mental state becomes without weed. 

But for now I am currently wide awake while my wife is fast asleep and there's not a damn thing I can do about it. Here's hoping normal sleep patterns return quickly. I should probably look into exercising.",6

Maybe a one off every once and a while, most about a mass shooting or something along those lines but I’d be aware at some point I was dreaming, and I’d shake the bad vibes as soon as I’d wake up.

Now it’s gotten sad. Every night is something new. One night was my boyfriend breaking up with me and his mom chasing me while saying hurtful things about my weight. Another night it was essentially Naruto and everyone died (people important to me and random people like various Naruto characters but Scooby Doo was there?) Most recently, I had a dream where my grandmother (who passed away 5 years ago) kept falling and tripping, and she couldn’t get up so I just sat on the ground and cradled her in my lap while she cried. That one really fucked me up and has weighed so heavy on my heart.

Unlike the shooting dream, I don’t feel like I’m dreaming, and I wake up full of dread to the point it’s hard for me to get up and out of bed.

I know dreams often are your subconscious coming out and working through things, and I have recently thought a lot about finding a new therapist and working some things out, but those things do not come up in my dreams (though I’m sure explaining them would be good use of session time.)

I was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy, they did drug test me and I had smoked the day before coming in for the test (all night sleep study followed by nap study the whole next day) but they still put on my report that no confounding drugs were in my system. My SO thinks since weed suppresses your REM, me not smoking could’ve pushed me into REM more quickly in my nap study, causing the narcolepsy diagnosis. I’m not convinced that 24 hours off weed could have such an effect (and my doctor clearly isn’t worried).

I have been smoking multiple times daily for the past 5 years and I'm finally sick of it. Starting January 1st I have not smoked a joint and I don't have any cravings because I found a good way to quit. I don't count my days sober because it just feels like piling a Jenga set higher and higher until it eventually collapses. You know the feeling of not smoking for 25 days and then you relapse. I have no interest in doing it anymore it made me waste some of the best years of my life when I should've focused on school and gone to university Instead of wasting my days working some scum job while I was baked before during and after all day every day

The tough part comes with my friends they are still about that life and I don't want to lose them so I will hang out with them and not smoke and see how that pans out, hopefully they don't view me differently and we can still enjoy activities together

I started smoking in the 1980s. I never wanted to quit. I love you, Mary Jane.

In all that time, I quit once for a whole year in the early 2000s, I was a gym bunny at that time. I forget what caused me to relapse, I think I had a knee or ankle injury when I was running and started smoking again the same day.

So I have just quit for a second time. I don't know how many days I am into my quit because I didn't note it on the calendar, I think it is just about coming up to a month? I didn't actually intend or want to quit. But when you've smoked like it's your actual job for 30+ years, you will ruin your teeth. I've really spent a lot on dental work in recent years but even my top-drawer dentist is getting to the point where he can't rebuild my face. Anyway, so I stopped buying weed about 4(?) weeks ago, thinking that I would just have a break and give my gums a rest. Then I went for one of my many dental appointments and found that my teeth and bones are in far worse condition than even I thought was possible and I have to stop smoking for ever or my whole face is going to fall off.

So that's how I managed to break a smoking career of 3 decades without even knowing what day I stopped because it was sort of unintentional.

When I quit before, for a year, I don't remember any unpleasant symptoms, maybe because I was exercising a lot. This time around, I would LOVE to be in the gym but I am working 14-16 hours/day, a routine that used to be comfortably cushioned by Mary Jane but now is not.

How I am feeling.

Good: my lungs feel great.

Less good: Tired. Interrupted, restless sleep at night. Sweating day and night. Feelings of dread (now passing). Spontaneous weeping. Fantasising about future scenarios where I can resume smoking, eg a doctor tells me I have 3 months to live. I know who would be the first person I would call, no question.

So a bit of backstory. My undergrad in science I was the ""perfect"" student- as in for my grades. I got 4-6 hours of sleep a night since I was always studying, never went out, and never had relaxed time since I was always studying. In the last 8 months of my undergrad, I started smoking... a lot. I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship (he smoked every day) and something about me snapped. I started studying all day, and smoking all night... my grades went up. I thought this was the shit at the time, but the lack of repercussion is why I can't stop.

Now I am in graduate school. I still smoke every day (its been like this a bit over a year now), which is troubling because I am in a research masters. Instead of going home and being the best student I should be for my supervisor, I get stoned. I spend all day waiting to be home so I can smoke- even though I wake up tired and hazy the next day. No one I know, except for one of my roommate, knows I smoke every day. But I genuinely don't know why I can't stop.  I know I would achieve so much more if I wasn't a total stoner- hell I prepped for this the for 4 years and now I am throwing it away day by day. I understand how I used to be was unhealthy (I would consistently get panic attacks and constantly stressed), but I'm not sure if this is better. I want to quit, and I tell myself all day I won't get high when I'm home, but when I do get home I start to feel fundamentally unhappy (and oddly, bored), and all I want to do is get high.

Additionally I have no drive outside of my graduate studies. I use to go to the gym every other day, hang out with friends, etc. I've ended every relationship (and potential relationship) I've had because I eventually open up about being a total pot head- that or I go out enough times high that they don't want to really associate with me. The only people who seem to be into that are other pot heads- which all have a common denominator of being complete losers I find (not to say I'm not a loser).

I don't know what to do, but if I don't stop it will catch up to me. It comes to say I'm a smaller person, and I don't think the smoking is best on my lungs (I use a bong). Any help would be appreciated.",4

I also had to keep my living space clean. Tidy house = tidy mind. I then (finally) passed a drug test to get a full time job, and got a gf.

Been smoking for 9 years everyday. Thought I'd smoke all my life, my parent are avid smokers too but I found out after discussions and some introspection that I was constantly making excuses to continue. I was doing okay but I wondered what was going on behind this hazy brain of mine. 

First week was terrible. I stopped kinda cold turkey only smoking some CBD to cope a little and then after a week I was done.

Had stomache ache and headaches, no appetite and would take an hour to fall asleep instead of 5 minutes.

Now that I am beyond those withdrawal effects, I am feeling better and more aware than ever. I changed many bad habits at the same time and it helped alot to keep my motivation going. Now I know if I relapse I'd have to live through this shit all again. 

I now remember dreams again, eat more regurarly than ever (thought weed helped me get appetite, I was wrong.) Food is still delicious and I have little craving of weed but I manage. (A roommate is still smoking)

I think my experience is positive and I am sure you all have it in you. It takes willpower but as long as you know why you do this. You'll be fine!

Keep on keeping on!

The reasons I smoked were psychologically because, first of all, I am a virgin young male and my relationships and sexual activity are non-existent. Like seeing people on campus around my age or even younger than me have all of these, and I am basically ostracized from every group.

If I was fulfilled in a romantic way, weed would never be my crutch. But I hate to cope it while sober and drown myself into this. One of my exes left me for another dude with the excuse that it was 'the distance that separated us.' Now she has a long relationship with that dude, and I am still alone.

Life is not fair, and weed actually helped me to cope with. The only option I have rn is suicide, but even that is hard to commit. We, as human beings, are not programmed to commit suicide while sober (unless you have big balls and low inhib).

Second, I have insomnia. I can't fall asleep at all without supps. I am constantly tired and angry.",4

In fact, smoking is pretty much what we always did together.

I managed to quit for over 60 days over the summer.  He saw how horrible the withdrawals were for me and I told him over and over again that I didn't want to go back.  I was also preparing to move and I knew I needed to be able to test clean to find a job.  Yet, on my birthday in August, he was able to convince me to smoke with him again and there went my quit.  I had just found out I was able to transfer to another call center in the city that I wanted to move to, so since I wasn't going to have to take a urine test as soon I thought why not?  Over the next month I probably spent $1500 on weed. I relapsed hard.

Now I'm having to go through it all over again, something I said over and over again during my last quit that I never wanted to have to do again.  My job has also turned incredibly toxic and is making me extremely miserable.  He's trying to convince me to go back to smoking and just try to fake the piss test but that isn't an option for me.  I would have too much anxiety trying to fake the test plus I won't interview well in the fog of being a regular cannabis smoker.

I first started smoking weed as a substitute for alcohol in college and I was immediately hooked. It took over my mind and made me feel things Id never felt before. Looking back I was probably depressed at the time and weed was a quick way out instead of dealing with my problems. 

Recently I’ve been smoking at night on weekdays and that always leaves me tired and slow in the morning on my way to work. On the weekend it’s even worse as when I don’t have anything going on I will smoke the entire day. The worst part of it is that weed doesn’t even make me feel good anymore. I just feel groggy and confused. As many others have said on this sub I go between wanting to be high when I’m sober and wanting to quit when I’m high. 

I’ve gone two days without smoking and I can already feel a difference, especially in the morning. I’ve noticed I swap out smoking for more exercise. Meditation and reading. I feel so much happier and healthier during the day it makes up for my current lack of hunger and insomnia. The crazy part is that I feel more well rested even with a little less sleep.

It helps me function, as when I’m sober my head is too loud and I have about a million thoughts running through my head that I can’t silence. Marijuana very literally makes me function like a normal human being. I do my best, fastest, and most focused work when I’m high as fuck. I’ve been using so long and have mastered the effects in such a way that people don’t know the differences in when I’m sober and when I’m absolutely gone. It’s even saved me from cancer. I’ve been using for what is about to be 11 years and I’m barely approaching my early adult years. Cannabis is a huge part of my life…that I’m just about ready to let go. But I don’t know what I’ll do about my loud and resonating thoughts. Today is the first time in years that I slowed down. I usually consume about a gram of concentrate every 3 days or so and it’s been a day since I’ve consumed and this is the worst I’ve felt whenever stopping. Usually I don’t even notice it and it goes away, but now I feel like I’ve come down with the flu. Marijuana makes me feel sober, act sober and think sober. But maybe that is just a fog. Not even my parents can tell when I’m just tired or really fucking high, I can’t even tell anymore. I think that’s a sign to back up for a second and reevaluate my situation and most certain addiction. Although it’s very difficult for me to gain a mental addiction, as I’ve quit IV and prescription morphine and hydromorphone 220mg daily and 6.0mg’s daily respectively because my doctor told me unless I was treated by him that the withdrawals from going cold turkey would kill me in 2 weeks.

Memories: It seems like so many forgotten memories have begun flooding back.  I'm looking over the last three years of my life, my ""stoner"" years as I call them.  2017 was great.  That's when weed was still a benefit.  Time slowed down and everything was funny.  It cured my depression, enhanced my creativity, and seemed to just make everything better.  Then, over the course of 2018 and 2019, it slowly but surely went from enhancing my life to becoming my life and then slowly but surely metaphorically took my life.  I look at my relationships with the people in my life in 2017 and I compare them to now.  I pretty much sabotaged every relationship that was important to me over the past two years and weed was at the center of it all.  Weed is like a jealous, manipulative significant other that slowly but surely turns you against your friends so it can have you all to itself.  Except for your smoking friends, who won't be there anymore when you aren't smoking.

Anxiety: I work in a call center and this withdrawal is making it incredibly difficult.  There are few times in my life that I've been under more constant stress than right now.  I can't start looking for another job yet because at Day 15, it's not possible that I will test clean.  Plus, with the brain fog there's no way I could interview well anyways.  I just have to get through it.  I also have a lot of anger about having to give this up.  Deep down, the reasons are internal but there are a lot of external reasons I'm giving it up as well and my mind is constantly trying to tell me that if weed was legal and didn't have the stigma it does that I could just smoke.

Cold and flu symptoms:  Constantly hacking up gunk.  I can't even exhale without going into a coughing fit. Nose is plugged and my throat feels like razors.  I really, really hate this.  I'm so ready to feel normal again.  I have a feeling this part is going to last a while.

I am on the same boat as many of you: in that I have good intentions to stop smoking as it gives me huge anxiety and makes me unmotivated and reclusive, but cannot pull through even one day because my brain starts convincing me otherwise.

It truly seems like I always forget my good intentions of the night before when the day reaches noon/afternoon and my mind seems to be very focused and adamant on getting my 'fix'.

Cannabis being somewhat of the first substance addiction that I face, I am really struggling to stay strong in these moments, where I cannot even trust myself. Cannot trust my brain and instincts as they all tell me to smoke.

What to do when you cannot listen to yourself? 

What can I do in these moments of cravings? 

As in these situations I truly believe smoking wouldn't be that bad of a thing, even though I still have a voice deep down that knows that smoking weed holds me back and hurts me in so many ways.

But the voice in my head telling me to smoke weed shouts so much louder than my rational self...

I also feel stuck on thoughts that make me upset and that I can’t change.. ex. I have a standup shower and I want to take a bath so bad... like taking a bath would fix all my problems. I don’t have a lot of support in my life.. I’m a single lady in my early 30’s-I don’t talk to my family, and a lot of my friends are married w kids and busy busy. I’m very close w my coworker but she doesn’t care to hear about or help me w my issues BC she’s a big smoker and feels like I’m judging her.

And now that I’m 30 days sober and starting school I’m a little nervous with the pressure of responsibility and studying and what not. Anybody got any words of advice or have been through something similar?,2
2020-01-28 20:48:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/evfrq2/day_2_i_had_a_meltdown/,Day 2 - I had a meltdown,"Today started okay, until I started menstruating. The pain and nausea is something that I would always turn to weed for. I stuck it out, and left home sober. Out in reality, shit kept going wrong. Someone kneed me in the metro, and I was so angry. I was kept waiting for a meeting, and ended up leaving because I was so upset. On my way home, a car was slowly edging past the stop sign I was crossing, and I turned around and looked at the driver and pointed at the stop sign fiercely. I was SO on edge. I realized it was happening and couldn't stop it.

When I got home finally, a guy I was seeing decided to have a talk about ""us"". I totally broke down, and couldn't finish the conversation without trying to throw away the entire relationship because I just couldn't deal.

And then I got a notification from Reddit about a sub community about consuming cannabis in moderation. It was like the world wanted me to smoke. The only thing that calmed me down was the idea that I could smoke. I decided I would because the subreddit validated that idea.

I haven't yet, as my meltdown is over and I feel better. I stopped crying finally and no longer feel anger or on edge. Now I am just tired. I already decided I would smoke, but I don't know. I feel so empty.",3

I've been smoking daily for 8 years, with the exception of one weed free time period when I was trying to find a job. 
I'm working with a therapist, and don't think I could be doing this without her. She helped me develop a solid plan to quit, and texted me tonight telling me she has faith in me. 
I was too embarrassed to admit to my two best friends (who I started smoking weed with) that I NEED to quit until today. I decided I needed to tell them on my day one, and they were so supportive that it made me cry.
I've been browsing this community for a few weeks, and seeing everyone's struggles and successes has been so helpful. I don't know anyone else that's struggled with this addiction (who has tried to quit) so finding a community of people who are going through the same thing means a lot.

          I woke up today stoked for my new life. My plans have plans in their plans. All health and wellness and spirituality. It feels good to prioritize my wellness; body, mind, and spirit. It also feels self-indulgent and silly, but I don't put much focus on that. Finding love from this community on my last post gave me so much motivation :) I am so grateful that internet and reddit exists and that people gather in this made-up space to lift each other up and better our lives. I can just imagine the gorgeous ripple effect this has in the world and I am giddy to be a part of it :)

On a sour but truthful note, I'm worried about what my journey is and will do to my relationship. My partner is wonderful and kind and reminds me a lot of cannabis actually. He is always around, he gives me that warm hug feeling whenever I want it and booty rubs, he prefers dumb jokes to anything serious, and prefers not to move or do much lol he and I were stoners when we met but he smokes quadruple what I did and I just steadily started smoking as much as he does. Its so much fun and its so easy. Its been 4 years of thick clouds though and I never wanted to have such a heavy habit. I know my addiction is my doing, I know I could have passed on the joints and bowls but I didn't. Now I am though. He doesnt want to quit with me and is even staunchly against it, wont discuss the downsides and doesn't respond when I talk about why I want to change. I love him though. He is my best friend, hell, my only friend and we have children. I wonder where this will take us. I know he cares for me and he is a good man, and I know one way or another, my sobriety is good for all of us. 

Everything changes when we do, eh?

Thank you for listening leavers. All my love. ❤",4
2020-01-28 19:39:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eveuna/struggling_with_creativity/,struggling with creativity,"I’ve been smoking all day everyday for the last 12 years.

I’d smoke joints mixed with tobacco. I’ve wanted to seriously stop for a while and I tried to quit two weeks ago - as I was running out I decided not to get any more weed or baccy. My partner who has recently quit smoking cigs (he’s not a stoner) used Allen Car’s Easy Way to stop smoking method and said I was better off to do the method to quit cigs instead of will power alone. He was right, a week ago having drinks with friends I couldn’t stop craving a cig and smoked one. The method requires you to not abstain from smoking while you read/listen to it so I bought some tobacco. I had a little bit of weed left enough for 1 spliff and I smoked that. 

I can honestly say after doing the method 6 days ago I have absolutely no desire for a cig or spliff at all. No desire to smoke. 

My problem is I’m struggling to be motivated to do anything. 

Before I would wake up and smoke and just smash the day, like all the stuff I needed to do in the house/ housework. I had so much energy and focus. I feel so at a loss. Like I’m kinda just flitting about tryna motivate myself to do anything and stay engaged.

I live super isolated so the pluses I’ve found from stopping smoking weed is that I am way more responsive to other people I guess from not being in my own head so much. I can just leave the house easily to go out and meet up with someone whereas before I just wouldn’t bother but also wouldn’t really be bothered about it. Now I actually read and reply to messages more or less straight away instead of putting it off for hours/days/ever. 

The problem I’m having is I am seriously struggling with creativity. I’m a self employed artist and work from home. I’m struggling to create anything or do any work at all. 

Normally I would smoke weed all night and just create for hours and hours and be totally in the zone or flow or whatever. I’m just completely drawing a blank now. I loved doing the art before and now I feel like I’m tryna draw blood from a stone. I even sat at my desk got all my paint stuff out and was just staring at it for like 20 mins. While smoking, before I’d even realise it hours had passed and I’d made something awesome. I feel like an alien and just feel totally disengaged from it. It’s making me sad but more so it’s fucking up my livelihood. It’s been like this for the last two weeks since quitting. Except the day that I smoked that last spliff, I spent all night doing work. 

I’m afraid that I’ll never be able to access that part of myself again. I just don’t want to be smoking all day every fucking day. A couple years ago I quit tobacco for a year but was still smoking weed in a pipe or pure rolls and found that I could kinda take it or leave it. I mean that I would get to the evening before having any craving or desire to smoke so would smoke a little bowl or have a few tokes and it was fine whereas when smoking baccy I just have an urge to smoke first thing and all the time. Maybe that’s the nicotine cravings. I would only ever really smoke cigs if I was out drinking and couldn’t have a J.

Still tho, I don’t wanna have to rely on weed to do anything, I want to be free. 

Has anyone else had any experience with this? The creativity part. Does it come back naturally over time? Will I ever enjoy / be able to work properly again??

It’s a good job I’m saving all this money from stopping smoking cos I sure as shit ain’t making any art to sell rn.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you :D",3

I’m at 115 days sober! I never thought I could have done this. Smoked almost daily from 16-18, finally quit this September. Don’t want this to turn into another rant of mine, so I’ll just give some tips and share how I’m feeling :)

First of all, things really do get better. It’s hard to measure, because it doesn’t happen on a day to day basis. But when I think back to my mental state a month or two months ago, I’m definitely doing better. Still not 100%, but getting closer every week. 

Still have bad episodes of anxiety, which for me presents itself as severe dissociation/DPDR. Depression is getting better, but it’s still there for sure. I have more motivation, and I’m starting to develop goals again. I’m working out and eating healthier. Still need to work on my sleep habits though. 

I just finished winter break from university, which was great for getting myself back on solid ground. I had multiple opportunities to smoke with old friends, but I turned down every one. Classes started for me today, but I haven’t enrolled fully yet and I think I’m going to go part time this semester. Spend more time at home and keep getting healthier mentally. I finally started my own business that I’ve been wanting to forever, and it feels great

Tips:
1. Leaves is great. I love the community here. But don’t spend hours on it per day, especially in the early stages of quitting. Can turn into a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts when you’re reading about other people’s struggles. 
2. Get close with people again. Spending even more time with my girlfriend, friends and family has helped take things off my mind a lot. 
3. Eating healthy, drinking water, getting good sleep and exercise go a LONG way. Make it easier for your body to heal
4. Take it day by day. Don’t tell yourself you’re done smoking forever, tell yourself you aren’t smoking today or this week. Then do the same tomorrow and next week. When you’re having a bad day, whether it’s anxiety or depression or cravings, remember that’s all it is; a bad day. Tomorrow’s a new day

Let me know if there’s anything else I can elaborate on :)",8

Problem is, I don’t think it would end with the weekend. I think it would just be a relapse that I would take home with me. Or it would just become a pattern; keep running away every weekend to get high.

But truth is, I smoke every night, bingewatch series, eat too much and, well, can hardly go a day without.  I'm sure this has affected my life seriously.  Or has it? Am I kidding myself and putting too much blame on the smoking instead of adressing other issues? I regularly quit for a week or so and then the first two evenings I can smoke a little bit, but it always goes back to smoking 2-3 joints, eating, watching, hating myself for smoking, wanting to be sober, saying to myself that I won't smoke the next day, but lo and behold, the craving comes up when the workday ends and I'm back into that same old cycle.

What will it be upon running out, a newfound freedom from the plant, or shaking in your boots while pulling your finger away from the plugs contact on your phone. The illusion of control comes into play here. Our minds crave this plant so, and will attempt, without our volition to justify caving in. Indeed the mind can be a prison of sorts. 

However, forcing yourself to think about the issue can relieve these mental back and forths. Given that the mind functions through nothing more than electrical signals, reality is simply your interpretation of those signals.  What seems to be the reality of needing weed is no more than a mental blindfold we have lowered over our eyes to cope with whatever myriad of issues we have. Thus, there are only two realities in this closed universe, one where you need weed and one where you do not. Choose wisely, Morpheus out.

This time for real,"I started smoking weed when I was 15 or 16, when living in my head started to get really hard to handle. To begin with, I would only get high like every few months, when there was a party or my ability to cope was wearing thin. Gradually that increased to weekly then, when I developed chronic pain that doesn't respond to normal painkillers, daily. Now I'm approaching 29 and I've smoked more or less continuously for the last 7 years. I don't even get high any more, I'm smoking like a gram a day just to feel somewhat normal.

I haven't smoked today. The not smoking was kind of easy actually, but going through normal daily life without smoking has been hard. I feel kind of delicate, insecure. I keep wanting to cry for little or no reason. I nearly had a full out panic attack over a spider in my bathroom (medium sized by British standards, probably laughable to an American or Australian). I'm fiending for just any kind of drug right now, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine... Anything that'll take the edge off.

I feel like one of those caricatured drug users in a PSA.

2020-01-28 11:12:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ev7h46/day_5/,Day 5,"The decision came to me a few days ago at midnight, stoned.

I realized, what the >!fuck!< am I doing?

I came to the realization that the plant has control over me, not vice-versa. I told myself for months, for years, that I had it under control. My boss seemed satisfied, my grades were fine, my friends were still there, my girlfriend hadn't dumped me, what's the problem? No one said anything like ""you have a problem, OP"".

But, I did.

Luckily, the decision was made and it feels great. Although I have lost significant weight (not good for me) I am no longer a slave to the sticky-icky and that is worth the pain. I go to class early and stay late. I do not speed-walk home so I can pack a bowl ASAP. I am spending more time with my girlfriend, and the times are of higher quality.

Previously, I was just getting by. My life was *fine* as a stoner. I did what I needed to do. I was able to hold jobs, attend schools, and hang out with friends all while keeping my dirty little secret.

What I did not realize is I was handicapping myself. I think one reason it is so difficult to recognize this handicap is because it is minor, we aren't talking about psychedelics or opioids. We are talking about weed, a drug that seemingly does not impair. The truth is, marijuana does impair by sinking it's claws into your skin and never letting go.

Typically, I have a strong sense of willpower. I am able to easily go on a diet, get out of bed, etc. But with marijuana, my willpower is on vacation... Oh? I have an 8th in the drawer...might as well smoke it! Oh? You're about to watch a movie? Gotta smoke, it'll enhance the experience! About to eat dinner? You know the deal.

While these claims of ""enhancing the experience"" are possibly true, where does it end? Are you going to enhance every god-damn experience you experience until your tolerance is equivalent to that of Snoop Dogg? It has no end for me, so it's gotta be all or nothing. For this reason I have a XL-PostIt on my monitor claiming ""IT'S NOT WORTH IT"", because for me it is not. The wonderful positives do not outweigh the harsh negatives.

Someone on this sub said it best for me (paraphrased) *""it's not about the highs, it's about the lows""*. As much as the stereotype exists about marijuana being a happy and relaxing drug, it is also true that she can cause great amounts of stress, anxiety and anger when abused. Indulge yourself frequently enough and the universe finds certain way of punishing you for your gluttony.

Stay strong, ex-ents!

It's not worth it.",3

I’ve battled with quitting and relapsing many times before but I was in a very good spot mentally this time, I thought I did all the right things and had ample time since I last got high but it was my arrogance that failed me. It got me thinking that it’s always some form or arrogance that fuels my failures with weed. 

“I’m young it doesn’t matter” “I’m in college it’s normal” “it’s safer than alcohol” “you can keep it in moderation this time” the list goes on and on. 

At the end of the day I fucked myself over, and disrespected people who care about my future; regardless if I live in legal rec states or my opinions about my productivity while using.

I was caught in the cycle of wanting to be sober while high and high while sober that many of us are familiar with. I knew my mental health was suffering, but I kept convincing myself that weed was helping me, or even that it was good for me. I can’t even count how many times I had tried to quit, promising myself that each time was “the last,” justifying my action of smoking 10-12 grams in one night as my last shabang, only to re-up the day after. 

Then 2020 came around, and I knew it was time to really give quitting a try, as it was wrecking my health and finances. I tried quitting around the beginning of the new year (Jan 6th?) only to relapse on my 6th day. I had a massive panic attack and ended up in the ER. What followed was bad depersonalization and derealization. I was terrified that I had developed schizophrenia or some sort of psychosis. I ended up going to a psychologist because I was afraid. I was even seeing visual snow and had massive health anxiety. I thought I was fucked. The symptoms have so far subsided and I’ve been feeling a lot better since quitting, even though I still feel a little dreamy, I’m feeling significantly more stable. 

**Pros of quitting so far, even though it’s early in my recovery**

* My memory has already improved, although it still needs time, I can remember shit like where I put my keys.

* My anxiety has already decreased, and I’m more comfortable in social settings 

* My sleep is significantly better, and I feel refreshed after 7 hours opposed to having to sleep much longer.

* My dreaming is back, and I look forward to them every night.

* I eat a lot less trash food, and I get full easier. 

* Im already saving more money, because I’m not spending $160-$200 on an oz every 4-5 days.

* Im trying harder at work, and have more mental faculty to do so.

* I am less flaky on my commitments, which is a big problem I have while smoking. I actually follow through on shit now

**Cons that I’ve noticed, but I plan on conquering these with time**

* I am way more irritable

* I’m bored more often, slight anhedonia

* I feel like I’m living in a dream sometimes, still suffering from dp/dr, although it is improving

* I have health anxiety and more headaches than ever before.

* Less patient, my focus is crappy too

* Although I get better sleep, my sleep schedule is all jacked up. 

* Brain fog is a bitch


There are probably more I’m forgetting in both categories, but all in all I feel much better and am firm in my decision to quit. This is the longest I have ever gone without weed since I started smoking 5 years ago. I’m here for anyone that needs support as I couldn’t have done it without this community. I added a person on Snapchat through this sub that has helped me tremendously. I know I’m still very early in my recovery and I’m sure I’ll improve with time.

I have strung together 3 days, 2 days, etc. But never longer bc I can easily justify that weed is the lesser of two evils and ""at least I'm not drinking.""

I may be somewhat a-typical around here. I'm 37. I've never smoked cannabis much before this year. But somehow, with it being legalized, and being surrounded by people who do smoke it, I decided it might be a ""good thing"". Perhaps a replacement for alcohol.  I thought I knew what I was doing, and that it would be something small I would enjoy. To chill out and relax right?

Boy was I wrong.

I only vaped for about 3 months. Mostly bad experiences at that. But in my last session, I decided I was going to end my use of it with a bang on my birthday.  I had a large amount (for me). Maybe almost a gram.  And then I stopped cold turkey.

About 4 days later I had a massive panic attack in the middle of the night. Followed by a huge fog over my head.  The first week off cannabis I could barely talk, it was like my brain couldn't formulate words very well. I could barely keep up with conversations. 

And then came the disassociation / depersonalization. I became terrified I was getting schizophrenia. At the worst of it, time looked slightly faster than normal. I thought I had destroyed my brain. Everything looked empty and hollow, like looking at the world as if it were a screen. 

Over the next 3 months I experienced what seemed to be a steady array of mostly non improving symptoms: Brain fog, anhedonia, headaches, dissasociation, nausea, dizzyness, panic, anxiety.

After those 3.5 months I started to get small breakthroughs. A little bit of sensation, here and there. At  about 4 months i came out of my disassociation. Now at 5 months, I'm somewhat still anhedonic, but definitely have consistent dull, but again consistent pleasurable sensations. It feels like I always have a mild headache. I've had some other weird stuff, like Parasthesia...and the worst part about recovery at least to me...brain zaps. I'll have an occasional tidal wave of what feels like electrical energy when falling asleep. Makes it hard to sleep. But most nights I'm getting 8 hours.

I'm simultaneously glad I'm inching towards feeling better. I hold no expectations though. It could be 1 month or 18 months. I'm deeply thankful I've recovered as much as I have. Of course any recovery stories from PAWS are welcome. I'd like to know I'll come out the otherside and return to normal.

I go to the gym 5 days a week, intermittent fast, drink water, run, and strength train. Doing everything I can. Eat super healthy as well. Lots of Omega-3s. No caffeine. 

I tell you though, I am so mad at both myself and society in general...because i had no idea quitting Cannabis could go like this. I'm so glad so far my job and relationships are surviving. I've been a pretty clean person throughout my life. I have a good career, a great girlfriend, and for me to put it all at risk like this...wow...my own arrogance and stupidity really came out to teach me a lesson. I got influenced by all the hype, my brother, my personal trainer, Joe Rogan, some other friends. Maybe after this I'll be more cautious and calm. I'm looking forward to recovery and enjoying lifelong sobriety from weed. Maybe I'll drink alcohol again in a few years. 

Glad people here are supportive. I'm up and down with depression and optimisim. Encouraging words are welcome.",31

About a year ago I quit for a couple of months and I was stupid enough to start again without having my life on order. 

Quitting is going pretty well, and I'm feeling great, but this time there's one thing really different from last time. I'm having a fuck ton of trouble sleeping. Last time my sleeplessness lasted for about 4-5 days and I would wake up after about 4-5 hours and I wouldn't be able to get back to sleep. This time though, I try to sleep and after about an hour I open my eyes and I am wide awake again. I'm not really sure if I'm actually sleeping, but it's awful. 

I think there's a couple of differences from last time. First of all, I used to drink every day, but nowadays I mostly only buy beer in the weekends. That was a though one, since I had been drinking daily for way longer than I was smoking weed. The other thing is that I have been unemployed for the last three months. I quit drinking during week days in this time period, partly because I just couldn't afford it. But hey, it helped me do something I've wanted to do for a long time. The problem is that I started smoking way more than I did before and it really got out of control. 

The positive thing is that I am actually completely sober for the first time in about 10-12 years now. I'm actually experiencing a me that has been buried all that time. I fucking love it. I've been struggling with what might have been a depression and I'm feeling happy for the first in a long time. Starting an awesome new job with awesome people is also helping a lot! 

So, I'm going pretty strong on this new high which is being sober, but I have trouble sleeping. I'm have never experienced this kind of insomnia before. The only good sleep I had was Friday when I drank a lot of beer because I had friends over and we went to a bar afterwards. I must say that felt very good but I don't want to go buy beer just so I can sleep, you know, because I used to have a problem with that too. :)

I don't really know if I am posting this seeking advice, but I've been complaining to my smoker buddy who quit yesterday and I realized I shouldn't put this extra burden on him. So thanks for letting me blow of some steam here. Gonna go and try to get some sleep now. Ciao!",4

I say ""on the fence"" but what i really mean is that something deep inside of me wants to quit, to know myself from a sober standpoint.

 I have been smoking marijuana regularly since the age of 14, and i think ive enjoyed plenty of time being high. Its a social and spiritual experience that I dont frown upon nor do i wish to judge against. 

The hardest part about quitting is just that, as a 21 year old, everyone is doing it. I have always been social and outgoing, and unfortunately smoking weed was a part of my personality and in turn attracted many other potheads into my social circle. I dont have many friends who dont smoke weed. With that said, my willpower to say no to an offered smoke sesh is very low. 

My main reason for wanting to quit is a desire to reconnect with myself. I fear that I dont know who I am beyond the weed. Or rather, i know exactly who I am beyond the weed, but ive lost touch with him. I fear that my brain is foggy and clouded from abuse of this plant. I want to reconnect with myself spiritually without the use of mind altering substances. The happiness and euphoria that comes from the mind producing its own chemicals are something different than the dopamine or serotonin that are produced by outside substances. 

Although in moderation drugs arent bad, i think ive had my fill and im ready to move on into a life of sobriety and mindfulness. If anyone would like to join me im here for you all.

I was a daily smoker for nearly two decades with perhaps a year combined of quitting time in my past. But already, after a little over two weeks, I've noticed my self-confidence change. I no longer have such negative self-talk in my head going on during all waking hours. Bud just exacerbated my negative thinking and caused me to further dip into depression.   


And I now no longer shield myself from social gatherings. The first week after quitting I still had a bit of social anxiety, but now, a little over two weeks into it and I find myself looking forward to social outings whereas used to I'd have to coach and mentally prepare myself before going if I went at all.  I'd so much rather preferred to have plopped myself down on my recliner and watch movies/TV series all night. Which of course made me feel like shit for not going out and seeing friends. Now, I love going out and I haven't watched a movie or sat down to binge-watch anything since I quit other than during meals.   


I wish I had done this sooner. I had quit twice before, but I had done it for reasons other than myself. I quit for a job or a partner, and not for myself.

I've posted before and managed to get to day 4, but never past the weekend. I tried. I really did. I wanted to be the kind of person that could still smoke on the weekends.

Oh my goodness was I ever wrong. But turns out that's a good thing.

I was DONE with cannabis, but my Addict Brain wanted it so I kept smoking it. I didn't like the smell, the taste, the paranoia and anxiety after smoking, the fuzzies the next day, or the inability to hold a single thought in my head.

Man, that last one bothered me more than I want to admit. I was getting the stupids. Couldn't do basic math. Couldn't figure out how to word a resume. Couldn't think a thought. And this was after only smoking once a day! Once a damn day! I wouldn't call that a heavy user, although definitely a regular user. But the cannabis was building up in my body and getting in the way of my own intelligence.

So I told myself I had to quit for good. No more casual smoking. No more weekend weed. No more. None. 

My Addict Brain yelled at me, sure did, and I kept saying, ""yes, I know. You'll miss it. But I'm in control now so buckle up and ride the waves with me."" Yeah, AB kept yelling, but the shouting is mere whimpers now.

I threw out all my stuff. All of it. Scale, grinder, flower, storage jars, lighter, everything. And I did it on garbage pickup day so I couldn't go and retrieve it. Yeah, I know me well enough to know I'd tear the bag open if AB took control.

Now my thinking is clearer (although still not at the pre-pot levels I remember so fondly), my sleep is WAY better, and I'm not so damn anxious all the time.  I know I have a ways to go, I know I'm not in the clear yet, but as of right now I'm sober longer than I have been in a decade. A DECADE. I feel like the world moved on without me, that I got left behind, but dammit, I'm moving forward now.

Oh, and something I do that helps me and may help at least one person reading this: every night that I go to bed sober, I write a little 's' on a notepad and put a circle around it (with the date). I like to watch the little circled s's accumulate and every time I wonder if it'd be okay to have a pill, joint, bowl, whatever, I look at my little collection of s's and decide I don't want to throw them away. Might be silly, but it works for me.

Good luck y'all, whether you're on day one or day 1001, you've got this!",35

I've smoked on 90-99% of days for the last 3-4 years - I know that's not too long for some people but I'm only 23. I just want to put a lot of my thoughts into writing and see what sticks, because there's nobody in my life I want to talk to about this (or feel like I can w/o judgment).

What's so weird is that when I was in high school, I was so *certain* that all people who smoked daily were potheads that had no goals or motivation... Mostly stuff my parents told me. So when I found myself smoking daily but not living the lifestyle of a typical ""stoner"" it kinda hit me that there are probably thousands (millions?) of others out there like me. It's a complete secret that I get high as often as I do. And I maintain it by treating it as a reward - I get all of my shit done, or an amount that I convince myself is enough, and then smoke the night away by myself. When I smoke with friends a couple times a month I act all ""oh this is so fun, my tolerance is so low"", even though I'm so used to enjoying the high by myself that the only anomaly is that I'm now sharing it. For a long time now I've convinced myself this routine can go on forever, and to be fair I'm in a competitive graduate program and managing, but I ignore that I'm spending hundreds a month on weed, wasting my evenings, slowly fogging my memory, and damaging my lungs, little by little. Making A's is all fine and well but not if I pretend that my routine isn't depleting my health and bank account and even enjoyment of things while sober. 

The thing I want to talk about most is changing what I do in my evening free-time. I'm only 3 days sober and I'm already thinking ahead to what I should do after dinner. Usually: Smoke a bowl with my mini bong, watch Youtube, JO, play video games, eat junk food, and generally just wasteful shit that's selfish and adds to nothing. Now, I don't even want to snack and watch funny videos without being high. It's like I've ruined these things for myself. 

I'm optimistic because I've been wanting to do this since like mid-2018. Makes me want to cry thinking that quitting was supposed to be my NYE resolution last year and now we're some 340 high nights and $900 deeper. But maybe it means something that I'm trying to quit at such a random time with no real impetus... Maybe the impulsiveness of quitting is good enough as long as it sticks. I'm out of weed, I'd have to travel to get it... I'm lucky that it would take effort to refill, otherwise I'd be smoking in about 3-4 hours again. 

So for discussion, I'm sick of feeling alone in that I'm a closeted daily smoker and my friends and family have no idea how much it's consumed the latter part of my days. Is anyone else in this boat, and how do you get over yourself and just tell people even if they'll be disappointed? Secondly... It just feels so daunting getting back to enjoying the things I did in my free time without weed. I literally haven't masturbated sober in over a year, and I exclusively watch TV while stoned, and I'm even having trouble sleeping without the buzz. I know it will get better and that boredom is a part of life, but I got so good at diluting boredom with marijuana that I don't know how to deal with it anymore. 

Lastly, that post that said ""when I'm sober I just look forward to getting high, and when I'm high I feel guilty and wish I was sober""? My god that is so insanely true for me.

It sucks but I really need this to get me to do better and have a better balance in my life and take control of my emotions, thoughts and actions.

I would be so impatient at work to get home and smoke again. As soon as I walked in the door, full bladder and all, I would go straight to my bong and smoke a bowl. I needed to smoke a bowl before anything. Before brushing my teeth, before leaving to work, before taking my dog out, before cooking dinner, before taking a god damn shit.... its disappointing and scary to take a step back and realize you're a true addict.

Always kind of disappointed with how much I used but never really had any intentions to change. Very rarely did I take days off unless I was very busy. This year I was diagnosed with adhd and began medication which immediately cut my usage back immensely. Went from multiple times a day to usually once a night or not even at all. In the end I kind of realized why am I doing this? It felt very pointless to continue smoking, especially since weed exacerbated my adhd symptoms along with my anxiety. 

The first week hasn’t been too bad, some cravings the first couple of days, insomnia(but I’ve always had this), and some sweats which made me very uncomfortable. When I first took this break my plan was to only smoke on the weekends but I’m quickly realizing I don’t need to at all. There’s literally no point, it doesn’t make me a better person, and it’s literally throwing money away for a high that bottles me up, and hides true emotions. However I have seen some pretty bad withdrawal symptoms, especially appearing later in the quitting cycle. How much worse should I expect things to get, and is there a chance I may not even feel these symptoms down the road? As I’m feeling pretty decent now? Thanks and good luck everyone, you got this!",2

1. my extremely vivid and entertaining dreams have now turned to nightmares that are not fun and make me sweat a lot
2. Saying ""I dont smoke weed"" makes things a lot easier than ""I cant smoke weed"" or ""Im quitting weed"" or really anything else.
3. god damnit i am sad and i am most sad at night. smoking just made me tired so i could control when i went to sleep, and now thats a bit harder and that sucks.
4. going to my shitty food service job sober sucks!!! my boss has been understanding (she doesnt know im not smoking, but she knows I am having a rough time right now) so that makes things a little better
5. weed made me not care about my health in terms of diet. I dont know how much ive lost, but I definitely have lost some weight because I don't munch every night and have been exercising to make it easier to fall asleep. so thats a pro.
6. still have a nasty cough. im not hacking up tar like the experiences of other people on this sub, but my god its still gross and phlegmy... 
7. finally, i am able to function a lot better on less sleep. i have always LOVED sleep a lot and prioritized getting 8+ hours (i will cancel plans to make sure this happens) but now I can function on 7.5 hours as well as i could on 9 hours when i was smoking pot. so thats cool.

It's been one hell of a month! (ok, not *quite* a month yet) Thinking back to 1st Jan, it feels like about 3 months have passed.

I've been using this sub as a diary to document my journey and progress. I found that in the first few weeks it kept me focused and helped me organize my thoughts, feelings, regrets and goals. I haven't felt the need to write on here for the last few days because, well, things are going fine.

I'm not gonna lie, some days are better than others, but now the bad days are bad because of non weed related problems. They are problems that have always been there, but I was using weed to suppress. Now I am actually facing them, and that's good, if slightly daunting at times. Once I pulled myself out of the initial anxiety and depression, I actually feel really positive about dealing with them. It's been a cleansing experience.

The nightmares and vivid dreams continue. My sex drive is up and down. My appetite is quite inconsistent and yes, there is still a feeling that something is missing. On a more positive note, I'm being super productive again. I've managed to stick to my exercise regime. I've lost weight and body is looking the best it has looked in many years. My eyes are less sunken and I generally look a lot healthier. I'm sleeping better and actually waking up feeling like I've had a good nights sleep. My mind is definitely sharper. I'm more communicative, friendly and sociable. I'm more proactive in getting chores done, rather than putting them off until they become a mountain to climb. I can actually do things like watching movies, enjoying hobbies, going to restaurants without feeling I'm missing out if I'm not stoned.

Of course this is not 'job done'. I'm sure there will still be cravings and bad days ahead. But I'm pretty confident I'm over the worst. Now it's about putting the pieces back together, which honestly,  isn't gonna be easy... but at least I'm actually doing it now.

For those at the start of their journeys... it's seems impossible to begin with... believe me, I felt the same.... but it is TOTALLY worth it. I'm genuinely surprised at the positive affect quitting has had on my body and mind. Big love to all of you in this community. Stay blessed :)",50

I’m trying to tell myself I don’t need it, it’s not worth it and I’ll regret it as soon as I do it. But I’m still tempted. And I still may.

I’ve been smoking daily for nearly 6 years. It’s become part of my persona, part of who I am. I can’t stop even when I want to. I can’t moderate — it never works that way. I feel like my only redeeming trait is that I’m a stoner, so obviously I must be ‘chill’. Without smoking weed, what is there to me? An awkward shell of a person who can’t even loosen up a little? Stoner is so deeply ingrained in who I am, I don’t even know what the purpose is beyond it. 

I live in a fog. I can feel the amount of cognitive decline that has occurred since I began smoking. I can’t keep a train of thought, my brain is always jumping from thing to thing and I can’t focus on anything. If I’m watching TV, I need my phone in my hand scrolling reddit, too. If I’m doing homework, I need music or Netflix playing in the background because when it’s empty of stimulation I’m endlessly bored. I want life to make me excited again. I want to want to do things. I want to get my work in on time. I want to be productive enough to be able to take time for myself without stressing about all of the responsibilities I’m neglecting. 

I want my social anxiety to go away. I want to make friends. I want to dedicate time to hobbies so I can meet likeminded people. But I work, smoke, and sleep. What kind of existence is that? I am such an adventurous person; I love the outdoors, I have a very active pooch who could run all day and still have enough energy to drive me crazy, I live in a place with endless outdoor recreation. I have an entire city to explore that I’ve only lived in for a year. But I smoke and my motivation to do anything vanishes. 

Where do I start? How do I feel okay without weed? How do I fill those gaps in my routine? What do I have to look forward to when I get home from work? What do I have to fill the void with my morning coffee? What do I do every time I leave the house to make me feel prepared?

It's nice to self reflect in a space I know is meant for this. So thanks for listening if you are so inclined to.

I decided about a month ago that I was quitting today. I changed my mind a couple times, but eventually made solid steps towards a real commitment. I told my main smoke buddy, and she agreed to not smoke around me, nor offer. I locked all my paraphernalia in a box, and stored it away. I took the week off work so that I didn't have to worry about insomnia.

The day has come. I woke up at 6 am because my cat was meowing and I usually smoke to fall back asleep in that case. But I couldn't, so I just got up. I cleaned my apartment, washed my face and brushed my teeth. Fed myself. These things are miniscule but they're things that would have been put off until 3 pm had I been smoking. I was bored by 9 am. It feels great. It feels so good it makes me want to smoke. 

Sobriety is hard because even once you're comfortable with it, (I wouldn't say that's me yet) it's still a habit for me to want to add weed to anything I already enjoyed. Even sobriety. I'm trying to talk myself out of it in the sneakiest way.

I’ve only just got reddit, I’ve been smoking for about 5 years but the last 2 years I’ve been doing it everyday, I’ve cut down from 4g a day to 1-2g a day but completely cutting weed off seems impossible, I feel so reliant on it and I get so bored I just think why not, I can’t afford to smoke it anymore as just recently I have dropped my hours at work to part time due to mental health, I physically now can not afford it and I’m worried I will get into debt for it as I did the same last year, I need some motivation or some ideas to keep my mind occupied, how are you guys getting on and how do you restrain yourself at weekend nights especially? 
Thanks :)",3

there are lots of good reasons to quit but those are what come to mind first lately. a couple weeks ago i quit for a a few days, went through pretty bad physical withdrawal and then started smoking again. all that pain for nothing! so i’m prepared to go through that again, although i’m wondering if i should try to taper down for a few days first. i’m not sure.

It has also been a big part of my relationship with my husband, which is part of the reason it is scary to give up. We were smoking buddies before we started dating. Now we have been together for 11 years and married for over 6. But I am very motivated my the biggest reason to give it up: we are going to try to have a baby. I've been just about a daily smoker ages 17 to 29, and will leave weed behind me before my 30th birthday coming up soon. My husband is going to quit for a few months to help his own mental health and assist me in the transition. We've both quit for months at a time before, but this time will be a true commitment to a lifestyle change.

Thank you.","I smoked for 22 years, through milestones, deaths, marriages, births, most of my life.  I was present for alot of it, but definitely not all of it. It started as experimentation and exploration, then as self medication, and then became addiction, though i never let myself think that until quite recently.  I've taken a break from smoking many times; this is the first time I've actually made the decision to quit. I almost lost my wife and my family, due to my lying about if and when i smoked. I'm thankful for her willingness to rebuild trust.

I'm also thankful for this community and all of you out there who have opened up and honestly shared your experiences. I've found myself opening up r/leaves and reading posts when i'm battling an urge, and i'm reminded of what i've been before and what i want to be. I've found myself in posts here, experiences no one knows i've had or things i've done. Your honesties have freed me to see parts of myself for the first time.

Today is day 59 since i quit. My life is better already. It's harder sometimes, but easier others.  I no longer have weed to manipulate my mood at will, i have to just deal with being tired or bored or lacking motivation when that happens. I've been battling spikes of anger, especially in the first weeks. I've had trouble sleeping through the night, even still. I have a drink now and then, but i'm actually terrified of alcohol, of it becoming a stand in; i've been avoiding it more recently, partly because of the fear, and partly because hangovers fucking suck (especially without weed to numb the fog).  I feel regret at the time lost.

But my mind is clearer now, even when i'm tired. I'm feeling more; more often, and more deeply. I sometimes catch myself unexpectedly moving to tears at some thoughts; which i appreciate. I'm not lying anymore. I'm present for my family. I'm sharper at work. I can connect with people and talk to them in ways i could never do before. I'm getting back to working through some very old and now thawing wounds. I'm happier.

I have the George Eliot quote on a wall in my house somewhere: ""It's never too late to be what you could have been"". It has meant different things to me at different times of my life. Now, it means being sober.

Thank you all.

We can do it.",86

At this point I’m just starting to give up. I mean I’m already a junior in high school and i have no life direction. I have no clue what i want to do for a living and ion even know what college I’m going to.

[My basic ass meditation app :p](https://reddit.com/link/euj0rt/video/vgbnfnis29d41/player)

Hey all! I was talking with my brother this weekend and he mentioned how he wants to start meditating again (he used to do it 20 minutes a day regularly) but he said it's so difficult to get started, and stick with it!  


So! I started working on an app this weekend to help with just that! There are plenty of meditation apps out there and they do a really good job at introducing people to meditation. What's going to make this different is the main focus is going to be on accountability.   


I am thinking of a platform that allows you to find other people who are trying to start a meditation practice, and then you can coordinate with them to find a time where you both can log on and start meditating.   


Imagine basically you logon, go to the meditation page, click ready, and wait for your partner to join (or if you don't have a partner yet, there will be a chat/ forum of some sort to find one!).  Once you both click ready, there will be a brief countdown before the sit starts, a gong will sound, and  the timer will begin.  At the end, there will be another gong sound and you will be done! Once done you can talk with your buddy about how it went, and jot down a few private notes for yourself as well. Then decide when you want to do it again, and go on your merry way!  


Realistically there is already something like this out there, but I wanted to work on my development skills and make something personal that my brother and I can use to try and get our practice started again.  


I am going to continue working on this, and would love to hear any suggestions you have! Who knows, maybe someday this will actually be a full fledged app!  


Best,

I've been a smoker for over half of my life (14 to 40), and I've been trying to quit for over *half of that time*. This little addiction of mine has cost me relationships, jobs, and has further pushed me into an isolated lifestyle that leaves me with much regret.

Like most of us here, I smoke on the daily, and multiple times at that. Basically, when I'm not high I don't know what to do with myself, and I hate life. But I DON""T WANT TO BE HIGH! It's maddening! I have no control over this! I have tried quitting so many times that I actually laugh at myself when I make another attempt. It's ridiculous, and I need help.

I've quit for stretches before in the past. Usually, it's due to a new relationship. Actually, It's always due to a new relationship. But, it would never last. I'd always go back, and it would always cause problems. I was never able to hold a relationship with a human being while holding a relationship with weed.

I'm not a spring chicken anymore, and I feel like I'm in the last moments of whatever chance I may have of actually living a normal life (I want a forever-lady and maybe even a kid, if I were to be convinced that I'm not too old). If I can't stop smoking for good, I'll never escape the isolation. I don't know what to do anymore, so I'm turning to you, Reddit. You're 'one of my only hopes'!",19

And idk what happened, but I soon became an every day smoker again. I've been meaning to quit but everytime I'm out of bud and decide too something happens and i have more. Like my friends or my girlfriend would give me some even if i said no and that I'm quitting. 

Well...i really need to put my foot down and stop, so i can pass a drug screen. My Dad works for a nuclear plant a little outside of town, and he was telling me that if I can pass a screen that I will most likely get an interview. Not trying to depend on my Dad or anything....but that's a pretty sweet gig. 401k, benefits, good pay. 

I guess I just need your advice on how to stop...again. I've done it  before and I can do it again. I know what to do, but this time is a bit different. I'm surrounded with more people who smoke. My girlfriend, our mutual friends, and friends from school. Any advice on how to still stay involved with these people and abstain from smoking? I know it sounds kinda dumb.",4

I used to enjoy being the stoner friend, grew up with that aesthetic as my role model for people i wanted to be like. 

But i'm really happy to say that it's been over a month sober, and last night was the first time i partied and i successfully was able to say no many times over to people trying to hand me lit joints. I was worried i wouldn't have enough resolve to stop. But i put away my paraphernalia and gave away my bong so i'd say i'm pretty proud of where i'm at.

the pros: ive started dreaming again, and so much. my sense of smell is coming back, more so when i don't smoke cigs which is trickier to kick but still doable. same thing with my short term memory. and i enjoy having, like, feelings! i'm not longer apathetic and love going to school functions sober. 

just want to share with a community that has inspired me and has helped me remember that i'm not better when I'm high and that the addiction is real. 

cheers & good luck friends!",22

During this time, the only thing I could think about was just wanting to smoke. As of right now, I have rejected the offer to smoke twice. Natural feelings of happiness and other emotions are beginning to be restored. I’m only on day 4, but I haven’t had any withdraws. I’m still a very far away from rewiring my brain, and I still feel foggy, but I’m further ahead in my success, or how I define it, than I have ever been. In commemoration of this new leaf, I have gave up over eating, got my ass back in the gym, and started nofap. I want my body to be restored to its equilibrium state with no external negative stimuli acting upon me. I love this community and feel very close to everyone in it. Thank you guys for being so supportive. We can all do this. Even though society encourages this drug, they may not have seen the dark that can come from it. I’m tired of living life in a haze.

Because it’s a weekend I thought I’d go wild and have a half a cup of coffee. I’m so buzzed I feel like my skin is crawling and I feel so uncomfortable in my body.

I ended up being really sick every time I smoked and it was interfering with my work and social life.

I am so excited to be a non-smoker (I quit cigs at the same time) and I finally understand how my friends manage it in a legal state when I live 2 blocks away from two different dispos. 

I don't necessarily have greater savings or anything, but I have much more money for quality groceries and special produce that I couldnt afford before. Waking up to a mango in the morning is such a special pleasure! And having a full meal for dinner instead of whatever I could throw together feels really special. 

This commhnity has been very helpful, and I have no plans of leaving. Seeing all the struggle posts reminds me of where I was and makes me wanting to give support while the success posts I finally relate to and gives me hope that one day I will be a year free!

I'm 44 now, and I've just been through one of the hardest years of my life. I'm from Paradise, CA and lost my home, my business, everything in the Camp fire a little over a year ago. It's been one of those years where you have to take a hard look at your life and go, ""fuck...it's time to make some big changes. If I can go through THIS, I can conquer just about anything."" I've been doing the BIG work, tons of soul searching, meditation, spiritual work, etc etc. So now, I'm finally ready and feeling MADLY confident in my conviction to also conquer THIS dragon...weed.
I've hated that I've been a pot head for so long. I was a highly functional smoker...wake, bake, go to gym, slay...but then always crashing and needing to nap, drink more coffee, or smoke so much I could keep chasing that high so I wouldn't crash. 
I'm almost a month clean and finally feeling GOOD coming out of this cloudy detox. It's been rough. I've wanted to punch walls, scream, cry, and just fucking rage often this month. Detox is hard. Emotions come to the surface I've been smoking away for YEARS. But the good news is,  I'm feeling damn PROUD of myself for this past month.
You see, even though on the outside people saw me as a successful person, I've hated my habit. I've loathed myself for sneaking away to smoke all the time...hiding from my daughter and hoping she wouldn't ever catch me...she's 8 now.
The longest I was sober was while I was pregnant with her. I remember that first smoke after having her, and swore I wouldn't fall back into old habits. Well, that didn't last.
I've been reading all of your posts and it has helped me immensely. I felt I wanted to finally share my story. I believe it will be one of success. I've realized that  I cannot be a 'casual' smoker. I wish I could. But, for now it is just saying no to weed every single day. That's all I can focus on.
If anything, the BEST bad ass part of all of this is self love. Learning to be authentically proud of myself and my choices. This has been a battle for so long and I just KNOW I've got it this time.
Don't give up friends. Feeling good about YOU and the way you live this precious life is worth the struggle.

I was in 3rd grade, 9 years old, the first time my dad (who was drunk as usual) handed me a lit joint. I breathed that hot smoke deeply into my young sensitive lungs as I’d seen him do many times. I immediately fell into a severe coughing fit. My dad laughed as if it were the funniest thing he’d ever seen. I remember distinctly feeling ashamed and thinking that one day I’d be a real man like him and be able to hold in that hot smoke. Thus began my decades long interest, fascination, and ultimate infatuation with this plant, this drug. 

I started using marijuana (and drinking, and cigarettes) regularly by the time I was 14 all with my parents approval and even encouragement. By the time I was 17 I could hold my drink and smoke with any man. I thought at the time (as did my delinquent friends) that my parents were  cool for this, but in retrospect I realize that they basically saddled my immature, undeveloped mind with these addictions and, as a consequence, I entered into adulthood at a huge disadvantage. Needless to say, I still carry around hurt, confusion, and anger towards them for this. 

Fortunately for me I met and married a great gal at 23 who made me want to become a better man and basically saved my life. I quit smoking cigarettes at age 25, the morning my son was born. Threw a nearly full pack in the dumpster behind the hospital and never looked back. I continued to drink and smoke weed heavily though. My wife, who has never used any substance, disapproved of my use but was extraordinary patient with me. I guess she saw something in me under all my exterior mess, something I was unable to even see in myself. 

I had an epiphany of sorts on my 30th birthday and, in what seems like a flash of insight, realized with crystal clarity that my health was THE most valuable possession that I would ever own and vowed from that moment forward to take an active ownership in my own health. I was very overweight and unfit and had high blood pressure, a future heart attack in the making. I quit drinking that day and never touched it again. It was tough as hell but next month will be 11 years of sobriety from alcohol. 

I started exercising daily (mostly running and cycling) and changed my relationship with food and went from 220 to 155 pounds in one year and have maintained this healthier weight ever since. 
Marijuana though proved,  and still proves, to be my hardest chemical crutch to hang up for good. I think it’s because it was so deeply ingrained into my psyche from such a young age. Everything just seemed so drab and uninteresting without it. I’ve quit weed many times over the past 10 years (hence my username), several of those times for over 1 year, once for over 2 years. I always seem to manage, though, regrettably, to find a way to return to this long lost love of mine. That’s the irresistible seductive power of this drug for me. I reach a point in my sobriety where I truly begin to feel joy and contentment in life without weed, and then, as if I forget why I quit, I pick it up again, only to quickly realize again why I quit in the first place. It’s a love/hate relationship, an abusive relationship, a viscous cycle. 

Throughout this whole process, I’ve fortunately been able to keep this side of me hidden from my son, who has no idea about this aspect of my life and would be shocked and confused if he were to ever find out. 

Last summer my 14 year old son and I rode bikes (bicycles) all the way across the country from Mexico to Canada, 2,400 miles, mostly on remote dirt roads, along the spine of the Rockies thru the states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. It took us 49 days and was an absolutely incredible experience for us both. We carried everything with us on our bikes and slept under the stars most nights. I wanted to show him, among other things, that you don’t need to have drugs and alcohol to have a good time. Something my own father failed miserably at teaching me. 

I hit my one year weed-free mark (again) while on that epic journey with my son and was very proud of myself for doing so because the cravings and opportunity for using were certainly present along the way, especially in Colorado. 

In what was really a sweet and generous gesture, my dad called me out of the blue and said he wanted to make the long 3 day drive to the Canadian border and pick us up instead of us taking the train home as we had planned. It was very nice of him. But here’s the thing, there are many things that trigger my impulsive urge to smoke weed, but none more powerful than the presence of my dad. I strongly associate the presence of my dad with smoking weed and, knowing this, worried that I would be unable to resist the urge during the long drive home. 

It wasn’t 30 minutes down the road when we stopped at a rest area. While my dad and son were using the rest room, I opened the glove box and grabbed my dad’s little tin box that I knew would be there. I quickly loaded a bowl and took 4 or 5 deep tokes and was almost instantly awash with that old familiar euphoric embrace mixed with equal parts shame and guilt. I smoked with my dad at the motel later on that night and again early the next morning and again the following night and morning but haven’t smoked again since. Even just smoking those 5 times brought about a period of withdrawals for me. . .anxiety, depression, etc. It only left me wanting more and more and more and MORE! Moderation for me, simply isn’t an option. Once is too many and a thousand times isn’t enough. 

I’m sitting here now with 6 months of complete sobriety and, though I do still think about and crave weed, I generally feel pretty good and have definitely reached a place where non-chemically-stimulated joy and contentment have returned to life. The addicted mind is a sneaky little persistent bastard and I feel now more than ever before that I’ve finally managed to wrap my hands around its slippery little neck and put it out of its self-induced misery once and for all. :)

If you’ve made it this far thank you for allowing me to share my story. Believe it or not I tried to keep it as brief as possible and left a lot of stuff out. I should write a book. ;) 

I love that folks from all backgrounds and walks of life can come here to this great community to give and receive encouragement and support to one another no matter where we happen to be in our shared struggle to break free from the chain that binds us. Much love and stay strong, friends! ❤️💪",820

For people feeling lost in life, I'm here for you.","I've  taken a 90 day weed break before, the 1st ever, about a year ago. Cold  turkey for 3 months. It was good but, too long for me. I'm looking to  manage my weed usage like a ""normal"" person. I'm an artist, so I enjoy  the positive effects it can have for creativity etc. Looking to stop  using it like a habitual addiction, which has a lot of negative effects  for me. Having gone totally sober before and knowing what that's like,  it's hard to find the right balance, and stick to it. There may not even  be balance for someone like me, may be I either use it or don't.

Ideally I'd like to use it twice a week in single small sessions. Consciously with intent, at the right time.

Much more usage than this, and I'll fall back into the daily habit easily.

I've  been blazing for 15 years, most of that has been every day. While we're  at it, I'm addicted to porn/masturbation and videogames.

Some of you will know how my day starts:

* Wake up, tired.
* Stay in bed for hours looking at phone.
* Sometimes masturbate during this sleep-in, if so, waste dopamine.
* Go back to sleep for an hour as I'm too tired (again).
* Force myself to get up around midday.
* Eat, coffee, weed.
* Try and be productive, sometimes succeed, often fail  
(the fact I've orgasmed and gotten high gives this feeling of: peak reached, everything thereafter is a tired afterthought)
* Usually spend the rest of the day lazily not achieving anything substantial
* Endlessly go on Tinder, etc looking for someone to love me
* Eat, weed, videogames & repeat
* If I'm feeling low, throw in a couple hours of listening to sad music and feeling miserable
* Stay up late, fall asleep.

Some  of you will throw alcohol/cigarettes/gambling and other drugs into that  cocktail, thankfully I was never really into them, hence I am making  this post in [r/leaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/), even though my larger point is that this is more about managing multiple addictions.

What's  missing from list? Socializing, physical activity, leaving comfort  zone, adventures, hard work, travel, eating out, going to parties, hell I  couldn't even do normal things like attend a funeral or go to a  birthday party.

This is coming  from someone who has a natural lust for life, loves creating art and  although introverted, enjoys having best friends, partners and humans  close by.

And for the life of me,  the biggest thing here, is I cannot follow my dreams and passions. I  cannot get ahead in anything I try that isn't sinking deeper into  nothingness. I guess that's my point. I'm 30 years old and I'm trying to  reset my life, yet again. To make things worse, the last 2 years I've  have finally experienced decent depression & anxiety, to the point  of when I get low, I can't stop thinking suicidal thoughts. It's not  like it use to be where I could bounce back, but I have to.

The burst of inspiration I have has been months of thoughts without action, based on trial and error.

I  plan to move to a new city, immediately slow down my weed usage until  I've weened off it (dangerous, I know, but I've done cold turkey before,  not for me) go to the gym everyday (universal advice is exercise is a  superb replacement for any addiction, I've felt it when I did my first  gym stint), lay off the porn, keep making peace with being alone, not  look for a partner obsessively, let a connection happen naturally and  WORK HARD for my art.

For people with habits and multiple addictions, what has worked for you?  
For anyone else feeling lost, feel free to say anything you need to get off your chest.  
I haven't spoken to anyone like this in months, writing it all out already makes me feel a little better  
Thank you.",1

But since I'm not sure what day I'm on its actually made it easier to get over the mental blocks. I'm pretty sure I've made it past day 5 now (not positive) and I'm still going strong. I've smoked my ""last bowl/j/blunt"" many many times now, but I think always making it a momentous occasion put too much pressure on me. I usually tell my bf and roommates ""IM DONE FOR GOOD!"" just to smoke again a few days later it makes me feel like shit. This time I haven't mentioned it to anyone, just kept it movin'. I think treating it like less of a big deal has made it less of a big deal in my monkey mind.

2020-01-25 09:09:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/etr6oz/almost_4_months_sober_just_my_contribution/,Almost 4 months sober. Just my contribution,"Hello, friends.   


I wanted to share a bit about my story with cannabis. When I was trying to quit, it was very helpful to me to sometimes just browse this community and read people's stories, so I figured I'd do something like that...  


I started smoking in college. What first was once a month became every weekend, then that became every other night, then that eventually became every day. During the period between 2014-2016, I had a moderate use that I thought did not affect me too much, and it was manageable. From 2016 onwards, my girlfriend also acquired the habit and then she and I started smoking pretty much everyday. It was incredible during the beginning. Just to have that escape, every night, felt right. Smoke, eat, relax, go to sleep. It made things much easier. I didn't have to worry about what was I doing, if I was spending every second of free time mindlessly scrolling social media or with cheap youtube videos. That thing people say about pot making you feel okay with being bored was very true for me.   


It also helps social situations. In a short time, you are friends with only other smokers. The anxiety you might feel about any social interaction, that can go away in 5 minutes when you get with these friends, because, let's be honest, that's the longest you guys can stay before lighting it up. I always felt that any interaction before lighting it up was just small talk and everyone was just waiting to get high as soon as possible.   


My everyday use soon became a problem. I just felt anxious all the time when I was not using. I would spend the day worried about anything, about stupid things, or even about important things, but I was becoming unable to relax without it. Every thing became 3x harder. Worried about this, worried about that. Without it, it was just anxiety and tight chest all the time. It was around 2017 that I discovered this amazing community and reading the posts and discussions opened a new world for me. I could see other people were in the same situation and now I finally had a road to follow, a name to give to all that I was feeling. I realized I was an addict.   


I decided to quit during the end of 2017. Needless to say, I failed a lot. At march 2018 I was already back to smoking everyday. I moved to a new city and quickly became friends with smokers again. Convinced myself that the issues were other things, not pot. Obsviously, all these issues of anxiety just snowballed. In October of last year, I had a horrible panic attack while hight and that experience was so incredibly awful that I had to confront my problems and think about my life. I'm almost 4 months clean now.   


I really feel the hardest part of quitting is handling the issues you were hiding before. I do not mean this as a discouragement, but your problems do not simply go away after you quit. In fact, they may become more present. I am dealing with some nasty anxiety for these past months, had a couple of panic episodes. But the definitive thought for me is that going back to that abusive use of cannabis will not solve a thing. The ""leaver"" road might be though, but you are only on it because you know the other road cannot solve your problems.   


I want to thank the community for the amazing people you are. Sorry for the long text or any english mistakes. Hugs and kisses to all.",36

(hope it's ok to post).,"I've been a smoker for about a decade. Over the past week or two I've gone from multiple sessions daily, starting from waking up and ending when back in bed, to essentially vaping 0 or 1 times per day. I know most users here are more in favor of the cold turkey method but, I've had a history with other (read: harder) substances so I've sort of been through this rodeo, and found when committed that policing myself and drastically reducing intake over time allowed me to ultimately quit entirely when I get my body and brain used to a very low usage. That's just what seems to work for me personally, not advice for anyone else.

Last night I have some drinks with my usual group of friends. I've moved away but they live in my hometown, so I slept at my mom's house there after hanging. I make one serious mistake in forgetting to take my allergy pill before bed (I'm highly allergic to cats/dogs, mom has a dog, that + drinking = extreme stuffy head/slow brain for me).

Anyway... on to the dream...a lot of fuzzy details and randomness but this is the most succinct version:

It starts off with the same group of friends, including my older brother, hanging, drinking, etc. and that night ends. At some point I see my car, its at the front of my mom's neighborhood totaled. Next scene I'm essentially hanging with those same friends again. My brother and close friend are playing a fighting game on a PS4 and we're all hanging out on a couch.

I’m like wtf is up with my car and nobody wants to tell me. Eventually I get out of someone that I got into an accident that killed several people but I have no recollection of it and I insist, no I just went to bed after we hung out why would I go out and drive. 

There’s like other people in the room/area with us but I don’t really notice. Everyones talking about the new horror movie that came out like the ring/grudge type of shit but I keep trying to get out of my friends what happened and they’re super hesitant. 

Turns out I actually have partial amnesia from the crash and I’ve asked them this question so many times before and it just makes them sad but they answer. Brother and close friend are playing ps4 so much because its the game in the waiting area thing of the hospital that I’m in. The nurse won’t allow me to leave but she like runs the wing and everyone thinks she’s sweet/great. 

At some point I realize I have to confront her to escape so I get in her face and her eyes turn black and her tongue grows out and shit and nobody would believe me….. somehow I got out and woke up, I don’t really remember after that though.

And that's why I say holy shit, you guys were not kidding.",3

I've tried to quit countless times before to now avail but I am here to try and try again.   


I'm 26M and I've been smoking heavily for the past 4 years.

I'd like to use this time at home as a time of reflection and correction- getting myself back to a better place post-grad school as I've certainly picked up a lot of bad habits in that time. The first thing that has to go is the marijuana. I've spent far too long under its spell, draining my bank account and losing weeks at a time to mindless gaming and at this stage in my life I really don't have time to be messing around.

2020-01-25 07:14:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/etq37f/quitting_feels_like_heartbreak/,Quitting feels like heartbreak.,"I'm currently on day 25 and came to a realisation a couple of days ago but wanted to sit on the idea before sharing it:

Personally, the best example I can give (other than just saying I feel anxious and depressed) is that I feel heartbroken. When a relationship breaks down with someone, or when a family member passes or a much loved pet, that sickening feeling your body feels when trying to adjust to the situation is somewhat identical to the feeling of no longer having weed in your life.

Weed was that warm hug when you were sad, the thing that got you out of bed in the morning, the thing that made social situations that much more enjoyable; it gave you a reason to be happy and it was a feeling you're constantly chasing... somewhat the exact feelings you would get when you're ""in-love"". You had a bad day? Your loved ones would be your go-to, the same way weed was my go-to.

I could be put in the most horrible, awkward situations but as long as I had my weed, the same way a young child needs their mother or father, the feeling becomes less scary. Now you're no longer smoking, you're going through the heartbreak of losing something you love. The more addicted you were, the longer it'll take for your heart and body to mend and adjust to the new lifestyle of living ""single"", or free from weed in this case.

If you're reading this and think I'm chatting absolute shit then you're probably right, but in my mind, it makes total sense. I've had girlfriends in the past that I loved (I might not have been IN-LOVE with them but I loved them for sure) and the gut-wrenching feelings I would have when these relationships broke down are somewhat identical to the feelings I'm now experiencing now I'm sober.

Your body and mind are mending, and you're in complete control over what direction you want to go in with it. These things can take weeks, months or years, and there's no shame in taking longer than others. You'll mend when you're meant to mend. Sending love to everyone and hope you have a strong, fulfilled and happy weekend, no matter what you're currently going through.",255

If you're considering quitting / taking an absence / whatever, read on and let me inspire you.

I've got every fucking reason to smoke. By now I've thought of them all. But I keep coming back here to read advice and other people's story and it has KEPT ME on the path.

Its the longest I've gone since 2009. I'm already feeling like a different person. I've lost weight (down to 175 lbs for the first time since highschool), I don't feel the need to drink.

My ex and I were able to level with eachother about a three year relationship that nosedived (for no clear reason, but WE know it was the weed)

I'm back in the dating scene and people connect to me on a WHOLE new level that feels empowering. Like I am who I really want to be.

Finally, my mom and I have such a better relationship, which is important to me because she has a terminal illness. But having her in my court, helping me follow my real dreams (I'm starting a home-based music studio) feels like a huge shift.

This was EVERY bit the transformation I wanted it to be. If you're still considering it - I recommend it highly. You'll learn so much about yourself especially if you've been a chronic smoker like me.

EDIT: Thank you so much for commenting. It's really helping me feel validated and optimistic about making changes. I'm going to talk to the people who are close to me and I am going to look into finding good mental healthcare nearby. It means a lot in this vulnerable moment I am in. Thank you!!!

&#x200B;

I didn't know it could get this bad. Last night I had a panic attack so bad that I had to go to the hospital. I had made an edible with hash and it was too strong, I thought I had accidentally taken heroin and that I was dying. Thankfully that wasn't the case.

I feel so guilty for taking up the emergency workers time, I felt like I was actually losing my mind. I just remember groaning and throwing up and constantly asking them if I was going to die. I don't know what having a psychotic break is like, but that felt like I was totally out of control of myself and my actions. my heart rate was at 160bpm and wasn't going down and I was shaking.

I know I have anxiety issues. I've had panic attacks in the past. On one hand this makes me think that it might be worse and maybe there's other things going on in my brain that I need to take care of, but at the same time I have a tendency to catastrophize and be a hypochondriac (hence, calling emergency last night), so maybe this is just what regular anxiety disorders can be like sometimes? But then at the same time I feel like I often minimize things that are more serious than I think they are. I don't know. I feel like I can't trust myself and my own thinking anymore. I've never really had a good diagnosis.

I recently moved to another continent to go to grad school. I live in a house with a bunch of roommates who I don't speak to pretty much ever. I have a small group of colleagues at my school, but my close friends, my family, and my girlfriend are all back home. I don't think I can tell my parents, I'm worried they would take drastic action like try and get me to fly home. They already are under so much stress supporting the rest of the family. I just can't let them have more to worry about every day, it would be too much. My girlfriend will probably call me later and I should tell her about it but I'm just so ashamed. She's just so amazing and I don't want her to have to worry about me. I don't know if I can.

So I guess I'm just venting on Reddit. I've known that I need to stop taking THC for years now, I've known I have an unhealthy relationship with it, I've recognized that it has damaged my motivation and my interest in the world around me, and that I use it to self medicate. I hope that this time I can finally figure out what causes me so much pain that I feel like I need to spend my time high. I guess I'm grateful that I have never tried to move on to even more dangerous substances. I think I need therapy but I don't know how to start or if I can afford it.

I don't know, thanks for listening to my rambly post. At the very least it was helpful for me to just type all this out. This is just the day after and I don't know how to process all this.",18

I was never really an addict, but I wanted to slow down before I ended up getting there, and after a while I ended up just kind of quitting because it was stressing me out more to try to moderate. I've been off for maybe 4 months now, and I'm just getting to a point where things are getting a lot better. The thing is, I don't know how many of my problems were caused by smoking as many of them were present long after I quit and many have been with me my whole life, and were simply exacerbated by use. I'm also a musician and I went through a period where I couldn't even listen to any musicians who smoked weed. Now I'm starting to get over that and I guess I'm just worried that theres some chance that once all my reasons for stopping go away or are to the point where I really feel better (anxiety, depression, knowing I can make good music without it) I will not have as strong of a reason to continue not smoking and will start again. Have any of you been through this? Thanks.

I picked up Judith Grisel's ""Never Enough"" after seeing a number of posters recommend it, and wanted to share a few passages from the chapter on marijuana that really resonated for me. For context, Grisel was a hardcore addict who managed to recover and then became a neuroscientist who studies addiction.

*""I loved the taste, the smell, and the fabulous buffering effects separating me from the messy business of interacting with other people and fulfilling my daily obligations as, at the same time, weed lent promise of something new and glittering in the midst of the unappealing present. As an antidote to boredom, the drug made everything more interesting, and time and space delightful instead of threatening. An introvert to begin with, I loved spending hours stoned on the beach...""*

*""It seems that \[endocannabinoids\] evolved...to modulate normal activity, highlighting important neurotransmission. The normal activity of the brain, as we’ve discussed, mediates all of our experiences, thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. The cannabinoid system helps to sort our experiences, indicating which are the most meaningful or salient. The system activates naturally to distinguish input that might contribute to our flourishing—for instance, a good source of food, a potential mate, or other meaningful connections, information, or stimuli....*

*This should make it easy to understand why the stimuli we encounter when stoned are so intensely rich. Sights, sounds, tastes, and thoughts that might otherwise be average take on incredible attributes. Early in my love affair with pot, I remember finding Rice-A-Roni so astoundingly delicious I couldn’t imagine how it stayed on the shelves of the grocery stores. Today I’d have to be backpacking for at least a week before I’d even find it palatable, but with my synapses primed for import, food is exceptional, music transcendent, concepts mind-blowing....*

*Unfortunately, there is a dark side to all this neural spotlighting. If everything is highlighted as meaningful, then nothing can really stand out. What use is a watering can after all, if the fields are flooded? The lack of contrast disables the sorting machinery that helps us make sense of our environment by separating relevant from irrelevant. After one comes down, the lack of sorting makes it hard to recall the wonderful urgency of those experiences.*

*The other downside is that on rare occasions when I was not high, I could barely feign interest in anything....""*

That was fun you know but when you're honest, in the end it wasn't really fun anymore. And now it's hard and you have to maybe concentrate so hard to not smoke but at least you have a task again and that can be a good thing.

2020-01-24 17:13:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ethjhw/a_day_by_day_breakdown_of_my_quit_so_far/,A day by day breakdown of my quit so far,"I smoked daily for three years with a 60-day or so quit this summer, after which I relapsed.  Prior to that quit, I had progressed to nearly waking and baking, with the exception of at work.  After my relapse, I was able to keep enough control to only smoke in the evenings.  My plan was to quit New Years but that didn't happen.  I finally was able to get through my Day 1 on 1/14/20  (EDIT: I originally posted 1/13 but that was the last day I smoked).  So here is how it has gone so far.

- Day 1 - Hardest part about this day is just getting through it without lighting up.  However when it comes to quitting I've always found it the most difficult to not smoke.  If I make it through the first day it's easier to say no to later urges to smoke.

- Day 2 - I actually felt pretty good this day.  As with Day 1, physical and mental withdrawal had not set in yet but it was easier to say no to smoking that evening.

- Day 3 - This was a great day.  I started to feel more mentally and physically alert.  The fog of my last bowl was finally lifting but the physical withdrawal had not begun yet.  It was easy to say no to smoking this day because I really liked how I was feeling.  This is the day I started to think how much better being sober actually felt.

- Day 4 - This was the day the physical withdrawal really began.  Depression and existential dread kicked in.  Anger and irritability started to kick in.  I was less alert and had more brain fog than Day 3.  This is the day that the true process of quitting began.

- Day 5 - Awful, extremely stressful day.  At that point it was the worst day yet, compounded by a terrible day at work.  It was the closest I've come to smoking since I quit.  I actually planned to smoke that night but when I got home and could do so, I was able to stay strong and just go to bed.

- Day 6 - What makes this day stand out in particular is the brain fog.  I could hardly hold together my thoughts that day nor could I hold a coherent conversation.  I felt like I was losing my mind.

- Day 7 - My first day I felt a little better.  Brain fog was less that day and I felt less depressed. I had a clearer mind and I could feel my social skills improving.  I was thinking to myself maybe the worst was over.  How wrong I was.

- Day 8 - Nothing too memorable about this day.  Felt a little lethargic but nothing too bad.  However, towards the end of the day I became extremely angry about having to quit.  I was committed to quitting but I was trying to convince myself it was all for external reasons (which there's some truth to) and not internal ones.

- Day 9 - Literally one of the worst days of my life from a mental perspective and the worst day of this quit so far.  You can read about it here.  https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/esrvaw/going_into_day_10_literally_one_of_the_worst/

- Day 10 - A better day.  I was able to keep a handle on myself and control my anxiety for most of the day.  It also wasn't too bad from a brain fog perspective until the end of the day when it hit with a vengeance.

- Day 11 (today) - Much worse than yesterday but not as bad as Day 9.  Today I'm having trouble with misspelling words.  Brain fog is pretty brutal right now, almost as bad as Day 6.  Very high anxiety as well.  This afternoon heavy fatigue has set in.  Considering cancelling my social plans tonight to just go to bed.

I will continue to chronicle this as I progress through the days in order to keep track of my improvement.",8

\- Walked through one of the most dangerous streets in the city I lived in at the time to meet a dealer in an underpass, to then have to walk back through that same street again carrying my gear.

\- Got my mate to hide 5 pre-rolled J's one Christmas in the side-alley of my parents house just so I could get high when returning from Uni.

\- Allowed 3 dealers (who I'd met only a few times) to bag up over an ounce on my bedroom floor at Uni, just because they gave me some free gear for doing so.

\- Took pay-day loans out to afford weed because I'd maxed out my £1500 overdraft and had no money until payday (This happened multiple times).

They're just a few points, but c'mon, like seriously?! I'd never even THINK about doing any of that now that I'm sober. I'm disgusted in myself as a person for even thinking at the time that those actions were somewhat acceptable.",18

2020-01-24 10:42:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/etc1uc/just_wanted_to_share_my_long_term_quitting/,"Just wanted to share my long term, quitting marijuana story. Over 3 years sober from pot, but the overall journey was way longer than that.","Hey friends. It’s been a very long time since I’ve posted, probably from a different username too. 


Let’s start from the beginning. I started smoking pot when I was 14 and some change. It helped me deal with the hardships that were going on at home. My parents separated when I was 9, but remained in a custody battle for years upon years. I went to live with my Dad when I was 13, in the woods. In a rural area where you could get away with stuff. My friend and I tried weed when we were 14 and I continued smoking all the way through high school. Smoking alone, with friends, the whole nine yards. 


By 18 I read some articles that suggested that it negatively affected my brain. I got fucking terrified. In addition to that, I had brain fog and the visual snow, which lead to significant anxiety all of the time. 


At 18 I quit smoking pot for 2 years until I turned 20, when I had a good job and picked it up once again. Throughout this time this community helped me substantially. I was on it every day looking for support, and lending support to some of you. 


After I picked it up again, I probably smoked occasionally for the next two years, but the same fears started to strike my mind. After I turned 22 I decided to quit marijuana and alcohol. I stayed off of alcohol for about 2 years, picked it up and have been drinking occasionally since then. Although I never picked up pot again. 


I’ve been clean from marijuana for 3 years. It helps that I have a different job now that could drug test after an incident, and that further inspires me to stay away from it even though I’ve lived in a legal state for a year now. 


So 3 years and 2 months now. I think my point of telling you this story is to point out that this is a long term journey if you decide to quit. I do not have the brain fog anymore, and I’m pretty pleased with how I’ve turned out, despite choosing to engage in smoking when I was so young for so long. 


Anyway, it’s amazing to see how this community has grown so much. Even when there were only a few thousand on this subreddit it’s always been a very supportive community. 


 in addition to that",34

I have had a let's say rural few years being off and on weed. Today I decided to do the math and investigate my bank account (since it's legal I can see all transactions I made). Another motivation to stay healthy and off this substance. Don't get me wrong, weed has given me time to reflect and experience. But eventually you will learn it was giving you time that you didn't really have or had to spend differently.

To everybody on this platform, I salute you. You have made the step by acknowledging you want change to happen. It's a slippery slope. But with time and persistence everyone can change his rusted ways.

Shopkeer said: ""the coke cans are now 95 pence"". I said whaaat? ""Ok I will find a less expensive can of alternative"" and though to myself 'why am I doing this' and declared to shopkeeper ""this is a sign from God, I was not meant to have this sugar, God bless' and left with my 90 pence.

Improvement! Of course I had cravings but the insidious cravings ""you have been really bored today and are doing so well, you can do it just once, tomorrow is a new day"".

I have been hacking up and I thought of my gravity bong glass bottle caked with brown gunk and thought ""NO!! WHO IS ASKING THE QUESTION?!""

I’ll be honest, I’ve been trying to quit since I graduated college, and this is the farthest I’ve ever got. I have 1 person to thank, and this forum. Someone a while back posted about gaining your freedom, it really hit home. I’m a big guy, and a former college athlete, always down to compete, always down to fight but, I could never fight myself, and my addiction. After joining leaves I tried multiple times and still couldn’t get past day 1 until I read that post. 

I see a lot of self doubters, and I use to be one of you guys but after the first 5 days, I gained a confidence that I can do this. I probably went through every emotion, especially hate, and the feeling that I wasted 17 years of my life. Absolute wasted potential. 

I got to look towards the future now, what’s done is done. With a solid two weeks down, I’m super focused on self improvement and I hope you guys do the same. I had some withdrawals, I just got past the lack of sleep, and night sweats but I have to say my routine has helped me push through.

The routine, always strive for greatness, always strive for improvement. Workout hard every day, eat delicious bomb Whole Foods, educate yourself, rather it’s podcast, articles, or books, go outside, and get lost in this beautiful world. If your stuck at home lose yourself in a good tv series or video game. 

My mouth still salivates when I think about some nug, and I think about smoking but, this time I say no, I’m down to fight for my freedom, I’m down to improve. It will get better, I constantly dream about the dope career I’m going to have, the extra money, the brain cognition, THE FREEDOM.",17

I'm calling tomorrow to see if I can get into a program or group at the health care facility I go to. I've been in and out of another treatment program and twelve step groups, but always retreat back to my temporary comfort zone of Marijuana.

I feel so bland. I feel dull. I am half of what I could be. I keep returning to this. 

This idea of powerlessness I've heard over and over in 12 Step Culture. What the fuck does it mean, actually? I have heard people admit they were powerless over alcohol...but in what way? 

To me, I can say that it's been proven over and over that I cannot manage my using. Despite my denial while using. It overtakes my life. 

I'm so scared I will relapse. I'm so scared that I will not have anything but Marijuana in my life. I have a black hole inside of me. I feel so empty, and this drug gives me a relief from the emptiness for a while, while making me more empty. It's so fucked. Addiction is so fucked. It's insanity.

You guys get it. This drug can be addicting. It can be absolutely destructive for some people. We're all living proof of that. 

My only close friend lives in Germany. She has multiple sclerosis. Her health declined and I haven't heard from her in like 2 years. I have no close friends. I have no job. No meaningful life. I simply smoke, and live in misery.

I started an antidepressant a couple weeks ago. I'm hoping it will give me the little nudge I need to do the things I want in life. 

I feel so stuck. So powerless.

 I can't quit quitting just because of a relapse. It happened, and now I need to deal with life. 

Sometimes, though...all I see is darkness. It's the depression. I'm swimming in darkness right now.

2020-01-23 16:23:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eszp1s/addicted_couple/,Addicted couple,"  My girlfriend and I smoke around a half ounce or more every week between the two of us, it's been like this for about 3 years,  I haven't been sober for a full day in at least that long, and I'm only 21. I started smoking as much as I could get my hands on in grade 10 and I've been going since, same with her. It caused us both a lot of trouble in school and with family,  I managed to get my act together enough to pass but barely. In my final week of high school my mom left the province for an exciting job opportunity so my girlfriend (who was already living with us) and I moved out to a small town where I had gotten a job (3 years ago).  I dont know how much of that is relevant but that's the sitch.

   I want to stop smoking, out right, I know I can't keep going with any kind of control. So far I haven't done anything to achieve that though, I beat myself up about it while I'm sober at work every day but when I get home I still have a toke, all the stuff just sitting on the table has me loading one out of habit. I just put everything in the other room and I'm hoping  that'll do me until my girlfriend gets home from work in a few hours. I'm sure I could force myself to not pick up and go dry that way but when I talk to her about it she says she just wants to cut down how much we smoke.  I said off-hand last night ""we could save so much if we didn't smoke weed"", she replied with ""I don't like when you say things like that.  We DO smoke weed"". That response really hammered it home to me that she doesn't want to stop.  I don't really know what to do, obviously talk to her more but I'm not sure what I'm looking for from that conversation.  General wisdom says you can't convince somebody to quit an addiction, so do I ask her to go smoke in the other room? That feels rude to me and who knows if it'll work. Something else maybe? There's a part of me that knows our lifestyles may not line up well if she continues being a chronic user and I stop.  

 Thank you to anyone reading this. I would love to hear from somebody who has been in a similar situation and how it played out.

2020-01-23 15:23:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/esysyt/the_first_few_minuteshere_we_go/,The first few minutes...here we go!,"Hello all,

I just found this thread today and am so glad.

I’ve been sober for a few minutes now! Just downloaded I Am Sober  app too.

A lil bit: Been smoking daily for about 15 years (I’m 35). I’m in therapy, meditate, etc but can’t kick the habit (need to get my exercise up but I’ve been working on that slowly).  Also, lung collapsed almost 5 years ago spontaneously...so I started to vape.

I am separated from my partner of 13.5 years, it has been the hardest times of my life. Coming out as gay or too gay for a straight monogamous heterosexual relationship definitely brought some feelings.

So needlessly to say my weed consumption increased even more. Started showing up to work high...waking up at 3am, 4am and getting high to try to sleep again.
All day...vaping, spending money, always high.  I’ve lied to cover it up.

So it’s been one week since I stopped with the vape and went back to some flower and CBD since those two feel less strong and get me less high. The habit, the desire to frequently use remains.

But as of a few minutes ago, I’m done with those too.

I have tried and failed...all with as much compassion as I can muster. Insomnia may be the hardest part. Coming home at night...the companionship of the high is what I’ll be dealing with tonight.

But I want to dream again. I want to know that my brain is deeply processing my emotional memory. I want to deeply heal on my own. I’m a musician with lots to practice and learn so I want to keep growing and being disciplined. I’m tired of not being able to stop. Who was I before? How did I experience life? Time? Joy and sorrow? 


So wish me luck. I know this is a journey. But I have been inspired by many of you and I am remembering that it is possible...I can be sober.",3

I have multiple addictions, to unhealthy food, to porn (which I have stopped but it's still a problem in my brain for sure) and to weed. Weed is a big source I feel. Smoking it makes me more vulnerable to my bad conditioned habits and patterns of living. 

I'm struggling getting off of it, currently i can't help that it's in the same home as me since I am in a apartment connected to someone's house and am taking care of a quadriplegic for our rent and they grow alot of weed and let us smoke at free will. 

 So basically I'm desperately asking for just a simple accountability buddy that will help keep me in check and just talk, whether you need someone to talk to as well I'm great at discussion it's fun, or if you just feel the need to help a fellow brother in need.

I have an addiction that I can't curb. The longest spells of sobriety were two separate six month streaks, but it just got worse every time I went back to it. I'm functional, maintain a steady career, and am in a healthy relationship, but other than that feel lethargic and unproductive. I know I could give more in both my relationship and my job and am held back by this stupid drug.  I've been in a haze for ten years and haven't done myself (or my depression and anxiety) any favors. I'm worried about what I've done to my brain and the habits in general that have formed. It feels pathetic to be addicted to this since I'll be thirty in the next two years and its often minimized as something that people can't get addicted to. I have gone through physical withdrawals for three days both times and have become reliant on it for an appetite, usually it takes three weeks to get back to a sense of normal eating. I hate the boredom of sobriety. My addiction comes out in other ways then, increased drinking and shopping. I'm just exhausted. I'm in therapy and my fiancé is supportive, but I just feel…empty. And feeling like I won't feel normal again. Just posting for advice and support I guess.",3

Then I had a craving late at night after the stores were closed and fished the container out of the bottom of my garbage can on the curbside. We're talking outdoors in full view of neighboring houses  shoulder-deep in a can full of kitchen garbage at 11pm.

 I'm a grownup with a good job and it's not like I couldn't just buy more at the store the next day. I think the idea of ""giving it up"" triggered some worse cravings. I was pretty surprised as I considered myself casual but pushing the envelope of a use disorder (limited to evenings, but increasingly most of them and about an 8th a week on a heavy week) before that. If I honestly lokked at the DSM IV substance use disorder criteria I was working my way from moderate towards severe.

I made sure to share this super-embarrassing story with my wife so she can hold me accountable and installed a quit-tracker on my phone. Anyway, I had that last smoke that I fished through the garbage for (pretty lackluster tbh) then scattered the rest back into the trash and haven't touched it since. Solid 2 weeks and counting.

What I learned from that relapse is that this habit could kill me.. I know you're thinking ""Weed doesn't kill anyone"" allow me to elaborate.I have been a CHRONIC smoker for more than half of my life, and awhile ago I began to notice some chest pain and dark color mucus (TMI i know), that was shortly followed by sharp chest pain and heat palpitations that wake me up out my sleep, gasping for air.

So to those thinking about quitting , I want you to know that there is so much that they do not tell you about smoking.. The fumes that you are inhaling (Lighter, Tobacco and residue) are not healthy for your lungs or respiratory system.

I know everyone is different so my experience can be different that yours, however I know that after 24 hours of no weed.. I see that this life of mine is far too valuable to waste on a substance that I abused to help numb a screwed up childhood.

The last time I attempted to stop smoking, I failed because I didn't keep myself busy and let the boredom take over. So everyday I VOW to make a post in the reddit\\leaves group for the next 21 days, updating everyone on my progress.

If it's that scary, then I gotta do it. I'm definitely mentally addicted. 
Weed is tricky because it's so safe. With something like alcohol, the next day I wake up feeling like shit, not being able to workout etc.. with weed, sometimes I have great workouts even while high and the next day I'm not affected (or atleast I think I'm not).
So it sneaks up on you.. bam, it's been five years and it's a part of my life now more than I'd ever thought it would be.

Yet I am afraid to. I am trying to not go and to stop justifying to myself that i can do that because I know that I have tried that before and every time I have failed. What would be different this time? Probably nothing. 

The issue for me is never getting high. I love to be high! Especially after a long T-break. The issue for me though is the eating and the poor prioritization that comes with being high. I just wish I could have the occasional edible and still be a workout warrior and motivated to eat healthy and track my diet. 

I've been down this road before and I am really trying to not break. I have killed it the past 11 days and even if I do break, it doesn't take that success away but I would feel like I am losing my will power and giving in to my weak addicted mind. FUUUUUUUCK!",2

I am currently on month 3 and almost approaching month 4.  I know it sounds like a big deal, it did to me at one point too. But lately I am just so goddamn miserable  and angry and sad ... That all I want is to smoke. I don't care for my progress sometimes, other times I remind myself I don't want to throw it all away. I also remind myself of my goals and why I quit (mental health, career). But lately , that is just not cutting it. 

I have developed other hobbies since I quit. Also, I attend therapy  and take medication for my mental health but I cannot - for the LIFE OF ME - shake off this  aggravating yearning to smoke that I have been experiencing as off the last few weeks.  I guess that speaks to addiction...? I thought after 3 months  I would have no problem with this... But stressful events began happening in my life and i am REALLY starting to crack. Like I'm on the verge and only seconds away from smoking. I'm loosing my mind trying not to. I don't know what to do. I'm almost feeling like resorting to self harm to take the edge off. If I had a joint in front of me right now I wouldn't even think twice to smoke it. I wonder if this post expresses the intense battle in my head right now and all the self control i am trying to muster..sometimes I think there is not even anything wrong with smoking but then I'm like who am I kidding? I have experienced a huge positive difference in my potential since I have stopped.. In terms of anxiety, depression, energy, memory.. everything. 

I don't know why I posted this, I feel like my mind is made that I want/need to do it ... But a small part of me..
 like 2% of me ... Is telling me to stay away and not worsten my mental health.  I haven't once felt the relaxation I feel when I smoke since I have stopped. I don't know what to do with this void. 

I am also not even like those people who will say I only want to do it ""one more time"". I know damn well, the next Or maybe the next next day, I will realize how shitty being sober is and chase after marijuana high yet again, like a hamster who cannot get off his wheel...",3

Hey everyone. I'm kinda making this post for myself to get it out, but comments are definitely appreciated. 

The last time I smoked was around 4am on Monday 20th Jan 2020. For maybe a month before then I had seriously cut down - usually only having a couple little bowls a day. I'd been wanting to cut down for a while and had tried to quit a couple times before with no luck. 

The sad/funny thing is that yes I wanted to cut down/quit for a while, but never did because 1. It was hard 2. It was still fun 3. The withdrawal symptoms hit me like a brick wall. But then weed itself made me start feeling very bad.

Please let me know if anyone else has experienced this. When I smoked/got high it made my chest feel weird - like my heart was pounding like crazy, but when I took my pulse it wasn't that different to when sober and was within normal healthy parameters. It also made my breathing feel weird, like I was having to consciously make an effort to breathe. It's hard to describe exactly how I felt, but it was kinda like my body was experiencing physical anxiety symptoms, but mentally I felt fine. 

To be frank, that is the main reason I quit. It's taken me a while though. I was still smoking for weeks and having it make me feel bad EVERY damn day. Even though it made me feel bad I still craved it. Then for maybe a week I felt fine when smoking, but then it started making me feel bad again. So I slowly finished what I had, having less every day until I was out. I even considered buying more but I thought why am I even considering it?! It makes me feel shit so why bother. 

The only thing now is the withdrawal symptoms suck balls. My sleeping pattern is weird, I'm either staying up til 4am or dying at 10pm. I'm feeling foggy/confused/it's hard to concentrate. This one is really annoying cause I'm sober so I want a clear mind. I've been feeling nauseous quite a lot. But the worst of all is the headaches. They come and go but when they come, OH BOY. I have a headache now and it's like someone is drilling into my temples and like there's a weight on top of my head. Then of course the headaches make it very hard to think or focus. It's also effecting my eyes, I assume that's part of the headaches. But sometimes it's like my eyeballs are aching and it's horrible. 

I'm glad to (hopefully) be free from weed making me feel shitty, but these headaches are driving me crazy. 

If you read all this then thank you I appreciate it :). I hope you all have a fantastic day!",4
2020-01-22 17:35:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/esjhp9/one_week_down/,One week down,"Okay so let me start off by saying I tried to quit over a year ago. I went a full two months and then I caved. But when I lost my job this past September I began smoking oil carts more and more. Getting to about a gram a week or so. Spending money I didn't have so after the new year I decided I needed to stop. A week ago I finished my last cart and at the same time my battery started having issues so win win I threw everything away and told myself if I really wanted to smoke it was going to cost more than normal. The first day after quitting I was miserable. The second day was my lady's mother's birthday so we spent the day there and I didn't really think about smoking until bedtime. Third day I came down with a bit of a fever and barely could leave my bed without feeling like death. Yesterday my fever broke and since all I can think about is buying again. But over the last week I was offered two different jobs, both good, but they drug test. So I had to decline knowing full well I would not pass. 

I have been smoking since I was 15. Like every day for the last 15 years. For 7 of those years I lived with my dealer so I smoked more than most people I know. My son is 3 now and I don't even have stoner friends anymore. I smoke by myself for absolutely nothing except that I tell myself it helps my anxiety but it doesn't. Those oil pens make it worse and with all the reports of bad carts I have a strange paranoia about getting sick from them. My state just made weed legal on the first, but the prices are outrageous and I'm not willing to buy them illegally anymore. My fiance doesn't like weed or smoking in the slightest so the worst part is I've been hiding it from her. She knows I smoke just not close to the extent I was. 

How do you get past this feeling of nothingness? How do you live without something that has been more reliable to me than my own friends? Why is quitting carts so much harder than flower? 

I joined Reddit to find this community to talk and help since there are no MA meetings anywhere near me. I need advice motivation and a place to vent.

I began meditating close to 10 years ago, daily practice for past 7 years.

When I took the 9 month break, I was meditating daily for around 30-45 min a day and after I quit, the withdrawals/cravings were very bad for 9 months.  I also kept planning to start again but wasn't sure when. I was working at a club 3 nights a week until 4am and practicing terrible sleep hygiene.

My daily practice is now 75 min in the morning and 20 min at night for approx the last 2 years, if I stop now (haven't for last 3 days) I'm hoping my more established/longer meditation practice could be helpful along with the I never want to go back vs the I'm going to go back eventually mindset. 

I know it wont be easy and i'll deal with a lot but I'm curious if all my meditation effort along with exercise(yoga), and good sleep hygiene could make it more bearable?,,,in the past when I quit for 3 months and 3 weeks, the acute/post withdrawal wasnt as bad as when i quit for 9 months and maybe my mindset and sleep hygiene were key contributors to the 9 months of misery? Any chance my meditation practice could help speed up the rewiring of my brain?

I've made a lot of realizations over the past few years bec of my meditation practice along with other things like how important circadian rhythm is, compassion, and just how everything is really connected. I listen to a ton of podcasts about meditation, neuroscience and consciousness and I'm really interested in the mind and mind/body connection.  I think for me to realize my overall potential in various areas, it has gotten to the point where I can't hide from the fact that weed (which has been so comforting at times) can no longer be with me. I sometimes think that a lot of my realizations and insights have been assisted by weed and the shift in consciousness it provides but objectively i know thats probably not the case and if anything the opposite is true. 

any thoughts or questions much appreciated, thank you",2

I smoked everything I had on Sunday (technically it was Monday since it was late) before bed and haven't smoked since.  Sleeping has been horrible and I haven't been interested in anything.  Playing guitar is the one thing that has been working for me and I'm glad I realized that.  I never smoked before/during work, but I would leave work every day with my gym bag and drive right by the gym and go home to pack a bong and get zooted instead.  I would get high and eat more, and also got lazy as a result.  

Since Sunday, I've noticed I have a lot of energy, maybe its nervousness or anxiety, but I feel livelier.  My hands have been sweating like a bitch and that's super annoying.  It's hard when I think about the 7 hours I have between the time I get home and when I go to bed and how to fill that amount of time without smokin.  I've noticed my mind racing lately, it's kind of worrying since I don't know when it'll stop - this is mostly at night in bed.

I drink an average amount (never alone) but I like to go out with friends and drink.  I think this would be a great way to smoke but I don't know if I have the self control.

I've found that every single time I relapse is over vacations.

This might seem healthy that I only smoke when it doesn't interfere with school and the like, but it isn't. The result is that I binge smoke my entire Thanksgiving break, Christmas break, etc. I just isolate in my room, get high as a kite, eat like shit, you might know what I mean. I'm totally out of it the entire week. I don't really have fun either. I end up making zero plans and just watch bad TV.

The worst part is when the week ends. I have to go back to school and ultimately decide to sober up. Now, instead of going back refreshed, I go back feeling like shit-- a mix of withdrawals and the fact that my sober self didn't get a vacation. My 'sober self' feels like he has just been risen from the dead after a week!

Anyways, I've been sober for almost a month and I really want to keep it going. But midterms are insanely stressful and I am terrified about how I'll feel when they're over; no tests, new semester, no big responsibilities. And February break isn't far away.

I honestly, honestly thought it was the best thing ever for my depression, from which I've suffered for decades (yup - I started smoking at 42, a supposed grown-up). 

About nine months in I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I''ve had my ups, but I've never recognized them as bipolar hypomania. but after about two months of daily use my first-ever full-blown mania episode started. I didn't know what it was, I just thought cannabis was *really* working - mania feels like a high on its own, let alone when you're smoking on top of it 

But here's the thing: when I found myself in a psychiatrist's office after I came crashing down 9 months later, and got the diagnosis, I didn't quit. The doctor told me that my prognosis would be worse if I continued to smoke, and I *did not quit*. Six months later I experienced another manic episode, which was even worse than the first (almost left my husband, almost lost my job, spent thousands of euros). And now I'm in a midst of the worst depressive episode I've ever had. I""m on a sick-leave, and really worried that I'll be permanently disabled.

I don't think weed caused my bipolar, but I'm convinced it did cause the escalation from mild-ish form with productive hypomanias to actual mania. If I continue, what's next? Cannabis-induced psychosis?

I have been smoking since around 15-16yo. I am now 34 and have been smoking everyday for the last 16 years. The longest I have had off it in those years is 7 days whilst on holiday which was horrific for all involved. 

I also have a long history of depression which I have used weed as a crutch to maintain as normal a life as possible. My depression come with  bouts of sucidal ideation which are intensified when trying to stop smoking. 

Married with an 18 month old and everytime I look at them I feel overwhelmed with guilt as I am blowing so much money on green. I had planned to quit prior to the wee one being born but only managed a few days off it here and there before relapsing. 

I need to give up for my child and my own physical and mental health. I am struggling to find the head space to get motivated to quit but the internal turmoil  and guilt are at the point of being unbarable. 

Sure many others have been here before. 

I am currently preparing myself to try again and chuck it for good. Any advice to fill and pass the time during the worst of the withdrawal.

I personally used it for a decade, abused it for five years.

I'm realizing now that my brain doesn't know what life is without cannabis. It's severely deluded. It drives me to pursue idiotic behavior like staying up until 4am watching TV for 12 hours, drinking ridiculous amounts of caffeine, and wasting my time obsessively reading about stuff on the internet. Staying distracted. And none of it is satisfying in the least. The addiction isn't just the cannabis, it's a deep, entrenched way of operating.

My brain is even trying to convince me that the first days of withdrawal are the best, since they seem the most painful and tangible, at the surface. The pain now is subtle, insidious, almost like it's not there, but it's deep in the unconscious, stirring, and I hate it.

In the beginning, I knew I had to try hard to recover, so I surrendered to practicing yoga and meditation, eating well, being mindful, talking to family, walking.

But now, my body feels better, I can think more clearly, and yet, my mind still wants to convince me that the previous way of operating is the best way. *It's trying to push me back down into a hole.*

The grooves created by addiction and cannabis abuse run very deep into the subconscious and unconscious parts of us. We need to persevere and have so much patience and gratitude to adjust. But what to do when the motivation isn't there any more? It's strong at the beginning when things seem so terrible.

The only reason I can even see any of this happening is because my mind isn't clouded by the delusions of a chemical high. Is this what life feels like to those who don't abuse drugs?

Patience, Breath in. Pause. Breath out. Pause. But wow, does this suck. Breath in. Pause. Breath out. Pause. It's no longer a waiting game. Breath in. Pause. Breath out. Pause.

This simplistic, reductionist understanding of addiction breeds stupid drug combatant slogans such as 'just say no', when we all know addiction extends far beyond just saying no.  


The longer I struggle, and gradually get more comfortable on sober days, the more I come to realize that the physical component of addiction pales in comparison to the mental aspect. I've come to believe that about 20% of my addiction stems from chemical, or physiological needs to use. The 80% that drives me is the mental aspect of addiction. The lack of alternative healthy coping strategies. The lack of support networks. Breaking the paradigm I have created of how I view myself, for I am not simply a stoner or a drug addict. That is not my story. I seek to increasing self-discipline, to not be controlled by bodily urges. I am stronger than the desires of my addiction. The desire to shape me into who I know I can become is greater than the desires that have held be back thus long.

Just for today, I am strong.",6

It’s been ten days, but last night I had some revelations and my willpower stood up. My friend came by and we were gonna work out etc. He got a new machine that makes weed cookies or something, so he brought 8 totalling like 400mg. I was like buddy I’m not eating one, why don’t you just pretend I did. He then eats them all at once. An hour later he’s talking about how fucked he is etc and it does not look fun at all. 

Afterwards I walk him to the rapid transit station at like midnight, and he mentions “man without those cookies I would have needed to smoke by at least 8oclock, but I didn’t have to!’. as if it was some amazing money saving tip somehow. I thought “why do you have to?’. I guess I’m already forgetting about the compulsion, it just reminded me of when I used to smoke cigarettes and I was glad I “didn’t have to” at 8 either and I didn’t even need cookies.

We waited a while so he just lights a joint and is all “don’t you love the smell?’ I explain I never did, if I’m smoking I don’t notice it, and if I’m not it’s like cigarette smoke if you’re not smoking. Just an annoying smell. He kept forgetting and offering it to me and I turned it down every time.

On the way back home I noticed I didn’t have to stop by a convenience store to buy a few random drinks and snacks. When I was high that would have been essential, or I’d get home and be mad I didn’t.

I don’t miss it. I feel awful, but I’m seeing how it’s better. I could get high and feel awful while spending much more money. Cheaper to just feel awful lol. I know it will get better.

^("" In a prospective study of 1037 people from birth to age 38,41 persistent cannabis exposure (assessed at ages 18, 21, 26, 32 and 38 years) was associated with significant decline in neuropsychological performance. Of note,) **^(these cognitive impairments did not show significant improvement following reduction of use or complete abstinence (>1 year cessation in some cases).)** ^(In the context of our data, these findings suggest that functional deficits may persist in abstinent former users, despite apparent recovery of hippocampal integrity."") 

You can view the study [HERE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068875/).

It's been 16 days and my lack of motvation (despite being way better) and low attention span have not completly recovered. I'm scared it never will :/

Hi, I am an addict. I was an addict of food as soon as I realized the reality of my broken family at age 7. From there I chose alcohol at 15 as well as sex, and then mj at 19.  My drug of choice is marijuana but my mind doesn't know how to stop so  more more more is my problem. 
I am alcohol free as of 6-15-17, but went back to person places and lifestyle for my bff Mary Jane. Now today, 2 years later, I am breaking up with her. She is my bff and I miss her so much. I realized she doesn't miss me and doesn't have my best interest in mind. 
My first time I quit I replaced mj with alcohol. Second time I quit, it was cause I voluntarily accepted a court order crtc treatment center, after a traffic stop,wide turn at a left turn. Car was searched and they found 5 grams and boom arrested. I couldn't keep up the paranoid visits to my Probation officer, wondering if the detox pee clean stuff would work. I admitted to her after my 2nd UA, I needed help. I Thank my HP for the timing, though the circumstances sucked.   I learned cognitive behavioral therapy practises and transitioned successfully from there in the 6 months. But I knew then I wasn't quitting pot, so I went back after 8 months clean. My counselor there said the process doesn't stop just cause I am out of treatment and it can take my attempts and years.  I am fairly sure I suffer from OCD but I am getting off all mind altering substances including caffeine, before I go to an OCD counselor. Addict brain can be tricky. I want to go to the therapist and say yes, I am substance free. 
Happy Hi How are you Day! Thanks to this app, my HP and me for allowing this conversation to be so easy and real.
I open this app at least 10 times a day to remind myself how much $$ and grams I would have bought and smoked, holy smokes!

I would say quitting cannabis is an ultimate test in patience.  Not only do usual rules for stopping addiction apply, but the symptoms while milder than say alcohol or heroin, will be with you for quite some time.

- 30-90 days before you can pass a drug test for employment

- 30 days - 6 months of withdrawal, depending on how long and how much you smoked

- Most people quit when they are at a low point in their life and the withdrawal can make it seem so much harder to deal with

- The fact you no longer have anything in common with your stoner friends and people who don't smoke judge you for having fallen to the devil's lettuce in the first place

Weed has been a big part of my life since 8th grade. I am currently a senior finishing my last semester in college and can probably count on one hand how many days I haven’t smoked since the end of middle school. Recently, I’ve noticed marijuana makes me anxious, makes my heart race, that I’m lazy and can’t stop eating. I just accepted my dream job as an Investment Analyst in a hedge fund following my graduation in May, so this felt like the time to quit all together. I haven’t smoked in about 8 days now. I feel great. I eat a normal amount of food and have the motivation to workout more. I am clear-headed and overall tackle the day with more enthusiasm. I’ve felt so good that I don’t even really had an urge to smoke. The one thing that has been screwed up since I stopped is my sleep. I have no trouble going to sleep (I take a bit of melatonin and nod off). I have trouble staying asleep because my dreams are so intense. For the first few days, it felt really nice dreaming again. I haven’t had many dreams since I started smoking. Now, they are a nuisance. My dreams are so intense that I wake up once every 30 minutes to an hour. I have no trouble going back to sleep after I wake up, but once I do my dreams rush back in and the cycle repeats. The past few days I’ve been having the most vividly horrible nightmares. I’ve noticed I’m tired in class, which is making it hard to focus. I took a nap for the first time in years. Usually I would never nap because I would get a ton of sleep at night. Has anyone else had this side effect? If so, how long does it take for your sleep to get back to normal? The past few nights, I’ve wanted to smoke before bed just to stop the dreams and get a good night sleep. This is the one downside since I’ve stopped smoking.",5

Weed on itself is a big problem and coupled with Vyvanse its becomes more of a problem.

 

The medication makes me anxious and irritated and to relieve the symptoms i would smoke. It gives me a tiny bit of relief but then i get anxious that i smoked and im around family.

I know it’s only the start, but it’s a start. Feeling clear headed and not spending half my day wanting weed and the other half high has been a revelation.

My biggest problem was when I finished work. My routine would be finish work at 11pm, be home for around midnight and immediately roll a joint and chill till about 3am. I found myself pacing my living room, smoking more cigarettes and eating way more than I normally would to stop me calling someone to drop a 20 bag (that last one is probably a good thing, I'm a skinny fucker and need to put on weight).

2020-01-22 01:28:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/es82wf/reflections_after_100_days/,Reflections after 100+ days,"So today is 103 days clean from cannabis. It’s been quite a journey to this point

I remember starting after a 7+ year run of smoking every day. It was awful. The two weeks for me were consumed with headaches and stomach aches. I could barely hold down any food. It was tough... However, I eventually powered through.

Some things I’ve noticed - good and bad

* I have a much higher desire to do things now. I’m no longer satisfied with just sitting at home playing games. I have been studying for technical exams and am planning to go back to school to continue my education instead.

* My diet has gone back to normal. I’ve put on about 20ish pounds since I’ve stopped. When I was smoking I would barely eat unless I was high. Now I’d say I eat too much sometimes. With that being said, I need to get much more disciplined on going to the gym.

* I am much more outgoing compared to before. I don’t worry about being high and acting weird around people. I have more fun talking to and learning about people. I have started a juggling club at work, made several new friends and even got a promotion at work as a result of this.

* I have vivid dreams and can recall them much better. This has its ups and downs as nightmares are much more vivid.

* My memory is much better. I feel like I can remember things much better. When I was getting high id sometimes forget what I was talking about mid sentence. I now never run into stuff like that. 

* I started journaling my life and going to therapy. Taking care of mental health is important

* I have more $$$ at the end of the month since I’m not having to buy multiple zips of weed to support my habit.

* I using alcohol much more often. It’s not an issue by any means. More of an occasional weekend drink and in social situations, however I rarely/if ever drank when I was smoking weed. This is something I need to monitor though as I could see how it’s easy to spiral out of control with that. My advice to someone starting is not to swap one for another and to be careful about that as it’s easy to do.

* I find myself not as emotionally inhibited. This is for the most part a good thing, but with that, when I get irritated I am not as complacent when it comes to expressing it. I also realized I have some pent-up anger that weed masked. Certain things trigger that and I am still working on these things.

I am sure there are more but that’s a good start. 

So with all that being said, it’s been a great journey and I’m super proud of myself. 100ish days ago, I didn’t thing this was possible. I’m still human though. It’s not all sunshine and roses. I wanted to write this in a way that puts the positives and negatives in perspective. I’m still on a journey and still have things to work on, but overall I’d say it’s been a major improvement for me. 

Understand that the first few weeks are no doubt the hardest. After that, I’d say things are much more manageable. My fiancée still smokes every day but I don’t have an urge to partake anymore. I can still be around people who do, but I know why I am doing this and I stick to it.

Do it for you, write down why your doing it, and refer back to that as needed. I have my reasons but it’s different for everyone.

For those of you just starting, it’s totally doable. Stay committed, remember why your doing it and know the temporary hurdles are temporary. I was there not too long ago and thought it was impossible, but you CAN prove yourself wrong. 

TLDR; Quit weed 103 day’s ago and things in my life have change dramatically in a mostly positive way. Don’t give up!

The first time I was dankrupt and broke and went about a month. I felt good so when I had some spare cash I didn’t fill up right away. But then hanging with friends... and you know. 

The second time I was trying to show support for my alcoholic husband and his attempts at sobriety. I quit for three months to the day. I got the stash back out when I came home after a double shift, dinner in hand, to find him passed out drunk in bed.  I got super fucked up and ate an entire medium pizza alone. I’m a spiteful bitch sometimes. I later learned he never stopped drinking for even a day. 

The third time was after two years of very heavy use. I was loosing who I was as a person to this heavily stoned, immobile zombie. My room was filthy by my standards because I was too lit to clean or perform basic functions like laundry and decluttering or dishes. I couldn’t really tell you what tv I watched last week. I was in a Terrible living situation and used basically all the time just to numb the rage. My finances were spiraling, and I made the choice to be better. Drying out that time absolutely sucked. I had real withdrawal. I stayed clean for only six weeks. But I’ve never gone back up to using like during those two years. 

I smoke to numb the rage. I smoke the numb the fear. I smoke so I can Smile. So I can laugh. So I’m not panicking about my husbands most recent bender and how I’m drowning in debt as he pours every dollar he can down his throat. I can barely eat I’m so anxious and nauseous with rage and worry and fear every day. Smoking takes it all away. 

My alcoholic husband has been on a month long bender. He supplements with smoking. I got rid of All of it. There is nothing left. I’m three days clean and here I am, wide awake after Another emotional tornado of a night wishing I could smoke so I could sleep. I think my biggest problem is I don’t know how to function without it ‘taking the edge off’.",4

I would feel ashamed that I wasn’t in control of MY OWN SELF.

I would feel embarrassed by my (perceived) weak nature.

I would feel shock and anger that I couldn’t just snap out of it!!!!!!

I would feel overwhelmed by the realization that this drug had control over me. 

I felt stuck on a hamster wheel. 

I felt a lack of trust in myself. It tanked my self-esteem massively because I would constantly say/think one thing and then do another. 

I’ve been clean for going on 10 months, and the last time I relapsed, I said these things to my therapist. It wasn’t that I just got high another day, it was that I truly felt that I had betrayed myself once again. Long after the relapse high wore off, I felt fucking pitiful. Like I didn’t have the strength to do what I KNEW was best for me. What I KNEW I wanted so bad but couldn’t give to myself.

Expressing the feelings I had around relapse has helped me stick to my sobriety this time. No cravings, no desire, no temptation to go back. I don’t want to ever feel that way about myself again. 

If you have had trouble relapsing before or feel tempted now, I encourage you to really tap into how you feel the day, even hour after that hit. You betrayed yourself again. Don’t give in.",7

When I first started smoking it was AMAZING. I was such a vibrant, crazy, fun and ambitious individual that barely had a care in the world. Weed for me was an escape to hilarious laughs with my pals, entertainment when I was bored and a distraction from boyfriends/life problems.

Skip forward over 4 years later and it consumes my life. I don't feel like myself anymore. I feel anxious now and I feel like I have no motivation. When I smoke all I think about is wanting to quit and when i'm not high all i think about is wanting to smoke. My friends only smoke on occasion when we are all having a girls night or going to the movies or something but here I am smoking away for any occasion.

I want to stop but its a never ending battle in my head and I want to be done for good. Sometimes I feel sad coming to the realization that I cant occasionally smoke and If I stop smoking then i'm quitting forever and that scares me...

Im not someone who needs to smoke the second they wake up but the second I get home from work or school its the only thing I think about. 

My biggest reason for wanting to stop is the distance I have caused between my family and I. If i dont smoke I get very irritable and it makes me not want to be around my family but then i cant  be around my family high.....aka the never ending battle

I dont wanna make myself seems all high and mighty, I'm just saying that it may not seem like there is a problem because everything is going well and have control over everything, except getting high. And that's what I think, has been keeping me from going the extra mile.

So I never really thought that smoking was a problem for me, even tho I smoked everyday for 3 years and was probably high 75% of the day. Idk when I started wondering that I had a problem. I think it was when I would have to smoke before ever car ride to make it fun and amusing, because without it, it felt dull. Reality has become dull. And I hate to know I'm relying on something to make life more exciting. 

I'm in a very good place in my life. I have a good job, l live with my parents while I'm in school full time, I have a great social life and a pretty good love life. My mental health is also strong. This made it harder to realize there was a problem because, I thought ""as long as I keep my shit together, I can be faded as much as I want"".

I kept my shit together....barely. I'm a very motivated person, generally. To many it may seem like I am working hard and getting my shit done, and I am, but not to my best capability, that I know I probably could be. Everything is being done at the bare minimum. Yeah I got an 90% in the class but that was with minimal work, that I knew I needed to do, to at least get an A. But it doesnt feel like I was truly giving it my 100%. It makes me wonder ""if I'm already good, how much better could I be if I did put in 100%""? 

I want to see how much better of a headspace I can be in sober. Weed has been with me for 3 years non stop. I've learned to love myself in that time, not because of the weed but because of my experiences and now that I've grown more, I wanna see how much further I can go without it, even if it maybe difficult.

My life is peaking right now, and it seems a though there is nothing to fix because everything is going so well.  I could probably continue to smoke and still do what I have to do and that sounds comforting, but I wanna get out of my comfort zone before i get worst that I already am and see how good reality can be without that little boost. How much more can I accomplish, if I regain control over that part of me that always wants to be high?

I've started with cutting back, rather than going cold Turkey. I smoked my last bit of weed 7 days ago, I still have smoked everyday but only once a day with my best friend, who has agreed to help me slowly stop. I smoke with her and then we chill and I go home. She also kept my pipe, to keep me from going to buy weed, cause I'd have nothing to smoke it out of.

It's a start because I would smoke every chance I got, which lead to me being high all day. Its day 7 and I feel the withdrawal symptoms. The first few days, the cravings were very hard but today I dont crave it as much. I haven't been able to sleep right in the past 2 days, tossing and turning all night, I feel a little irritated with everyone and food hasn't been as appetizing but it'll pass. I hope this leads to me eventually stopping for good.

TLDR: 7th day cutting back to eventually quit, because I want to be a better version of myself and give my 100%

I've experienced at least 10 nightmares, cried countless amounts of times and honestly wanted to just crawl out of my own skin. I'm finding now that the sweats have died down massively, however my mood goes up and down in waves. I spend 80% of the day worrying/anxious, with moments here and there where I feel fine.

Been working out 5 days a week (which I was doing when smoking anyway) and eating MUCH healthier, so they're some positives to pull from it. I do feel healthier physically, but mentally I honestly feel worse. I've not once craved getting high, even when smelling it going to and from the gym, but I think that's because the anxiety is too overwhelming to comprehend anything else.

I've no plans on going back to the green and do believe I'm off it for good; but once this anxiety and impending feeling of ""doom"" dissipate I'll consider it a job well done.

Best of luck to everyone else going through it. 2020 is YOUR year and it's only just begun. Love to you all!",5

I was a huge stoner, I have a very fortunate work at home job/position where I can buy unlimited amount of wax, flower, fun pieces. Obviously every stoner's dream but it comes with a price. Before I quit, I was smoking atleast 3 dabs before BREAKFAST. I shouldn't even use the term Breakfast because I was smoking so much I didn't need to eat much in the day.. Then 3 hours later, more dabs, maybe a small break from 4-7PM but then once the night hits I was just making myself a zombie. Weed was making me extremely depressed and anxious and I made the bold decision in my brain that this is it. No more weed. No 12 hour relapse, or 3 day relapse, this is it.

For the first few days it seemed like I was high on life, but this was purely just the pink cloud over my brain telling me this will be easy. By day 4 I was hit with some of the worst anxiety I have ever had, I couldn't even be in my skin and I wanted to numb this so bad. Horrible depression, fears I haven't had in months come back. But I stuck with it.

The #1 advice I can give is being aware of your thoughts, be aware your natural reaction is to want to smoke, be aware you know the consequences, be aware you have to GO THROUGH DISCOMFORT TO REACH ULTIMATE HAPPINESS. Don't let your brain trick you and think 1 hit will be fine because if you're like me, you know you don't have control, and you NEED to get that in your head before anything. I didn't even start feeling OKAY until end of Day 8, but these last 3 days I have seen some light I haven't seen in years. Im eating great again, sleeping OK/good again (this one takes time haha)

Don't do it for anybody else by the way, do it for yourself. You can change today.

Hello everyone, I think the title is pretty self explanatory but I really need some of your advice on this.  


I used to smoke everyday untill I totally disconnected with reality and I started failing my classes, loosing friends and overall feeling like wasting my early 20s. Weed isn't addictive for everyone but it sure af was for me, I was a literal junkie. If I was addicted to any other drug than weed i probably would be dead by overdosing.  


I finally was able to stop smoking 3 years ago and now Im doing pretty well in my first year of masters, even managed to hold a job as a student assistant, I got in good shape working out and feeling pretty optimistic about life instead of having the constant weed brain fog all day and feeling anxious and paranoid about everything.  


I don't ever want to smoke and waste my life again but Im going to Amsterdam this weekend with friends (They know I don't smoke anymore and wont force me or anything but they are still going to visit a coffeshop).  


So should I go with them and get a little high with the weed in the air or just travel by myself while they are smoking and join with them later ?  


I have 0 interest in smoking tbh and feel like I can handle ""1 time high in 3 years"" but  that might just be the addicted part of my brain trying to trick me, I don't trust myself after how insanly addicted I was.  


Sorry for rambling out, but what do you suggest I do ? I think I already know the answer but still would appreciate your input.",4

Two years ago I was living with my parents, working dead end minimum wage jobs, and saving no money at all. I was failing college, unhealthy, and completely unmotivated. Weed was legitimately the biggest barrier in my life. 


As soon as I quit I finally gained courage and motivation/drive to achieve things. Now I’m in a career I absolutely love, making more money than I even know how to spend, and living on my own with plenty of savings and am in the market about to buy a house by myself. Also, two years ago my main and only hobby was smoking. 

Now I’ve developed an intense passion for music, and am well on my way to learning guitar and piano. I’ve also really seriously fallen in love with fitness, primarily running and weightlifting and I’ve progressed much farther than I would’ve ever imagined I could. 

I could go on, and on about the improvements in life, but most important is that I have a constant level of peace in my heart and I really very very rarely go through bad times anymore. I’m not irritable, and I gain much enjoyment doing things I could have never imagined would’ve given me enjoyment. 

I’ve really fallen in love with life and my mind is immeasurably quicker and sharper. Every day I have an abundance of energy that allows me to very quickly move towards my goals. I know with 110% certainty that weed was my greatest inhibitor because everything started changing right when I freed myself from its grip.",310
2020-01-21 05:34:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/erstt3/day_11_of_quitting_and_i_feel_like_ive_started_a/,Day 11 of quitting and I feel like I've started a new life,"This is my first post on Reddit.

For about 10 years I smoked every day, all day.  When I woke up/before work, when I got home from work, before the gym, after the gym, before sleep, and before/after any event or gathering I would have to show up to.  I have a good job and am in really good physical shape, but I barely had any friends and would just stay home and play video games on the weekends.

As I watched all my friends on social media going out and enjoying their lives, seeing the world, I decided that enough was enough.  I was done being boring and not having a personality, done being stuck in my apartment all the time, done having difficulty talking to people or looking them in the eye because I was so high and out of it.

I decided to take a vacation to southeast Asia to start my journey to find my old self again (if I even knew what that was at that point).  I traveled solo and told myself that I would not touch weed once on this trip.  It ended up being the best vacation of my life.  I met so many amazing people that I was able share amazing experiences with, I cant remember the last time I've ever been able to do that.  I was so lonely for so long.  Upon reflection, I realized that if I had continued my weed smoking habits there, I would have missed out on so much.  I know I wouldn't have met any of these people, and even if I had, I would have come off as boring and uninteresting.

It's such a weird feeling.  It's only now that I'm 11 days off weed that I realize my brain was only operating at 50-75% of its capability.  Things are so much sharper now.  I used to hate being around people, now I cant get enough it.  Only 11 days in, and I actually have friends now who want to hang out with me.  I feel like an entirely different person, almost like I've been re-born in a way; experiencing a new life.  It's pretty overwhelming (in a good way).

I've experienced everything weed has to offer.  It's time for me to move on and experience what unadultered life has to offer and truly connect with other people.  It makes me sad that I've wasted so much of the time given to me on this planet, but I'm determined to make the most of the rest of it.

Thank you to this community and everyone for sharing their stories, as they really have helped me make some realizations and gather the motivation to make such a big change to my life.  I'm done with weed, it's time to demand the best of myself and this life right now.",53

Initially, I thought there was fk all cause it sucks all the time and I still feel like I have withdrawals, but I did some thinking and here's what I came up with.

Thank you for getting me to consider this - i still struggle with cravings and fantasizing so this was a good exercise:

1. Energy - main negative for me was i was burnt out every morning
2. Healthier coping mechanisms - i was trying to dumb myself down to slow my mind down and calm anxiety but it was never effective. Need to be appreciative of the mind I have and not equate that with the need to be perfect and meet impossible expectations that ppl dont actually have of me that I created for myself as validation.
3. Motivation - my thoughts are more clear and I'm able to set goals and work towards them better.
4. Sharper mind - less distracted/hazy so I can focus better. Memory starting to come back - I usually have a very good memory but I had noticed it wasn't as apparent. Allows me to do be better at work.
5. Starting to feel like myself more - rather than avoiding pain and boredom I am discovering interests that I wasn't pursuing because my default was to get high at the end of each day and it was all I lived and looked forward to.
6. Vivid dreams - I'm a very imaginative person and my dreams were always so intriguing to me and I got those back (got over the nightmare phase after a few weeks).

Tldr weed exacerbated anything negative I ever considered and dwelled upon rather than addressing it and caused me to just freeze time and miss out on living my life. I have a much better relationship with myself since starting my recovery. 

Recovery is hard but it's WORTH IT. You owe it to yourself to fight. I still feel hopeless sometimes and like I can't do it but here I am today still sober - if I can do it so can you.

I can likely continue so let me know if you think there's anything else I can touch on :) wish you the best.

I'll update this if I come up with anything else.",3

So I’ve heavily cut down on weed, Lately I’ve only been smoking on the weekends which is good for me. I thought it’s fine no big deal.
I’ve started to notice the overthinking/irrational feelings again which now i realise, happened way too much when I was smoking heavily. I can really see how weed can affect relationships and work life etc. 

Also I’ve noticed that after a weekend of smoking, my work performance in the week starts of slow, then gets better as the thc gets out of my system. It really does have an effect on everything, especially if you’re a daily smoker.

It might just be ‘only weed’ but it still negatively impacts your mental health way more than you think it does. This is why I’m cutting it out completely. 

I urge you to just try 30 days without weed. Make the decision today that enough is enough and it’s time to cut weed out for good. Feel the difference in your mental health, your productivity, your relationships.

I'm 34, it's my birthday in 2 days, and I'm really struggling to come to terms with what I know I need to do at this point.

I've been smoking heavily since I was about 15. I've never really come to a conclusion as to why I smoked so heavily - other than just enjoying being stoned. A lot of my family smoke regularly, so it was introduced to me fairly early on.

Currently, I'm at a point in life where I'm slightly depressed, and having some pretty crazy anxiety day to day. Part of it is because I've let my ""habits"" go on for so long, knowing in the back of my mind I wanted to stop, and now I've put myself into a really bad financial position. I met a guy recently, and we've started a really great relationship which is 4 months in, however he is also quite a heavy smoker. He doesn't have any intention to quit at this point, but he understands my situation and will keep it away from me if necessary.

Regarding green, I've reached a point where I can't do it anymore. My thoughts are completely consumed by ensuring I have some every day, where I'm going to get it, how I'm going to afford it, etc.  which I can't even afford anymore. I've put myself into such financial burden, so I'm constantly chasing the next lot just to smoke, and forget about the horrible situation I'm in, therefore pushing it further and further into the beyond. 

I've also found that I've lost interest in a lot of things I was doing in the past, (especially things I would ""need weed"" to partake in) so, I really want to just clear my mind of that preconception that I need to smoke before doing something fun.

I've tried to stop a couple of times in the past, but I've never really sat and realised that it needs to stop for good. I think I go on autopilot and my brain keeps telling me that the only solution to feeling ok atm is to get more green. I need to stop, so that I can catch up financially, and mentally, and think about what I want to do with myself.

This has been part of my life for so long, and has helped me through so many good times, and all I can feel is sadness/anxiety/fear when I accept that I need to (and want to) stop right now.

I can't actually afford to get any more this week, so I think I just need to stop now and go through the wars. I wasn't sure if I should taper off, or just quit cold turkey - as either way seems hugely difficult.

Is there any advice anyone can give regarding things I can do to help me through this process? Has anyone quit cold turkey after 20 years? I have been so consumed by the fact that I have to stop, that I haven't even been able to formulate plans for doing it. I'd really appreciate any suggestions!!",3

I went and it went terribly.

It's been like sunshine for me in some pretty dark spots. And for years I wasn't able to get past day 4. Being brutally honest with myself changed that. 

I love how laid-back non-judgmental I become when I smoke, it really helped me escape a more uptight and judgmental upbringing. And I am grateful for the kind-hearted and open-minded lessons that weed taught me. I use them every day. But I wasn't able to quit until I decided to do the thing weed never made me do... **feel mad**. 

I took a step back and allowed myself to feel anger with a ""TV Character"" called myself. I started getting mad when this ""character"" would childishly say ""I can quit!"" NO, clearly they can't, I've been watching this show for 30+ seasons and they clearly can't quit. Or I'd see this character say ""I'm going to focus on the good things I want instead of weed! THAT will do it!"" NO, it won't. This show's main character is so unbearably naive. And poof, I had created a little loving and angry challenger. Finding the right balance of talking to myself like a loving encourager *and* a loving challenger has made all the difference. 

Since then I made it to Day 200+ in 2018, and Day 300+ in 2019 before falling right back in to daily use, and am currently Day 26 after going through a really hard fall, and relying on my ol' green crutches again. But I feel so different, the character of this show is really starting to get their life together. Finding real value in criticism and anger has given me another set of tools to go with the positive self-talk that I also desperately need. Anger isn't hate. And until I allowed myself to sit with my anger, I couldn't win. 

So what ratio of encourager-to-challenger do you need to finally win?

(I don't want to ask or challenge what the content of comments should ideally be, there's obviously no single answer to that. I'm wondering what ratio YOU need to succeed? )",3

2020-01-20 13:31:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/erhbtu/first_reddit_posttwo_weeks_clean/,First Reddit Post//TWO WEEKS CLEAN,"When I was first introduced to weed, I was super against it. I grew up in a sheltered home, and my step dad is a retired police officer. I knew it was labeled as “bad” and that’s how I saw it. After being around it for about a year, I decided I would try it. I was 19 years old, and at that point I would consider that I was a seldom smoker. I would smoke sometimes daily, and then take a break for a couple of day’s and start again. 

About 2-3 years ago, I was faced with my fear of rejection. That’s when I spiraled into smoking heavily everyday. I would smoke before class, before work, and at all points in the day. I believe that I somehow thought that would make me “cooler” or that it would ease the emotions that I was feeling. After about a year of smoking heavily, my uncle died. And within that year, I lost both of my grandfathers. That’s when it went completely downhill. I found myself leaning completely on weed, and I would smoke 2-4 bowls back to back just hoping to feel something. 

When I realized that I was depressed, I started trying to narrow down how it started. How I let it get out of control. I pointed to everything BESIDES weed. I would look at my old job, the fact that I moved away from family, and the loss that I experienced. While all of those were contributing factors, I suppressed my ability to deal with my depression by smoking my emotions out. 

Two weeks ago I faced what was holding me back from healing, and it was my relationship with weed. I stopped cold turkey. My fiancé and I both made the choice to live our lives sober, and I have felt the most clear headed and in control of my emotions. My depression is still here, but I’m now allowing myself to actually deal with it rather than making myself numb.

Got a bit too drunk the night before and the next day was quite hungover, ended up walking to a dispensary and picking up an oil pen. Oil pens just got legalized where I am (Canada) and I have been looking forward to smoking a safer pen since before I quit. 

I really thought I could fight the cravings, but being hungover + my addict brain telling myself lies really got to me. ""It won't be the same heavy high"", ""remember how productive you were when you vaped before studying"", ""you won't be able to quit properly until you try a legal pen at least once"" and other bullshit thoughts filled my head.

The high wasn't the same terrible, doom-inducing high I got from flower before quitting. But there was also NOTHING positive about the high at all. Anxiety was increased, was watching a TV show and didn't enjoy it more - just got more confused by the plot. 

The feeling of guilt in the evening was overwhelming and I had wished I'd done anything else except pot. 

The weed pen is sitting on my coffee table right now and even this morning I got a craving to have a puff and have ""a productive day"", but I know its all a lie. The pen is going in the trash right now and my new streak starts today.",4

The biggest reason I'm quitting is to find a job and because the plant is illegal and heavily stigmatized by the religious right in the US.  As a secular progressive, this is something that infuriates me but it's the society we live in.  It's infuriating that it's 2020 and a person is still essentially unemployable if they use cannabis.

Sometimes I feel like I want to smoke just to stick it to the conservative establishment that insists this plant is the ""devil's lettuce"" and that it ""destroys the moral fabric of society.""

I know this is my withdrawal speaking but I just needed to rant.  When I quit cigarette smoking I had similar anger towards the health nuts that successfully stigmatized that.  I found myself angry I didn't live back in the 1960s when everyone smoked cigarettes and it was considered a normal thing.  In the end, giving up cigarettes was one of the best things I ever did and I'm sure when this passes, I'll feel the same about weed.",3

I didn't smoke to help with any underlying issues, just purely for enjoyment but it took it's grip and here I am, 4 years later. I find my mind is racing constantly, telling me I'm a failure and stripping me of all self-confidence and motivation. I'm full of cold and presuming it's all part of the withdrawal phase.

How's everyone else doing that's not been smoking for 3 weeks or longer? When did you start to take it easier on yourself / feel happier? I've been feeling horrible, anxious and very restless. Managed to force a cry yesterday after playing some sad music to induce it, purely because I wasn't able to cry without it and I needed the release.

2020-01-20 08:46:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/erde7q/medical_or_malicious/,Medical or Malicious?,"I started smoking back in 2012 when I was 19 and started as a fairly infrequent smoker. As time went on I noticed ways that smoking seemed to help me calm down and eat regularly. Over the following years I was eventually diagnosed with an eating disorder, PTSD, and fibromyalgia. About two years ago I got a medical card and have smoked daily since then.

I feel conflicted now.

I recognize the ways marijuana is helping with my chronic pain and mental health. At the same time however, I feel like I'm in a haze most days. Fibromyalgia can cause ""fibro fog"" when the pain gets bad too, so I have to choose if I want fibro fog or a drug haze.

It feels like I've gone from using marijuana in a healthy, medicinal way to using it excessively. Is there a way to balance this? Should I stop smoking altogether for awhile and just deal with my symptoms?

I've tried using pharmaceuticals to treat the ptsd and fibro in the past with limited/no success.

I decided last Sunday to call time on smoking due to a number of reasons.  Between not sleeping properly, Chest being sore, Feeling clouded & and many other symptoms of the negative side effects of cannabis, I figured that it was the only way to knock it on its head was to stop. My housemate smokes heavily and gets his supply off my cousin. Last night, they were both in the sitting room and were both rolling up, so I just tried to detach myself from the situation and not join them outside when it was time to spark up. 
I had gotten into a hole with late night smoking and not being able to sleep. I work late, when I finish I usually blaze one and chill until I cant keep my eyes open and get up whenever and see what has to be done. Weed has been robbing me of a consistent lifestyle. I went through a very rough period in may where myself and 40 other people lost very good jobs out of the blue and made us redundant with no pay. The carpet was swept from under me financially, and my college degree suffered. Cannabis was my crutch during the turmoil. The switch I could flick to turn off all of the noise. 

I’m externally resitting this year in college and am making it my goal to get my degree and keep moving forward,

I have found solace in this group and find that its so comforting & inspiring to see that so many people out there are looking to make an active change in their lives, be that giving up weed or other endeavours to better themselves. 

At the start of the week my mood was very hit and miss on some days, sudden strong bouts of self loathing and generally feeling low on some occasions. I have been exercising between weight training and cardio during the week so it was a good counter to the negative withdrawals. 
It’s day 8 technically, but I’m looking at it as the start of week two. I didn’t realise that I would be thinking regularly about it, but I’m putting it down to actually saying goodbye to it for good. If its no longer serving you, cut it out. 

I think this path of giving up going to be very achievable and I hope that you think the same. I was reading one of the posts from earlier in the week and I saw a re-occurring trend of the group saying that they had more time on their hands, or noticed that the week is going slow, which I totally agree on. I have found that there is more time in the week instead of getting stoned and letting the days roll by. I’m sitting in my favourite coffee shop at the moment as I write this, planning out the week and just taking a moment to reflect on the last few days. 
No matter what comes in front of you, put yourself and your health first.
Ill drop in again when its close to the one month mark. 
Have a great week everyone",5

2020-01-20 06:42:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/erc6jm/a_pathway_forward/,A Pathway Forward?,"I actually never thought that I would write in here but today seemed like a poignant time.

Mid-30's now, most of the best opportunities in my life I have squandered most likely due to weed. I have changed a lot of my attitude in the last few years even if I am inherently lazy I have wanted to be a better man and make a contribution to meaning.

I started age 19 and it just seemed to get heavier and heavier.  I have tried to quit many times but relapsed. I was involved in music as hobby and even that ended up suffering. The desire to practice and sing was replaced by the desire to sit and watch shit like Dexter and read the Daily Mail website etc. I thought ""tomorrow, tomorrow"". Then one day you find, 10 years have got behind You, no-one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun"" to quote Pink Floyd.

God I wish I was one if these dudes who are just finishing up their degree or age 22 coming into this wisdom, my wisdom drive did not kick in till much later.

Getting myself into a good degree programme at 28, I thought smoking weed daily was something that could co-exist with making a success of it. Wrong, crashed and burned, couldn't make all those extra opportunities was given count. Couldn't see straight.

Autumn of 2019, quit weed for a week or two, felt great, quit my job, started making plans for something else even taking up loose work abroad, something I could own. Felt great, read leaves, felt I was getting myself back. Then relapsed, don't know how, but others one of those scenarios where youbfalk back into it by giving it as a reward. Never works!

Fast forward to now. I have constant access to the best stuff that I don't need to pay for. So it's always there.

Quit at start of January; oh fuck it is history post Christmas blues I'll have another one. Back on it. 

Set up a gravity bong. Lungs hurting more, mucus production and a wheezing whistle that have me the worst sleep ever the other night while trying to break a bad sleeping pattern. Can't continue like this, can't risk COPD. 

No job yet, on the verge of losing rented property due to arrears. Woke up today 6am 2nd day of key lag on new sleeping pattern. I was waking at 9pm. Changing it and quitting is fucking me mentally.   I even rewarded myself with a couple hits for making the sleep step. Didn't do shit. ASMR no work, dopamine centres frazzled.

My big concern is the cat  who I am going to have to wrestle from her eco system here and take her in unfamiliar territory if I now need to move back in with parents find a job. This was her life and she will need to adjust to move with me cos of my failures.

This is all very well, but two main things I wanted to highlight is that a) weed despite giving me some great teachings and also chill nights listening to music with a beer has caused me to spurn most of the major opportunities in my life so far. I e some up mid 30's with nothing to show aside from a Cat who I cherish. I have not suffered siciakky but I am now someone who doesn't turn up at things because of circumstance and I basically put the foot on the gas of consumption last 5 years.

B) I woke up today with a mind and body depression I have never felt before that scares me. I have green crack here I could easily have done that may make me feel better, but I feel now what I have to give to get that high is not worth it both mentally and physically.

Also, I don't trust myself. I have the sub-personality that will make an appearance and my slide back will likely be subtle and on a jolly night where things are good.

I have came to the conclusion that I have to practice cessation. But it disturbs me that I can never haves smoke again cos I really fucking love It! I never thought I would be addicted to anything.

Finally, my habit has seen me live lives of wretchedness that would shock family and friends, the sheer grubby shamefulness of my existences.

So why am I writing? Well it would be good if I could hear someone say that they can relate to these experiences. Sometimes you feel like surely nobody outside of a junkie has been here.

Who I wish I was; far away in Mid 20th century England, an every day normal Joe who got a trade job and went down the pub on a Friday with his mates and didn't know shit about shit and had a nice normal life with family And spent his 30's working away and making things slightly more profitable. I feel I've seen too much of the wretchedness and if I am honest it's my failure that bring me the most shame. I'm no introvert but I do see things detached from societal reality. I envy normal people sometimes. Bed, rise, work. All so fucking simple isn't it.

One last point, the thought of not ever smoking again, I can't fathom it (even though I have concluded that it is the best logical step. Any guidance on this would be appreciated.

A pathway forward, I think is the thing",4

I'm on my day 2 of quitting, Just had an anxious dream last night + the sweats. I've been reading threads here since last year and you guys make me want to really quit as I can relate to most of you. The demotivation, the cycle of don't wanna smoke, smoke and then anxiety and shakes with a little bit of paranoia then wanting to quit and then later smoke again.

Actually I was sick last year and had a small patch in my lungs. I was on antibiotics for about 5 months. So I know I can't drink alcohol as it can mess up my liver but I still smoked and vaped cartridges as my brain told me, oh it's okay there are no effects. Until I experienced the anxiety and uncontrollable shakes again. So I focused on my medication and tried to be happy with my sobriety. I was able to quit for almost 3 months and I was so afraid to smoke again as I may experience the anxiety again. but then we visited our friends and for me to socialize with them I need booze or weed which is available so I tried it again and it was not bad. So I started to smoke again, once a night then turned to wake and bake then smoking whenever I wanted to. Up until 2 days ago.

I always had the determination to quit but then I fall to dependency. Tried moderation and it doesn't work. it'll work for a week but Im hooked again. Now I really want to quit and be afraid of smoking again as I feel that being afraid of smoking makes me really want to not smoke. (that anxiety and hakes is the worst)

I've been smoking for about 7 or 6 years. I was creative before it and I was into music. Now I'm always demotivated, didn't achieve anything. I didn't learn about music and bad at managing or taking care of our house. I'm also anti-social but I remember being friendly or at least easy to be with before these years. I thought it helped with my anxiety but it made is so much worse.

I want to quit to get back what I lost or what weed took from me. Time and motivation. I also have an 18month old cute little girl to take care of. I don't want to keep forgetting memories. I want to be healthy too as weed demotivates me from exercising.

I apologize if I constructed this paragraph badly or if it's hard to understand as weed also made me dumb.  So yeah I don't want to keep on blaming weed and start to work on myself. I hope you can get something from my story and help you to motivate yourself on quitting. We can do this. We can take our life back. 

feel free to ask me anything, and if you have words of encouragement that would really help. Thank you all!",18

I am so sick of not enjoying the high, of not being motivated to do anything, of not achieving what I want and being stuck in this rut.

I am glad I have this community to help me start off and get on the right track. I am planning for long term sobriety this time. Wish me luck!

I'm a 25 y/oF who has smoked daily multiple times from morning to night every single day for five years. The last two years I have almost exclusively been smoking THC cartridges (mostly black market even though I know how dangerous they are). I usually go through a 1mg cartridge anywhere from 5-7 days. I have tried multiple times to quit, and this thread is THE BEST. I have always been so inspired by everyone on here, even people who relapse and share their ""horror"" stories about how awful it was after they were clean for a while, I read almost everything posted on here everyday. I love you guys as a community!

I'm currently only on Day 3, however every time I get to this point I always cave because I am extremely emotional without it. It seems that I get very worked up easily (irritability I know is a big one for withdrawal), I cry over EVERYTHING bad that pops up into my head, get very upset when people don't want to hangout and take it personally. I'm generally someone with thick skin (I guess when I'm HIGH) but reduce to a puddle of emotions when I am sober. 

&#x200B;

Is this normal? Has anyone else gone through this and noticed a change after a week or two? Will I be happy me again??

This is my first ever Reddit post, so I appreciate any and all advice from you guys.",13

As a little background, I’m 33F.  I’ve been smoking since I was a senior in HS, and have been a heavy smoker since I went to college.  So from 18-33, I smoked multiple times a day (prob 2-5 times).  I was also diagnosed as bipolar 2 a few years ago, so I’m realizing in hind site that smoking for me was not only an escape but also a form of self-medication.  I also drank a lot back then, but quit booze about 2 years ago as well since I’m now on medication.  Anyway, a few months ago, I decided to “cut back” on weed so I went from smoking several times a day to once a week, socially.  That made me feel better for a while.  But recently, I’ve suffered from two panic attacks only 2 weeks apart and a few days after smoking (that has never happened to me).  I’ve just been anxious overall and it’s much more noticeable after cutting back.  I’m not an anxious person by nature, so I decided that it is time to put down the weed for good.

My problem now lies in my social life.  I find it hard to stay completely sober while my friends are getting hammered.  Only one of my friends smokes (and I’ll get to that in a sec), but even when the others are drinking, I always feel tempted to get high (and usually do).  When I’m with my other friend who smokes, it’s kinda just been our normal activity together for years.  I told her I was quitting and she still smoked in front of me.  Dear God I almost caved so many times, but I didn’t.  These are some of my best friends and I don’t really want to limit contact with them.  I just want to know or am wondering how everyone found their sea legs when in a group?  I know I’m new to the sobriety game here, but I feel that social situations are my Achilles heel.  When I’m alone, I don’t really have a problem not smoking anymore.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Today has been pretty good. The mornings are a lot easier now. No more sadness and anxiety in the first hours of my day. I've been sleeping much better but still struggle a little with actually getting to sleep. I'm going to research sleeping techniques in the coming week. The night sweats and bad dreams continue though. Last night I had an attack of sleep paralysis which really terrified me. I haven't had one of these in many years so I caught me off guard.

I did not post yesterday because, honestly, I was pretty miserable. I started the day in a fairly positive mood but, since quitting, it really doesn't take much to turn me 180 degrees. Everything feels slightly bland right now. I have no regrets but I'm struggling to find things to fill my time and I'm not being very productive with my work and studies. On a more positive note, I've been hitting the gym daily and managed to lose the xmas weight gain and more.

But make no mistake.... this is miles away from how I was feeling in the first week. The first 7 days were a nightmare. Now I am MUCH more stable and happy. I think I just need to find some new activities to fill my time and I'll be a lot happier. It's not easy but totally worth it!",3

I guess the breakup was neccessary.
I want ro reconnect with myself. I want to explore my true desires. I numbed myself for so long.

This was one of my main reasons for quitting as I was struggling to cope with the grief and guilt. Since I stopped smoking I have been better able to gradually come to terms with it.  I went to bed and fell asleep quickly  and slept fine, only had a mild night sweat in the early hours and dont remember dreaming. Woke up feeling a bit better and after breakfast finally felt the urge at last to do some painting as I'm into art. Going up the stairs to my studio I had my first weed flashback of my abstinance. Felt stoned for a couple of minutes.  I had been expecting that to happen at some point as I'd had several last time I stopped. When that had passed I started painting and at first I was fine but then I started getting massive cravings. I always smoked weed while painting but thought I might be ok after nearly a month, obviously not! I'm not sure whether it was the flash back or the association with painting or because it was the weekend as I tended to smoke it up all day for both days. Possibly it was a combination of all of them. One thing I do know is that writing my thoughts on here really helps.

Every summer i go to some, and since I stopped smoking this has been giving me some thought.

I'm not in the position where I know I'll smoke, since I don't have the desire to consume, and I'm enjoying sobriety and don't want to relapse. 

But I think while there, at the festivals, I'll want to smoke, since the days are full of just music, camping and a carefree environment. If I smoke though, I'll probably have the urge to smoke more when I get back home, which I plan on fighting.

Then again, and some of you may say this, I can enjoy the festivals sober, but it seems like a setting in which it's actually okay to be high, without it harming my daily life, since I won't have any responsibilities.

I see posts on here about people feeling better after two weeks, but I'm almost onto my third and don't feel like it's getting any better. I never felt like this at all when I was smoking (obviously, I was stoned all the time) which suggests to me that this is all withdrawal related, and I really don't feel like seeing a doctor would help.

I'm aware I felt like this last Sunday and survived the week, but I'm getting sick of feeling like this. I get that 4 years of smoking has done its damage, and that 3 weeks is nothing in comparison, but any advice or similar stories that others are going through somewhat make me feel like I'm not alone.

The last year i bought a dynavap and start consuming a lot more. Now that i got the chance to do it, i got diagnosed with High intellectual potential, Hypersensitivity, Dyspraxia and there might be some ADHD syndrom in the mix too. The psychologist says that weed is not good for me as it would be to put a leach on a feral horse, but it's not bothering me that much.

Life has always been overwhelming for me, i'm shy and i don't feel good about being different than the average person. But i'm just hiding myself by smoking. It must have been months since i last ""felt good"". I'm stuck in a boring job that i might lose everytime i choose to smoke again, all my hobbies feel pointless, and i have no goal in life, aside from being left alone to chill. No self-trust, average to high anxiety.

Since december i've been researching a lot on what weed is really doing to me, and while it's calming to have it, it's too comfy to be safe. Everytime i try to be myself, people don't understand me, and my feelings are just too much. I've succeed to stop for like a week or so around the end of the year, but now i kinda didn't want to anymore, it's really hard for me, and learning to live with what the diagnose teach me is really hard. I feel like nobody has ever understand me, even family and friends, so i like to keep all relationship as the strict minimum.

I don't know what i'm doing right now, i don't like my life, but i don't know what i could do, my only diploma is in environnement expertise, which is filled with corruption and personal gain in my country, i'm happy to be able to maintain myself alive without depending on other, but i feel bad every damn day and i want that shit feel to stop. When everything turns to s\*\*\* i'm glad to be able to smoke, but i see clearly that this is a vicious circle, i just don't have the motivation to stop. I often think ""this is as good as it gets for me, it's quite alright"", and yet people keep presuring me to have/get more, it's tyring.

Pretty much sums up the thing, i also have some trust issues, that's why it's a brand new account.

But before I start I have to tip my hat to everyone who is trying to quit right now. I've been lurking around and have read some amazing stories. 

I've been smoking daily for about 6 years now. It starts when I wake up and ends when I go to bed. I first started smoking to help with my PTSD and anxiety attacks, now I don't know why I smoke... 
Until recently, I grew my own and always had more than enough for myself and gave some away to friends. Basically it's always been available. 
But now I've decided to give it up. I started by tearing down the grow room. Got rid of all the paraphernalia except a single bong (sentimental value) and my vape. I've tried quitting multiple times over the past month but fail without making it a single day..
Now, to add to this, I work from home. That means smoking is just part of my routine. It's like making coffee while you get ready for work, you just do it and don't think about it. That's what's making it hard for me. Not the high, I don't even get high anymore, just the routine. 
So, like I said, I failed to make it a single day before but I need to do this. Today I'm throwing out the rest of my crop and pushing forward. I would be lying if I said I was confident in myself this time but thought I'd I posted it then maybe that would put some measure of responsibility on me.

I quit drinking alcohol on new year's day after a terrible hangover. I'm already feeling better, but smoking is still in my way of taking care of my mental health.

I do have plans and things i want to try doing before i go to university so it doesn't sound like it. 
I don't know why i told you that story, i just really needed to post that title there.

I would smoke an oz every 4-5 day’s during this time, and I wasted so much of my life doing this.
I dropped out of college, moved in with my girlfriends grandma, and gave up all my hobbies over the course of my extreme addiction. I lost most of my friends due to me neglecting my friendships. I seriously lowered my quality of life for something that I thought was “helping” me. I haven’t been living, I’ve just been alive. 

I’ve know that I had a problem, but I just haven’t had the power to stop this endless cycle of self destruction, and I’m so grateful that around the start of the new year I decided to quit, or so I thought.

I went 6 days off of weed, and then decided to smoke last Saturday after the passing of a friend. I hotboxed outside my job (stupid right?) and within minutes I started experience the worst panic attack of my life while under the influence. I couldn’t breathe and I went on endless thought loops, feeling as if I’d finally broken my already fragile mind state. I even ended up driving to an ER out of fear that I was having a heart attack, and I just sat in the lobby just in case I started to die. I know this sounds dramatic, but at the time it was very real to me. I even felt weird a couple of day’s afterwards, almost derealization and depersonalized. 

Since then I have not touched weed or even thought of touching it. My mental state has improved since the days after and I haven’t even craved it once, I can’t even think of doing it again. I have finally passed the point of craving it, and all I crave now is a clear sober mind. I know it’s early in my journey, but I’m 100% convinced that this time is it. I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s a very peaceful feeling. The only thing I crave now is getting more out of life than living in a constant mirage of happiness, which would always recede while in the haze that I’ve been in for 5 years. That’s all I have to share, I’m finally free regardless any cravings that may come.

TL;DR I smoked weed after 6 days of sobering up and had a massive panic attack, and now I want nothing to do with weed.",11

2020-01-19 02:51:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eqtis0/i_declare_freedom/,I declare Freedom,"Long, disorganized but I let my mind fly on this one. Today is the day the rest of my life will begin. I couldn’t count the amount of times I have uttered that phrase only to perpetually fail soon after such a proclamation has been made, honestly, I’d be embarrassed to know.

So, Why am I suddenly in my phone notes tapping furiously about this one? I’m not a religious woman, but I’ve seen enough of life’s lows to have developed some sort of spirituality. I mediate at night to help with sleep, about a week ago, I planted a mind seed. 

I saw this meme recently, I can’t remember word for word, but something along the lines of, ‘you wouldn’t keep ripping a seed out of the soil to keep checking on how it’s doing , so why do you keep doing that to yourself? not sure if that’s remarkable for anyone but it was one of those things that clocked me, cold. 
That’s where I got the idea to plant a mind seed. I said to myself , even if it’s the most ridiculous thing, so outlandish , say it say it SAY IT and plant the seed. Fuck it, what did I have to lose. 

I’ve been thinking about quitting smoking weed for a while now, not because I’ve wanted to, but I’m really starting to see time pass me by. I’m 33, I just lost my last grandparent this week. I didn’t go to see my grandma before she died, she was asking for me. The same thing happened with my maternal grandmothers passing 6 years ago. That, of course, is something I regret, brutally. It made me take a look at myself that I had no control over. As if something said sit the fuck down and pay attention. I never questioned it. instead of continue to beat the shit out of myself, something slowed down. 

I have been going back to a psychiatrist and a therapist to treat my ADHD and now possible anxiety. When this came up it shocked me, I never thought I was but I started asking around in my family if they thought I had anxiety. The response was overwhelming and swift, which required me then to take an even deeper emergency look inside, I’m missing a lot here aren’t I? 

I hadn’t smoked for idk almost a day until this afternoon bc I’m scraping. Finally, I go to take a rationed rip, chill back for a second. Up until this point of the day, I’ve been calm, relaxed, in control. The second that hodgepodge of shake hit me, the waves of depression and anxiety swept over me. My mind started racing and my thoughts got so intense, so quickly. Normally, this is how I ALWAYS am so I never related it to weed. 

Immediately, amateurishly , I googled ‘can weed cause anxiety?’ Me at 33, started smoking at 13, daily since 18 and my neuron-rich brain never made this connection? Surely, I can recall on the low end, a million people mentioning something...right? Guess I never heard them. 

For so many years, weed has made me blind to life. Along with losing my grandmother this week, something polarizingly great happened to me. l moved into a beautiful apartment with my incredible girlfriend. This event was something we have been working towards, to start our first home together. What a splendid thing, a dream manifested, a goal realized, victors in love. I see my life, this new life for the first time in such a state that I made a promise to myself, an unshaking commitment to refuse to lose what I have. That’s the difference between all those other times and this time. 

I will never be able to sustain the life I’m living continuing in the direction I was headed. I finally love someone more than myself, someone that gave me enough love and support to pull me out of my selfobsessions even if just for a moment to see things differently. to see that I’m worth loving enough to love myself. 

I feel relief, because before this epiphany, I was scared. How could I ever live without weed, I didn’t think I could. I realize my mindset has been shit previously, I’m praying my thoughts have transformed, that I’ve shed an excruciating layer. they say without destruction there is no transformation and I believe this to be true, my past doesn’t have to hold me back. I choose to be free today, to live the life I’ve always dreamed. The peace I was missing all this time is about to return.

Much love, thanks for reading.",26

I started smoking when I was around 20, and I'm soon turning 24, which makes it around 4 years. In those 4 years, I have been high everyday, except one time I tried to quit and lasted for 4 days. 

The time it all really went shit, was when I broke up with my ex around when I was 21, because she didn't know that i smoked and she really hated people that did smoke. After the break up, the amount of weed smoking has just been increasing, and as of today, I have smoked 49 bong hits.

I'm currently in university, and I can really feel the weed affect my motivation and thrive do stuff. I love school and I really enjoy sensation from learning, but for the last year, I haven't done homework, stopped caring, and missed a lot of school days, all I get done is smoking weed and play video games.

I really can't take it anymore. I want to quit, and want to get my life together, but it just don't know how. Today I used my last cigarette for a mix, and told myself, that after this, I'll be smoke free. No more weed, time to pull my own weight, and actually do something meaningful with my life, instead of just wasting it on weed and playing video games.

I guess what I'm really asking for, is some help and motivation to make this the one that counts

Thanks so much for your time, and sorry for the wall of text

I'm pushing through all the withdrawals I experience, I refuse to go back to that lifestyle. I'm just so happy and proud of myself for doing it finally.

This time was different, I had a very good reason to stop because my addiction was making me verbally aggressive with my friends so the first 2 weeks were rather ""easy"". But this week I went out 4 times getting really drunk twice, I'm clearly compensating... The anxiety is killing me right now and my lazy depression is keeping me from doing meditation and exercising.

I realize now I've been depressed for a while (it's not new but being high made me feel like I wasn't anymore) and it's all coming back strongly since I'm sober. At the beginning I was proud because I had finally put my shit together to get better habits. But now I'm worried I was just playing a ""happy healthy guy"" part, just as when I'm high I play the ""chill stoner"" part... I REALLY want to smoke right now.

I was with friends last night and I told this girl I like about it and she thought it was really cool I stopped, mentioning a friend we have in common who stopped too, saying she likes him better sober. I think I scored some points there. And now she has seen me blackout drunk at a bar (I think I even cried at some point but I don't remember the end of the evening very well), and I just feel shame and self hatred.

I seriously thought I was fucking retarded and getting more retarded by the day. (Just for reference: I am a professional woman with 2 degrees currently in education.) And 2.) I'm trying to get pregnant. Tbh I've been trying to get pregnant for over a year without success. My Dr was aware of my weed usage and encouraged me to stop but I kept going because my sisters are also heavy smokers and they had no problem conceiving, maintaining their pregnancies and giving birth to reasonably intelligent,  ""normal"" healthy children (no judgements please) So I knew getting high wasn't an issue...or was it??

And I really felt great. Sure, I had bad anxiety, trouble sleeping. But I felt in control of my life for the first time in a long time.

Yesterday I had a day off. My morning started with a bit of stress and disappointment, cause some plans I had fell through. My anxiety started swirling around me, and I wasn’t thinking clearly. I wanted to ESCAPE. 

My friend was rolling a spliff while I was making breakfast. The thought crossed my mind, “fuck it, why don’t I just have a few puffs to take my mind off my stress for a bit?”

A few hours later, I snuck into my roommates room, took a big nug from his jar, ground it up and smoked a bowl. And maybe 30 minutes later, another one. The whole time this relapse was happening, I knew it wasn’t me. I was like, looking down on myself from above, watching me fiend out for weed again.

 In the end, it wasn’t worth it. I ended up binging on shitty food and video games, feeling kinda sick and groggy, and totally disoriented for the rest of the day. I had a show to play that night and I couldn’t get out of my head the whole time. I smoked again with friends after the show on the back porch.

Every time I took a hit, I was thinking about the next one. I am an addict.

I am disappointed in myself. I was so proud of myself for 1 week. But I’m going to get RIGHT BACK ON THE HORSE and keep recovering. Because this is about taking back my life for good.

I love this community. I just need some words of encouragement this morning to help me get back on the right path.",10

Then I got laid off. It's hard to find a job this time of year cuz everyone's waiting to see 4th quarter earnings first, but I'm trying my hardest.  

Meanwhile, I've had a lot of time to sit with myself, and process all these emotions so I can be fully present. I finally let the idea of quitting bubble up to the surface, and become a full concept: I need to quit. Weed is the only thing holding me back in just about every way that it could.

It took me some time to really admit to myself that this is a problem. It's hard to sit with. I also suffer from anxiety and PTSD, so I was in a mental battle with myself, fearful of what it might be like sober...and thinking its going to suck.

Regardless, I took the first step of quitting cold turkey. Had I not been laid off from my job, I wouldn't have received this amazing gift of TIME to look in the mirror with honesty like that.

Therefore, let me say that I am GRATEFUL that this happened. I have finally identified the heaviest weight I carry around, and am taking action to shed it. Today is my 8th day sober, and I'm feeling more vibrant and alive with each passing day. It only got hard last night being Friday night, since I have associated that with getting fucked up since I was 13 when I started drinking too...(Have smoked since I was 11). So its gonna take some strength to snap that notion about friday off. But like a branch in my way on a forest trail, I will break it.",3

This post isn't about me staying away from weed though I do hope to be able to make a post like that soon enough. 

I'm just going to write down my thoughts atm.

I want to quit weed
I want to save money. 
I want to look for a job
I want to learn new stuff 
I want to not have to seek around the house to smoke. 
I want to have REM sleep.
I want to try for to look for a gf/partner
I want to gain self respect
Www.

I know im not going to die if I stopped weed , everyday I just feel the need to have it. Ive been through stages where i should have stopped so i dont fail uni but still continued and failed uni. 

I get benifit money and use that to buy weed. 

Other than that life is good, people have it much harder which is why cant be happy with myself until i have accomplished something that i put hard work into",24
2020-01-18 11:02:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eqi3s5/where_do_i_start/,Where do I start?,"I guess weed has always played a role in my life. As long as I can remember, my older sister and cousins would sneak out and smoke a J at family functions and come back stoned. Around 12, I took my first hit with my sister in the front of my house and it was honestly a great experience. I laughed until I cried, munched out, and watched movies all day. 

Since then, I’ve been smoking weed on and off for about 6 years (I’m 18 now), and at this point, it has become a little exhausting. 

Every once and a while I would take little 2 or 3 month breaks every now and then just to get away from it, and I would feel amazing during that break, but I would always fall back into old habits. 

My boyfriend died around 6 months ago from pancreatic cancer. He’s my soulmate. He loved everyone and shined light everywhere he walked. Life without him is a struggle, and since he passed, I haven’t stopped smoking. Mainly because most of the smoking I did my senior year of high school was with him. It made us really close. We’d stay up all night talking about anything and everything, watching movies, and hotboxing his Jeep in my front yard. In some ways, smoking makes me feel a bit closer to him. I miss him so much, but I fear smoking isn’t the right coping mechanism. I’ve been high almost everyday since the day he passed and nothing feels real anymore. These past few months have felt like a blur. I miss the genuine person I was with him. 

I don’t know who to turn to. I’m in college and everyone around me smokes and all my friends come to my apartment to match. It’s fun. I just don’t know who I am when I’m not high anymore. I feel like I’m losing myself. I really want to make a change for the better I just don’t know how to stop. I easily fall into temptation to numb my pain. I’m scared. I know once I stop things will change. I don’t know where to start and I could really use some advice.",3

Day 15 - Coughing becomes less severe

Day 21 - No more Insomnia and Night Sweats

Day 28 - Appetite returns

Day 28 - Within 28 days after ceasing cannabis use, the receptor density throughout most of the brain returns to normal, except in the hippocampal region associated with learning and memory, which recovers but takes longer. Cannabis dependence is associated with CB1R downregulation, which begins to reverse surprisingly rapidly upon termination of cannabis use and may continue to increase over time.

 Day 35 - Often mistaken with depression, lethargy ceases and energy levels go back to normal

Day 42 - You probably metabolized all of the THC

Day 45 - Concentration begins to improve and attention span returns to normal

 Day 56 - Anxiety and depression decrease and emotional stability returns to brain

Day 70 - Sharpness of mind returns, unconscious memory continues to improve

Day 90 - most people by this stage feel mostly normal

It can be done I’m still surrounded by cannabis smokers most days as family/friends still smoke but no urge to have a puff or two my self which im proud of showing my self I’m stronger/strong minded than I ever thought I would be I can’t wait to be able to say I haven’t smoke for months and months still a long road and I’m guessing a lot of bumps to come but I’m determined and have support from family that gives me that boost so I don’t feel like I’m going on this journey alone.

il never go back to it now! at first I was cutting down but when you smoke like I did there is no such thing as cutting down lol as before long it be back to joint after joint. I’ve been told I’m more talkative my mother has said she’s starting to find out who her son actually is when I’m round for a cup tea. I’m 27 lol hearing that makes you think rah was I really that unsociable through out my teens and twenty’s

Now only one and have had 2 cups of coffee in 3/4weeks apart from my 8/9 cups daily any time day or night it’s mad how much better I feel in my self.

Also I’m doing a lot more with my family now I have two young boys and used to be to lazy as stoned to go out and do things now I’m even getting dragged in Tesco/Town centre etc with missis and not even moaning or in my head can’t be arsed lol and anyone who has a missis who loves shopping will understand how much of a madness it can be but I’m doing it and loving it sounds stupid probably but before it was like nah nah I’m busy or just some excuse because I would be high out my head.",11

I was hooked and I know most of us were hooked because we were medicating an underlying problem. Sometimes because it's scary making real change and weed makes you feel comfortable. Find out what the problems are and tackle them. Go get therapy. Go see a doctor.  Go to the gym and work on the body you want. Go take that vacation. Save up the money for things and life you desire. Go find that new job. Pursue that career you want. Go meet new people. Buy new clothes. Get a hair cut or your hair done. Do the things you really want to do. Do self care and self love. Fulfill your life with things more fulfilling than weed and see just how little it will matter to you. The one thing I felt I couldnt live without doesn't matter to me anymore. 

It's not easy. It takes time. I failed a lot. I relapse a lot. Sometimes when someone offers I take it.  I'm not perfect. But good lord I've come such a long way.

I live on the east coast so it’s freezing outside which made me even more worried. I looked everywhere and couldn’t find him. I was beyond devastated. My heart was shattered. My cat is basically my emotional support buddy, and we are extremely bonded. I was wailing uncontrollably to the point where I couldn’t breathe. After 5 long hours of super heavy sobbing and screaming, I finally found him (yay for happy endings lol). I write about this experience here to note that while I was hysterically crying, I thought about smoking weed. It wasn’t so much that I wanted to get high to feel good, but more that I knew if I smoked, the intensity of my sadness would dull. Weed always allowed me to numb my emotions so I didn’t feel much of anything. I rarely ever cried when I was high. It just made me zone out so I didn’t feel anything at all. I considered the idea of smoking for a moment (because the constant crying was emotionally and physically exhausting), but ultimately I didn’t smoke and I’m proud of myself for that.

How I used to smoke a blunt by myself before going out, about ripping lines of blow as I take shots and get ready for the night and nearly every ounce of me wants to get back to it like I never stopped. The feeling of that first pull on a perfectly rolled blunt, that fire in your soul after your first line, the burn of a shot of whiskey and smoking a cigarette after. I love it all, I've always loved it, I just hate the consequences after. 

I'm starting to realize this is just a step in maturity. The young part of me misses that part of my life in a nostalgic way, the way I miss my blankie and disney movies on a rainy day as a kid. But if I do it at this age I'd feel like a fool, the same way I'd have a panic attack if I smoked and the same way I'd hate myself for two weeks if I did blow. Making it past this nostalgia and finding new things in life to look foward to is the only way to move past the old. 

I'm not going back, because I remember day 3, possibly one of the worst days of my life but I miss it, I want it like I want to breathe, and I needed to say it before I go out tonight. It's okay to want these things, it's okay to miss them but you have to remember the momentary benefit isn't worth the long term consequence. My goals and health are what matter more than anything. 

Wish me luck! My next goal is to make it 21 days and I bet you I'll see you there. I WILL NOT SMOKE WITH YOU TODAY.",43

2020-01-17 22:07:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eqayu6/strange_experience_after_a_relapse/,Strange experience after a relapse,"Hello Guys,

So after heavy smoking for 10 years, i decided to stop. The trigger came after a friend invited me to some event and the only thing I could think of was the time I lost where iI could get high and play Games. That never happend before so I wanted to change something. I was in my third week of quitting cigarettes so i just decided to add the weed to it.

It somehow didn't cause me much of a problem maybe it was a little because my addive part to nicotine wasn't there anymore. The first night was still very hard, i just lied in bed and read r/leaves which helped me a great deal. 

Day 2 I still kept thinking about it sometimes, but my Mind was already clearer and it was a nice feeling after 10 years. 

Come day 3 it kept getting harder my mind got cloudy, workday was very stressful and I decide instead of weed just smoke 1 cigarettes after work which I did and it helped. Since i didn't have any craving for cigarettes at all it wasn't really a relapse at that front. 

So the next 2 days were really easy because I enjoyed life with a clear mind and didn't think much about weed. Sure when i was at home after work it kept coming to my mind but what can I expect after 10 years of daily smoking. A big help was also the event that my friend invited me to, it was a seminar about your own future and I think everyone who smokes daily knows that you don't have any ambitions for your own future because you are content with what you have right now. So the perspective and thinking of my futzre helped me change my mindset a lot.

Now comes day 6. I had a very nice day with a friend and I literally enjoyed walking outside and just seeing the views and enjoying the fresh air. I was always like, why should i go for a walk when i can smoke and chill at home. Now comes the evening. I was supposed to get a package and here when a signature is not needed they normaly let it in front of your door. I got the message that it was delivered, but after coning home i didn't see it. So one of my neighbors decided to steal the package from infront of my door. This never happened before and it was something that I needed tomorrow. I was really angry, so I searched my whole appartment and found a little bit. I rolled it, got ready, put on a movie and lit it up. After taking 2 hits i already started to feel it a little bit and it wasn't nice. My mind wasn't clear anymore. I destroyed the joint flushed it down the toilet and decided to make a post because i needed to tell someone. I was really damn proud of myself.

I can't really explain why but I somehow think everything from quitting cigarettes to my friend inviting me to the event and me enjoying life with a clear Mind played a role in this. I hope and will also do everything in my power to never smoke again.

I don't know if this helps someone but I neede to get it off my chest.",4

2020-01-17 21:34:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eqalus/i_failed/,I failed...,"Yesterday I smoked. I was about to reach about 2 weeks of being weed free and was happy about it. I had been on vacation, happy about not having to worry about when and where and how to smoke, but it still drained me to have to spend so much time with family (I still feel like an introvert and as much as I love them, I really need alone time after a while). So I came home and was looking forward to a videogame filled night, that's what triggered me I guess and it backfired. I lied to myself (once again) saying ""It's been almost two weeks, what could it hurt?""

So, I did. And I almost immediately regretted it. I started playing and felt so sluggish that I stopped after about half an hour. My whole reason was to play some games and it took away all my motivation for it the moment I did. It felt just like ""too much work"" to keep playing. I'm writing this to remind my future self: DON'T SMOKE, IT'S A WASTE OF TIME, YOU'LL WASTE YOUR TIME AND WON'T DO WHATEVER YOU THINK YOU'LL DO WHILE HIGH. I played a little more today and of course I play better, I actually pay attention to the game and can function. Playing games should be a reason to not smoke, not a reason to smoke. 

On top of that I woke up with a headache, I still have very low motivation to do anything and have been feeling groggy all day. I noticed that I definitely felt more irritable this morning at silly things as well. I feel disappointed at myself because of course I knew I didn't ""need"" to smoke, I wasted my entire night for no reason other than this addictive behavior that makes no real sense. 

So, day 1, here we are again. I'll try to remember to read this next time I have a similar ""I should smoke tonight, no big deal"" feeling. It's not worth it. Another bothersome thing that I've known but want to remember is my inability to be ""un-high"" after I smoke until I go to sleep and even this next day. Day 1 is the hardest because of this, each day getting better afterwards. I might think that it'll be a ""one night only"" thing, but in reality is a ""one night, next day and probably one more day"" before I go back to being somewhat normal again. I was liking my normal self, I felt quicker and smarter, like I could set tasks for the day and complete them, I feel like a have a plan to follow. I didn't feel like that today and it's because of yesterday's mistake.",11

It’s a complicated situation but basically I never wanted to teach anyway (I have a second major) but so many people pushed me to finish my education degree it that it made me believe I had to just suck it up and student teach. Just as predicted I don’t really like it and also it’s not a very good placement situation in terms of the people I’m working with. The point is I’ve not been this constantly anxious in a really long time and I feel like smoking would help me calm down. I’m soooo tempted to go out and buy a cart, just to have to relax on the weekends.

But I know that I’m an addict. And having some *just* for the weekend will quickly bleed into the weekdays too and all the reasons I quit in the first place like parinoia and even worse anxiety and procrastination will just come right back. This is a terrible time to start smoking again. I’m in charge of children!! What if I get drug tested?! I keep telling myself that to talk myself out of it but I just so badly want to be numbed a little.

I’ve been feeling mildly depressed since I quit and sometimes I think about how great my life was when I was smoking. I was so happy! Everything was fun! But then I remember it wasn’t always like that. I was so zoned out I was missing out on life. I only remember being happier then because of the life situation I was in, not because of the weed. And I was starting to get depressed before I quit tbh, which is a big reason I made the decision to stop in the first place. I haven’t posted here in a really long time because I’ve mostly been doing okay but I feel like it’s been so long I forget what smoking ever day was really like: I forget all the negatives and only crave the relaxing high. I don’t want to get into a vicious cycle of self-medicating and going through all the shit of quitting again, but the world just feels like too much to handle right now.

I planned on going back to smoking after the sleep study but then I noticed something.

My tics were only as bad as my stress, which is manageable on its own. Pots not necessary anymore. Unfortunately, I still enjoyed it. My first time smoking again after the sleep study I had a panic attack. Not good

Tried again later with smaller amounts, less anxiety but then I couldn't focus on other things I wanted to do, like playing the piano, writing and making art. It's awfully inconvenient.

2020-01-17 13:18:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eq44ye/49th_day_slow_and_steady/,"49th Day, Slow and Steady","Hello everyone, my name is Eric and I have used cannabis starting sophomore year in college, almost daily for ten years, with spurts of sobriety due to the legal system. I moved from Missouri to Colorado in late 2014 and my intake increased heavily to every day, and eventually to all throughout the day. I was utilizing concentrate so I didn't smell on the job as a software engineer. The stuff here is high quality and affordable. I used to suffer from seizures and was taking a pharmaceutical, so it was easy for me to get a medical card to make it even more affordable and accessible. The pharmaceutical made me feel blah and cannabis helped me feel kind of ok again.

In 2017 I began practicing a form of yoga called Kundalini yoga, almost daily. This practice started to shift my perception about my pharmaceutical and my cannabis use. I knew I needed to stop, so I started with the pharmaceutical. It took 19 months of tapering from that terrible drug, but I finally took the last 25mg in May 2019. I used cannabis mostly throughout my taper, although the last five months I stopped since tapering really made me feel weird, almost indescribable feelings of weird, and felt it would be easier tapering without cannabis.

The day after taking my last dose, I dove in to the deep end with cannabis. I was using an ounce every two weeks, edibles daily, and vape pens. This continued for a little over six months, and I was rolling downhill fast. I was starting to feel the effects of aging and inactivity. I used to race half-ironman triathlons, but stopped in 2016 due to seizures, and sitting on my ass exacerbated the problems. I stopped practicing yoga. I really felt like was on a fast track to death. My software engineer contract ended in May, almost simultaneously as ending the pharmaceutical (life is funny). So I really had nothing to do except get high. I took up golfing in August, so that helped keep me a little sane, although you know I was golfing high. Then I got a new job in September, but my focusing abilities were so far gone, I was practically useless as a coder.

Fast forward to November, before Thanksgiving, I flew home to Missouri, but not without bringing capsules filled with infused coconut oil. Wow, was I gone, and my family could tell. I needed the capsules to get through the day even around loving family. I even swallowed a few in secret while at the Thanksgiving dinner, multiple times. No one really talked to me about my use because I have a medical card and cannabis helps some people with seizures, although I knew from experimentation that the cannabis or CBD doesn't effect my seizure disorder. Interestingly it was the pharmaceutical that put me at higher risk if I didn't take it.

November 29th was the day I took my final capsule. Only through grace however, and no large push on my own part. Before flying home for the holiday, I reluctantly signed up for my instructors week-long yoga retreat in Costa Rica. I knew I needed to go, but it was expensive, and I obviously knew it would hurt withdrawing since I've dealt with withdrawal symptoms before. But it was either this, or continue rolling down the hill into the abyss.

So I took the long trip to Costa Rica (> 10 hours to the resort) without any capsules. What happened there was truly how I started to climb back out of my hole. I received the most powerful dose of healing one could possibly receive in a week. Even while withdrawing, which consisted of sleeping barely a few hours a night, constantly increased heart rate, nightmares, losing 5% bodyweight, the yoga practice and the ocean and the community of my fellow practitioners carried me through. Definitely could not have made it alone. I cried, no, I balled multiple times per day the entire week. Wow did that crying help the process. Swimming in the salty warm ocean, letting Mother Earth wash away my sorrows. The powerful yogic practices which focus on breath. I cannot stress enough how helpful retreat is for us to heal from the daily stresses we take.

Fast forward to today, here I am, and I haven't had a desire to use cannabis since I returned. I still have all the tools, wraps, bongs, chillums, and the capsules, I even have some good weed and kief in my drawer, but I know I cannot go back down that road.

It's still extremely difficult functioning day to day.

My systems have not yet returned to proper working order. I can tell my body and mind are out of sync with reality. I feel off most times of the day, especially at night trying to sleep. It's really tough being patient, but this recalibration of the body/mind system takes time, especially after such a prolonged period of heavy cannabis use. I do practice yoga twice daily, Kundalini yoga in the morning and Yin yoga in the evening, I feel good after practicing yoga. Plus I have have to either walk or ride my bike the two miles to and from the gym, and that's great exercise. I find moving around the best possible freedom for my mind.

I still have addictive tendencies like obsessive screen time, laying in bed for 10-12 hours, and only eating stimulating foods. My motivations are slowly returning, but sleeping kind of makes me feel like I have to start all over again. I want to eat better, but my body and mind scream at me to eat chips and salsa, guacamole, hummus, salty stimulating foods. Could be worse I know, but it's definitely an addictive trait. I stopped drinking coffee, but I make fresh Chai tea every day and that uses black tea. I sweeten it with maple syrup and add milk. It's good stuff but I know I overdo it.

Another poster said they are two years free and started returning to normal 9 months in. That post is what motivated me to write one. We have to stay strong together in this meantime while we recalibrate our bodies to functioning without cannabis. It's a rough path to walk, but ultimately I know I will be much better off mentally, physically, and spiritually for the rest of my life.

Stay strong fellow leavers. One moment at a time.",8

I got a severe cold the Saturday after new year's.  Some of the symptoms have been hanging on like never before.  I am usually only down a few days.  I made it worse by going out for a few beers with a friend last Friday. At least I didn't make everything much worse by getting stoned.

I went to the Dr yesterday because my throat is still really sore...  tested and found no strep.  She suggested I try some plain old sudafed to try and clear out all the sinuses.  

It seems that any form of intoxication can be a slippery slope.  That sudafed really got me feeling my zoomies yesterday.  As I headed out in the afternoon to take the dog for a walk, ""it"" crossed my mind for the first time in many weeks.  As if a walk with my pup wasn't enough, it would be nice to be a little stoned.  As soon as I had that thought I shook it off.  I am guessing that was my old reaction when trying to figure out how mellow out the sudafed buzz pings.  On the bright side it did seem to clear some congestion and I had less nasal mucus blowout when I woke up this morning. 

Aside from that blip, overall I have been temptation free and progressively more relieved every day I get away from weed.  As always the key seems to be staying busy or at least engaged/interested in other things.  Outside of my job, I have been working on painting the living room. Next step is to replace the carpet with some sort of wood or laminate flooring. In the evenings I have been catching up on some old well rated movies that I have never seen.  

One of my favorite benefits of getting away from weed is still the sensation of time passing more slowly.  It feels like I have enough time to get some things accomplished as well as relax a little bit.

* having some anxious and uneasy moments a few times a week
* having vivid and often disturbing dreams many times a week
* feeling well rested and ready for the day in the mornings compared to old weed mornings
* feeling more connected to friends and family
* feeling pretty sharp overall even considering the cold
* I need to improve on my self reflection via a daily journal.  I am way off track on that.  

I have been less engaged here on /r/leaves since mid Dec when I went on a vacation.  That might be a bad sign, so I will be trying and check in and sort by new more often.  I have to admit the wave of New Years new leaver traffic here was a little overwhelming.  I really believe that service to others is a key to this process.  Focusing on someone else's problems seems to be a great distraction from my own problems/anxieties. Right now the most convenient way for me to achieve that in a daily pattern is probably trying to offer help here. 

If not for my 3 months of relapse this past summer, I would be over 400 days now.  So in my overall pot life timeline (started weed in 1992), this has been a huge stretch of clarity for me.

Since then I've relapsed four times, but in that period I've been mostly sober (14/18 days), haven't smoked any two days in a row, enjoyed a good streak of 8 days in the middle, and have generally had the sensation of ""failing forward"" in those moments of weakness when I have fallen back on old habits.

After coming back home to the Netherlands last week (where weed is legal and easily accessible), I struggled for the first few days with jet lag etc., so now I'm celebrating my first three-day streak since being back home and in my normal week-to-week routine, which feels pretty momentous. It's like I'm finally reaching equilibrium. My desire to smoke has been *mostly* minimal, except at key moments of the day (usually leaving work and right after dinner), which I attribute to the fact that I'm not putting all of my energy into *not* smoking but rather staying focused on what I *am* doing, the new lifestyle I'm building for myself, which right now includes a lot of yoga, journalling, cooking, reading, and generally practicing self-care.

Today I was off work so I slept in and FINALLY got the first good night's sleep I've had this year, so I'm feeling really great. Of course it's still a bumpy road, but I'm reminding myself every day that this is a long-term process and bad days are all part of the journey.

A word of encouragement to those posting things like ""day one again"" here: take your relapses seriously, but don't use them to beat yourself up, and don't let them convince you that ending your streak means starting over. Every hour spent sober and focused on your new life is an hour of tremendous value, and the things you learned in that hour never disappear for good.",3

I posted recently about how I was whittling my use down bit by bit. I don’t think I made a mistake at all not going totally cold turkey like a few people people seemed to insist it was necessary to. Gradually reducing the amount I was smoking I feel really helped me adjust to less and less, and my first day has been pretty successful! 

I just want to say thank you to everyone who has posted all their experiences on this subreddit, victories and relapses alike. Reading all your experiences has made me hopeful, excited and enthusiastic about quitting. Even the relapses. It’s amazing what a supportive community this is. Thank you. 

I feel a little different, but alive and well and perfectly happy with my decision. I think another thing that has helped me is a simple little book I picked up off amazon, after reading the sample for the first chapter I decided it was for me. If it helps, it’s simply titled “quitting weed” by Matthew Clarke. I’m only about halfway through but some of the things it has to say are so helpful. I definitely recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a concise and straight to the point book about quitting. Definitely helpful. 

I’m anxious but also very excited about carrying on the journey I just officially started today. It’s bittersweet, like saying goodbye to an old friend who’s been around for as long as you can remember but has been known for being a bit of a twat. Weed is that friend to me, and I’m okay saying goodbye because I realise this toxic friend is no good for me. I deserve much better friends in my life, ones who will enrich my experiences and push me to make the most of my existence. 

Last time I quit, I quit for so long and I’ve never felt better. I can’t wait for the withdrawal to be over, and I can’t wait to pick up where I left off. All I want is to be happier and healthier.",3

I'm going home in two days and I'm quite worried that my first order of business will be to pick up some hash and numb the mental pain. 

I had plans to meet with a girl, but with my emotions in complete chaos I am afraid that it isn't a good idea. 

But I'm really looking forward to getting home and  playing my favourite video game, partially because of not playing it for a while and all the new stuff that has happened, but mostly because I know with this break my reaction times will be better and this will make me perform better. 

I'm also trying to wind down all the other substance abuse issues I have: drinking to the point of blackout everytime I go out and cigarettes, the latter clearly being the hardest. 

I really hope I can keep it going once I get home. Managing this would be the first step in achieving the ultimate goal of going straight edge.

I'm a teacher and I honestly don't have much free time, but I have always enjoyed getting high. Too much. About 3 years ago my marriage started to die and I couldn't handle it. I started smoking to help me fall asleep and to manage my stress induced stomach ulcer. I started having these terrible binges (I don't know what else to call them) where I would come home after school, or on a weekend, and just smoke non stop and isolate and over eat and disassociate into Netflix and just let the world disappear. 

At first it was just an afternoon or Sunday, and it felt... earned. Soon it started happening every weekend. It felt horrible. It wasn't fun, but I felt like I couldn't stop. I felt too much shame to reach out for help, even when I was desperate to confess. It started to affect my work. I have never gone to teach while high, but I would come after a weekend of weed binging and be unprepared and not at all the teacher I can and must be. Hence, more and more shame, which only makes the urge to disassociate stronger. 

I realized several months ago that I am an addict and I need to quit. I feel like I've always known, even before my use negatively affected my life. I have taken so many baggies of weed and just thrown them in the trash, proclaiming I was quitting for good. Sometimes I dig it out of the trash. Sometimes I pour poison or dish soap into the trash so I won't do that. Other times I make it a few days, maybe even a week, and then I contact a dealer because I can't handle the withdrawal and the cravings get insane. My life will feel empty. My stomach will hurt, I won't be able to sleep, and I will feel no creativity in my work while I detox. I know I need to stop. I know I am an addict with marijuana specifically. But no matter how firmly I make the decision, I continue to relapse. I waste so much money buying an ounce, binging, feeling shame and then throw it away, only to buy more a week later. I feel insane, but I'm terrified I'll never figure out how to control myself. Right now I have so much work to do but my mind is buzzing with desire, and as much as I tell myself no to, I know I'm going to use. I might outlast the craving an hour, a day, a week... But I always give in. I run ultra marathons and manage a high school Theatre program... I have TONS of willpower and discipline... Why can't I control myself with weed?

I'm 29, married, graduate student, and I have been a heavy stoner since 2015. My wife doesn't smoke, and my peers are all straight edge. I've been getting a kick out of being the secret-stoner in the crowd for some time. However, I seem to accidentally developed some sort of addiction. I've really not experienced any obstacles to smoking more and more often; but after years of thinking I was getting away with something, I see now how dependent I am on the morning joint.

The first 1h30m after taking a hit is the very best. It works for me as an upper. I'm creative, attentive to others, and I take my busy schedule seriously. When I discovered this, I thought I had hacked the system! I could manage a busy schedule, be charismatic, be more eager, AND be nice and crispy , all at once! I took it as a point of pride that I could be stoned and still read ancient languages (I'm a classicist). When I think about this now it sounds perverse. 

But I have been really stupid. While I could pass courses and be a husband and do chores and still be a stoner, I realize now that this is a non-adaptive coping strategy (got this term from my therapist). I've driven myself into a deep rut. As an example, if someone always needs a hot bath first thing in the morning in order to manage the day, this is a coping strategy, and in a sense a dependency. But a dependency on hot baths can be tolerated and it doesn't inhibit any aspect of your life. I need a joint in the morning in order to face the day. The dependency is not per se the problem. The problem is that I need to smoke a joint or 3 everyday, and my mind and body can't tolerate it anymore. 

First off, my lungs have taken a battering. Second, I am able to be social, but it is a performance. A good conversation when you're sober is enlightening and refreshing. A good conversation (w/ a sober person) when you're high is an exhausting charade. I don't really connect with people. Third, my ability to moderate my mood is shot through. I am giddy when I'm stoned, but sooner and sooner I feel the anxiety of sobering up, and needing more. I frequently find myself breathless and panicked when I have no reason to be. The disconnect I feel with the world has made me very prone to depression. When I first tried weed I found it so fun to think about my interests with the added psychological enhancement of weed. I thought that thinking was just more fun stoned. As an academic, this sounded exciting! But I realize now that that enjoyment only came when I had months and months of sober thoughts to peruse. But when you're waking and baking months on end, there's an absence of thought. I feel blank and I feel like I have lost the passion from my life. 

I've been attending a marijuana CBT group for a few months now. I've managed a few individual weeks of sobriety at a time, but only hours ago I just stumbled again. I am very lucky to have a supportive wife, access to good medical support, and the money and time to not have this ruin me. But I also feel small and stupid and scared and disappointed. 

I'm not sure what I wanted to get from writing this, only that one of you might recognize my experiences as your own, and that we might feel a little more companionship.",8

I'm a 23 years old Male living alone and working on my own business from home. I'm a programmer and entreprener.

Now this lifestyle as a lot of pros and cons as you will see... 

I have been smoking since I'm 17 years old, but I have really started full-time smoking when I was around 18.

The first few years went well, because I was living with roomates or because I had a lot of activity to do outside of my apartment.

Slowly and slowly, my relationship with Weed went really bad up to the last few weeks.

Last year, I had a great sleep schedule, good eating habits and a good routine for my work schedule.

All this started to slowly crumble in the last year...

Here what has happened:      My business became more popular and we started to have more clients. This gave me a lot of stress and a lot more work to do.   For the stress, I started to smoke more...   But I was less productive, so I needed to work even more hours... This lead to me doing more and more hours but being less and less productive... You see the loop here.

I said alright, I will start to do more exercise instead. But since I started working more and more, I couldn't keep up with the good eating habits and started to eat less and less to be more productive. (Because cooking is long and time consuming) So my eating habits were so bad that I didn't have enough energy to do some basic training. 

 Every day I would train, I would need way more hours of sleep the next morning to keep up. My head being always clouded by the smoke, I couldn't think straight and turn the situation around for many months. Still today I'm week from bad eating and bad exercising.

At the start of 2020, I did my usual retrospective of the year and I couldn't be more sad at myself.  Obviously, the end of the year was WAY worse than the start of it.  And now, I had this terrible feeling that I had a dependance I couldn't get out of easily...

I knew that I couldn't quit Cold Turkey because of the habit of smoking a bong every hour while I was at work. So I decided that the best way to stop, was reducing until I could be able not to smoke for a whole month!

 I started by writing down the Time of each bong I was doing in a day. Then I would add every puff in a day and make a total. The next day, I would need to smoke at least a couple less toke, so on and so on. 

This week has been the worst so far. Where last week I did over a 75+ tokes, this week I'm ""only"" at 20 tokes, most of them were done Sunday and Monday! :) I must say that this week as been hell for me until now.  No appetite, bad sleep, loss of focus, sweeting, name it all... 

All until today, were I was able to spend 24hours completely sober! And up to now, today was my best day of the week no doubt! I wrote all this to remind me in the next few days and weeks that stopping was a hell of a nigthmare and that I should think about it twice next time I want to take a toke...

&#x200B;

PS: In order to get out of the bad loop, I ordered a Nutrition plan and a Training plan from a trainer to help me get back in shape!! :) I'm really excited to receive the plans and start to change the routine!!",15

I have been a heavy smoker since I was a senior in high school.  I smoked multiple times (at least 5 times) daily from age 18-33.  Last year, I decided it was time to cut back, as it really was making me paranoid and was just not enjoyable to me anymore.  For me, it just became a way to escape myself.  I still worked, went to school, etc. and did fine in those areas, albeit probably not as well as I could have done, but as soon as I got home, I was sparking up and sitting on the couch, numb to the world.  I am a homebody by nature, but the weed just made it so extreme.  If I could sit at home for 5 days in a row smoking, I would.  I was also diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and realize in retrospect that I was probably self-medicating for a good chunk of those 15 years.

Anyway, as I said, I made the decision to cut back last year, but now I'm realizing it would just be better for me to be completely sober.  Since I've ""cut back,"" I went from smoking multiple times daily to smoking about once or twice a week at social gatherings with friends.  For context, I used to drink but quit alcohol over a year ago.  My friends still all drink, and when I'm out with them, I have a really hard time not smoking, especially when everyone is getting pretty drunk.  I think there's something about being 100% sober in these environments that is still terrifying to me.  I also have some friends who I'm really close to, but when we get together, smoking is just kind of what we do.  These are some of my best friends (our relationships are not based on substances at all, and not all of these people are stoners, either), so I don't really want to lessen my time with them.

  The last few times I've consumed THC, it has just resulted in extreme anxiety (which seemed to amplify even more after the high wore off).  I've had two panic attacks in the last 3 weeks, and I literally have never had one before in my life, so I'm recognizing the importance of putting the ganja down for good.  I guess I'm just looking for a little advice on how best to handle social situations.  When I'm home alone, I really don't feel an urge to smoke and pretty much haven't by myself since I decided to decrease.  Any advice on how to reconfigure my approach in group settings would be much appreciated!  Thank you!

tl;dr: I cut back on weed but I want to be completely sober and am looking for advice on how to handle social situations.",2

I've been wanting to quit more and more lately. I have smoked for about 11 years since I was 19, and it's time for a change.

I don't really enjoy smoking anymore, and it's been causing me more harm than good lately, I just hate the lack of appetite, and the night sweats, but the insomnia makes me feel crazy. 

I also take  0.25mg clonazapam for anxiety issues daily, but I suspect the root cause of my anxiety in the first place, is my smoking habit. 

This morning I took a few puffs from my bubbler, and coughed up some phlem with brown specks in it, which was really alarming to me. I was sick twice (once before, and once after Christmas) lately, so not sure if that could have anything to do with it. 

My contract at my previous employer ended just before Christmas, so now is the time I think I should go ahead and cut back, then quit (So the withdrawals don't cause me to freak out, which could have severe social consequences). 

Sorry for the long post, I'm just freaked out, and anxious. I don't want to be this way anymore. :(",3

Today has been good! I'm still waking up feeling a little rough but it's improving a little every day.  I went to the gym around midday and afterwards I had one of my most productive afternoons in a long time. Today has been the first day since quitting that I haven't felt anxious and sad... in fact I felt pretty damn good! I've had a bit of a low level headache but nothing a couple of painkillers couldn't take care of. I think smoking too many cigarettes is adding to my headaches. My appetite is back. I devoured a plate of steak and fries and didn't feel any stomach pains or nausea after. All in all, it's been a great day... even got a bit of January sunshine... a rare sight in these parts. I really hope I'm turning a corner with this.

On a side note, last night I went to bed and listened to Led Zeppelin III with my headphones on. It took be back to being 14-15yrs old and doing the same thing. It was a bittersweet experience.... thinking back to being a teenager, at a time just before I discovered weed, no problems, no addictions, just enjoying life. For some reason it filled me with motivation to keep going... thinking of a simpler time without all the bs that comes with a weed addiction.

Maybe weed doesn't have a place in my life anymore.","So, after being a fairly heavy user for the past 8ish years, with only tiny breaks here and there, I decided to start the new year right by taking the entire month of January off to sort of reset my brain and tolerance. I definitely got to the point where weed wasn't even enjoyable anymore, and I was just using it to stay in a haze and avoid my life problems. Not a good place to be.

Nothing against the good people over at r/petioles, I've been mainly posting there because I had every intention of coming back to cannabis use after my month break, and hopefully use in careful moderation. Long story short, I've broken my t-break twice this month. Once last Saturday with an edible, and once last night after breaking down and buying a vape pod.

The thing I noticed, though, is that neither of those times were all that enjoyable, at least not as much as I thought it would be. The edible last Saturday was because I was just feeling really depressed and bored, and needed a pick me up. It ended up not hitting me that hard at all, and I ended up just feeling a heavy blah feeling. Like it amplified my boredom, and took away any energy I had to actually do something about the boredom.

I threw away the edible on Monday and started my week fresh again... until last night, when I had an extremely bad stomach ache, probably from a heavy burrito I had for lunch. Stupid me convinced myself that the only way to get rid of this stomach ache was to go pick up a vape pod. By the time I got back, my stomach ache was mostly gone, but I vaped anyway, and surprise surprise... didn't enjoy it at all. Made me feel immediately just... dumb and out of it. Head felt really tight. Felt like I didn't sleep great, and now in the morning I have a headache and tight feeling in my ear and jaw.

The tricky part for me is I've received medicinal benefits from the plant in the past. I do have stomach issues, and weed was great at masking them and making my life bearable. At a time, weed helped with my depression and anxiety. Now it just seems to amplify it. Weed use to give me a wonderful night's sleep. Now I wake up feeling groggy and out of it every morning. I'm still having a hard time accepting this, which is why I convince myself that I ""need"" it still.

Anyway, even though I'm technically back to day 1, a better way of looking at it is that I've been sober for 13 out of the 15 days in January so far, and for me that's progress. Yeah I broke my streak, but I'm still doing better than I ever have in the past several years.

TL;DR - Trying to quit, slipped up twice and didn't enjoy either time. Having a hard time convincing myself that I don't need to use it as ""medicine"" because the negatives seem to always outway the benefits. I'm realizing the weed maybe doesn't have a place in my life anymore.",6

I drank occasionally as in maybe once every few months but I literally never touched weed until 23. I was introduced to weed by a very attractive girl at my school in university, and instantly fell in love with it. I was on the school basketball team and also in full time studies at one of the top schools in the country. Weed took all my stress away and was my escape from reality. The fact that this hot girl was giving it to me for free in her dorm room didn’t help either. She was a rich international student and didn’t really care for grades or studying as she knew her parents would pay for her to retake any classes she failed. I on the other hand come from a middle class background and did not have this luxury. Long story short spend all my time with this girl and weed and didn’t study, it wasn’t long before my grades dropped and I had to leave the school because I didn’t get into my selected program. Lost contact with the girl but kept smoking and vaping on my own. Met a new girl and fell in love, kept smoking throughout the relationship. Things went well for about a year and a half but eventually started smoking way to much and was high all the time. I chose getting high over going on dates and doing fun things. Spend too much on weed, and ended up fighting with my girl over nonsense a lot. Tried to quit multiple times and the longest streak I had was 30 days exact and then I relapsed hard. Weed also made porn much more appealing which was something I try to avoid. My girlfriend of two years recently left me causing me to have a mental breakdown and quit my shit minimum wage job. Using weed and porn to cope but I know that it’s time to seriously get rid of them both and start my life fresh. Throwing out my weed as I write this and I will be focusing on self development from now on. Still in contact with my ex and said that if I get clean she might be willing to give it another shot. Either way I will not be bringing weed or porn into my next relationship and I will not be keeping them in my life if I am single. Wish me luck everyone!

Day 8 was still by far the worst and it's slowly gotten better since then. The past couple of days have had me feeling the most ""normal"" since quitting, however I'm still experiencing stints of anxiety and dread, for no apparent reason. I've had a good/stress-free morning, yet for 20/30 mins I had an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and dread (which has now passed) but it's happening a few times a day still.

Has anybody else experienced this, this far on after quitting, and how do you find works best for dealing with it? I understand that everybody takes a different amount of time to feel ""better"" from the withdrawal symptoms and I've honestly had no cravings to go back to smoking; I'm just finding it very draining trying to battle these periods of gloom.

Sleep has also been a lot better, although the vivid dreams are still there. The first two weeks were constant nightmares, whereas now they're just strange/random. Last night was the first dream I had about using, but I didn't smoke.. I was given an edible in the form of a tic-tac sweet (I've never been an edible user, always a toker) and I took it, felt crazy high instantly and then woke up in a panic.

I am 5 or 6 days in, cant really say since I was basically forced to quit due to weed induced panic attacks that didnt go away, even after (stupididly) changing to indica and only smoking like 3 hits a day (compared to 3-5 big joints). I smoked tobacco joints so I felt the physical withdrawal of nicotine and the psychological ones of weed. 

The worst thing I had and still have to deal with is my anxiety. It is almost unbearable and basically there 24/7. I could barely handle it the last few days but I feel like it is starting to get better and I am feeling a bit better in general which is awesome. 

Something I am noticing now is: I kind of have this ""nostalgic feeling"". Not nostalgic in terms of I think of the past and miss it, even though of course I do in terms of my smoking rituals that made me feel really good. I am talking more about a feeling that is like being put back into when I was 14 and weed wasnt a topic in my life at all. I cant really explain it, it seems like a mixture of anxiety and excitement for life. I really wish I could find better words for it and I also checked this sub for something similar but couldnt find anything. Does anyone feel like they are experiencing something similar?",67

Been a daily smoker for 10 years. Heavy in uni, bit less when I started working (evenings and weekends). Couple years ago I quit for a couple months, found withdrawal very difficult due to the negative emotions. Here lately I’ve been waking and baking and just pretty much never being sober. Work has been fine, but I knew my use was just out of control. 

I have used weed to cope with adhd, trauma and a sleep disorder (sleep paralysis) for years. Last week my boyfriend quit smoking cigarettes. I decided to quit weed with him in solidarity. He grew up in a family of chain smokers and his father died of lung cancer. So he had a lot of emotions tied into it. He was smart and brave and went to the doctor and enrolled in a stop smoking program. 

My impulsive ass decided to quit with him (even though it’s always been a goal of mine for this year). But initially I thought I’d vape weed until he was over the worst of The nicotine withdrawals, so I could be supportive of him, as I knew I’d be an emotional wreck. However, I was so inspired by him, I decided to just bite the bullet and go for it. First 5 days were surprisingly easy. I had a bit of sleep trouble and some irritation and appetite loss, but nothing too bad. It was hard dealing with his irritation and emotions but I was managing and proud of myself for supporting him. 

Day 7 I completely lost my shit. Had a giant meltdown over the dumbest shit. Legit some herbs I wanted to cook with had gone bad and my crazy ass acted like it was the end of the world. I just totally cracked. For the past 2 days I have been an emotional wreck. 

Yesterday I couldn’t go to work. I couldn’t do anything but sit frozen and cry. Finally I got up the nerve to call the doctors office. The assistant was so sweet. She could tell I was in a bad way and got me through on a phone consultation. 

The doctor prescribed me some medicine to help me calm down and cope in the short term, and we made a follow up appointment for when I come back from my work trip. 

It was a really big deal for me. I am always the strong capable person. Always the achiever. Weed never dampened my motivation. It just helped me cope with negative emotions so they wouldn’t get in my way. I didn’t need to ask for help because I had my weed. 

I made it to the top of my career and became the go to person for all those around me; I became a beacon of strength partly because weed was my armor. I couldn’t be hurt because I couldn’t feel. 

Now I’m 32 and I am really happy with what I have achieved in life, but I know it’s time to say goodbye to the little plant that helped me so much. I want to be free from my crutch. 

It’s been so hard to ask for help, it’s been very confronting to be weak and need to call a doctor. But I’m very glad I did. 

Day 9 now. One step at a time. Hang in there folks",33

Stay sober guys, life is worth it, when you smoke or drink, you are numbing your feelings, but you can’t selectively numb just the bad ones, you numb the good ones too.  Come out and work through the pain and uncomfortableness because the reward of actually being able to fully feel joy, bliss, pride and a sense of accomplishment is worth it.

Usually only takes an hour or so to drift off that way. If I don't read then those thoughts will come into my head relentlessly. My main issue now is the inevitable lucid dreams. Fuck they get rough at times, especially because I was able to lucid dream and it happened often when I was a kid before I ever smoked anything. Now they're just at a whole other level, where I start lucid dreaming but last night in particular I dreamt that I woke up in my room not long after drifting off and a lot of weird shit went down that I don't want to elaborate on. It happened twice over 3 hours. Was really fucked up like it was like my own brain was trying to trick me into believing I was truly awake when before I could never be fooled and could always tell I was in the dream.

So random too they dont come in order im just baffled its not like anything is reminding me of these certain moments. My brain is just throwing them at me.  Some are significant moments.. maybe they were important and my brain is trying to remind me of my lessons now im sober and can actually learn from them and not forget.  For example ive been thinking about my old friends some i smoked a lot with and im seeing moments where they treated me poorly and were shitty friends.

Today was the worst though. 2.5 weeks in is when the depression and negativity really start to peak, I've been shown, and today was proof of that.

I woke up, couldn't find my car keys, was having a huge breakdown internally over it. I eventually found them and left for work, but the sense of impending doom was so strong I turned around and went home. I usually play my piano to calm me down but it felt like torture. After laying on the couch like a vegetable I decided to help my mom get my dog to his vet appointment, and once that happened I was able to try going into work, three hours late.

I turned to nicotine to help ease me, but it doesn't really help. Of course. My best friend says I'm already under a lot of stress (my mom is slowly dying) and I should just go back to having some weed instead of suffering additionally. I know when I do I won't be able to control myself though.

Wanted to vent that, my case may be atypical because of life events but up til today I've been handling it okay. I hope things start to subside soon on the withdrawl side because this shit is NOT easy.

Since my post about quitting, nothing much has changed. If it has, it's been for the worse. I'm still struggling in the same boat as the rest of you. I never thought i'd let something like this control my life. Truthfully, this is something I thought i'd grow out of. Let me give you all a quick hindsight of what i'm going through. Any advice will be greatly appreciated as I don't have much support.

First, I started smoking when I was about 15 (Currently 23). Ever since, I've only taken a long break once due to legal issues. This break was for about one year, and I was in the best shape of my life, Focused, I just felt great in general. As of right now, I'm depressed, broke, and jobless. Just lost my job, so I decided this would be the best time to quit as I don't have the extra cash for dabs at the moment, but I know what the withdrawal Symptoms are like. For those who say it's only psychological, I disagree. Every attempt at quitting I've been nauseous (to the point where I've thrown up) this does go away, but past few times it's been the worst I've experienced. I have no appetite. Can't sleep if I do my dreams are INSANE. Does anyone else experience this? How do I not feel so irritated when I quit? What made you guys decide to quit?

This was until I started to see that throughout my day I was an emotionless monotone husk and I just couldnt wait to go home and get stoned for the night, then wake up and repeat the cycle.

 Weed isnt even fun for me anymore it just feels like something I was supposed to do. I made a habit of setting a time when I would take the oil and had a decent idea on when it would kick in. There would be times where I'm doing something and not even thinking about getting high until I see the clock and realize it was time to do my habit.

Right now I'm anxious and wandering around my house nearly convincing myself that I can just go out and buy some more oil because quitting isnt for me anyway.

Whether tis nobler to inhale the intoxication held within the white cloud and experience the sweet relief for a night... Or to resist the helpless temptation which has yet to provide me a true balance within. Smoke, and my heart will be full of disappointing shame, only to feel better for a few short hours. But will I really feel better? This feeling in me now is that of a thousand great swords balancing on the edge, never will they topple, yet I cannot help but fear my impending doom. This feeling and I have known eachother for centuries it seems. I smoke because it is there and it is there because I smoke. Is this simply boredom bursting through years of suffocation? Is it my natural defenses built up from escaping my reality so long? Is it the compilation of my subconscious emotions, restricted or clouded from 43,680 consecutive sessions of smoke? These answers I cannot confirm, yet one thing is for certain. If I let this feeling take me there is no going back. It will bind me in the dark isolation surrounded by the illusion of content. I could be ""content"" all my life, but I would be many parts of a fractured whole. No matter how hard I tried, a piece would always be missing. This piece is what drives me. This piece is what strives me. This piece is what derives me, from something greater than myself. This piece is the conquest of my life's greatest ambition. This piece is not the last one missing from a great puzzle, it is the first, beginning to form a new vision. This vision has TRULY always been a part of me, even before that feeling took hold. This vision aches too be created, yearns for it's own existence. Each step I take away from it holds my head heavy. And each step I take in light of my quest surrounds me with a similar, yet completely different feeling. In place of anxiety comes excitement. The only difference is this: with anxiety my fear consumes me, with excitement I consume the fear. And even now, I can feel it transforming. And with this pen I bleed my fear onto this page, for now I consume. But not the white cloud, I replace that with here and now.",15

The 22nd of November is the day i stopped smoking weed. Or well, my doctor told me to stop smoking weed. its the day i went to see my doctor because i've been having severe panic attacks. Within a week i experienced 4 heavy anxiety/panic attacks. One happened at a friends house, Two happened at home and one happened in the car (i wasnt driving) on my way to the doctor's appointment . 

Ive been dealing with anxiety since middle school. And smoked weed thinking it would help me overcome my anxiety. Which it did, in the short run. In the long run my anxiety worsened which i found out many years later. Ive smoked weed for at least 5 years (just turned 21). So all that stress that i build up all those years. And feeling of guilt i suppressed smoking weed came to an explosion and scared the living shit out of me. Idk if you ever experienced a panic attack and maybe its different for everyone. But to me it felt like having a heart attack, which was my initial thought also (completely unrealistic but i never had a panic attack so i didn't know what was happening to me)

Its been almost 2 months since i last smoked weed and i feel a lot better. More positive, more energetic, less brain fog and my home situation is much and much better. People around me respond positive as well to my quitting. And of course, all the stories and experiences i read on r/leaves was a big motivation booster for me to quit the devils lettuce. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this.

2020-01-15 12:11:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ep5271/a_beginners_guide_to_controlling_anxiety/,A beginners guide to controlling anxiety," 

When you first start thinking about quitting, anxiety starts to really show itself. The idea of not having any pot, not smoking can be overwhelming before you even make the decision. However for many of us once you've quit, that same anxiety starts to set in but related to your daily life and not just weed. If anyone is in the same boat, know that while it's biological you can control it, and you can make a difference in how you feel. However know that everyone is different, and what worked for some may not work for you. The first step is to try.

I got through some pretty severe anxiety when I quit last spring. I saw a therapist for an extended period of time. At first I thought the classic ""I don't need therapy"", but looking back it was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time. If you have the means to do so, I would highly encourage it. I will try to summarize what I took from these sessions, and the things that continue to work for me moving forward. I apologize, as it's a little long winded. 

* First recognize that many people who have never smoked deal with anxiety. For me, smoking too much weed was enhancing the underlying anxiety issues I already had, while at the same time allowing me to numb it/cope. When you quit, your coping mechanism (substance) for this underlying anxiety is gone and suddenly these issues come back to the surface. So working on your anxiety will likely be helpful moving forward even once you feel much better a few months out.
* Anxiety is not your body's response to something. It is your body's ***anticipation*** of something. You are worried about something, regardless if you consciously realize this. The great thing is that you've already proven you're aware that you're experiencing anxiety. So when you feel that anxiety (or an anxiety attack) try to take a few minutes to yourself and ask the following.
* Like really, take a few minutes. **Stop what you're doing. SERIOUSLY. Stop. Don't leave it in the background.** Say these things out loud if you have to:
   * What is worrying me right now? Is there a recurring though in your head that you can't shake? Did something that just happened provoke a response? (Eg. when I quit, I had crazy thoughts that my marriage was going to end, and it worried me constantly)
   * Why is this worrying me? Did you have a past experience that makes you anticipate something happening again? Is it because you feel guilty about something? (I felt guilty that I had been absent from my marriage for a few years, as I was high constantly, which made me feel like I had failed my wife and that she would come to realize that I wasn't enough)
   * Most importantly for me was What is the quality of my information? In other words, is this a rational thought? Do I have reason to believe this? (My wife had never mentioned anything to me. Never commented on my smoking. Never seemed unhappy. Was extremely supportive in every way.). Often once you ""assess"" the quality of information, you might just realize that whatever is bothering you is bothering you for no reason at all.
   * Take action. If you've identified that it's a relationship/human issue, talk to that person. (I opened up about exactly how I felt with my wife, and it was quickly realized that she had no such feelings toward me. I immediately felt better , and could move past the issue.). Are you avoiding something, like an important phone call, or task at work and you're worried about the repercussions? Do that thing! It's harder than it sounds, but it's an instant cure and the relief/satisfaction you'll feel of overcoming that thing will give you power moving forward.
* On that final note, know that overcoming these feelings will make it easier next time. Avoiding phone calls? The more you answer them, the easier answering them the next time will be. Avoiding going out with friends? Each time you go out, it will be easier to do the next time. Avoiding completing tasks at home? You might be surprised how much it snowballs into a productive lifestyle after you start doing a few things.
* Talk to someone. For the love of all things good, talk to someone. Family, significant other, coworker or this Subreddit, talk about it. You will feel better , and you'll realize you're not alone.

There are plenty other techniques like breathing exercises, yoga, meditation etc. that work wonders with these things.  Know that you are in control and you can actively make a difference with your anxiety.  But you have to make an effort. While it may subside on it's own for some, know that you can intervene and make a difference.

Would love to hear others stories/techniques, and make a nice repository for some helpful tools moving forward. Good luck everyone, I appreciate everything this thread and it's contributors have done for me.",12

2020-01-15 09:56:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ep3b9l/day_15_promises_to_myself/,Day 15 - Promises to myself,"Hey all, as always just writing down thoughts on my situation. I've been a regular smoker for the last 22 years

I'm 39 years old and I've decided that I need to give myself a birthday present of good physical and mental health for my 40th later this year. Therefore I've made some promises to myself. I'm not sure if this is off topic, but just wanted to write it down somewhere. They're pretty personal to me so maybe it's not that interesting for others. Anyway, here we go....

1. No more weed ever. No explanation needed really
2. Better physical health. I've started going to the gym. Light exercise is all I can handle right now but I hope to increase my stamina over time... which leads on to...
3. Quit smoking cigarettes. This is arguably gonna be harder than quitting weed. I can't imagine doing both at the same time but hopefully in the coming months. Right now I'm smoking like a chimney
4. Stay away from things that I know will annoy me. I've already started to steer clear of newspapers / news sites / opinion pieces / social media. A little is ok I guess, but I spend too much time with my head stuck in my phone getting annoyed about some pointless bs
5. Spend more time with my girlfriend. I tend to isolate myself when I'm high and become very uncommunicative
6. Have a better relationship with my parents. Smoking has made me distance myself from them a little. They're getting old and won't be around for ever. They gave me an amazing and secure childhood and I should be more grateful for that
7. Become more productive in my work. I'm self employed and, if I'm honest, I do the minimum just to put food on the table and pay rent. I'm a lazy idiot who would rather smoke than earn money. Doing this has put me in a very precarious situation financially and it's scaring me quite a lot right now. This leads on to...
8. Educate myself further in my field of work. There is always more to learn. Also I need to be more organized and business minded. This is something I'm terrible with.
9. Distance myself from negative people. This doesn't necessarily mean people who smoke. There are too many people I know that spend their life complaining. To be fair, I've been one of the people so I'm not judging. I know I've exhausted some of best friends with my constant negativity / feeling sorry for myself. This leads to...
10. I need to 'let things go' more. I tend to dwell and obsess about things that don't go my way / things that are out of my control. Life is unfair.
11. Stop acting like a teenager. If I'm honest, I never truly 'grew up'. I'm embarrassed to admit I can act like a stroppy teenager at times. I'm nearly 40 ffs. If I met me, would I like me? Probably not.
12. Try and be more sociable. I tend to shy away from social occasions. If I'm going for a meal, party, gathering etc in the evening I'll still smoke all day, get paranoid, turn up red eyed and looking like hell and then not really wanna speak to anyone other than my closest friends.
13. I want to read more. I love reading but I've always found it hard to concentrate while high. Also I'd forget what I'd read as soon as I'd put the book down. Just finished reading my first book in about 5 years... and can still remember the plot!
14. Stay away from porn. When I was younger it was the most exciting thing ever. Now it's just 'meh'. I've normalized it too much. That can't be a good thing
15. Keep in mind that life is a gift. We get one go at this and I've been wasting it.

Wow, that got me kind of emotional. It definitely felt good to write it down. 2020 here I come

Thanks to everyone in this community. Your positivity and support has helped me get through this. I couldn't have done this without you. Stay blessed :)",27

I've been a regular smoker for almost 6 years of my life (3-4 times a day would be a generous average I'd say, sometimes it was waaay more, sometimes less). I've found it hard to give up, as I have a very addictive personality. Last year during December I'd had enough of the constant anxiety, the feeling of losing control over my life and ""it"" influencing every decision I made in some form or the other and started off small by just quitting personal J's. I have been on many ""breaks"" before and know that it's a gradual process of weening off it rather than trying it cold turkey. 

I reduced my consumption to about 1-2 joints a day, mostly with friends and people I actually enjoyed smoking up with. But even then I didn't enjoy being high anymore. Every time I was sober I used to have this romanticized idea of getting high and things getting better, but none of that shit was true, and it hadn't been for over 3 years. Yet, somehow I still convinced myself to get high. Only because I didn't know any different. The power of fooling yourself can be strong. 

Then came new year's, I'd already told most of my friends that I would be taking a ""break"" as I'd learnt from this community that telling your friends about something you're going to do makes you less likely not to follow through with it. Saying the word ""quit"" gave me anxiety (I still had a soft spot for marijuana after all, as I'm sure most of y'all here do). The morning after a night of heavy drinking (and heavy smoking) I woke up and there was this feeling, very similar to when I quit cigarettes during my 2018 new year's resolution (2 years going strong! Turkey is best served cold) and just knew I wouldn't hit that tempting devil's lettuce. 

I felt confident in my ability to ween off it after a really long time. Maybe what I'm trying to say is the feeling has to come from within to truly follow through with it. Anyway about 10 days in I was chilling with my stoner friends (actually 80% of my friends are stoner friends if not more) and I was very drunk and they had these good ass dabs that looked really enticing so I took a very small hit. I blasted off! I felt so good, the clean high, no anxiety nothing! But I also knew in that moment it was not something I'd want to do again. Ever since that day I've been offered many joints/dabs/what have you and declined all of them. I feel really proud of the progress I am making. What I'm trying to say is, people falter. It's what you do after that makes the difference. 

A past version of me would have given up his dreams of quitting as soon as that dab entered my system and gotten back on the road to self pity and helplessness, but the present me had the level headedness to understand, no, it does not matter that I took this hit. It matters what I do after it. It's been a great couple of weeks and I wish everyone in this community who's still looking for some motivation to find it within. Really question yourself, is it worth it anymore?",9

First - Thank you all for your vulnerability and honesty within this forum and community. It's refreshing and encouraging to hear others having similar feeling and experiences. 

I (28 F) have been smoking cannabis since I was 19, and basically daily since I was 22. My now fiance was my dealer in college, I've worked in the medical and recreational industry in 2 states (I moved to try and continue my career), met some of my closest friends in industry, and have a deep respect for how this plant can aid in the lives of many. It has just taken me a while to understand I am not one of those people. 

Ive been playing around with the idea of stepping back and taking a break to reevaluate cannabis' role in my routines and life for a while, but for so long felt like my life and relationships were so entwined I would lose some part of myself. Then, feeling guilty (?), end up convincing myself my habit is not a problem as I hit the bong.

Ive taken small breaks before, but generally around events (vacation, study abroad, etc.) and haven't had withdrawal trouble beyond sleeping in these scenarios, so I never considered myself addicted. 

I had a sudden neurological episode a week or so ago (save that for another post) and have since been sober 6 days.
It feels different this time, like I'm ready to actually follow through and stop convincing myself that its medicinal and natural characteristics negate the negativity and quiet malice it has inflicted on my life. 

Thanks for listening - appreciate you",13

Finding myself feeling better physically, more alert, more active, dreams have come back, and dang are they vivid and full.

Appetite has come back, eating better, that's good.

I don't miss being high as much as I miss that detachment from the nothingness that is my life, lol, having mental illness and being unemployed for like 10 years, and being on the pension for about 8 and a half years makes me somewhat unemployable, which sucks, and there are not a lot of jobs going where I am.

2020-01-14 23:32:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eoxg6t/im_back_where_i_started/,I’m back where I started.,"Last April, I (25M) took what would be my final hit from my bong for six months. I walked away cold turkey. I was tired of living my life on autopilot. Over those six months I got in shape. Traveled. Met a boy. Broke up. Took a new job in a new city. I experienced life with a clear head, and I can’t say that I really missed getting high. 

In fact, I think the only thing I missed about it was the social element and the ritual of it all. Maybe listening to music, too.

October rolled around and I was feeling in control. I’d read posts here of people smoking again after six months and just falling back in, and I’d say that would never be me. I thought I’d hit a reset button on my addictive personality. 

A music festival was in my city, and my good friend from college came to visit me. He’s a very high-functioning stoner. I told myself I’d give myself permission to smoke if he brought some. My hard rule then was that I would never buy any for myself or have any on me. That felt safe. 

Getting high with my friend after six months wasn’t anything monumental. I remember taking the first few hits and feeling like I was visiting an old friend. Then, I just felt slow and impaired. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t great.

A couple weeks went by and I went to my older brother’s place. He had a pen and I hit it, following my rule to never have any on me. Maybe another week went by, and I wanted to smoke again. So, I found some in my new city. Just a little. Just to get reacquainted. The scariest part was how that feeling of falling back into it and chasing the high felt almost good. Comfortable. Comforting. I slipped back into the autopilot. My old habits. My lack of motivation. Getting high before work. I felt my anxiety coming back and my mood wasn’t stable anymore. 

The thing I hated most was how I’d just leave all my paraphernalia and such out because it’s all I would do. I’m living in a new city on my own for the first time, and I’ve put so much time and money into making my apartment look and feel like me. And there’s been a shit ton of weed, pipes, and my gravity bong just sitting on my kitchen island for months. Just like it did for years on the nightstand in my room in my last city. 

I took some home for the holidays to my parents’. I’d smoke any time I could get away. I’d drive to my old high school just to toke up and go back home. It just became so much easier to be numb again. I feel like shit about myself. I haven’t been to the gym in months. And I don’t know why, but this second time around it’s been so hard just to quit cold turkey again and jump into the things that make me better. 

But tonight I’m falling asleep sober for the first time in months. I cleaned my whole apartment, dismantled the bong and put everything away. I’m ready to do the work again. I want to start taking care of myself again. I want a life I don’t want to numb, and that includes all of the good and all of the bad. 

So here’s to day 1, again.",7

I'm 41yo, functional smoker, and have been a regular user of flower since I was 11 years old. Yes, I've been an addict my entire life and it's really hard to say that. 

As kids, we were abandoned by our mother for about 5 years. I was 8 when she started leaving, and over time she just stopped coming home for weeks on end. She met a guy at work after such a horribly violent and abusive marriage and then divorce. I think she just kind of broke down and needed to be loved. 

In her absence, I started super young, going out at night even school nights, to go skate and smoke with my sister. I  didn't know back then that I wasn't giving myself the opportunity to allow my mind develop healthy coping mechanisms. I didn't know that's what happens in your teens!

I did the only thing I knew how to: numb myself so I didnt feel the hurt. I also did LSD for the first time when I was 11. And now as an adult, I realize that its COMPLETELY INSANE. I fell into alcoholism as well, but I've been dry since the 4th of July. That was the biggest battle to fight, but I'm seeing now that my weed habit isn't doing anything positive for me, and so I am facing this with honesty, and now recognize that the battle of addiction isn't really over for me. 

I never smoke before/during work, but like many others here, it was the first thing I did as soon as I got home. My method was bong rips, so I could pretend like I wasn't damaging my lungs THAT bad. But to be honest, I know my lungs need to heal. I developed asthma when I was 40. How strange. I can't attribute it to anything else besides marijuana usage, and now it is something I have to manage daily. 

I am terrified. I've been using for nearly my ENTIRE LIFE. And I don't know what this is going to be like for me. Today, it seems like a part of my mind got unlocked. Some things that happened when I was little are coming back and it its ripping my heart to pieces to know it. Suddenly TODAY, to have these new memories that I don't want. I'm really scared about this. I'm going to be facing so much...and I also need  to be learning ways to cope without weed. I've been coping with substances my whole life. Time to stop. All that time...all that life, just gone. 

But I know I can't look back. This ends now. I cried just now as I was telling my dog that I ALREADY quit!! Yeh, possibly experiencing mood swings as I detox. My brains like WTF man. Today is my fourth day completely sober. The first 2 days were brutal, but yesterday it was easier and I didnt even think about it! And now today, actively seeking tools to help me kick this addictions ASS.

TLDR: I've been smoking weed for 30 years, started when I was 11, coming from abandonment and then her alcoholism after my mom came back. I never developed healthy coping mechanisms since I started so young. I quit drinking 4th of July last year, that addiction was hard to kick, but now I realize I still have an addiction and so this is my 4th day sober. Crazy memories are starting to come back and its very scary to face this with total honesty.",6

I stopped for a while in 2018, but last year I started using a vape pen. I would just do small hits but it was pretty much daily. 

A few months ago I had a day to myself so I smoked in the morning. I think it was two small bowls. Shortly afterwards I got an overwhelming feeling of anxiety. I felt like I couldn't catch my breath and worried I was going to just fall over dead. I paced around my home and was even hovering over calling 911. It was scary. I calmed down after an hour. 

I stopped for a day or so and cut back on the amount. But I had another experience like that recently where I just felt super anxious. In all my years of smoking I never had that feeling.

I think I just need a break. I don't know how it became a daily thing for me. I am successful, I have a good home life and am very happy. I think I have abused my brain and body chemistry for too long. I need to reset my body's chemistry. I can't say at this point I'll never do it again, but I know I need to give it up for a while and never go back to daily use.

So I started smoking out of boredom / curiosity. I don't have any traumas or a rough childhood or any of that stuff some people had. My life so far has been pretty normal I guess. 
Although I've always dealt with depression from young age, and anxiety starting my 20s.

I started smoking joints, like one per day at night.
It felt great. After a day of work, just go to my roomates and smoke a joint or two, listening to music, playing video games. The usual stuff.
As the time goes on, I increased my intake for two joints per night, then two and a half, then I bought a bong, then I was using a gravity bong.
By the end of the last year I was smoking like an ounce every month, if not more.

My routine changed. It was wake up, smoke, get munchies and eat, smoke, play video games, too tired to go to the gym, smoke, watch TV, smoke and go to sleep.
I gained a lot of weight, my house was filthy as fuck becouse I was too tired or stoned to do anything.
All my money went to buy weed and order junk food. Sometimes beer.

My motivation for finding a decent job, study to improve in my career or work out was demolished every time I smoked.
I felt in the worst depression I've ever been. My anxiety goes to the roof everytime I think about all the stuff I must do and can't becouse of my lack of motivation. I've been feeling like a loser and a pathetic being that is surely disappointing his parents.

I'm so fucking done with this. I must regain control of myself, my life. I'm done with the numbness, the brain fog, being tired all the time, having bad memory. 

This day I'm quitting weed.",4

I’ve quite weed.  Been off for about 4 weeks, where I used to smoke daily.  I could go into how many times I’ve tried to quit before, and failed.  I could talk about how great I feel now, and I’m glad I’ve come to where I am.  However, I came here today to talk about productivity and dreams.

I’m a writer, and when I smoke I can’t write.  It’s almost mentally painful to do so.  That’s not everyone’s experience, but it is mine.  When I don’t write I kinda get depressed.  So having not written very much over the last 3 years, due to heavy weed use, I had sunk pretty damn low.  Lately I’ve been writing again, which has really helped.  But I’ve been grasping for ideas and a bit blocked.  Tends to happen when you’re out of practice.

Tonight, something interesting happened that I wanted to share with y’all.  As you know, when you smoke daily, and especially before bed, your dreams go away.  When you stop, you get these crazy wild dreams, as if you have pent up dreams coming out.

Well, as a writer, I had massively devalued having dreams at night.  I just woke up in the middle of a nightmare - quickly wrote down the details of what I remembered.  And man let me tell you - I came away with not one, not two, but five absolutely solid story ideas.

This is game changing.  First of all, I’m keeping a journal by the side of the bed at all times now that I’ve quit.  And secondly I’ve got just one more reason to stay away from weed as a writer - these valuable dreams.

Lastly, an interesting note.  Smoked weed during the dream.  Legitimately felt very high.  When I woke up I returned to my fully sober self.  This one being a nightmare, wasn’t very nice, but this is not my first experience with that exact phenomenon.  It feels very real, but I feel stone sober now that I’m awake.  Can anyone else confirm something to that effect?",18

Back then I used to have dreams of smoking, more precisely they were nightmares, because I would wake up freaking out and thanking God that it was only a dream.

Now I haven't smoked since my last trip to Amsterdam last Monday. So I have been 8 days clean from weed. First 4 days were OK. Starting day 5 till now I have been feeling like hell, crying without tears, angry for no reason, full of hatred towards my family (The only people I love in this world), frequent headaches, inability to concentrate, tierdness, restlessness, insomnia, mood swings, feeling failure, guilt, and shame, fear of the future, fear of regretting the decisions I am taking now (like I want to cut ties with family), suicidal thoughts, loss of appetite.... I understand clearly now, why was I afraid of relapsing.

I know that there won't be no more relapses.

Cannabis disgusts me, the world with cannabis disgusts me, no more of this, I am over it I swear I am over cannabis I don't want it again. I am not fighting my urge to smoke, I am rather fighting my dirty mind to not think anything I would regret after calming down again.",8

So with that in mind I wanted to quit for good but even without mental health issues it’s still quite difficult.  As a motivator for quitting  I wanted to understand again what it was like to be sober and understand the positive emotional nuances in the experience of being sober, without the negative experience of withdrawal to color it.

I'm glad the app I use tracks both hours and time. The money is fairly low because my tolerance was always low compared to other people smoking every day. I actually used that as an excuse of why I don't have a problem, that in terms of the amount I was smoking, it really wasn't much compared to other people who were smoking everyday. I also always chose among the less expensive flower.

Even so, I was spending basically all my after-work hours so stoned that I rarely cleaned and never worked to better myself. No more knitting and cross stitching; keeping track of all those stitches was almost impossible for me while stoned. The movies I watched and the books I read/listened too are gone; none of it stuck in my long-term memory.

Having to deal with fibro flare-ups without numbing myself is shitty, but being stoned wasn't the best way to handle that anyway. Have to learn how to do it again, but goddamn now I have the time.",2

I’ve decided I need to stop smoking weed. I waited to try it until I was in college. My first two and half years I was a moderate user, definitely smoking a few times a week but almost always at night, after I had nothing to do and always socially. 

I’ve been an incredibly heavy user now for the past 2 years, smoking multiple times a day every single day. Up until about 6 months ago I was smoking from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. Smoking before morning classes. It made me paranoid and anxious and so I never talked to anyone in class or contributed in class or made any new friends. I never pushed myself to do any real work or make any real effort in doing anything. Waking up in the middle of the night due to insomnia and ripping my bong to try to fall asleep. The only reason I smoke less now is because I have a full time job I can’t be high at and I live at home with my parents. Instead, I take a ton of kratom during the day and just get high the moment I get off of work for the rest of the night. 

I don’t feel like a human. I have lost all aspects of me that made me interesting- I’ve given up all my hobbies and instead choose get high and forget the world around me. I have accomplished nothing that I am proud of. When I’m high I am so stupid. My thoughts make no sense and are infantile. I have always struggled with anxiety, and I used smoking as an excuse to feel better in this world, but I need to face the facts that it is making my life much worse. I have no drive to do anything. I have no social life outside of my boyfriend, and I’m honestly surprised he’s stuck around this long seeing as I feel like I’ve lost every good aspect of myself in the time that we’ve been dating. It doesn’t help that he smokes a lot of weed too but is still able to function as a person and he is still great and lovely, so I guess I convince myself that I can be that way too. However, I’ve complained to him so many times about feeling this way yet I do nothing about it so I’m afraid he thinks of this as a “boy who cried wolf” situation and maybe doesn’t take it seriously as I wish or else just feels like a therapist to me. Like I said, i don’t have a social life. 

I do think that I have an issue with depression maybe and definitely anxiety. I have been meditating on-and-off for the past few months, but have been better with it recently. I’m doing a lot more yoga now and practicing being more mindful. I’m trying to stop drinking as much caffeine and absolutely must stop the kratom right now as well. I want so bad to be healthier in every aspect. I’ve been reaching out to friends much more frequently, trying to rekindle old friendships. I can try harder to meet new people as well I guess. 

I’m sorry this post is all over the place. I guess I am just having a very hard time in life right now and I feel very alone. I just need some accountability and support in trying to be better. I’m afraid I won’t stop smoking just on my own, I already feel so alone and I never get anything done haha. 

I really, really appreciate anyone who reads this all the way through. It was long and rambling and not even very descriptive. But thank you :)",6

It started with quarter of an ounce a month but things escalated from there.

I started after my career had kicked off so it was easier to maintain a functioning pothead. However, I stopped doing the extra things I do.
I’m a proactive person. I like watching educational shows, documentaries, learn, learn, learn and do, do, do.

Over the years I’ve stopped setting new goals once old goals are accomplished. And everything started becoming a “next year” or “tomorrow” plan.

I stopped smoking Boxing Day. I was given 4 small joints (at my request, I didn’t want a quarter bag) and I was right. If it’s in my sight, I have no self control. The original plan was just “one that night and save the rest for fun occasions”. Just smoked one a day 4 days straight. I had an I clung that would happen. And it did. And in those 4 days I woke up sleepy, I didn’t read and just watched mindless sitcoms. 

Look, it’s fun and I like it but it’s stopping me from being me too much. I don’t consider it relapsing. I do want to smoke again, perhaps in 4-6months time but just buying a small amount, but I have to take this long long break to be me again. I want to be me again.",32

11 years ago my brother passed away suddenly. I was 19 years old at the time, having just started my sophomore year of college. I quickly went from being the bubbly cheerleader type to being a complete stoner as I self medicated. I had no idea how to deal with grief and trauma. None of my friends had gone through anything like this, so I felt extremely alone. It didn’t help that my school had a huge weed culture, and I almost failed out of school several times. 

When I quit for the first time back then, I had to deal with all the suppressed emotions which came flooding back.  I got professional help from a therapist, who helped me to accept my grief and guilt. I graduated with a horrible GPA but made it through nonetheless.

After about four years of being cannabis-free I thought it would be okay to smoke socially. At first it seemed to totally fine and it felt under control. When it became legal in my state, things got worse and I got hooked on weed candies during a bout of depression. I was still functioning well so I continued to justify it, but my anxiety and depression eventually got out of control as a result. 

Today it’s been a year since I’ve used marijuana and I did it with he help of a therapist again. I am happier and more creative. I just want to acknowledge that this is a lifelong affliction, and that you’re never safe just because you’ve stopped smoking for an extended amount of time. I wouldn’t have been able to quit again if it hadn’t been for this sub! Thank you! 

TLDR: Started chronically smoking during a period of grief and successfully quit. Thought it would be okay to start smoking socially again but it slowly spiraled out of control. Hoping to warn others.",224

Been lurking here for a couple days meow and Its time to introduce myself. Todays my first day not smoking bud. Ive been really thinking about my life alot lately and an injury at my job really has me wondering wtf my options are. Idk what I want to do for a living and I am 29 years old. Ive been content to be a cook and the money is not horrible but this injury really threw a wrench into that. I want to figure out who I am and what I want to do.



 I also am turning a huge corner next year by turning 30. I completely realize that my body is going to be changing and as I get older that the stoner lifestyle is not going to do me any good. I will be in shape during my 40s and 50s because I believe that exercise is something I can base my entire life and career around.  I see so many guys that are out of shape and unhappy and ill be damned if thats going to be me in 10 years. No way. 



My life is a clean slate and I can do anything I want from this point onward. I have a wonderful girlfriend whom I love very much. We have been together for one year and she is also a huge driving factor to make some positive changes in my life. Shes in nursing school getting straight As and just got her first job in the field and is doing really well. I look at her wins and gains and am thinking maybe its time for me to figure out what I want out of my life and go GET IT. 


I recently just quit Kratom after being on it heavily for over a year. Its been almost 2 months kratom free.  I was into heroin and opiates pretty horribly years before that and managed to turn my life around completely. I wasnt ready to quit smoking weed though. Im ready now though. I know what it takes to make new habits and I know quitting is going to be tough. Ive smoked daily since 13 years old. Im just hoping its all mental because If i can make it through heroin and kratom wothdrawl I can make it through stopping weed. 


  Just wanted to say Hi to everybody. I will be posting here from now on i think. When I quit kratom the subreddit for that helped me ALOT. Honestly it was better than meetings.  Ready to start this new journey and Im ready to have my wits about me again. Im ready to see what Im like when Im not stoned all the time. Its not going to be easy.

My field of vision was dark.  Everything was pissing me off. Yesterday, I began the day differently than normal: I did a ten minute meditation followed by a 20 minute run-walk. Trust me when I say I am NOT a runner, never was, probably never will be. I pretty much hated it the whole time. But I did it. I forced myself. I came back with a sweaty red face, took a shower, and proceeded to have the MOST PHENOMENAL DAY. I can’t remember the last time I felt that good. After our show I sat on the porch with my band mates as they smoked and passed the bowl around. One was obviously trying to keep the smoke from blowing toward me, and I smiled and said hey, no worries. He said “sorry, I don’t want to entice you” and I said “it’s all good, I’m actually enjoying this.” And I was. I played a great show, felt energized, clean, and clear, and best of all for me, my mood was level. 

To repeat: my mood was LEVEL.

Literally can’t remember the last time I didn’t go a day without having a major flip-out over some stupid insignificant annoyance. I think yesterday was a game changer for me. So now it’s just wash, rinse, repeat. Exercise. Everyone says it, my husband has been trying to get me to do it for the longest time, but sometimes we just don’t want to hear it (speaking for myself anyway...).

Give it a try, it might be a game changer for you, too.

I smoked daily and heavily for the past 5-7 years and i'm now on day 5.
 
I get pretty disassociated and i'm extra prone to anxiety and panic attacks (I already suffered from these while I was smoking but now it's getting pretty hardcore).

I also seem to wake up in between sleep cycles. Getting to sleep is kind of okay since i still use alcohol, but I hate waking up every 2 hours. My dreams are also insanely vivid and weird but I know this is a common thing when quitting.

It's been a rough two weeks. I haven't been sleeping well, feeling very depressed, sad and anxious. I've struggled to eat and lost a fair bit of weight. I've suffered headaches and general low energy levels. It's been exactly what I was bracing myself for, but this time around has been a LOT harder than in the past. 

Today has been the first day that I feel somewhat ok. I have no cravings to smoke but I'm still feeling a little tired and foggy. My anxiety has settled down a lot. I still feel pretty rough in the mornings but no longer wake up feeling like my world is about to end. My dreams (or more accurately nightmares) are still continuing, but I can deal with that. I'm procrastinating a lot when I really should be getting stuck into some tasks to keep my mind occupied.

There is a very strong feeling that something is missing though. It's hard to describe. I know I've made the right choice but I no longer have my smelly green friend to fall back on when things get rough, when I need a break from the rat race, when I just wanna kick back and not engage my brain. Now is the time to find the things that make me happy to fill the missing space.

Yesterday I rationalized my current situation like this... Before I quit, I was unhappy and life felt hopeless. Now I feel unhappy but life feels hopeful. In other words, it's shit but a better kind of shit. 

I'm hoping the worst is behind me now. The coming weeks are still gonna be rough but I NEED to keep a positive mindset to get to a more stable place. If past experiences have taught me anything, it's that cravings can still hit me even months after quitting. They usually pass quickly though. I need to stay strong and not fool myself that having a sneaky joint will not have any repercussions. It always does for me. I can't moderate. I just can't... and I've learned that the hard way many times.

Thanks to everyone on this board for their support and positivity. Stay blessed :)",20

The examen is heavy in what you need to know, and weed is dragging me slow/down.

I was studied well for 3 months straight and I could study then chill with some weed but it's been 2-3 months I haven't done much than smoke weed and play guitar/video games. 

I also did workout every day but now I am floppy. Someone in this situation? I stopped for like 4 days but since I have virtually unlimited weed it's hard.

I've been smoking pot for 8 years now. Been wanting to stop for about 6. 5 or so years ago I tried over and over again and kept failing. The weed screwed my life up. I'm now at a point where I can fix my mistakes this year but it's touch and go. I have a few subjects to pass to graduate college and they'll throw me out if I fail any this year. That would be 7 years wasted. Yes I said 7

Admittedly it's a 5 year course. But for me it's 7. I don't think weed is the REASON, I think the reason is my immaturity, but I think the weed allows me to stay in this bubble. I'm 25,staying with my parents, and for the first time in my life I'm ready to get things going and make a life for myself. At this point weed is no longer self medication to me. Ive fallen out of love with it. It's just a hard habit right now. I wake up planning to be dry all day and it's like I go into autopilot and just start driving and calling my dealer. It all happens so fast and I'm not denying responsibility, it's 100% on me, but I really don't feel in control while I'm trying to get my hands on weed. I'll lie and justify my actions any way I can until I get my fix. That's when I start feeling regret and guilt. It's been a vicious cycle of that- quitting, relapse, self loathing. I'm finally ready. Well I thought I was yesterday until i bought myself a bag and screwed up.

I'm super addicted guys. I smoke morning to night every day. I tried stopping yesterday and lasted til about 3pm. The morning was so boring.

My life outside of weed is better than its ever been aside from my studies. I'm hitting major goals in the gym and looking to compete in bodybuilding, I have a great gf, good nutrition and most my friends don't smoke anymore/ smoke way less than me. This is just an unnecessary expense at the moment that makes me lazy and flat.

I'm also on antidepressants, likely due to substance abuse causing some issues a few years back (weed was always my biggest demon but I liked to drink and take a few pills when I was younger) but they do their job well and will likely make the quitting process less painful",10

I just want to share my little story here and I would love to hear some thoughts and advices of how you dealt with it. 
(You can skip the first section if you want)

First I've been quite anti but suddenly after school i decided to give it a try and I have to say that doing so changed me for good.
It kind of helped breaking out of, what i would call, an imprisoned mind.
The years went on and the abusive behavior started within about the third year of smoking, I'd say. I kind of realised that it turned into a habit because it makes you feel comfy in quite a lot of ways and nearly everyone i knew was a pothead as well so it's been just a quite common thing to do as well.
In Winter 2017 i started Uni and that's when i started realising that it's messing me up big time, so i decided that something needs to change and I tried but I constantly failed after trying to evolve a healthy use of it again. It seemed to be good for a couple of times but at one point I fell back into the abusive behavior. Being at Uni where no one really expects anything of you isn't really supportive either, quite a few people here are in a similar situation so it's easy to feel comfy within this circle.
Well now I'm in the end of the second year, i didn't do a lot of things that should've been done by now and the usual semester always started with me smoking shitloads of pot and knowing that I'd have to stop at one point in the next few weeks to be able to study for the exams... (I already stopped a few times)
Here we are again, 6 exams, some of them quite tough, are ahead. I tried quitting during the holiday break and it worked out quite well, fewer cravings then before and better sleep then before, but last week i had to go back to Uni and guess what happened. I know I should stop and I know I'm damaging myself but I still end up smoking for the sake of good sleep but not evene this worked out well. So I decided to go back home (which is not too far from uni).

I'm on day 4 now, no cravings and the foggy mind starts clearing up. I've been able to do a bit of studying since yesterday as well, but I'm also constantly thinking about my habit and my future.
I had a mental breakdown last summer and from then on smoking could make me feel very anxious and uncomfy, but somehow i still did it. And that's the point.
I love weed, especially because it helped me in the very beginning and i do know that it can be used for good but I also know that it can fuck you up big time. But i still love it and i want to go ahead and beat addiction by setting up a plan for this year, doing an internship on the countryside during summer (since i developed the worst habits in summer), exercising and meditating and so on. But I don't want to tell myself that i will stop forever since I think that banning something out of your life is some kind of weakness as well, and people around me will continue smoking, i cannot always hide from them or ban those people out of my life as well.",2

She told me it is not true that weed is completely safe and the DSM-5 actually has cannabis dependence listed as a psychiatric disorder (she was about to show it to me on a thick book for proof in case I was still hesitant). She basically reassured me that smoking weed can in fact cause a lot of health/mood problems and that it is one of the top reasons leading up to psychosis. She told me how the weed quality varies from dealer to dealer (weed is illegal in my country) and it's a total russian roulette and it's way too expensive for such risk. We discussed my work performance and how I felt in general and it's super clear that I'm doing so much better sober (physically and mentally). I've already known these but hearing it from a professional's point of view did a MAJOR change. She told me she was thinking about prescribing some medication the last time we talked but she said that I made a lot of progress in the last month and I'm psychologically healing and in remission, so there's no need for medication for now. She also said she needs to see me in a month again to make sure I didn't relapse and that I need to be aware of my *sensitivity* towards this substance and that I shouldn't ever be ashamed of what I've been through. So that's all you ppl, it was a great decision to get professional help and I just wanted to share my experience in hopes of it being helpful to someone. Peace",19

Smoking for me started out with friends and was fun. A few months later, I started buying my own stash, and then that’s when I felt like It became my everything. I would work and smoke weed. Anytime I was home, I had a bowl packed.  

This was my life for about 8 years. The last 2 years where filled with mostly depression. Trying to stop and failing to do so. And so many other emotions.

It always get worse before it gets better kinda summed up the beginning of 2019 for me.  Depression was at an all time high (pun intended, haha) i just couldn’t take it and living those first few months in daily agony was enough. I knew that I HAD to stop and I knew it was gonna be tough.

First two weeks were the worse. Everyday, i would read, watch, occupy my time with everything and anything that had to do with not smoking weed. Keeping those positive thought in my head. Things got easier.

I made it to 90 days weed free! Fell back into it for two weeks, then started all over again.

And now I’m here today! 113 days weed free! My first 90 days started at the end of March. It’s crazy to think that 2019 was filled with more non smoking days than smoking days! First year in 8 years!

When I give it up for a week or more, I feel amazing and I know that weed was holding me back. If I can start taking care of myself, cleaning my apartment, and staying on top of my work, then I feel great about my life - I don't even need weed to get me through. But if I slip up and smoke even once, I usually eat a lot of junk food, skip brushing my teeth the next morning, miss a meeting or two, etc, then without these things to feel good about myself, I can't help but focus on the negatives. How lonely I am, how my career is going nowhere. I'll tell myself that I *need* pot to make it through to the next day, to avoid thinking about how disappointed in me everyone is gonna be.

It feels like I need to be perfect in order to beat this weed habit. Otherwise just one slip ruins me. I can't be perfect, I'm only human. This is so damn hard :-(",4

I started smoking to escape my life. I felt powerless over a bunch of different factors in my life that I had couldn’t change (my parents not being the model types, lack of close family, my financial situation and how divided our economy is, and so on). So, I smoked to numb myself out and feel better carrying on. 

What no one told me was how smoking would lead me to being apathetic and numb to things I did have power over, and stop me from doing all I could to feel good despite sometimes shitty circumstances. 

49 days without smoking has freed up so much of my time, energy and awareness to focus on things that would help me — exercising, meditating, painting, reading books, actually listening to and being present with my friends —instead of being too high to be present in my daily life. 

The moments I got back are the best ones and the most ordinary — feeling sensations in my body again, tuning into how I’m really feeling and letting those emotions ride their course. I’ve also lost 6 lbs from not stuffing myself with the munchies constantly, which isn’t bad either. :)

Thanks to this community for opening my eyes to this being possible. I can proudly say I really don’t need to smoke anymore, though I’m so thankful for the crutch it gave me when I really needed one.

However, my brother told me this is the place to be if I want to quit smoking weed. I’m only 17, and have been smoking since I was about 13, everyday since I was 15. So here I am. Reasons I’m quitting:
- I’ve been using cannabis as a way to numb myself out, I want to feel my emotions as they truly are. 
- Wondering if I’ll have enough time/money to incorporate weed into my daily schedule. It shouldn’t be a priority in my life.
- My memory has gone down the gutter.
- I’ve lost touch with people who I love, and gained connections with others just because of a plant.
- The risk of getting in trouble with school/the police. I’ve already been caught up once, and was lucky enough to get away with a clean slate. 
- My health. My lungs do not deserve this.
- I’m so young, drugs should be none of my concern. I need to focus on graduating high school.
- I’ve always brushed it off. “Well, I could quit. I just don’t want/see a need to” or “I get good grades and go to school, what’s the problem?” or “I do what I need to. Smoking just makes it more fun.” That’s all sounding like bullshit to me. No more excuses.

It's weird how completely STUPID you get when you don't smoke for a really long time and then you have a few puffs of a joint. You can't remember what the last 4 words out your mouth were lmao. Anyway, my point was, obviously it affects your short term memory but is there any evidence of it affecting your long term and if there is some timeline of when you are able to call back things quicker. This morning I was trying to remember a word that I'd use in a sentence often and I could not remember what it was and I do this often.

In my particular case, I decided to quit in a foreign country where I had no friends, family or support system. Day 8 came by and I finally got some sleep, and now almost hitting the two week mark I really feel better. Of course I still have rebound anxiety (I used weed to push that anxiety down for 4 years), and I am definitely not out of the woods yet, but feeling this good makes me never want to go back again. Right now I'm starting to get hit by these emotions that have been suppressed for so long.

2. I know I'm an addict, I can't just ""smoke today then be good for a week"" if i smoke i go until its gone
3. For my mom.  Just got off the phone with her and I felt how hard I have disappointed her these past few years (I deal with some mental health issues) This is hard, she lives in another state but whenever she visits we always smoke.  She supports me quitting though so thats nice.
4. I can't run/I don't work out at all ever since becoming a pothead
5. It doesn't really provide much relaxation, and the process and energy and cost of acquiring it is too tiresome now
6. As many people have said ""Weed makes you okay with being just okay"" and I've always wanted to push myself.  I know there will ""always be someone x better than you"" but I'm certain I've basked in medicority as a result of the dull buzz from pot these past few years
7. Though my meds and my general mental health/state has been ok, I know weed is still my crutch for ""oh man im about to go out and see tons of people"" or ""oh shoot i have to be baked to play this video game""...

Thank you all for listening and for any comments/suggestions.  I have worked a program before but gave up at Step 5, I feel my sobriety is best when its more private with those I know in real life.  The only folks who know right now are my dealer and my mom.  You guys of course too but since its online it doesnt bear the same weight on me.  Thanks again.",124

The longest break I’ve had was 6 weeks and I’m desperately trying to make it to 90 days this time and hopefully much longer.

I would always have an excuse on why I needed it. But in truth i was scared of what i would be Iike without it. 
It got bad when i lost my job b.c of me smoking when I accidentally left some in my bag and i was forced to quit my job.

Can I get through Day One?,"34M here, smoked almost daily since the beginning of 2017. I've quit a few times, the longest being two months last summer, but it's never lasted. I initially started my quitting journey back after Thanksgiving because I wanted to start the New Year strong and sober.  Unfortunately, I fell off the wagon over the holidays.  I was going to stop again on New Years Day but that didn't happen.  I did make it two weeks though and at the end of those two weeks, was already starting to notice the benefits.

Reasons I'm quitting:

- I moved to a new city three months ago and I believe that cannabis is impacting my ability to re-establish my life here.  My start has been rockier than I initially anticipated.

- I'm currently working in a dead-end high volume call center job that's making me miserable.  I've also done this since the recession and I'm sick of it.  I have a degree in IT and the economy now is much better than it was in 2009-10 but my inability to pass a pre-employment drug screening has prevented me from searching for a better job.  My morals will not allow me to fake it.

- I no longer have any hobbies, passions, or ambitions beyond smoking weed.  I've become more or less a boring person.

- Social smoking is fun but when I'm sober, it's as if I'm living life through a fog and social interacting is much more difficult than it is after I've gone about a couple of weeks without smoking.  I'm naturally an introvert and have social anxiety and while cannabis initially benefited me in this area, I find that today it's a detriment and makes the problem much worse when I'm sober.  I find I really don't have any friends anymore beyond smoking buddies.

- It's illegal in the state I'm currently living in.  The state has medical marijuana but from everyone I've talked to, most employers don't care if you have a card and are still committed to a zero-tolerance policy for THC.  That means even if I got my card, I'd still have to either quit or fake a test to find a new job.

What is working against me:

- My job is extremely stressful (I work in a call center) and when I get off, I want nothing more than to just light up and relax.

- Severe depression.  When I don't smoke, my depression kicks into high gear.  I have to deal with not only the fact that I don't have a life or any real friends nor do I have social skills or anything that makes me interesting, but also the fact that my entire adult life has been one mistake and failure after another.  This is not how my life was supposed to end up.  There's no quick fix though.

- My best friend and currently the only support I have in this life is a heavy stoner. He suggests that I keep smoking because it does help with my depression.  Problem is it's a short-term solution that has created a long-term problem.

- I simply love cannabis.  When I don't smoke I tend to drink alcohol more, but alcohol is a lot worse for you and the buzz isn't near as nice.  However, one thing I learned from my two-month quit last summer is that long-term abstinence from cannabis makes alcohol in moderation more enjoyable.  I just had to avoid replacing weed with alcohol during the early days of my quit.",3

2020-01-13 12:18:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eo73ek/time_to_face_the_truth/,Time to face the truth...,"I have been a pretty regular consumer of cannabis for the past 12 years, mostly every day with some periods extending up to 6 months where I’ve avoided it. My cycle tends to be that I will smoke heavily (morning to night) for a long time, until I feel stuck in a lethargic apathetic hole, at which point I’ll reach a breaking point and stop smoking. I’ll be amazed at how clear my thoughts are and how much motivation I suddenly have, starting projects, finishing old ones and connecting on a deeper level with those around me, without the paranoia and social anxiety that weed gives me. 

Then, after a while, I’ll see functional stoners either in the media or in my friendship group and start to imagine that I could be one… I typically buy a small amount with the intention of using it to finish a creative process or something along those lines, and within a month or two I’ll be back to smoking every day. 

When I’m in this I’ll find lots of reasons to support my decision, researching the health benefits of thc and cbd and immersing myself in cannabis related content on youtube etc, whilst still knowing deep down that this is something I don’t want to be doing. This form of double bluffing myself I think makes me quite depressed and I think people around me can pick up on this internal friction.

At first I think it is possible to live a functional and normal life with moderate cannabis consumption, then I think that it is possible to function well being constantly stoned, and then the whole house of cards comes crashing down. 

But I really am done with it now. The effects are no longer even enjoyable for me, and the signs along the way have all pointed to it being something I should leave behind…

Within a few years of smoking I was caught smoking at school and was suspended. After this my grades started to slip and my interests narrowed. 

I have been deported from the US for having a small amount of weed which I didn’t know was in my wallet.

A few months after this I very almost got caught by Thai police with a joint on me, and thankfully I managed to get away down the beach without being followed by them.

I have just got over a horrible sickness which I believe was from smoking some poorly pressed homemade hash which turned mouldy… I had been smoking it daily over the last month or so and I didn’t realise until it was too late that it was mouldy. I was worried for my health for a short while, not knowing if or when the sickness would subside (some types of mould in the lungs/bloodstream can be very dangerous).

My relationships, grades and motivation in life have suffered as a result of the pursuit of being stoned. The signs have been there all along to tell me to stop. 

I haven’t smoked in 4 days. Fortunately I don’t ever experience withdrawals when stopping, aside a slight difficulty sleeping.

I think there is now a very unbalanced view of weed in the media, with people glossing over the numerous negative effects in favour of the many positives. I am aware that it affects everyone differently but for me I’m done with the pursuit of the idea that I can live a functional and happy life with marijuana as an ally.

Of course there was that little voice that said “think how much better you’ll feel with one edible, you can just have it tonight and have a great time and feel better and resume your sobriety tomorrow.” But we all know that’s not how it works, and even though I know deep down that I will spiral out of control if I listen to that voice, it is still so hard to resist!

But I did resist it. Tomorrow will be 14 days sober, my new year’s leavers where you at? I don’t want to give up my progress for anything. I love how I feel. I’m losing weight, working out, doing IMF and it’s so much easier without the influence of munchies! I’m feeling more social and connected with the world around me. I went to a music shop this weekend and struck up a conversation with a stranger, and ended up making a friend. We exchanged numbers and planned on getting together to jam and record some time soon. It may sound pathetic but weed made me so isolated and locked in my own head that I haven’t made a new friend in a very long time. I was a heavy smoker for about 17 years.

I've been smoking almost daily for the past 15 years except for a few periods here and there where I would say I'm quitting but then a few weeks or even months in I would relapse, always telling myself that it's fine, that I can live a complete life while having that crutch with me, when in reality I'm just deceiving myself.

Looking back at one time I didn't use for a year or so, I remember how much I accomplished that year - I ended up moving from just having a job to starting a career, I didn't have trouble engaging with attractive women, I started my own business which later collapsed due to me relapsing. Yet I keep coming back. There's things I love about it, things I've discovered about myself and the world thanks to it, but it makes me numb, it is an escape hatch for me in the long run. It makes me look inward instead of outward. When I'm using I don't really care about anyone or anything, I just coast by since everything seems so wonderful with it in my life. 

It pains me so much to have to say goodbye to it but I'm getting older and at some point I won't be able to reach my full potential if I keep it with me. I want to see the other side, I want to give it my all and see where it takes me. I last smoked three days ago and today I plan on destroying my pipe. I hope I can make it this time. I know I can.",3

1. break a daily cycle of working, then getting deeply depressed for no apparent reason on the way home, then smoking until I was sedated and then have dreamless not really restful sleep. Repeat (this goal was already achieved around week 3!)

2. Do more in my free time other than smoke and be sedated. Read and write more. Work on creative projects. Meet more people, etc (this was the last goal to be reached. Only yesterday. Though it has been slow but steady progress towards this the whole time) 

3. Be more productive in my work time and feel more satisfied with my results at the office (got there towards end of week 3 beginning of week 4)

From lurking here since some months now I know that this is just a preview of what I can achieve if I stick to it for 3 months, 6 months and beyond. I am really hoping this will be the case.

I go back to work today and because my girlfriend is also going back home for the week (she's still at Uni) the thought of tackling the week essentially on my own is killing me and cutting through any motivation I have.

Even if I'm as productive as I can be (work, gym, doing the washing etc.) I always find myself time to worry and panic about the situation I'm going through. I'm just scared in all honesty to go into the week and tackle it, and it's a killer feeling that I'm really not used to. The 'erb would act like a warm hug in times like this, so I've never properly struggled with being on my own because I'd just blaze up, play some PS4 or watch some Netflix and the thought of doing any of those activities couldn't be any less appealing.

I know I can call or text or FaceTime my girlfriend essentially whenever, but it's not the same knowing that I'm still stuck on my own. And like I said to her, as much as I love her support and comfort, I need to be in a position to deal with it without her because I can't place all my happiness and comfort in her hands (as much as she does make me happy and comfortable, I want to be able to feel that on my own... Which I thought I did when I was smoking).

I guess I'm looking for some tips to get through it and manage the week ahead. Thanks though guys, and best of luck to everyone else going into this new week!",2

I am just glad to open my eyes on the addiction that I had.
Was living in a dream like state for few years. 
Got stuck in the same routine.
All my friends are smokers as well, part of the weed's subtle effects.

Its so subtle, I didn't know about it. I thought nothing wrong with me.

The trigger for the awakening was that my gf went for a month long trip alone, when she was on her trip I almost didn't spoke to her.
She must have felt so bad...
Anyway she got back, saw additional addictions over at her trip and decided that she doesn't want to be with an addict.
At first when she told me the news I was non reactive, I told her that its ok and I thought that its about time for me to he bachelor.
Some weeks have passed, I got into smoking all day everyday for few months already.

I was looking subconsciously to stop.

Started reading Russel Brand's book ""Recovery"".
It has put some positive thoughts in my mind. 
But my mind is still under the mists of the weed.
My addicted brain works to sabotage.

Then I wanted to try taking LSD to kinda restart my brain because I have read some comments and studies that being done now regarding PTSD and psychedelics.

Took one tab on a free day.
During the trip lots of memories have come up of me before the drugs, of our relationship with my ex.
It has opened my eyes on the addiction that I have.
All the ways it is manifest in my life.
It has showed me how it has changed my way of thinking.
I saw everything crystal clear.
Was reading this sub during the trip and it has enhanced my thoughts of getting clean.

This journey really opened my eyes, 
Day 3 here we go.
We all gonna make it.",5

So I figured I would go to a dispensary. Nope. In fact when I saw the lines and the shortages and the amount they taxed, I was so turned off that I just stopped using. Day 7 and I guess my mind has cleared up a bit. Depression is still there. Being diagnosed with dysthymic disorder, it probably will always be there. Nobody noticed any changes in me...so I guess I was good at hiding it. I was functional but still was making bad decisions. They just haven't caught up to me. I'm not sure how long I will stop. I just know that I used weed as a form of sedation. I now have to face reality and it's one scary place. Nobody cared that I used. I still went to work. I still got shit done around the house. I just did it in a daze. Moments melted together yet I didnt remember what I talked about or did. What scared me though was the anxiety that it would produce. I would get so paranoid while I would drive. I could have killed someone if my mind went elsewhere at a red light. Yet I still would continue to use even at work and at home and at parties and even at restaurants I would go to the bathroom and take a few hits. It was a necessity for me to do it. I would make sure I knew where my pen was at all costs. I would have extra lying around just in case. I didnt think it was a problem because I still would function. Nobody noticed i was high because honestly i wasnt getting high after a certain point. I would just feel numb. Elsewhere. I knew this was bad. I just didnt care. Quitting weed wont be hard. Working on the reasons why I used will be the hard part. Thank you for listening.",16

To find this group is such a relief for me, to know there are others out there who are finding peace of mind without ganja!
I have been smoking daily for the last 15 years, only having a break when I couldn't score (live in a country where it's not legal) . I would wake and bake, smoke in the afternoons and before bed time,  truly believing that weed enhanced my life. However, the last 2 years I have been dealing with alot of stress ( adhd child, went back to university at 28 for a 4 year degree, working as well as being a partner to an amazing man), and I have been smoking whenever I felt stress or any negative emotion. Now when I dont have weed I am instantly in a bad mood and incredibly irritable and I feel that life sucks without it and on the hunt to score all day. Yet, when I smoke up, the high only lasts so long and soon again I am back in my feelings.
My partner has noticed the change in me and has talked to me about using weed as an emotional crutch.... so I have made the commitment to stop smoking. 
I am nervous as I work night shift and I find it incredibly difficult to sleep, I also feel like I am saying goodbye to a friend who has always been there for me. Anyways... I just wanted to post my experience and link up with people with a similar mindset. If anyone has any advice I would much appreciate it, but I will keep reading thru posts on this thread :)",42

It didn’t matter to me that I didn’t really like anything about my life except the pot. (sorry to my friends)

I recently had to move back to my hometown because my dad dropped dead (divorced parents, only child) 
He was a hoarder and left me a Big Mess and 8 storage units of stuff to go through. 

Now I used to smoke a lot of weed but nothing like the monster amount I’ve been smoking lately. I keep telling myself it’s helpful for the grieving/ overwhelming sorting process. But in reality, while I’ve done an incredible amount stoned off the sativa, I simply don’t have the mental acuity for the tasks I need to accomplish.....to the point I had to ask my mom to take off work and fly out here to help me for a week. 

Mom hates weed and I cannot let her know I’ve been smoking nor can I smoke while she’s helping me which has made the past 4 days very difficult but also made me realize how addicted I am. She thinks I’m just acting out from the grief but I’m really frustrated I can’t be stoned for this!!!! So now I’m being an asshole to my only living parent who I begged to come here to help me (which makes me feel worse and probably doesn’t make her feel good either)

I’m afraid I’ll just end up smoking again when she leaves this week. I have a med card and I live alone in a house overfilled with my dead dad’s things (and he’s not here to tell me “don’t smoke inside!” So I just roll 6 spliffs at a time and chainsmoke while going through the rooms)

Does anyone have any advice on not smoking + managing an extremely stressful situation without any outside ppl present to keep you accountable? Has anyone quit smoking in the year their parent died?",1

Little did I know weed the negative effects weed could have until I hit a new recent low point. About four days ago I began feeling sick and I thought it was Just a common cold. Three days in I’m still groggy and sick and that’s when I began having racing thoughts and my anxiety was heightened in ways I had never experienced before. This is when I visited the ER and was told I had low potassium (potentially caused by weed). The entire time I sat in that hospital my mind raced and raced and the feeling of hopelessness wouldn’t leave me. Ever since that day I’ve been depressed and have had similar panic attacks since. Im sorry Im not the best story teller but I’m writing this more as a journal than anything but I’m going to quit weed. I swear it. Any support helps today is January 12th.,8

Braindead, Emotionless, Depressed, Sleepless, Not hungry.","Hi everyone, 26 years old male. Been experimenting with weed/hash when i got 12 due to my mother having to smoke medical, prescription marihuana (i wont and cant blame her) (Please forgive my bad english, im from the netherlands), and then got addicted to only weed from around my 13th untill 3 days ago. I legit, havent been a few days sober ever since, it happend a few times, that i, or we, didnt have money to get some, but, as the smokers we were, that problem was always solved quite quickly (the same day, or the day after). Which means i have been smoking weed for 13 years, i didnt start off easy tho, i was in love with it from the first time i have ever used it, so that resulted in me and my friends, struggling to get our weed every single day (13 years old going to a dealer because weedstores here are 18+... Imagine the guy didnt care about our age at all...). From my 16th birthday i got permission to smoke from my mother, because she noticed she couldnt stop me anyway... (she tried everything, i didnt let her). I smoked about 2grams each day when being alone, spread out over +- 10 joints. When with friends, that was easy between 5-10gr a day. Sometimes even more when rolling blunts, or sticking the rolling papers to each other. It literally got out of hand, real bad, but i didnt want to see it back then, i didnt see how it harmed me, besides from costing alot of money. The past ... year? I have been struggling to quit smoking in my head, kept telling myself, i'll finish this bag, then ill quit. Woke up the next morning and drove right away to the coffeeshop (dutch for weedstore). This happend on and off, sometimes i tried, sometimes i was like nahh, let me just get my weed right now so i dont have to worry about it tomorrow... When time past, the feeling, the need to quit smoking got stronger and stronger. I was completely depressed, life was literally sucked out of me, hated the world and everything in it including myself. I lost 2 relationships in 7 years, can still cry about that. Those 2 girls were loyal as can be, helped me out with anything, you could say they were ""dreamgirls"" to have a relationship with. But yet again, that didnt make me stop either. They asked me to stop (both in seperate relationships) but i didnt. Kept smoking  hundreds and hundreds of euro's a month. Heaps of weed were stashed in my safe, while my girl couldnt even buy herself something nice at that moment. I guess thats what weed does to you, you dont give a crap about anything or anyone anymore, no matter how important they are, as long as you have your weed. So, the last relationship ended december 2018 (breakup right before christmas also..) and from that moment my brain started to sloooowllyyyy hate weed more and more, untill 3 days ago. I still felt completely depressed, hated the world and myself, lost all my friends, relationships,and i was like, how can this feeling ever, just ever get worse then it already is?

Well i was wrong there... 

I put all my supplies (grinder, papers, tips, weed etc) in my safe, and i went to bed after. The next day was hmm, i missed the weed, but i had smoked a big last blunt the night before, so, i wasnt sober yet you know. Some time went by, and when it started to get dark outside, it kicked in. I felt SO depressed, i actually got scared of it, i didnt want to live with this feeling you know. But i man'd up, went for a huge walk with my dog, got back, took a shower, watched some tv then went to bed. It was a sleepless night, got in bed around 00.00, got out 9.30 without any sleep, my head was busy, i was sweating like crazy, bedsheets were soaked, i felt tired as hell, but yet i didnt manage to get any sleep. Next day was hell. Straight up hell, it felt like i was fighting every second every minute, to say no to it. For my feeling, there didnt passed a minute without having thoughts like : Grab it, roll some, you will feel betther after. I kept fighting those thoughts, and i succeeded through the day and evening with blood sweat and tears. (Okay maybe no blood, but atleast alot of sweat and tears).
Day 3... today... I will not write down my actual thoughts here, to keep the reddit page clean, but man.... i cant... i fk*n cant anymore ... :(.
The day was a struggle, but with alot of strength and self control i managed to not go smoke some. I feel that it gets harder and harder tho, while i really hope that this feeling will fade away... Ive been through ALOT in my life, ive seen things, done things i cant explain. But none of that gave me a feeling like this, like quitting the weed. I think this might be the hardest battle i have ever fought, and i just hope and pray to god that i can make it to the end. I have never been sober for 3 days, in 13 years, i dont wanna fall back and have to start over, i dont wanna deal with all this again... I think im only seeing things black and negative now. No sunshine for me yet, not even close... 

Currently laying in my bed, 02.25, havent slept in 2 nights 3 days (even past the hallucination stage already, which was not bad at all comparing to what im going through right now. Im afraid this is gonna be ANOTHER sleepless, soaking wet night, making it night 3, day 4 of no sleep...

ANY motivation, ANY tips, ANY tricks are more then welcome to survive this battle.

Again, sorry for the long post but i really had to write this off me, and i been lurking a few months already on reddit leaves, so i figured this would be a good time to post my story. Also sorry again for my english :)

Stay safe and mostly stay strong yall... We got this... i think...",6

Given these circumstances it makes quitting smoking to perform better in school seem futile.

I went 45 days without weed but relapsed during the holidays. I’m writing this as a reminder to myself for when I am tempted to smoke again and in case it’s helpful for others.

1) Weed is bad for my mental health. After the initial effects wear off, I am socially anxious, prone to anger, and disassociated from myself and from others. Because I am in such a haze, it makes it harder to regulate my emotions. It makes me take small things as an affront to my sense of self. A lot of emotional ups and downs. I almost ruined my relationship because of this (I was able to start dating this girl because I quit weed and start to get my shit together). Without weed, I am more grounded, balanced, and in touch with myself. 

2) The need to smoke again is very steep. I may be convinced that I’ll just smoke once and go back to not smoking. But once I smoke once, something happens in my brain chemistry. I think “hey this isn’t so bad,” and keep doing it again and again. Smoking weed now has become like walking past a steep hill. It’s very difficult to climb back out. But it’s possible. It takes a hell of a lot of willpower though. 

3) Weed encourages delusional thinking. I’ve had some profound thoughts on weed, and I think it made me a more open minded person, but it makes me arrive at hasty conclusions about other people and myself, and more open to out-there ideas. It’s mostly smoke and mirrors. The greatest delusion, though, is the emotional, visceral feeling that life is just better with weed, and that life without it is boring and pointless. That’s far from the truth. 

4) I am still a creative person without weed. It’s fun to get stoned and play music, but when I smoke regularly, I get convinced that I am only creative when I am stoned. This is another delusional thought. The truth is that I am still creative without weed, but on top of that, I am more focused, which leads to actually getting stuff done. Because I am a more functional person when I am sober, I am a more functional artist as well.

5) Other activities/hobbies go out the window. When I smoke, I am much less likely to work out, read, and meditate. I am also less likely to go out to social events. Even when I do go, I have less fun because I am so in my head. 

I’ll end this by quoting what someone else said on here: “life without weed is so fundamentally non-problematic.”",23

My girlfriend is going back home for the week as she's currently at Uni, so knowing I'm going to be on my own for the whole evening is making me very uncomfortable/sad. Usually I'd just get stoned, game and that'd be the end of it, but because I'm now sober, the thought of it is something I'm struggling with.

Is anybody else experiencing something similar or have any tips on battling through? My anxiety is through the roof, despite today being easier than previous ones, and I feel extremely lost. Thanks a lot and all the best, guys!",3

In 5 hours I will have completed my first week.

Day1 was hell, day two was frustrating, day 3 I cried when I ran, but since then it’s been plain sailing.

I’m being careful not to lul myself into a sense of security, I’ve tried to quit before so I know how sneakily weed can creep back in.

However this time it’s been completely different, I’ve only had the nights sweats and dreams that accompany them twice so far, when I say I cried when I ran on day 3, they were tears of joy, of relief. I honestly felt like a weight had been lifted.
Don’t get me wrong, the cravings still appear from time to time, but there nothing like I’d imagined and although at times I may want it, I don’t miss it at all.

I think my conscience has accepted the fact my life is a sack of shit on the weed, and is just waiting for my body and brain to jump on the train to freedom with it.

I keep telling myself don’t take this for granted, the depression, the nightmares, the flu symptoms. Insomnia.. it may creep up at anytime. 

I smoked daily for the past 10 years. 100 pound a week habit.

My life revolved around weed.
I couldn’t sleep with out it, and I couldn’t “be myself “ with out it.
Accepting I’m an addict was the best decision I’ve ever made. I realised I didn’t even know who myself was in the first place..

And boy am I fucking excited to find out.


This subreddit is a big part of my journey and a massive motivator, and for that I thank you.

I'm a 21 year old male, and I've used for about the last 5 years. The first few years started off as some sort of mystical adventure but as time went on and the magic slowly started to fade. I started using several times a day for years. I would use over half my measly paychecks for this drug. Whenever I didn't have the money I'd pawn my belongings or even go as low as to borrowing the money from someone. People have always told me weed isn't addictive. That it's some miracle drug that cures depression/cancer/anything under the sun. I unfortunately I've come to learn that it isn't as safe as everyone says. The past few years I have felt my mental health deteriorate. I've become more and more depressed after every failed attempt of quitting. I've put myself into credit card debt, I've missed my college classes, making myself in debt to the college for what I missed. I'm a hollow shell of the person I used to be.

I started smoking a few years ago when I went through some life changes and found myself mostly alone. It made my creative work fun, it made me not feel lonely and sad and it made life more interesting.

I didn’t need friends or family (who all let me down) because at least I had weed. But after a long time of using, it just didn’t have the same effects on me. The glorious fog cleared and I began to see that I was still lonely, my life was sad and I then realised I was addicted. What kind of friend is that? 

I also realised that I do have some friends but I don’t relate to them anymore because weed has changed me so much.

I’ve tried to stop so many times but there’s certain things that I do (in order to even have a little bit of happiness or sanity) that I have now attached to weed!

I want to cry.. infact I am crying as I write this because I’m now in a cache22. I want to stop but I feel so bad, sad and demotivated to work (since I attached weed to certain tasks that have deadlines). I don’t even have time to be feeling withdrawal and sad because of those deadline!!

I always say I’ll smoke till my deadline but then the deadline goes and I still smoke and the work still doesn’t get completed.


I want to stop wasting my money I want to be more focused I want to stop having weed just there but I can’t lie it’s difficult when weed is the main reason I can still stay in my current environment without going crazy or having a mental breakdown.


I’m fighting the urge to go and get weed right now hence why I am writing this.

My official no weed date is the 15th Jan but I just think why can’t I just stop it now. It’s only 3 days away.. I really feel disappointed that I let myself get this stage.",3

1. Run a half marathon

Before quitting, you would never have seen me wake up on a Sunday morning before 8:00am. I’d smoke all day on Saturday and wake up on Sunday in a haze. I’d usually sleep the day away, dreading going into work on Monday. Well, I woke up this morning at 6:30 and ran a half marathon :)

2. Go on a cruise

You can’t bring weed into a cruise ship without risking some very very serious consequences. It’s not just the risk of a possession charge from the state, on a ship it’s the risk of getting arrested in a foreign country. And you’d have to hide your weed and sneak around the ship for a place to smoke it. 

But I’m free from that! I can go on a 7 day cruise and not once have the urge to smoke. I can sit on a balcony and just enjoy the view instead of waiting for the next time I can light my bowl. I’ve been on two cruises since quitting and I’m already planning a third!

3. Go to work without fear of a random drug test

This one seems small, but that lifting of paranoia from my shoulders is a huge thing. My job does fandoms and I would keep a bottle of QuickFix in my purse in case I ever got called for a random screening. But no more worries! I can pee in the cup at any time and hand it to the nurse with a smile on my face!

4. Become a foster parent 

My husband and I have always wanted to foster, but you can’t have kids in the house (especially kids who are in the care of the state) if you’re constantly doing drugs. You also have to be able to pass the pre-screening tests which may involve a drug test. We’re still in the beginning stages, but I can maybe one day be a foster parent and help some kid have a home :)

There’s other things like being able to focus on my hobbies. Actually completing craft and sewing projects. Being able to wake up in the morning and hop out of bed and go to work without getting high. 

Life gets so much better once you quit. I’m never going back.",35

Every night since I've quit I have dreamt about sitting at my desktop with my dab pen and just chiefing it. In the dream it feels so euphoric and indescribable like when I was brand new to smoking. That feeling of complete elevation and disconnection from reality. The wax in the pen is like liquid gold and it feels so good to just hit it. It's impossible to describe, but its even more intense in the dream than it is in reality. 

At first I would wake up relieved that it was just a dream but recently I'm feeling disappointed because the dreams are just so amazing. It makes me want to go buy a dab pen. I'm not going to though. At this point I've relapsed enough to know that it will be nothing like that. And life isn't so bad right now. I'm being more social and more confident. I'm taking care of myself better and I am more motivated to get work done. 

Do any of you guys have using dreams? Does it cause cravings for you too? Seriously I didn't want to smoke again until I started having these dreams every single night. It's like weed is taunting me lol. Almost 18 days by the way.",2

I know it's probably the carts but I can't stop using them, primarily because they're easy to get (I live in CO) and life just feels better with them and sucks without them. Also, weed has never really stood in the way of my family, academic, or professional life (though it might be starting to). 

So I'm getting my college acceptance letters right now. The only school in CO I would want to go to is CU Boulder, and everywhere else I applied is in a prohibition state. I'm thinking it might be better to go out of state for college for my mental and physical health, but weed has always been great for me to help me become more social, extroverted, and positive.

I spotted a half smoked weed butt hiding in some dry dirt, just underneath my sit.

I started telling myself, 'I've been clean for almost a month which means it no longer controls me. If I light up that butt, I'll get a height. Ooh. It's just a butt. Ooh, I need that height, I miss how it feels n it feels so good. All I need is half a dose. It'll be so ecstatic.'

I curiously looked at that butt for five good minutes, still deliberating.

Then, I told myself, 'Wait a minute. I can smoke it if I want to. I'll get high and I'll feel goooood. Nobody's even watching me. But what will I tell my mates from r/leaves? That I relapsed? Hell no. I can lie that I'm still clean if I want to, but I can't afford to live with the guilt. I've come so far already. When I'm heading back home, all the neighbors will see my bloodshot eyes and will start wondering. My articulation will blur and everyone who knows the real me will say, he's done it again. Just for the short height from that butt? Hell no. And its in dirt. Who knows for how long its been sitting there and all the disease. Just for a high? Hell freaking NO!'

And that was it, I stood up and left the ghetto immediately.

Yey, I'm still clean. I did it, I did it, I did it, and it feels so gooooood. Haha.",36

I wanted to create this post to share my quitting experience with you all. I am currently on my 10th or 11th day without weed.

I stopped smoking because I caught the flu. Naturally did not want to smoke as I live in Canada and was not going to step out sick in this winter. I am glad I got sick.

Prior to getting sick, I was smoking about 2gs a day in spliffs for over a year.

My experience:

Day 1 - Did not feel anything. I believe because my mind was occupied with the sickness. I did think about smoking or anything in regards to it.

Day 2 - I noticed having hostile thoughts towards people. I was evaluating all my relationships and was naturally hating things about my friends, family, ex girlfriends, etc. 

Day 3 - Sweats, change in body temp, head ache. Still similar thoughts as day 2. Went to gym in the morning to shoot hoops.

Day 4 - Minor anxiety.. next to none. I started feeling depressed. Went to gym in the morning to shoot hoops.

Day 5 - Anhedonia set in. I did not want to do anything at all. I was not interested in eating, netflix, people.... like literally anything. All I wanted to do was be in my bed.

Day 6 - I cried. Felt good after. I felt lighter. I still was not interested in anything. Went to gym in the morning to shoot hoops.

Day 7 - Started to gain interest in food and watching stuff.

Day 8 - Things started to improve. I was thinking about work and sex again. Went to gym in the morning to shoot hoops.

Day 9 - This is where the game started changing. I started to build resentment towards weed. After reading Reddit and reflecting on my life, I realized what kind of a shit fuckin garbage drug this is. I am sure I will use THC again when I socialize down the line (months from now) after I achieve certain goals. But never from morning to night again. Once in 2 weeks when I party. I do not drink alcohol so having .3 -.4 of 20% ish thc oil does the trick for 2 or so hours for me.

Day 10 - I felt pretty good man. I feel aggressive, alert, and much better overall. Not consistently but in spurts. For the past week, I have stopped eating meat, only eggs. I have eliminated sugar. 

Day 11 - No desire to smoke weed. I feel gross thinking about it. I am so clear about what I am going to do next week. I feel like I wanna fuck the world that comes in my way now.

Yo listen. It's worth snapping out for 10 days. It's prespective. I am emotionally turned off by kush. It's seems like such a fukin looser thing to do now. I want to move further in life. It's only been 10 days or so. Fuck smoking. I am so glad I got sick. It's such a disgusting thought to think that I used to roll 10-15 pinners a day like a fucking low life. 

Btw I lost about 15 pounds in less than 2 weeks. Because of sickness and not eating shit. Also I did intermittent fasting as I did not want to eat so it made it easy. All I ate was breakfast.

I do seminal conservation as well. Currently on day 69. The benefits of that alone I have not reaped yet fully I feel because I have been high. I feel like a god rn. Dude I wrote this whole thing and now I wana punch through a wall I have so much energy haha!@#!@#@

Just quit it. It's worth it. The madness of withdrawls is pretty gangster. I will update again. Apologies for the lack of structurte of this post. I wanted to just write and write. I feel like I can write a book rn.

&#x200B;

Anyways I will update around 1 month again.

&#x200B;

TRUST ME. QUIT IT. This shit targets your rewards centre in the brain. Imagine being rewarded and feel achieved without doing shit. This is what weed does. Do this to an employee or your dog. He or she will turn into a pompous cunt who will justify the world.

I know im about to get it. Holy fuck thank you to the bitch that gave me this flu on newyears.",16

A joint doesn't work at all. Nothing works really anymore. I'm just numbed down by the drugs. And I'm not fucking sweating!!!!!!!!!! I'm eating a whole gram of RSO a fucking day.
I have a sweating conditon I've had forever that for some reason Marijuana completely fucking STOPS.

I have misophonia and BAD anger issues stemming from brain damage, Borderline personality disorder and Obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
Idk how to deal with anything without marijuana putting up a buffer. 
I need to start living a real fucking life. I want to go to school and have a job. I want to be sober and start working out I guess???? Saying that scares me. How the fuck do people operate sober? 
Please help I think all the edible abuse Im putting my body through is causing permanent damage. I feel like I need fucking rehab 😅

When I started smoking (cannabis) the only thing worth smoking was resin and unless you smoked it in a pipe you had to use it with tobbacco. I never liked it in a pipe as it was too harsh. I smoke rolling tobbacco so a joint or a single cannabis cigarette was my preference. Many's the time I would wake up in the morning and obviously as a smoker would crave nicotine but I would end up putting cannabis in it and waking and baking and then carry on like that for the rest of the day. I'm on day 17 of quitting but this time I have only stopped weed and apart from the odd day it's been easier than last time. I have still experienced occasional insomnia and night sweats in the first two weeks, apart from that its been reasonably smooth. Last time I stopped I cut out all my vices on the same day including caffiene and alcohol and went on a vape. For the first month or so I was a sleep deprived, sweating irritable angry son of a bitch.

I’ve been a lurker here for a while, I’ve been on and off joining this sub reddit for a while. But I think it’s time to commit to this. I’ve been dealing with a lot of depression lately and therefore my smoking has ticked up tremendously. I haven’t let it affect my work and it’s only when I come home that the cravings start. My partner has recently mostly stopped smoking. And while I am proud of him, it makes me more ashamed that I seemingly can’t. And there’s no resentment about it because I know that I too need to cut back, but it makes me feel like I have zero self control. I know the first weeks/months are the hardest so I guess I’m just here to say, it’s time. And I hope that I can lean on this community even though I have been in and out of this sub for a while. It’s dumb of me to think anyone but me noticed that I was subbed one week and un-subbed the next, but writing this out hopefully will help keep me subbed this time. Thanks for having this community to talk about something that many people don’t think is true.

How’s it goin?

Okay so to summarise, I’ve been smoking on and off for around a decade now. Last year I quit in January, and then in November I started smoking again. I’ve been smoking daily ever since. All it took was a little toke from a friend and I was instantly hooked. 

Addiction has been a problem of mine when it comes to weed. People say you can’t be addicted to weed but I know for a fact that’s bullshit. I am 100% an addict and I 100% wanna change that. 

I’ve bought some books on sobriety and quitting weed, but I’m just trying to be careful about the whole process. I like a drink, a couple of times a week. Last year when I quit weed, I ended up drinking day in day out instead of smoking. I had plenty to do, too. 

Gimme any tips, encouragement, opinions, motivational quotes, information, whatever you can give me to help me get the ball rolling. I’m cutting down the amount I put in my joints and have been for about a week now, and it’s significantly lowered compared to when I started, so I’m hoping to be down to just 1 a day in a few days. 

I love reading the posts in this community. You’re all so encouraging and supportive and helpful toward each other. It’s lovely.

I’m really inspired by everyone’s posts and I am looking forward to sharing my progress along the way. 

Thanks for reading! 😊",1

2020-01-12 02:08:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/enkf37/time_to_stop_smoking_starting_with_a_taper/,Time to stop smoking. Starting with a taper schedule.,"What’s up everyone!? First post here, hope y’all are having a fine morning/evening! Today marks the day I was supposed to stop smoking (I still have yet to today at 1 am).

But first - a little backstory. I’m 28 years young, been smoking daily for the most part since I was 15-16 years old. Mannn being a kid and smoking weed were some of the best times I ever had with my friends. Regardless, I have decided it is time to stop the habit!

As of yesterday, I was dabbing consistently 5-10 times a day. Mostly 3-5 times at night. Wake and bake too, daily! The last time I was sober from the ganj was two in a half years ago. I had a severe IV opiate addiction I admitted myself into inpatient rehab for. I have been sober over two years from that nightmare; however, I haven’t tackled sobriety from SOLELY marijuana since I was 18.  Aka I have no idea how the experience will be, as the opiate withdrawal was wayyy worse than any w/d I could have from stopping weed.

So today, I wanted to quit completely cold turkey, but it’s not imperative that I do. In that case, I wanted to document a day 1 taper for my own accountability, and hopefully to inspire and help others. I am taking a 6 month backpacking trip through Southeast Asia starting early March, and I would like to be a “normal person” without any w/d symptoms well before I leave. Being that I’ve conquered the devil himself in opiates, I know that I can push myself to limits beyond my wildest imagination. Some people may not be able to taper before the addict side kicks in and ruins progress, but I know I have the power to do so. Instead of being miserable the next few days, I plan to DRASTICALLY cut down my consumption for 5 days before jumping off completely.
Tonight I will take ONE dab.
Tomorrow I will switch to flower, consuming ONE bowl at night before bed. 
The next three days, I will take ONE hit of flower right before bedtime. 
And on day 6, I will update with daily journals of how I feel, what my struggles were, etc.
Any questions/comments/well-wishings would be appreciate, and I will try to answer everyone!

NIGHT OF DAY 2.. I had to work (I’m a server) and while I was there, could NOT stop thinking about how much I wanted to smoke, I had just a depressed feeling I was (not like woe is me I want to kill myself). More of just, the shittyness of my stomach aching, and me not feeling as energetic as usual.. I smoked a bowl this evening, and it didn’t do too much for me. I managed to put down a smoothie earlier and some chips/ramen noodles tonight. I can already tell sleep will be difficult. I can make it, but if that bowl won’t help me sleep tonight, I wont even worry about the next two nights of taking one puny little hit. If you’re gonna taper, it shouldn’t be a drastic 2-3 day taper. You’d want to start cutting back to where it’s not as uncomfortable, over a short period of two weeks maybe. Anyways, my hands and feet have been sweating and clammy, no headaches or chills. Burping and rumbling stomach, slight annoyance at my lazy coworkers (usually the same when I’m high anyways haha) but just kind of out of it. Very tolerable, though. We’ll see how sleep goes tonight. Updates tomorrow! Hope anyone is even reading this!

EDIT 1/ Update - I slept well the night I smoked my bowl two nights ago. Got about five hours before my alarm for work went off. ZERO appetite. Smoothies are excellent, though if you aren’t hungry for solid foods. I serve food at a busy restaurant and had to work a double - I felt empty inside and very lethargic, but I kept reminding myself I’m a beast and it’s all in my head. Hands were clammy towards the end of the day. Feet were sweating most of the nighttime. My stomach was grumbling, and I was burping all day. I’d say 2/10 of stomach pain. After dragging through the day/night, I decided to not take the “one hit of weed” purely bc I am tired of feeling that empty depressed feeling and want it to be over ASAP. Nothing to be afraid of though as far as symptoms go.. tolerable for sure but it does suck. If you want to taper, you need to give it more than a few days. Probably cut back over a week period to where you’re not uncomfortable. Definitely don’t do the drastic drop off. 

Got home last night and laid in bed until 8 am watching mountain climbing/solo climbing movies and videos on YouTube. It’s 5 pm now, I have to be at work at 3 pm every day.. probably got about an hour combined of sleep, but I’m feeling excellent today. Stomach isn’t quite as grumbly, managed to eat a full sandwich pretty easily and could eat more if I wanted to. Noticed already an increase in my mood. Just kind of feels weird not smoking.. like I’m missing something or should be feeling a certain way. Gotta find a way to block out that feeling of not having something. I will probably start at a gym soon. I am still getting hot flashes and slightly sweating today. Lost a little weight from having the flu and then stopping dabbing right afterwards. Don’t be nervous about quitting cold turkey. Not hard except for the first two days all I could think about was weed weed weed weed haha. No nightmares yet! Excited for them to come around! Day 2, no weed - so far so good. To be continued ya bishes!

EDIT 2: Since nobody is keeping up, I will keep it short and sweet. Day 4 I got my appetite back. I felt some stomach pains at certain parts of the day. Also felt the craving urge to smoke when I was bored after work and during my break. I just feel as if I should feel different than at stasis. I’m so used to being inebriated in some way shape or form.
Day 5 has been better also. I have a lot of energy, and I even ate breakfast for the first time in a long time! I finally had my first INSANE dream. It’s crazy how real they seem.. luckily not a nightmare. I’m stoked about my life at the moment, and am on the pink cloud, as they say. I am proud of myself for the progress. I would say to anyone who wants to stop smoking, GO FOR IT.  Just empty your house of everything and go too far to turn back. Don’t give yourself the outlet to mess up. The feeling of happiness and wellness I am experiencing keeps me going. Again, it’s super weird to not be feeling a certain way. Crazy I used to not be happy with myself without being high. Dependency issues...

2020-01-12 01:43:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/enk7b5/everyone_here_should_watch_click_on_netflix/,Everyone here should watch Click on Netflix,"Hey guys,

I've been a smoker for about 12 years now and just recently watched this movie again tonight with my family. I've been struggling with quitting pot over the last 3 years now, going on and off and I really feel like this movie captured exactly how I currently feel about the process and where I am now.

So before I start rambling on, I really encourage ya'll to watch the movie first and make your own analysis of it. Then you can read what I'm about to say because it includes a ton of spoilers.

\-------------------------------

With that being said, here's my take:

All of us weed addicts are the main character, Michael Newman (Adam Sandler). Just like him, we had our life before we met weed. We went through the ups and downs and dealt with it accordingly. All of a sudden, we get this new element introduced in our life. The remote + fast-forward or in our case weed.

This new-found element is so god damn cool in the beginning. It is an enhancer to our lives and we love it. Stressed from work? Smoke/fast-forward and you'll get through it. Relationship problems? Smoke :)! Family? Money? Smoke :)! Things that we thought we couldn't get through, we simply didn't have to anymore. Just like Adam Sandler and the remote, we fast forward through all of it by smoking. And as a result? We don't have to deal with any of the emotional turmoil or stress at all! WOOT! THIS IS FANTASTIC!

Because it's so awesome, we keep doing it. Smoke, smoke, smoke, fast-forward, fast-foward, fast-forward, and all of a sudden you find yourself smoking/fast-forwarding through everything. Simple things like showers, sickness and whatever minor troubles of life can all be solved through weed and clicking the fast-forward on the remote. It's just so god damn easy. You just want to feel good and not deal with any of that bullshit. The weed is such a great tool! Taking away all of the bad and just letting me experience what I want to experience. Life is now so much fucking easier.

As time passes and you get used to having this remote/weed, it starts becoming habitual. It starts learning your tendencies. A quote from the movie, ""lie to me, lie to your wife, lie to yourself but you can't lie to the remote"". You can't lie to weed. Through time and use, it has become a part of you and learned your behaviors. It knows that when you're stressed from work, it's time to fast forward (smoke). It knows that when you feel shitty about school and your relationship that it's time to fast forward again and hit that bong. It gets to a point where we don't even want to click the fast-forward button anymore. We don't want the high but it happens anyway because we are addicted and it has become ingrained as a deep-rooted habit. It really sneaks up on you and you don't even realize it's happening. 

That's just one part of it. The other is the dreaded autopilot. When we have smoked so much and for so long, it's not an epic high anymore. It never is. Our high degrades into a numbing agent. We potato out and life loses its color. We are alive but are merely shells of ourselves. Much like how the movie shows Adam Sandler when he hits the fast-forward button. ""The lights are on, but nobody's at home."" And that's exactly how we like it. That way, we don't have to deal with shit but are still getting past it. 

This is where it gets fucking dangerous. Because like the movie. We start going from 90% life - 10% autopilot to 90% autopilot and 10% life. The weed and remote have become such a habitual escape that we are simply not really experiencing life anymore, just autopiloting through it. We start abusing weed for so long that months and years start to pass by while you are in a haze. You start feeling lost and scared every time you come down from a high because you wake up not knowing where you are, what you're doing and what you're purpose is because you've been fucking baked this entire time and are simply never present. 

Eventually, every one of us in this sub like the main character gets to a tipping point which is near the end of the movie. We realize that we simply don't want to live life this way anymore and want to experience all of it. We become scared of the next high/fast-forward and want it to stop so bad because we want to be present. We want to connect with our families, friends, the world and all that it has to offer. We have missed so much and have seen the destruction it causes to our relationships and our lives. We keep throwing the remote/bud away only for it to show up again and hate ourselves for what we have become because of it. We just want things to change. We NEED it to change.

That screaming feeling of ""this has to end"" brings this subreddit and me to where we are at now. Here in this sub, every one of you is doing what Adam Sandler is doing in the final hospital scene. We are ripping off all the things that keep us connected and alive to our past autopilot dependent self. We are taking the hardest step in trying to change. We are Adam Sandler chasing after his son, desperately trying to relay the message of ""love"". He actually says family in the movie.... but for me, it's really a message about love. He wants his son not to do what he did and autopilot his entire life. He wants him to be present. To connect with the people he loves instead of shelving them, feelings, and himself away. Here in this subreddit, as brothers and sisters, we prove every time we visit, read posts, comment and engage, that we just want that for each other and for ourselves.

I truly believe that all of us, like the main character, have all been given a second chance. Something sparked inside each and every one of us. A feeling of ""enough is enough, I'm going to look for help and solutions to change my life for the better"" and really do it. Hence why ya'll are with me fighting the good fight on this subreddit. 

To end, I quote ""Good guys need a break, I know you'll do the right thing this time"". So dump the remote and dump the weed. We've seen the other side already and it's not fucking pretty. It's time to actually live life and embrace it. You won't regret it. 

Love you all. FIGHTING!!!

2020-01-12 01:19:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/enjzgq/progress_3_months_out/,Progress 3 months out,"Just wanted to give an encouraging update for anyone who cares to read it. I've been (mostly) clean for 3 months and counting now after a 4 year daily habit. I smoked a bit over New Years break while I was visiting old friends. I guess that broke my ""streak"", but that's not the way I look at it. I think it's an important reminder that its not some number of days that matters, its the changing lifestyle and habits. 

Also (and I don't want to sound like I'm tooting my own horn here, this journey is different for everyone), I really hit my stride and didn't look back after the first few days of quitting. No compulsive desires to smoke. I felt comfortable smoking a bit with friends, knowing I was only going to do it over the break. This might not work for everyone, but it gives me a lot of confidence knowing that one puff didn't send me on another downward spiral. 

Other than a few days over the break where I shared a joint with friends, I've been completely clean from weed for 3 months, and I reconnected with the wonderful girl I complained about giving up on/not appreciating because I was high in my first post. She's noticed the change in me, and she's encouraging me to stay sober. The support is really nice to have. I'm very lucky to have someone that amazing in my life.

I don't have any sage advice to add, except that you should keep truckin'! The stoner me (still haven't gotten comfortable conceiving of myself as a stoner, but that's absolutely what I was) would have told myself that these improvements weren't worth giving up weed for, but sober me knows they totally are.

The first 5 days were fine, but then all of a sudden they came on. I remember last nights nightmare (which involved my University business teacher and a paranormal schoolgirl.. don't ask) but they're so vivid it's ridiculous. I remember walking into the loft (in the dream) and noticing a tiny rocking chair, gently rocking back and fourth. I went over to it, raised my hand and felt a demonic force push against it (it's giving me shivers just writing this down). Eventually the paranormal aspect of the dream got worse and it woke me up, but that was last night... It's just gone 2am and I'm literally scared to go to sleep.

The day before I had TWO separate nightmares, both waking me up. The first involved my girlfriend crashing her car after I told her to slow down, then the next dream involved me standing on top of a wooden castle in a fun-fair which was slowly getting burned down and I had to try and save myself from the top. Again, this woke me up in a horrible panic.

Has anybody else been experiencing dreams similar to this and if so, is there any tips or suggestions for helping them and going to sleep?

Someone on this thread once said something that resonated with me. Weed doesn’t just dull the bad feelings, it dulls the good ones. In order to be truly happy you have to deal with the bad no matter how impossible it feels sometimes.

Pot was my couch, my safe zone, my blanket to huddle in to temporarily escape my stresses and anxieties about my life, future, social life, and the world. It was so deeply comforting, peaceful, magical even, to get stoned. Suddenly I felt I could handle it all. My problems shrank in my mind. And as long as I was high, I could keep not caring.

Now sober for 2 days, feelings hit like a train. All the discomfort I have avoided with pot is here now, saying “I’m still here! You still have to deal with me!” 

I used to smoke these feelings away under the guise of getting a ‘better’ and ‘calmer’ perspective on things. But I know deep down - and who here can relate? - that weed did not get rid of my problems. It MASKED them. And soon it became a lifestyle. Though I didn’t realize it while smoking, I was running from life every day. Running from life to the ‘safe’ arms of pot smoke and my private world. I don’t want to live my life on the run.

It has been hard for me to reconcile the good times I’ve had with pot with all of its destructive manifestations in my life. How do you guys deal with this?

Of course I started googling and that's always terrifying ..swollen lymph nodes can be a symptom of lymphoma. 
I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced similar side effects post quitting ? Any weird, unexpected physical side effects ?

Maybe my immune system is reacting to the absence of THC and that's why my lymph node is swollen.

For some background: I've been smoking daily from a bong for the last 10years, female in my 30s. It's the first time I ever quit. The cravings are tolerable, sleepless nights and lots of mood swings.

I have became a lazy, paranoid, fogged out, fat, un-creative fucking disgusting pig shitty excuse of a human being because I cared about getting stoned every day more than anything else. I've spent easily $200,000 to $300,000 on this stupid plant just to freeze myself in time and never evolve or change. I'm nearly skint broke because all my money went to pot constantly. The saddest part is that it wasn't until early 2020 I've actually realized how much damage pot has done to my entire life. The fog is the worst thing ever. Ever other drug after a day or two at max a week, even when your an addict you feel sober again. Not Marijuana, it sticks to you like herpes because it binds to your fat cells and I feel stoned constantly even when sober for over a week.

Its time for me to pay the piper. I had to close an overdrawn bank account because we made a false fraud case when most of the Non-Citibank ATM withdrawals were simply me buying Cannabis in psychotic amounts. I don't even remember what I liked about Cannabis anymore, whatever benefits it once had are long gone because I have no concept of moderation, and never will. I will always be an addict, even abstinent for the rest of my life and sadly it took until 2020 to truly accept that as a fact. I'm determined to change, as the idea of doing any drugs EVER again disgusts me, I never want to be this sad, strung-out hopeless mess of a human being that I have become ever again.",12

I find this all very embarrassing. I am a successful grown up professional and parent who started smoking to sleep and now can't quit. I have quit before but I have thought in the past I could just use a tiny bit and it wouldn't be a problem. I know better now. I have been tapering because I am scared/anxious to quit entirely and for the last week have been vaping just a tiny bit - seriously two three hits at night max and am extremely depressed and anxious. I am having a hard time figuring out if there is something really wrong that I need to take care of or if this slow reduction in the amount of weed is wreaking havoc. The second or third day I felt great, then the fourth and fifth day I am truly miserable. Is that withdrawal or ... reality? It is so hard to know. I don't want to smoke and am not actually tempted to during the day but I am not sure I can handle the depression if it lasts longer .....",4

I feel anxious, bored, uncertain, emotionally raw and just really on edge. This has been a difficult week because of other personal stuff that has been going on in my life, but quitting weed has just made it that much more difficult.

Despite this overwhelming feeling of ""blah-ness"", I don't want to smoke. I don't even feel tempted to do so. I know that as soon as I did I would regret it. It would be nothing but a trick I was playing on myself. It would create the illusion that all of these feelings don't exist, that my problems don't exist. They do exist, though. Weed would just mask them and keep me in that same hell that I had been in for the longest time.

I don't know if quitting smoking is *the* answer, but I know it's not conducive to everything I have going on right now.

So today I'll just feel everything. If I'm bored, I'll be bored. If I'm angry, I'll be angry. I accept all of this as part of the process. The only way out is through.",7

That was due to a combination of factors, and I'm not beating myself up for it. I'm glad to say that yesterday I didn't smoke, and I also didn't struggle much with not smoking -- more and more I'm realizing that my stoner existence is something that belongs to a previous stage in my development, and when I'm taking good care of myself, I feel that urge to smoke growing weaker all the time.

Something u/ExoticSpecific said in a reply to that post set me thinking. The tl;dr version of their comment was basically that it's not so much about how much of a streak you can rack up without smoking, but rather the big structural changes you're making in your life and your mindset beneath it all. I'm totally on board with that. My obsession with will-I-or-won't-I-smoke-today has become by far the most harmful part of my relationship with marijuana, and convincing myself that every time I smoke the clock gets reset to day 1 just encourages that obsessive thinking.

I, like many of you, haven't been on 'day 1' for a very long time now. In the last two years I've quit, relapsed, been sober for a couple weeks or months, gone back to heavy all-day smoking, and repeated the cycle all over again. But every good decision I've made along the way and every new insight I've developed -- during those sober streaks as well as during the periods of heavy use -- are cumulatively building towards something new. To call it ""day 1 again"" is a huge disservice to all the work we've put into our journeys so far.

I'm still using the I Am Sober app, because idk, I get something out of it, can't quite say what. But from now on I'm going to try to think less in days and streaks, and more in moments and personal growth. Maybe this is a shift of mindset that will be helpful for some of you too.",2

2020-01-11 08:38:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/en7i3m/finally_quitting/,Finally Quitting,"I started smoking weed at 18. I was introduced to it by my friend and her family, who all smoked. I was in a bad environment at home and in life in general, and I loved the support/inclusion I got from them. 

From 18 to nearly 21 (current) I smoked daily, aside from a one month break last year. 
At some point last year, I recognized there was ap problem but convinced myself I needed it for sleep, depression, anxiety, etc. I was also struggling with anorexia, and I found that I could pass the time and forget being hungry. I would avoid going out with my friends to stay in the comfort of my room getting stoned and watching tv. I never mentioned it to my therapist. 

October and november of this year I seriously struggled with binging at night when I was stoned. I told myself it's the anorexia,  binging is normal etc. But it was daily, and only when I smoked. I would wake up in the morning feeling like shit, vowing to not binge. And then I would smoke and I would inhale a pack of cookies, 3 chocolate bars, popcorn, bags of chips, you name it. It created so much anxiety. I didnt know how to get out of the cycle. 

Over the past winter break, I didnt smoke for a week. I was happy. I didnt crave it. And I actually slept fine (although, I was with my gf and she always helps me relax and fall asleep). I wasnt binging. I figured i may as well continue this trend, right? 

I get back to my apartment, and the first fucking thing i do is smoke, because it's there. I spent 3 nights smoking and binging. I realized how shitty I felt, the brain fog, the anxiety and guilt I was feeling  about smoking. I knew it was no longer beneficial for me like it was at 18.

So, I threw it all away. 

The next night, i checked my grinder. No weed, but had kief. So I got stoned  

I was fed up, and chucked my grinder 

I went a night without smoking, used s melatonin to help me sleep. 

Last night, I really couldn't sleep and had some 1/1 edible that I ate, it didnt get me high but I feel the CBD helped me relax. 

I woke up without brain fog, but I still feel very guilty. I want to stop.  And I'm going to. It's a little bit of a bumpy road but I dont envision myself being a stoner all my life. It served its purpose. And it's me that's the problem, not the cannabis. I have s very addictive personality, whether it be caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol. I dont drink anymore because I cant just have one. I can do the same with weed. 

I guess I'm posting this because i want accountability and for it to be official. I may chuck the edibles I have even though it ""doesnt really do anything"" yet i still took it.",3

I've been smoking almost everyday for 3 years (I started 5 years ago) and I tried sooo many times to quit, but I never managed to get to this point. This morning I had a moment of weakness because I'm actually having a rough time and I thought that a joint would help me through this, but then I realised that it was the way I managed problems in my life for all this years, and now it's time to face them and solve them once and for all.

I've never been this productive in my life: studying 8 hours a day, spending free time with my friends, having the time of my life with my gf. All this things remind me that being high is not everything, and even if it feels really good to stay home smoking blunts and watching movies in my sweet comfort-zone, there is a world out there that, trust me, you can experience at its finest even if you are sober (also, being high sometimes ruined it for me).

I love that I found a support group like this. There are so many people that are struggling with their addiction and every one of you guys should feel good just because you are trying to make your life a little bit better. I think that reading a stranger's story about how quitting was beneficial for him could help everyone stay focused on their goal, so that's mine (for now).

Probably to forget something or to be able to feel less for a moment. 
Ofcourse you think you’re happy during this just because it’s better than suffering.
But the thing is, overtime you’re focus when you’re not high will fade, it feels foggy in your head and most things that happen to you don’t matter. Highlight of the day is when your high. Everday. You become miserable in real life. But the only one who can really see it is you.",6

I am a 30 year old long-term smoker, roughly from around 21. So 9 years of almost daily smoking. 

I have never had a problem with anxiety or panic attacks, but in the last 6 months I have been trying and failing to stop smoking. 

It all came to a head on New Year's Eve, I had a smoke as normal and it induced a huge panic attack. I ended up at A&E as I thought it was my heart but the ECG etc were completely fine, so all indicators point to panic attack. 

Since then, if I smoke even a tiny bit of weed it brings back the feeling (although not as intense as NYE), has anyone else experienced this? It's as if my brain has flipped a switch after so long and said 'that's enough, I'm going to make this as uncomfortable as possible for you to continue'. I've seen many others reporting similar things, but all in threads years old.

I haven't smoked for a couple of days now but still feeling a bit of tightness in my chest on occasion, if anyone has gone through similar - How did you deal with it? How long of non-smoking will it take for me to go back to 'normal' and the panic/anxiety to subside, and is there anything I can do to help the process along? 

Thanks guys.",10

It’s 4am EST here for me I haven’t smoked since Jan 5th. It’s been great so far I’m following my routine and just taking it one day at a time.

One thing I’ve noticed though is my sleep is utterly f**ked. For instance I went to bed around  12am and have been up since  2:30am this has been going on since I stopped smoking, I’ve not been sleeping properly. I’ve read that this usually happens when you stop smoking.

My questions are how much longer will I have to deal with this? Any tips to make it easier on myself? 

P.S: I’m grateful this is happening though cause it lets me know I’m on the road to recovery. Keep pushing everyone we can do this!

I took my dog for a walk and decided that this is going to be the day I'm starting my new chapter.
I have been sorting through some journals and sketchbooks of mine from the last 2 years and it has been a journey...
exactly a year ago I made a contract with myself, I wrote it down, saying that I don't want to smoke anymore. and this lasted 2 hours. I relapsed immediately. I also looked through my journal and forgot that my relationship was already fucked back then.
so fast forward to today I'm single because he left and I quit smoking. I have a feeling this had to be the way it goes down.
I had to be hurt and shattered this way.
I want to share with you my journey to some knowledge I gained that led me to therapy and an episode of taking antidepressants.
I have been anxious my whole life as I'm pretty scattered and not grounded at all due to countless resettlement. my parents left poland for good when I was a child and I grew up in germany, then moved to another country, in which I live now.
as a teenager I started to read into psychology, it was a big craving of mine to understand the fucked up minds of hoomans and the reasons my parents acted the way they did.
I didn't want to study it, I'd rather go to work to make an independent life on my own possible.
I later tipped my toes into spirituality a bit. I'm a pretty rational being, but in some phases of my life I started to appreciate some different, holistic approaches to my problems.
so I read self help books and listened to TED talks and podcasts with interesting humans. I came across some really essential ones for me, which I want to share with you as they do help me a lot.

- Eckhart Tolle - this guy taught me about the power of now. being in the moment, not in the present or past

- Amanda Palmer - she wrote a book about asking for help

- Johann Hari - this guy opened my eyes about reconnection to myself. I read his book ""Lost Connections - Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression""

those are my 3 most precious picks of people, that helped me to understand myself a bit better.

what I want to say is that, you are not alone. this sub is already bringing people together and I am glad that I found you here, the amount of support is heartwarming.
there are ways that could help you get through this, you don't have to do it all alone.
I decided to get some help and I'm doing therapy, 2 years ago I hit rock-bottom and went to see a psychiatrist. I took some meds that helped me for a year and then the side effects ate me alive so I stopped. I'm to sensitive to meds. 

I also did some research about suplements that could help me get through this. I suffer from PMS with mild depressive episodes and anxiety every month. I know that it's connected to hormonal imbalance and now with quitting the weed, I will try taking some magnesium, vitamin b6, vitex agnus-castus and st. johnswort supplements. 

(I have to add that especially with st. johnswort you really need to be careful with counter effects with other meds, it's acting like a mild antidepressant, that's also helping with my neurodermitis. it also messes with contraception, so be careful!)

I don't want to state that it's good to rush from one substance to another (or several) but that there are ways and techniques (meditation!) that can really support you with some of the worst symptoms. 

thanks for taking the time to read this, I'm sending you all a virtual hug and you got this!",4

If you are struggling in your early days, please push through. I have been through it all before (in my past attempts), this time I just got lucky. I am nowhere near out of the woods yet, I am cautiously optimistic.

I only smoked maybe 2-4 times a month. At 24.5 years old I started smoking it every night because I noticed it help me fall asleep quickly and I just liked getting high and playing video games at the end of my day. I smoked everyday 1-3 times (pipe, bong, or joint) a day for 2 years up until July 2019, with only a two week break when I went on vacation with my gf. In July I got really sick and took a month break because I was afraid weed might be causing it. 

I ended up testing positive for Lyme Disease and was on strong antibiotics for that month to recover. I didn't smoke weed for a full month and the only withdrawal symptoms I had was insomnia, night sweats, and no appetite for a week or two (also side effects of my antibiotics). It was very easy to handle and I really didn't get many cravings.

After that month I wanted to keep using weed but decided to try a healthier way than smoking, and bought a dry herb vape the Arizer Solo 2. It was amazing! I would get super high without coughing or irritating my throat and I would barely cough up mucus in the mornings. I thought it was the greatest thing ever. 

I vaped weed 2-4 times a day for the past 5 months and in December I was pretty much high all day everyday because I was on break from classes and I can easily function at work while stoned.  However I've come to realize that weed has been really negatively effecting my life, my relationship with my beautiful amazing gf, my motivation, and my productivity. After a week or two of arguing with myself every time I got high I finally decided to quit last weekend and be done with it. 

Day 1 was okay besides some jitters and a little anxiety and of course I didn't sleep great.

Day 2 was hell on Earth. I've never suffered from anxiety before in my life and it just crippled me from the second I woke up. So nauseated just from my anxiety I could barely eat all day and I threw up my dinner about an hour after I forced it down. (Never vomited from weed or withdrawals before). Then i didn't sleep too great, probably in and out for 5-6 hours.

Day 3 was a bit better than day 2 and I had a little less anxiety and I was feeling more positive and clear headed. However, the morning and night was still pretty rough with anxiety. I have no gained so much respect for people who deal with anxiety on a regular basis. Didn't sleep great again, another 5-6 hours in and out.

Day 4 again seemed like I was slightly improving, was able to eat a bit more food and deal with the anxiety until it was time to go to sleep. I really struggled to be able to lay down and not feel super suck to my stomach from the anxiety. It was also my worst night of sleep so far, only getting like 3 hours

Day 5 might have been my worst day yet, except I haven't vomited since that one time on night 2. Crippled by anxiety at random intervals throughout the day plus periods of feeling super depressed like I couldn't even get off the couch. Only getting 3 hours of sleep I think also really affected me. However I have noticed my appetite being a little bit better each day, I finally was able to stomach snacking on so e peanuts throughout the day. Anxiety is starting to peak again though as my bedtime approaches.

On both the other times I took breaks (two weeks, and 1 month) I never felt this anxiety or depression and I'm only 5 days into actually quitting. I've lost 10 lbs this week of weight I can not afford to lose. I've been forcing myself to the gym everyday so far which has helped me feel decent for a few hours. But it also drains me so much since I've barely been eating or sleeping. I honestly wonder if the dry herb vape is the reason my withdrawals are so fucking bad. My friend also quit with me on the same day and he has smoked weed everyday for the past 8 years and a lot more weed than me each day and he is having no issues besides being cranky and no appetite. However he only took bong hits where the past 5 months I've pretty much only Vaped. The other weird thing is that I haven't gotten any night sweats, even though usually that's my worst symptom when I take a break. 

I am so proud of myself for quitting and taking this step towards a better future. I honestly have no cravings to get high but that might be because I feel so fucking terrible all the time. 

Just felt like I needed to out this out here for myself and maybe for others to read. I'm committed to quitting and can't wait to start feeling better. I just hope it's soon because I start classes full time again on Monday and I need to get back to work. I just wish this anxiety wasn't so crazy.

TLDR: on day 5 and anxiety has been the real killer for me. I wonder if dry herb vaping makes the withdrawals worse than smoking because I'm suffering much worse than my friend who smoked a lot more and a lot longer than me?",11

I am only able to reach full deep breaths 25% of the time. I'm wondering if there's any way to make breathing easier, or if the shortness of breath goes away soon.

I’m a 38 year old woman and part of what slowly got me into very regular smoking is that my monthly periods are mostly horrifying. Terrible cramps, night sweats, bad depression etc.  Part of why I’m quitting is that I feel like weed no longer really helps with those things and, in fact, maybe makes my symptoms worse. 
That said, things were extra crazy in my body yesterday on day 2 of my cycle (I’m assuming from intense detox) and, as the night got later, I began to panic. Cramps were banging, and bleeding was scary heavy. My body was soaked with sweat. I had an important morning at work this morning, and knew that if I didn’t calm my body and sleep, I wouldn’t make it. Night sweats I can handle, but combined w the rest = too much. So I decided to smoke. 
I took 1 hit, and let it settle in, just to see.. Immediately my heartbeat slowed and I stopped sweating. I had a couple more hits and went to bed. Slept amazing. I woke in the night as it was wearing off and night sweats were kicking in, smoked a little more, and slept. I’ll do the same tonight to push me through my work day, and then continue w my quit journey tomorrow. 
I actually feel ok with this decision, but I wanted to share here so that I know I’m honestly showing up and holding myself accountable to this group. I think my body just needed a little ease from the detox for a minute, and right now that feels like balance. 
To any of you who feel tempted to relapse, tho, stay strong! I’m right back on the wagon tomorrow, just maybe with a little more grace for myself. It’s absolutely worth it to quit, I can really feel that!",11

Quiting weed has been one of the hardest things I've done a million times. I've been a daily smoker for almost 7 years, but even as far back as 2 years ago, I just stopped enjoying it. Yet I still couldn't stop smoking. Everytime I got high I would just isolate myself combined with a nonstop loop about how I need to stop smoking + anxiety about other things. 

I would try and quit at times for a week or two if I was lucky but would always find a reason to come back. 

For about a month nearly every single night was my last night smoking. ""Fuck this shit. I'm done for good."" And then of course I would do the same thing the next night. Every time feeling like a more pathetic loser for not being able to kick something as ""harmless"" as weed. Somedays I would make it to day two. Then whats the thought? ""Damn dude you went one day, you deserve a joint."" It's so crazy how we can consistently trick ourselves even though it makes zero sense. And so on and so on. 

Recently I got let go from a job (not weed related) and I was able to clean up for over a month! After a week things were a breeze. Yet as soon as I got a job. Time to celebrate! Just like that, daily smoking once again. I knew I needed to get clean again as my job was only seasonal yet I didn't care. But I knew I would have to quit to find another job. Hence the day 1 cycle continues. But now that it's been a few weeks along with the motivation of the new year, I'm on day 2. Even if I find a job I'm determined to stay clean as long as I can from weed. It's going to be tough now that its legal but I'll figure something out.

But fuck man. It's like, I wasn't hospitalized for a week because I have heartburn. I wasn't hospitalized because I have acid reflux disease. Prilosec isn't going to cut it. 

And I have to admit the thought of going to a dispensary flashed through my mind.

If i drink i never go back to it the next day, i can handle it, but do you think drinking occasionally and responsibly without abuse will fade this clarity?

Last night I smoked weed in a lucid dream. If you arent sure what a lucid dream is, it is a dream in which you are aware that you are dreaming.  In my dream I was sitting in my old bedroom from 5-6 years ago with a bong next to me, packed and ready to go. I had this urge to take a hit even though I had been doing good with my sobriety, and let me tell you, it was a very strong surge of emotions. At the point in the dream when I took the hit, I did not know that I was dreaming. I was at first feeling the familiar high and then immediately afterwards, I had this huge rush of regret and felt absolutely awful for what I had going for me with my sobriety. Amidst all these thoughts, I had a thought of doing a reality check (a way to check in a dream that you are dreaming) and realized I was dreaming, and just like that I was ""sobered"" up again, waking up shortly afterwards. 

When I woke up, there was a huge wave of relief that I had not actually smoked. It felt almost satisfying smoking in the dream and ""imagining"" the high, for lack of a better term, and waking up knowing that I was still trucking along. This brought me to thinking that this could possibly help other people out, as I had no idea of doing this on purpose to aid in quitting. So far im goin 13 days strong :) If you want more information on lucid dreaming, check out r/LucidDreaming

This weekend I'm helping throw a big milestone birthday party for one of my very best friends. we went to college together, and have stayed close for the decade+ since then, though we now live in different cities. we have always smoked together for as long as I can remember. some of my fondest memories are of burn rides with her (sry -- was before people were more vocal about not smoking & driving), and of walking around or just sitting in her room, chatting and passing a joint back and forth after a long study session. another dear, longtime friend of ours who is also a mega stoner is coming to visit from a different city as well. I haven't told either of them that I'm trying to stop (I've made it to day 6 now; not the longest streak in the world but still). I know I should just talk to them, but I'm .... embarrassed? they are supportive, loving, long-time friends of mine who I know won't break my balls too much, but ... yeah. I just can't get over that squirmy feeling of being a little embarrassed. I'm now a full-grown adult but I can't shake the feeling of, ""but my friends will think I'm a looooooserrrr!!!!"" ugh.

Even if this isn't rational, in my heart, me saying, ""I've quit smoking weed"" feels about the same as me saying I'm now a devout evangelical who will only have sex through a sheet-hole while singing the hymns. I realized while typing this that I also don't want to make it seem like I'm judging them either.

This is the billionth time I quit (day 6), with my longest streak of 4 months in the last 11 years. Im 26, successful job, and in good health. But I have been plagued and poisoned by weed for far too long.. this is my addiction

I smoked an ounce every 5-6 days. I venmo’d my dealer or pulled cash from my credit card when I ran thru my paychecks. I constantly lived beyond my budget and didnt care. I went to bed every single night telling myself I was done smoking.. only to wake up and immediately smoke. I work from home, and recently relocated to a new state. I have no friends here, and roll the weed in blunts to face alone. Im probably 30 pounds under weight, with severe black eye surroundings and cheek bones poking way out. Ive really started to wear my addiction.

Quitting is never easy. The nightmares never go away (practically daily), and it takes almost 3 weeks for a solid appetite to come together. Irritable isnt even the right word (Ive already blocked basically any remaining contact Ive had), and all my relationships (gfs included) are torn. The only thing Ive been able to keep is my job, which somehow has been pretty successful. This only means more money and less incurring debt.

When Id get high, I avoid everything and anyone, and can only think about quitting. Ive recognized my addiction a long time ago, yet always run back. Its safe there... and I tell myself Im ok with being alone because I have weed. 

I have no direction with this story, but this is my experiences. I still have the quitters high, but the nightmares are really kicking in and I can feel the cravings creeping up. Loneliness cant begin to explain the nights, and Ive pushed everyone too far to talk to... yet, Im still pushing. I remember the 4 months, I remember the fog being lifted and the personality returning.. I remember the hope that maybe, I was healing and that it wasnt too late for me.

I hope this helps someone out there that really fell apart from weed. I used to be addicted to everything and anything, only to find myself nowadays too hungover the next day to continue abusing any substance other than weed. I always wanted weed, always needed it.",20

Today started much the same as yesterday. I still feel very anxious and sad in the morning. On a more positive note, I slept much better last night. I can't even remember last time I had a dream, but for the last week my dreams have been extremely vivid and melancholy. Each one has been set in my hometown (which I have now left) and involve my family or gf... and weed always features in them too.

As the day progressed I just completely lost motivation and ended up sitting on my arse and watching Netflix not even really enjoying what I was watching. I just feel so flat today. I'm just looking for things to kill time before I can go to bed again and cross another day off the calendar. The constant rain for the last 2 days isn't really helping either.

It IS getting easier though. I'm less irritable and frustrated today. The cravings passed several days ago so I'm not twitching to contact my dealer anymore. I definitely feel less foggy today, but my concentration and short term memory are still an issue. I'm finding it really difficult to complete complex tasks such as paperwork or anything that involves too many numbers.

Things are moving in the right direction though. I hoping by the start of next week I will have turned a corner with this. I have to start classes again on Monday, and although I really enjoy them, I'm kinda dreading it. The course I am on involves a lot of class participation (it's a language course) and I have a feeling I'm gonna be pretty useless and embarrass myself for the next few weeks. People in my class are cool though so I know it won't be a huge problem. I'm hoping that once the worst of this is over I'll actually be able to retain some of the knowledge I have leaned in class. I often forget everything the second I walk out the classroom door... almost certainly due to the fact that I'm still high from the night before.

Signs are good. Things ARE getting easier and it WILL be worth it in the long run

Started in high school off snd on through college and after. Around 23 when i got my own place after college i began smoking everyday and has gone on pretty consistently for the last 7 years. 

I am becoming a dad in the near future and am excited about this new adventure in life, but I have also recently been “diagnosed” with CHS after visiting the ER two times in a week about 3 months ago. I had all the classic CHS symptoms and hot showers would help temporarily.  I am in a position where i know I need to quit and cold turkey is probably the best option. Does anyone out there have experience with CHS and quitting weed? Any methods, tips or advice on how to taper off or alleviate symptoms as mine have only come up once i abstain from smoking?

I was a heavy dab user for 2 years, bud before that and such. Yesterday was a huge milestone for me. I was able to cut it down to only 3 very miniscule sessions compared to 8-10 times a day 4 dabs each time. Not to mention occasional extended use I won't go into but definitely made it much worse. Today I haven't used at all and I'm feeling confident about getting through the day without it and kicking this dependency for being high to cope with literally everything. I've found that I've become much more motivated to get back into healthy routines such as instead of first thing when I wake up taking dabs. I'll now first thing go into the bathroom, wash my face, brush my teeth, and brush my hair. That's helped me a lot with keeping my mind off that initial start of the day im so used to. The only thing I'm working on now is sleep, just drinking tea helped a lot especially last night. I had some nice green kombucha tea, gave me a clear head and relaxed the fear of going without it. I feel that by tomorrow I will be a totally different person because I can already feel very drastic changes in my life. Finding the things that excite me again and wanting to actually do them. I'm now in a band and we have our first show this February, I also love neurology! The brain fascinates me and how it works.

The problem I have is that all of my friends smoke weed. Sometimes when I hang out with them I end up smoking with them. This doesn't happen every time I go out. Many times I say ""I'm okay"" when they offer, but sometimes I accept, or worse yet, I ask for a hit.

When I'm not around my friends, I do perfectly fine avoiding weed. I never pick up for myself, so the fact that no weed is in my immediate environment makes it very easy for me not to smoke.

The dilemma that I have is whether or not I should stop hanging out with these friends. On the one hand, I've hung out with them while they smoke without smoking myself, so I should be able to do this every time I hang out. On the other hand, I seem to crack here and there because weed is in my environment, and I get really upset with myself for smoking.

I've told my friends that I want to stop smoking, and they will stop offering. But eventually I crack while watching them smoke and ask for some. When this happens they don't really resist. One of my friends said ""I don't really disagree with smoking weed so I don't mind letting you smoke"". The friend who made that comment has been my friend since I was 4 years old and we have lived on the same street all our lives.

I really don't want to give up my friendships, but if I can't stop smoking when I am with them, I fear I might have to.

Any thoughts on how I can avoid smoking when I am around people who smoke? Also, any thoughts about whether I should avoid hanging out with my friends and try to find new one?",3

This time my mentality is, ""I'm done smoking weed. The pros no longer outweigh the cons."" As such, my withdrawals have been minor. Small bit of night sweats is really the only symptoms. I haven't experienced any desire to smoke.

It's weird but really nice. I think this forum has really helped me by reading about people over coming the struggle, seeing that I'm not alone in attiction, and the positive encouragement from everyone.

I had to quit after some really traumatic circumstances where I had to move to a country where it’s not legal in a short amount of time. I haven’t been to a therapist in the same amount of time I haven’t smoked, when previously I went for two years straight. I’ve always had anger problems but my irritability is at an all time high constantly, though it’s definitely better now than it was for the first couple of weeks. 

I only have one friend here and I don’t expect her to like babysit me, she’s got her own shit. my family is here but are all extremely abusive so even though I’ve been reaching out they have no idea how to be around me without insulting me. I’m trying to find a job but it’s been difficult with the nightmares, lack of any support system whatsoever (I’m thinking of going to an NA meeting in my area soon though), and my sleep schedule being fucking whack. All my friends back home are trying to support me but there’s only so much they can do when I’m 16 hours ahead and thousands of miles away. I guess I’m fucking depressed and it’s not because I quit using. I’ve been trying so hard not to fall into just playing video games all the time and all that. Planning to take Muay Thai and pottery classes soon (can’t wait to smash some pots w my feet’s lol). I just need some fucking friends I think that’s the thing that’s been really fucking with me the most. 

I am somewhat grateful though. I don’t think I could’ve quit any other way. Even though some days I would kill for a smoke and I’ve almost gone back to tobacco it’s nice to be clean and conscious and present and be clean from most vices except occasional caffeine and sugar (edit: also I think my shitty diet and sugar addiction is making my nightmares worse lol). It’s just I think I’ve been denying a lot of my symptoms that still continue on cuz I thought the 1 month mark would absolutely just wipe everything off the map. Like me being annoyed all the time and angry - def a symptom of depression but also withdrawal exacerbating it. I feel like a useless loser but I know, I know I’m not, I’m trying my best. a lot of negative shit is popping up because I was suppressing it and repressing it isn’t going to help. 

I also have been getting better at trying to separate my emotional reactions. Like asking myself “what’s the core behind this” “why am I so angry about a person who isn’t even here or in my life anymore” “what will I accomplish by thinking about this” “why is it easier to concentrate on other people than on moving forward right now”. “Is this because I haven’t slept or eaten properly or or taken my meds or a decently long shower and what can I do to fix that”. Anger has always been so easy for me to access and that’s been good in some ways but also really unhealthy in others. I have a ton of PTSD from being in violent situations since I was a kid w two asshole brothers and getting into fights constantly even after they moved out and just a ton of other shit. 

Positives are that I’ve been able to remember more, my libidos returned (weirdly up and down) and my initiative is back. I’ve also been writing like crazy tho that might be because I’m unemployed and not in school currently lol. I do have a (maybe) date tmr and I’ve always been good at meeting people which is like a survival skill I’ve honed really well. When I smoked I was just nesting and not my friendly self at all unless I was in a park w a j. 

Ok. Ok. Gonna journal some more too and hopefully that’ll help. My heart is with y’all.",1

I began this weed free life journey on December 1st 2019. It was a strange morning in many ways as when I awoke from the haze of the previous nights smoke I made the decision that weed was no longer going to control my life anymore. 

It’s mad how after over two decades of consuming weed every day I awoke to this mindset, where does that come from I wonder? 

It hasn’t been entirely easy, the first few weeks trying to sleep was my major issue for me, feeling unsettled and restless however exercising and eating a plant based diet really help me resolve that. I dream every night and have only had one nightmare since. I’m feeling way better and have more motivation to go out and do the things I’d normally avoid, or feel to paranoid and anxious to challenge myself to do. 

41 days in it’s like night and day. The chains are being broken day by day. 

Anyway I just wanted to share this achievement with the weed free team. Stay strong friends 💪🏼",7

Withdrawal?

That bitch is real and after a horrible 2 month period where i had horrible waves and normal waves, i think im finally stabalizing, just a bit foggy, my acid reflux is still happening and sometimes headaches but it's fine.

Addiction?

Ever since i quit, im on this whole addiction is a disease thing and im trying to quit everything im addicted to or at least moderate. Thank god alcohol was never a problem so i had maybe 3 drunk nights and obviously today too, in the past 68 days. I stopped overeating, overshopping, playing video games for too long, and coffee and sugar.

Health?

I bought a whole lot of vitamins: zinc, iron, magnesium, lion's mane, ginger, omega 3, vitamin B C D K, ginseng. I started exercising, and i wanna do meditation too.
I drink tea all the time now, i used to have 4 coffees a day minimum, well i had to cuz weed was slowing me down, now i only have like 3 a week or so.

Brain?

MY BRAINCELLS ARE BACK, MY MEMORY IS BETTER, MY REFLEX IS FASTER, I MISS IT I MISS MY BRAIN.

Drive?

My drive for life is back, i dont settle anymore, learning new languages, looking for a job, eating healthy. I just wanna do better.

It took me a year to take the plunge but now I'm 8 days sober and don't ever want to go back. 

A friend asked me to look up some moon astrology thing because they don't have wifi, apparently its a lunar eclipse tomorrow and for those who are into that kind of thing its a big deal, the end of a cycle that started in 2018. So anyway, I found myself diving deeper and deeper into this rabbit hole of astrology and it's actually been really helpful on my journey of sobriety so I thought I'd share.

While numbing myself for the last 10+ years with weed, I lost touch with a lot of myself. Now that I'm sober I've been painfully bored and struggling to find anything that gives me pleasure this past week. Tonight that changed. I've never been interested in astrology and I still don't think I really ""believe"" in it, but reading about my signs and my birth chart tonight really lifted my spirits. I was reminded of who I really am, what I'm capable of, who I was before weed and who I can be and want to be again. I have some great qualities, and I have some less than great qualities too, but I'm not going to beat myself up about those because it's just who I am. 

If anyone out there is struggling to get to know yourself again without the haze, this might help. If nothing else it's kind of a fun distraction and left me feeling really optimistic. Good luck and enjoy the full moon :)",19

And that affecting my walking. Today I finally got some answers from a neurologist that I’d like to share with the community. Apparently when you smoke synthetic marijuana which I was in inadvertently Exposed to only once in some individuals you can bind to your THC receptors in all areas of your brain permanently. This isn’t necessarily a problem if you never smoke weed again. However because I continue to smoke regular marijuana I had all kinds of symptoms. Initially it was just trouble urinating so much so that I would have to sit in a warm bath sometimes when I was high in order to Pee. Sometime later after a period of abstinence when I would smoke I would get muscle spasms in my legs. I wasn’t sure if it was part of cerebral palsy which I have or if it was caused by the weed and medication I have for muscle spasms took care of it so I just kept smoking. Fast forward for almost 5 years later and I took a weed edible and had severe severe muscle spasms worst that I’ve ever had in my life. Then I started to realize I was walking in a different manner. That never went away neurologist did an MRI and was able to ascertain that further damage was done to my cerebellum and my basal ganglia both of which are responsible for controlling voluntary movements and walking. The theory is that because synthetic marijuana bound to my cannabinoid receptors with such affinity that as I progressively smoked it eventually led to the point where I was paralyzed and subsequently changed the way that I walk. 
I’m writing all this so that others who may have been exposed to synthetic marijuana can understand that even if you continue to smoke regular marijuana it may and in all likelihood will cause you further problems down the line. I’m sober now and I’ll never go back 30 days in the books, On to infinity, Someone can try to cross post this to the trees reddit so others may see it, I’ll probably get hella down votes. Also for what it’s worth life is beautiful don’t take anything you have for granted and don’t spend your days masking the beauty of this world in the sheen of marijuana if you’re thinking of relapsing, Dont I believe is my purpose now to share my story and encourage others to stay sober.

My partner and I have talked about quitting for a while, and since we live together we know it would be practically impossible for only one of us to stop. This week he told me he was stopping once we finished our bag, which happened today. At no point has he told me that I have to stop but it would be unfair and unnecessarily difficult for me to continue.

I've been smoking daily for about 7 years, before that I smoked recreationally but when I developed chronic pain I started using daily to manage my symptoms and medication side effects.

I'm honestly terrified what the next days or weeks will bring. The only pharmaceutical that helps my pain is tramadol which makes me sick af. Previous attempts at pharma treatment have left me taking increasing numbers of pills to manage various side effects which is depressing and pretty unsustainable (for example, whenever I complain about my pain management I get a scrip for 4g paracetamol/acetaminophen per day which would shorten my life considerably). Cannabis has given me so much quality of life but it's expensive, illegal and a pain in the butt to keep on hand.

My biggest motivation, was one friend who had quit for years and recently started smoking again. Heck, even my father smokes for 40 years. I literally have nobody to help me and motivate me, except you guys of course. (Thank god I had flashback of this sub today)

I love the plant and the whole process, this will never change and I know some of you will hate me for saying this. But I do quit, because as many of you have said, growth never comes from comfort.

First let me say I'm truly thankful for all of you in the leaves community. There is nobody else for me to share with about my struggles with marijuana, so much respect for those posting their stories and writing comments. That helps me so much. Lurkers, let me show my appreciation to you too, cause I lurked for a long time before finally posting.

I've been smoking off and on for the past 15 years, the last three years things have progressively gotten worse when I started to wake and bake more regularly and it became a daily habit of smoking alone in the afternoons. 

The biggest challenge for me is I was a highly functional stoner. It makes me creative and full of energy. Nobody seems to ever be the wiser and I get what I need to get done, and the mindless tasks of work and chores are so much more enjoyable. But even as my addict brain was trying to convince me that this daily habit was ok, that I was destine to be like a Seth Rogen functional lovable stoner, I knew that I could no longer control myself and it was seriously holding me back in life.

The last six months I've had a four month clean streak, followed by a month long relapse, followed by the last six weeks clean. Here's what I've learned.

1. If you are serious about quitting, get rid of all your stash and paraphernalia. Give it away or throw it in the trash. It is really the only way, because as long it is within reach, it will always have control over you and one day you'll just be rationalizing why it's time to smoke. Especially when that boredom hits. I still think about smoking almost every day, but when I know it's not around me, pushing the thought aside and abstaining is easy.
2. Decide on a new habit you will put in place instead of smoking. For me that was Yoga (which I never thought would  be so great, strongly recommend) and long walks of 10,000 steps listening to podcasts, music, and calling family. Chose something that you can commit to at least 5 days a week so it creates a new mental habit. 
3. In the beginning, each month with that money you are saving, do something nice for yourself.  Remind yourself that staying in recovery is really, really hard and it's a big deal, especially the first weeks and months. Be kind to yourself!!

Ok so here is where I need help. I found an old grinder while cleaning up and it has scraps left in it. That triggered me hard into the cravings. I went for a walk and was only thinking about buying a one hitter to smoke that up, and that lead to thoughts of driving some hours to a legal state or contacting my old dealer for just a small bit. 

I'm not sure I need encouragement but just want to hear from those that are in recovery or just thinking about quitting, What are your tips to staying in recovery and beating back those strong ass cravings.",13

She expects me to do everything and I know that some of this is my fault for not setting better boundaries.  (She just graduated college and will be moving out soon-whew!).  So she says to me “you’re a depressed miserable person and that will never change “ (she never knew I smoked).  Boy, that really hurt. I almost broke- I wanted to drown my sorrows so badly. But I got through it and I’m proud that I abstained. Just needed to vent. Thanks for listening.",29
2020-01-09 17:42:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/emhduj/first_day_finally_made_the_decision/,First day - finally made the decision!,"A bit about me: I'm 28 years old and have been smoking for a few years, this past year almost daily. I left an abusive relationship last January during which I unfortunately developed the habit of heavy drinking and frequent smoking. As a result of the relationship I have CPTSD, so even after breaking up I've still kept up the habit to deal with the symptoms.

This whole past year I've kept telling myself I'm gonna get my shit together, be healthier and start looking after my body and mind, but I'd end up feeling really bad and returning to my crutch. Now that a whole year has passed it's hit me just how deep a funk I've been stuck in, and I feel like I've wasted so much time as typically the weed has killed my motivation, made me much more withdrawn socially and generally made me feel like a burnt out loser. I acknowledge that the weed and alcohol is worsening my CPTSD symptoms, not making them better.

Depression and anxiety has been really bad for me lately and my self esteem has been so low that it's made me really \*want\* to quit (I guess for most of the past year I haven't really wanted to). It feels really good just to feel that drive to quit, to actually be looking forward to living a sober life rather than dreading it.

So as of today I'm cutting out both weed and alcohol. Maybe I'm being ambitious trying to cut out two things but I know me, and I know that if I smoke I wanna drink and vice versa. I think cutting both out is the only way to do it for me.

So, that's my story in a nutshell. Hello everyone! Happy to be here and part of such a supportive community.",4

When I smoke again my skin improves, when I smoke again my heart rate lowers!

She knew i had problems with it in the past and kept bringing it up anyway. I decided i was gonna try again to see if it was something we could do together (BIG MISTAKE). I ended up trying, smoking everything i had bought even though i knew i shouldn't. I told her this and now shes saying dont worry ill make sure you dont do it again blah blah blah.

Several times per day. I'm 670 days sober from alcohol today. When I quit drinking I increased my cannabis intake to counter it. Since then it's just not a ""good"" thing in my life.

Lately cannabis has had **zero positive effects** on me. I don't even feel high if I smoke. But what I do experience is intense anxiety and **severe** panic attacks. It got to the point where every time I smoke, I could expect a severe panic attack.

After a major panic attack last Thursday I became terrified to smoke again. I decided I can't have another panic attack like that. I stopped cold turkey. I've been having health issues since then and I'm not sure if it's withdrawal.

I'm experiencing severe pulsatile tinnitus (left ear only). Severe headaches. Severe lack of energy. Severe lack of appetite (I'm eating 2 very small meals daily). Nausea. Insomnia. Half my problem sleeping is this damn pulsatile tinnitus, hearing my heartbeat and blood flowing SO LOUDLY.

I went to the doctor and they said my left ear is ""perfect"", no infection. Blood pressure normal. Temp, normal. They did an EKG, normal. Waiting on blood work for thyroid test.

Day to day the severity of my symptoms varies. Yesterday morning I was miserable, but it got better by the afternoon. This morning I have a severe headache and I'm not sure I can even work. Considering taking the day off.

I don't know if I'm sick or if I'm experiencing withdrawals from cannabis. Maybe both? Today marks 6 days. I had not gone more than a couple days without cannabis in 8 years before this. 

Alcohol withdrawals were hell, I never thought I'd go through withdrawals of a substance ever again. I didn't think cannabis had withdrawals. I'm having a hard time convincing myself I'm not dying. I'm working with my doctor in the mean time in case my symptoms are unrelated. I have an appointment with an ear/nose/throat doctor next Thursday.",2
2020-01-09 09:59:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/emar0u/creativity_and_the_marijuana_muse/,creativity and the marijuana muse,"In my early thirties I wrote a short story and submitted it to a literary magazine. I'd written plenty before, but being deeply self-critical, never submitted any. This one was different. It was full of vitality and truth-telling. I knew it was good, so I put it out in the world. To my delight, it was published, and even nominated for a major short story prize. After it was published, to my shock, I got an email from a literary agent asking to represent me if I had a novel underway. This is an agent who represents Pulitzer prize winners, blockbuster bestsellers, authors who've had major their novels adapted to Hollywood movies. I was walking on air. I started working on a novel. I wrote a manuscript for a novel, but it had no life. I knew it sucked, and I choked. My occasional pot smoking became habitual--it seemed to free my judgement and inhibitions and allowed me to write (ironically, the short story I produced without smoking for 6 months--that's how engaged with the writing I was.) As many in this community already could guess, the shine in my writing was an illusion. In short, my writing was mediocre when I was both sober and high. I was really stuck. Life continued...and ended. My birth father died not long after we reconciled. He was an abusive alcoholic who left the country when he was supposed to show up for my 11th birthday. Then my stepfather died. He was a kind, beautiful soul, a pediatrician in an inner city clinic, with nothing but love and acceptance in his heart. Then my marriage fell apart. In a panic, I married again too soon. I never stopped smoking. Not through raising my older son, not through raising my much younger son from this second marriage (by raising I mean being the primary caretaker)...Now I'm approaching fifty with little to show for it. Just a lot of regret and self-loathing. But that part was baked it (no pun intended). I was damaged goods from early on. Too damaged, I'm afraid, to be redeemed by the love of an amazing stepfather. (""Give me the boy of 7, and I'll give you the man"" the saying goes.) When that literary agent approached me back in 2006, he said if I didn't have a novel then, I could keep his letter and make good on his offer whenever I had something ready. He gave me the example of one of his authors who let 10 years lapse between the initial offer and finishing his manuscript (to great success). I don't know that's me. I'm hoping against hope here. I'm moving from one weed legal state to another, and (no pressure) have to make this work for my current wife, myself, the world to see that I've amounted to anything (other than an exceptional father who has raised two amazing kids). Clearly, I've got deep problems from way back. Depression (pharma medicated), self-esteem issues, thin skin and intolerance in my interactions with my wife. But I won't give up on this one life. I haven't smoked this year. But god I'd love to...even the illusion of producing good work seems more tolerable than producing hopeless dreck. Any comments welcome--but especially artists, 40+ parents, and people who found a second act in life!! Thanks for this phenomenal community. I couldn't get this far without it.

It is soooo worth it because u feel soooo great about yourself. If ur quitting keep going never stop, if u relapse quit right after. It is all about progress not perfection

- remember my life. Experience life and then have memory of those experiences

- better relationship w my husband (he couldnt stand that I did it but really and truly he never knew the extent to which I smoked). I've been lying to him for years about it and it just made me feel like such a bad person. 

- save several hundred dollars a month

- can plan a trip anywhere and not worry about how I would bring pot or get it there 

- my health- my cough, my lungs

- no regrets when I'm on my death bed

- won't get munchies and eat shitty food 

- will be more articulate at work. My company deserves better. They treat me so amazingly and I've been high the whole time 

- take control of my life and not the other way around

- no more risk of driving w it 

- no more having to go to my drug dealer. Nice guy but ugh I hated having to go

- actually feeling my emotions

- wrinkles. I'm 41 so smoking only makes you look older. Period. 

- all the hiding. I smoke everywhere I go. Cant tell you how many places that I've snuck in my cart,  went to the bathroom and was getting high as a kite w no one the wiser 

- the smell. I love the smell don't get me wrong but I hated how it stuck to me and could get me caught if the wrong person smelled it.

- better memory. I have 3 college degrees (got all 3 being high as a kite ugh) but I don't remember shit so when people talk about intellectual things I say ""yeah I think yada, yada,  yada."" because I don't freaking remember even though I know I've learned or experienced what they are talking about

Beginning of day 4 for me  I'm actually feeling really good. Bad night sweats, and lots of boredom but I've been getting mentally prepared for the worst so I'm just taking it hour by hour. Day by day. 

This sub is what has 100% helped me make this decision. And at this point it is exactly that- a decision I'm making. 

One thing I'm so grateful for is that I'm making this decision and it's not being forced on me by my job, husband, or the law (I live in an illegal state).

I got better and started smoking again but hugely cut down went from about 10 joints a day or more to just one maybe 2 as was little mini skins. It hit me hard my body/mind just couldn’t deal with being high. I didn’t enjoy it I wanted to get high but then when I was high I didn’t want to be felt like I was panicking or what not. I felt it was odd as how much I smoked daily before I just couldn’t understand why i felt the way I did! Right anyway I’ve gone cold turkey now it’s only been just over 2 days but man I feel good/alert/awake but I do have some withdrawal symptoms i got chills/ going hot and cold - one minute il be roasting hot high temp next minute I’ve got goose bumps/ slight head aches but not too bad I can deal with them. I haven’t lost my appetite im still eating like I’m a fat git so I’m happy there I don’t feel the urge to smoke a joint :) only thing I not liking is night time I find it hard to get to sleep as I close my eyes they feel like there having a part under my eye lids/feels like I’m looking around left/right up down and my eyes just want to open but i want to sleep that’s probably the worst thing I’m dealing with at the minute :( but if I keep my eyes forced shut and don’t have the urge to keep opening them after about 15mins ( that’s a guess I’m not sure how long tbh) my eyes tend to relax although I feel really hot I go through that then next minute I’m waking up to my work alarm so yay I fell a sleep/ wake up once maybe twice through the night and pillow is soaked in sweat. It’s only been 2days but I’m hoping that’s the worst of the withdrawals as I’m pushing on through it -but I’m not sure if it get worse but yea I’m ready for it I’m determined I’m finished with the weed. I have to young boys and my health to think about. I’m just wondering what symptoms people are feeling and how long for and or does it get worse or is the early stages more intense? I’ve got the grounded app on my phone which is a huge confident boost as can check my progress/money I’ve saved and grams not smoke etc  anyway sorry for long book I’ve just wrote but I feel better talking about it. People who are quitting weed I salute you keep up the good work maybe hard now but trust I think our brains Are angry at us now such as headache/boiling hot or freezing but in the long run will be thanking us that’s for sure. New to this sorry for book and thanks for listening. Damo Aka Denz  sorry for grammar and all that yes I’m English as well lol but I’m no good at writing etc,6

I have concentration problems, but quit taking Adderall because of side effects I didn't enjoy about a month ago (it was very difficult). Now I want to quit smoking because I've been abusing it. I am finding it to be really difficult, and at my breaking point. I can't focus for shit at work. I can't eat, work, or be happy. I am beginning to think I fucked myself by going too hard the past few years after some life transitions (two little boys; new job). I just need some motivation from this sub to help me continue on my path to a marijuana free life. I still have it in the house because my wife uses, and doesn't desire to be weed free like me. I respect that, and she has been moderating her usage and avoiding it around me. Anyone else relate to this? I feel so tired and demotivated right now, but trying to be strong.",1

My depression and anxiety is absolutely insane right now, attempted suicide and self harming. 

I am on day 40 & know that the only thing that makes it go away is smoking weed. Doctor even prescribed me Valium. Which is so much worse and so much more addictive than weed. 

I am beginning to think that it is best for me to attempt to go back to smoking, in moderation. 

Has anybody else experienced anything like this? 40 days seems like such a long time. I was smoking skunk since I was 12/13 and am now 22. So I believe it’s a case of unfixable skunk induced psychosis.

2020-01-09 05:48:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/em80oi/my_storyweek_1/,My story+week 1,"Good morning everyone!

Im a 24yo girl from the netherlands and i have been smoking weed sometimes since i was 17, and since i was 18 everyday.. 

When i first started smoking weed i only did it socially and with my then bf since hes the one that got me to try it. And eventually smoked a joint with my mom on my 18th birthday, and ever since that day i started smoking every day.
It started with only smoking before i was going to sleep, because it really made me sleep well (i thought). And eventually it would grow to alittle earlier on the evening so i could smoke one before eating, because suddenly i felt like i couldnt eat correctly without it..

Then it became right after work, because i would be so stressed and annoyed about what happend that day that i'd make myself high so i wouldnt feel so annoyed.
Im glad i never made it an habit to smoke before or during work, but on my free days oooh no. 
On my free days i always did wake n bake, very nice to wake up to but 2 hours after i already wanted to sleep for the night again, so i just felt tired and wanted to stay in my bed all day.

I have always been thinking about quitting but everytime id say to myself that it wasnt the right time and that i would relapse if i did it anyway. So i never tried quitting since i hate the feeling of dissapointment in myself. And i still had those feelings a week ago.

But i started to read peoples stories about how they quit and why, and that also encouraged me alot! The withdrawals and the outcome of quitting, made me prepared and i still read them everyday to keep encouraging myself. 

I ended up making a pro and cons list and believe me if you add the money and all the things you wanted to do but never had the money for because of weed, was a huge encouragement! I smoked more than €300 away in a month. 

I just got a new job and they offered if i wanted to go to school on their cost and told me they were very happy with me! And i remember trying to go to school and smoking weed first thing when i was done, and thats one thing i dont want to happen again and this time complete my classes and keep climbing up in my new job and do the bes that i can!

Last saturday i was with my 2 best friends (one smokes, the other doesnt)and friend 1 was talking about how she wanted to quit the following day.
For a few hours id keep quiet about it, but kept checking my bank account with a balans of -5€, so i had no money at all and have to wait another 20 days before i could buy anything. And yes friend 2 is very helpfull, whenever i didnt have money hed still give me money to put on my buscard (bless him for not wanting me to bike for an hour in the winter🙏) and i knew he wouldnt be trusting me if i bought something else from it! 

But that day i kept thinking about the positive changes and the money i would be able to save up! And with that in mind i told the 2 people closest to me that the following day i would smoke my last joint before bed and i calculated it well enough so i didnt have weed to throw away (one of the things i couldnt do) but i did throw away all my rolling stuff and only kept my cigarettes and such. And since i havnt bought weed and i havnt smoked anything other than cigarettes. Which i also want to quit in a few months! 

So sunday after my last joint:
Knowing it was my last joint for a looong time i tried to smoke it as long as possible, didnt work and when i finally had finished it i couldnt sleep till about 5 in the morning while i had to get up at 9 to go to work.
 
Monday: i was so tired at work, and customers can be so annoying but i kept content and friendly. After work i didnt even feel the need to smoke any weed, and the moments i did have cravings it dissapeared again after a few seconds!
Which made me more encouraged!
But at night i couldnt eat my dinnerdinner, only a few bites thought what we ate is one of my favourite foods! And i had a damned hard time falling asleep.

Tuesday was pretty much like monday, very tired at work but the cravings werent really there at all. Hardly couldnt eat and kept feeling hot and cold, one second freezing and then the next second be sweating and hot af. But i did sleep abit better this night!

Wednesday: 
I woke up more alive and felt way more energetic than i have felt in a long time in the mornings, i could eat abit better, lunch went down smoothly everyday but dinner was the problem. But today i could eat like a normal person! I went to my 2 best friends after work and ate there. I was so happy i could eat like a normal person again! And i was dancing with one of them since i was really hyperactive (thats also how i feel now writing this down so sorry for the book of text).
For the first time after quitting i slept at 1.30am instead of at around 4am. Which was aaa huge relief.

Today thursday!
Today is my free day! I slept nicely till 10am! And i was abit afraid of the craving creeping up on me on a free day, but im happily telling you all that i still dont have the urge to smoke anything else than a cigarette! 
Today im going to go to one of my close friends and take my dog along. We are going to some exercises and afterwards take hour little furballs to the forest so they can run and have fun!

I know im only on day 4, but im so happy i made this change! My mom told me i was less annoyed than when i was high and i also feel way more energetic and happy and focussed after only a few days! 

Last week i still thought that this periode wasnt the right time to quit, and this week im actually thinking i can keep this up forever!
And keep seeing the positive changes and the thought about being able to more things that i want to do when i get my salary really lifts me up! 
I have no longer that i get anxious when im going to hang out with someone who doesnt smoke weed or doesnt know i even did it. Also scared that if i met someone i really liked that i would chase him away with smoking weed. 

For me there were alot of situations i couldnt smoke a joint and that would make me avoid them and now i can just go without worries. I definitely still have a long journey ahead, but im in such a positive state and have people around me who help me with everything they can! And im so grateful to my mom and my best friends! 

Thank you for reading my book of text! And good luck on your journey! With the right mindset you can almost do anything!",4

I started smoking weed, and I liked how it seemed to make my thoughts about him and about death calm down. Problem is, I started smoking daily. Because of partner pressure, I started hiding it and stopped, to sometimes relapse.

Both my parents were emotionally immature and they never learned to handle their feelings( high social anxiety, fixed mindset, inferiority complex, un-empathic and afraid). I never learned that either, or, I didn't even know people could feel not lonely on the inside, or that this constant fear and self judgment don't need to happen. I always repressed my feelings and thus never learned to have them. Thus, any feeling is overwhelming if I let myself feel it. I do not know how to love myself and not be self destructive because this is how I was raised (my parents put their emotional needs on their children, including their anxieties and passive aggression).

I used to smoke tobacco (10 years > 1 pack per day) but quit 3 years ago together with my wife, with the help of Allen Carr's book. It was easy because we were both sick and tired to always consider if we can smoke where we are going, avoid long flights, etc.

Last year, after some time of feeling hopeless and depressed, I started meditation (did a 30d 45 min daily challenge), and it helped me stop craving for a few months.

However after some time I found myself craving again and I started using legal weed. Now, this doesn't impair my work ( I freelance so weed would be counterproductive), but I find myself craving it just like weed.

When I travel, I have no cravings. When I get back home, I NEED to have a drag.

My wife understandably hates it, and because of my emotional maturity being lacking, I end up hiding it. Breaking her trust repeatedly is taking it's toll. I feel so rejected when she complains about the smell, that I am too afraid to be honest.

I used to have a problem with compulsive lying when feeling (afraid, insufficient etc). Now it mostly happens around my psychological addiction.

I want to not need a substance to be able to handle feelings. I want to stand up for what I believe, instead of smoking something that makes me dissociate. However because of my lack of emotional maturity and psychological addiction, I pick instant gratification over my values.

The problem I am having is that even when I stop the weed, I still crave it because I know it silences my fears.

My goal is to be honest with my wife, the weed is only part of the problem.

I am doing self therapy for emotional development.

I don't know how to live without a substance as it is always something. Tobacco, weed, caffeine, MAOI teas, I no longer drink but used to daily after my father's death.

The road to emotional maturity seems lifelong. I want to not be an addict sooner than that, as it is harming my relationship and progress.

How can I approach this? Am I addicted or am I emotionally immature? I don't know what to replace the substance with (eg being able to have feelings without panic). I have hobbies and all the things that should make for a healthy lifestyle. As many neglected kids, I excel in most other things.

Can I stop being an addict before fixing my self love? I don't know if I am just finding excuses, but I feel powerless.",27

Since 2013. And have been trying to quit also, on and off, for a year now (for all the same reasons that are mentioned in this lovely community). Starting 2020, have been sober and hope to stay sober this whole year.

Mostly I find that out of sight and out of mind works as far as marijuana is concerned. But I find it the toughest to stay away from a drag or two while watching a show or a movie. For so long now, chilling on my couch, smoking a couple of joints and binge-watching a show was the norm. We'd do it on weekends, holidays, week days post work. It's almost become a habit now. 

Im usually a very happy and productive sober person (I've done this a few times, so I'd know) but the worst cravings come when I'm chilling with friends and they all smoke and I have to stick to cigarettes or wine to keep my cravings at bay.

Any advice or tips would really help – apart from asking to change my friends circle because I can't really do that. :)",4

So here goes: I have been smoking since I was 13, pretty much daily, I’m now 53. Sigh, I’ve quit lots of times, longest has been 9 months and it felt great, the fog lifted my dreams came back, but it only took one time to go right back. I quit again this  New Year, the day they legalized it! SMH! But, I’m just tired, my lungs are tired, the weed now knocks me on my ass, It takes the light out of my eyes, it makes me moody, antisocial, countless times it’s made me throw up, I don’t even know what that was about, it seemed like an allergic reaction, you’d think that would’ve deterred me, but no. I’ve had chronic bronchitis before, for months on end, but still, no. I wonder what more I could have done with my life had I not been smoking.  I have a terrible memory,  it’s embarrassing, I went back for my high school reunion a long while back, and everyone kept telling stories that started with ‘Do you remember....’  and I didn’t.remember.anything  that they told me, how sad is that?! And that’s not even the half of it. 
I think It started as a coping mechanism for a nutty mother, but  she  passed away.  Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t  her fault and I love smoking pot, love it,  but it doesn’t make me feel like it used to for a long time, now, it’s just a habit.  I would like to live my life, which is more than half over now, being more mindful and present, and possibly start to live up to my potential. 
I’m an artist, and I teach art classes, and I’m good, I have a gift, and I’m grateful for it, but there’s this underlying feeling that I’ve pissed it away by smoking.  I could be so much better. I’ve been in a slump for along time now, I used to get high and do art all the time, that was a long time ago. I have this fear that I’ve tapped all of my dopamine and killed my creativity, that my brain didn’t have time to develop, and that it really doesn’t know how to function without THC. I know that’s irrational but who knows what damage I caused, I started so young.  I could always rationalize it, because it is pretty much my only vice, I don’t smoke cigarettes or drink much, I never liked pills or cocaine much either.  Just weed, sigh. 
I sometimes turn to journaling to work out my angsts or whatever, but I came across r/leaves and thought I would put it out there, in hopes it would help some one else instead of sit inside a notebook that I never had the stomach to go back and read. 
So many of the stories I’ve read here, y’all are so young,  you have your lives ahead of you, you have so much potential, far be it for me to preach, but weed is so damn powerful now, and if your here reading this, then you likely think it is a problem for you, and if you think that, then it is. I wish I would have owned it as a problem when I was in my teens, or my 20s, or my 30s or my 40s but hey, maybe this is my decade! 
I have lots of pothead friends who function very well and live full active engaged lives, my husband included.  He is so kind and supportive, he sneaks away from me to do a hit so he won’t tempt me,  I can smell it, but honestly, I don’t even want to, of course this is only the first week. 
Well, this has been cathartic, and if you’re reading this, remember the long game, don’t squander your potential getting high when it isn’t serving you, you don’t wanna look back and wonder how much more you could have accomplished, trust me it sucks.",144

Stopping was never a topic for me because I never felt an urge to. I'm a highly functional addict. I get my shit down, am successful in my field and looking at a job-wise bright future.

But I would lie to myself, if I say the 10 years didn't take a toll. It did. In so many, in so subtle ways. Maybe it has less to do with the substance itself, but more with the implications of being addicted. 

Being addicted takes a toll. It's exhausting. It alienates you from people who care about you. It costs you soo many opportunities, since you always prefer to take a smoke. You always have something to do. Even if it simply is to go home to take a smoke. I'm sure I had found a wife yet, if I didn't seclude myself during my student time.

I thought a long time about quitting. Now my dealer is in prison and I have no reliable and steady connection left. This is an opportunity, I'm forced to stop but also want to stop at the same time. I will not look for new dealers. I have smoked enough for my life time. Sure, I don't want to be dogmatic. If the opportunity is a good one, I may smoke a joint together with friends. But the daily smoke alone time is over. It's time to grow up, as a human which has losen a shackle. 

I will always love the effect of weed. But I know it's not healthy to be addicted. And I know, that I have an addictive personality. Time to focus on other stuff. Founding a family, finishing my PhD. 

I just wanted to get the thoughts out. My decision is a final one. I'm relieved and at the same time sad.

I love smoking weed and have been for quite some time, but with some pauses in between. The thing is:

I’ve been smoking hash for a long time, because it’s very easy to get your hands on where I live and usually a lot cheaper than marijuana. Also a lot more potent than marijuana and typically mixed with other chemicals, to make it weight more as well as more effective in terms of getting high. 

I’m currently on *day 5* and I feel terrible. Let me be honest.

I’ve read a lot on /leaves to not feel alone with my shit and tbh I wish I could say that I only experienced a few withdrawal symptoms, but I’ve been through some tough ones so far.

# GOOD TIP: I’ve been logging all my days, so I can look back and see what I’ve gone through when I think about smoking. Reading what I’ve been through makes me more focused on the goal and to stay on track, so my “pain” and suffering so far haven’t been for nothing.

I’ve had insomnia for like 5 days straight with a maximum of 4 hours of sleep at night. I always had problems with sleep because of a very busy lifestyle in terms of work, dead-lines, expectations to myself etc. Withdrawal just made it worse.

I’ve been having fever-like symptoms such as ice-cold hands and cold sweat. Laying in my blanket at night and sweating. I have almost no appetite and hate the thought about food. My dreams has also been vivid and crazy the last few days. The thought of having to go to sleep every night triggers me, because I know I’ll have a hard time doing so.

**PEAK:**

It really peaked for me today with a lot of stress at work, because of almost a week with lack of sleep and things to do. I had a panic / anxiety attack whereas I felt like I wasn’t moving my own body. My breathing started to get out of control and I felt like I was going to pass out. Things got dizzy and I couldn’t read text on a PC or my phone. It was a living nightmare. I tried to tell myself it was just withdrawal symptoms, but my body completely shut down. Not due to the symptoms alone, but the combination of that with lack of sleep, stress and work. I literally felt like I was under influence of some substance.

It got so bad I had to go to the hospital and get calmed down, because I started freaking out. They took blood test and so on, but nothing to find. I didn't say I was quitting weed, but just explaining my situation with dizziness and the weird feeling I've experienced.

\-

Sorry for the long post, but I feel like I had to get it off my chest and I’m very curious if anyone else have had so strong withdrawal symptoms. Sure hash is a lot harder on the body than marijuana, but my mind and body is totally off control at the moment. I’m hanging on though. Something better is waiting for me.  


Good luck to everyone else trying to quit!",3

Vivid dreams last night- or, nightmares. Woke myself up by acting out the physical fighting in my dream.

The anxiety and depression is settled in my chest. Been getting feelings of cortisol/adrenaline running thru my veins like I am responding to some kind of trauma. Like my body is triggered into fight or flight mode. 

I’ve cried more in the past two days than I did during the several years I was smoking nearly constantly. It got to the point today where I felt borderline suicidal- I wanted it to stop. I wanted the thoughts and feelings to go away and I couldn’t make them. I called my therapist and she talked me thru some belly breaths and legs up the wall pose to calm the f down. 

Raw, unfiltered guilt. Shame. Justified? Probably not but it felt it. Obsessive and ruminating racing thoughts that compounded every time I tried to push them away. I was pacing and hyperventilating and sobbing earlier. Started feeling intense self hatred for everything I’ve done while high- bad decisions, money spent. realizing that I was shutting off the more evolved part of my brain every time I smoked...

Can someone please validate me? I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety depression and OCD in the past, so this isn’t a huge surprise, but wow it is painful. It’s like six years of anxiety was deferred and delayed and today hit me like a Mac truck. I am a smart but super anxious person and I feel like the anxiety is taking advantage of the fact that my brain is functioning once again. 

Has anyone else dealt with similar withdrawal symptoms? Please tell me how long this is going to last...it’s so uncomfortable. Oddly I don’t have a desire to smoke more weed. I just want time to pass and for this to stop.",1

Today I read my journal throughout those years and saw how much pain I went through. Seriously, I have more than 300 entries to my 'Quitting Weed' journal. I lost count on how many Day Ones I have had. For the past 10 days, I've quit like 7 times already.

Anyway, its the end of day 1. I am not even convinced that I'm not gonna buy a joint tomorrow after work and smoke it when I'm going home. (you see what's going on here?)

I don't like this. But I will get on top of this addiction. This time, when I quit, I will accept that there is no place for moderation in my mind. Not even after 1.5 years. (also, I think I was so suspectible to daily smoking because I had essentially replaced weed with alcohol, now I'm not drinking but smoking. I keep trying to escape feeling some emotions that I need to process. But as long as I medicate the feelings away, I'll keep being hooked to whatever medication that is.

2020-01-08 16:43:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/elzfro/really_bad_weed_insomnia/,Really Bad Weed Insomnia,"Hi all,

I’m having trouble getting good sleep since quitting weed for New Years.

I had started smoking my first time only months ago upon being forced to retire from one of my passions back in September, and I quickly took up quite a strong smoking habit (in my opinion). Coming into October I would smoke 3-4 times a week heavily, multiple keefed up bowls etc. (gratitude to my roommate/best friend who had been pining to get me to try smoking). 

As the months progressed I realized I didn’t want to smoke that much anymore due to how paranoid and anxious it made me (I had a full psychotic deconstruction-of-reality type trip that I still can’t fully put into words), and I made the decision to fully quit on New Years.

Before this decision, I had also taken an extended break to study for finals in early December, during which I also had terrible sleep. I chalked this poor sleep quality up to immense stress, but I am now realizing it is due to quitting weed.

I would say that since I had quit for New Years, the average amount of sleep I would get per night since quitting is around 4 hours. I have also straight up not slept 2 of the 7 days since quitting.

I have always had trouble sleeping, where it would sometimes take 30 mins - 1 hour for me to fall asleep if I hadn’t exercised and meditated, but this is unprecedented. Last night it took 3 hours to fall asleep, which led me to sleep for 3 hours until I woke up in cold sweats and got about 2 more hours of sleep before being unable to sleep again. 

I have a strict regimen of no electronics an hour before sleep, no laying in bed except to sleep, meditation prior to bed, and 5mg melatonin an hour before I plan to go to bed. I am at a loss as to what else I can do to fix this.

Any advice is appreciated. I’m so tired of being exhausted but unable to sleep, and I want to get this problem rectified before I have to return to college next week.",5

So I decided that I was going to try and stop smoking weed for at least a month (might even prolong it who knows) and this first week is draining me.

Since Friday, I've been sleeping one day and then up the whole night the next. It's not like I'm not going to bed at a reasonable time either. I just toss and turn until somewhere around 4am I just give up. The only reason I'm getting any sleep is because I'm so exhausted from the night previous.

Did this happen to anyone else? How did you overcome it?",18

Cravings have not been as high as my desire for 2020 to be different. However, legal thc vapes hit the shelves for the first time ever in my province today.

Vape pens have always hit me differently from regular pot or even dry herb vapes. They helped me be creative and study and did not give me that overpowering feeling of loss of control.

I vaped for a while until the news of the lung disease came out and I stopped right away. But now they are available legally and fully tested for adulterants.

It is very hard for me not to cave and pick one up right now, I wish they came out before I stopped so I could get it out of my system.

Still, I know picking one up will lead to many of the same problems that weed has introduced into my life.

I think i will make this a habit from now on to use this sub as a diary since i noticed it helps to calm my mind down and i also hope that what i write is usefull for some of you here...

So yea.. as i write this piece i just passed day 3 and am going in day 4. I noticed that my withdrawal symptoms were higher today.
Yesterday i've only sweated a bit. 

When i woke up this morning, my bed and sheets were soaked in sweat. The least physical activity i did today made me sweat like hell... But i consider it a good thing since it means my body is getting rid of all this toxic bullshit.  Guess all i can do is drinking enough water. Even now as i'm writing this piece i'm sweating and i do nothing lol. But i guess it's because it's almost time to sleep.

I'm a machine operator in shift and this week i have morning shift which means i even sleep less then normal 😂 But i gotta say that even if i sleep less then normal my quality of sleep has improved a lot even after 2 days.

I feel more present, clear-headed and i noticed my mind is progressing stuff faster and faster every day , which feels amazing! Only thing that sucks about being more present is that the time goes slower on work😂 But this also made me realize that if you go sleeping high that you are 12h later still under influence...

I also noticed that the voice of my addiction is more present now i reached day 3. My addiction is somehow realizing this is going to end and it's protesting. I noticed that it made me question if this really if for forever. ""You also not gonna smoke when you gonna do psychedelics?"" ""What you gonna do on a party/festival?"" And all this kind of crap.

I think its typical for a lot of us. Realizing the forever thing about it. But i found out that it's easier for yourself if you don't focus on the forever aspect of it. Ofcourse we all want to quit forever, but i realized its easier if you set hour goals. This hour im not gonna smoke. And for every hour you do you will gain confidence. Trust me guys.

Anyway... Up to day 4 💪",2

Just my personal anecdotes and story with weed.
I need to get this off my chest.

Today is the day I smoked the last tiny amount of weed I had.
I'm doing this out of the necessity to change my life. It's exciting but also a somewhat scary. This is kind of a big picture view, but know that while reading this, weed use was a constant thing through this. 
I also have no issues with cannabis or cannabis smokers, it just ain't for me no more.
I have been a daily pot smoker for 10+ years now. I turned 30 in December '19. 

Weed smoking started out as coping mechanism and remained that for the past decade. I remember really getting into pot when I was doing my final exams as a Software Developer, at around age 19. I was terribly anxious. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. This really got to me, I was always a somewhat meek and a very skinny guy. Not having food and sleep wrecked my weak body and I got so anxious I started throwing up before going work. I started smoking weed to be able to forget about my work/exam worries. It helped me go to sleep. 
I loved meditating while high. I was hungry. Sex was great. It felt good and natural. A lot of friends experimented too. I almost felt like a rebel, doing something illegal (I grew up with two abstinent parents and I used to be super anti drug as a teen).
I passed my final exams.

I carried on for the past 8 years and things always somehow worked out for me. I got good jobs, tried many different things. I worked in IT as a programmer, as an all-rounder for an International School in Switzerland, worked as a teacher in climate education, looked after the elderly in retirement homes, went on stage as a slam poet. A lot of things that I needed to step out my comfort zone. I even got two little poems published in an anthology about my home town.
I was okay. I continued to smoke weed since it helped with anxiety, appetite and sleep. 

I was always an introverted, anxious and somewhat depressed person, but I was okay. I takes a lot of energy to be outgoing at work etc. but I carried on and was always able to maintain a very good facade to the outside world. Nobody knew about my weed habit and my emotional and psychological issues, except my GF who went through this with me that past 10 years. Weed was always there to take away the stress and anxiety I was experiencing. 5 years ago, I started doing weightlifting and went from a weak and skinny guy to adding 30 pounds of muscle to my frame. Girls noticed, and even though I would never cheat on my GF, the compliments boosted my ego. And all that while smoking weed. I felt like superman only later realizing I was just suppressing my negative emotions.

Thing is, it stopped being a coping mechanism in the past two years and became far more destructive. And only now I'm starting to notice what I'm suppressing. And what I have to deal with now. What I have to face.
Two years ago, my long-time GF (who is still with me, bless her) who I was living with got seriously ill. We always smoked pot together, which made us some what reclusive and indoorsy. It's what we did. 

In late 2017, my GF began to develop psychotic symptoms. It went from having ""ghosts"" touch her arm and hearing weird voiced in her head to not reacting to me when I asked her a question, being withdrawn from reality. I remember her asking me what the fuck those voices were. We carried on, smoking pot of course. Her health deteriorated. I started asking her to cut down on the weed consumption as I noticed her getting way worse while high. I was getting worried. At the same, being hypocritical, I continued consuming the same amount of weed. Long story short, the past two years were a series of her becoming schizophrenic, throwing me out of the house because she thought I wanted to hurt her (heavy paranoia), me moving back in with my parents after 10 years of independent living, me having to force her to get compulsory hospitalization at three different psyche wards on three different occasions, together with the cops and friends as well as some officials of the social system here. Harrowing experience, having to force somebody against their will, physically, to go to an institution.

She wasn't able to form coherent sentences anymore, didn't want to see me, accused me of controlling her thoughts when somewhat lucid etc. She was in a different dimension. When she got out of the mental institutions, she would go get weed immediately, hounded me and friends to give her some. She was kicked out of the first institution because she got caught smoking weed with another patient.
It's all she was interested in anymore.

Truly a traumatic experience. I was broken, couldn't work for a while.
Stayed at my parent's place. Continued smoking pot. I noticed I started to become very anxious while high, and very, very sad. I became a nervous wreck every time I got high, which was all the time. I couldn't stop. 
I started a new job, as head of IT at a school. 500+ people and many more devices, as well as teaching in class and looking after a budget (money of the public) of 250'000 $ a year. That was nerve wracking. I had to deal with the local politicians. I was tech support. I was a teacher. I was a manager. It was a high, insane pressure situation and I was messed up. 
Ergo: They fired me the past September, after 15 months of me barely coping, which I can't blame them for. I would have done the same.
Constant pot smoking continued.Today, I've been at my parents' for a while now. Haven't worked since September, basically being a recluse and smoking pot and surfing the web.

I started reducing my weed consumption over the past two months. I realized that during the past 10 years, weed was promising me an escape from my troubles, acting as a masking agent for my anxiety and troubles I had since my teenage years. I realized I used it to forget. I realized it makes me nervous and paranoid. It makes me forget my obligations. I makes me not want to grow as a person and face my demons. It fucked my lungs and liver because starting weed led to cigarettes and alcohol. When weed wasn't ""working"" anymore, I moved on to alcohol. I was  never a drunk, but I certainly drank daily. I realized that weed was a false promise of comfort. That I was addicted, and that it changed me. 
I was always considered a ""good guy"" and I know I am. But weed made me do so many stupid decisions. It made me look the other way. It made me miss out on opportunities in life, because I preferred being high.

The silver lining: The past three months, My GF is on the way of recovery, she is back to normal mentally with minor physical symptoms due to the meds. It took two long years of weed smoke and many tears on my end. I'm very grateful for this chance to do better. I'm happy that I came to the realization I have to stop. I try to see this whole thing as an opportunity to change a lot of things. I have an apartment of my own now, at least for the next six months.

That's why this is it. I'm done with weed. All the weed I had is gone and I won't get more. No more. I'm sick of the anxiety it gives me, I'm sick of the smell and I'm sick of being high but failing in real life, having to suffer, because I struggle with addiction and depression. I'm also kicking cigarettes, haven't smoked in 4 weeks. I'm a little scared of the future and I'm seeking out professional help at the moment, but I'm excited to finally get to know myself better and to do better.",36

Thanks for being a part of this community. Just introducing myself, I was a pothead for years and then started experiencing heavily paranoid episodes after smoking. Quit for a few years and then relapsed.

I’m based in the uk and have been smoking since age 15 basically every single day, I’m turning 24 at the end of the month and knew it had to stop. 

I’ve been a green user, dealer, pusher, tourist and cultivator. I’ve made some of the best friends in my life though it, had some crazy adventures, great sex and plenty of memories. 

In my first year of college my best friend was murdered and I think this gave me the ‘everyday could be your last’ feeling which I interpreted into do whatever you want everyday, get as high as you want. Maybe it was to cope with the emotional pain I don’t know...
 
It was only when talking to a stranger about my usage when I realised I’ve probably only had a total of month sober since 2011 and that would have been cause of a weed drought or a holiday where it wasn’t available. In 2014 my mom was rushed to hospital and I couldn’t be woken cause I was in such a stoner slumber, my little sister had to take her and I had no recollection of anything at all. 

I don’t even want to think about the amount of money I’ve spent on smoking 0.5-2.0g a day, I don’t drive and plenty of stoned decisions has left me £5000+ in debt. I always told myself that because I’ve held down jobs and progressed to management that it wasn’t holding me back. I never got high before work or as a musician before I got on stage, that’s how I justified it. 

I’ve used many other drugs and have never felt addicted but just the idea of knowing I’m planning to not have weed in my life anymore.. feels scarier then I’d possibly imagine. 

But anyway, here I am day 3. I woke up with no motivation, called in sick to work and feel like I’m just going insane. The only thing keeping me sober is knowing that I have definitely upset friends, partners, family with my drug usage and it’s time to make a change. This group is amazing and I’m very happy I was signposted here. 

Anyway brain dump over!

Myself, I been smoking on a daily basis since 17 years old.  Im 34 in October. Almost 17 full years of blazin up, all day, every day.

After a recent break-up, i moved to a city in Oregon that voted against legislation, so there aren't any shops, or mmj products i can buy.

I still had my pax, and my dab pen though. Had dabs to load the pen, and the pax. Every so often i go up the mountain 20 minutes to get a new pod, maybe more dabs. 

But last week, my pax broke. Just stopped recognizing the pod, wouldn't pull hits. 

Additionally id been off my antidepressants for a short time due to issues getting the rx renewed, so i was very raw and emotional, as anyone who takes antidepressants knows if you just stop, you're gonna have a bad time. And it takes a minute to get back on track with them, they aren't instant. 

Anyway the point is my pax broke, and i was devastated. I had no meds working in my brain and my crutch, the weed, was all i believed i had. 

I had a meltdown and cried a lot, got angry, and ultimately fell asleep. 

Did i mention i work at a weed farm? Everyone i know smokes. I could have asked a friend to hook it up the next day on the way to work, but i didn't. 

I didn't the next day, either. Or the next. 

Now it's been a week, and today i didn't feel like toking at all.  I know it won't always be like today, but it just feels good to not *need* it like that anymore. 

I am stronger than this addiction. I am the one giving it power. I can just as easily take it away. 

I was tempted tonight, but i refrained, and im grateful.",14

On Sunday I realised I had forgotten a bud in a tin with a vape (had meant to give the empty vape to a smoking friend as they’re expensive here). 

I didn’t throw it out right away and spent the last couple of days mentally agonizing on and off about whether to smoke ‘one last time’. Except, I know myself... it would have been enough for a few days smoking and then I’d have been out of weed but with all the cravings re-energized. 

Today I reviewed old journal entries about wanting to quit and my list of reasons why. I searched for ‘relapse’ on here and spent a full hour reading posts from those who had and regretted it (thank you for sharing all!), which I fully recommend if you’re feeling tempted.

Then I bagged it all up and binned it! Honestly it was even harder the second time around but I know it’s the right decision. I didn’t want to start over with all the fresh cravings and anxiety that brings. I want to be free.

Onwards and upwards friends!",16

I want to feel all the success that everyone tells me I have the ability to achieve. I started smoking my freshman year of college. I smoked all day everyday. I didn’t go to class, didn’t make grades, and lost my scholarship. I tried to go back but same thing. After I found out I was bipolar weed made more sense to me. It controlled my depression, my anger, my loneliness. But it has also made me an angry little man when I didn’t have any. I see everyone saying to get a hobby but I just can’t. I play a computer game but everywhere I look I see people talking about it. I don’t know how to make friends or even talk to women. I understand the word won’t change for me but I guess I want someone to hit me in the head with some common sense. Weed has ruined everything.. my daughter’s mother left me, I can’t hold down a job ( I will legit quit if I don’t have bud), and I am lying to everyone who asks. It hasn’t even been a day and I am feeling awful.. time is passing so slow.  Maybe I’m just rambling but I have come across the subreddit a couple times and decided it was time to ask for help.",3

Possible chs," I am 22 years old and have been a chronic user since about 18, picking up my use recently. In the last year or so, I have noticed a morning nausea that has been increasing in severity. I never really thought this has had to do with marijuana, but I am now realizing it likely has. Recently, this has gotten quite bad. The last 3 days, I have had a constant 24/7 abdominal pain affecting my daily life and sleep. I first tried to counter this with weed, but that only made it worse. Reading online, it seems that I have CHS (though I have not been vomiting). I have decided to quit, been sober for about 36 hours, but the abdominal pain persists. Obviously, this is frustrating especially on top of the standard withdrawal symptoms since I am basically unable to eat anything.

For anyone who has experienced a similar problem in the early stages of quitting, I am wondering what remedies you took?  I am considering different remedies but I am worried some options will have an adverse effect on my presumed CHS symptoms.

Any advice helps, thanks.",5
2020-01-08 01:03:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/elopdd/contributed_to_severe_depression_and_lethargy/,contributed to severe depression and lethargy while others smoke and are fine,"I started vaping flower around the same time I started my first job. Became an every day habit. Was depressed already from having an empty life and thinking that this shitty job is going to be the rest of my life. I feel that over time it lowered my baseline mood, and definitely made me more lethargic which was always super miserable to push through since I worked a very physical job. May have affected my memory and ability to learn on the job which made my coworkers hate me, but part of that was probably just how I am usually.

The job got more and more miserable to the point I was thinking of suicide every time I walked into work and my relationship with the guy I worked under was horrible. I'd be high all weekend and walking into work on monday was so bad, leaving the comfort of being high and going to work seemed the magnify the shittiness of it x1000. That's how the lethargy worked. It felt like it was harder or more uncomfortable to do physical work.

That's the thing though, I don't have a period of me not vaping every day after work to compare to. I think part of the reason I kept at it was because I knew people that would smoke weed every day and do fine. A guy at my second job was my dealer and his car always reeked and another said he smoked 2 ounces a month and they did fine at work while I was fired for ""unsatisfactory performance"".

I saw a video from a top sleep researcher matthew walker about the effects of weed and alcohol and how it suppresses rem sleep, which he says is vital for mood control.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRp5AC9W\_F8&t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRp5AC9W_F8&t=3s). To draw any conclusion would just be conjecture which is a big part of why I kept it up for over a year. I've been clean for months due to circumstance and I'm trying to get work again real soon, and I'll definitely stay off it for a long while now having had time to reflect on how it's affected me and I'll see how I fare this time.",3

First time in a while I've had the willpower to deny cravings like that.

Tonight I can feel the withdrawals coming on (I'm on day 2)- all the random stuff from today that bothered me is starting to feel like the end of the world, even though I know it's not.  It's a familiar kind of withdrawal anxiety that I get when I try to quit.  Like everything just feels like SO much of a bigger deal than it actually is.  

Part of my journey with weed has been trying to escape feeling stuck.  Feeling stuck in my career, personal life, and really not sure how to fix these things- so instead of actually TRYING to fix them, I got hooked on weed to numb away those feelings and that burden of responsibility and work that needed to be done.  I certainly still feel stuck even though I'm quitting, feels like it makes it a lot harder to quit because I don't really have anchors in my life like a good stable job or a significant other.  But at least I can end the night and put my head on the pillow knowing I AM moving forward finally.  I didn't just smoke all day and watch netflix and eat junk food.  I actually did some exercise for the first time in like a month, and got some work done, even if it was difficult and fraught with frustration.  

I really don't feel good, this is not easy.  But I'm gonna hang on desperately to this feeling that I'm actually moving forward.   and I have to believe it will be worth it.

2020-01-07 23:01:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/elnbu5/relapsed_just_shy_of_4_months_hated_it_dont_think/,Relapsed just shy of 4 months. Hated it. Don't think I'm going to reset my counter.,"So I recently was visiting a bunch of friends in a city over new years. I drank a decent amount and everyone was smoking but I abstained. I am pretty good from abstaining in those environments now and even observed how my friend seemed more dull and not-fun being all stoned out. Grateful I didn't smoke

I stayed in that apartment for a few days with no real cravings. Then one night, we went out and got drunk. I woke up with a killer hangover. This is the biggest ritual for me. Nothing works on a hangover like weed. Every time I'm hungover I crave it (which isn't too often, but usually once a month).

Then they left me in the place alone for most of the day and had left their full setup out and it smelled a bit like weed. And I told myself - ""just this one time. You're hungover, it's a holiday weekend. You're not going to do anything today anyway.""

Being high was fine I guess. Parts of it were nice for sure, but overall I did not enjoy it. And the brainfog Zap that followed for 2 days was super gross. I felt so disconnected from everyone and just like dull and drained. 

  
My request for thoughts and advice:  
I don't want to reset my counter. It's finally getting to a number that makes me proud. It's literally my only relapse since I actively decided to quit (I quit once 3 years ago also, but wasn't a strong conviction or reason like this time). It was one day (I did smoke twice that day) and I didn't enjoy it. I had a mild craving to smoke again the next day - but I didn't; despite having the opportunity to. I didn't spiral like I would have in the past. If anything it was a strong learning experience that I hate being stoned and the side affects.

Originally my goal was to live without smoking for 1 year. That being said 4 months is 33% of the goal so it feels like I'd have to reset. I've decided instead I'd like to go smoke free for 2 years, but I won't reset my counter. I like knowing that I made the conviction to quit 4 months ago and consider my experience and mindset to be more in line with others in that time-group. 

But I'm worried that I'll feel like a fake or fraud. I was going to get a 6-month token but now I'm afraid it'll feel shallow or undeserved.   


It's silly cause I still feel on track and the counter isn't the point and now I'm spending so much energy worrying about it. But it's also been such a helpful tool to me. Do ya'll think it's fine if I leave it? should I reset it? does it not matter at all?",23

For those who are struggling, or considering taking a break... please listen to me. Don’t let weed control you. You’re so much better than that! 

Also, I have found buying a subscription to the app ‘Headspace’ is a lifesaver. Whenever I feel an urge to hit anyone up, I just do a 7 minute mindfulness. The subscription is only about 100-200 bucks, which is less than a month’s weed budget for me, and it has worked really well.",4

Because of this I have had almost no cravings or withdrawal symptoms. However today I got a nasty feeling in my throat, like it is dried out and full of phlegm. It's a similar feeling too if I smoked to many joints and my throat would get dry and scratchy. 

Is this a normal withdraw symptom? I have a couple medical issues all happening at the same time I decided to quit weed so it's hard to keep track of what going on with my body. Or maybe it's just a cold from my countless doctor visits the last couple weeks.",3

The biggest change I've noticed is in my mood: I'm not getting mood swings, and I'm a lot calmer overall. That might seem counterintuitive for people who haven't been chronic for very long, but I think long-termers will get that. It's like my brain is remembering how to brain again, and it's producing the happy and calming chemicals all on its own. I've also been getting The Dreams, and although some of them have been really weird, overall I've enjoyed my little adventures in dreamland each night (I think this is my favorite part).

As a disclaimer, it was last year that I broke my reliance on weed: I took a ten-day vacation where weed wasn't available, and that got me over the hump of needing weed in order to fall asleep. After getting over that (and yes, it was rough), I vowed to only smoke in the evenings, and to never again use it to fall asleep. This worked, for a while, but I still found myself counting down until I was able to smoke again, and getting really irritable when ""the plan"" changed.

On New Year's Day I was busy all day, and it was bedtime when I realised that I hadn't smoked all day, so I figured I'd try to keep it up. I don't even miss it!

Two years ago I quit my job because of my depression, it got so bad I was thinking about driving off the road daily and the only real comfort I had was when I thought ”Atleast I can end it whenever I want”. Ever since I was like 11 I’ve been depressed and it’s been back and forth but I really feel like it’s time I try my best to get better. I don’t want to feel like life is a bad necessity and that I have to keep on going just to make everybody else happy.
I’ve always wanted to stream games but never really had the courage to try it and potentially fail. I barely do now but fake it ’til you make it, right?

Weed helped with the anxiety and restlessness but I feel like I should atleast take a 30-day break from self-medicating because of how dependant I am of it and the social-anxiety it gives me. I feel like I need something to get me through the day without it and figured I can spend my day streaming instead. Day one is going to be tomorrow, 8th of Januari.

The first time was about 3 months ago, I quit for 36 days. I felt amazing and clear headed and so full of energy. I ended up relapsing for about 2 months, and I recommitted at the beginning of 2020. I'm a week in and I'm not doing great. 

My boyfriend and I went away to visit his family from the 2nd to the 6th, which was a great way to distance myself and get the ball rolling. But now that we're back home, I just feel hopeless. I feel like I'm drowning. Normal things that I can normally deal with/not care enough about because I was smoking, now feel impossible to deal with. I've had 3 panic attacks today, and I'm also pretty sure I'm getting a cold. I have congestion and a sore throat. 

The whole reason I decided to recommit to quitting is to be able to pass a drug test for a new job I'm trying to get. I have family and friends who work for the company, so with their references I've basically got the job. But I need to pass the drug test in the applying process. I'm so unhappy with my current job, and without smoking it's suddenly so much harder to do a good job and want to show up. I feel trapped and so unhappy.

I know I'm doing the right thing. This new job pays more, has better hours, and actually has health benefits. Getting this job will be a drastic improvement to my life. But this bit right now just feels so awful. My brain keeps telling me that I should be handling it better, that since I've done this once before it should be easier.

2020-01-07 19:02:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/elk8vb/my_experience/,My Experience,"A recent popular post on this subreddit has inspired me to put some of these recurring thoughts to text, they feel profound so maybe other's will resonate with what I have to share. Smoking weed for me was a way to unwind, it would change my thoughts from whatever route it was on to a more humorous or relaxed one. Randy Marsh from South Park said it best when he complained about how shitty weed barely changed his head. It would dissolve all my stress by rearranging things in my mind so that everything became terrific without me needing to even leave my home. But, the reality was in the throngs of pleasure, my mind performed mental acrobatics so that it would be unrecognizable to itself. Getting high would even give me optimistic premonitions about the future, like smoking was some type of sacrifice on an altar bending metaphysics to my benefit. How crazy is that? The world dances to my tune as long as I fulfill my spiritual duty of smoking ganja.

As time went on and the circumstances of my life continued to deteriorate it became harder for my mind to rationalize everything. It became harder to ignore my stunted focus. My victim explanations for my handicapped social skills became increasingly nonsensical. Getting high just turned into moments of positive thoughts followed by hours of hazy paranoia. I believe my subconscious or higher self has finally had enough. It's sick of me having no real identity. It's tired of constantly being a different person riding the flume every bong rip. Smoking weed was like letting some foreign (slightly effeminate) entity take the reins of my mind and body. It would muffle the voice that made me uncomfortable but actually wanted what's best for me. Trading challenges for mary jane, contorting my entire existence into a pathetic shameless treadmill of not-quite-enough pleasure. 

Anyways I have only distanced myself from the habit a couple of weeks and realize that my bold words may border delusion. The fact that I may relapse somewhere along the line also gives me anxiety. Understanding that treating the anxiety by toking or other substances is backwards, holds me back twisting so some days I feel trapped immobilized by a distrust in myself.  Like being stoned without any of the positives. However I believe that these thoughts are far more sustainable than the psychosis that I subscribed to when I would smoke regularly. Therefore, I promise to be patient with the addict in me. It's a rough landing but I'm finally descending from the clouds, no longer will I be an aimless bee buzzing from one flower to the next! Instead I will ground myself and finally allow myself to grow into a real human being with persistent values, backbone.",4

I really want a psychologist to say ""that cringey feeling you're getting is an indication of early schizophrenia"" or something else as dangerous so that I start to reframe cannabis.

Now I just don’t smoke at all and haven’t for about 3 months. It’s weird to me cause I joined this page a while back looking for support to help me quit but in the end I just ended up quitting cause life threw me a curve ball.

I do not do well with change. My doctors call it “adjustment disorder” but I call it a creature of habit. 

It seems like everything is new today and I’m scared. I know this probably sounds pathetic. Usually I would use weed to hide from these feelings and sort of just float through whatever I had to face. But today I have all these new changes without that crutch. I honestly want to drop my classes and get a refund on the tuition. I want to hide from this all. But instead I have to find a way to muster up the courage to face these new things with my new sober mind.

It had been 3 and a half months since I smoked. I turned down the joint the first few times it went around. After about 20 minutes I reached for the thing. None of the guys knew I have a serious problem with it and I didn't tell them. I said I stopped because 'I got quite bad with it' at the end of my time abroad but didn't clearly say, 'don't offer me any no matter what I say. I got badly addicted to it since you last saw me.' If I had just done that, I am sure I would have been safe for the night. Que scrounging around to smoke my friend's weed at 4.30 when he's got work at 10, getting a bag the next day because 'you're hungover and you smoked last night anyway, just smoke today and start again,' and a week of bingeing. Back to 2 days clean. A tonne of college work and afraid I will fail out. Head is foggy and feeling like nothing matters. Not feeling the withdrawals as badly because I am on anti-depressants now but really hate how I feel and what I've done. I have essays due every week this month and haven't started them, have no idea what to write and can hardly study. Don't listen to yourself when your mind goes to that place where it really feels like you can control your drug use. Different for everyone I guess but I know the reason I quit in the first place - I came to the conclusion that I had no control over it, I couldn't stop when I wanted, it made me extremely socially dysfunctional and ground development in life to a halt completely. After being clear of it for a few months, I naively convinced myself that I could chance another toke and not have it come to this again.

Have some personal stuff going on right now that is compounding the stress, but also sort of distracting me from wanting to smoke, so that is nice.

All in all, I don't crave weed right now. Even the thought of going back to smoking is consciously off putting. I don't want to fall back into that trap of habitual use, smoking all day and wondering why I am even doing it since I can't even tell if I'm high anymore. 

With alcohol, I always found that the first drink was the best. Even more, the anticipation of that first drink. Every drink after the first was me just chasing the feeling, but it was never attainable. Through a lot of reflection, I realize now that weed is the same way for me. I look forward to the ritual. I anticipate that first hit and feeling my troubles just melt away. Then I spend the rest of the day chasing that same feeling, despite knowing through tons of experience that it will never happen.

I am climbing out of this hole, one way or another.

2020-01-07 08:13:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/elbe7e/something_on_your_brain_and_withdrawals/,Something on your brain and withdrawals,"I tried quitting a lot of times, and I’m currently on day one again, but I’ve not had withdrawals since the first time I tried (or at least I have learnt how to deal with some of them)

Here’s my thought; withdrawals are created by yourself, by your brain, something that controls you, but also something you can control, so here goes:

1..The biggest one for everyone is sleep, and not falling asleep is utter shit, however here’s what I do: You know when you wake up for work, how you want to just stay and chill in your own bed? Take insomnia as an opportunity to do it, just imagine you don’t want to fall asleep, all you want to do is just sit and relax.

Often, we don’t fall asleep because all we do is think about falling asleep, keeping your brain awake, but if you just focus on relaxing for relaxing sake, more often than not, you will bring out the Z’s.

The first time I tried to quit, I forgot about everything I used to do before falling asleep (in my case watching YouTube videos, until I close my eyes and just listen until I fall asleep. And what I would do is just get into bed, snuggle up and wait, wait for something that never came.

So don’t change your routine, keep doing what you did in order to fall asleep (avoiding you know what part) and if it doesn’t work, who cares, you got some time to yourself, to relax, and by the next night you will be absolutely beat, which will help with snoozing along with relaxing.

2. A big one for me too were mood swings and depression, the first time, I let myself down spiral into it, without even considering that something else was triggering it. Here’s the thing, you are NO ONES BITCH, let those emotions hit you, but when they do, know that you are stronger than them, and grind it out.

When it got really bad for me, my dad told me there was four things I needed to get done every day, brush my teeth, shower, shave and get going to wherever I had to go. Once you’ve done that, it doesn’t matter if you don’t make it where you had to go, but at least you’re clean, and you’ve pushed past that mental barrier keeping you from leaving the house.

I thought this wouldn’t work, and there was a few times when I sat in the car before getting on the train to go to uni. But I did make it a lot of times, and it did work.

3. Cold sweats, this one I HATE. What you do is let anyone that lives with you know what’s going on, and that you might have to shower in the middle of the night. And that’s what you do, you get up,  have a warm shower and get back in bed. This was the best way I found, and it worked most of the times.

The last thing is: just get through it, quitting is about not listening to your own excuses, and even though weed would solve all of these problems in the short run, think about yourself, your future, and push past it. You’re strong, and you’re definitely stronger than yourself. We all support you, and we’re here for anything you need, keep up the good work ❤️",11

I stopped using a few days before New Year; first few days were alright, 1 sleepless night and some irritation but nothing too drastic

Then, and this is where the stupid comes in to play...I took mdma on New Years with a bunch of friends

Fun to be sure, but it's been a few months since using it and I didn't even consider the fact that I always get insomnia and depressed for a ģood week or so afterwards; in fact it's only just clicked that it's a combination of withdrawls AND the mdma comedown that's led to me sleeping twice so far this year...

11 days sober from weed, and 2 nights of zero sleep, and I've decided to go back to weed for a while, cause I just desperately need sleep. Hating myself cause I didn't join the dots and now I'm starting all over again in a couple weeks or so, I genuinely don't even have the desire to use it recreationally anymore but I know it's the only thing that's almost guaranteed to let me get some kip, although I imagine that in doing so I'll probably end up using it recreationally again at least for a bit.

I tried exhausting myself with walking for miles, eating well, and none of it's working, so instead I'm just erasing my progress at a point where I know I would've been starting to feel better by now if I hadn't taken the damn molly

It was cute and the perfect size to contain all my weed paraphernalia. In it, a smaller tin box, in which I kept my stash. My papers and tobacco were neatly arranged in their own little parts of the box, and the grinder I've had for 12 years had its own spot. I love that little box. It's the only part of my life that was always organized and ready.

I'm on my 5th day of sobriety, and I didn't know what to do with that box. It held such sentimental value. It's been with me for so long. I figured I'd keep it around because I thought it had so much history in it. I couldn't throw it away. 

But then...

I gave the box away to a friend who still uses this morning. I knew that keeping it around meant that one day, whether I wanted to admit it or not, I was planning to go back. 

I realized that any nostalgia associated with it was a lie -- that box never brought me joy. It's a symbol of my unhappiness. Why hold on to it any longer?

Goodbye, little drug box. You were cute and sweet and tried to ruin my life. You wrapped up a lie in a pretty little box and made me forget the poison you really held. I hope you serve your new master well -- because I'm done being your servant.

How long does that last? What's the outcome after all those thoughts? For me: Nothing. Just more smoking and more thinking without any action. I'm sure there are many people who can function remarkably well smoking everyday, without any negative consequences ... but that is not me. 

I sat at around 21days sober for the first part of December. The festive mood around Christmas and being around other smokers, i decided to end my streak. I was quickly back at smoking 4 times a day, waking and baking etc. I'm so disappointed but i want to pick up the pieces and start again...

At the height of my sober streak i cleaned out a cupboard in my bedroom that i have literally never sorted out for more than 10 years. I never used the cupboard for 10years cos it was unusable because it was full of clutter. That is absolutely stupid when i think about it, but my stoner mind was never bothered about getting down to it... cos well video games, Netflix etc. 

There's a childlike feeling that comes from sobriey/abstinence. A child never feels happy because of a substance. A child generates happiness from experiences. 

I remember a sober day towards the end of the streak.. i had had a great workout. Weights. Cranked out 5 intense sets. Energy levels were returning. The Witcher was playing in the background... i was buzzing. Felt like a man again for the first time in i dunno how long. That same child like natural high.

I had a lot of shit collapse on me that day. Long story short. I tried to commit suicide. I ended up in the hospital and in a psychiatric facility for a few days. Being there was like being in jail except I could actually walk around a single hallway. I met with doctors and had group sessions. But for most of the day I laid in bed and just let my head clear. That changed everything. I was also around people who had some really bad fucking problems. Like you could see the shit in their eyes type problems. 

All of this completely changed my view on things. I had no hope before but that place was a wake up call. Was only there for a few days but it really changed me.  I actually believed I could quit and get my life together. I realized all the shit that happened before that day just didn’t matter. I was done with it. 

The whole point of this post is to let you guys know that if you feel suicidal or depressed during the early stages of quitting. Please talk to someone. Find someone. Don’t bottle it in. I thought I had no one only to realize after that I had people there for me. I felt hopeless about my life on day 4. I had never been driven to that point.

It’s going to be frustrating to work through this in the next couple months and the rest of my life probably but I think it’ll be worth it in the end because I’ll get to experience life again the right way.

I’m 23 days in, heavy smoker for over a decade. I go to my first MA meeting tonight. It was sort of an intense experience. 

I leave, and while walking home, I cross the intersection where I would turn right to get to the nearest dispensary or continue straight to home, and find that I’m unable to move. I stand there for literally ten minutes without moving, warring within myself about which direction to turn. 

All of a sudden, I found myself turning towards the dispensary and start bawling my eyes out, which for me is rare since I’ve spent most of my adult life high. I couldn’t even tell you what I was crying about, it just felt like bottomless sorrow. I finally got to the dispensary half an hour later looking high as hell from the crying despite being more sober than I’ve been in about 6 months. 

Something about the the friendliness and earnestness of the people at the meeting made me fucking terrified / sad and the only thing I could think to do with that experience was smoke it away. I relapsed tonight, and I’m posting right now to keep myself honest tomorrow morning. 

Even now, I am high and the previous version of myself that was having such strong feelings is inaccessible and remote to me. I obviously have some shit to sort out and won’t be able to do it high. I fucked up tonight, but I at least did it with my eyes wide open this time, observing the little addiction triggers and dominoes in real time as did. I never used to let myself be sober long enough to have the perspective, so there’s that at least. 

I’m still going to go to next weeks meeting, and will begin again tomorrow.",7

I go a month not smoking then somehow I feel this “I’m being uptight” feeling. I give in, I smoke, then the dark cloud comes back over my head and just stays there. I find myself I resort to my old habits of smoking my face off late night, after work, after the gym. It’s a “reward” chase for me. I’m sick of “relaxing” and “decompressing”....my brain and inner self just gets over worked by the THC. After years and years of smoking, where is use to bring me peace and pleasure, it now brings pain because of the traumas and heartbreak it has given me. Relationships, jobs, my physical and mental being have all been altered from this drug. I wake up feeling like a bum, a failure, my life ain’t right then I compound it with drug use when I shouldn’t be pumping the shit into me. I use to tell myself it’s just weed, it ain’t hard drugs like coke heroin meth etc. That right there is a red flag about it in itself, we try to downplay it ain’t bad when for certain individuals like ourselves who have a problem with it AND have traumas that coincide with weed. 

I’m not going to get into my personal problems in life but I’ve noticed this, weed just slows you down. It makes you feel weak, inferior, and downright destroys my inner self. I feel like I’m missing something if I quit, but once you take a step back and acknowledge that this drug has changed it’s molecular structure of how it used to work on, now it’s the opposite. You have to tell yourself it isn’t good for you anymore. If you try to defend it, it will sabotage you slowly. Bottom line, when you know it’s turned to poison for u, u have to drop it. We all have our times with it, the real strong individuals know this and have to make changes or we will be on this forum looking for the right motivational post. So if u keep failing, it’s ok. It’s part of the process. Fail and fail then one day it will all make sense. Keep fighting friends, it’s a dirty plant, there’s a reason the government is now legalizing it all throughout the USA, they want your money and don’t give a shit about it will damage you in the long run unless u come to reality about it.",14

And then my SIL and BIL along with their 3 kids under 5 give us 6 hours notice they're staying for a few days. which sounded a whole lot like some shit had gone down as they don't exactly visit a lot. Turns out it was just that BIL had holidays as he worked through xmas, and the plan was to visit her family for the week but he had a tantrum about how they never visit his family and insisted we wouldn't mind.

My SOs drinking has gotten away on him a bit lately so our deal to support each other went out the window as soon as BIL turned up with beers and they fucked off to the shed, so I get stuck inside with SIL and 3 kids that have no concept of not harassing the shit out of my animals, all the while knowing full well SO was getting fucked up with BIL in the shed.

I cracked and yelled at one of the kids for picking up our kitten and putting him on the dog, luckily SIL had my back but still, wtf, who in their right mind yells at a 4yo ffs.

I went to bed about midnight and stared at the ceiling for 7 hours thinking about how I probably still had some kief or hash or something, anything lying around and SO crept in late as fuck thinking I wouldn't be awake to give him shit. I wasn't gonna give him shit in any case, I know he has a problem and I know ballbagging him won't help either of us.

I've still got 3 days of this shit and I know I probably won't make it to friday without smoking up, because I am an addict and that's what I do. But I bet I'll come up with an absolute banger of an excuse!

I quit once before, a couple of years ago, but I got back on the wagon three months into sobriety. I decided I needed to stop because I engaged in some really shameful behaviour - being a dick to people while high, stealing weed, not going to important family events in order to smoke, fucking up my financial life and delaying my career, etc. For once in my life, I truly want to change certain habits and finally own up to myself, to my responsibilities, etc. I wanted to start on the 1st, but I really didn't get the strength to do so until now.

Been smoking the last 2.5 years on and off. There were many times I thought to myself that I may have a problem with MJ. In the beginning I used to only get MJ from a friend or my gf would know someone. The amount they’d get/give was only ever a few buds (about half an 8th) so enough a couple good nights. We (me and my gf) would do this cycle every month or so. 

This was working out great, everything was better on MJ, food, tv, and sex,(and wanking, my god the wanking). However once my gf hook up left, I was left to find it myself.

I remember being EXTREMELY nervous my first pick up. Thoughts like, they’re gonna jump me and steal my car, stab me over a 8th and take my money etc etc (all perfectly logical things a person to think when heading to a drug deal... the illogical thing was my desire for MJ make these risks sound worth it - sign number 1).

So this went on for about a year, buying a q every month or so (I was a binge smoker, I’d take a couple days off work + the weekend and smoke from 11am to 11pm for 4 days straight, then nothing for a few weeks- rinse and repeat). (Sign 2)

 I noticed my gf never had to have these multiple days of getting baked, she seems to be able to show restraint and to manage to go to work. For me the desire to be high was to strong it was all I wanted to do. (Sign 3)

Eventually my dealer decided he only wanted to sell 14g minimums so half bags became the norm and then half bags began to last as long as a Q so I started buying a Oz when also began to only last a week. (Sign 4)

The biggest disruption MJ had on me was financially and physically. I’d become a food monster. During a typical 7g binge sesh I’d spend around $100/day on ubereats. Lunch dinner and dessert. I never wanted to prebuy junk food (and save money) because I was ashamed I was putting on weigh (and preparing junk food in advance felt like setting myself up for failure; if a bit cheaper) and each time I sparked up id tell my self “don’t eat junk this time”. It never worked.

The final straw was 20kgs later. I had started buying a q every 4-5 days back to back. Never wanted to buy more to save money because each time I wanted to believe I wasn’t going to binge. I remember sitting on my balcony finishing up my spliff from my 3rd Q in 10 days thinking “I’m not getting as high as usual.. maybe I should just have another right away”. I was not about to start changing smoking spliffs.


So I decided to quit on 1st Jan 2020 and here we are day 7. Anxiety through the roof, depression, all the joy has been sucked out of my body and every moment of everyday is consumed by thought of getting high. My sex drive is also non existent. 

The did not expect the sex drive loss, this isn’t mentioned as much as all the other side effect so what are others experiences here on low libido? I assume it’s because sex stuff was so good on MJ that the pleasure o get from masturbation without it doesn’t feel as good?

Anyways, thanks for reading and good luck!",17

I was a 'pot addict' from age 17 up until 25. I realized somewhere along the age 25 that cannabis no longer served me and first began by 'cutting back'. This helped my mind state ground itself more but it still caused me the same issues. No pleasure outside smoking, paranoia, borderline agoraphobia, loss of sex-drive and no motivation to change my life outside 'wanting change'. I had a breaking point around December when I had a terrible experience with cannabis and edibles. I lost my mental footing and felt like a psychotic break happened. The plant I loved and was so held so dearly to my heart had turned it's back on me. That was the moment I realized that I am done and I will no longer be a slave to something outside of myself.   


The first two days were definitely anxiety filled and the cravings were over the top. I had two mental bodies. One that was done and the other that was trying to lure me back into any reason to continue smoking and justify some 'temporary' reason why I wanted to quit. Days 3-7 were definitely rough when it came to cravings, but the anxiety started to diminish day by day. I started to have very cinematic and 'epic' dreams/nightmares each night. Days 7+ onward I have still cravings, but my anxiety has basically ceased. I feel like a stillness of mind that I haven't experienced in quite some time. This has been the longest I have been sober since 2013. Before this I could barely make it 3 days without caving in and sparking up. Cannabis was the hardest thing for me to ever just drop and say no more. From xanax, alcohol and cigs. 

  
I'm done with cannabis and I am looking forward to where this path will lead. I wish you all luck on your journey and may 2020 be the year we all are free from existential slavery caused by a plant hijacking our reward system of our brains. You can do it. Fight through the tough days and take it on moment by moment not thinking of how long it will take but how good it will feel once you're finally free.",3

Except that... wait a sec, what if I still feel like shit when I'm sober? What if I have all these problems and I've just been using weed to mask them? Specifically: lethargy, depression, stomach issues, anxiety, etc.

I had a therapist tell me that quitting is as simple as making a single decision. That’s all it is. A decision. On the other side of that, she also told me I wouldn’t be able to quit until I truly am ready to quit. I think that’s why it’s so damn easy now. I was finally ready to stop. To end the monotonous day-to-day pothead life I was living. I feel it in me again, that fire that used to burn in me. I’m getting my mind back on track, and I know what I want out of this life. Weed, liquor, pills— they have no place or role in that life now. 

I’d be lying if I said that the roach in my roommates ashtray doesn’t look nice, or that the aroma of weed doesn’t smell delicious- but that voice in my head that used to say “fuck it, man, just smoke” is far less persuasive than it used to be. It actually serves as a reminder that I have a problem, and that addictive part of my personality is not representative of me as a person. I am in control, and I won’t forget that.

I truly thought that I was dying.

And it’s in a moment like that where I have to look at my life and go “is this how I want things to end?”. Do I want to be remembered as having limited my goals and experiences due to a substance? Do I want to risk being that anomaly who ends up with health issues someday? Is it all worth it for some good tasting food, a wank, and a better music listening experience?

Im a random 24yo french guy and as you know, we (french) dont have the reputation of being good in english.

I'm smoking since 2 years now, approximatly 4-5 per days after work and i dont count the week-end since im high from morning to sleep. After my studies ( a year and a half ago),  I moved to a city where I didn't know anyone. When you're in a job routine its more hard to meet some new people so I isolated myself a lot and I got used to being alone. 

Since 7 months, my girlfriend dumped me and it was the descent into hell for me.  I became very lonely and melancholy while I was always cheerful and very open to others in my youth.  

  
Since then, I no longer meet anyone, I comfort myself in my routine and I wait until evening to be able to get high and not think about anything.  just be entertained and passive. My family have noticed that my behavior has changed, so I don't go home to my parents anymore because I don't want to justify myself and I don't like that they see me like that.

 I see this as inevitable, I watch the instagram stories of people who go on vacation in the sun as a couple or with friends. And i feel like  I missed something in my life, there is a huge lack, a huge void.

   
I want to quit but i know cannabis allows me to dodge reality because I don't like reality, it scares me and it doesn't make me want to.    
The worst part is that i'm totally lucid and rational about my situation but i don't know if i really want to change it.

Maybe it's psychosomatic, maybe it's the idea of finally having some control, but I feel stronger in my resolve every day.

Except...

I started heavy use due to incredible amounts of anxiety. I hated Xanax and didn't want to start a dependence on pills (addictive personality and all that). I have an anxiety disorder, but I also have a very anxiety-inducing life, notably regarding my family. 

I'm fine with my sobriety (generally) until I have to deal with the triggers of my anxiety. Without the cushion of being high, everything feels like it's hitting a raw nerve. I don't feel like I'm ready to give up and relapse just yet, but I admit I have moments where I'm paralyzed with anxiety that is feeling more intense and raw than it has in years. 

I'm starting CBT therapy soon and am trying to integrate exercise to combat it, but I admit that it's very difficult to get through. I don't want to smoke, but right now this is the hardest part.

I’m an addict. I mean, I knew I was before today, but I now see that it runs further into my life than I wanted to admit to myself. A year and a half ago I stopped drinking after 14 years, which brought with it so many changes. I am still adjusting to that, honestly. A lot of days I still don’t feel like I know who I actually am.

It just so happens that I’m also addicted to weed. I’ve smoked for 20 years or so, pretty heavily for about 15.

I try my hand at moderation during the week, only to smoke myself stupid on weekends, pretty much staying high all day Saturday and Sunday. If I have off work, I smoke pretty much all day. I don’t smoke at work, ever. That said, if I rack up consecutive days smoking, it’s a lot easier to justify it for another day. If I have days off (like recently), I smoke every day.

So much of my life revolves around weed. Pens to be discrete when I’m out and about, making sure I take enough on vacation or out of down, finding an AirBnB that we can smoke outside of, all my friends smoke, my wife smokes, all activities are more fun stoned,  etc, etc, etc. 

This is all like the same song and dance as when I quit alcohol, but in a way I feel weed is worse. Alcohol had pretty concrete, negative downsides. Terrible hangovers, saying and doing stupid shit, eating WAY more than when I’m stoned, etc. Weed just *isn’t that bad* in comparison. Sure, I get the occasional brain fog on Monday after a heavy weekend, but no major downsides.

I know that weed just keeps me from doing the stuff I need to do. I know it’s a coping mechanism for problems that I don’t want to deal with. It’s a way to hang on to a shred of the person I have been for the past 15 years and to keep masking pain, anger and discontent.

I’m scared shitless. I’m afraid of losing even more friends. I’m afraid of removing myself even further from the person I have been for so long. I am afraid of not knowing who I am. I am afraid of finding that person because I’m afraid I might be alone.

I have not lived my life completely sober in 15 years and I just have no idea what that looks like.

I don’t really *want* to quit weed, but for the immediate future at least, I know that I need to.

Aiming for 30 days to start, with the goal of observing myself. I want to be kind to myself and really examine the sober version of me that I haven’t seen in so long. I don't intend to go back to smoking, I just find the ""one day at a time"" mindset helpful, at least with alcohol.

Anyway...thanks for reading and I'm glad to join this community.

Not a massively heavy smoker (eighth lasted me two weeks) but I smoked every day for the past 6 years. Had some bad feelings of mental health recently and anxiety whilst high, thought I'd never be able to quit, but am going strong and it's been 9-10 days, which is the longest I've ever gone in. 

Usual side effects everyone else has described, trouble falling asleep and worse (for me) crazy lucid dreams. All manageable. 

However, in the past 4-5 days, I've had this weird feeling above my left eyebrow. It first felt like a hair was tiggling my eyebrow, I kept going to remove it but no hair. This has now moved onto to a slight numbness or tingling, I'm frequently rubbing my eyebrow to try and shift it, but it's not doing anything. I've read that anxiety or stress can cause this. I'm just wondering if anyone else has had this side effect? My main concern is that it's always been there but my habit stopped me noticing.

I feel nothing but sadness. It’s like I’m losing myself with each passing day.

Physical pain heals faster than mental and this is a true testament. The things that I once found joy in are no longer comforting me during this period. I’m just laying here contemplating life right now. I don’t feel suicidal, but I just wish my brain returned to its normal state. It’s only been a few days and I know it takes time. But it feels like this has been going on forever. I spent so much time being numb, that I was unaware of the consequences of giving up weed. It took an actual mental breakdown before I realized that shit was doing more harm than good. 

Although it sucks, I am appreciative to have authentic emotions back. Even if that means crying uncontrollably. I am happy that the panic attacks are over though. They truly sucked. I just have to get over the depression and lack of sleep. Being depressed is no joke. No matter how hard you try to change the narrative with happy thoughts, you always come back. I don’t even want to spend time with my friends. I loved doing that. The only thing giving me comfort is my bed. I wish I could turn my mind off, because it’s going full throttle right now. 

It’ll get better soon. When you make it out of this, use this message as a reminder. Do not let peer pressure or temptation trick you into going down that path again. Weed and alcohol were not things you found joy in. They were actually destroying you. The only reason you were unaware, was because you had distractions. You were on a routine to the point where you basically never had time to sit down and collect yourself, although you really lost who you were the past few months. It’ll get better, I just need you to hang in there. You will be normal again. You just have to get through this battle. You deserve happiness and you’ll definitely have it again. 

When you’re back, I need you to promise yourself that you won’t let little inconveniences ruin your day. No matter how big they may seem in the moment, it’s not worth losing yourself again. Try to be in the moment now. You’re young and bright with a future ahead of you. Don’t worry about it now and stop bringing up the past every 5 minutes. If you could change it, I’m sure you would be the first one in line to fix everything you fucked up. It was all a learning experience. You will grow from this, just like you’ve did with everything else. 

You have one of the best support systems, look at how your mom sacrificed her own sleep and spent time in the tub crying and praying because you weren’t okay. Your ass will always be a baby in her eyes and she needs her baby more than anything. Don’t give up, you’ll hurt more people down the road and like every other mistake, you can’t redo it.",13

About 4 years later and I’ve smoked almost daily (with a couple week/month long breaks here and there in between).

Most of the other breaks I’ve taken were situational - moving, new job, traveling, etc. This time the decision was deliberate because I’ve been noticing some pretty negative impacts from smoking. To name a few:

-avoiding roommate and other social interaction at all costs when high

-spending all of my time playing games or on my computer and not enough time pursuing my other hobbies 

-neglecting responsibilities and overall not caring 

I decided to stop for a month - at least a month and see how it treats me. The first day or two were pretty great. I had lots of motivation and found myself completing a bunch of housekeeping tasks effortlessly. Ive been making time to sit down and enjoy movies, and even read a chapter of a book before bed. I played guitar for more than 10 minutes the other day and really enjoyed it. I even went on an impromptu 5 mile (pretty steep and windy) hike with my best friend.

But today I kind of hit a wall. Partly because it was Sunday, but i had some pretty nagging depressive thoughts and negative mindsets. Insomnia, exhaustion, no interest in ANYTHING. Eating like crap. 

But I’m going to keep going. I know this is good for me. Glad to have you guys around as well :)",6

2020-01-05 21:50:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eknmc5/living_with_another_smoker/,Living with another smoker,"Smoked since high school, but in 2018 I fractured my hip in five locations. I’m no stranger to broken bones (have had over 20) but the hip put me in the hospital for a month and in bed for months after that, then a wheel chair after that.  This was some serious pain. 

I’m 45 and fractured it skateboarding in a bowl. This amount of downtime was excruciating, in addition to the 24/7 pain for months and months and months. Needless to say, my smoking increased exponentially. 

I just don’t want to anymore. Besides the physical damage to my lungs, I don’t like what it’s doing to me mentally. My number one activity is language learning. I’m good with Spanish (but always working to improve) and decent with Hindi, and I’m currently enrolled getting a BA in Arabic. It is so much harder since I ramped up smoking (plus the anesthesia in major surgeries really messes you up for months). I don’t want to sacrifice my languages just to get high, but I was. I usually try and do three hours of languages a day, but I wasn’t getting nearly the returns I wanted any more. 

So like many others here, I said no way in 2020. It helped because I took three of my kids on a five day tour of some cities so I was away from my house. 

I got back today though, and here’s the crux of it. My wife still smokes. All day. She was high when I got home in the afternoon. She got high before we went to the movies. 

That nearly broke me. Was Star Wars going to be fun sober?  I knew I’d actually prefer it that way, because I’d fucking actually remember it. But still, I barely made it to the theater sober. 

I did, but as I sit here tonite, man I am worried about being back. Worried I am going to break. So I am asking advice from others in the same situation. Any advice on successfully staying off when you can’t just clean out your house, throw away paraphernalia, and there’s always weed around?  And someone getting high?

Please note, I am not interested in trying to force my wife to quit. She’s awesome, I don’t control her, and honestly she’s always offering blow jobs after she gets high. Smoking is her choice to make. 

But seriously, could use advice from others who were in the same boat previously.  All the advice I see on this sub talks about getting rid of everything, changing your routine, and basically staying as far away from weed as possible. Any help?",1

My quick back story. I started smoking daily at age 16 I am now 22 living in CA. Out of the 6 years of daily smoking the only time I was sober was from March 2019 - July 2019. To get to that point it took me literally two whole years of being miserable and wanting so badly to quit but not being able to. What helped me take that break was actually releasing the pressure of wanting to quit. I stopped forcing myself. I used to have my roommate hide all my weed and wax pens. Ended up turning the room upside and finding it every time. I’ve gone to therapy. Seen a psychiatrist that gave me meds. None of it helped. The only thing that helped me was actually acceptance. Accepting who I was and what I was going through. Not trying so hard to change anything. Just letting life flow and letting my addiction be. I also tried some cord cutting meditations prior to that first break that I believed helped me. The biggest thing tho was to stop trying so hard. To stop focusing on my addiction and how upset I was about it. How much it ruined me. After I want to say a month maybe two of letting myself just simply BE, I was able to quit cold turkey. The worst side effects were my appetite issues. After 10 days those got better. Had some nightmares but after a couple months those got better too. I stayed busy. Being sober I started hanging out with my friends more. Human connection is very important during this time, reach out to friends and loved ones. If u don’t have friends maybe this is the time to go out of ur comfort zone and meet some friends whether it’s thru apps, bars, meetups, etc. spend a lot of time in nature. Mother Earth has very strong healing energy. 
Anyways let’s fast forward ... July my brain tricked me thinking I made it this far I think I have enough self control to be just a social smoker. Wrong. By August my same habits came back. I was dealing with a lot. One of my best friends passed away due to an overdose and these last few months have been the darkest moments of my life. Weed became my escape once again. But that escape made my life worse. I struggled with suicidal thoughts most days when I would smoke yet I wouldn’t stop I would only smoke more. To say the least these last months of 2019 were absolute hell. I tried sooo hard to quit but failed every time. Finally the new year came around and I knew it was time. I was smoking hella even on NYE when it was technically already 2020. But when I woke up on Jan 1, 2020 I knew it was time. Sometimes u just have to be patient until u truly are ready. You can’t force yourself. You have to take it easy. And everyday can be ur new fresh start that New Years brings. It’s still early 2020 it’s not too late. Love yourself , be patient with yourself and know that if I can do it so can you. 

I recommend juices. I know many ppl say smoothies which r great but for me even the texture of smoothies is too much for me to take down when I’m detoxing. So juices and soups r my saviors. Also treat yourself to ur fav foods when ur detoxing. It’s hard to resist eating when u have ur ultimate favorite food

Spend as much time as possible with loved ones. Please get out of your house as much as possible. Please spend time in nature as much as possible. Please be patient with yourself. Please don’t put so much pressure on yourself. Please don’t get mad at yourself or hate yourself. There is nothing wrong with you. You are exactly where you are meant to be even if you don’t believe it. I love you and I am here for you. I have a lot more advice to give but this is already super long so please comment or send me messages with specific questions please. The last 3 years of my life have been spent trying and trying to quit so I have tried so many different things and have so much advice to give. Many blessings to you all.",1

But last night, feeling beat down after a shitbag of a sober week, I turned to the almighty Google in order to find something I felt I could connect with, somebody who seemed to understand what I've been going through (just like a good milennial should)

Eventually this led me to this subreddit, and it couldn't have come at a more appropriate time. It's a strange, yet extremely comforting feeling to be reading through all of your stories and going ""shit! That's me!"" Multiple times throughout

But most of all, I have been absolutely blown away by the sheer amount of empathy, kindness and wisdom all of you have displayed in this little corner of the internet. Not only has it shown me the value of Reddit as a platform, but it has bolstered my faith in humanity as a whole; some of the stories on here are heartbreaking, but seeing you guys reaching out and offering what comfort and advice you can is heartwarming and wholesome as fuck.

I'm currently 9 days sober, and whilst the sleepless nights and massively increased anxiety are currently making things less than spiffing, I know I'm gonna be okay, because when things start to get tough I can come back here and remind myself of why I'm doing this.

I really don't even give it a second thought anymore. Sometimes nostalgia hits me when I think about it, but the cravings are gone! I got through Christmas, my bday and New Years without it, even when I was surrounded by it. My friends (even those who smoke) are proud of me! I am proud of me too. Honestly i didn't plan on quitting, I just randomly quit last month when I applied for a gov't job (assuming I'll be drug tested). I used to say I would never quit because it was only beneficial, but I was wrong. I realized after quitting how different I became, perhaps because I was using it too heavily and for the wrong reasons. I quit cold turkey after heavily smoking flower for 3+ years. I've learned so much about myself in the past month. It feels like the ""real me"" is emerging from a shell. My emotions fly right out of me w/o question, lol! And it feels really good knowing that I can struggle through life w/o using weed as a ""cushion"", or out of boredom, or whatever else I was doing with it. Also, my dreams have been phenomenal and so out of this world. I remember them more easily and can even wake up and return to the same dream. It's incredible! I feel very alive and present when I'm awake. I don't question everything like I did when I was stoned, and I feel less anxious in general. There are so many benefits of quitting, but the one that stands out to me is getting to know myself again, in a new way. Thanks for reading my rambles! Good luck to all you leavers! You got disssss!! 😍

2020-01-05 12:54:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ekgdhq/i_believe_in_you/,I believe in YOU!,"First post on Reddit. I made an account because my friend recommended this page would help me stop smoking the WEEEEEEEEEEEEEDD. It has helped me a lot, I never could have imagined that many people have the same problems I do. I smoked for 6 straight years, everyday, without any regard for what was actually happening in reality. I used weed to help me escape from reality. I finally worked up the BALLS to quit starting Jan 1 2020, and these last couple days have been tough! But I know that staying off the weed will help progress my career and life to what I want it to be. Here are some things that have helped me keep my mind off smoking and focused on REAL LIFE!

- breathing & mediation practice — I used to be dismissive of the benefits of meditation, but it really helps me calm down and refocus on what I need to accomplish. I listen to guided meditation that lasts about 10 minutes. 
- exercise! (Runners high feels amazing)
- journaling my thoughts etc
- focusing on the little things. (Keeping my space clean, drinking water, stepping outside and breathing fresh air etc) 
- find some hobbies! For me, I have picked up reading, yoga, sneakers, drinking tea, and I want to start boxing soon!
- keep yourself busy — easier said than done for sure, but being preoccupied with something all day makes my day fly by and before I know it, its time for bed!
- if you’re having trouble sleeping, try some melatonin or some tea before bedtime. Exercise will also help you fall asleep, your body will literally be exhausted and ready for bed. 

Those things have been working for me, may not work for you, but wouldn’t hurt to try right?

Lastly, I am grateful I found a place where people just like me can help each other through the struggles. Let us uplift and encourage anyone who decides that they want to make a change in their lives. 

Peace & Love,

Imagine each moment you live your life without relying on substances as taking another deep breath which you can now exhale into your Life’s balloon.  Each single clean breath inflates it, like a hot air balloon, preparing to rise up out of the current circumstances into the realm where you can really pursue your dreams.  No more Double Life.  No more compromised health.  No more taboos haunting you or your relationships.  

If you stumble, you haven’t lost, you’ve just let a little air back out of the balloon.  But you have ultimately let go of some of what you worked to capture inside.

I started this journey in August of 2018. I had been a daily toker since 1992 and I finally realized there was no more positives for me in that life.  By Feb this year I had made it to 6 months of freedom. 

I slipped up a few times over a couple of weeks mid February. I caught myself relatively easy, got back on track, and made it another 3 months.

Then this past summer I slid hard back into my daily weed rut. Staring with low % cartridges and working my way back up to the heavy waxes. 

Next thing I knew I was stuck in the mud and I wanted out bad. I missed all the positives that I had experienced away from weed over the past year.

One afternoon in late September I had enough. I wrote myself a new list of what I hated about weed and I checked in here on /r/leaves. 

I started the whole withdrawal thing again for a few weeks. I spent a lot of time reading and participating here as it seemed to help my momentum. I learned how important service to others can be as part of the recovery.

Over the past couple of weeks I have been on a long road trip vacation. I had done a similar trip a couple of years ago, but that time I was stoned the whole time and it went by in a haze.

This trip was different. the days felt thorough and I felt well rested every morning. I felt like I was able to be far more present.

My uncle was over last night and we were on the porch, he had his vape thing out and it smelled sooo good. I had also just had an argument with my aunt inside and was pissed off and tense (which is usually a cue to go smoke), but when he offered me a hit I just casually said no without missing a beat and continued talking to my cousin. Don't think I've ever done that before.

Still slept shitty again last night and still feeling tired, weak, weirdly emotional, and like I want to pick a fight with every person who walks by. But I'm working really hard on accepting all of these feelings as part of my recovery process - they're temporary, just like everything else.

Physical activity and journalling have been key so far. I do yoga every morning, try to work up a sweat and get my heart rate up at some point each day, and write in my journal every evening. I've started trying this 'gratitude journal' thing where you write down three positive things about your day/things you're thankful for that day. It helps to put things in perspective. Also a daily post here helps me feel accountable, and reading and responding to some of your posts helps me feel connected to a larger community of people who understand what I'm going through. So thanks for that :-)

Today I'm focusing on self-care. Tomorrow I will be in a difficult situation where I will likely be pressured to smoke, so I'm using today to build up as much momentum as I can and just try to feel really good about myself. Hope you all are working on feeling good about yourselves too.",9

I have been smoking weed for 8 years now and i finally reached the point where im going to quit with this shit

Currently i smoke 1-2g a day and i remember when i started this stuff that it was only a few times a month... 
It's crazy to see/realize how much influence weed had on my life in this period. I finally realize how much it obstructed me.

I've had some small breaks the past weeks where i tried not to smoke in the week. The insomnia sucks but its not the end of the world. What bothers me the most is how clear everything comes again once you quit with it. When 3 days sober stuff comes fully through again and with only 7 days sober i feel like my real self again...

But i fuck up in the weekends because i compensate with smoking shitloads weed 🙄
Thats my addiction problem... With me it's all or nothing. Like currently i've quit tobacco totally for like 9 months. But if i would take a puff from something with nicotine i would buy a pack of cigarettes the same day...

I also noticed that when im sober i feel much more angry... It kinda feels like a suppressed emotion but its very annoying since i raged like 2 times on my job to somebody the past weeks... I don't know how to deal with it but this will be my biggest problem the next weeks/days..

Spending my weekends not high on weed will be fcking difficult too... Everybody needs a bit of escapism and i don't particulary like alcohol. I also like to take some trips from time to time and i really like to smoke on them...

Does this sounds familiar to you guys? I really need some advice...

I've been lurking for the past few days and drawing strength from the success stories here, so first thank you to everyone for sharing your experiences and to the others for providing feedback and support. 

It's only been five days so I'd love to say I've been completely successful, but that's not the case. I haven't struggled much during the day, but as the evening wears on I get stronger cravings, I seem to have an excessive amount of energy even after exercising, and I'm having a hell of a time sleeping. Instead, I've been drinking wine or whiskey each evening to relax, but it's not enough to put me out (I rarely drink to excess, so I'd rather not anyway).

A few hours ago I broke and unpacked my box of smoking gear I had just cleaned and put away yesterday to try and get a hit or two out of my pen. After inhaling a few hits of burnt residue I realized how ridiculous I was acting and put it all away. I didn't get high, but now I'm feeling weak willed and a bit disgusted with myself.  

So here I am, preparing to itemize my history with cannabis for anyone reading this. Though. truthfully I just needed to get this bullshit off my chest as I'll likely reference this later for my own good. 

* I was 'straightedge' in high school along with a number of my friends, not to the point of being a dick about it to others, but we definitely held the opinion that drugs and alcohol were only a hindrance and not worth our time. We were all honor students with bright futures, it just didn't make sense.
* At 17, I managed to catch the attention of the girl I was absolutely infatuated with, who incidentally was a stoner, and we started hanging out pretty frequently. Eventually she asked if I wanted to get high with her, and my integrity and sobriety advocacy evaporated. We smoked quite a bit that night and I didn't get high, but there were many more sessions to come and it became a central part of our friendship for years which, for a myriad of other reasons, never resolved to be anything more.
*  I smoked a lot in college, as one does, usually making friends with people based on whether or not they also smoked, and even headed a chapter of NORML for a few semesters. 
* The peak of my usage in undergrad happened when I moved off campus and began renting a house. I had some shitty deadbeat roommates to be able to afford it, partying every night became the norm, and I eventually stopped going to most of my classes so I could spend more time fucking off and getting high. 
* I withdrew from university in 2002, telling myself at the time that what I really needed was a change of scenery; to go to college somewhere else. There might have been some truth to that, but I made that call without any plan to make it a reality, and instead spent the next four years working in kitchens and factories making barely enough to get by and feed my my cannabis habit.  
* During this time, I had a girlfriend who revealed after a year or so that she didn't like it when I smoked, though she could never articulate what she didn't like about it. It definitely ended up driving a wedge between us, but looking back she probably had a point, even if she didn't know how to articulate it. I was in my 20's and wasn't doing shit with my life. 
* In 2004 while on a road trip with some friends, we were pulled over for speeding in an infamous strip of highway, and the cop decided to run a dog around the car for reasons I can't explain aside from racial profiling (both of my friends were Mexican, in a place with virtually no Mexicans, and dude had neon plate lights). Dog slaps the door next to me, and I'm given a citation for the gram and one hitter I had in my pocket. 
* After attending court dates four hours away and paying thousands for a lawyer I couldn't afford, I was given a year of 'out of state probation'. This meant sending $200/month to the probation office along with a letter saying I'd been a good citizen, and at the end the charge was expunged from my record. Complete bullshit profiteering; I was drug tested once and never spoke to my PO on the phone. 
* My girlfriend was of course pissed when I told her, and with the citation now in her arsenal the idea of me never smoking again became her hill to die on. Not in a supportive way, but in a condescending, ""I'm so disappointed and can't be with a loser that does this"" sort of way. I submitted to her will and quit for about a year, but our relationship was struggling, I began to resent her control over me, and eventually began to smoke at a friends' place on nights she had to work late. 
* She found out, a huge fight ensued, and I broke up with her shortly after. I've read a number of posts here about people feeling they had lost relationships to cannabis, so I should clarify that I don't regret breaking up with her; it wasn't going to last anyway. I mention this because in some ways that dynamic shaped my relationship with cannabis going forward as something I had to enjoy at every given opportunity, since they were so limited when I was with her. 
* By 2006 I'd had enough of being a minimum wage slave and decided to finish my degree. I was still smoking daily when I could find it, but with far fewer friends left in town and a different living situation I managed to hold things together this time and graduated in '08 with a respectable GPA. 
* I landed my first professional job immediately after graduating, and thought to myself if I can do all of this and still smoke whenever I wanted, there's definitely not a problem. I started getting high before work in addition the evenings. The fact that I stayed at this job for over 5 years despite obviously being a dead-end position seems to indicate things weren't exactly as I seemed to believe.
* In 2010 I enrolled in and eventually completed a master's degree curriculum, excepting that I never finished my capstone project, and thus never got the degree. I was pretty depressed at the time, but I'm sure daily cannabis use didn't help with that or the constant procrastination. This is one of my biggest regrets, despite being of questionable value at this point in my career, and one I'll likely never rectify.
* In 2015 while attending a conference, I met a recruiter who offered me a job in Seattle. I accepted and moved about 1200 miles a few months later, despite having no friends or relatives anywhere near this part of the country. I was so excited about legal recreational cannabis and living outside of the Bible belt that it didn't seem important at the time. 
* As you can imagine, my cannabis usage skyrocketed after I moved. No more waiting for dealers or driving hours away to meet my friend in the city who always had the hookup. I could just roll into a dispensary down the street, drop down the cash, and smoke to my heart's content. I was going through about an ounce a month by myself, ramping up my tolerance until bong rips were the only method that got me sufficiently high. I'd go home on my lunch breaks and rip a few, and take a vape pen with me to work. I basically didn't want to do anything without getting at least a little high first. I also wasn't making any new friends.
* In early 2017 the budget for my position fell out and I was laid off; my first time being unemployed since age 15. I spent a few months searching until I found my current job, which I accepted despite a relatively significant pay cut. I told myself this was fine and I'd just continue looking for a better opportunity.
* I'm 37 now and life is feeling pretty stagnant. I know I could still get a better job if I applied myself, but my motivation is sapped after work every day, and I just come home and smoke most of the time. My girlfriend and I have talked about moving to another city, and even expatriating to another country, but I know how much effort that would take and can't bring myself to commit the time to it. I'll just rip the bong instead and start on it tomorrow, I tell myself.

I feel the main issue with my daily, perpetual cannabis use is it prevents me from reaching my potential both socially and professionally, which is something I've seen echoed countless times in this community. Though, those posts are often coupled with OP saying they are tired of living at home with their parents, not having a job, ruining relationships, gateway to alcohol abuse, eating unhealthy, etc. The cold turkey conversation seems to center on the idea that it's the only way to move past those limitations, that addicts are addicts and it's an all or nothing battle if you want to move on with your life. I see my own behavior reflected in this despite not having those particular issues, which is why I've committed to the idea of changing my habits, but the crux of all this is the inability to sleep issue is fucking difficult to tolerate.

I'm relatively successful in my career, live pretty comfortably, and despite some student loan debt, I have great credit and no anchors. My relationship with my girlfriend is healthy, and she has no issue with me smoking. But I'm depressed and lack motivation that I know I've mustered before. So when I read those posts the addict part of my brain screams, ""See! You aren't in the same boat, These people are addicts, you just enjoy it! Why do you think you need to quit anyway? You're doing fine! Now get your ass down to the dispensary before they close!""

As I'm writing this, it's 4 am and I still don't know if I'll be able to get to sleep. If I do it seems likely I'll wake up with night sweats again as I have the past few nights. I'm exhausted and wondering if I really need to go cold turkey or if I could get away with just cutting back to smoking only in the evening before bed. Of course, this sounds exactly like what I've seen mentioned here before, that the addict brain will try to persuade a compromise, so I remain conflicted. 

That's probably enough. If you made it here, you're a champion for making it through the unintended yet inevitable wall of text. If you have a similar story or advice to give in this context, I'd be happy to hear it. 

  
Thanks all.",6

I've been a daily vaper for a year and a half - it helped a lot with depression in the beginning, but for the last 9 months it's been counterproductive.

I quit alcohol and stopped bulimic behaviors on my own, cold turkey, and never looked back. This is different. I hate it and am so disappointed in myself for not being able to just quit. For the first time in my life I feel addicted to something, and I don't want to be dependent on anything, just on principle.

I don't even use large amounts (anymore), maybe 0,15 to 0,25 grams a day (I have weighted it), and still it feels like I cannot do this :(

Has anyone here quit by tapering off gradually? What kind of schedule did you follow?",3

This shit is harder than I thought it would be, and is really making me deal with a lot of feelings that I just wasn’t willing to deal with for the years I was smoking them away. 

But reading about people on here who say they made it 70 days, and 100 days clean,  talking about how much better they feel, and how the withdrawal isn’t forever, really helped pull me out of that isolating feeling that I otherwise would just numb away.

Weed isn't fun for me anymore. It feels like cotton balls in my head. With it comes the taste of regret. The time I got to a fun level using someone else's vape I believed people could hear my thoughts and were angels and demons. 

I want to start a business. And I can't do that with this addiction having it's strong hold on me. But I dream of weed. I feel so strongly the urge to use it when people around me do that sometimes I have to leave.

Vaped high THC strains daily, five times a day.  I was a good functional stoner. At some point though I had one paranoid induced high too many.  

So I quit (this was 2017).   And let me tell you it was fucking awful.  The first few months were a nightmare.  And the PAWS lingered for a long time.   The lack of sleep, extreme depression, night sweats, the nausea... the vertigo... you all know it.  It fucks with you.  One day you feel great and the next like shit.  

You know, I persevered and fully abstained and a year and half later I felt like nearly my old self again.   Sleeping good.  Felt “normal”.  Zero anxiety.  Just happy to lucky and sober to boot.  I was proud I fully quit.   

Two years later, what the fuck do I do.  I think, oh maybe I can handle a high CBD low THC strain instead.  Where I am they legalized it and we have legit shops with multitude of strains.  Curiosity gets me.  I miss weed.  

 So for a couple of months I was smoking a lot of that.   IT WAS NICE.  REALLY FELT LIKE MY OLD SELF.  Easy, Less overwhelming highs.  CBD is good for you right?

Well, I quit that During the Christmas season for financial reasons... and here I am again.  The anxiety is insane.  Mr. Withdrawal is back.     It’s been about two weeks.    I have a better handle on it mentally but Christ.  It fucking sucks.   Can hardly sleep, paranoid about my health, same shit.  Don’t make the same mistake I made.

I have crazy and vivid dreams that I remember. 
I have way better emotional regulation. 
My runs feel better, I'm not gasping for air. 
My eye contact isn't a problem anymore. 
Saved about $250 in the passed 19 days. 
I'm learning to rely on myself more than anything. 
I wake up not groggy. This is a big one. 
I'm not dependent on weed for anything anymore. 
I feel like if I can do this, I can do anything. 
Increased confidence. 
Better temperament. 
Less anxiety. 
I can articulate my thoughts more effectively. 

I've realized just how much I was relying on weed and how dependent I got whilst on it. Sales call? Roll a joint. Go for a hike? Hit the bong. Play music? Blaze up. Sabbath? Have an edible. 

I went cold turkey 19 days ago. From a heavy, habitual smoker to absolutely nothing. It felt like I had an intervention with myself and saw my life as having two roads from this point (19 days ago) forward. One road is me continuing to smoke and getting the same results I've been getting. Doing just good enough to get by but not squeezing the full potential out of the day and my life. I realized I was using weed as a coping mechanism habitually. And that terrified me. I could continue going down this road or I could choose the other path. 19 days ago I chose the other path. I don't know where this road will lead me but I know deep down, it's the right one. I know it's me against me. Period. I know that in order to fulfill my purpose on this planet, whatever it is, I need to be sharp and ready for challenges and opportunities with a clear, alert and sharp mind. I'm not just quitting to quit. I'm quitting so I can elevate my mental capacity to be ready for life's challenges and opportunities. It hasn't all been easy but everytime I'm tempted to smoke, I just think how terrible I will feel the next day. I've given up and quit so many things in my life. Not this. I'm not gonna give up and quit on myself. I look in the mirror and say not today, man. Don't give in. Know why you're doing this. You know where that first road leads, the one you've been on for years. You don't know where this road leads, the one of overcoming and resilience. I know it hasn't even been three weeks but I feel that if I stick with it, I will soon turn the corner and all this glorious stuff awaits me. There will undoubtedly be times where it's difficult, but with this win under my belt, with this victory over my urges, I will have the strength and resilience to overcome anything. 

To all those fighting the good fight, stick with it. If there was a reason to start, there's a reason to keep going.",89

The long term changes are going to take as long as they take, so in the meantime be happy for yourself for getting to this point.

When I use I am extremely anxious. I don't sleep well. My mood goes up, and then eventually down severely. I'm living in such chaos internally and externally. I feel like crap, and issues around me get worse because I am not tending to them. 

In the early period of not smoking...like at least for a week or so...I need a lot of rest and to take things slowly. That's just my experience. My body and mind has been shaken up so much, that I have to be gentle with myself and the process.

I feel like my energy is returning as I rest...but I don't have a lot of energy to do much.

Full disclosure, I've been diagnosed with a mood disorder alongside schizophrenia. I'm probably not going to bounce back like someone without those or similar disorders.

For me, right now...as much as I'd love to do a bunch of shit and get everything together in a jiffy...I have to go at my own pace, while at the same time trying to challenge myself to do what some might consider minor things (cleaning my room a bit, brushing my teeth, eating regularly, going the the store).

In my culture, it seems productivity and hard work is a high virtue. Sometimes rest and sleep and a slow pace are productive in their own way.

Well January 1st, I quit. I’m 4 days in and notice differences in my appetite, my sleep, my mood and quite the onset of what I am guessing to be anxiety. By day 2 I realized I smoke to cope with this illusion I have that I am “lonely” and smoking makes that thought and feel non existent. 


Day 1————
I kept busy and only every now and then thought about “why am I not high doing this right now”. I was happy all day. 
My appetite was extremely low, I only ate 1 time at 7 pm 
Sleeping? What’s that? Couldn’t sleep. Not a wink. I was completely tossing and turning. 
Woke up next morning with anxiety feeling in my stomach. 

Day 2———— 
Very very very emotional. I am either riding a high of happy or super sad and crying. This was the point I noticed that I equated alone time to being lonely and sad and therefore I should smoke the pain away. 
I had to force myself to eat, but I was not able to finish the food. My portions are very small compared to my usual portions.. munchies are real folks. 
Sleep was very rough. No sleep. 
Woke up next morning with that anxiety ridden feeling. 

Day 3———— starting to crash HARD
Was in a happy mood most of the day because I was looking forward to going to a social meet up - aka not being “lonely”. As I went to the social gathering my anxiety was unbelievable and I did end up leaving after 2 minutes. I hadn’t had such a rush of anxiousness in my life. I started crying from 9pm-12am. During this time I did begin to have some pretty dark thoughts, thoughts I have NEVER had. My mood swings are scary right now but to be expected during this period which brought me some comfort knowing maybe this was not my actual thoughts but withdrawal symptoms. 
Sleep: night sweats but shivering cold, woke up to a soaking pillow case watched the sunrise. I slept some but most of the night was me consciously aware of my tossing and turning. 

Day 4———- balancing out 
Appetite is back, ate a meal, a small meal nothing compared to the portions I was eating beforehand. 
The thought of weed is not on my mind. I’m having happy, focused thoughts and emotionally I am rebounding quickly. I feel I’m thinking really really clearly but slowly. 
I feel how exhausted I am likely from not getting good sleep. The past few days I haven’t “felt” tired enough to sleep. Today I soaked in a salt bath for 30 minutes to aid in the “detox” and that tired me out to the point I may take a nap. And maybe helped me to eat?

 I start talking too much with my stoner buddies about how much better off I am without weed, how everything's getting better and how weed was holding me back. I always frame this in the form of an ultimatum where weed was actually a horrible thing that's been fooling everyone. It has recently occurred to me how counter-intuitive this really is, though. Some people can have a drink occasionally while others are crippling alcoholics. Just because my life improves when I'm not abusing my drug of choice doesn't mean my experience is universal and I have discovered a hidden truth that my friends need to know about. Even worse when I fucked up in the past and got right back to smoking, these friends who I had previously raved about the joys of sobriety with just laugh or shake their head. And for good reason too; I'm being an inconsistent douche who can't follow his own life advice. This time I'm not saying dick about quitting to anyone except for this sub.

I do lots of sports so I always ate healthy food and pretty much aswell. Did anyone else go through this?

I’ve had enough of this cycle.","I’ve smoked fairly heavily for 17 years. When I first got to College, I was a completely different person. I was full of life, I had a personality, I could make people laugh, I had wit and it was easy. I had friends, women were romantically interested in me, I was...well, normal. I always struggled a bit with social anxiety, but when I wasn’t abusing weed, I could swallow those feelings and put on my extrovert mask and go to parties and still enjoy myself in social settings. I started smoking in high school, but I only really reached abuse-levels in college.

It was all downhill from there. I nearly failed out of college, and became gradually more withdrawn as my abusive habit grew. This led to my social anxiety inevitably taking a stronger hold over me. Weed only exacerbated that issue. I’ve been lonely for a long time. I had a friend here and there, but mostly I have just felt empty and lonely. I gained weight, stopped exercising and taking care of myself, and this affected my confidence which only made the social anxiety worse. By the end of college, I barely could recognize myself when I looked in the mirror.

When I wasn’t high, I hated myself. I hated the person I let myself become. And I could never find any other form of relief for this pain, the pain of self-hatred. The only relief was weed, which of course was the cause of all my issues. Even though I have smoked for 17 years, I’ve always been aware deep down of that fact, and how dangerous it was. Weed helped me forget the reality of all the career opportunities I’d lost, of how uncomfortable I felt in my own skin, of how alien I felt in social situations, of the damage I’d done to my mental and physical health.

Enough is enough. I will try to face my self-hatred and change whatever I have to change for these feelings to stop. I want a social life again. I want to be physically fit again. I want my personality back. Hey Mary Jane, seriously fuck you, you were an abusive lover to me in every possible sense. And I am leaving you. This is day 4 sober. I’m never going back to you.

I felt way less anxious at first. But months into daily wake and bake. It became horrible.

I was 19 when it started, and never experienced it. I was getting light headed every day but I did not think about it a lot. I figured it would go away. It has been almost 3 years since the first time and it has never gone away.

Around 8 months ago I said enough, weed made me like this and it has to stop! And I quit.

I still feel the same. Dizzyness, brainfog, can't concentrate and can barely go outside because I feel horrible. I have so much anxiety and somethimes it translates to anger/tantrum going into sadness.

I eat healthy. Take supplements and I workout. Started meditating again and try to learn new things. 

By now I hope i'd been cured and would be back to normal. But I am unsure if it will ever be. I hope it does but maybe I have done to much damage.

A year into daily smoking I developed depersinalization and maybe a small pyschosis. But that is almost gone for a while now. 

I have been to a dockter but she didn't help me too much but I did get my bloodwork done. This was all fine. And might go to a pyscholigst end of the month.

It got easier, but then I found myself struggling with mood related things, so I relapsed. I told myself I was only going to use it(shatter edibles) when I was really low... And then I just started using it nightly again, like my old ways. 

Found myself in that cycle again, and quit again. I made it 10 days before caving AGAIN. I couldn't handle the mood swings that came with the withdrawal. 

I owned that I needed help from my doctor. I now have a prescription for antidepressants, to help me through the withdrawal, and help me through life. I know it's bad to use that stuff... And we should avoid big pharma, but the fact is... I need help with this. I was getting very close to being non-functional with the depression and anger that would arise. I own that it was a mental health issue that lead me to my weed addiction in the first place, and I feel that the withdrawal symptoms are amplified because of unaddressed mental health issues. I've always been someone who numbs it out. However, I'm going to do it right this time. 

I have a great therapist that I see twice a month (all I can afford) I meditate, I do a gratitude journal every day, and I work out vigorously, and daily. I've always been active. But with all that hard work, I am still struggling daily with my moods. So, I went to the doctor. I caved in. 

I know, I know. Eventually I'll have to get myself off the antidepressants... Or will I? Because depression is a part of me. It's a part of my genetics, my grandmother suffered from depression as well. 

I don't know. All of this has just been a rant, because it's drilled into our heads nowadays that we shouldn't get into antidepressants, and that CBT therapy, and having tools I'm place to cope with those moods are the way to go. But those moods keep me from working, and socializing, and being able to genuinely laugh at something funny. Those moods make literally everything that anyone does annoying as hell. I haven't felt true relaxation in a decade, because I've always just been numbing. So that's it for now. Open to hearing comments and feedback.

The only withdrawal symptoms I'm suffering right now are insomnia, and sometimes I feel more angry than usual (usually when playing Madden or something lol). But that's about it.

As per the title, my new year’s resolution for 2019 was to quit smoking cigarettes.  It was obviously quite hard at the beginning, especially since my preferred method of getting high was through bottle tokes (hash+dart), but my partner smokes bong which made it easier to stop cigarettes, but I found myself smoking waaay more weed. I thought once I was over my cig cravings that I’d slow down on the weed, but it just seems to have escalated. Now I’m 4 years deep in what turned into an uncontrollable addiction, and I want out. 

So I set my calendar and was ready to start the new year sober... Except it’s day 4 and I still haven’t stopped. When I’m not high, I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, and my resting heart rate is like 100bpm. Thanks to this sub, which I’ve been lurking on for a few months now, I know this is all normal, and that eventually these withdrawal symptoms will fade, but I need help right now. I don’t have a very good support system outside of my own family because my main group of friends, my partner and our roommates are all stoners. I don’t want to confide in my family however because I don’t want them to know the extent of my addiction (for reasons). 

The only person on the outside looking in is my brother, in whom I’ve been able to confide the amount and frequency I smoke per day. My partner has been trying in their own way to show support, but I just feel like I’ll be pulled back into the bad habits if I listen to them.

I’ve always had a good job, a hobby and I still kept doing my day to day things while smoking. 

However what I’ve recently realised is I was never dealing with my sadness only masking it with the cannabis and since I’ve stopped everything just feels so much more painful. My brain is working in over drive and it’s driving me insane. The temptation to pick up today is unreal. I’m on my 3rd day of hardly any sleep, my appetite has completely disappeared and I have to force myself to eat. I’m over thinking more than I ever have. 

The worst is I have no one to talk to about it, people don’t understand. Cannabis has been my codependent for almost 5 years, it’s been my holy grail and now I feel completely lost with out a spliff in my hand.

Male, 21, Smoking since 13, addicted since just before 15, been to rehab for other drugs, high school drop out. Doing a lot better now, but, BREAKING: still have my vices. Apparently drugs are drugs, regardless of how much you vomit when you try to quit. 

Been here before, decided I was in a good enough place to live with weed, was wrong. Smoked my last couple of bongs today. There's no better time than now, I've run out of money and won't be able to buy weed until mid January so, may aswell harness my poor financial management and turn it into a life worth living. 

Just want to feel good again, fuck. I recently lived overseas for 3 months in a city where weed is legal and I wasn't doing it every day, was just doing it with friends maybe 4 times a week and holy shit, the difference in me was just absolutely blatant. Uber confidence, drive to just go out and do stuff, hell, I could swear my facial hair was growing in darker. I was the best version of myself. Ran out of money and came crashing back down to planet zombie, returning home and getting back into the same old shit with the same old people. I am still better than I was. I now know that there's absolutely a life away from this bullshit, but...

If I've learned one thing, it's that we as stoners work to create a barely translucent bubble of perceived comfort, a bubble full of cheese dust, masturbation, procrastination, financial irresponsibility, emotional distance, contentment with mediocrity and unwavering mounds of ""who cares what X thinks, I'm fine"" (X, by the way, is more often than not, you). It's very hard to see outside the bubble through the thick haze of smoke and delusion. 

I guess my point is that I lifted myself out of the bubble and the natural high of life was so much better than I could have ever imagined it, but my is bubble was so structurally sound, so passionately manufactured, it's almost like I put all my hopes, dreams, love and dedication into it and now I've got none left to build a sustainable, ongoing life. My bubble has a really, really pretty front door with a placemat that reads ""Welcome home"". When something makes me feel cold and dark, I know I can come home to my warm, safe place where cartoons and my right hand share the responsibility of keeping the door closed. I think I just need a warm jacket and a flashlight because as it turns out, it's fucking awesome out there.  Seemed to work for me before I , let's face it, relapsed like a true professional and went full-blown useless for a couple months there, right now included. I just wanted to iterate that in August, i made an entire network of new friends when I wasnt smoking every day, had some incredible experiences, did things all the time (wow!!) had more sex in a month than I had in 2 years, and now, a few months later, I get anxious when contemplating the very notion of catching a bus. Cognitive dissonance is a raging cunt.  

I wanna quit again. History tells us that talking about how I'm going to do it won't actually guarantee that I do it for some reason, so, I will try to be as practical and day by day as possible.

Cold turkeyed already about maybe 8 times since I became addicted. 

I know exactly what I'm in for. Won't be able to sleep tonight or eat tomorrow. The thing is, usually it would be fine for me to just stay awake all night and have a chill one tomorrow and sleep early to reset the sleep cycle (not a method that works for everyone but I do it now and again even when smoking) but I have to work because at the backend of last year I did fuck all (weed had absolutely nothing to do with this /s) and need to go in and catch up to avoid getting fucked by my bosses. 

What can I do to try and properly sleep tonight? I exercised alot today and know I need to not look at my phone etc. Has anyone found a cool thing aside from having a wank that gets them off to sleep?",2

When I was 16, I tried weed for the first time and I didn’t think much of it afterwards. Came legalization a couple days after my 17th birthday in October 2018 and thought about trying it again. I immediately felt in love with it and loved the relaxation and calm it gave me and it lasted pretty f**cking long (maybe in the range of 8-10 hours) but that was when I was first started smoking and I didn’t have much tolerance built up. I liked being high and started not giving a sh*t about school anymore even though I was a straight A’s student. Literally two months after it becoming legal, I started telling myself ""It’s legal what’s so bad about it"" and started buying more and more to satisfy my urge to smoke weed. Came summer 2019 and this was literally a downwards spiral for me. I started taking more and more weed and was literally in a vegetative state most of the time and I also started smoking at every moment I had. I felt like I had to smoke or I was missing out on something and kept lying to myself that I was more creative and I saw life from a different perspective. One day, I smoked in the forest next to my house before going to see my girlfriend. I never ever smoked before seeing someone that I loved and genuinely cared for. She was really sad when she figured out I was high out of my mind. Not sad because I smoked weed and went to see her, but sad because she didn’t recognise the guy she loved. I became obsessed with weed and prefered smoking with my ""friends"" rather than being with the girl I was happy with and by ""happy"" I mean the kind of happiness you live for and you really feel alive when you feel it. At this point, my life really just felt like it didn’t mean anything and I was just a spectator. I missed out on so many things and I regret it. Came my 18th birthday in October of 2019. This was really the period where I was at the worst. I was not seeing my girlfriend a lot and was smoking even more because I could buy it legally now at the local dispensary with my credit card when I didn’t have any money. Even though I kept a job, most of my money went to my addiction and junk food, so I didn’t really care because my stomach was full and my head was empty and at some point mid-November, I just realized life’s not about this. Life is not about lying on the couch all day everyday. Life was meant to be fulfilled and to make my dreams come true. My dream at that point was to learn programming and maybe make something that would be useful to other people and that would make me proud of. Proud, yes proud something I haven’t felt about myself in a long time. At that point, I wasn’t happy at all when I smoked weed it was even worse I just sat there high for an hour maybe two and every thought going through my head was that I was a miserable piece of sh*t. I stopped for a week-end and tried to learn a little something about coding that same week-end. Came out that I actually enjoyed it and I enjoyed it a lot I even felt proud of myself when I made my first computer program. Yes it was only a ""Hello World"" and not some fancy stuff but I looked at myself and said "" Wow, I really made this! I did this! I rock!"". And I went even deeper in my learning and not once have I thinked about smoking weed during my coding sessions. This didn’t last for long though. 2 weeks being sober and I wanted to taste weed again. That’s what I did, smoked weed again until Christmas break where I remembered my goal of becoming a computer programmer and make cool stuff! That’s the turning point, I realized weed was pushing my goals and my life and everything I enjoyed away from me. Weed wanted me all for itself, it didn’t want to share me and it didn’t want me doing anything else than playing with it. This is when I told myself I had to stop. I told my girlfriend about my projects and what I was going to do and she realised she got her man back. We started hanging out more often and my mood changed I felt more positivity in my life I was finally seeing the end of the tunnel and I enjoyed doing the kind of things that I actually liked. This is to say that I have finally made up my mind and I put myself and the people I really care for in first place now. Also, they have raised the age to buy marijuana from 18 to 21 starting January 1st this will probably help fight off any urge since I really want to stop smoking weed and live a better life!!!!!

Well, it’s been two months without weed (everyday smoker for the past 3 years) and it is so damn triggering to me.
So you try to reason with yourself, you say just accept the craving and move on just ignore it. 
But the thoughts still come and then they go, but then you’re faced again with another situation where someone brings up weed casually or you see it again on tv or social media and the cycle starts all over.
Quitting is hard. No one said it would be easy. 
Does anyone else feel this way? And if so, do the thoughts go away or do they stay? Do you have to constantly remind yourself that sobriety is the most important thing every single time?

I started 9 months ago and loved the euphoria and calm that weed gave me. However, once school started, I felt as if I was just smoking to get high and was not having that much fun anymore. I would smoke before anything that I was about to do (eating food, doing the dishes, driving, soccer practices and games). If I was going to use my mind in any aspect, I would want to be high using it rather than sober. This led to me being high 24/7 for the last 3 months. Parents caught me multiple times, but every time I would say that I was going to stop and that I was not doing it that frequently. Weed made me OK with lying to my parents about my emotions and led to me shouting and being disrespectful towards them whenever we would have a bit of an argument. 

10 days ago, I was forced into a T break because my family and I were going to Cabo for the full week. I knew that the first 3-4 days would be tough, but I kept in mind that I was going to get a lot higher than I used to when I get back home.  Surprisingly, the vacation to Mexico nullified any cravings that I would have. I think it was due to the sudden change in the environment and not having any paraphernalia on me. By the end of the vacation, I felt more connected to my parents than I had felt for in a while. Once I got back home, I smoked a bit and got really high, but I started to think about how I was acting with my parents for the last 6 months, and how all of that improved near the end of our trip. So I told them that I was still smoking and how I was going to try to stop now because of how I behaving with them.

The reason I say that I'm going to quit until I am 21 is that I do not know how it will impact me further i.e. my mental and cognitive ability. I fully accept that it has messed up my emotional strength and I do not want that to happen to my intelligence and memory. I think since I do not know the full extent of the drug's influence on a teenager's brain, I have a better reason and mentality to stop until I am 21. This has been that case with alcohol for me. Since alcohol has been researched more than weed has due to its legality, I have never touched alcohol since facts about alcohol are backed up with clearer evidence than for weed. I hope that I can use weed recreationally safely in the future the same way my parents use alcohol, but I do not think that I am able to fully grasp the extent of the impact it will have on me in the future if I continue to use it. I am open to any tips and stories that people want to share that helped them get off weed.",5

I've lurked on this subreddit a long time, but it's taken me a long LONG time to move beyond ""kinda wanting to quit"" to actually being ready. I'm about 3 weeks clean now, but tbh, it was essentially a forced break and I want to keep on without out.
    
I've been a daily smoker for about a decade, and about 18 months ago I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. At that point, I leaned on weed even more heavily and easily justified it to myself that it was ok because I needed it to get through the treatments. I had my (hopefully) final major surgery 3 weeks ago, reconstruction, and was in the hospital 6 days. And I've been so dazed and out of it from recovery, painkillers and the like that I wasn't able to smoke even if 11 I wanted to. So that's how I've hit the 3 week mark relatively easily, but I know it will get harder.
    
There are so many reasons I want to stay off weed. As I'm sure many can relate, I feel like over time it became my defining personality trait. My tolerance was sky high, I was wasting so much time, and the mental pressure of justifying it to myself is relentless. I have tried to moderate many times in the past, but I just can't control myself with it. It needs to be a full stop.
    
This last surgery was the most major I've been through and it's really shook me how frail and weak I still am, so that's motivated me to continue on not smoking. I genuinely want to be healthier and take better care of myself. But I'm scared too. Whenever I've tried to quit before, I get super depressed. It sounds so lame, but I've always felt weed made a more ""fun version"" of me. Life always feels so boring and meaningless without it.
    
So that's where I'm at right now. I'm feeling okay, but I'm scared at any minute that old instinct is going to take over. Sorry for the long ramble everyone! I wanted to actually make a post to help make it more official in my head, and help keep myself accountable. Thanks for reading and any encouragement!",2

I just wanted to share my personal experiences everything else was manageable , you know the whole food thing little bit of emotional during the first couple weeks, definitely the sleeping very vivid dreams, but the worst part of it for me has been the headaches and the dizziness.

Went to the doctor he said I'm fine as far as he knows, and that it's to be expected different people withdraw in different ways, I figure it's from my brain chemistry trying to get back to normal after 15 plus years of smoking.

Guys I am not sure what the point of this post is exactly. I guess I just want to hear from some people who may have gone through what I am going through. 

&nbsp;

Throughout the last 5 years or so, Ive quit weed many times, but I never seem to get it together before I slip and smoke again. I cant seem to find the drive and ambition I had before I started smoking heavily/daily, then I end up just going back to the weed.  The last time I quit weed, I wanted to go back to school and finish what I had started. I discovered though that I would basically need to start over and go to school for anywhere between 5-8 years. Wont give the details on why because I dont want to make this longer, but if you ask Ill break it down in a comment. This derailed me and I went right back to weed.
 
&nbsp;

I've had a pretty rough decade. The only driving force of love, support, motivation, encouragement, positivity, and discipline in my life was my mom. 2010 hits and shes diagnosed with cancer. By 2012, she was dead. She went out painfully. This literally happened at the most important transitional period of my life, which was high school graduation and the start of college. To say I was completely lost as to what to do with my life from there would be an understatement, and I lost the only person who would help me succeed in getting through. The next 6 years I lost at least 1 member of my family to death each year back to back. 

&nbsp;

Depression and a loss of purpose is what I've dealt with and I treated it with weed. Its kept me complacent in life and I've watched dreadfully as my family and friends build their lives and move forward while I am left behind. I've decided to quit again and thought the start of the new year would be the perfect way to do it. I haven't smoked since. I should mention that during the times that I have quit weed, I have regularly worked out, ate right, read more, and been more social. Some of these things I still do right now. 

&nbsp;

My problem however always lies in the fact that I dont know where to go from here. Its like my drive and ambition from 10 years ago has never returned even after all my weed-quitting stints. The belief that I can truly turn my life around, find meaning in life, and be proud of myself for succeeding is just not there. It just feels like turning my life around and SETTING goals, let alone achieving them, seems so impossible. I am only 26 and I feel like I've missed the boat in life.

I’m not expecting anyone to sit and read it all, I’m doing this to cement everything into place for myself, that being said any support and advice from people would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve been in a seemingly endless downward spiral for the past few years, a break up with my first love catapulted me into an abyss. I’ve suffered from mental health issues my entire life, but have only become aware of them recently. I have never been able to deal with stress, I collapse and push everything away. Everything from that point just got worse in my life, I lost close friendships, felt utterly alone and as if I had no purpose in life. I was anxious all the time and a shadow of my former self. This was when I discovered weed. It started for me in the same way that I imagine it happened for most people on this sub, a fun thing to do with friends. I just replaced drinking with smoking, instead of the pub we chilled and smoked; it seemed harmless and gave me something to enjoy and look forward to again. But then overtime, without even realising it, it started to consume me. At the time that it started to become an issue I was living completely on my own, all of my flatmates had left and it was just me. I wasn’t anxious when I smoked, my depression seemingly gone in the fleeting moment of distraction it gave me; it was my release and my escape, but my get out of jail free card slowly started to become my prison. I started smoking on my own, then for longer time periods, then more weed at a time. It had started to snowball and I lost control. I moved into a new house and about two weeks after, my housemate moved in. I had been doing better, barely smoking in the time I was on my own in the new place, then when he came back I suggested we have a welcome back smoke. This was when it really began to destroy my life.

We were smoking everyday, but it was just a joke. “Wouldn’t it be funny if we went a whole week smoking everyday?” one of us said, then a week became two, then three, then month, two months, three months; you get the picture, it was no longer a joke. Meanwhile my life was continuously going down hill, my mental health was deteriorating and I chose to smoke the pain away instead of biting the bullet and confronting my issues. I was convinced at the time that it was helping, it felt like it was because in the moment of being high I felt okay and I was high all the time. But I wasn’t. Everything was getting worse because nothing was being addressed. I wasn’t paying attention to anything or anyone outside of my own living room. Then I became so used to being high that my anxiety when I wasn’t skyrocketed. I’ve had to leave multiple jobs due to issues with my mental health, yes I suffered from it already and struggled with work, but smoking all the time just made it even harder to deal with. I had periods of being off sick or just unemployed, I had no money coming in but you bet I was still finding ways to buy weed. I didn’t pay rent, bills, barely ate, borrowed money from friends, defaulted on loans and credit cards, yet I was still totally blind to my issue. I kept saying it was everything else, all my other issues and weed was the miracle cure that I needed, “God knows how bad I would be without weed” I used to think to myself a lot.
I started dating the physical embodiment of all my wildest dreams, a girl that I could spend eternity talking to you about and still have more to say about her. 

Someone who has cared about me like no other, she offered me all the help and support in the world and I just took advantage of her. I was just too high and oblivious to see what a cancer on her life I had become. A few months into our relationship I imploded, everything became too much and I detached from reality. It was build up of unaddressed issues that had been piling up and up and eventually the stack fell. Nothing felt real, everything was confusing and terrifying. She offered all the help in the world and more but I rejected it, I didn’t need it I thought. I became an emotional husk. I pushed her away and treated her like dirt. Yet, she still stood by me; and she did until it was physically and mentally impossible for her. I destroyed her. Meanwhile I was just smoking myself further into my ever expanding internal void. I’ve never spoken to anyone about how much of an issue smoking was to me. Everyone around me knew I had a problem, but not to the extent it was. I relinquished all responsibilities and became a selfish, arrogant person who cared about nothing more than when he could next smoke. I neglected her needs and made everything about myself. I did things I never thought I was capable of and I wish more than anything in this world that I could undo the damage and hurt I caused. After she finally left me I fell even further, using the same old “why always me” and “life is so unfair” excuses to justify my smoking and push the accountability away from myself. At this point I had gotten to smoking around 4 grams per day. I’ve had to defer my final year of university and lost an amazing job. I had fallen so far from myself that I wasn’t even worthy of being in the shadow of the person I used to be. I was at the point of real and serious plans of suicide. I’ve ruined everything around me and brought those who remained around me down too. But, there I was still smoking, because it “helped”. I had moments of clarity and self awareness about what smoking had done to and kept trying to quit, but the second I became anxious again I would pick up without even a second thought.

I had been “cutting down” on and off throughout December and managed to cut it down to a gram or two per session. On New Years eve I did what everyone does, make a promise about the person I was going to become next year. I thought it would be perfect, I was going to a small house party where no one smoked, I could have a few drinks and I would be fine. I was, for most of the night. But as the clock hit midnight and I looked around the room to see I was the only one on my own, I fell. She came into my mind and all the pain came back. I don’t even remember messaging my dealer but the next thing I knew I was back at mine rolling a joint. Convinced that this was what I needed, but the second I put it to my mouth I screamed at myself in my head “fuck you”. I sat in an existential crisis about what I have become for a time period that could’ve been 5 minutes or 5 hours, I wasn’t in reality. I decided to punish myself. Punish myself for being the weak human I am. I smoked all three grams of it in the space of 30 minutes. I wanted myself to feel the damage I was doing to myself by smoking. I made myself physically sick, but carried on and made myself finish it. The next day I woke up feeling awful. But it worked. I want to be better and I will be better. 

I’ve set myself a daily schedule to make me eat, exercise and actually do something with my life. I have a set time to get up and if I’ve been up all night before then tough. I have a job interview next week and I am going to throw everything I possibly can at it. I need to be better and I will. I am going to push myself even when it all feels pointless, even in my darkest moments. This is it. My promise to myself, my friends, my family and to her; to be the person I know I can be. I know I can never take back the damage and hurt I caused those around me, but I am going to do everything in my power to make amends and be a better me. I am sorry to all of those who I have hurt. I want to be better and I will be better, I just hope I can have the chance to show everyone, and especially you, that I am not that person. I can be better. I will be better. That is my promise.",5

I have been smoking weed since 4 years and it all was started during my second year of graduation 
At first I just wanted to try it to know how it feels like 
and ended up addicted to it
During my final year of graduation at the time of exams I had to really stop smoking and it was like hell to me and I got to know how fucked up I am 
But I didn't stop then and during my internship my only focus was getting high all the time 
During that time I had a breakup with my girl which took me more into smoking pot 
And now I am out of the college and had to prepare for masters but I was smoking since I left the clg which is almost 8 months 
All I do is wakeup ,smoke all day,watching random shit,fapping
When I think about past 3 years there was never progress in my life
So I had been trying many things to get out of this life
Now I decided to go home be with my parents because I know that I am obviously not gonna smoke when I get there in two days 
I really need to change now 
Please wish me",1

I quit once to get into the IBEW apprenticeship, but used alcohol as a crutch and became a severe alcoholic for 5 years. I lost everything! Kicked out of the apprenticeship 6 months before graduating, lost my apartment, had to move in with mom for a while. To quit drinking (3 years sober) I went back to smoking weed and I am now a burnout. I stutter, have extreme short term memory loss, social anxiety, no dates, groggy, lazy, grumpy, bad tempered. I don’t really have any friends either because I prefer to be alone when I’m stoned. Still an electrician,(non union) I was recently fired from my job because I refused to work any overtime because I wanted more time to be home and get stoned. I have enough saved to get me through April, so while I’m unemployed I’m trying to heal up. Giving myself a chance and maybe I can quit being such a loser. This is only my second day, but can’t wait to get more time between me and that stuff. Feeling pretty bad today, but not as bad as I thought. No crutches this time!

I’m not expecting anyone to sit and read it all, I’m doing this to cement everything into place for myself, that being said any support and advice from people would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve been in a seemingly endless downward spiral for the past few years, a break up with my first love catapulted me into an abyss. I’ve suffered from mental health issues my entire life, but have only become aware of them recently. I have never been able to deal with stress, I collapse and push everything away. Everything from that point just got worse in my life, I lost close friendships, felt utterly alone and as if I had no purpose in life. I was anxious all the time and a shadow of my former self. This was when I discovered weed. It started for me in the same way that I imagine it happened for most people on this sub, a fun thing to do with friends. I just replaced drinking with smoking, instead of the pub we chilled and smoked; it seemed harmless and gave me something to enjoy and look forward to again. But then overtime, without even realising it, it started to consume me. At the time that it started to become an issue I was living completely on my own, all of my flatmates had left and it was just me. I wasn’t anxious when I smoked, my depression seemingly gone in the fleeting moment of distraction it gave me; it was my release and my escape, but my get out of jail free card slowly started to become my prison. I started smoking on my own, then for longer time periods, then more weed at a time. It had started to snowball and I lost control. I moved into a new house and about two weeks after, my housemate moved in. I had been doing better, barely smoking in the time I was on my own in the new place, then when he came back I suggested we have a welcome back smoke.

2020-01-03 12:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ejj0m6/my_story_i_appreciate_your_advice/,"My story, I appreciate your advice","This about my problem with marijuana. I'm a senior in college right now, I took my first hit of weed the summer going into senior year of high school. I had always had 2-3 good friends growing up, but the summer going into senior year I started to make a crazy number of friends, got invites to all of the parties, started to get some attention from girls, and became pretty popular at school - which all of this to my very immature brain felt like this was as good as life could be. I bring all of this up, because this was directly correlated to me starting to smoke weed. I was no longer seen as the quiet kid that no one really knew anything about, and was now the latest, greatest pot head. 

It stated with a few hits at the beginning of the summer. I didn't smoke again for a couple of months because I didn't have access, and wasn't craving it. Then I met my new friend group, and all they did was smoke weed, and so I did with them probably 5 times a week, but then when school started back up I was a serious student and only smoked with them Fri-Sun. Then that changed towards the end of the school year...I started incorporating Thursdays because it's almost the weekend, and then I started incorporating Mondays because Monday sucks and we gotta brighten it up. By the time I started my freshman year of college I was smoking minimum once a day, and over the next three years I got to a point where I was smoking at least three times a day on average - yeah, there was about a 6ish month stretch there where I was sober for maybe an hour a day. It just felt so good and I would stop stressing about whatever I was stressing about, music would sound so much better, I would ""have fun"" eating, and everything and everyone around me was hilarious. 

This past summer I didn't smoke weed for the first day in years when I went on vacation a few hours up north with my parents a few times. They were only 2-3 day trips each time, but I wanted to a) prove to myself that I could actually go a whole 2-3 days with no weed and b) my parents have never explicitly said they know about the weed, but I know they do and I know they don't like it, so I didn't wanna make the vacations awkward. Anyways, I noticed I was getting super irritable and having a tough time sleeping but I also noticed I felt a lot smarter, a lot wittier, I felt so much less anxiety, I wasn't wasting time thinking about what everyone thought about me, and I just felt more sharp. 

However, at the end of the trips, I would always smoke literally the instant I got home, I just couldn't wait. And this carried over to this school year...I would smoke every morning (before my workout if I was lifting that day, and after if I was running because it'll fuck with your lungs.) Then I would smoke again at least one more time before bed, but it was usually 2-3 more times. 

Over the past couple of months I've been thinking a lot about all of the negatives weed has been doing to me. I get anxiety almost every time I smoke, I think about every single negative social interaction or ""did he/she think what I said/did was stupid?"" every time I smoke, the idea of socialising was just not a thing, every time I saw an attractive woman I would want to leave wherever I was because I knew being high would make it way too hard to talk to her and if I did talk to her I'd have out of this world anxiety the whole time and if she rejected me that's all I would have on my mind for the next week  or so, I would lose interest in everything besides listening to music, I wouldn't be able to think of anything witty to say until minutes later when I'm on point sober, etc.

Well I got my wisdom teeth out one week ago today, and you can't smoke for a week when that happens. Of course, the first thing on my mind was ""we need to go to the dispensary by campus and get enough edibles to last a week, asap."" So I did. But also keeping in mind my growing unhappiness towards weed, I decided I'd only eat them at the end of the day to unwind, have a couple of fun hours, and be able to sleep. 

I've officially ran out of edibles, but I'm also free to smoke now, too. Anyways, I was planning on doing my work from home gig for a while, and playing around with Flopzilla all day, then I have a political discussion club I go to that's meeting tonight. All I was thinking about during my workout today was, ""if we're only doing weed once a day, and avoiding it before social interactions, when the hell are we gonna have time to smoke."" And that's when I finally broke. I have a problem. People that don't have problems aren't devoting time/thinking it's a problem as to when they'll be able to smoke or not. 


So with that being said, I have fully realized that I need to make changes even deeper than just smoking once a day. I'm not gonna smoke today, but where does this end? I don't foresee myself smoking tomorrow either because I'm hanging with my cousin, then I'm gonna play poker for about 6 hours, and there'll be no need to because I'm gonna go to bed after my session. I could definitely see Sunday night working out as an acceptable time to smoke, but does it even make sense to? Will I just be on a slippery slope that's going to make me want to just start smoking again every day, and slowly into twice a day, to the point where I smoke 3x a day again? I'm nervous because I've had sooooo many fun memories smoking, and I am a sucker for going for a several walk on a nice summer night after I smoked listening to music. I don't want to forever give up smoking weed, but I will 100% say that smoking weed never is better than smoking every day, so I'm really in a pickle, and unsure of what to do. Do you think it'd be fine to just try and only smoke on days like this coming Sunday where it's harmless to smoke because I'll just be doing leisure activities anyways? Do you think I should commit to a month cold turkey and then see from there if I want to smoke when there's nothing else to do for the day besides liesure activities? Does anyone have anything like a similar experience to this?

I'm also nervous because I know if I go cold turkey I will be super irritable indefinitely, I will have trouble sleeping, and I will get random spells of sheer sadness. I also know my anxiety problems won't go away like magic, and  
my horrible incompetence with women won't go away either, so I might just feel worse as a whole, I fear. I remember when I quit caffeine a few years ago, I went in with the plan of just drinking caffeinated drinks when I felt like it after I broke the physical addiction, but after a few dips with caffeine again I said fuck it and literally haven't drank caffeine once in ~3.5 years. I also never got addicted to alcohol, even though I was drinking every weekend my senior year of high school. I only drink alcohol ~ once every six weeks now and I'm totally happy with it and never crave it.",2

My bros went to the more party oriented of the two state schools, and I went to the ag. school further north so my use decreased from those multi-sesh days. Probably freshman and sophomore year I smoked the least, typically not weekdays and often not for weeks, being too busy trying to navigate college as a 1st gen student. Once settled though, it slowly started picking up again.

In grad school it got even worse. Coming from a fam who's broke af, stress from working two jobs and full time classes made it easy to justify rippin one down at the end of the day. Sure, I couldn't remember my last captivating dream, but at least it felt nice. It didn't feel so nice dating women who didn't smoke and making excuses to get away and chill at home.

Fortunately I have a great job, awesome work experience, know fantastic people, and have been fortunate to find myself in some pretty cool rooms. Unfortunately, most - if not all - of that is possible because I hide that I smoke. Nowhere I want to go in life would be better with me also continuing to smoke.

So here it is, new years eve. Cue great parties, exciting friendly people, and a thought that maybe it's finally time to stop? Champagne pops, lean in for the midnight kiss -- catch the awkward eye of the open relationship boyfriend lol -- , and uber home at 4am to plop down on the couch and, again, light one up.

I don't know why I can't stop if it seems so clear.",5

However, psychologically, you still have memories of you being high, you still remember what it was like the first time, you have fond memories of the drug. I find that the longer I go without weed, the more my brain focuses on the positives of weed rather than all the negative aspects of it, which is not healthy in the long run and may lead to a potential relapse. So stay strong  fellas, keep reassuring yourselves that this is not a drug of self improvement or enlightenment, it is something to dull the bad feelings.",43

My gf at the time would smoke every day, and I started smoking with her every day. When our relationship became more toxic, I would smoke to numb my anger towards her for the way she treated me. 

I'm finally done with her, but not done with this addiction. I have a lot of other friends who smoke all the time, and every time I tell them I want to try to stop they don't take me seriously. 

Their reasoning? I don't smoke enough for it to be a problem. I buy an 1/8 a month, but I still seem to have a low enough tolerance that it gets me FAR. I smoke every day, and I'll be out of it for a whole evening off of a small amount. (Im thinking this might be because I'm on SSRI antidepressants.) 

Regardless, its hard to feel motivated to quit when some of my best friends laugh in my face when I say I have a problem... Simply because I don't have as big of a problem as them. 

Curious if anyone else has gone through this. It's hard to stay motivated to quit when that drive is invalidated by those around you.",1

I had a peak And to my 2019 in a financial way, I've never been good with money, my dad has always said, I'll never have any money asking as I got a hole in my ass, from the day I could earn pocket money he has said that, I'm now 26...-,-
Anyways..
Due to my not so good end to 2019 due to money, I have decided to seriously cut down the amount of ganja I'm smoking. I've smoked it for over 11 years now, the last 7 of them have been a daily routine, first thing when I wake up, smoking during work, smoking after work..it has really taken over my life. 
I have a medical condition, crohns disease. I'm in the UK so medical cannabis is not a question, so it's always been out of my back pocket. I havent been to hospital for my corhns for so many years now, but i've sometimes thought over the last 5/6 years about maybe stopping or cutting down but deep down, I've always known I never wanted to. I've always blamed it on that fact that if I was to stop medicating, then my crohns could start to flare up again..so I am pretty worried about that aspect of it..
2020...I am now on day 2 of cutting back.. usually I would smoke atleast 2 ounces of green a month, minimum..yesterday I had 4 medium sized j's and I've just put my 2nd one out from today. 
Going from 12+ j's a day, to 4 yesterday and a couple today has been hard...I've already started snapping in mood and getting angry, my stomach has been cramping, i can feel myself getting emotional too....and I'm not even cutting weed out 100%?! 
I am so determined tho, I want to save my money, I don't ever want to cut weed out my life for good, I just need a serious reality check on the amount I'm consuming.",1

The first couple of days were fine, and I wasn't worried- I had done this before. 

Day 5 brought on panic attacks, heart palpitations, nausea, sweating- I couldn't stop shaking, and though I didn't vomit I was constantly dizzy and felt like I was walking on uneven ground. I've even experienced some depersonalization and derealization, and vivid nightmares in the last couple of days. I've woken up in the throes of a severe panic attack several times. I've used a whole bottle of Lorazepam- a drug to help with my anxiety- in the last week, though I've had the bottle for several months.  Even now I'm shaking as I write this, dizzy and nauseous.

I did some research and PAWS (Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome) seems like the likely answer, though I don't want to diagnose  myself. But I am so, so tired- I can count two times where I actually enjoyed myself on this vacation, as I've holed myself up in my room to try and sleep or not overwhelm myself. 

PAWS symptoms apparently can take up to two years to be alleviated, and just the thought of going through this for that long is killing me inside. Has anyone ever experienced this? Did you end up smoking again? Did you stop again and the same thing happened?

I have so many questions and I am so scared and overwhelmed with it all. I'm having a hard time believing it's worth it to quit fully.  If anyone could help me in any way they can, I'd appreciate it.",3

I stayed with them for the week of christmas, and they're visiting me during the new year. 

My mom has known that I've smoked recreationally and have quit, but didn't know that I was consuming a gram cart in two weeks or less. My dad works for the government, and he knew that I've tried it before, but I couldn't tell him anymore than that due to his job. 

Well tonight, after a discussion about weed prices here in Oregon because my roommates were smoking last night when they dropped me off, I came clean. My parents were both understanding, and I feel that they really cared about me staying sober, and that I could reach out to them more about it to make sure I stay accountable. I wouldn't have made it this far without this sub, and I told them that although I'm not going to a group for support, I've always felt supported and strong about my decision because of this sub.

So thank you for holding me accountable, and for being my rock when I didn't think I had family to support me. I'll still be here posting all the time tho! Stay sober my friends :)",5
2020-01-03 00:34:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ejay4m/day_1_and_so_it_goes/,Day 1. And so it goes...,"Hi. I know this is backwards but it’s so much more intimidating for me to post this here than it would be if we were face-to-face. I’ve always felt a bit awkward about these spaces, like I’m flinging myself into the void, subjecting myself to criticism from strangers.. 
Still.. Tbh im a bit desperate, and pretty overwhelmed, so.. thanks for reading my story, I know it’s a bit lengthy.. 
I’ve been smoking weed on and off for over twenty years, very much on for the last 5. Daily, with some short breaks here and there. I live in the mountains of CO, so partly it’s easy to justify bc it’s an INTEGRAL part of mountain culture. And for a while, I felt like I managed it in a pretty ‘balanced’ way.. I smoked basically every night to sleep (I’ve had insomnia since puberty, and feel like weed really helps, but I think these days it makes it worse?), but wasn’t always much of a day-smoker, and made sure I took a little time off from it semi-regularly. I drank and partied some, but this too felt managed and within the accepted cultural norms of mountain livin’.  I’ve been through some pretty extreme shit, and felt like I’d developed a hearty bag of healthy tools to self-care, not limited too, but including, weed.
And then, in 2016, my littlest brother committed suicide. It was my 3rd week of marriage (I’ve a super close big fam and our wedding was the last time any of us saw my brother). Needless to say, it absolutely fucking devastated me. Like losing a limb, or maybe a heartbeat. There would be these times (daily?) when grief became so unbearable that it was like I couldn’t think or process or even breath. In those times, weed saved me. It put me in a bubble just thick and safe enough to find perspective, see people, even eat.. it helped me to find my heart center, to hear my brother.. I felt like I’d landed on a strange dark planet, and weed helped me to find some light. I was and am so grateful. 
Now.. here I am a few years later, day 1 of quitting, maybe forever? I’m honestly scared, but I know I need to at least try. Weed is no longer the healer and guide it once was.. I’m not sleeping well, I’m drinking more than ever, still grieving deeply, and I feel like I’m blatantly using weed to escape. I’m ready to show up to my life a bit more. 
So, day 1. We happen to be en route to my grandmothers funeral, the timing is rough, but I’m sticking to it. It’s time. I’m tired of feeling constantly dehydrated, forgetful, checked out. Tired of needing to smoke in the middle of the night just to keep sleeping. Ready to have my life back, even if it’s messy and hard. 
It’s so good to read all of your posts, it helps me to feel less scared and alone. Thank you.

I am 29 years old, turning 30 in 2 months.
In 15 years I've probably not smoked for a total of maybe 6 months( a few days here and there). I was so in love with weed, that just until a couple of months ago, quitting was never an option. 
And since I also sold it for 10 years, I always had an abundant supply, and basically was smoking almost for free. But nothing is free, I have realised that now.
It took away so much time away from me it is sad.

A month ago, I realised how much of my life I was actually losing. I work 5 days a week, but I was never sober. No savings, no future plans. When I lived with my family, I'd come home late and lock myself in the room for fear of my mom seeing my bloody eyes.
My mom even told me once that she felt that I was just a hotel room tenant, and not her son since I had so little contact with my family while home.

Since I started during high school, it made me prioritize wrong friends instead of staying in class, i would rather meet them and smoke up some weed.

Have been awake for 3 days straight now, can't sleep and can't eat anything. I went to work today, but i couldn't work because of insomnia, so i had to go home straight away.

I feel like i have made the right choice in quitting, because i now see all the negative things it has done to me, and it does not serve me at all. I was basically it's bit**. 

Hope I have the strength to become totally clean and never look back.

Yours sincerely,

I'd question myself how good did smoking weed even make me feel? I've acknowledged that I do have an addiction. I know I cant relie on weed to make me feel good forever, and I've grown to dislike how it stifles my desire to try new things as it would make me feel comfortable in my bland life routines.

My addiction is even at the point where it worsens existing health problems and even tho I'd see this I would still smoke regardless.

So I've decided to change for a brighter future. It's only been 2 days, it's been a little hard to sleep, and I've been feeling kinda down.

I know, it's messed up... Tried quitting before (also posted here). Lasted for 3 months and relapsed again. I don't drink, i only smoke weed and cigarettes. (Which makes my addiction worse) i am smoking every single day.
It just makes me sad when thinking about my teenage years.. always smoking, smoking, smoking. Sometimes i just think where i could have been in my life when i didn't started this damn drug. Probably graduated already, good job. Now im just the guy who is always late, who doesn't come to class and is taking 5 years for a bachelor degree which is normally 3. Im isolating myself when smoking alone. I am smoking to escape reality. When i drive to work in the morning, the only thing that goes trough my head is just smoking when i come home.
I never wanted to quit because i was always thinking: i can't quit already, i just want to lay down smoke 'one last time' and make this the perfect moment. But sad reality doesn't give you this moment. Life is grey trough the eyes of a stoner, and it'll stay grey. 
Also, I have this constant brain fog and it is affecting everything in my life. Even when i quit for 3 months, i still experienced this stuffed feeling in my head. It really scares me and im doubting if it'll ever go away. I want to read books, write books, learn other languages, write papers, socialize with new people, but this feeling in my head is just blocking everything. That's why im hating weed so much. My brain must be damaged from smoking too much. Will it repair itself?

It makes me sad, too sad actually.

But im not giving up, hopefully i will remember 2020 as the year i quit weed.
Any ex-smokers in here who quit cold turkey after smoking for over a decade? And lasted from day one?
Anybody who knows anything about this brain fog im having? Will i ever have a clear mind again?
Any tips, advice, thoughts? 

Sorry for the grammar, english is not my mother language.

2020-01-02 21:43:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej8vxe/eye_opener/,Eye opener??,"Sorry this may be a bit of a longer story but to start I had actually been using thc since I was 14 yrs old. My dad is an ex military Afghanistan war and would use it to cope with his ptsd. However he ended up getting super deep into int, and grew for a while in our basement. He had a whole bunch of plants and jars upon jars of bud. When I was 10 or 11 I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression, and social anxiety. I figured that since it helped my dad with his ptsd, that it may help me with the issues I had as well. So when I was 14 I tried to make teas, and stumbled upon edibles (hard candies) in the basement. I didn’t do that often but I remember it would help me to fall asleep. 

Once I turned 16 I actually started smoking when I worked fast food, with a bunch of coworkers. Again it wasn’t often but it quickly became more frequent as time went on. For the longest time I had convinced myself that it was ok to use it because it was helping with my mental illness, and helping me connect with more people. 

But around the time when I was 17 or 18 it became a daily habit, and then smoking multiple times a day. I would lose interest in things I enjoyed like art, and reading, and music. I stopped showing up to school because I didn’t really care much about anything. I slept with a bunch of people because of that same lack of care, and let myself be used and stepped on. I lost the majority of my friends and realized the ones I had left were just using me for the weed I carried around and for a good time. 

The biggest eye opener for me was when I ended up totaling my first car on my way home from working night shift at a warehouse. My mom came and picked me up and as soon as she left for work again, I turned to the bong and bottle. I sat on my front porch and the more I smoked that day the more I realized how little I thought of myself, and how little I thought of generally everything. I lost care for my family and friends and my job and school. 

Once I was finally able to get a new car, I decided that it was time to drop it and quit. Since then I’ve been trying to smoke less and less, along with quitting my nicotine addiction. I’m about a month clean from weed, but I plan on being clean for a lot longer. I really need to figure myself out, and learn how to care for things again. I need to take care of myself and find the motivation to get better instead of running from my problems, by numbing them. 

So thanks to those who read through this, I know it was long. I just found this subreddit and found it inspiring to see everyone else, who had similar stories and wanting to better themselves for similar reasons.

2020-01-02 19:20:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej70us/day_18/,Day 18?,"Let me start by saying I lost track of the time which is such a good sign for me. In 2018 I tried weed for the first time when my brother offered me a puff of his joint and I fell in love with the feeling it gave me immediately. I was so convinced that weed wasn’t something that you become dependent on or harm you in any way shape or form, and that was due to both of my brothers who have been smoking for a long time. They explained that you can quit it as easy as deciding not to eat a piece of chocolate, and I grasped into that idea. 

I started smoking once a day at nighttime to relieve the stress of the day and enjoy my time, it was fun and exciting in the beginning and stayed that way for a while. However, after a while, I started to realize that it was becoming harder from me not to smoke once a day or go a week or two without smoking, I was thinking about it constantly. I was very nervous the first time I used my brothers ID to buy weed(since we look like each other) not because I was afraid of being caught but it was the first time I went out of my way to buy weed. Previously my source of weed as joining my brothers while they were smoking or them giving me a joint each day. I used to only smoke once a day but when I bought weed on my own, I smoked for three days straight from beginning to end and that made me so scared because I felt like I was losing myself in a sense. So I gave the weed I bought to my friend and I said that I would only smoke once a day again. But for obvious reasons like many people here, I started smoking more until August of 2019 when I went back home and decided that I wanted to leave it.

When I was home, I tried to convince myself that I didn't want it and that it was disgusting and that it was changing everything that I was. The only thing in life that I didn’t want to lose hold of is my mentality and clear mindset, and when I was smoking weed, I was losing that. When I came back home, there was this album that I loved so much that I decided to smoke a couple of times and give it a listen because one of my favorite things to do was listening to music high. Those couple of times turned into almost 4 months of consistent smoking, day and night. In those moments I truly felt disgusted by everything I was doing, and who I was becoming. There were moments where I would wake up like many people who felt the same way here and would have this motivation to quit today. However, when nighttime came, I would find myself just casually rolling a joint or two and smoking my nights away. I started to get very scared when I heard my breathing become different and I would hear a wheezy sound. 

Reading about how addiction forms and seeing how both my brothers we so dependent on it and how many times they failed to quit it was a major signal that I needed to work on it and not give up. I was reading the book ”The Power of Habit” which I think everyone who decides to quit anything they are struggling with, should read. And it explained many parts I needed to know, I started watching videos of people who successfully quit weed, and TED Talks related to quitting a certain habit because that is what addiction is essentially is, a habit that has formed and became a routine. I wrote a long-ass list with every reason that I could relate to why I wanted to personally quit weed and how it was affecting the course of my life and accomplishments. This list is hung up on my wall with a title that reads: I DO NOT WANT TO SMOKE WEED. I believe it is important for you to remind your brain what you want and don’t and that helped me so much, I would read it at the beginning of that day and at the end of the night.

Just days into not smoking and still having weed in my room to this day, by giving myself the option to smoke if I truly felt like, I felt my urges fading very quickly. I know what I want and when what you want outweighs the struggles you will learn how to get over past them. I know now that even when it crosses my mind, they are just thoughts and not actions, I know now that I have the choice and I can roll another joint but I truly don’t want to, I know it will mess me up for at least couple of weeks. And I am regaining my old view of life that I adored the way it is. I even from time to time go into my brother's room and smell the weed and touch the papers, just to show myself that I can have huge bags of weed and what once stimulated my cravings and decide not to do it by choice. 

I know that it can be harder for others because everyone experiences things differently, especially, when you have been smoking for a longer time. I am here to tell you that you can do it! You need to remind yourself every day why you want to stop smoking, what the benefits and negatives are. Start trying new things, learn how to play the guitar or take drawing classes or do something that you are interested in. THE BRIGHT SIDE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN SMOKING YOUR LIFE AWAY, we do not have much time to waste and we shouldn’t destroy our brains and bodies with unnecessary things. You can do it! You just have to believe that change is real, like all the ones who were dependent on stronger things and still managed to quit it, you can be that! Time will make it easier I promise!",7

But I also know if I hit up my supplier, my brain will release dopamine and I'll feel better. It wants so badly to reward me for shitty actions. The main issue is the boredom I have outside of smoking. I have literally zero friends. None. It's strange to me, in an age of digital freedom and communication (social media) almost everyone has some sort of friendship, whether digital or physical. Too introverted I guess, hell I don't feel comfortable writing this, putting this out for others to see. This is certainly my fault I'm sure, I don't put myself out there enough, or don't socialize enough. I work from home, there have been many days I have not spoken an audible word to anyone else. 

But I feel hopeless, and have for a long time. I started smoking 2 years ago, and it went from occasionally, to nightly, to almost all day when I can.  At this point I've become suicidal. Between the misery life threw at me and the fires I started myself, I have little hope of ever being happy or meaningful. I don't see any point in continuing to live and struggle with this. 

Life seems to be all about perspective. How we individually view things: ourselves, others, life in general. I always get happy when reading others success stories, I however do not think I will ever write one of those. A losing mindset, sure, but maybe it's the truth. We see winners and losers every day in life. I am starting to think I am the latter, just had the fortune of growing up and staying in the middle class. I feel like a burden to my family and the world around me. That is the perspective I see.

I've had very small breaks that involve me going on vacations without weed, and I've been totally fine minus even more trouble sleeping than normal. I'm undergoing a voluntary medical procedure (liver donation) which requires that I be sober. I knew it was something I might have to do last New Year's so I did a dry (from booze) January and have only drank sporadically and minimally since then (minus St. Patrick's Day and a vacation). I was supposed to quit smoking weed a month or so ago but did not, and now my time has run out and I have to do it. I'm currently 36 hours sober. I'm also booze sober but that's not really difficult.  


My biggest issues are that my husband is a smoker (he's somewhat supportive of me, but will never quit nor would I want him to at my insistence), we grow so it's free and always in my house, I don't really know what to do with myself at night (trying to read because I love reading and never could when high), and I miss the actual act of smoking a joint. This is probably the hardest part. I have never smoked a cigarette, but the ritual of smoking a joint after work and throughout the night into the wee hours has become super therapeutic for me and I have always been a bit of a goody two shoes so it made me feel kind of illicit and fun.  I am not too keen on vaping because of the possible chemicals, but maybe there's a good one out there that someone has researched and is safe. Feel free to sound off on that.  


Getting personal. From puberty I've had depression and a litany of other mental health stuff. Nothing too wild, but tons of general depression, anxiety, self-harm, etc. Three years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD which kind of explained a lot although it took years for me to fully understand how interwoven all of my mental health issues and the substance use are. Booze/drug use is a common thing for people with undiagnosed ADHD because they can't understand what's wrong with them so they try to numb themselves for various reasons. I did a whole lot of that. A ton of binge drinking to the point of alienating people in college and my early twenties and then from my late twenties on, just smoking myself into a stupor at night. I've spent the last several years in therapy, seeing a psychiatrist, and doing a lot of self-work to the best of my ability. Focus is hard, but I'm giving it my best. Anyways, I'm fairly certain that I'm just using weed as what I consider a healthier way of numbing myself than booze and have been for a while. Having depression, anxiety, and ADHD (and all the other stuff that gets mixed in with those - one kind of causes the other or exacerbates it and then it spirals into more severe versions of those), make me want to be numb so I can avoid doing THE WORK to fix these things. It's also hard to address my issues linearly. I.E. I'm depressed let's do this, this, and this to fix it. But wait, now I'm feeling less depressed but I'm feeling crushing anxiety about everything else and can't sleep because of it. Do the things to fix the anxiety like spending 4 hours a day walking/running, OK but you forgot to focus at work and now you've missed this, this and this. Cycle repeats. It's just all really overwhelming but I finally feel like I'm in a place where this might be it. I might just need to be a sober person as boring as that sounds to me. I definitely need to be one for the next six months so here goes nothing. If you made it this far, thanks for reading my ramblings.",5

I get that smoking makes me lazy. It makes me very lazy. It helps me justify sitting on my ass eating crap food getting nothing done. I know it's detrimental to my health and my lifestyle.

When I'd smoke, I'd chill out on the couch and watch TV, surf the web, play video games and smoke more. Now I'm trying to figure out what to do with myself now that I don't smoke. I am well aware of how weed enabled me to just be a lazy fuck all day.

I used to smoke daily and I wasted money I needed for other shit on it. I guess what I'm really trying to say is, I'm starting to quit and hope I'm in the right place for some support and tips.

What are the effects of quitting? What did you notice in the short/long term? Do you feel better? How has it impacted your life and relationships? Affecting your goals, your ambitions and motivations?

I've taken tolerance breaks before and I noticed the first few days are the hardest. Those are the times I'll find ways to get some smoke, a little extra cash or way to score some pot. I get bored and start finding things to clean around my house or other productive-esque things I can do to fill time.

TL;DR just starting my quitting adventure, give me tips and advice and stories. Help me not feel so alone in it and make this feel easier for me",4
2020-01-02 17:14:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej59pq/so_i_quit_smoking_weed_on_accident_and_i_feel/,"So I quit smoking weed on accident and I feel great. Been a lurker on this sub with no real intention to stop smoking. Was just nice to relate on some issues and enjoyed the camaraderie. But I would like to share my story, sorry it's a little long...","Like I said I've been a lurker here and I've enjoyed many of your posts and saved a few of them and some comments I found very relatable and helpful. This is my first post or comment. 

I know part of me really just wants to keep smoking and act like it's not a problem. While it may not be the root of all my problems it doesn't help me like it use to. It use to only positively effect me, I was still happy and social even when I was high. It always made my body and mind feel good. It always felt right. That's definitely not the case anymore. Maybe it is the root of my problems. I know it's something I need to consider. 

I have been smoking since highschool and haven't ever stopped, it's been over ten years. That's crazy to think about how much time I've kept the habit up. Also since highschool I've smoked cigarettes, drank beer and liquor, have enjoyed a little share of hallucinogens and some rec drugs and have been able to let go of all of them at some point in my life. I smoked cigarettes since highschool, stopped cold turkey for one and half years and now enjoy one every now and then. I still enjoy a drink every now and then and admit I can go a little heavy when I do but it's not a craving or habitual, I can just drop it unlike weed which I've literally never let go of since I started and if I didn't have it everything sucked and I probably wouldn't feel like doing anything until I found some weed.

Anyway...

My dealer took a week off for the holidays and I didn't get enough to last me until he was open again. Smoked the last I had about a week ago and I was plotting to get some as soon as he was back. He's been back for a few days but I haven't gone to him. I feel great and actually beginning to feel a little proud of myself. I also have an insane amount of energy that's almost annoying haha but it's probably because I don't have anything to put my energy into.

I do want to be honest with everyone here and out of respect for people who actually have quit, I feel like I should admit that I have dry hit my pipe a few times and smoked resin. I don't want to lie and I hope it's alright that I still post this. I can't say enough how much I respect this sub and the people here. You all seem like very understanding and loving people. I'm sorry if what I'm posting isn't what this sub is meant for but I feel like this is the place I could come to and share my experience, and I just want to be one hundred percent honest and transparent. I'm sorry if I am in the wrong and I understand.
Even though I haven't technically stopped, I feel great. Work is better, I feel full of life again and I can express myself with much more ease. I think that's the best part. My wit and humour is strong again! It's great. I absolutely love making people laugh, it's a great natural high, it definitely hits that reward/pleasure spot in my head and it feels great haha

I do suffered from over anxiety and have a had a couple severe panic attacks to the point I thought I was having a seizure. I hope this change will help, it would be nice to be able to go into new social situations or be on an airplane and not worry I'm going shit and vomit all over myself from being anxious haha

Another reason I'm really excited about this change is because the relationship I'm in right now is struggling. I live with my girlfriend which we've done before and ended up going different ways. She also smokes but I feel like she smokes more because I'm around, she's not the best at finding it or amounts and prices. She wouldn't even really try to get any and I know she would honestly love it if I stopped smoking. There's a good chance we go our separate ways again at the end of our lease but I want to do this for the both of us. I know at the end of the day it should be about me and improvment for myself but if we do separate I want to leave each other better than when we got together again. 

I want to be that force of positive action for her. She's had a tough life and she's worked hard to improve it little by little with what she had, which was nothing. She's tired of being disappointed and I know I've contributed to that feeling. She feels like a failure and I want to be able to change that idea that we have failed. I want to be a partner who's ready to live a full life and really share some experiences with each other and not just float/coast through life which is all I've been doing. I want to be a source of positivity, of motivation and I want to inspire her and everyone I come across be their best, to care, to try, to better yourself even in the smallest ways. Push yourself to be that great person you already are. There's nothing you need to add to become a better person, you just need to pull it from within yourself, and become the master of your own seas. I would appreciate any support you have on my journey to mastering the sometimes rough seas and let's help each other to calmer waters.

Thank You for reading

I Appreciate and Love all of You

Edit: Wow. Thank all of you so so much. I'm honestly in tears right now because I have all of you at my back just like that. You are all so amazing. I'll admit for some reason I'm scared to fully commiting to quiting and I think it's because part of me doesn't think I actually can. But what I do know because of all of you is that I am on the right track. Failing is not what I want to do but it happens and we get back up and fight another day. I've always been a fighter but I was honestly at my limit. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for giving me hope and strength again. I will remain a regular here and pass forward the love and support I have gotten from all of you.

 I have a friend who says water is life, life is love and gratitude. So life is two parts gratitude and one part love. H2O. Some hippy shit but thank you, thank you, I love you all.

One last thing, I just commented on another post here about anxiety and I would like to share. It's not really a fight, it shouldn't be a battle. Give your problems space to be. The more space you give them the more clear they become to be. The clearer they are the more you understand yourself and you can tame and even 'conquer' it. But it's not a battle, the more I fought the less I had control over myself. You can't out think your problems. It takes strong will, surrendering to the things you have no power over and action over the ones you do. I've honestly always loved the serenity prayer which is similar even though I'm not religious because it captures that perfectly.

Thanks again everyone, I feel like I'll sleep pretty good tonight even without a smoke. I hope the same for everyone else. 

See you around friends! Peace and love ☺️",309
2020-01-02 17:00:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej52ex/introduction_4_weeks_on_the_bandwagon/,"Introduction, 4 weeks on the bandwagon","Hi everyone! I just wanted to introduce myself here.  I quit smoking/vaping weed 5 weeks ago. I have been smoking regularly since my teens. I'm almost 39. I have never really seen weed as causing an issue, and I have enjoyed it very much. I have attempted to quit a few times in my life, mostly because I felt guilty about lying/hiding it from my kids. Then I got to the point where I 'owned' it and no longer hid my habit (however, it was still a little awkward and I still kind of tried to hide it though I wasn't fooling anyone lol). 

Anyway, this year I have been on a major health kick, quitting sugar, meditating and doing yoga regularly, intermittent fasting and also longer fasting. I am on what is called the 'pranic journey' which is just a personal journey to fully realized health and human potential.  This requires kicking all reliance on outside physical stimuli and even reliance on food as sustenance, although the process can be as slow as you want/need it to be. 

I thought I would hold on to weed even before I gave up most foods, but I realized that actually my addiction to weed is my strongest addiction and the one I need to give up now. 

The first month was actually super easy! I ran out of weed and didn't buy anymore. I didn't really miss it and rarely thought about it. However, since the past week I have been craving it pretty bad. I feel bored, uninspired. I am eating more trying to replace the missing hole I think it has caused. Eating more is definitely not my goal lol! Hence, I am now going to spend some time on this reddit, reading everyone's stories and getting support to stay the course. 

Thank for reading! I have officially filled up some 'I really want to smoke weed' time :) and feeling better already!",11
2020-01-02 16:58:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej51ih/should_i_quit/,Should I quit?,"I'm confused. But also, I think I know the answer. I just need some people to say, yes you should. 
My story: 
I started smoking in college at 18 y/o in 2014. Smoked daily, so much (14 joints +) and they were ALWAYS spliffs. Tobacco and marijuana all day, everyday for two years. I dropped out of college and continued smoking, with my boyfriend, but smoked LESS, way less. Smoking dropped off over the years and in the last year have only been smoking before bed to help w insomnia (and also my attachment to the spliff). Doesnt matter where in the world I was, I will DEFINITELY be having my bedtime spliff. My boyfriend quit smoking nightly about a year ago, and will only smoke w my if it's a special occasion. Recently I became a guardian of two teenage girls (I'm only 24!) and we live in the same house. To smoke my nightly spliff, I have to climb out of a window so they won't see me go outside to smoke... Sometimes when no one is home I'll smoke during the day for a little fun.
My perspective:
Smoking is something i do enjoy, i do look forward to. But more than that, i wish i knew what my life would be like without it. Also I want to quit tobacco, i really don't like it and won't even smoke a cigarette by itself. I ONLY smoke spliffs tho, no bowls, no nothing. I think part of the reason why I enjoy it so much is the thrill of doing something illegal (I live in the south), for having something that's just special me time, and also because it makes me feel silly and fun. The hard part is, I know I cant just quit. I've only been able to quit for days at a time before crawling back (I'll always convince myself that it isnt a big deal). But it is! I believe it keeps me from doing other activities I would really enjoy, keeps me from staying out with friends bc i wouldn't be able to smoke, makes me groggy so i dont want to go exercise ETC ETC. 

Anyway I just want someone to shake me and say ""BABY you can do it! You need to do it!"" My boyfriend is so loving and kind, I know he wants me to quit but he would never tell me/force me to anything. I need some kind of support outside of myself.

Thanks in advance to all of you wonderful, beautiful people!",2
2020-01-02 16:56:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej50mv/really_struggling_with_purpose/,Really struggling with purpose,"I've noticed every time I attempt to stop smoking weed it comes to full realization that my life is extremely bland. Don't get me wrong, I already knew that when I was smoking, but I guess the feeling of despair I have now was temporarily subsided by smoking weed. I think this has been the hardest part for me whenever I quit.

For the past 5 years my routine has been work, smoke, game; while holding down jobs has been an issue because I'm terrified of having to interact with people. The last job I was at was such mental torment that I can't even explain. It's worth mentioning that before I got into smoking, I was always kind of an isolated person even in childhood, I had a small group of friends at school but very rarely went out with them and I haven't hung out with any friends since high school, I'm now 23.

What I'm thinking is all of these years of isolation, along with using weed for past several years has fucked up my ability to make meaningful relationships and go out and do normal everyday things. I've always tried to stay optimistic, and I still do sometimes, but I feel like the optimism is fading away. Sometimes, I feel like I've already fucked up my brain enough with the isolation and weed use that this is just who I am, therefore I just keep smoking. I HATE that type of negative thinking, but it's so damn hard when you don't see any bright light at all for the future. 

I want to try to get my mind off stuff but I don't even know where to start. I think gaming for the most part is a huge no no for me because I would get high and then game, so that association makes me want to smoke when I'm gaming. The Leafs game is on tonight so there's that... though being baked while watching hockey was amazing. FUCK

I just hope someone can maybe relate and share their story, I'd love to hear if anyone here goes through a similar situation. I big time appreciate anyone who read this all and wish you luck on your journey, we need to do this.",3
2020-01-02 16:51:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej4xuo/three_days_in_and_i_am_feeling_withdrawal/,Three days in and I am feeling withdrawal symptoms (I think),"Ah, I usually lurk reddit but I always find myself observing r/leaves threads very often.   


Daily smoker for at least 6 years. I have always relied on substances to help calm my brain down (not to turn off the thoughts but rather to stop how many I have and how hard it is to focus sometimes - I feel successful and motivated even as a daily smoker, so I never felt an urge to stop). At 31 I had my first child. I love him and I love being a parent. Smoking has never interfered with my desire to be a good Dad or the motivation to engage my boy.   


 I am feeling different about Pot though these days (just as I am with everything). It certainly feels like pot helps but I know the feeling is fleeting and requires more for that continued feeling. I don't hate pot but I am in a battle with my brain right now to control the urge to want to use more. It's very easy where I live to use and no one bats an eye if I do, so really the pressure for me to stop is coming from me only.   


I am three days in and I have felt headaches for the past two days. Today the headaches were moderate, enough to notice and keep me in bed for a few more hours than normal. I feel sick and generally I feel not 100%.  


So for anyone reading this my question is how long did you feel withdrawal affects? I am exercising, eating mostly healthy and drinking water. I know everyone is different, but perhaps reading personal accounts of other people who have experienced (or currently are) withdrawal from Marijuana would greatly help. I am trying to stay busy and not think about smoking, but the headaches and these other symptoms are really the challenge right now.",1
2020-01-02 16:20:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej4i4y/21_days_without/,21 days without.,"So right after my 26th birthday (3 weeks ago) I decided to stop smoking as it was getting too much. I’ve been smoking since 15 and everyday since 17 in which I’ve only maybe taken a total of 4 weeks off in 8 and a half years. By the end I was smoking a gram of high grade shatter and had been doing that for months. 

The last year has been beyond stressful for me. From getting laid off when I wasn’t expecting it to then injuring myself at work and going through the trials of battling workers compensation for surgery, loosing, going back to work and then re-injuring myself worse then before (still battling them and getting surgery in a few weeks). In that time I was smoking an ounce every 4 days then progressed to a gram of shatter a day. I also have been dealing with a relationship ending on top of all of that and it got too much. 

It got worse when I started being hospitalized from my hangovers a year ago as I can’t stop puking when I’m hungover, so naturally I said “fuck it, I’ll just smoke more”. Always been a partier and I like to have a good time. But by the start of December I’d had enough. I was using it as a crutch and with everything going on I was beginning to become severely depressed. I have realized that’s what I have been doing for over 8 years. Never happy with myself or my lifestyle, I have now decided to smarten the fuck up and attempt to get my shit together. 

I thought by this point I’d be feeling more energized and though I do feel better I feel like I have no energy to do more and I’m constantly tired. Mind you I have no money right now and I’m mentally preparing for a surgery that will be a 6-9 month recovery (ACL) so I’m not sure what is stress induced and what’s the withdrawal. I never thought I’d get this far and honestly don’t miss it much. The sense of accomplishment I feel for going this far only makes me want to continue to be sober (in all ways). Don’t really know why I’m posting here but everyone in my life smokes or drinks and I feel like no one gets how hard this all is.

I quit cold turkey and know that I was intaking at least 800mg a day. The first few weeks weren’t that bad as it was nice to feel aware and not up in the clouds but the last 5 days or so I’ve been extremely tired, headaches, crazy dreams and super irritable. Just wondering if anyone on here has a similar experience to mine and how long these symptoms lasted for them ? I have no set date, don’t know if I’m done for good, a year or only a few months, but as of right now I don’t miss it. I want to go back to school and achieve these high expectations I have set for myself and if I return to my old habits that won’t happen. This experience has been eye opening to me to show myself what I am capable of when I put my mind too something. 

To anyone trying to quit, you’ll only be able too once you truly want to quit. Up until this point in my life I had 0 desire to ever quit weed as I thought it was helping me, but I’ve begun to realize that it wasn’t. It was just making me content with where I was.",3

2020-01-02 15:43:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej3yo0/2_years_my_experiences/,2 years - my experiences,"Two years ago, New Years Day 2018, I decided to take all of my paraphernalia (bongs, grinders, papers, lighters, tins, etc), put them all in my old school bag and put it in the bin.

Since then, I've been clean (without any *cheat days* or relapses) and with the start of 2020 it's been two years since I last had a smoke, going from smoking every single day for a number of years.

I decided it was time to quit as I was taking on considerably more responsibility at work and determined that giving weed the slip would be a good way to ensure I had the focus and drive to fulfil those responsibilities (spoiler alert: it was).  Coupled with this was the realisation that I was increasingly isolating myself from friends and family in favour of sitting at home and getting high.

Some of you may be here because you're considering quitting with the turn of the new decade, or maybe you're even in your second day and you're here to read success stories and keep motivated.  All I can say to you is keep at it as it's the best lifestyle choice you can make.  People will notice an amazing upswing in your demeanour, regardless of whether or not they're aware you're quitting or have any experience with stoners.  I remember people commenting on how much more healthy I looked and I found myself so much more organised and able to focus.

That isn't to say that it'll be easy.  What I found most difficult was leaving behind friends who I'd had lots of great times with over the years.  Weed is a funny thing, because it brings together people from all walks of life who have nothing in common besides smoking weed.  That's what I realised with my former group of friends - we were only friends because we smoked together and what kept us hanging out was a mutual desire to get high.

Take out that element and you realise that they're actually losers without ambitions and that by keeping them in your life, you'll end up dragged down with the rest of them.  That may sound a bit harsh, but case and point:

* Friend A decided to take research chemical hallucinogens and spent the last year in a mental institution.
* Friend B quit a course in Computer Science (with genuine talent for the discipline) to work full-time at McDonald's.
* Friend C was sacked from a promising apprenticeship with Audi as he frequently took an *extended lunch breaks* in order to get high and endangered a customer's life after their wheels came off following maintenance he performed while high.
* Friend D spends his days smoking weed, eating outrageous amounts of food and getting high.  At age 23, he's yet to get his first job and pays for his habit with an allowance from his parents, supplemented by pawning their forgotten possessions.
* Friend E quit about a year before me.  He's now engaged to be married and is training to join the Royal Marines, outside of a steady job he's held for the last two years.

Perhaps you're on the fence about quitting because you're worried about leaving behind people who you connected with through weed.  But just look at those examples I gave and think where they're going to be in two years' time and decide if you want to join them.

For me, the first two weeks were the worst.  I found it difficult to sleep and when I did, I found the sudden sensation of dreaming alarming (especially given the bizarre nature of their content) and worried that I'd wrecked my head.  I sat through the *brain fog* and wondered what the point of quitting was if my thoughts were going to be more confused than when I was smoking.  But soon you realise that it's been two weeks since your last smoke, and you feel pride.  Then a month goes by.  Then you're at the two month mark and you don't even think about having a smoke anymore.

Ultimately though, the only person who can take the plunge is you.  As difficult as it is, nobody can shoulder this burden on your behalf and you need to decide if you want to do this for the betterment of yourself.

Best of luck and hope this was of some help to someone out there.",6

2020-01-02 15:13:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej3ihy/pain_is_good_pain_is_growth/,Pain is good. Pain is growth.,"Day 53 checking in. I've come to realise that in order to achieve true happiness, your body needs to know that it's on the right track to reaching the best version of itself. This means that pain and suffering are necessary and actually a good thing because it means growth. Pain is medicine. If you use weed or anything that enables an unnatural increase of dopamine in your system, you're creating a barrier for your nervous system to adapt and modify itself to real world events. If it's unable to upgrade itself then your body will keep going around in circles. The irony is that we think we're connecting more with the source by using cannabis when in fact we're drifting apart and disconnecting even further.

I think this tale is as old as time itself and is a repeating pattern in every hero story. The child is growing when tragedy suddenly happens, the child's system isn't developed enough to deal with the immense amount of pain and suffering. Numbing and disconnection happens, probably necessary for the scar to heal enough for the child to grow without dying. When the child becomes an adult he knows he has to deal with the old scar without any help and face the antagonist (pain) head on and alone. Know that when you feel that you're finally ready to quit numbing yourself and face reality, the pain and suffering you will have to inevitably face is actually a good thing and is as necessary as the air you breath. Because true glory and peace awaits you at the end of the tunnel, the hero's journey always has a happy ending. It's time to reclaim your kingdom! I believe in you completely.",15

I’m uncomfortable in every sense of the word... but excited nonetheless. Even after the subsequent anxiety attacks I’ve had every few hours because it really “hits” me that it’s over (I’m refusing to go purchase another bowl). This is it. I just hope I can do it.

Time for change.,"I am a wife, mother, teacher & lover of weed. I started in high school and by junior year I was smoking daily- I’m 31.. over a decade of weed. I’ve had times of not smoking daily.. but I was either pregnant or heavily drinking (gotta love college). I struggled with anger growing up, but weed calmed me down. I had 9 surgeries past decade and weed helped me avoid a serious dependency on painkillers, which I am forever grateful for. Tbh, I don’t have anything against weed, my love for it is just as real as it was at 16. In my case, weed isn’t the problem, it’s me. 2019 was rough, and I realized I was numbing my life away. It brought up issues that I numbed away years ago. I found myself hitting a pen, while on edibles and still needing more to numb. I need to be better. My goal is to spend 2020 sober. So here I am, day two, chugging water to get rid of this pounding headache, constantly fighting heat flashes, reading all of your posts. Thanks for the inspiration. Cheers to 2020.",121

Ive decided that it was Time for me to stop. Ive only been smoking since september but i realised that it was changing Who i was. I started because i had the most emotionally rough summer of my life. I was feeling like shit everyday and wanted something to make it go all away. I started when i got back in University for my second year. Since Weed is legal over here, its so easy to get some. I dont know if its because of the Weed, but i noticed that i had a lot of memory loss since i started. Im just 19 and i dont want to fuck Up the test of my life just because i wanted to smoke and change my mind. I was Afraid it would be hard for the first Days but lucky me, its my second Day without smoking and since i dont have Weed on me, i dont feel the urge to smoke, but it scares me because i'm Afraid later in life i relapse and dont have the same luck. Last Time i took a Puff was at midnight for the New year. I dont know if Ill be able to completely stop since i have to go back in University and Weed helped me sleep and remove stress. But i dont want to fall back to Weed. Anyway, like i said im only on Day 2 but im willing to changer for the better and maybe even stop smoking for good! Thanks to whoever Read this.

I was doubting if I should post anything because I don't think my story is particularly interesting, but maybe it will inspire someone. Warning, it's kind of a ramble. 

I (F, 23) tried weed for the first time at age 19. The first time I didn't even particularly like it and didn't try again for another few months or so. At some point after the second time I started smoking regularly with housemates. 4 of us, myself included, had just gone through a breakup and this was our way of bonding and dealing with our feelings. Once a week quickly turned into every day and every day turned into all day, every day.

Despite realising it was getting out of hand, I continued using. In 2018 I successfully quit for around 3 months but got overly confident, thought I could go back to ""once in a while"" and fully relapsed.

About 7 months ago I wanted to get tested for ADD, but was told I had to deal with my addiction first. I was bummed, because in the meantime I had to figure shit out myself and couldn't get any help (I struggle with anxiety and an emotionally abusive childhood). I got put on the wait lists for both ADD testing and help with my addiction. As both wait lists were quite long I was told I should try to quit on my own if I could, which I tried on and off but it didn't stick.

A little over a month ago I got a call that the wait list for my addiction treatment was over. I started seeing a therapist weekly and she's been helping me massively! She never told me I had to quit, I did so myself after a few sessions because I wanted to have something to tell her. As a bonus, as long as I am clean we have time in our weekly sessions to talk about other things, like my childhood. I am now 1 month clean! It hasn't been easy, but I am slowly starting to feel better and more confident. 

This post is getting long so I'll end it here. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. Keep strong, we can do it! I will not smoke with you today.

EDIT for additional info:

Right before the new year, on the 30th, I got a call that I can get an intake for ADD testing. I have an appointment set on the 29th this month. Timing is great as I'd need at least 6 weeks sober before I could get tested, and by that time I will be at 8. It's a little extra motivation to keep going.",4

I'm now at 8.5 days, the longest I ever went before this was 9 days but I'm doing so much better this time around. I'm using the Quit Weed app and I don't know if it's seeing the numbers go up or the shame of having to start over (like actively adjusting the app) if I cave, but I've had a much stronger resolve this time around. I'm still struggling at times, but overall I'm having a much better experience. I'm really excited about what the future holds for me if I can get past this, I know the weed has been holding me back.

My anxiety is definitely up and I'm having a hard time sleeping, but I'm hoping those will both lessen in time. Advice on either of those, especially the sleeping, would be greatly appreciated.

At first it was to bring me closer to music. The first times listening to my favorite music high af, was an out of body experience at 19. Fast forward 21 years to me now, it's changed so much. I did use THC as a crutch to deal with my PTSD as a kid, had a couple traumatic events that happened that I never seeked counseling for until I was an adult. In the end, this is an excuse I see now. I've grown up a lot still the last couple years, but as an addict you can only go so far. 

I have smoked so much $ into the air from leaves, that I can't even think about it without feeling like a fucking chump. Well I finally decided that 2020 would be my first step towards life without weed, and seeing who the f, I really am down there. Finding this group has been very helpful, and I feel much of the pain you all do. After 20 years of smoking I'm lucky... I have my hot wife, dream house, work for myself at home, drive the dream car, etc, and from the outside until we actually talk, you'd think I'm a successful guy. Never judge a book by it's cover. 

Inside I feel I've been falling apart for years. Working from home makes the boredom and temptation worse, but I'd never trade my job to work in a office again 9-5. My most successful year 10 years ago, worked from home,  I still smoked every day, but only during the hours of 10pm-midnight. I lost that type of discipline years ago. So my goal in 2020 is to let go of the THC. 

Every time I have tried quitting in the past, it's awful. Sweaty hands, hard to sleep, not anger but rage over nothing, anti everything, depression, negative spiraling thoughts, and no appetite sometimes to the point of being dizzy. So after reading many of your posts on here, I came up with a list of reasons not to smoke, that I'd thought to share. When I'm tempted this year, I'm going to refer to this post. So here it goes, and I hope this helps some of you.

Thanks also if you read this far. Cheers to a healthy 2020.  

My Reasons Not to Smoke> 
Tired all day, sleeping way too much-naps, no motivation for work or hobbies, socially awkward in basic daily interactions, lazy at work means less money, easily distracted and irritated, huge mood swings, uncontrollable anger bursts, asthma, coughing up shit, wheezing, shortness of breath, hard to take a deep breath sometimes, lower libido, falling short of music and work goals consistently, distant, unattached to anything, complacent, forgetting your words mid sentence, forgetting everything else, harder to learn new things, less affection for loved ones, years seem to pass, nothing changes, I feel I'm boring to hang with because I'm high.. lack of conversation etc, don't read as much, eat like shit, gained weight to the point of being obese 6'0 255 lbs & (used to be thin), bloated feeling after a munchie session, hate myself after smoking or munchies, don't attempt personal growth as much, wasteful spending.",62

But I got through it and I'm here at the beginning of a new day that doesn't include work to keep me distracted. My plan is to try to keep busy, I'm gonna take all the Christmas stuff down and get my house into general non-holidays working order. But I have integrated weed so deeply into my life that the prospect of taking down my tree and cleaning my house makes me want to smoke-like I need something to look forward to and that's been it. I've been using it to jazz up the mundane so long that every domestic action triggers an urge.

It was about time to start fighting the real causes of addiction ...,"Reached 9 months stopping cannabis and nicotine, cold turkey, after 30 years of addiction, at my early fifties.  (You may read the 3 and 6-months reports, with the cravings of the first weeks and the struggles of the first months, at my profile).

Getting past the 6-months milestone I had no severe cravings any more but I was still struggling with anxiety and depression, despite exercise, meditation and psychotherapy. I realized that weed and nicotine absence were just letting the underlying issues appear, again.

(I was, several years ago, diagnosed with anxiety-driven, mild depression (dysthymia), which I had profoundly been “medicating” with weed. For years.  Cutting the “medication”, which had turned into a cause of more anxiety over the years, made the whole system unstable again, profoundly because of dopamine depletion.)

So, after the six month of abstinence :

- I stopped coffee, as another addicting substance, causing anxiety and cigarette cravings, too.  That was not an extremely  difficult fight. Two weeks of severe cravings were followed by a “click” down on morning anxiety. Sleep became better, too.  After a month, I allowed decaf coffee and some tea. In total, I am getting about 90% less caffeine than before.

- I searched for, found and visited a psychiatrist specializing in dysthymia (functioning depression). He immediately diagnosed persisting mild depression and proposed the necessary treatment.

Now, it is the first time in the last ... 30 years that I feel in the right track.  Not high, but balanced.

The only “problem” is that I had to also cut down on alcohol, as it started making me more depressed than usual. So I did, stopping the hard liquor first (my dear malts, my precious bourbons) and then wine (ah my cabernets, my merlots) and beers. Alcohol-free beer is now my companion, when I want to drink more than 100 ml of wine, or 300 ml of beer, per week.

I continue therapy, meditation and exercise, although I have to admit that my recent “happiness through balanced mind” made me a little lazy. For the first time, not regretting it. But I am coming back, with vengeance - especially on meditation and exercise.

My creativity and productivity are also getting better. Most importantly, the “anxiety -procrastination - guilt” cycle is broken, for good.
My mornings are again, most of the time, as happy as they should.

For the first time in recent years, I am again optimistic for my mental situation, I am looking forward with hope, not despair.

Lessons learned after these 9 months:

- Stopping weed and tobacco is difficult, but is worth it. And it is safe - nothing can go wrong.
  
- As Alan Carr wrote, stopping one addiction will lead to stopping more. Caffeine and alcohol in my case. 

- If the causes that lead to addiction cannot be tackled with reading, therapy, CBT, exercise, yoga/qiqong, meditation, nutrition, then you have to continue trying.  I think no possible treatment should be “out of the question” in our times, if selected with caution.

I will be again sharing my experiences in 3 months from now / my first weed-free year.

Hope I helped some of you - any suggestion is welcome.",6

- your problem doesn’t end after that hit 

- it’s not worth the instantaneous regret you might get after going back (I did) 

- it feels SOUL CRUSHING when you give in to temptation

Long story short: This is my second try, I used to dab and smoke wax infused prerolls for 3 years straight.
During these times I realized what was wrong and what needed to be done. 
With my mind in a cloudy haze all the time, I pulled myself to reality. 
Well, This time I want things to work out, anyone got suggestions on what I could do to keep my mind occupied? 
It seems like filling the void is a struggle, not smoking made me realize I had waste so much time. 
I’ve been feeling fine except the, groggines, moodiness, and loss of appetite.  

Side note: I’ve been having the urge to give in, but I’m refraining from falling back into the void.",3

I came across this page and I'm so glad I did. I have a hard time being vulnerable with others and asking for help, so it's pretty cool to find a community of people who are going through the same thing I am! 

I started smoking about 3 or 4 years ago, 2 of those years I smoked daily with a few breaks in between. However, I'm at a point in my life where I really want to stop. I'm almost finished with graduate school and I want to continue working out and becoming healthier and thc just isn't helping me reach my goals and the place in my life that I want to be! I have been feeling very depressed, unsympathetic, impatient, and an overall sense of feeling lost with no direction or motivation. It's been very difficult feeling lonely in this short journey so far, and it's been so tempting to just turn back already and smoke again. I've also developed social anxiety over the past 6 or so months, and I want to start going out and being social again. I just want my life back!!

Thank you for creating a safe space to share and gain/give support!",4

I started smoking at the age of 19, it was infrequent and only socially, but when I moved to another country I was smoking a lot more that I was several joints daily. I was convinced that I was using it to as a stress relief, and it took me so long to see that it was causing me more stress than it's reliefing.

On the new year's eve last year at the age of 32 I smoked what will become my last joint, and had a horrible panic attack, this was an eye opener that I need to care for my mental health and stop patching it with weed. The next few month were not easy, I craved the weed, and had to endure the withdrawal symptoms while having anxiety and panic attacks. I finally seen a doctor and he put me on meds.

One year sober was a great achievement, despite the fact that most of my friends and even my girlfriend smoke. I learned to say no thanks when I'm offered a joint, and people started to get used to it in very little time. I'm more motivated, I have several hobbies that I enjoy, I'm less anxious, and I'm recalling my dreams every night, which was my favorite thing about waking up in the morning.

If you decided to quit yesterday or today, I wish you the best, and I really hope you succeed.

I smoked from dawn to dusk from 15 to 23. Last month I quit for 3 weeks, and I was feeling great. Used on Christmas Eve and immediately felt like shit, and have felt like shit since. I've committed to abstaining since then and have been completely sober, but I feel like I'm lacking in so many areas of life.

\- I don't know how to cook. I've never cooked for myself. I eat out constantly (spend \~$400 on month on fast food) I don't know what to buy, what is good for me to eat, I don't know shit about anything.

\- I'm out of shape. I don't know where to begin with getting in shape. I'm going to the gym tonight to walk/run on the treadmill for 30 minutes, but in terms of lifting, I don't know how to start. I've never actively gone to a gym before.

\- I'm lonely as fuck. But all of my social interactions before getting sober were merely transactional, or centered entirely around getting fucked up on whatever drug of choice we happened to be doing that night. I don't know how to socialize without drugs.

The list can go on and on. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I don't know what the fuck to do. Hell, I barely even know what I like doing besides playing video games, and while I'm sitting here alone in my apartment playing video games, I can't help but think to myself I'm wasting my time. I could be doing something productive, I could be getting out there. But ""how do I get out there?""

I feel like shit. I am shit. I'm angry at myself for making my entire adolescene and early adult life about drugs. I am a husk of a human being right now. I don't want to be anymore. I want to feel like I have purpose, I want to love, I want to laugh with friends, I want to feel like a human and not just some *thing* that exists on this rock, alone.

I understand this has nothing to do with my feelings on quitting marijuana. I just... Needed to vent somewhere.",18

I’ve been smoking my fair share on and off since I was 18, and am tired of subscribing to the vicious cycle. It’s lost is glamour to me and has only led me to experience stressful/depressing positions in my life.

Recently I quit once again for about the 4th/5th time (lost count). The day I quit (about 50 days ago) was probably one of the worst days I decided to quit, with a lot of compelling reasons leading up to it. I quit the night of a Guitar Performance I had after smoking consistently every day for about 3 years and I almost passed out on stage in front of 100+ people. Couldn’t play any of my parts, was so paranoid about how things were going, and was ultimately left with wondering how things ended up there in the first place. I just wanted something better for myself.

I quit because it was ruining relationships/played too big a part in my capabilities. 

-roommate whom I gave free weed to and smoked all the time with had been just completely avoiding me and just kept smoking all my stuff, totally abusing our “friendship” and my ability of bringing it to the house just to get high. Since cutting us both off he has become an alcoholic and has received a public intoxication charge, which didn’t stop his drinking.

-dad who would support my habit was getting more and more aggravated with asking for more. Stopped wanting to deal with the anxiety of that and how to get it.

-had no motivation to talk to anyone and was ultimately more introverted and shy, when I wouldn’t really consider myself as much when I was in high school and before I started smoking.

-kept denying that weed had any effect on anything that I did, but didn’t face facts until I couldn’t get high anymore, which I’m kind of surprised I’ve managed to keep the habit going so long in an illegal state

-ended up just feeling completely held back by my habit of smoking, and since making new breakthroughs in working out, being first chair guitar at school, and feeling more overall confident and strong (physically, musically, socially, mentally) I just felt like weed was going to hold me back from growing and maintaining a healthy life.

It’s been about 2 months since I quit, and don’t know how to validate how I feel. I still regularly experience withdrawal symptoms like irritation, insomnia, waking up out of bed, having energy to do things. I am completely depressed to the point where isolating myself feels so much more comfortable then trying to “perform” socially in front of others. Everyone is always worried about me because I’m seemingly incapable of expressing gratitude or happiness in front of anyone. I’m exhausted with the feeling of being caudled by everyone to make me feel better, when I know this might just be because of withdrawals(or so I think) and that there isn’t anyone else around me who is choosing to go through this as I am (smokers will just keep going back to smoking after taking breaks; roommate turning to alcohol.) it’s been almost two months and I’m still depressed and don’t know if I should be over this yet or not.

I feel like I just chew the fat when I see my therapist, because I don’t see the point in going and talking about this when I might just end up feeling better if I can wait it out...but I don’t know if this feeling is ever gonna end and at the very least just have to deal with it and be less dramatic. 

A lot of these threads seem really helpful, and I really don’t know if how I feel is because of withdrawals or not. I don’t feel depressed about anything in particular in my life, so my best explanation is this. 

It’s worrying my mom to the point where she wants me to get on antidepressants, which i don’t want to be on and have faith that it is because of withdrawals and things are gonna get better, but I’m really not sure.


TL;DR how long/what does it take to not feel so depressed and depleted. I feel so low and try to build myself up when I have no energy, just to feel knocked down when I feel incapable of living up to my own life’s standards. 

I don’t have anyone to relate to, so some insight might do me good. I don’t like to think that I have a problem, but I want to be as happy as I was before I ever started smoking/feel as good as I did high without getting high.

Thanks y’all",4

I hate being sober. I always have. As a kid, I would read about drugs. Look at videos of people taking drugs. I hadn’t even tried drugs, but I felt it’s what I was missing. And once I got my hands on my first bag of weed, I was in love. I finally felt complete. 

And that’s the problem. I wasn’t complete. But I certainly found a substance that made me feel this way. Marijuana is a false comfort. I never gave myself a chance to understand why I grew up feeling so empty; why I felt something was missing. The pot-head lifestyle consumed me. I started drinking heavily. Dabbled in various pills and psychedelics. I was dedicated to never feeling any pain or sadness. 

And now I’m stunted. In all aspects of my life, I’ve stunted any and all personal growth. I’m still not finished with school. I’ve let myself go, physically and mentally. The thing that stings the most, though, is the relationship I fucked up. I couldn’t get it together, even for her. 5 years of dating my soulmate, my best friend, and she tells me it’s my lack of control and self-discipline that will keep us apart. 

Fuck that noise. Fuck all this bullshit. My life isn’t what I want it to be, and I have to do something about it or I’ll be a sad sack of shit for the rest of my life. 

So that’s what I’m doing. I’m going sober. No liquor, no pills, and no weed. Forever. It’s this kind of struggle that will strengthen me and make me a better man. It was cool while it lasted, but I’m moving on now.

It was the best decision I ever made and I go into 2020 basically free of addiction and looking forward to change for the first time ever. 


I started smoking weed when I was 18, in college. Ever since starting I’d never gone any length of time without smoking. Never even had an official t-break until 6 years into smoking and I went two weeks. It was extremely hard and I was irritable the entire time. 

Last year, around New Year’s time 2019, I was extremely depressed and unhappy with my life. And I couldn’t pinpoint why, since I seemingly had all the makings of a happy life. Nice friends I saw regularly, a hobby in dancing and going to EDM shows and an abundance of opportunity to do so, a great apartment, decent career job with my own private office. A good family who loved me, no boyfriend but plenty of interest if I wanted one, good looks, access to beautiful nature right outside my door. Everything a younger me would’ve looked at and thought “I made it. This is a good life.” 

But I was miserable. The things in my life weren’t making me happy. I was irritable and agitated all the time, and the things that used to bring me joy like dancing or spending a cozy night in, or even fitness, all felt hollow. I felt very angry AT those things in my life for not making me happy anymore.

And I was smoking weed constantly. Every day, pretty much. Just like always. Over the previous couple years but especially 2018, I’d started noticing my reaction to weed was changing. I wasn’t feeling happy when I was high anymore, I felt depressed and anxious. I would get stuck in these thought loops of feeling like I shouldn’t be smoking and then feeling bad for smoking, and then feeling bad for feeling like I couldn’t stop. When I would smoke at shows (edm shows), it no longer helped me enjoy the music. Instead it made me feel tired and heavy in my body, and irritable at the people around me. Because my body felt heavy I couldn’t dance the way I wanted to. I’d smoke on the weekends and get absolutely nothing done. I’d go back to work Mondays miserable and groggy and sour. I’d be irritated all day until I could get home and get back on my couch and smoke weed with my shows…the same shows I’d seen a hundred times and just spent all weekend watching. 

At the end of 2018 I had a major depressive episode where I felt like I wanted to kill myself. My birthday is at the end of the year and due to that and the holidays, it’s usually a stressful time where I experience at least one major emotional breakdown. That year it was worse than normal. I literally wanted to be dead. I was in a rage of depression. It was embarrassing to happen in front of extended family, and it was frightening to me. 
I got home from spending the holidays at my folks’ and decided to stay in for new year’s eve. I needed to do some thinking and being quiet. And being sober. I remember on new year’s eve I went to the lake near my house and watched the sunset on the year. 

As I reflected on my year, I realized 2018 had been exactly the same as 2017. Same job. Same friends. Same activities. Same routines. Same health status. Same emotional issues. Same everything. 

This led me to the realization that since starting smoking ten years earlier, I’d never not stopped. I wondered where my life would be if I hadn’t smoked all those years. I wondered WHO I would be. I knew I was very unhappy and I couldn’t bear the thought of another year passing me by the same way. I needed something to change if I was to have any chance at happiness, and I knew change wouldn’t happen if I kept smoking weed everyday. 

Quitting had been on my mind for a long time and part of me had wanted to for a long time. I’d even done the “throw everything away” thing once. But I’d gone back quickly. I figured this cognitive dissonance between my desires (to quit) and my actions (not quitting) was contributing to the depression. But it was too scary to quit altogether. After all, I didn’t know who I was without weed. 

I had built my internal identity all around it. I was clinging to my years in college especially, where I’d been the cool stoner chick. With weed, my perfectionistic, judgmental, easily-triggered emotional self could be the chill one, the easy-going, fun-to-have-around, always-has-weed-but-it’s-no-big-deal girl. The girl who always found a place to belong at parties and always found a place to belong in the world due to smoking weed. 

I didn’t feel like that cool girl anymore, but I remembered being so happy when I first discovered her, and I was always trying to find my way back to that happiness. I wasn’t finding it by smoking anymore, but my internal sense of self and worth was all wrapped up in weed. So giving it up was giving up a lot more than just an activity, or a substance. It was giving up an identity, a safety net, and an entire lifestyle. 

With all of these realizations hitting me, I decided to quit weed for just one year. Just take a year and not smoke, and see how my life changes. If at the end of the year I felt like it wasn’t worth it, I could always pick it up again and have it for the rest of my life if I wanted. But I needed to see what my life could be without it. Who I could be.

Now, looking back at the year, it is certainly one of the defining years of my 20s. 
It was extremely hard in a lot of ways, and it brought more change in my life than I’ve seen in the last 6 years since graduating college – much of it internal. 


In the last year I moved back in with my folks in order to find a new job, hopefully out-of-state. I joined/fell in love with/ and found community in Toastmasters which is something I’d wanted to try for many years and never did. I let go of a lot of friendships that weren’t serving me, and am in process of finding a much more healthy relationship with myself and with the friends who are still in my life. I’ve enjoyed my family so much more and been able to be present for the birth of my two new baby nieces. I’ve gone through a lot of physical injury and been able to emotionally deal with and recover from them. I’ve made a major diet change that’s helped me find a new level of health in an autoimmune disease journey I’m on. My relationship with my folks while living with them is a thousand times better and more enjoyable since the last time I lived with them, when I was paranoid and distant for being stoned all the time. I’m still in a job I want to leave, but I’m so much happier, not irritable and emotionally unstable there.

Most interestingly, I’ve let go of several other things I’d built my identity around. I was mentally clear enough to realize they too were no longer serving me in the way they once were, and go through the very hard process of letting them go and releasing more pillars of identity I’d built for myself in the past. I feel like the real version of myself now, not a version of me that’s clinging so hard to the past that I’m not able to be present or even capable of thinking of the future. 

And not to be understated, I’ve gone through a lot of tough emotional shit. 

However, I’m grateful for that tough emotional shit. It was necessary, after 10 years of not dealing with some of it. It was intense and hard and freeing and empowering and has helped me create a new identity. I am someone who’s growing. I am a fighter. I am someone who deeply cares about authenticity and fulfilling my purpose in life. I realized this year that I don’t know what my purpose in life is, and for the first time, I actually care. I want to discover it. I’m actively seeking to discover it. That’s something I would have never cared about while smoking. 

I’ve also had to continue to work on a lot of bad habits I picked up. Just because I stopped smoking didn’t cause the related habits of binge eating junk food and binging tv on the couch all weekend to magically disappear. 

But the moral of the story is, I’ve been better able to handle all these changes because I’m mentally present. And being mentally present is actually really beautiful. Life is beautiful sober, even the ups and downs. Especially the ups and downs.  

I’ve smoked a handful of times this year. I’d say somewhere between 12 and 20. Almost all of them while I was drunk and out and someone passed me a blunt in the club. I had to learn how to drink again. I never drank much before cuz I was always high, so for a while in the beginning I didn’t know my tolerance (or that I had none), and got really drunk on accident for a few months there. 

Maybe 5 or 6 times this year did I intentionally choose to smoke, always while I was out with friends, never alone, and none of those times felt worth it. I always either regretted it, or felt like it made things worse and that I’d been having a better time before smoking. Only one time all year did I smoke and have a good time, and it was while out of town with friends, and I still feel like it would’ve been just as fun without it. I also still got really tired really early. 

So did I go an entire year without smoking at all? No. But have I ever gone an entire year smoking less than 20 times since I first started? Heck no. So that’s a major improvement. And now I’m going into 2020, still working through a lot of stuff, but so much more empowered and freer.  

I’ve had to do a lot of hard things, and let go of a lot, and get really honest this year. 
But I’m going into 2020 with a life that’s so much more open for new, good things to come in. For the first time I’m looking forward to change in 2020. 

I’m happier, more comfortable with myself, and less afraid to take on life without weed. And I truly feel I’m no longer addicted. Once in a blue moon I’ll passingly want it, but in the same thought I know I really don’t and that it won’t be worth it. 

If you want to quit, or you want your life to change but the thought of letting it go for good is too final, consider giving it just one year. You may not do it perfectly, but set an intention to see what your life could be living just one year without weed. And I hope you find as much freedom and new perspective as I did. 

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. The stories and comments on this sub have kept me going and been a huge source of support for me through all this.
Cheer’s to clear eyes and minds in 2020.",24

I also went three days without smoking,  just used the sublingual oil ... (the high I get from smoking is what I really crave so I’m trying to take baby steps and just focus on no smoking)

I picked up a trick from one of you that said not to focus on all day or a week.   So when I’m getting the urge, I ve just said to myself ‘not just yet, maybe later’ 

And it works!!  Maybe I will later, maybe I won’t ... but I’m feeling good, with energy and I feel happy.  Looking forward to a positive year!

I was watching a new story about a piece of space junk the size of a school bus hitting the earth and became so paranoid that I decided to quit smoking weed the next day. I somehow was able to quit for 9 years!!! And then I started smoking pot again in 2017. Started slow.. it was just gonna be a once in a while thing.. but it quickly became an all day daily habit. Im a pothead who once again has decided to stop smoking pot. Today is my first day.. but I’m hoping I’m successful.,60

None of roommates smoke. I have been trying to keep myself busy by playing video game or movie or reading or doing something which will keep me occupied. After 5 yrs of continues smoking last night I slept without any bud, couldnt sleep so took 5mg of Melotonin. It gave me a very good sleep yet very vivid dreams. I woke up with a mild headache which is now making its way to becoming annoying. Thank god I threw all my bowls Other wise I would have jumped right back. I feel very excited to ignite the fire in me again, yet my mind is craving for it. I have been windowshopping this sub some time now and all you guys have motivated me to become the person I know I can become. I want to start fresh as I don’t want to waste my life anymore being stuck at the same level. I’m going grow myself to the lvl I never thought I could achieve. Im tired of being scared and looked down by people around me. I know a lot of people here have heard this story with different tone each time. I apologize in advance, I just wanted to rant my mind out, as no one around me understand my mind right now. 

Long time ago I read a post here about a guy walking into the forest and comes across two paths: one thats why easy and you can see people party and smoking and having fun, and other was the rough patch of path which was dark and scary. Long story short, it was at that moment I realized how weed was affecting me without me noticing. I couldn’t find that post bow. 
If anyone can find that post and comment the link below I would appreciate it. 


I wanted to ask the people who have gone through this stage and people who are still trying to get out this phase.
What are the different things you guys did to distract or trick your mind when craving kicks in? I have quit before too but it only takes a bad day to get me right back to it again, How do you control your self to not to fall back in track when you have the craving or urges at it highest? Also does anyone have any tips for the mood swings and anxiety? 
Any advice is appreciated.",1

In terms of weed I don't crave it what so ever, maybe because I'm craving nicotine more so I don't think of weed as much. I just don't think I can drop the nicotine and it sucks.

I'm feeling a lot more clear though compared to the first couple of weeks off MJ, it truly does get better and I know soon enough I'll be over nicotine too. Wish you all luck happy new year!",2

2020-01-01 12:15:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eikpsm/nye_relapse/,NYE relapse,"Posting this to keep myself accountable. I was 20 days clean and through a lot of the worst paws but still not feeling great. I was drinking last night on NYE, just mildly buzzed, but hampered enough. I started wondering if there was anything in my old smoke cupboard that I had missed when I cleaned it out. So I dig through it and sure enough, found two little butts mostly charred. I stared at them, then at the clock and decided to try the “you can smoke in an hour but not right away” trick. Thinking it was already midnight and I’d fall asleep first. 

Well, that addict in me kept me wide awake and after an hour had past I made a makeshift bong and lit up. I observed myself while doing this and it’s like I was totally on autopilot or like someone else was running my body. It was really strange. Anyway I barely got high, ate half a jar of peanut butter, and this morning feel just disgusting, foggy, and exhausted. 

In the past, day 1 after relapse was the biggest risk. I’d feel like a failure and just go smoke because I lost confidence / hope in myself. 

This time is different. I’m able to recognize that I held off for an hour, and while that may sound pathetic to some, for me that’s not something I could’ve done without that 3 weeks of sobriety. The other thing is I’m actually not down about my relapse at all. Addicts gonna addict, and I was dumb enough to not do a thorough enough cleaning job. If it’s in my house I will smoke it. Realistically some part of my mind probably came up with an excuse to do a bad job cleaning so I’d be able to scrounge in the future. 

Well now I know for sure there’s not any more in my house, and even after smoking I systematically destroyed and dismantled what I had left. This is pretty unbelievable self control coming from someone who has given up many times on the ability to have any self control whatsoever. 

Progress is progress. Let’s keep picking ourselves up day after day.",10

2020-01-01 11:18:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eik0mr/dealing_with_withdrawal_in_social_settings/,Dealing with withdrawal in social settings,"In social settings, I find that dealing with withdrawal can be more stressful than when you are alone. I believe this due to the fact that when you are in a social setting, you are expected to act a certain way; positive, charismatic, outgoing. So, as you can probably imagine, the symptoms of withdrawal impede on this societal expectation, as when going through weed detox, the symptoms consist of depression, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness, etc. So I come to you guys with a couple of tips on dealing with the bad head space weed withdrawal creates in social settings.

* Take time to yourself in a private place when things get too much

\- Bathroom is always a good safe space to sit in silence and let whatever mood swing you have or negative thought pass.

* Talk to a close trusted friend/ Share your feelings

\- I find that when I acknowledge what I'm feeling around a friend, I tend to stop thinking so irrationally and put things into perspective. Calms me down

* Breathing exercises

\- Breathing excersies releases a signal to your brain telling it to calm down. This in due reduces anxiety and stress in moments where you feel like there is no escape 

These 3 things have continuously helped me through my numerous trials of trying to quit marijuana, hope they are of some help to the leavers in this community, HAPPY NEW YEAR AND FUCK WEED",14
2020-01-01 11:14:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eijytz/happy_2020_everybody_if_youre_new_here_welcome/,"Happy 2020 everybody! If you're new here, welcome! Have a look at the sidebar rules and the notes about our community below, and then introduce yourself! We want to hear your story.","Hi, I'm Subduction, the founder and a moderator of /r/leaves.

First and foremost, it's great to have you here and I'm glad you decided to come to see what we're about. 

Since how we act towards each other is the only thing that makes this place as special as it is I just wanted to take an opportunity for some reminders for newcomers and old-timers alike.

**Who We Are**

This is a subreddit for people who have made the decision to quit cannabis, edibles, or other THC products.  The only people we're not suited for are people who have the intention to continue smoking or return to smoking.  

That includes moderation management, tolerance breaks, ""I just need to get away from it for a while,"" or ""I need help getting through the next few months while my dealer's on vacation.""

It's hard for people trying to quit for good to have discussions with people who are still smoking or intending to start again, so we keep our focus pretty narrow.

**Who We Are Not**

The thing that sets /r/leaves apart from most of the other subreddits is that people come here at what is often the worst time in their lives.  They feel bad and have little love for the world or anyone in it.

So one of the few rules we very firmly enforce is that we are a *support* community.  We are here to help each other, creating an accepting community and a welcome place to be.  I know the rest of reddit can be rough-and-tumble, but that ends at the /r/leaves front door.

Even if you disagree with someone, if you are rude, dismissive, or any other flavor of impatient we will moderate your posts or comments out, and if you make a habit of it we will ban you.  

If you cannot find a supportive way to communicate with people, find a way to disagree with them in a respectful way, or guide people with what you think are wrong ideas in a gentle and understanding way, then you should not comment.

**Dealing With Problems**

If someone is trolling, seems to have missed the point of the group, is soapboxing in a way contrary to our mission, or anything else that might tick you off, **do not comment, and use the report button.**  That brings it to the mods' attention where we can review it. Use the report button early and often, it's really a help.

Again, however, please don't comment.  That just gives trolls more opportunities to keep trolling.

To keep modding from being too crazy we use Automod keyword filters that automatically holds posts relating to some topics for review by the mods.  We review every single Automodded post, but sometimes we can mess up, so if you aren't seeing your post and think it's somehow stuck feel free to message the mods.

**How /r/leaves Works Best**

The point of /r/leaves is many helping one and one helping many.  I know it's tempting to be a lurker, but unless we share our experience then no one has any lessons to learn.

Please post often and comment often.  Just the process of writing out your posts helps you and posting them helps others.  

We now get over **100,000** unique users a month here at /r/leaves so even a small participation can help a whole lot of people.

Thanks very much for arriving here, and we look forward to seeing your progress posts and great stories ahead!

I remember relapsing after 2 months, and promised myself to never do it again. I remember telling myself, you don't need to be dependent on a substance. 

I remember telling myself, that shit is no good for. I remember telling myself I might as well keep smoking, these dam withdrawals are hell. I remember telling myself you can't do this. I remember telling myself, I got this, if others can do it I can too. I remember saying it gets better, just keep fighting. I remember telling myself, don't stop now, don't let it beat you, you beat it. I remember telling myself, fuck weed, I finally have cash in the bank. I remember telling myself, I am determined to get through this. I remember telling myself, this too will pass.

Talking to yourself, convincing yourself, motivating yourself are the first steps in changing your mindset.  Which will eventually change your behaviors. Willpower only goes so far.",55

So I decided the new year was a good chance to start fresh, but instead of smoking right up to the ball drop on NYE, I decided to stop a day earlier to show myself I was serious. Now I'm somewhere around 30 hours in and feeling a bit clearer headed, but also anxious and irritable. This too shall pass.

This is extra hard right now because I'm at home for the holidays and almost all my family are all-day every-day smokers, and most of the time we spend together revolves around passing around a bong or a joint. But I explained to most of them what I'm doing, and so far no one has tried to cut me down. My family tend to be very defensive about most things, and I'm almost certain that at some point my quitting will be taken as a judgment against them (or is this the paranoia talking?) and will lead to some kind of conflict. But that's (maybe) in the future, and all I can do is live right now. At this moment, everything is going fine and I'm thankful to be alive, healthy, and motivated.

Good luck this year to all of you. I'm so inspired by the people posting one and two-year anniversaries here the last couple days, and I hope a lot of us will join them in doing so when 2020 comes to a close. We got dis!",3

Last year at new years, I was cross faded, but mostly just really high. So high, in fact, that after midnight I called my mom to see if she could pick me up and totally forgot to say happy new year. She was excited when I called because she thought I was being thoughtful because she was home alone and she was really hurt by this. I felt dreadful and it was the worst way to start the new year. I know I would have never done that if I wasn't so baked.

This year, I can't count how many smoking opportunities there were to get high. Everyone kept telling me to come outside and hit the blunt (I'm known for loving to get high at parties). In the back of my head I was thinking, ""this is the last night of 2019, why not smoke now and be clean for the new decade?"" But I knew that A) this was addict thinking and B) I would still be high when the clock strikes 12, so it wouldn't really be starting clean at all! Instead, I just drank. I called my mom at 12:01 and said happy new year, by which she was delighted.

I’ve tried to quit two or three times in 2019, at least once for longer than a month. Quitting can be a gradual process, as it has been for me. Maybe this is the culmination of all those seesaw attempts. 

And if this is just temporary, or an “experiment” that’s fine too. Just, whatever the circumstances, commit to your goal and to yourself. Give yourself a chance. Use the benchmark as an OPPORTUNITY to see if you are capable of more 

I’m lucky in a way. My bag ran out in the latter half of NYE, just by coincidence. But I’d become fed up in so many ways in the weeks leading up to it. I’d become cognizant of all the things I’ve lost to time because of this drug. Not that I wasn’t before, but it’s become so real with the specter of the new year looming. We’re all getting older. The years pass. The single most poisonous element of my spirit is regret. All these regrets I don’t want to allow to conquer me but that are undeniable. Weed wasn’t the main orchestrator of these events, it was merely the co-conspirator. The enabler that kept me buried below layers of haze and distraction. 

Allow yourself to FEEL the regret that weed buried so deep within you. Allow yourself to feel the pain of lost and stolen years and squandered potential, lost loves and loved ones passed. From here, there can only be forward

I realized in a very real way, beyond the platitudinal truth, that I used weed to erase the bad feelings. Only, feelings and memories are what make us who we are. Without them, we’re only the weed. That fear of not knowing who I am without weed; it’s a source of great shame for me, and a source of crippling anxiety. I’m nearly 30 now, and I’m starting over. It’s not easy, fun, or hopeful. But it’s real. 

I choose to be me, not the weed. I choose to be real, and everything that comes with that. I hope for those of you that have made the mistakes I have, that you’ll choose life right alongside me. Let’s see if we can learn to love ourselves. Happy New Year.",14

2020-01-01 01:28:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eif4q5/day_1/,Day 1,"Here I go again! I just want to post for the record that today I am quitting marijuana. I have been quitting since 2016 and have posted on this site many times. I just read through them all actually and Wow! I was full on. I can really see how it all went down. So much anger and reflection on the past. So aggressive at one point. 

My last post on old Reddit was the end of 2017. From there I gave up for 42 days straight no cheating. I used exercise and good eating and just didn't allow myself to give in to any cravings or thoughts of smoking, I was committed. I then had to return to work in January 2018 and the day before, I went into some type of inner rage. I was furious to have to see some of the people where there has been extreme work conditions and bullying. I caved thinking I couldn't go back feeling that way, having to pretend everything is fine and be able to be friendly. I found myself needing to smoke through the term and give up over the holidays, only to return to smoking once the school years starts. It's clearly the job!

I wanted to give quitting another good go as I had the previous Summer with 42 days strong under my belt. I wanted a good amount of time cleared to focus on quitting and it needed to be at least 90 days. I was owed a long service leave so I thought let's do this in the final term and then extend into summer of 2018 with a full 4 months off and made the arrangements. So exciting!

Of course, sometimes nothing goes to plan. I started by doing a big clean up of the house. Kept dabbling in the smoking but eventually picked a date and started my journey. During the bad early days, I felt  distraction could be good and convinced my husband to go for a short trip up north with the dog. I then changed my mind and decided we should go to the Great Barrier Reef and do some snorkeling which meant our beautiful 8 year old Schnauzer would have to stay at the kennel. What a mistake!! They lost him for Christ's sake on the day of our return and after a frantic 12 days of chasing him around the bush and suburban areas, he disappeared. I think fell in the river. Shocking stuff. There was then legal issues to deal with over the incident and settlement with their insurance company. We were so furious! I was DEVASTATED!! He was my baby. It was like losing a child.

For a year now I have been in shock and have really grieved the loss of my Jesse. I still can't believe it happened. The other evening I saw an Australian movie on TV called Red Dog and in the movie Red Dog's owner died in a motor cycle accident. The dog waited at his house for 3 weeks then walked all over Western Australia looking for him. True story! I wailed and wailed for my boy. Really sad stuff, so you can imagine that any quitting through 2019 was non-existent. I couple of flimsy attempts. Had a 24 hour period off the other day.

It's an obvious day to quit. At least I'll be able to keep track of days and will enjoy my new Cavapoo whose been with us for a year now.

Best of Luck to all the New Year Quitters! I haven't been perfect today but I'm still calling it DAY 1.",10

After doing some reading here, I realized I wasn't fully prepared when I tried quitting before. Never had an emergency plan for what to do if I get an intense craving. 

So I'm gonna use some language learning when feeling like smoking. I feel like doing something productive instead of smoking might keep me motivated. 

I'm gonna check in with a buddy daily and reach out if times get hard

and

Put away all my smoking gear. Having it out is triggering. Out if sight, out of mind.
