I'd smoke one pinch of weed, in one of those glass pipes. Usually enough for 2 decent puffs. I thought this was not much, and would do it 1-4 times a week, probably averaging twice a week. 

I'd finish work on Friday, do all my chores/errands, then light up, relax, order pizza and watch a movie with my partner. It was a level of relaxation I had not felt in a long time, it felt amazing. My partner even enjoyed my state of mind, as I was funnier and we had deep conversations. Although she has never touched it, this gave me the go ahead in my mind to smoke when ever I wanted. I had her approval. So just smoking on Fridays eventually turned in to Saturday nights and then sometimes Sunday nights. It left me feeling guilty because I knew it affected my performance at work.

I had quit because I want to be 100% there for my family. I want my mind to be sharp, and I want to be reliable and have a stable mind. I don't want any crutches or anything weighing me down.

Right now I am on day 6 and I have some withdrawal symptoms. Sleeping is hard, no appetite and intense nausea and vomitting. I thought I was a light smoker but the withdrawals are bad, I want to smoke again so bad.

Hoping someone can give me some encouragement and let me know how long this will go on for. Thanks for reading my story. Hope others can relate and get some inspiration to stick with it.",7,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46683002}"

For context am 17 and have been smoking  regularly for about 2 years and daily for about a year and a half. I first smoked with my  twin sister freshman year of high school and eventually ended up smokeing daily to help stress and anxiety with my dad who had smoked sense his early teens i don't think i ever  smoked a excessive amount usely only a few bowls or a joint or 2 a day and had always intended on quitting new years of 2022 as I plan on joining an electricians union with a no drug policy out of high school. But in October of 2021 I came home from school to find my dad had passed in his sleep at the age of 67 this sent me into a spiral not going to school and I was basically constantly high from then until January 17 only being sober for his funeral smokeing 1-2 grams a day completely abandoning my quit date. Eventually I decided I needed to quit as I wasn't letting myself process his death properly with being stoned constantly along with i needed to to think about my future and whenever I smoked he was all I could think about as he had been the only person I regularly smoked with . Nearly 2 weeks after quitting I can say I am so happy I did as I've gone back to school and have been doing well in my classes and have been sleeping much better and have been trying to exercise more. What prompted me to write this was tonight I found a roach inside a pill bottle my dad had tucked away in our garage I looked at it and immediate smiled and eventually started crying missing him but I didn't smoke it but can't throw it out not that I plan to or want to smoke it but just need to keep it as a memento am so proud I made it this far and have been able to restrain myself from smokeing as my sister still dose so there's always weed accessible to me. I feel that I was emotionally dead the months following his death and just kept pushing down the feelings useing weed to stay numb . After I quit realized I need to fell those feelings so I could heal and be there for my mom and sister. sorry for the novel but I just wanted to share this. Also my dad never influenced me to smoke I  didn't even know he did until I was a teenager and had been wanting to smoke for a while and never felt forced to smoke by him and will cherish those memories I have of him while smokeing as it helped us communicate and bond, thanks for reading.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46685562}"

Ended up having a burst of rage and did something that shattered the lies I've been telling my dad for years, so I knew that I could no longer hide my addiction. 
The day after me and my parents were already talking about what we should do, and because of personal circumstances I ended up on this rehab clinic next to my mom's house, but with a ""special treatment"". I do not live in said clinic, but rather just spend all day there and then go back with my mom at night.

I feel a lot of things about this: For starters, I wasn't ready to stop but rather my actions forced me to do it, I moved with my mom (Divorced parents) and no longer see my cat, which was my only company for the whole last year, I'm already missing him a lot and have the paranoia of someone killing him, like my previous one. Then there's the people at the clinic; as stupid as this sounds, I feel guilty being there, everyone else is there for way worse things that starts with C, or severe booze addiction, except me, I feel like I'm wasting someone else's space in that place, someone with a worse addiction.

I don't really feel intense cravings or have any physical withdrawls or very vivid dreams. Despite spending years as a lazy stoner who didn't work nor studied, I don't feel the symptoms many here describe, and it feels weird knowing how much I used to smoke daily.

Do I still think about smoking and drinking? Yes, but it's not a super intense feeling, I can handle it, and I hate that. I got so used to feeling like shit that I still want to feel that way; getting better feels weird and ""unnatural""

I have a lot of frustration right now. I said I wanted to be there to get help but now I'm getting scared and angry and sad and confused, and I feel like I shouldn't be there, it's like I just told my parent I was gonna go there because that's what I thought they wanted to hear.

I also feel uncomfortable talking about my issues with the other interns, since I'm afraid behind their kind words they're judging me for not being as bad as them. I'm, by a long shot, the """"least worst"""" in there. That place is pumping my comparisson problems to eleven. Also I'm taking this stupid med that gets me sleepy at 9 A.M. so it's kinda hard to concentrate during the morning group sessions. 

There are some good things though: They have an improvised gym so I exercise daily, I'm also eating better since they have doctors that plan the menu for the week, and despite what I said, the people in there are actually very friendly and supportive, it's really just my mind messing with me.

Sheeesh, that was the condensed version, the whole deal is reserved for my therapists in there, but yeah, I had to let these things out since I don't go there every day, only 5 days a week.

I got through it and something in my mind said: “If I have enough discipline to stop smoking forever then maybe I have enough discipline to only smoke once a week…as a treat.” I know my partner would help to keep me accountable for smoking once a week but I don’t think it would be good for my mental health. My partner is something else though…he is one of those people that is able to control how much he smokes a day and has never had the issue of using too much like I would. But he also does not face mental health issues like I do. 
Unfortunately, I’ve been using weed as a way to escape my boredom and many of my thoughts. Weed is fun and I think I’ve been having too much fun & it’s been difficult because now I actually have to get my life together. 
I think I’m rambling at this point but I just want to hear advice from people who face the same issues I have with my weed consumption. How do I accept the fact that I may never smoke again? I know I will have to accept that side to succeed being sober instead of hoping one day I will smoke again. That’s the hardest part I think…feeling like I won’t have able to have fun again.

For the past few weeks I haven't been enjoying my usual joints throughout the day.

This is something that I'm extremely embarrassed/upset about. I wish I knew the true effects that this beautiful smelling plant would of had in my life.

I smoked addictively for 7 years and this is my third time quitting in the last three years and I'm feeling like it's going to stick. It was hard for the first three months..weed caused pretty severe depression and it temporarily got worse when I quit, then around 5 months things really started to turn around.  I got a new job that I actually like! I wouldn't have been able to pull off changing jobs if I was always high. I've been working out and feel great physically! Also something I couldn't do in a fog. I'm participating in hobbies and connecting more with friends.  Tonight I realized I'm even cooking much better  I used to lazily throw stuff together and overcook or otherwise screw it up most of the time. My kids are happy I'm clear headed and not so dopey and forgetful. I haven't had any car accidents. But the best thing is that I'm not listening to a constant stream of negative self talk and paranoid thinking in my head! I'm actually at peace and grateful most of the time. This is the greatest gift of quitting. Today I had a little ""twinge"" when I was getting ready to go out to shovel out from a blizzard, because in the old days that would have been my favorite time to smoke. But I didn't.  I went out and got my work done and listened to the birds chirping and noticed the beauty of nature just as much if not more than before and I was so happy!

Then when you're feeling down or ashamed or w/e, you get the thoughts/urges about smoking. You know that it doesn't help, and you're actually feeling down *BECAUSE* of being addicted and feeling out of touch with yourself, unable to think clearly for so long. This plant has influenced my thinking, actions and behavior for years, while I didn't really notice it at first.

I'm about 2 weeks completely clean, I find that my memory is getting better and I can have laughs over smaller stuff and be interested in things other than just getting high. Sometimes though, I feel irritable over minor things and have little patience, and I know it's mostly because of the (chemical dependence) recovery progress, and that's when the regrets may come in, to justify the behavior of smoking or hedonism to escape the negative emotion that I'm feeling. But deep down I know it's just an urge, and will not help me. Can't run forever, and I shouldn't, because I'll feel worse.

I do feel so much better and at peace than when I first quit, and I'm glad that I've not touched weed for what seems like a short and a long time all at the same. I've had dreams about weed recently, and there's all kinds of weird shame/guilt/selfishness themes going on in them, like really just wanting to smoke weed is the priority, but having to hide it from my family for example and I'm so afraid and ashamed to be found out, and missing bunch of events and opportunities because of getting high.

It's the first time that I'm spending nights out with my smoking friends sober and i'm making some weird realisations, which is, I can't make decent conversations which reflects my current interests and recreation with them. It's strange how I could just go to my buddy, smoke a big one and just laugh braindead with youtube movies or watch a movie but forgot the entire plot at the credits but that I'm now at a stage where I want to have a decent good meaningful evening to build on my friendship. It's gnawing on me that it's not working out anymore with my buddies on the social note in such a short time. I'm also the only one in the group with a spouse and a plan to build on my relationship whilst my buddies are locked each possible moment behind their PC

For example, I asked my friend out for a boardgame night last weekend with my spouse which we do often but then I would smoke along and we would just be noisy and play some games with no actual attention. Now I stayed sober and after 2 hours my friend just was so gloomy and high that everytime me or my spouse started a conversation with him it would go to nowhere. 

So since I've smoked for 16 years, my friendgroup is build on all but one 24/7 smokers and the one that does not smoke lives 2 hours away with the car. Maybe since I was always stoned when I was with my friends I just didn't see some things but now some aspects are getting clear me now that I'm sober. Not sure if it is unhealthy to maintain these kind of relationships because now I'm sober I don't have the urge to visit on the same routine as before. Also I work in shifts so it's not that easy, also with covid, to create new friendships out of the blue.
Are there more people who experienced this in some way or another? Any tips are welcome aswel, because I feel bad to have these thoughts but on the other hand I want to make some new steps in life now I've got fresh motivation and plans instead of being let down or just feel bad after visiting some friends.",7,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45274204}"

My grandma passed away peacefully in her sleep on Friday night. I flew out to help take care of her about a week before she passed. My mom and I were her caretakers for at-home hospice.

I’m eternally thankful I quit weed as a New Year’s resolution. I was able to tend to my grandma without being high, without experiencing withdrawal or agitation, without needing to sneak off, without dishonoring her or her memory, and I was able to give her my full energy and attention. I’ve also been able to experience my emotions unaltered. It’s been surreal and I’ve felt numb, but I know it’s a natural part of the grieving process and not the weed.

It was hard, but going through this week as an active stoner would have been so much harder. Thanks for this community. It’s been a big help.

I lost my vape pen last weekend. No idea how high-me lost something so thoroughly in such a small apartment, but so it goes... guess I'll keep this sober streak going.

I've been hooked on weed for about 8 years now, starting my last year of college. Last time I quit was 3 years ago, for about 6 months... then winter came around and I got bored. There have been dry days here and there but nothing intentional or sustained.

Getting high has always been a coping mechanism. I know exactly how to have an enjoyable high - take one or two hits then go exercise with music for a couple hours. Feels amazing, and I rarely did that. I was on autopilot after that first hit, and the autopilot always went higher. Smoking weed was about quieting my mind, feeling stupid and accepting vegging out... ""is my breathing too loud""-anxiety often felt better than normal.

Work was my self-enablement excuse... getting high to deal with stressful work, then the next-day brainfog perpetuates the stressful situations at work. Friday/Saturday evenings were of course the time to get even more blazed, leading to doing fuckall over the weekend and feeling like shit. Anytime I was around people, I was either getting high or coming down, never present in the moment. 

This past week has been about unlearning some of that, living in the present moment and exploring my subconscious behaviors... I can feel it's a deep problem, my ""default thinking"" is still drawn towards other maladaptive distractions like news binges, social media scrolling, browsing endless Youtubue, etc... I hope continuing to cut and guard against toxic traits will leave room to grow and learn about myself.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4018349}"

Is there anybody out there who has also gone through this? Really need some advice.,"Hey guys,

Today I hit 1 week sober after smoking pretty much all day every day for the last 10 years. I seem to be over the worst of the withdrawal and I'm already picking up some really healthy habits like running and cooking. I've also reconnected with old friends I wouldn't normally see, as they didn't smoke. I mostly feel great and I'm feeling incredibly proud of myself.

However...

For the past few years I've been passionately working towards my dream job as a sound designer for games, and achieved this dream last summer. I've loved every second of it, up until now. This last week has really got me down because I just have no interest or motivation to do sound design since quitting weed. I really do want to excel in my career, but this last week has me thinking that I may be doomed to fail without the influence of weed in my life. I really thought quitting would increase my drive and passion, rather than reduce it.

Have any other creatives here who quit weed gone through the same thing? Did the passion come back? I really hope so as this is hands down the worst part about quitting. I feel so down :(

First, for context, I just want to say that I have OCD, so direct reassurance (“You’re fine!” “It’s nothing!”), while helping my anxiety in the short term, fuel it in the long term. 

I quit smoking about two weeks ago. I was smoking blunts with oil in them, so about 45% THC. I would smoke after work until sleep, and on the weekends, it would be from 8am until sleep. 

I was doing fine other than irritability for a while, but a couple days ago, around day 11, I woke up and felt like I was completely in a daze. Disconnected from the world, finding myself sitting and staring and not moving. It lasted all day. I came home that night and slept until the next morning. 

The next day, yesterday, I slept in and off most of the day, with brain fog coming in and out. Today is more of the same, but with a little less sleep. My vision feels a bit blurry, though that could be from staring at my phone every waking moment :) I’ve also had a bit of an uptick in tinnitus. 

Is this something that any of you have experienced? I just want to make sure I don’t make yet another unnecessary trip to the doctor lol.

I don't feel dizzy or anything just very uncomfortable like if I just ate a meal without chewing it.
  
  
I was a stoner for 4+ months, so I feel like possibly (due to consistent lack of saliva from dry mouth) that maybe the lining of my stomach has been worn away.  Also, with the amount that I smoked, I don't think saliva production is up to normal quite yet.
  
  
Needless to say, eating is a bit of a challenge.  I've been making peanut-butter and banana blends with almond milk and that gets me enough calories and is relatively palatable, but doesn't fill me up because it's just liquid.
  
  
What can I do to make eating easier?  Is there a drug that can help restore my stomach lining (if that's the problem)?  Should I just start taking heartburn meds before eating?  I don't have heartburn, but maybe they will cause my stomach to freak out less.

When I was first introduced to weed, I only did it recreationally, a few times a week. For the last 5 years, it developed into a daily habit. I was high all day, every day. I struggled to quit throughout last year, only lasting a week or two before I caved and went back to smoking. This time is different though - I made the realization that weed has become harmful to my mental and physical health and I’m ready to make this change. Each day I’m starting to feel more and more like myself, and I’m even feeling happy again. 

The reason for my post today is to share about some of my withdrawal symptoms in order to see if anyone has had similar experiences. I have nausea almost everyday, but I found that exercise really helps to suppress that. The bigger concern is that I’m having stomach issues with almost anything I eat. I get diarrhea or loose bowels almost every time I go to the bathroom. I’m sorry if this is TMI…but has anyone experienced this particular symptom as well? If so, what have you done to help with this? 

I’d like to add that this sub has been so instrumental to my sober journey. I wouldn’t have been able to make it this far without reading some of your stories.

Last day I smoked was Sep. 4- I am now clean for 146 days. It hasn't always been easy and the temptations do you come up. I was a daily smoker for 7 years. The longest that I had gone without smoking and that whole time was maybe 2 months. That was torture. I would smoke concentrates as well as flower. I wouldn't just smoke everyday I would smoke copious amounts everyday. I live in a legal state, and obtaining weed was ridiculously simple. I know many growers who would just give me anything I wanted for free, or an extremely discounted price. It wasn't hurting my wallet much, but if I went to a dispensary I would spend a good amount.

The first few weeks were miserable. I was detoxing from THC as well as nicotine. I hadn't been smoking nicotine for long, but I was at least two or three months into the addiction. The withdrawals from both were atrocious. I would have night sweats... Only when and if I could fall asleep... I would wake up in pools of my sweat saturating my bed sheets. My wife was detoxing at the same time from both substances as well, which made things even worse. We were both extremely irritable, and it was easy for us to react to negative stimuli.

I had nightmares... I usually find scary dreams pretty interesting, but some of these were quite disturbing. Still... thinking back on them they were quite interesting. I dream a lot now. I'm not too sure about how my mental clarity has improved. I've known myself to be sharp, and I do well in school and work. Much of the same after quitting. One of the best things that I have gained is the ability to drive whenever I want. Those first few weeks of being able to run to the store at any time of the night was freeing.

The reason for me posting is that over the past few months I've been having reoccurring dreams of smoking. Not just smoking, but relapsing. I always know that I'm relapsing because I make a point of bringing it up in the dream. I'm not going to lie, I miss weed. I won't go into the details of why, because I'm sure you all know. I want to smoke again... I go through reasons in my head as to why it wouldn't be so bad. I also know that as soon as I start smoking I would eventually have no discipline, and smoking would become a regular occurrence. It's easier to not smoke than to start again. 

I just need some words of encouragement and people that are going through the same thing. I know it's in my best interest to keep clean. I hope you all have a wonderful day and I encourage you all to keep working on your goals.

However one thing I noticed is i was alot more aware and less reluctant to put things off.  (Went and got my hair braided for the first time, went shopping for hair products, just general self care stuff).  

Last night i woke up sweating profusely from my first vivid dream in recent memory.  Today, i feel pretty good.  I dont feel amazing sure, i still have thoughts about weed here and there.

She doesn't exactly approve of me smoking, but it's not a dealbreaker at all. However, she has no idea as to the extent of my addiction, as I don't smoke around her, and make great care to get rid of any odor/bloodshot eyes. She thinks I smoke maybe 5x/week, rather than about 25x/week. She has no idea that I'm extremely addicted, and has no idea about weed withdrawal.

I want to quit. However, we all know how withdrawal is. Mood swings, insomnia, anxiety, night sweats, GI issues. You're not yourself for at least two weeks. I've never even had sex while not high (sometimes I've done it \~12-16 hours after smoking, but still with a weed hangover and not in full withdrawal).

I'm very nervous as to how this will go, and would feel bad asking for her support in going through this, as she had no idea going into the relationship. I feel like she'd think I was pathetic for being so addicted to weed.

Honestly, my smoking was a big reason I was unemployed for so long. I was unmotivated and hopeless, and making just enough off of unemployment insurance to get by. Thankfully, during a stretch of sobriety in September-October, I finally landed a job offer.

When I started my job, I told myself I deserved to smoke again. I had a new job, which meant my days would finally have some structure. I would work during the day and smoke at night to unwind. Surely this new job would help me establish healthy habits like a normal person, right?

Wrong.

Within a week or two, I was smoking during the work day (I work remotely from home, where no one can smell me and I can get away with remaining quiet on a Zoom call). It started out as smoking half a joint when I had an open afternoon, but eventually I was waking up and smoking every morning at 8am before my morning call with my team. Then another bowl around 10am. Then another bowl around lunch time. I wasn't even getting high anymore. I was just numbing myself and wasting my days away.

Two weeks ago, my girlfriend dumped my ass. I don't think she was aware of how much I was smoking. Frankly, I don't think I was aware of it either. But I'm glad she did. It served as the wakeup call I needed.

I've since taken a long hard look in the mirror. I realized that weed just isn't something I can moderate. Alcoholics can't enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. I can't enjoy a bowl before bed. That's just my reality and I need to accept that.

I'm exercising. I'm journaling. I'm reading. I'm eating healthier. I'm actually trying at my job. I'm taking baby steps to becoming the man I want to be. It's challenging but rewarding.

I still have a long way to go. Going through a breakup while battling an addiction in the depths of NYC winter is proving to be quite the perfect storm of shit. But I'm proud of myself. Proud for identifying a problem in my life, rolling up my sleeves, and fixing it. No matter how easy it would be to fall right back into my old habits for some temporary relief.

But I'm not going back.

TL;DR: Weed prolonged my unemployment, found a job, but fell back into my bad habits until I realized I can't smoke, period.",15,"{'pandemic': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40555292}"

Just random ranting here.

Before quitting, I built a personal curriculum for career and personal development which is going to be quite difficult but rewarding for me by summer time. I executed it perfectly and never felt that kind of mental clarity in so long and I was very proud of myself. I learned that I don't even have ADHD and it was all weed that made me believe I might.

Then the relapse happened.  I had to sleep over at someone else's house but I needed weed to fall asleep there and ended up sleeping terrible as a result. I would have slept bad anyway because I have insomnia but I was doing a great job of mitigating it until I slept somewhere else. The following 2-3 days is a nightmare because I can't stay focused on my curriculum the same way I did when I was fully sober (I'm studying computer science). The anxiety kicked in so intensely and I can't end the negative thought cycles so I have to take another day off until I recover again fully so I can bounce back. When I was watching my course I had to re-watch some videos over 5 times to grasp the concepts vs only needing to watch it once when I was fully sober. My fitness goals also took a major toll after the relapse (because of the sleep debt/lack of energy).

Just ranting here but I guess what I'm trying to say is it is never worth it no matter how tempting it is. I also learned that I will not take any risks by sleeping over somewhere else until I have addressed my insomnia because it just leads to more weed smoking. Keep in mind I was only a night time smoker and it still impacted me very negatively. It is also crazy how much I can learn while being sober vs having thc in my system. It is a game changer for sure and it felt like I can go at my own pace. Right now my motivation went straight back to 0 again but I promise I'll be back and going harder than ever. The most important thing is recognizing that relapse is inevitable and it didn't wipe away the progression. More importantly, I will not give up no matter how long quitting takes.",11,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41350797}"

2022-01-29 13:05:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sfns8j/day_1_of_quitting_weed/,Day 1 of Quitting Weed,"I have been smoking weed for 15 years and for at least 10 of those years, I attempted to quit weed probably thousands of times. Each time I “decide” to quit, I am so clear in my mind of why I should quit, and “feel” ready to let it go… but by the end of the day, I end up changing my mind. This pattern continues to exist to this day, and it makes me feel kind of crazy because it’s such an obvious cycle that happens every single day. 

I’m 34 years old now, and over the past decade managed to quit cigarettes, go from binge eating junk food to now eating healthy the majority of the time, complete a Bachelor of Business degree, a Bachelor of Nursing degree, have a successful career… The reason I am sharing this is because I have proven to myself that I can do hard things and am capable of a lot when I put my mind to it, but when it comes to quitting weed… I just can’t seem to figure that one out. What I find frustrating is that even when I tell myself “just go for 24 hours, don’t focus on quitting”, I can’t seem to make it a full 24 hours most of the time. I don’t even necessarily smoke a whole lot each day, but can’t seem to get past a day without “just a little buzz”.

95% of the time when I smoke it, I feel WORSE than the moment before I smoked it. I tend to feel more anxious, worry more, my mind becomes way more scattered, busy (lots of mind chatter, images - it overall becomes way louder), I feel more groggy and cloudy… but there’s part of me that feels comfort in that fog. I feel almost a “fuzzy” sensation that emotionally feels similar to wearing a cozy blanket in front of a fire place - like a comfort blanket. Without weed, my mind becomes way more calm - but I get a sense that there is something missing, and I feel more like a blank canvas - exposed to “the void”. The best way I can describe it is that I feel “naked” in a sense, or “exposed to the cold” and am seeking my “warm comfort blanket” to wrap me up and keep me safe (Apologies if these analogies are unclear, trying my best to put words to the way I feel)",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49786294}"

I want to thank this community for being responsible for this feat.,"I made it. I'm so proud of myself. I don't even have the desire to start again. I have to work to make sure I don't, but not having the desire and being absolutely obsessed with my mind and how I am right now is magic all on its own. It's even more magic when I realize that THIS is more who I am than the person that smoked and got high and that I hated before. We may be one and the same, but I have a choice I can make every single day, and I'm finally making the right one. I actually threw my entire backpack of everything I had, backpack included because at this point it comes with the smell, in a garbage can yesterday. 

It's also a little over a month of no nicotine. 

I went through the sweats, I had a headache here and there, but other than that, everything is fine and more than worth it. Besides, it'll only even out more and more from here, and the promise of that is more than enough. 

I've been making and attending doctor's appointments - just for the little things I've been ignoring. But I have the desire to fix them now, coupled with the attention span and clear mind to go through with it, and not to scare myself off or tell myself they don't matter. Of course they matter... but it's a little harder when I know I'm harming my lungs with every inhale. This way, I consider everything as ""healing"" instead. It gives me more... idk, hope?  

With the concept of healing, at the suggestion of some of your comments, and a lot of reading about CBT, addiction, and general psychological and physical well being, I've decided that during this period of my life, I will be treating myself with self-compassion. It might be one of the better changes I'm making in my life all around. 

I can't explain how helpful this group is. I may not have a lot of Karma points, and I may not have spent too much time on Reddit in a long while, but even just a comment here or there, and mainly reading everyone else's experiences, no matter how similar or different, is it's own kind of therapy.

I wanted to give some advice that has helped me stop and keep sober so far where I've failed during the last 1.5 years I wanted to quit. First let me say that anxiety, depression, etc are very real and I am not discounting anyone experiencing psychological issues. I too am diagnosed as manic/depressive and have an anxiety disorder. This is how I've learned to deal with it and why I know tomorrow will be day 6 for me.

Don't assign negative emotions to your symptoms. If you feel sick, for example, then telling yourself it's unbearable, etc. is harder on yourself. It's of course not ideal and it's not what we want, but reinforcing negative feelings highjacks your rational brain. You stop thinking rationally and focus on how bad it sucks, which feeds back into itself and you spiral.

The more you can accept that they happen and realize you don't have to make them trigger negative emotional responses, the less likely you will be to give into them. A stomach ache, racing heart or sweating doesn't need to give you anxiety. It is possible to have the physical without letting it become emotional. This is not an overnight process, but if you stick with it, you will notice improvement.

For instance, feeling like I was going to throw up used to ruin my whole day because of spiraling. I basically gave up on the spot. Now I live with it instead of letting it control me and am in a much better place to stay sober than I was before. Breaking the negative feedback loop has also improved my symptoms because the anxiety I associated with it doesn't make them worse.

I am 6 days into quitting smoking weed, dabs, edibles and everything cannabis after a decade of getting high daily. I feel incredibly optimistic about it, cravings are minimal and easy to ignore. But I know I have a long life ahead of me, and I can never go back, not even one puff, so I'm mentally preparing myself for a lifetime of refusing to give in.

I really miss dreaming.

I can't remember the last dream I've had. Maybe I am getting dreams when I sleep, but if so, I'm not remembering them by the time I wake up.

My girl (who doesn't smoke weed) says she has vivid dreams all the time and that I make appearances in them. Well obviously I'd love to experience the same thing, but I feel as though weed has entirely ruined my ability to experience dreams.

I know dream suppression is a side effect of cannabis abuse. I'm wondering what I can reasonably expect as far as timeline for having dreams again. Am I getting ahead of myself? Is this not the kind of thing that resolves itself after only a few days?

If I knew it would take months to get my dreams back, I would wait months. This isn't to say I'd grow disappointed with it and decide ""well since I can't dream even after quitting, why quit at all?""

I will stay the course regardless. If I can never dream again, so be it, I'm fully committed to putting the addiction behind me and never picking up another joint or bong.

This conversation and others I had with my doctor during my yearly physical made me say out loud what I’ve always known deep down. My daily routine for the past year since the break up consisted of getting home from work (manual labor), taking a bong rip, watching porn, eating a bunch of junk food, and then going out with friends to drink beers and get more high. At the time I just told myself oh I’m only 19 years old everyone does this at my age but deep down I knew the harm it would cause me later in life and even currently. So pretty much I’ve quit porn and with that I stopped smoking too, although I didn’t tell myself I was done completely with smoking but instead was just going to limit it to smoking with friends occasionally. Yesterday after 20-25 days of not smoking (didn’t keep count) I smoked with a friend and it was cool at first obviously I got the dopamine release and got higher then I would in the past.

I’ve only known her for a year and she’s attempted to quit twice, then promptly starts again.

IDK what to do as I care for her, but also know she loves her boyfriend and pot despite the situation, but also their use is starting to affect our friendship. They literally show up late to every meeting, the bf (esp. when he is high) sometimes talks trash about the other friends we introduce them to, their apartment smells so bad that the smell carries out into the hallway and I think they’ve gotten a complaint, when we have dinner at their place they always are late to starting like they still need an hour or more to finish cooking or they actually finish on time but they get the munchies for something else and start making another dish that takes an extra hour, the bf sometimes begins rolling joints at other people’s houses without asking (the gf reprimands him for it being inappropriate and i agree), and just other constant small things that amount to a bigger irritation.

They’ve become our couple friend, they’re new in the city, and I tried introducing her to some people, but I suspect their addiction is making them just want to stay at home most of the time, and a few people I introduced to them kind of got a bad first impression either from them always being late or them smelling bad or the bf being moody and snapping at the gf in front of people or sometimes both of them - especially the bf - acting anti-social during social events. 

My partner is starting to get annoyed at the bf for trash talking his friends to him, and I am getting ticked at the lateness so we’ve begun to schedule meet-ups earlier than we plan on arriving.

Another thing is my friend stressing as she is staying in the country illegally as the bf kept cancelling or forgetting their appointments for getting her a visa at the immigration service 4 hours away and twice they went last year to an appointment despite the bf, who is her visa sponsor, literally forgetting his passport (and they of course got denied to apply).

Sorry for the long text. 

TLDR: new friend is addicted and wants to quit, but it seems her more addicted bf still smoking tempts her to regress and their weed-induced actions are kinda irritating and disrespectful of our time due to always being late or rescheduling or cancelling, and I think maybe it’s none of my business, but I kinda wanna help her, but don’t want outright confront her as it’d be awkward and out of my place.

Sometimes its hard to remember why we quit in the first place after some time sober, but I've solidified my motivation into definite reasons this time by looking at brain research. 

Here's a super quick, bastardized neuroscience lesson for you:

\-Weed is believed to negatively affect your prefrontal cortex (involved with complex thinking and decision making, among a million other things). 

\-It also increases activity in your amygdala in a way that could explain the anxiety/paranoia that some users feel (as well as diminished ability to cope with emotions)

\-It shrinks your hippocampus (involved with memory)

&#x200B;

I have these three facts written down on a flash card that I read every morning. Now here's another interesting neuroscience lesson:

\-Meditation has the exact opposite effects on your brain as everything listed above. It enhances your prefrontal cortex abilities, it shrinks your amygdala tissues (that's a good thing), and it can heal the damage done to your hippocampus (which would heal over time anyways, but why not speed it up?)

I have spent countless hours over the last ten years just stoned out of my mind and doing nothing in particular, so its easy for me to justify the 15 minutes a day just sitting and breathing. 

Go google all of this stuff for yourself, there are so many implications that might speak to you. I'm still not so consistent with meditation, but I have a reminder flash card to do it as well, and as a replacement coping mechanism for weed, its been effective to say the least.

Cannabis has been one of the few constants I've had in my life. Since I was little, I remember smelling it from my garden. My father has always been an active smoker, and as my brothers started growing up, they'd start smoking it too eventually, so I also started smelling it from their bedrooms and even in my own, since I used to share it with two of my brothers until they moved to another part of the house, leaving it to myself. We never really talked about it, so I grew up thinking it was a normal thing and never put too much thought into it while growing up. Then high school started and I became much more aware of what cannabis was and their side effects, which made me think in all those times my dad would get really irritable and unapproachable after smoking (in addition to a bunch of other situations taking place at my home), so I promised myself to never get involved with anything related to weed. And I kept that promise for a while actually, even when my brothers and some friends would suggest me to try it to deal with my eating, sleeping and anxiety related problems that were (and still are) many. I said no all of those times, even when I would have a joint practically tossed at my face. It was highly tempting, specially if you have in mind I had good quality cannabis waiting in my house (because of my father and brothers) anytime so I wouldn't even have to paid for it. When I was 15, I finally gave up at a party after watching all my friends doing it. I don't exactly remember how I felt that night, but when I managed to sleep for a good amount of time in a row and actually wake up feeling hungry and rested, I knew I had to do it again. And so I did. I started smoking only at parties at that time, and then when I turned 16 I would start doing it twice or thrice a week (which was a lot regarding my age, I know), then I would leave it for a month? Two weeks? do it again, give it a rest, repeat the vicious circle. When I smoked I felt relaxed, yes, but I'd also feel extremely sad for no reason and emotionally drained after a few hours and even the next day, only minutes after a drag in occasions too. And that's where I am now because even if I haven't smoked in a few weeks, the urge to do it has been creeping me all the time and growing wider, specially when the smell of cannabis hits through my window (I still live with my parents and brothers, and frequently they tend to smoke outside my room after dinner since it's located in between the kitchen and the garden, because my bedroom it's outside the house). I honestly don't want to smoke again and feel like I briefly mentioned before, but it's also really hard when you live with people that are constantly doing it :( does anyone have some advice on how can I deal with this?",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48289958}"

Quick Backstory (TW: Mention of suicide)

For the past three years of my life I've been dabbing all day everyday which has been a strain on my friendships and especially my relationships. In order to continue my addiction I had to completely isolate which lead to a deep depression. I haven't talked to my friends or family since I began smoking in my senior year of high school. I couldn't keep up with my college work so I dropped out which put me $15,000 in the hole with no class credits. I also became extremely paranoid during and between highs. I thought everyone hated me and was talking shit about me behind my back which was insanely stressful. I started to feel completely hopeless and began having vivid suicidal thoughts. The last night I smoked, I had an instance where I came scarily close to severely harming myself with a firearm. This scared the absolute shit out of me when I realized how serious I was about ending it all. I got rid of every last substance in my residence out of fear. With my addictive personality I knew I couldn't continue using weed (among other substances) without continuing to destroy my life as I knew it.

2022-01-28 23:45:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sfa6xq/my_30_years_of_using_marijuana/,My 30 years of using Marijuana.,"It all started at age 16. My parents were out of town for the weekend and I had my first bag of weed. I had smoked a few times but hadn't gotten high really. I remember that first feeling of being stoned out of my mind and was immediately drawn to it. 

Fast forward a few years. I pretty much followed the weed. All my friends were stoners and it was a big part of my identity and daily routine. I saw the Grateful Dead a few times before Jerry died, went to a bunch of Phish shows...pretty much was a total hippy. I taught and played piano in a few bands. Most of my decisions revolved around weed. I made some stupid choices being high and drunk. Got a girl pregnant, who I married at 21 and we had son together. I wouldn't call him a mistake by any means, but having a kid at 21 wasn't my best moment. The marrage ended when he was 3, though we are all still very close. 

So let's just fast forward to my early 30s. Still smoking daily. Still playing music. Still a hippy. I meet the girl of my dreams. She wasn't a pot smoker, but we connected on so many levels. We've been together for 11 years and pot has always been a problem for our relationship. About a year ago I quit drinking which helped. She didn't  mind the weed if I wasn't drinking.

At the age of 32 I wind up in the ER for stomach pain and vomiting. They say I have diverticulitis and we all move on. Over the course of the next 10 years I found that I very often had morning sickness and vomiting which I assumed was just a weak stomach or being hungover. About 6 months ago my wife runs across CHS on reddit and sends me a link. ""Wow"", I think. These symptoms fit the bill, but I am in denial that I could be one of the rare few. 

At the age of 34 I start a business that becomes pretty successful and start making killer money. Buy a house, nice car, nice things... my wife and I have a kid...things seem good. I'm saving money and living well. I'm making well into 6 figures a year at this point in my life.

I continue to smoke. Continue to have rough mornings. Continue to let it affect my relationship with my wife. Eventually I start driving to a neighboring legal recreational state to go to the dispensary. I'm spending lije $2k and coming home usually with a few ounces, some vapor pens, edibles, the works. Enough for 2 or 3 months.

I typically don't eat edibles, but after the trip I ate a bunch and felt insanely sick following each use. Nausea. Vomiting. I stop edibles immediately and go about my business. Still smoking daily. First thing when I wake and last thing before bed.

Fast forward to last week at the age of 45. I wake up with the usual stomach discomfort and immediately.know.what my days gonna look like. This happened to be a huge work day for me, a $3k+ day. This time was different though. The pain was worse than ever and non stop vomiting and pooping. Eventually I tell my wife she's got to take me to the ER. 

I go to the ER. The do a  Cat scan and find what they think is a telescoping intestine that possibly folded and was causing blockage. I continue to vomit at the ER. They do more scans and find that it must have either resolved itself or wasn't an issue after all. 

They keep.me overnight and the following morning they test literally everything. Heart, stomach, liver, you name it. Apparently I'm fine. I feel fine and I'm eating fine. Meanwhile, I'm sneaking a few drags off my vape pen. On the 2nd day they release me and I'm home. I smoke a pipe before bed and call it a shifty weekend. 

The very next day I wake up nauseous and puking again. We literally head right back to the ER. This time I tell the doctors about my use and that maybe it could be CHS. The doctor surprisingly knew all about it and says he sees a lot of cases these days. He mentions that they ruled pretty much everything else out and it's looking like i have CHS. I get discharged that same day.

I quit cold turkey on the spot. Mainly terrified of how I may feel if I smoke again. The sheer agony of how I felt is not worth feeling high for a bit. I've wanted to quit for a long while, but could never have the mental power to really give it a chance. 

Today is day 5 since I've smoked. I surprisingly feel like i am doing well with the cravings and withdrawl. My doctor gave me an anti anxiety medication and that seems to help. I also bought a nicotine free vape for something to take a drag from if needed. So far, so good. Other than being super irritable and having a quick temper, I'm eating fine and feel overall pretty good.

The symptoms haven't returned since the last time I was discharged from the hospital on Monday. I'm assuming I really do have CHS and I can't imagine ever smoking again. It's just not worth having Edward Scissorhands massage my intestines. I feel like things happen for a reason. I'm over the mental part of it and now it seems to just be physical. I'm looking forward to a better life, healthier body, relationship, focus and healing. Weed free and alcohol free.

In closing, I've let marijuana control my life for nearly 30 years. It's controlled much of my decision making. The friends I had soley because of drug use. I can't imagine how much money I've spent. And while i have found success in the last 10 years, how much more could I have done if I didn't let weed control me for.the last 30 years? I guess I'm happy to be here, right now. No more sickness in the morning and lots to look forward to.",57,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43778557}"

I just want to start by saying that I've received nothing short of incredible and inspirational support from this subreddit whenever I've posted in the past - I'm eternally grateful for this.

I've just accessed this account for the first time in ages and got pretty emotional reading back through my posts on this subreddit from last year. If you look back through my history you'll see a few posts from when I embarked on this journey initially, back in late Sep 2020.

To summarise, I was completely sober for 6 months from Oct 20 - April 21 (during lockdown) which in hindsight really was a tremendous achievement for a chronic smoker of 10 years. However after this, things started opening up again, the weather got nice and I quite quickly fell back into my old ways.

Despite the original 6 month streak and the momentum I'd gained it felt like a completely alien challenge to me when things opened up again. I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me as relative normality was returning after that lockdown, and I caved in spectacular fashion.

I still retained some fitness throughout this period, but the workouts and exercise became increasingly intermittent as my habit took hold once more. I also had more regular mini breaks of 2-3 days, but I would say I have only had about 7 of these mini breaks since April 21 (i.e. I've essentially been smoking regularly for the last 8 or 9 months).

So here I am again, day 3 - it's Friday night and I'm having to use quite literally all of my willpower to resist the urge to pick up. My palms are sweating profusely right now and I'm bursting with nervous energy. But hey, I've been here many times before and I'm acutely aware this is part of the process. What's helped me avoid picking up this eve is really trying to perceive and feel these physical symptoms and recognise this is my body doing it's best to expel this insidious drug from my system.

I really don't know where I was going with this post - it's just been a real struggle this eve so I thought I'd jot some stuff down as it's always helped me in the past.

After the day 2 I've had some major issues with a colleague and my bathroom in my house had a leak and has to be done all over since the entire wooden skeleton of that building room was destroyed. A month ago these 2 events would make me go to my studio and smoke a bud to ease my mind and forget about everyhting and hope other would do most of the work for me. This time, I've pulled through the emotions. Since I've always escaped these kind of emotions by smoking it was a rough ride. I would overthink, exaggerate and stress all things and that's exactly what happened. But the next day, something new happened. Instead of relaying on my dad and friends to do most of the works, I withdrew some money from my saving account and bought a decent of amount of working tools to do the job myself. Everyone in the family knew me as the lazy one who would have 2 left hands, simply because I never had motivation to do these kind of works. Now, in week 3 I've replaced all the wood panels of the bathroom with fresh ones, installed new drain pipes and I've been keeping busy and damn do I feel GOOD lately.

 I even organised a boardgame night last night with my stoner friends. They can always use my studio room to smoke, and now I could sit next to them, not smoking and not even longing for a smoke. This is the exact scenario I had in mind when I threw away my stash and said it is over. Not feeling the peer pressure and just enjoy the company of my friends. At the end of the night, no one almost knew what he was doing in the boardgame since they were just prety stoned, and now I could see how I looked the last 16 years when I was with company. I guess, in my experience, if you have a reason to stop smoking, then it's the first big step towards succes.

I tend to beat myself up for the things I did while high, but I’m curious what advice you guys have on this? 
Especially my relationship with my ex who was a good person & did care about me. I constantly have these thoughts of “maybe it woulda been working out now if you were not high and present to understand what was going on.” I’m having a hard time moving on with her now that I’m sobering up & can’t use weed to escape. It just sucks how I had to lose another person I considered special to me all because of my addiction to a plant. 
The other regrets include me not being more present for my family (parents, siblings, nephews & nieces), but I’ve improved in that and will continue to try to be a better family member everyday. But I still beat myself up for the time I wasted smoking weed instead of doing something productive/meaningful. I used to smoke whenever I beat myself up so I can be more “chill” on myself, but then end up beating myself up for relapsing which ends up in a feedback loop. I’m doing better now with a better mindset of no intentions of weed in my life .

I’ve been addicted to weed since I was 16, basically smoking everyday and I’m about to be 21 now. I started experiencing major depression and anxiety when I was 15 and I loved how weed would numb me. However, with all my problems and addiction I’ve felt like a full blown failure to my family. I am in university and am still maintaining mostly A’s and some B’s but I don’t want to be reliant on a drug, especially one that isn’t covered by insurance. 

I’ve tried quitting multiple times over the years and I’ve never been able to and it makes me feel awful because I tell my family I’m gonna stop and I NEVER can. My depression and suicidal thoughts have just been so much and I couldn’t bear them so I would always smoke. 

But as I said before, I’m simply tired of being reliant on a drug and majorly stressing out about stretching it out. I just wanna be okay and happy :/ At this point Id rather just take the pain of depression and suicidal thoughts over continuing to disappoint my family. I doubt I’d ever commit suicide because I just don’t have the balls to do that to my family, girlfriend and friends. They all support me so much and I always fail them. It’s an awful feeling 

Weed has fucked me up since I started young and have always used it as a crutch. I used to smoke street carts 24/7 when I was a dealer in high school. If I ran out I’d just simply open another one like it was a candy bar. I definitely have smoked hundreds of them. There’s no way to know but I think the street carts gave me epilepsy although I could be totally wrong. One day I suddenly started seizing and having seizures back to back to back to back although there is NO history of epilepsy in my family. 

Epilepsy has only worsened my depression and addiction because I beat myself up and feel awful when I have a seizure in front of someone cause I can’t even imagine how scary that is. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I honestly just feel so lost and trapped which is why I’m just on here venting. If you made it this far, that means a lot. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated. I honestly am just exhausted of life",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8802596}"

I decided that while weed was hard, I could still be a healthier person doing that than drinking everyday.

I CANT regulate... just something about it that makes me keep smoking. In maybe positive news, I've kicked drinking over the last month and started to lose some of the weight again. Now the hard part will be avoiding both. 

The last day or two has sucked and I've felt shitty but I assume it won't be quite as bad as last time since I only smoked for about a month this time vs ~10 years the time before.

I want to add a little to this community and I'm shocked to not find this before. So here is something to listen to while being sober! 

It's called ""little green bag"" by George Baker selection.

I'm sure you've heard it before because it's quite the popular song due to some movies using it but the text is spot on. 

""Lookin' back on the track for a little greenback
Got to find just the kind or I'm losin' my mind
Out of sight, in the night, out of sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track, gonna do it my way
Out of sight, in the night, out of sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track, gonna do it my way
Lookin' back

Lookin' for some happiness, but there is only loneliness to find""

Funny thing is, is that I listened to this song many times while high and I do remember listening to the song and thinking it was really funny. Now I don't think it's funny anymore and quite the emotional song in a weird way. 

Good luck to everybody!

Edit: I do know that the song was originally ment to be about the American dollar, that's why they sing greenback instead of green bag, but for some reason everybody accepted it as little green bag so the song was changed from little greenback to little green bag without changing the actual lyrics. Pretty funny story.

It's just so hard to actually make the first step and start a streak.

The past few weeks, I kept telling myself, ""okay, today is the first day I don't smoke any weed,"" but I get withdrawals like appetite problems, fogginess/fatigue, and insomnia, and those are always things that make me say, ""okay, I can't do it today. Maybe tomorrow.""

I always get insomnia after quitting weed. I wanted to quit on Monday, but then I would have had to be awake all night and then go through a full day of school and work while zonked out and sleep deprived.

But it's Friday, and I got nothing to do over the weekend except some homework.

I will not smoke today. I'll go through my whole day, and I know for certain that the insomnia will kick in tonight.

Mum is a heavy smoker, dad partakes in the evenings. Started at 18 through a then-girlfriend, bought a bong and have smoked wake & bake -> going to sleep on 2 consecutive heads for all the 6 years, with exactly one (1) month long break in all these.

About 2/3-ish years ago I subconsciously realized that I don't even get high and needed it to function, in my terms, ""normally"" - but quitting seemed so out of reach and I told myself ALL the excuses all the time ( I would lose my personality / I am made for weed smoking coming from my parents yada yada )

I was, and still am, pretty dissatisfied with my life, but any time I had any thought towards my situation, a head made me think ""Eh maybe its not all too bad anyways"" and I would keep myself in the same place.

Until last december where, with planning 2 days ahead, I decided at 3AM to take a hammer to all my 3 bongs and be done with it. Smashed em to pieces, threw any paraphernalia away and gave the rest of my stash to my mum. And since then, I basically had next to no cravings. I think seeing the ""light"" myself and deciding enough is enough was the key part in quitting. Previously I didn't really want to. This time I meant business. Throwing them away would've probably been easier, as I did step into a glass shard the morning after, but I think the act of destroying them really strengthened my standing. Hammer in hand afterwards felt like such a relief. I even skipped the new years eve party in order to not get tempted to smoke, and just stayed at home playing FFXIV.

First week was total pride filled euphoria, despite major sleep issues. The crazy dreams kind of helped though, really enjoyed those. Week 2 to 5/6 were absolute hell. Depression hit me with the full force, intrusive thoughts about me absolutely sucking and having wasted 6 years non-stop. No cravings still, because I was aware that I am just adjusting to new life. My mantra was ""Die Milch ist vergossen"" aka the milk is already spilled. I can't change the past 6 years so I'll just forget about it.

All I did in those 6 years was part-time retail work to afford the habit, and 2 go's at university which I really didn't take all too serious so I dropped out of both 1 semester in. Without weed I realized how much I despise retail working, so me being laid off a week and a half ago kind of helps with the whole doing a 180 on my life.

Life is still a tad bit less joyous ever since, but the main difference is that **_I am not running away from those reasons anymore. I can see why exactly my life is in the place it is, and I am much more motivated to take steps towards changing that - I can actually be proud of any increment I am doing because I know its a) for the better and b) I'm not a fucking drug addict anymore_**

There is **SO MUCH LESS GUILT ON ME.** No more (1) night sweats, which I used to get ALL THE TIME while smoking. No more (2) coughing and big glops of almost black goo. No more (3) having my friends wait on me every fucking hour / hour and a half to queue or do anything in games. No more (4) arguing with myself about whether I should quit and if that's the reason my life sucks. No more (5) exorbitant amounts of my paychecks going up in smoke. No more (6) insecurities about sounding dumb. Friends have commented that my brain seems to be firing on more cylinders and my speech having improved. No more (7) stinking up my room and having ash everywhere because I spill it cleaning the head. No more (8) skipping brushing teeth because I didn't wanna waste any minute of prime-high time after the bonghit to get me to sleep. No more (9) meaningless sleep that doesn't help me process shit, dreams are amazing! I really missed those. No more (10) fake happiness and complacency that trumps everything that is not just going home and blasting myself. No more (11) being dependent on smoking before anything I did. I used to come home from work with food in my bag. But ALWAYS took my 30-45 minutes smoking a bowl / drinking a coffee before starting to eat, making my food cold.

I could go on and list more positives, but I feel like it'll end up being too long. The main gist is, I feel so much more free. I am not bound by the weed anymore. I feel like I can take on anything I want to with enough work and dedication, as the biggest step in discipline has been done.

I'm a bit nervous to post about this. This post will probably be all over the place because I don't even know where to start. I'm not good with writing things out like this.

I feel like I've hidden this side of me from many people. Only a few in my life know how bad I struggle with marijuana. One thing is too I actually have a condition called Cannibas Hyperemsis Syndrome. Youd think I'd be able to stop with having this condition but I have been struggling mentally with it. Marijuana has said to be my escape. Instead of having a drink, I smoke. I've talked to counselors and this is what they've even said.

Back in 2018 I did quit smoking for 3 months before I relapsed. I was admitted to hospital for nutritional monitoring because I was down to 78 Ibs due to all the sickness, so it was a lot easier to quit. I had no choice, they wouldn't even let me outside. I relapsed because I had an Irritable Bowel Syndrome attack and thought that smoking in moderation would help with that. 

I felt GREAT overall through the 3 months, had a few episodes where I was nauseous and vomiting but I also have Gastroparesis which causes stomach issues. 

I smoke poppers too so that harshness on my stomach has been a double wammy. I smoke daily, probably 20-30 poppers a day. I wake up in the morning and smoke, wake up middle of the night  I smoke, all day I smoke. I'm sick daily and I beat myself up for it. I think if I couldn't eat dairy or gluten I wouldn't with no problem but even having CHS hasn't stopped me. I feel I'm so use to being sick that I just deal now. 

I started smoking in 2010 for anxiety and depression and it just got worse from there. I wasn't diagnosed with the CHS until my hospital admitting in 2018 when we realized that's what was going on. They actually misdiagnosed me for almost 6 years and had me on medications to treat. No longer on those.

I'm ready to quit again and this is day 1 for me. I know I'm going to end up in a huge vomiting episode as this has happened before and why I always end up smoking again. I already feel my stomach turning and no appetite. Palms are sweating like crazy. I haven't smoked since last night. It's been alnosy 12 hours. This time I'm DONE with the marijuana and feeling like shit everyday. I honestly can't do it anymore. I'm weak, exhausted, body pains all the time, missing out on life.

Physical withdrawals have almost entirely gone away and my head feels incredibly clear in a way I forgot it could.

But, life is just so bland now. It's not been bad. I'm binging a new TV show (Succession) and reading a new book series (First Law trilogy) and it's been enjoyable, but nothing compared to the highs of, well, being high.

Part of my problem I think is I did these activities stoned all of the time before, so it still feels like something's missing I guess. But to be honest when I'm watching the show or reading my book I'm totally immersed and not really thinking about weed, I just know it's not the same levels of enjoyment I got from smoking.

I know I should be exercising more, but I'm recovering from a broken foot which limits how much I can do, though I am still doing upper body workouts at least.

I saw someone else here yesterday mention in another thread the maxim ""If you're bored, you're boring"" and I'm worried about that applying to me, but I'm not really sure what else I could be doing.

Work has been extra busy lately and I have some home projects that need to get done ASAP, neither of which I particularly enjoy working on which I think is contributing to my lack of enjoyment as they take up so much of my time.

Anyway, just kinda putting my thoughts down into words. I'm hoping this blah feeling is more related to it being early days rather than a symptom of a boring life, but I really hope I find something soon that matches the feeling weed would give me.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44858938}"

Ugh I want to smoke so fking bad. Like many others it started out really good and I thought weed was a cure all and that’s what I was missing in life. Then my anxiety started getting worse so I’ve been on and off trying to quit for the last year. 

I quit for a while when I started anxiety medication, was doing good for about a month then I got a full time job. Got sucked back into it and figured “it’s fine I can just do it on weekends” wasn’t that a fking mistake. Wasn’t long before I started doing it on weekdays. Thankfully I caught it early and stopped but now I just want it so much more. I’m having such a hard time coping with working full time and I just want to smoke. It doesn’t help that I become super productive while high. In fact lately when I get high I feel I must be experiencing mania because I’ll clean for hours. I literally was scrubbing the grit in my bathroom a week ago with a toothbrush when I was high off. My mom is an alcoholic and while the addiction presents itself in wildly different ways, I still find myself seeing similarities in our addiction. Fking sucks.

Im still on anxiety medication which I feel is helping a lot, but this shit is hard. It’s like whenever I do smoke I’m literally just lik “fk it I don’t care. I want it and Can moderate and will be fine” like I don’t even care and end up doing it. I want to be strong and not want to do it but sadly a big part of me does and will make enough excuses to do so. And it’s always fun at first. Then I just spiral.

It’s my second day sober and while I feel better than yesterday, I’m still bummed and really want to smoke. I even almost considered having a drink as a replacement.

I was a heavy chronic weed user. 9 years. I quit once many years ago for 3 months, never had symptoms like I do now. I was a heavy weed smoker. I smoked blunts, joints. Slowly upped it to dabbing and vaping because the other shit wasnt working. Then it was tinctures because I could count how many MG I was eating with each serving. In the end, I knew I had reached a point that I needed to quit. Not just like a break to give myself a tolerance break. I needed to really quit.

I put down the pend and havnt smoking anything since. I started with some anxiety and stress. Sleepless nights. YOu know the deal. But it got worse after my mistake. About 12 days later, I was traveling and really tired. I got an edible to sleep. I had some crazy paranoia and anxiety since then. I havnt touched anything else since, so im about 15 days clean. I have extreme stress, the anxiety is through the roof, the shortness of breath feeling is the worst, and im paranoid as fuck. I know this is all in my head. I know that because I reached out to a therapist to talk about what is on my mind. Its gonna take a good month before this clears out of my system. I go to the gym regularly. I run hard to clear my mind. But this shortness of breath is killing me. Or the feeling of shortness of breath.

Now im here to share my experience. I hope if you or anyone else has symptoms, im right there with you and we got this.

When the pandemic started, I was locked in my apartment for more or less a year and a half until I got vaccinated and the infections started to subside a bit during late summer-early autumn, you all know the story. 

Now when the Omicron is spreading the way that it is, and I am off weed, I cannot function anymore. At all. It's pretty much like how it was at the beginning of this whole pandemic for me. Can't go outside, can't shake hands with people without getting bad anxiety about a) Am I going to get the rona and kick it? and b) Why is this person looking so intently at me? Did I do something?! THEY HATE ME!

I can't go to my psychiatrist, because the chance of getting infected is too great, and I can barely meet family members. If I make sure both I and my family have been isolated for a week at least. The thought of infecting someone is probably worse than me getting infected. 

I am not trying to rationalize going back to smoking in order to not feel a constant fear of dying or killing someone, but I don't know what to do. I can't live like this. It has gotten to the point that if I buy a case of soda or a chocolate bar I \*literally\* wash all cans with soap, hot water, and chlorine. That all went away when I was smoking daily and it was a huge relief. 

Do any of you have any tips in order to make my life better whilst simultaneously avoiding all forms of weed?

I feel immensely guilty. When I found his body I sobbed for an hour until my husband got me some weed and of course I also poured a glass of wine (I have a very addictive personality). Later that day when we performed his funeral at a local lake I realized what had happened, that through my haze and complacency I failed him.

I don't know why, I just wanted to one night and the impulse got the better of me, even though I didn't miss it, I just wanted one chill night that has now turned into 2 months of every day use.

 I tried to quit cold turkey again, and it was the worst experience of my life. I couldn't eat, sleep, I had cold sweats, shaking , dizziness, diarrhea, and eventually I started puking my guts up until I was just dry heaving, and fell asleep from the tiring onslaught. I spent a whole day smoking after that, because I felt amazing by comparison and I was terrified to feel that bad again.

I'm trying to slowing wean myself off now, but not being in work means I'm home all day, no distractions and nothing stopping me from using. I am burning money I don't have, I'm starting to feel bad every day no matter if I smoke or not, and I just can't do it. 

I really need some help, support and advice. I don't know why withdrawing was so much worse this time. I think I might be able to limit it to evening use and wean myself off that way or just have 1 little bong a day until I can stop. What do you all think?

If you’re anything like me, you probably remember it more clearly than yesterday, or what you had for lunch. That moment, or if you’re paying attention moments, that fill you up with thoughts and words to the point of speechlessness. That clawing, aw-ing feeling – that great, inexpressible !WOW! It’s like you’ve taken a step back and realised that everything’s been in harmony all along, you’re at the middle of everything making sense. You just haven’t been paying attention. 

You finally get the joke – you laugh at yourself, as you look at the people around you. *OF COURSE!!* And everyone stares back at you, laughing at your sudden awareness – we are all in the centre of the joke, the joke that everything does make sense, if we stop trying to explain it all away. For most of us, it’s just a fleeting moment of indefinable total meaningfulness. All of time and space collapsing upon itself into its forever grandeur, just to kiss your tiny life and let you in on the secret. 

For me one of those moments is new years, 2010. In the great tradition of festivals, our friendship group had scattered, we were all off on our own adventures. I felt always surrounded by people, always alone looking restlessly for my friends – my tribe within a tribe. Not lost, not found. All night just searching. Until I was finally at peace, wandering around in the moon light, drifting through the trees. Becoming comfortable with just being with in my own shell, and maybe never finding my friends again, or my campsite, or daylight, again – whatever those concepts meant. 

At some point, I was drawn into a clearing in the forest. Within and yet adjacent to the festival. Just slightly off the paths enough that you could only really arrive there if you weren’t trying to get there. A nothing place that hides in plain sight on any map. I was drawn by the clearing because of how beautiful the moon was. Without the clutter of people and tents and activities, even trees, to cloud my view, I had the whole SKY to myself. As I wondered deeper into the openness, I walked slower. As the sky got bigger, I got smaller. I kept approaching nothing in particular, and yet here it finally was – everything and always. It was all here. How had I not noticed this before? 

Approaching the centre of this nothingness-everything, a mix of shadows eventually made way for a human silhouette. Someone had beaten me to the best vantage spot on the planet, and I was going to be able to share. As if the universe had not provided me enough already, I was also blessed with a kindred spirit – were they the host and I their guest? Were they now in my strange lair, and I host? This stranger and I were meant to be here. Had we always been here, alone-together, amidst all of everything? It seemed implausible it could have ever been otherwise. 

As I finally neared them, walking softer, slower, I dared to broach the silence with a greeting, no matter how much I may belittle this beautiful stranger’s repose. “Nice spot for it” I offered, admiringly – knowingly. A self-evident truth if ever there were one. Four words have rarely held such tautology. This was THE spot for it – for it all. 

“It sure is” my friend offered, just as unnecessarily. As we both awoke to ourselves, finding eachother again in this place – the only place we could have ever been. Of course we were both here, we were concertedly not at every other place and time. All of those moments spent looking for eachother, wondering alone, only to be found here. OF COURSE!! We spent a long while basking in the cosmic joke, on the divine lunar viewing platform that we had found, that was always waiting to be found. When we finally got ourselves and stopped looking for anything, we stumbled across everything. The great cosmic joke – it was us, it was me, it was here all along. 

Friend, if you’ve made it this far (in this post; in your journey), I hope it’s because somehow, in this subreddit, you’ve found something like this feeling. I have heard my words, emotions and experiences echoed in every post I read. People like me - people that are me. Just searching for a way to solve themselves, if only someone would give them the tools. 

Weed was never the answer I thought it was, or that I wanted it to be. It’s just a plant, after all. In the end, all the drugs can do is cover up their own inability to offer transcendence - whatever that means. 

Reading these posts, I’m reminded of that moment when I thought I was lost from the life I wanted, and accidentally found all of existence - for a second at least. I am reminded how I can’t enjoy my small moment with eternity if my hands, mind and heart are full of what I already know. And for me, I’ve chosen weed to be the answer to everything. 

I am tired of answering everything asked of me with another toke. Let go, stoner. You’ve found your people again here, on this digital lunar viewing platform. You have been waiting here all along for me to work this out and stop searching. I thought I was trying to quit weed, when really I was looking for an excuse to let go. I’ve already learnt a lot of the hard lessons through the depths of my addiction. I thought my sorrow and my brokenness were the problems, when really they hold a lot of the solution by just being a mirror – is this really what I want to be???

If you haven’t had this feeling, listen to yourself a little bit more. What is it about the experiences here that don’t offer truth for you? How are you different? I feel if you – and if I – can faithfully answer those questions, sobriety can start to sort itself out. Are you the shadow or the light? 

The sky is not as clear tonight, I’m not as young. I have a life cluttered with commitments now. Plenty to tend and attend to. Sitting up too late, at the beginning of this stranger decade, at the start of this other new year, I remember the cosmic joke, and how I stopped laughing along at some point. The joke’s been there all along, that eternal moment has always been present, even when I’ve chosen to hide myself from it. I smile, I cry. I laugh at how every word on my screen drips with knowing they can’t betray or explain the something beyond everything. OF COURSE.

Second week, which im currently in, is much more about psychological symptoms. Sometimes I feel like shit for a moment and i can put my finger on why, so that’s anxiety for me. Also the temptation to relapse just to « feel better » is much more present theses days then ever.

It makes you want to feel less because some emotions are too intense or suck and weed functions as an escape from these emotions. I decided that I needed to fully experience these emotions and allow myself to feel the sadness. I mean, that's what makes us human. The fact that we feel these emotions even if some of them do suck. If we didn't have these experiences, it would make life mundane. I was able to get over it and worked out to get my head clear.

It just got to the point where it was too obvious that this has become a mess. The cognitive effects are apparent and I need my brain back. Weed is expensive and I need my bank account back! I want to have dreams again and feel peppy in the morning. There is just no reason for me to be using now. 

Day 1 was ok. I decided to avoid alcohol too for the time being just to have a clearer picture of who I actually am. Having lots of anxiety and generally just feeling super keyed up. I did a really intense workout and ran my pup to try to get some of the pent up energy out, and that helped. But I know this won't be easy. I've ""window shopped"" a few times today for a cart (my brain told me that maybe a ""lighter"" strain would be ok! Ugh) but I didn't give in. Feeling a little obsessive about it, though. Really annoying.

Some thoughts and reflections…,"Hi friends, today I celebrate an entire month sober from weed! This is the longest I have been sober in a year and I am proud of myself for making it this far. Thank you to everyone on r/leaves for your support, I could never have made it this far without your support and encouragement. 

I wanted to share a few thoughts and reflections on my journey so far: 

- I didn’t realize how much I normalized abusing weed until I quit. In hindsight, I am absolutely baffled at how I just accepted things like daily hangovers, a shit diet, low energy levels, cutting out time with family/friends to get high, and craving weed whenever I was not stoned. I honestly don’t miss that lifestyle and I am good with never returning to it.

- Time has slowed down SO MUCH. In the last year I would catch myself saying “where has the time gone?” nearly nonstop. I thought it was just growing older, but it really was the weed. January is the slowest month I’ve experienced since I started using weed during lockdown, and I feel like I’m truly living life instead of watching it float by.

- My physical health has noticeably improved. Just this month I’ve lost over 10lbs, started eating healthier food instead of stoner junk food, and been more physically active than I have been in months. Also, the sleep is amazing and I wake up feeling refreshed every morning!

- I still struggle with managing my emotions at times, and I plan to set up an appointment with my therapist in the next couple of weeks. Sometimes I feel incredibly anxious for no reason - I think part of it has to do with the fact I had a psychotic episode while stoned a couple months ago. For the most part the anxiety/emotions are not debilitating like they were the first two weeks of sobriety, but they have persisted long enough for me to want professional help. 

- I am definitely going through a quarter life crisis at this point. Between COVID and regularly getting stoned for the last two years, I have been incredibly out of touch with myself and I barely know the person I am becoming. My personality, interests, values, and concept of self are rapidly changing and it can be a little terrifying to work through at times. I just try to take a deep breath, remind myself that I’ve been through worse, and view my self-discovery as a journey that will never truly end.

I’m very new to reddit, but I already like this here subreddit.

I’ve been smoking since 12 years, but I’ve been smoking daily since 5-6 years (hard to remember exactly). Recently I got a moderna booster vaccine against COVID, and after the ‘normal’ symptoms, around the third day last friday, I got a scary wake up call.

I was playing games with an online friend, and I felt a weird thing in my body. Cold hands, sweat, a feeling of sweaty heat through out the body, a veil over the eyes … I was fainting. Now fainting as such is not uncommon, many of you might know the feeling, but I’ve never felt something like that. I will admit that I got really scared, like I was literally dying. At first I thought it had to do with the vaccine. 

Since that friday I have been feeling weird, light headed, and my blood pressure didn’t seem to get back to normal. I decided to stop smoking for a while. Now this sunday, I felt better so I smoked a joint in the evening. Almost directly after that I got an oppressive feeling in my chest, and it was hard to breath. I went to the ER thinking I was really on the verge of death again.

But I had nothing. My heart rate and blood pressure where optimal and my blood test was, and I quote a doctor, an example of a healthy adult (thats positive at least). So what I really had was a panic attack. 

Since that realization dawned on me I decided to act. If weed can have that effect on me I don’t really want to partake in it anymore. Having red a lot of all your stories I recognize a lot of my woes as being symptoms of withdrawal … and I cant say I’m happy on the way it happened but I think that this will really motivate me to really stop.

I’m on my third day without a joint, and I already dream very vividly (i really should share those dreams on a dedicated subreddit). I’m looking forward to read more of your stories and maybe sharing my own advancements.

He leaves barely smoked joints everywhere and in my low moments I smoke them. He will walk up to me and hand me a joint (or three) when he sees I'm stressed. I take it ofcourse and smoke and feel like garbage and then after ask him please stop rolling for me that my mental health is deteriorating from smoking. We will be having a rough patch and he will go smoke and come right in and try to kiss me smelling like smoke and I just want to cry. He will leave the papers grinder etc on the kitchen table in plain sight... Calling to me to come over and roll juuuust a small one. I'm the one expected to purchase it for him when I do the grocery shopping. He will try for a few days to be supportive then start slipping up again.

I can see he feels attacked in my conversation asking him for more support (he knows how he is affecting me and it makes him upset and he can't handle it so he turns those emotions on me). I've just given up because the backlash from him just isn't worth it. I don't know if it's even fair to be asking this of him and I need to somehow be stronger. But I'm fucking weak. 

Divorce is not an option and I don't know what else I can do my self control is so poor but I feel like, scarily, life isn't worth living and a big part of that is my relationship with smoking. I desperately need to stop but feel like I can't get away from it.

The past three nights I have been waking up in a puddle of sweat, can barely sleep and no appetite whatsoever plus weakness (like I gotta sit down to take a shower). Emotionally I feel RAW and very vulnerable.. like as if every emotion from the past four years are just now being felt and processed. But I have also been noticing a few positive things.. for one I think my senses are becoming a bit more intense, I feel more passionate about things and I feel more interested in starting new hobbies since all I’ve been doing the last four years is get high and be couch-locked. I realize how stressful it was to always make sure I had enough weed, the guilt from hiding how much I use from those close to me. I lied to everyone I know about how often I would be high, how much money I spend on it, and really that isolated me. I i’ve lost so many friends because all I ever wanna do is sit at home and get high. When I hang out with friends, if we aren’t getting high together I would always try to come up with excuse to go home just so I could smoke as much as I want. It was the only thing that made me happy, it was the first thing on my mind when I wake up and the last thing on my mind before I fall asleep. Now that it’s gone, i’m left to question who am I without weed? It’s like I’m meeting myself for the first time. I know I still have a long way to go but I’m proud this is the longest I’ve been completely sober in years. The biggest reason why I never attempted to quit Before was because I thought I would be excruciatingly bored without it, which hasn’t been a problem so far but I am afraid but that will become an issue someday soon. As someone who has battled depression for most of their life, when I first started smoking weed regularly I had fun doing the most mundane tasks and I felt like it was literally a lifesaver.

After I noticed one day ""dude, why am I actually smoking right now?"" I decided it was time for a t-break.

2 weeks later I decided to pick up weed again. Smoked for two weeks. 0.1-0.3g. I smoke out of pipes and the Weed I use is a hybrid with 20%Thc give or take.
Since it really doesn't seem to be that good for me I wanted to quit again 3 days ago.

The dillemma I'm having is, that I suffer from an eating disorder, where I really have to struggle to eat enough calories a day. No Anorexia, just no appetite.
I also have real trouble falling asleep because of my (diagnosed) anxiety and depression (all things also present before I started smoking weed for the first time if you are wondering).

Obviously weed helps mask these symptoms a lot for me.

And today, it is only my 26th day without THC. But I don’t feel the need for it anymore.  It is like I got tired of it after so many years of abuse.  I made a promise to myself that IF I use cannabis again, it won’t be more than once a year.

I got a bit of high blood pressure and chest pain for quitting abruptly.  I’ve been followed by my doctor and those symptoms finally disappeared after 2-3 weeks.

I always worked all my life and been functional with cannabis.  I worked as an IT technician and recently got promoted as a server administrator and now I focus entirely on that and try to be better everyday.

Let me spin you a tale of the last 48 hours of my life and how I did not allow myself to fall back on old habits/bad coping mechanisms. 

Monday, I’m at work. All is well until I get 5 emails back to back about somebody opening a checking account using my email address (it’s my first and last name, so it’s no accident) at Wells Fargo. Well, if you don’t know, Wells Fargo is a trash trash trash bank that I would never bank with. I had to call them, my own bank, all credit bureaus, the works. So, suffice to say, it was a shit day. 

Today rolls around. I’m up at my normal time, on my way to work when my tire light comes on. I think, “Huh, that’s weird. These tires are two weeks old. I’ll just stop at a GetGo and fill it back up when I get off later.” Not as soon as I thought that, my back end started to swing. I had ran over a nail on my two week old brand new tire. I pull off and call AAA as it’s snowing and I’m not trying to freeze here. They get there an hour later, change it to my donut with no worries. 3 TIRE SHOPS AND 7 HOURS LATER my tire is replaced because the inside is just shredded to pieces. 

Do you wanna know the best part? I did not let myself cave and smoke. I persevered through probably the most stressful time since I quit smoking.

Of course the pandemic made things a little bit worse, but I’d probably still be in this situation regardless. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

While this idea of quitting/cutting back on my marijuana consumption has been a topic of thought for at least a year/year and a half now, it’s especially been one the past week or so. 

I miss being able to find joy in simple things of every day. This of course has been taken over by my need to smoke either at all times, or before every thing I do. I’d like to think smoking helped at first.. I’m an anxious person, and more shy + introverted, but smoking helped me relax and open up. As of lately though I often find myself feeling more disconnected and now being hyper aware of such. 

Anyway, something sparked in me today, and I feel like quitting TOMORROW. Though ideas like this always juggle in my mind, I wake up the next day and don’t hold to it. I’ve never quite sat down and put as much thought, let alone wrote something out before, but I feel like starting my journey to sobriety. 

Does anyone have any tips - specifically on how to stay as mindful and present as much as you can? I’ve “tried” quitting before, but find myself bored, and making excuses to smoke again and relieve that feeling of boredom. 
I also find accountability is really helpful. Any other first day quitters looking to check in daily, even just counting along the days to infinity?

I have, with the help of my psychiatrist, weaned off of it before, but that has proven to be a bad idea. But I desperately want to cry and let this stuff out, but I am just not able.

This happened after smoking for 25 years on the daily. I'll be 42 at the end of this month. Didn't think I'd ever want or be able to break free, but I'm glad I have. Alcohol was also part of my addiction portfolio, up until 4 years ago.

Getting high, drunk, or what have you, causes an unnatural state of the mind. Sometimes what it causes can feel overwhelmingly amazing, awesome and other positive descriptors. It's a state of mind unattainable any other way. It's a tough (but not impossible) thing to walk away from so congratulate yourself if you have and keep working on it if you haven't.

That said once you stop there is a void that must be filled. I had to find deeper purpose in my life, new meaning, and reaching for new goals and pushing myself harder than I had in the past. It's hard to not think back and remember those feelings and wish you could experience that again. It makes sense, why would you not want to? Through my experienced I had feelings of my situation being unfair - why did I have to end up like this when there are others who seemingly can control it and use in moderation? I guess that kind of is unfair really, a lot of things in life are not fair we just have to deal with and accept it.

Once I got some clean time behind me a couple of things began to happen. Number one it became easier to live without weed or booze. My brain stopped expecting it and I was able to get on with life. Things improved and most aspects of my life got better. Some things only marginally improved while others were more significant. Number two while the temptation for weed is far less so is the memory of all the negative it caused and the fact that *I cannot control it, no matter how remote a possibility having a problem with it again seems.* The occasional temptation will probably never go away completely, this is a reality a former addict must have and learn to deal with. Knowing the bliss one can obtain from their previous drug of choice certainly would trigger this kind of thought. Its normal and natural to have those.

My recovery from weed addition is based on a clearly defined boundary. That boundary is that I don't use weed. Period. From past experience I know with a high degree of certainty that consuming any amount of weed, in anyway will gradually lead back to where I was when it was such a problem that I had to go through the struggle of quitting altogether. Again, back to the unfairness factor. Using weed once will literally have almost no negative consequence in my life and would actually probably provide me with some degree of relaxation, euphoria and relaxation. My logic has to be stronger though because my logic tells me, based on past experience, a single use will inevitably lead to daily use which **does** have negative consequences in my life.

I'm happy to be where I am. Life is an interesting thing and there are a lot of opportunities to explore and learn new things, I enjoy doing that. I like the people in my life, I like to watch my relationships change and grow, be present with my children and try to do well in my career.

A dear friend of mine felt awful and dropped off a care package of food, movies, and books... and a vape pen.

He wasn't trying to get me hooked and I hadn't seen this friend in awhile, otherwise I would have told him ""no thanks"".  Being in the basement for a week, alone, drove me nuts.  I caved.  I puffed at the vape pen.  70% THC oil.  I did it for a few days.

It was great.

2022-01-25 08:49:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sce654/start_quitting_weed/,Start quitting weed!,"Hey I'm 25 male from Germany, smoking weed since I was 14.

The biggest thing that prevented me from not smoking in a daily manner was the fear of loosing my driver license. Then the pandemic started and I worked since then 100% from my home office. So this fear was taken, and it began...

Since then, I think it's almost two years, my weed consumption is going over the roof. I smoke every day, on working days in the evening, and on weekends it's going insane.

Long time I saw no problems with weed, I'm doing my work In a good way and nobody ever said something bad that could be related to the abuse. 

But I would say a few years ago I figured out that my brain is getting slow, remember things is really a problem. Sometimes I'm really sure about a memory in my head, that it happened like this, but it is completely wrong or never happened.

I often started to try quitting weed or doing a ""break"" and the thing is I feel really fantastic when I quit. After a few days or a week, I'm getting a sort of energy in my mind and body, I really start doing things I like, and I would never start if I'm high. So it feels very good after successfully quitting a few days, but the first week is not that good.

The hardest thing is that I can't sleep without weed, even if I'm completely tired and lots of hours awake. That's one of the biggest reasons why I fail to quit, with weed I have the best sleep and I fall asleep blazing fast. The problem is this sleep is not way not that refreshing than without it. 

Another thing is my circle of friends nearly entirely consists of potheads, even some colleagues in my work are smoking frequently. I have no problem which potheads haha, I like them, but It's hard to quit if your every day surrounded with the topic. And of course the German state is trying to legalize it, a thing that I wanted my whole life, doesn't make things easier.

But all these things are just in my mind, because my brain cant remember how are these things without weed, and I really want to know how it is.

So yeah I failed since the last year many many times, the biggest score was 8 days not smoking, than I got sick. And feeling sick is not nice, and you quickly got bored and this leads to get weak and smoke again...

My good New Year's resolution was to quit weed on the 01.01.22, I'm a bit late, but I also found this Subreddit, with so many cool stories from people that are much longer addicted than me.

So I thought every time I'm feeling weak again or want to smoke for no matter reason, I come here and will read some stories. And I'm starting this by committing my own :)

Yesterday was my first day without smoking, I'm feeling good and will definitely continue.

On top of that I love getting high when I do other things I love doing. It’s like just the super saiyan version of it.

For instance, I’ve loved video games since I was a kid and so, when I got high and played, it felt like I was in the video game. Would just play red dead redemption 2 hunting all day like I had a life in it. Don’t get me started in gta. Then when ghost of Tsushima came out. I kept getting high living out my ninja/samurai fantasies 

Another was sex/jerking off (mostly the latter since me and my girlfriend broke up which weed also ended for me on top of their things ofc) the orgasm you get during this is insane but my girlfriend hated me when I was high and we would have sex since I’d just have this glazed look in my eyes but the sex was worth it for me so I didn’t even notice during my euphoria.

Now when quitting, trying to do these things is hard since I’ve felt them on a higher level it’s hard to enjoy when grounded

Don’t get me wrong, I still have an active life on top of things but I’ve always been a high functioning stoner. But since me and my girlfriend broke up I’ve let myself go. I used to be pretty built due to my ice hockey days but now I’m more like Garfield. Going to the gym tomorrow after so long gonna be a bitch.

Your body has an endocannabinoid system. Yeah, we produce our own cannabis! We do this as a reward as part of our reward system. These cannabinoids are not harmful and contribute to many vital functions. When you go for a run, you may get or have heard of ""runners high"". Cannabinoids are only harmful when we are ingesting them, because we are simply not really supposed to have that many cannabinoids in a healthy body. 

Gard physical labour and vigorous exercise activate this system. If you get your heart pumping for 30 min with strenuous work or physical exercise I can guarantee if you have done it correctly, you will activate your endocannabinoids. 

After putting in hard work to do this a few times, I can guarantee you will have a new, healthy way to get that fix you love. 

Why smoke harmful shit when you can help your body out and get the same result?

Talking to my friends and family, I keep hearing the same thing. You need to *want* to quit. And I know this is true, and it's what makes this so hard. I know deep down, logically, that quitting weed long term would provide a lot of benefits. But the addicted part of me loves to get high, I love the release and I love being able to just lose the world for a bit. 

I just don't *want* to quit right now. But I've made promises to family/friends and myself that I am doing it. I ruined a relationship recently due to not being able to quit weed and even that doesn't give me the necessary drive to quit.

**I am your mind**  
Within you is a never-ending magnitude of Infinite strength, wisdom, and will

You abuse me  
By never letting me say and do as I feel

We argue like two enemies  
Yet we are good friends

Now there are moments when we harmonize with each other  
And become one with nature and reality *Tell me something to make me feel better*

But these times are few

When after you have replenished yourself  
The fear of the truth sets in  
We split, and you start to run again  
Running, running, running...  
Running through women, men, jobs, people, and life, looking for the answer  
When I had it all along  
But I smile because *I am your mind*

I was your mind *yesterday*  
I am your mind *today*  
And I’ll be your mind *tomorrow*  
And as our end draws near  
We will become closer  
But you and I?  
You and I, We will never be one  
For I’ll part form you  
And you will part from me  
You finding another mind  
And I another soul  
We will travel on and on  


By the way

I need *more* than sex to nourish my equilibrium  
But I do need sex.  
I also need sun, trees, stars, creativity and love  
But you saturate my soul with too much of one and not enough of the other

Therefore I cry.

But why do we cry?

But, the benefits I see in myself are so worth it. Slowly the fog is being lifted, my mind is actually working. I no longer stumble all day and forget everything but rather I am sharp and articulate, and truly live in the moment with my family and friends, who have helped me tremendously. I will say, the thought of being the best I can be for my wife and son has aided in this sobreity journey greatly and I think that's something some of you should think about, doing this for the others around you and not just yourself.

I’ve been accepting pats on the back since even though I know I just replaced my bottle of wine a night with non-stop cannabis vaping.

I’ve been vaping THC and ignoring the signs of addiction ever since. I know the signs, I can see them much easier after I had to identify them to quit drinking, but it’s easier to ignore them, too. Also, I couldn’t think of a reason to stop. I wasn’t smoking before/at work and I live in California so people are generally cool about it here.

My best friend, my dog, died on the morning of December 26th. He passed in my arms and the moment I felt him float away was the moment I lost the strongest motivating force in my life for the past 11 years.

I quit drinking to better take care of him. I found a therapist to work on my demons so that I wouldn’t live in fear and make his life more uncomfortable. Every positive step I’ve taken over the past decade was in service to the little guy.

Needless to say, I’ve spent the last month heavily self-medicating with weed. I smoked every time I didn’t want to feel pain. I even kept it from my therapist because I knew she would suggest taking a break and that was the last thing I wanted.

I bought a full gram cartridge on Thursday and today I realized half of it was gone. I had smoked what would usually take me at least a week and a half to smoke in 4 days. 

I thought, “Okay, little buddy. I’m gonna need you to motivate me one more time. Help me hit the brakes so I can take care of myself. I’ll do it for you this one last time.”

So here I am, currently reading stories and sharing mine to pass the time without smoking. 

I’m scared, but right now I have no plans. I’m trying sober life hour by hour until I can get to day by day, month by month, and so on.

Over time, the positive relationships I was building, the new hobbies and interests I was cultivating, the better work I was doing, the improved sleep I was having, the greater positivity I was feeling….all drifted back into the background again. 

This time, because I was paying attention to the relapse, I find it a helpful experience to reflect on, rather than being guilty about it. I remember how good I was doing, and how great I felt before – and how SHIT(!!!) I felt during the relapse. Part of the reason I smoked heavier and heavier was so that I didn’t notice how much I didn’t enjoy the ‘high’ anymore. 

So if you've done the same, or deciding to do the same - I see yah. I feel yah. Just remember it's a choice.

One hand on the steering wheel, Sam turned towards me and shook his head. “Give it another ten minutes.” 

Anxiously tapping my finger against the glove box, I waited. A small tupperware was in my lap, which held remnants of the brownie Sam and I split earlier. It tasted foul, and a half hour later, I was still sober. 

“How will I know it’s working?” I asked.
 
“You’ll see.” 

Sam was right. Weed is the mildest of drugs, but my first time getting high, it didn’t feel that way. The brownie hit me all at once. I turned up the volume of the music: the bass rocked through Sam’s truck. I started laughing. 

Sam smiled. “What’s so funny?”

I couldn’t get the grin off my face. “Nothing. How long have we been driving for?” I genuinely had no idea. 

As an angsty fifteen year old kid, the edible erased all my problems for a moment: Sam’s music sounded incredible, everything was funny, and I suddenly had the thoughts of a legendary philosopher rather than a C-student. 

It was a great first experience with weed, as were the times that followed. That high school kid never would predict that seven years later, he’d quit for good. 

Growing up, I didn't hesitate to drink, do drugs, or try anything else that could get me in trouble. As a shy teenager, I was my funniest, happiest, and most confident when I wasn’t sober. So, how did I reach this breaking point? How did I go from a stoner to deciding the drug can’t have a place in my life? It started with the virus that shall not be named. 

**The Bad Cure for Boredom**

What followed my first high experience were many similar ones throughout high school. My smoking habit was always under control. I never bought weed or got high on weekdays: partly because of the logistics of hiding it in the house, and due to the fact that I was taking school more seriously by the time I was a junior. 

If someone asked if I liked to smoke, I’d say “yeah”. If someone offered me weed at a party, I’d happily oblige. When my brother came home from college, he’d share a joint with me in our hot tub after our parents were asleep. But it wasn’t a big part of my life. 
It all changed my sophomore year of college. Out of the dorms, I shared an apartment with two friends and we had the freedom to do whatever we wanted. When the semester began, we split an ounce between the three of us. The first of many. With that, the daily habit of getting high was underway. 

In the midst of the pandemic, classes were online. Bars were closed and our college was enforced with strict rules on parties. As a whole, the social scene suffered, and I used getting high as a replacement for fun nights out. 

We’d wake up, get our online schoolwork done, and smoke. Day after day. It didn’t take long for the weeks to blend together. 
Time was spent ripping the bong, watching cartoons, and scrolling through DoorDash to happily pay $12 delivery fees. 

One year later, I don’t remember much of this semester. Every night was spent in the same stoned haze. My desire to socialize and study plummeted. Getting high, eating food, and watching TV was enough. 

That semester sucked. And although I cut down on my smoking to a few times a week the following semester, that one wasn’t great either. 

I came to the conclusion I need to quit entirely and the reason is two-fold: the declining utility of getting high, and the negative consequences of long-term abuse.  

**Weed’s Declining Utility**

If paranoia and anxiety attacks are avoided, getting high is fun at first. Really enjoyable. Fifteen year old me had a great time laughing at everything, tearing through bags of Goldfish, and listening to The Weeknd’s first three albums on repeat. 

As the years go on, the doses get higher, and smoking becomes a daily practice, this changes. Getting high becomes normal. The grins disappear, along with the “profound” thoughts. 

I’m convinced there’s a scientific reason behind this for whatever-the-fuck reason with our dopamine levels. Regardless, anyone who’s smoked regularly for a long period of time will agree.
 
Daily smoking makes the feeling become muted. You can smoke and forget you’re even high. The effects are still “there”, but they aren’t at the forefront of the mind anymore. It makes you hungry, lazy, and unable to focus, but the magic is gone. 

**Negative Health Effects**

At the risk of sounding like someone’s mom, I was hesitant to write this article. Weed isn’t a “hard” drug and getting high won’t ruin your life. However, through a combination of personal reflection and research, I’ve concluded that smoking daily is shitty for you in a number of ways. Let me list them off. 

Cognitive Issues - “cannabis temporarily prevents the brain from developing new memories and learning new things.” Recall how I didn’t remember much of sophomore year? The drug took my short-term memory and pissed all over it. Take a single month as perspective. If you smoke 31 nights in a row, temporarily causing a stop in the creation of memories, how much of that month are you going to remember? Now imagine doing it for years and years. It would fuck up anyone. 

Binge Eating - let’s be transparent with each other: I don’t smoke a blunt and then eat a kale salad and neither do you. I open up DoorDash and get a large Buffalo Chicken Pizza from the greasiest restaurant possible. In the short-term, great. Fucking delicious! But, when you smoke every day? The extra calories add up. A 500 calorie surplus without exercise is enough to get fat within a few years, and when I get high, I probably eat closer to 1000 calories that I wouldn’t when sober. 

Impaired Sleep - going to bed high would often leave me groggy, irritable, and drowsy the next morning. The first time I stopped smoking weed, the insomnia was real: I’d stay awake in bed for hours, often until the early morning. The scientific evidence is limited on this subject: some studies show THC enhances sleep, others show it weakens it. So, it's more of a personal anecdote: for me, I undoubtedly get better rest going to bed sober. I wake up less throughout the night, have actual dreams, and wake up energized. But, I want to tread the line carefully here: I’m not stating this as a fact, but for me weed absolutely messed with my sleep. 

**Conclusion**

Despite everything, I miss smoking. I won’t deny it. Passing a joint around a bonfire with friends, hitting a dab pen and walking through nature, or getting baked on my balcony and looking at the stars are all experiences I won’t have anymore. 
In Econ 102, I learned about utility functions. They come in different forms but tend to have a defining characteristic: the more you do something, the less happiness it brings you. When it comes to weed, it’s true. The dopamine release from checking off a difficult task or finishing a long run are the new highs I’m chasing. 

I’m not anti-weed and I don’t regret most of my experiences with it–being young and doing dumb shit is an important part of life. I’ve just had enough.",165,"{'virus': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4286676}"

When talking to my partner or friends I feel the same way and sometimes need to pause and take a second to find the right word to use.

Recently I’ve been pausing mid sentence and trying hard to find my words as I hope it can help me reconnect the neural connections  in my brain that seem apparently broken.

I'm back on day 1 again, since my last try ended after around 16 hours of soberness. 
So, yesterday I threw my last piece to the lake, again. Some more fish are going to be ultra high.

I thought a lot about my consume today and I think I figured out something important:

Everytime I restart pursuing the green drug, I'm like Tom trying to shoot Jerry, but actually I just point the weapon towards myself.

I came to this conclusion after 1 month of soberness in Turkey. After 3 rough weeks of withdrawal I started to feel more balanced, happier and satisfied with my life. I think these few days were some of the best in my life. 

And then, on new years eve, Tom appeared with his gun. He asked me: ""Hey Bro, wanna take a small hit with the swedish guy you just met? You've come so far and you feel so good, it will be different this time."" 
I believed my inner Tom and took this ""small hit"".

After leaving Turkey and travelling on to Nepal, Tom returned and asked me: ""Hey Bro, wanna buy some Nepali Hash? It's famous for it's quality and you really need to try it!""
I believed my inner Tom again and got a shitload of it, because it's fucking cheap here. That's where Tom started shooting heavily, because:

3 weeks later after smoking everyday, all day long, I'm feeling down. There's almost nothing that gives me a thrill or satisfies me anymore, it's just the stoner emptiness again. 

I should stop listening to Tom. He's always so enthusiastic and confident with his ideas, but doesn't notice, that he hurts himself everytime.

2022-01-24 07:30:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sbl5fg/hour_45/,Hour 45.,"I'm not even counting days yet. I will when I hit a week. I've tried to quit multiple times over the last 2 years, but I've always had that one instance where I thought I could just smoke once or twice, and not go back to being reliant, or just once every few days, and not increase that. I can't. BUT I think it's valuable that I learned that, and that there is no in between - for me - and picking up the bong once doesn't mean once, it means I'm a smoker. 

I no longer identify as a smoker, and I haven't, for probably close to a year. Just someone that keeps falling off the wagon. But the mindset of considering myself a non-smoker has been incredibly helpful - it HAS made me think every single time I smoke, and it HAS led me to this. 

I quit smoking cigarettes probably around 5 years ago, after smoking for about 5 years. Since then, I've been vaping, with a few attempts at quitting. I quit nicotine exactly 30 days ago. I have no cravings. I have no desire to go back. I do not like who I am when I vape or smoke weed, and that's an inescapable fact for me now. I guess the one thing about having a high tolerance is a lot of clarity, no matter what you do. 

But I just want to get back to being inside my mind all the time, like I was when I was a kid. I don't want to have to check in with myself, remember what I wanted to accomplish last night or this morning before work, and not ever have a chance because I smoked before and after work and forgot. I don't want my lungs to continue being damaged, and I'm young enough that hopefully there will be some level of repair. I don't want to keep taking redirecting my neurons and killing off fatty acids, almost guaranteeing memory and cognitive problems for myself in later age. 

I'm really proud of myself for making an irrevocable choice, but I am deeply embarrassed of my aggressive, anxious, irritable disposition. 

I don't want to alleviate this by eating too much, or specifically eating a lot of sugar, because weight gain has been the reason, all 3 times now, that I went back to nicotine to cut my appetite. 

Walking every day has been incredibly helpful. Drinking a lot of water to flush out toxins is another go to. 

I just... need someone to tell me my friends and family will understand and support me. That it's okay not to be okay for a little while, but in a few weeks or months, this will mellow out and I will actually know and control myself better. Quitting is one thing, but the emotional journey... that's another. Especially when cannabis has been my crutch for a decade. But I do not want a crutch. I want to feel the highs and the lows, otherwise I'm nothing but a functioning zombie.

After new years I was so down and depressed, that I intended on going to my PhD supervisors and quitting after 1 years work. I felt adamant that quitting would be for the better. 10 years of joints (almost) everyday, and very few succesful month long breaks, and I still have a hard time admitting that my problems stem mostly from chronic use of hash and weed. 

Anyways, I shared my plan with my mom, and she tried to convince me to stop smoking first of all. As most times before, I refused to face the truth, but would rather blame a slight depression, and lack of meaning at work, for my state of mind. We agreed to go see my doctor together so that I could get a referral to a psychologist and perhaps get a written recommendation to take a break. 

I have never asked for as much help as this before, when it comes to my mental health. I could not be totally honest with my supervisors, as to why I was feeling depressed and lacked meaning. I still believe that the prevailing stigma in academia, when it comes to mind-altering drugs, is too great to make total honesty beneficial. anyways..

With all the welcoming help I received, I could not get myself to keep smoking. I felt more committed than ever, and still do today. However I can also see that commitment to improvement fade away now, and I feel the need, to jot down my thoughts I had the last days in the haze.

I was procrastinating everything, and mastered the art of suppressing anxiety. It came to the point where the excuse to smoke to fall asleep was a big lie. I would suddenly sit up right in bed and shout/mutter for 1 second, as a reaction to my internal conflict and suppressed stress. I had so little sense of control. That's not a state I wanna tolerate in myself ever again. 

I laid awake at a friends house until 8 am on January the 3rd. A Monday morning, where I was supposed to get to work after 2 weeks break. I was in dire need of sleep, but chose smoking, denial, suppression of emotions, instead of calling to action. Having done so many times before the last year, this time still felt different, because it felt as a serious commitment to quit. As if I was finally putting the final nail in the coffin of my PhD position. I was apathetically watching myself self-sabotage my career, by simply being passive. 

I don't recommend going this far down the drain in order to touch rock bottom hoping to rebound. I had to mention my state of mind to my friend the following day. I needed help, I needed a shoulder to cry on, I needed to express my dissatisfaction. The following Friday and was relieved to have support and understanding coming my way from family, friend and colleagues. 

Here are som of the changes I have noticed going sober:  
The fear of racing thoughts and change in personality, was greater than the actual outcome. If I can't sleep, I can just experience myself, and do so more fully than ever could high at night. My friends, don't fear changes. Let them come over you and judge them afterwards. Take it one day at a time. You'll notice low moods, but you'll notice the change to the better as well. Sometimes even on the same day, the same hour, the same moment. 

After two weeks of staying straight, I sat at my computer at home and tried working on the small tasks I had accepted to keep from work. I thought of one of my best friend ever. Our 11.5 years old boxer dog, whom my family had to put down the day before New Years Eve. I felt so sad, and felt just as sad as the days before quitting smoking. That day will still serve me as a great lesson. Never trust your outlook in the darkest moments. Sense yourself, but don't anticipate the future to be constrained. but this moment. Look forward, and try to facilitate a positive change of mood. 

I don't necessarily believe that we have sufficient free will to just simply pull ourselves up from dark places. Depressed individuals should not blame themselves for inability to take positive action on a whim. But remember that change is possible. 

I got up, took a long walk, and noticed my mood change. I reminded myself, that the dreams that night had started the day in a sour mood. Since then I have tried to use movement and light therapy as a way to set the day off right. Wow, looking into bright light for 30 mins can really change my mood. So does cold showers. I have been practicing them on and off for a few years, and I benefit from them more than ever. Cold showers, exercise, food, light. 

This is my last week before going back to work. I feel crushed after a long weekend with minimal sleep. I feel ecstatic and nervous when thinking about the girl I met Saturday night. First kiss in along time. Looking so much forward to meeting her again. Also feeling vulnerable after feeling myself fall in love for the first time in 8 years. I don't wanna make her into more than she is, but I have to have some hope. Today is tough, and I needed to remind myself of the journey, that these last 3 weeks have been. What a ride! 

I'll check in again soon. Always had a hard time reading posts here (I was high). After quitting that has changed, and I *really* appreciate the support being passed around here. Much love to everybody out there to those struggling to quit, to those struggling to stay sober, and to those whom inspire.

Since i moved to the US i started smoking marijuana instead of hash , (wich is another form of the plant 🪴 ) but damn this marijuana started giving me so much anxiety/stress/paranoia and i just felt so bad about myself for spending so much money on it, it just didn't make any sense to me to smoke anymore, i felt stupid.

I would smoke a joint of weed then when i'm done with it i would light up a cigarette 🚬  but lately the weather has been getting colder and i've been having really dry lips from either the cold or from smoking too much i'm not too sure what is the reason behind me getting such dry lips but one thing was sure, i hated it, i hated the feeling of sucking on cigarettes or a joint with those extra dry lips, i hated myself.At that point i felt that i was just hurting myself and that i was spending way too much money 💰(i don't make that much yet since i haven't been here for long )on something that was not doing me any good neither psychologically nor physically.

I knew that something had to be done, i tried quitting several times in the past but i would always end up relapsing.How could i stop when my best friend here smokes as much or maybe even more than i did ? Bottom line, i had to limit contact with this friend and find a way to fight the ""cravings""

Three weeks ago i woke up and i had 4 cigarettes left in my pack and 0 weed  and i decided not to buy any, i decided that those four would be my last and that i would not spend a single penny on that shit anymore,so i go to work and i smoke those four cigarettes and just kept on working and working, i think i worked around 14 hours that day, i had to keep myself occupied with something, so that i wouldn't think about the craving from both substances.As you can imagine it was not all that easy but my motivation was stronger than the cravings this time.

What allowed me to not relapse this time was due to three these following factors: 

-Me not being able to afford spending money on weed and cigarettes and support my family overseas at the same time wich gave me a great sense of guilt.

-Me realizing how harmful my behavior was to my own body (sadly it tooke over 14 years to realize that).

-I kept myself busy with work (i do deliveries for these gig apps Doordash, grubhub ect.) I would work up to 14 hours a day.I guess that my body and brain where so tired that they would prioritize rest and sleep over giving me the craving feeling so whenever i get home now i don't think about smoking anymore all i want is food and rest/sleep.

-I started cleaning the basement in wich i live, i had made it my life purpose 😆 to clean everything, there was a lot of work to be done and that kept me busy for days ! Whenever i get the craving feeling (wich lasts around 20minutes ) i would go and clean/organize whatever was in front of me

-i limited contact with my best friend we would just speak over the phone and i asked him to never mention weed/cigarettes and any good feeling associated with them.

-I started reading online posts and watching youtube videos about people who had managed to quit in the past, for exemple i learned that the ""craving feeling"" would only last about 20 minutes and then it would just go, before i thought that i would just be stuck in perpetual state of craving 😅 wich was wrong ! The cravings will disappear you just need to hold yourself together for 10-20 minute.

-I put in the trash anything realted to smoking wich consisted of 13 lighters, 3 grinders, 2 ash plates rolling paper ect...

As a conclusion i'd like to say that i am still fighting but i really don't believe that i will relapse again because otherwise i would feel like i am the dumbest person on earth. I wish that this will be helpful to anyone that is trying to fight the urge to smoke and that this was written in an understandable English (Sorry it's not my primary language) Good luck everyone!

My 2cents here is that if you plan on quitting, keep reading the stories here until you want to relate, I read them everyday while still blazing and it kind of got into my head at last.

All the best to everyone and keep going if you have already started. Just focus on getting through TODAY EVERYDAY.

I'm now 28 turning 29 in a week. I dropped out of highschool @ 18. I was never able to maintain a job for longer than 2 years. I was angry and critical all the time. I talked more than I did the things I said I would do. I've been unemployed for 2 years and getting government help.  

My girlfriend of 3+ years left me because of my ambition, mood and outlook in life. I took out my frustration in life on this relationship but it was my lack of drive in life that ultimately ended us. She moved out and I'm living alone, worrying about my rent and other bills on my own now without a car as well. I've been so codependent in life that now I am alone for the first time, in a long time. 

I have to stop now. I've had ENOUGH. I'm doing online classes to get my diploma, I'm running a marathon on May 1 and I'm exercising everyday for about 2hours. I have anxieties everyday that I cannot do this anymore. I've hated myself for so long that I've been so dependent on marijuana, I'm upset that I kept spiraling down this rabbit hole and I watched myself the whole time for 10+ years. 

I lost the one girl that made me feel like it's ok not to be ok. I asked for her back and now we will re open the relationship in 3 months.. she said she would be there at the finish line at the end of my marathon. Now I'm doing everything I thought was impossible. I'm back doing online school for my diploma, I'm running a freaking marathon, I'm exercising everyday, I'm finding a job to keep the roof over my head, and all the while I'm quitting weed. 

These goals feel impossible all the while I have ADHD/Depression & Anxiety. But after reading everyone's testimonies, I'm inspired to see the world in a different light, I want to see life you're all preaching you've achieved after months of quitting. My life has been flipped upside down and I'm scared but at the same time I'm on a warpath to make things right. For myself, my relationship and for my life.

At the time, I was at rock bottom, depression, anxiety, no money, no help, all of them stemmed from my marijuana addiction. I abandoned everything in my life for that little vice. 

My sobered friends, who were truly the most passionate people advised me to stay away from weed, stopped hanging out with me, and I didn't want to hang out with them for not smoking weed. 

After few months of smoking, I went into deep depression due to chemical imbalance which, at the time, I didn't even know was possible, so I started blaming everything else, but marijuana, for destroying my mental state. 

Money was the biggest burden. I struggled to pay for rent and food, and also maintain my 2-gram-a-day habit. I had to borrowed money left and right because I didn't want to work for a ""low level"" fast food restaurant to instead work on my ""passion"" for music. Instant noodle was my life saver. I had a lot of mental breakdown every time I looked into how much money I had left. 

It has been a really really long time that I've bought a single new thing. I've been wearing the same clothes for the past 3 years, used the same broken phone for 3 years, one of my shoe had a hole as well as many of my socks. Weed gave me a good feeling for living a mediocre lifestyle, heck, this is way below mediocre.  

I just sat down a did the math after paying off almost all of my debt, took out what's needed for rent, food, and transit, I spared about $200. I then just sat there and had a little smile for a good minute, it was such a massive relief, the moment I realized I have 100% got out of the mess I got into.

At around 1 week you will feel much better about yourself confidence wise which may start to drain out with desires/cravings but don't get worried it only gets better from here

At around 2-3 weeks you will be coughing alot of tar for me at 2-4 weeks tar was coming out of me in big globs but know this means soon you'll breath in fresh air and feel like you actually got a good deep breath

At around a month you will be seeing real change in your ability to say no to cravings and brush them off with occasional harder cravings that get easier to brush off each time they come but stress may get higher, note if you also do breathing exercises or just heavy breath to get oxygen in and out of you it gets better even faster and hot/spicy foods work miracles 

At around 2 months stress will also become much easier to deal with and only more so if you do things like self reflect or meditate or moderate exercise

At around 3 months things will seem much more easy to deal with and cravings will be almost non existent, you should start looking into things to do like hobbies and stuff too either now or before just don't Over burden yourself too early I made that mistake on my first attempt 😊 

At 4 months your gonna feel like a million bucks compared to when you first quit and it only gets better also I recommend trying new foods and activities you've never done before after all the money you saved from not smoking may as well go somewhere you'll find joy 😉 

At 5 months you'll breath so much easier that it'll feel like you never smoked depending on how long you smoked and how frequently and from what I hear it only keeps getting better 😉 ❤️ 

I'll update again at 10 months I already know for a fact ill be hitting that goal so see yall in a little less than 5 more months for an update 😊😇",99,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.91814965}"

I'm so glad to tell you all as someone who smoked up to 25 joints a day sometimes 1 after the other just killing myself slowly always wondering if it was worth quitting, wondering if I'd even be able to heal, that I'm at 5 months (actually slightly above 😀) 

Know that even after 5 years of smoking like that and Binge drinking for 2 years I was able to make a change. I was able to prove my self doubt wrong. And so can you. 
You have the power and you can be healthy and be the best you 😄.

I wouldn't have even started if not for this reddit thread. And now I'm at a place I thought I'd never see. I thought I'd die or get seriously sick for life and I proved myself wrong. I was strong enough to over come addiction and I breath better than I have in years. And I finally feel my emotions like I'm a kid again. I'm not numb all the time like I used to be. 

I'm also 2 weeks sober from booze on top of my 5 months of sobriety from pot. And that's only cause I wanted to partake in family and social drinking over the holidays otherwise I'd be at 3 months for that too. You have the power to do it too. Never let your inner self lie to you. Freedom from addiction is right around the corner whenever you want it.

I'd also like to add even after 5 months of being smoke free I'm still coughing up tar lol but mostly only when I eat really spicy foods these days and every time I cough up tar I don't worry like I did at first when I first quit last June I look at the tar and smile and tell my family I'm 1 step closer to being the healthiest me I've ever been and they make jokes and smile right back 😃",10,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6419676}"

I've smoked since I was 19 and really became embraced by it by 25. I'm 36 now. Daily use with few exceptions since I moved to Colorado about 7 and a half years ago.

For something that gave me so much joy and little hangover it sure surprised the hell out of me to go through such an ordeal to quit. I quit nicotine after 12 years (it was very tough) and from a  psychological withdrawal stand point - weed takes the cake bar none. It's a little hellish at times. I mentioned before that the drug is insidious because of the timing it takes to come off, to clean up (THC can be in your system up to 90 days unlike must drugs that are out of your system relatively quick comparatively) but also what it effects. It's one of the only drugs that effects damn near every place in your brain. The withdrawal effects can be subtle vs your typical abuse drugs but they are loooooonnng lasting and annoying, frankly.

Spending far too much money. Not only on weed itself but on all the shit food you end up buying and eating while laid like some kind of insatiable disgusting slug.

We knew it would be hard and originally we planned on quitting New Year’s day, but kept holding it off. We didn’t want any temptations so we put all of our “supplies” in a storage unit. 

For me, the journey has been better than expected. I have been wanting to stop for a while. I am a teacher and I’ve had enormous guilt about what I do in my free time compared to what I do for a living. So far, I’ve picked up a few new hobbies like working out, reading, and journaling. I’ve also really enjoyed sleeping with dreams and waking up well-rested. 

While I have had a few moments where I think back to smoking, so far I enjoy my life a little more without it. I like the clear mind. My boyfriend has been having a different experience and has a hard time talking about it. I want to talk with him but I know that he is struggling without it since he saw it as a crutch. We started this journey together and I want to be there for him but I don’t know what I can do without reminding him of it. 

Is there any advice on helping someone around you as well as yourself to stay motivated to stop without having the opposite effects by bringing it up? For me, talking about it helps but not for him. I just want to know if there’s someone out there that dealt with stopping the same way and had a different outlet instead of talking about it?

This sounds so selfish, but we started this journey together. I know that if he goes back, I will have a much harder time doing it alone. That’s why we started together so we can talk about it with someone else. I want to be there for him, I just haven’t found the best method and I want to make sure we are both successful.

Hopeful to see more benefits this next month, especially regarding focus.

I'm having a hard time with my quitting process.  About 7 months ago my dad passed away and my consumption of weed just skyrocketed. I had a hard time before this because of the pandemic we entered in 2020, but i tought it was controllable. When my dad passed away I started to smoke from 5 to 10 joints a day. After a lot os therapy sessions I finally decided to quit smoking. But I'm having such a hard time. Today is my 3th day without smoking, and even that I was smoking just 1 joint a day I'm very very depressed without it. Do you guys have any recomendations on what I can do to forget the weed, even if it is for a short period?

I started reducing my drinking three years ago and am now sober a month.  In the meantime I’ve been diagnosed with type two diabetes and high cholesterol and had to go on meds (even after I changed diet, fitness, am 117 pounds now… genetics!! Gah!)

My husband drinks heavily at night and now we aren’t talking (but we do have our first therapy session this Thursday) because I can’t handle his addiction.  He’s a nice guy and a “happy” drunk but his health is terrible, he’s overweight, and he only wants to interact with me once or twice a week which isn’t “my” idea of a relationship.  We sleep in separate rooms and have no common interests which is his fault because he doesn’t want to “waste” his time on things he isn’t interested in.

I recently moved to a new city and have no friends (have a few possibilities, though!) and my family (mom and dad) are both addicts (booze/pot) and recently invited my 20 something cousins I rarely see over for dinner and invited some random older couples but specifically told me not to pop over tonight because I wasn’t invited.  I don’t cause drama and haven’t been ranting about sobriety so I blame them for simply being thoughtless and wrapped up in their own mental deficiencies.

I was doing pretty good with everything until I quit pot. Now I’m depressed, having mini anxiety attacks, feel hopeless, rarely get off the couch and only to take my dog out for half the walk she used to get, and am just over all of it.  

To top it all off I’ve been trying to restore this 1993 Mitsubishi 3000gt VR4 and it died mysteriously at the alignment shop on Friday morning and the shop I had it towed to still hasn’t been able to diagnose it and that increases my anxiety because very few people have any skill with these and the mechanic I was lucky enough to find is booked so I may be looking at a fiasco with this new place and there’s so much sentimental value in this car I’m crying now just writing this.  

It’s all quite the literal mess and I want to run but I have no where to go. I have no drug to escape into. Books aren’t holding me. Movies work for a few hours MAYBE and then I can’t watch more. I’m tired. I’m alone. I’m hurting in so many ways I can’t even sort it all out.  

And the worst part? I did it all to myself. I choose this and now I’m suffering with it all.  I could have just stayed the cute, bubbly lush with my husband and the fun daughter my parents used to invite to meet all their friends because of how eccentric and interesting I was but nope… I had to break away from the norm in the name of bettering myself and it honestly SUCKS.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8235568}"

I feel like (and maybe I just feel this way because I’m pissed off and jumpy and anxious and crazy right now without bud) this sub is often full of nothing but success stories, people riding the pink cloud and acting superior and fixed, people saying it “wasn’t even that hard”, people who went cold turkey and never relapsed, people saying “it’s just weed, just stop”, people insinuating that I must not really want health and sobriety if I can’t attain it. To those of you who can make it a day, much less years, that’s awesome, and I’m so proud of you.

But I’m over here, feeling completely fucking incapable of making it a full day without smoking. And yes, I know cold turkey is the only way. I also know I won’t ever be able to moderate. 

I’ve gone from smoking from 6am everyday until whenever I pass the fuck out to not smoking until I get home, and when so do smoke, it’s WAY less. I’m smoking less than a quarter of what I used to smoke every day, feeling better and saving money too. But this progress feels worthless without a single sober day. It’s been coming up on 7 years, every single fucking day, of this self destructive bullshit. And no, I’m not telling myself I’m tapering. I want to be DONE, but progress is all I can accomplish right now.

I’m doing my best and I know I’m making progress but sometimes I come here and feel like I’m just gonna get told I must not be “truly ready to quit”. Like, no, I need and want to be here, I just can’t be that fucking good yet.

Idk. Anyone else feel this way, or browse here day in and day out but still fucking failing every single day? Just feeling really alone right now, and getting kind of tired of hearing “just wait ten minutes, cravings go away after ten minutes” even though I know it’s good advice. Threw away my stash but I live in a legal state and dispo is across the fucking street so that didn’t exactly provide much of an obstacle for me.

What the fuck man. I’m so over this. I hate weed. I would do anything to have never tried this bullshit plant. FUCK. I wish I could just lock myself in a fucking cell for two weeks or take some time off but I have to work. I live paycheck to paycheck.

TL;DR Can’t fucking get it together for one sober day much less stacking two together. Feel like a fucking failure and like my situation and feelings aren’t welcome anywhere because I’m not sober but not an absolute pothead vegetable like I usually am either. Just feeling really alone right now and hoping someone else feels/felt this way.

First of all, thank you to everyone that's offered to message me or has messaged me since my last post. It's genuinely helped a lot to get my mind off of some things, and while I'm not 100% better now, I've made a lot of big steps I think. First and foremost, I've made it to Day 5. I've done one t-break before this past summer, where I stopped smoking for about 2 weeks, and I remember how much of a struggle that was for me. I don't know if it's my motivation behind quitting or what, but this time feels a lot easier. I'm proud of making it this far, and excited to continue.

Interestingly enough, I don't find myself missing weed that much as of yet. I'm more preoccupied and stressed about getting my life back together after the fallout of my weed addiction to the point where I haven't really had time or desire to think about smoking. I'm also happy to announce that I got my first night of (decent) sleep last night!! Wasn't totally perfect, and yeah I had to take some sleep-aid prescription medication, but compared to basically being awake with my eyes closed for several hours, it was a much needed change.

Finally, I've actually started on a school assignment. After failing last semester and getting put on academic probation, I felt like my life was over. My parents have been extremely supportive and kind to me, but I haven't extended myself that same care. Dealing with undiagnosed ADHD and a weed addiction without any prescription medication has been incredible difficult, and the endless cycle of guilting myself has led to my anxiety eating away any motivation I had. Despite this, I spent the early part of today scrolling through various posts on the ADHD subreddit, looking for tips, posts I could relate to, and ways to make light of a dark situation. In doing so, I somehow found the strength and courage to make a to-do list and get one of my readings for a class done. I have a lot of work to do, and even just typing that out makes me feel kind of anxious and scared, but nobody can deny the fact that I've taken one step. I've accomplished something today. I'm going to finish those readings for that class, and then I don't know what.

My next steps are sending a text that I drafted earlier to my parents asking to be evaluated for ADHD, and asking to be put in therapy. I know my parents would support me, but it's such a scary and sort of infantilizing feeling asking for help. I hope I can pull together the courage to hit send.

I feel like I’ve slipped again, weed has been a very destructive influence in my life since I started smoking when I was 16 (20 now). The social withdrawal, avolition and anxiety has caused me a lot of trouble maintaining relationships (and feeling present within them). Yet after promising to quit last summer I relapsed a month ago and have got to the point of smoking almost every other day again.

I’m just a bit frustrated with myself. I was doing so well, I had 3 months completely sober (I chose to avoid alcohol for a time as well), I was engaged and proactive with my studies. weed brings nothing positive to my life bar a few hours of escape. I care less about hygiene, my health and my goals when I’m smoking. I was consistently getting 65%+ at university last year. I finished this semester with 54% in one of my modules and I know I can do better.

I feel like a failure, given how proud I was of my progress. But making that promise to be better in the face of my loved ones also makes it very hard for me to go to them for support now that I’m struggling again.

In my mind I keep reiterating that it’s going to be a difficult process and that I should be kind to myself. But I feel there’s a point in that where I’m just making excuses. I don’t want to miss out on things, i don’t want to lose precious time with my family and my girlfriend. I want to succeed with my studies and socialise like I used to. 

I think my main priority this time around should be finding healthy coping mechanisms for my emotions, so I have options instead of running back to the plug as soon as things get tough. Now it’s time to get back on the horse and tackle quitting again, day 1 :)

About 4 years ago I was shot inside of my home by an intruder on the outside which lead to some pretty rough PTSD.

Since then I’ve gotten my medical card and geared my strains more towards helping with the PTSD. However, I will admit I do overuse it during the day which is when my PTSD isn’t triggered as badly. 

I’m on day 6 of trying to leave but man these nightmares are getting bad. Every single night I’m having multiple nightmares that get exhausting. I’m being shot, running from being shot, or scared for my life. 

Is it going to be like this forever? I hate knowing I’m at the grip of marijuana but at least with it I can sleep peacefully. Everyday I’m waking up exhausted and ready to sleep all day. Almost like I just got off a 12 hour shift. Does anyone else deal with this or something similar? Looking to see if I’m alone or for any help.

I failed after 13 days 😔,"I was doing really well and enjoyed the sobriety despite being difficult. I noticed all the wonderful changes to my brain.. Was beginning to feel more social, confident and alert. On Friday I met with friends and a few were smoking but I didn't feel an urge to smoke, the thought of keeping this going and not failing was overwhelming. Then came Saturday night and I went out alone withy previous smoking partner. I informed her beforehand and whilst we met why I gave up and how I've benefited and that we could meet up but I'd prefer her smoking beforehand for now.. She was initially positive and happy but after an hour into the chill her dealer popped up and she said she'll be smoking...the rest is history. There was an overwhelming realisation that despite knowing this person for years.. This person was someone that I needed to kick out of my life for good.. Not merely because of her not being able to support me for one night but it was the first time in years I met her sober and realised that the weed has made her a negative character and it was that negativity and nihilistic behaviour that I don't need.

Hard realisation after many years but I think I need to put myself as priority. I don't want to see this as starting from zero as I feel I've done well. I've woken up depressed and anxious but also hopeful as I didn't enjoy the whole process.",44,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44651747}"

I want to start by wishing you a happy new year and may this year be full of great achievements, overcoming challenges, and reaching greater heights.

Note: this is a LONG read, so if you’re in a hurry, turn on text-to-speech! Lol 

As the title states, I’ll be sharing my experience with smoking weed and the struggles I have trying to quit.

To understand my context, I’m from a conservative society where for most of my upbringing was closed to the outside world. My culture has very specific mindset that for most the world comes across as close-minded. So the idea of using drugs, partying, and what is preserved as “western” pretty much didn’t exist. My connection to that was through the internet and media. I said to myself I want to see the world and understand how other cultures think. I wanted to know why my culture was so different to the rest of the world. Fast forward to graduating high school. I moved to California to pursue my bachelors. I was 19 at the time (I just turned 30 this month). My time in California, I learned a lot about the world, I was living in a diverse community where I had an insight to almost every part of the world. The unique mixed ethnicities helped me understand and learn how to think and accept differences.

So as a typical college boy, I found myself partying and smoking weed. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t peer pressure. No not at all. I chose for myself. I wanted to see what was the hype is all about. After experimenting, I realized I preferred weed over drinking. I started to learn more about weed, observing how my body reacts to different strains, and finding my limit. Unfortunately, that limit never seemed to hit! 

Smoking up has become a daily thing for me for 9 years now!!! My day is planned around weed. Now that I write it, it actually sad to read. But that’s my struggle. I enjoy weed. It helps me, I don’t know how, but it does. I don’t see it as a drug. I see weed as a close buddy who’ll always be there for me when I’m in need. I say that because in California I went through depression and weed helped me overcome it (I’m back home now). And also two years ago I had lymphoma, and it was there for me to help with the chemotherapy pains. Thankfully, I did great in college. I’m doing great at my job. I’m saying that to clarify that thankfully I’m doing great at life.

Now that I’m home, to my surprise, things have changed drastically. Drugs are still restricted, but are available. So the struggle of enjoying the experience vs how the community preserves it is a daily struggle. 

I read here from people that actually quit that they go on to discover great things about themselves. I reached a point where I want to quit, and discover myself. However I’m in this repetitive daily cycle that goes like this:

Wake up > smoke up > check calendar > breakfast > work > back home > smoke up > lunch > whatever is planned > smoke up > sleep

By the time I smoke up before sleep, I reflect on my day and feel sorry for myself on how much I’m dependent on smoking up and say tomorrow is going to be different and that I’m not going to restock once the batch is finished. Sadly, the next morning I wake up as if my brain didn’t register the dialogue I had the previous night. And on repeat.

If you reached to this point, I thank you for your sincerity and understanding. You’re a wonderful warm hearted person. And I apologize if it was difficult to much to read.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45981643}"

The day after that I wanted to smoke again so i bought 2g of weed. I rolled up a really long joint to smoke on my balcony as per usual. I took about 10 hits and noticed that i was already really high. Uncomfortably high. A non weed high. My heart started beating out of my chest I was shaking everywhere and my vision was completely blurred. I just laid in bed and accepted that i might be dying.

The days after I didn‘t talk to anyone due to how angry it made me. If I would’ve finished the whole joint I am convinced I would have died. One of my worst experiences ever. I did a lot of thinking and to be honest my health and life is much more important than smoking a plant. I can‘t imagine smoking again right now. Afraid to smoke again.

I don't know if the title is true but it's certainly a milestone. When I think about the last two weeks of 2021 and consuming an ounce those 2 weeks, endlessly rolling and smoking, knowing that I would never be satisfied, I'm so glad that I stuck through long enough to want sobriety more now. I felt so embarrassed, insecure and out of control. I was smoking so much, eating shit, masturbating all the time and just behaving like a sloth of a human. 

I'm 30 and when I started smoking at around 20, I never would have guessed I'd have spent most of my twenties high as a kite and unable to keep jobs or relationships. What a foolish girl I was! After initially smoking through the paranoia of the first few times high, it offered me a lot of comfort and an opportunity to escape. When I was 20 and finishing my undergrad, I would smoke at night only and I remember realizing I couldn't sleep without it. I wish I could go back and warn myself how much more serious this drug is than it's marketed. But here we are and the experience is humbling and human. 

It hasn't been easy and it hasn't been hard. Life itself is hard y'all. But it's easier sober and so much healthier. I mean there was so much I was/am avoiding. Things like dishes and laundry and responsibilities in general. Also my depression and loneliness and perpetual dread. In a way it was fabulous just masking it. I do believe I would have progressed a lot farther in my career if it wasn't for weed but that's the tradeoff I made. I'm just grateful to have preserved my health above all. 

On another note, idk if it's facts, but I think weed gave me some protection from Covid because I got it about a week after quitting. So that was tough for the past couple of weeks as I haven't felt good enough to workout properly. I've lost 4 pounds in only the past week or so from switching up my diet to a low carb one. I'm a total addict and I've cut out most coffee and caffeine as well. 

I meditated today, although I haven't done so daily. I've been doing more sun salutations than last year. I'm somewhat sharper, can't say I've noticed a major difference yet but the best part about quitting for me, by far, is that I'm starting to get my confidence and self respect back. I once heard that to get self respect you need to do something that you respect, lol duh! I was so ashamed of my addiction that I couldn't possibly respect myself. So many milestones came and went and I would just say okay lets just smoke what I've got, and when it would inevitably runout, I'd be down the street to the dispensary in 10 minutes. 

I can't get back the wasted time and memories from my twenties but I can try to be better today and tomorrow and every day after that. Cheers guys, thanks for the support r/leaves",5,"{'mask': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3860133}"

I don’t know if you know what an earworm is, or if it’s called different things outside of where I’m from, but when I quit smoking weed some song or other will play over and over in my head. like when uou have a song stuck in your head but it’s really intense and repetitive, and just like the briefest moment of the song over and over. I quit and it gets really bad. Smoking alleviates it. Has anyone else had this symptom?

I’m seeing a psychiatrist friday and might ask for something for this. I really want to stop but the mental chatter and music when I quit make me badly want to smoke. By chatter I mean like that voice if you’re one of those people who talks to themselves all day, like me.

Here’s a long post reflecting on my first week. Hopefully this serves as encouragement to anyone just starting out. For context, strong lifestyle 24/7 chronic here for 15+ years. A few breaks, but it’s much more realsies this time. I’ve found strength in the lessons learnt in my previous attempts as well, it’s not all lost. A relapse is helpful if it reminds you of all the reasons why you quit in the first place.

Day 0: 

Decided against saving or giving my stash away, it didn’t work last time. I binged hard in the morning and then stopped at lunch, and threw everything out. I’ve found that stopping that way is more sustainable as you don’t have the anxiety of waking up and facing a whole day 1 without smoking, I already had a half day jump.

Day 1: 

First work day of the year, and thinking ‘well done dickhead, this is really going to motivate you’. Work was a distraction though, and even though I was useless, it filled the day. Feeling restless, anxious, irritable. Mostly vegetated and felt down. Played games just to fill the void. 

The first day is garbage. Not worth trying to be anything more than a human getting by. Fill the time. 

Day 2: 

Felt some nausea and still wasn’t very hungry, until nearly dinner time (when I realised I didn’t have lunch). Less irritable, still down though. Finished reading a book and did a lot of laying around. I’m a very active toker (lots of riding and walking), but know it’s important to be gentle at the start. 

Day 3: 

Up waaaay too late, feeling flat. Tired but not sleepy. Overdid it on the caffeine, which I should’ve abstained from probably. HOWEVER, while searching for withdrawal-related answers, I found this group. Where tf were you the last time(s) I did this?? Found a lot of affirmation and echoes of my own experiences. 

Day 4:

Luckily woke up earlier enough to start work, was very flat. Thought a bit flaky, I was still more chatty and better at my job than when I was baked. Found myself whistling and singing a bit more, good signs that I’m feeling better. I keep telling my partner “I want some weed”, but the words ring hollow. I outright know it’s a lie, and I don’t actually want any. It’s like I feel I should want it, like I’m obligated to be that person. Fortunately my partner reminds me that all I do is talk about how I want to stop. Having those around you back up your journey is critical. And if they don’t, maybe they not your peeps after all. 

Somehow I’ve managed to read a whole book this week already. 

Day 5: 

Friday, finally. Work’s become more bearable and it’s become a better distraction – I’m more present and my attention has improved, so I can work longer at tasks, which is less time to think about not smoking. I saw a colleague for coffee and talking was nice. I decide to be social and see if anyone is up to much. I don’t drink either these days, but I can spend time at the bar. I meet old drinking and smoking friends, and while they’d love me to smoke up, I’m not tempted. The thought and the offers are there, but I’m not buying it. I feel more uplifted after socialising and stronger for having past a test. Up much too late again. Not irritable, just not feeling like sleep. Joining the discord chat again was great reinforcement again, I find it helps me when I recognise my same struggles in others’ tales. Making me seem less special and unique reminds me that weed isn’t my identify, its not who I am. I’m empowered that other people feel similarly. 

Day 6: 

After finally sleeping around 5am I woke up at noon. Spent most of the day laying around on duolingo, on here and watching things in the background. I thought how I haven’t been tempted to buy more, and my cravings are less compared with last time when I still had my stash available. Still letting myself be ‘lazy’, which is really just recovery. Every time a thought about ‘oh you should do something you lazy POS, I try to let go, and remind myself that this is something to do – the most important thing for me right now. To let these emotions flow over me and keep on this path. 

Day 7: 

I had a more normal sleep cycle (sometime before 1am) and I woke up feeling fairly alive. Another discord session helps keep me grounded. On my journey, this time I’m not feeling so desperate or anxious about losing that part of my identity. Minimal cravings helps that, however I think it’s the perspective I’ve brought to it as well. My previous all or nothing, perfectionist attitude has hindered my progress in the past. So I am still taking things slowly and softly. Letting myself be ‘lazy’. I’ll get to all my other hobbies eventually, right now I just need to focus on me. This time last week, to the hour, I had already knocked back a couple grams, and I was throwing out my stash. It gets harder and harder to relate to that person, and I know the next challenge is coming: sustaining this over the long term. For now, gentle and soft is the way to go. Focus on letting go, catching myself when I get carried away with self-improvement. Right now, recovery is my hobby, and it’ll support everything else when I’m ready. 

I hope you make it long enough to start appreciating that the real goal here isn’t the absence of weed, it’s all the positive parts of life you can be a part of without it. Simple things like breathing easier, sleeping properly, acknowledging your emotions are the best tools for making the life you actually want to build for yourself.

No insomnia, if anything I had hypersomnia (sleeping too much), which was actually quite pleasant as I felt very relaxed. Although the first 24 hrs were VERY rough with vomiting and sweating, but resolved so quickly.

I am a high functioning user, I hold a VP level role as a sales leader for a large corporation. I can do four bags at the Volcano and a couple dabs and immediately walk into a call or a meeting and nobody knows and it always goes well. For me it’s a performance enhancing drug. It makes my mind fire in all cylinders and it adds the right amount of cavalier attitude that resonates with the people I work with. The problem is that this leads to me overusing to the point I basically become immune and instead of the euphoric high I have come to love so much, I’m using to just get normal.

I’ve taken breaks before, mostly with the intention to lower my tolerance to the point I get the desired effects again. The problem is, every time I’ve done this and gone back, I get to the point of diminishing returns faster and the withdrawal gets worse. This got me thinking, do I want to be in this rhythm forever, using cannabis and loving it for a few months, then abstaining from it for a month with miserable side effects.

I’m 38 and I’ve been using regularly since I was in my late teens. I’ve got a great wife, kids, career, I volunteer at church, I serve others, my parents are proud of me, but I’ve pretty much been high for the last 20 years. I decided that instead of feeling good 9/12 months, I want to feel good 12/12 months and the only way for me to do this is without cannabis.

I don’t blame the flower, it’s me that misused it, but it’s time to stop for good. I’d love to say that I could come back at some point with a clear head and use with moderation, but I’ve disproven that model too many times.

For the first few days quitting this time, it was horrible moods, sleepless nights, issues controlling body temperature, and horrible diarrhea. Fast forward to today and most of that has subsided, but now I’m having vivid dreams, most of them around using cannabis. I had a dream last night that I went out to my barn and did a dab, it was so real that I woke up feeling like I had failed and had to start at day 0 again. I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for a while and thought I would share my experience.

Since I missed the first few days I'll just summarize up to this point.

The fear in that moment was enough to give me the motivation to quit for good. I won't lie, the first few days were horrendous for me as my anxiety started spiraling out of control. Coupled with the fact that I had zero appetite and I had to force myself to eat just made things so much worse. I had forgotten how invasive my thoughts were and all the techniques I had to manage my anxiety seemingly failed overnight.

But, I took things one step at a time and things are getting a little better. My thoughts are still a bit cloudy, my appetite still hasn't returned, but I have started wrangling my anxiety a bit better now. Surprisingly I haven't had any cravings to smoke again. I will say my wife has been an absolute rock for me and gives me all the support I need. She's an absolute gem and these past few days has really shown me that.

I'm about 3 weeks out of a 6 month relapse wherein I vaped thc and nicotine on the hour, every hour. I tried to keep this secret from my significant other and was successful for the most part until a vape fell out of my pocket in front of her, and then the truth fell out of me when she questioned it. I have been sober since that moment.

This has blown up in my face in a spectacular way and has brought to the forefront all of the ways I have been falling short as a partner. I fear I may be staring down the barrel of the end of my decade plus long relationship and the life and world we'd built together.

To be perfectly clear - weed is not responsible for me being a shitty partner and I know that. It certainly didn't help, but the fact that I chose to continue to abuse it is what makes me a shitty partner, and I have to take credit for that decision. I have a lot of support in my life from my family and until very recently in my relationship and I still made this choice. Every day for six months.

I'm filled with disgust for myself. I spent over $1k/mo during this time. I am so filled with self loathing that I'm finding it difficult to fight to keep my relationship alive. I was too stoned to be available for any of the thought/emotional labor of our relationship. I am facing financial ruin because of the expenditure on the mj and all the munchies related debauchery, and also because this financial burden is solely mine and I can't leave any pieces behind for her to pick up.

The kicker? If someone sparked a joint in front of me right now I'd be all over that like white on rice. I am a monster.

If you've managed to make it this far, thanks for coming to my pity party lol. I think I just needed to put this out there for myself, in an effort to hold myself accountable to the person I so desperately want to become.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8054736}"

I would only smoke in the evenings after work and the gym. And I would spend my time high cooking dinner, cleaning, or relaxing. I never thought I might have a weed addiction considering I didn’t let it get in the way of my responsibilities.  That was until last week.  My friend jokingly challenged me that if I didn’t smoke for a day, she’d give me $10. Easy… so I thought. 

That evening I was terrible. I constantly complained to my boyfriend about how bored I was, I ended up rage quitting when making dinner because I was so irritated, and no matter what I did to entertain myself I would get bored of it after 15 minutes. I managed to get through that night after wanting to cave multiple times, but it still threw me for a loop. I thought I had a good relationship with weed but if not smoking for one evening sent me that far into an irritable tirade, I clearly don’t. 

I guess the point of this post is to caution people like me who think they have a handle on smoking, but might need to reevaluate. Waiting until night time/after your responsibilities to smoke does not necessarily mean you don’t have the problem.

Another thing going through my head is what do I want, like really want? Sure I would like to feel good, but is that what life is about, and has weed truly made me feel good about myself or my life?

Thing is, weed is in the way for many things that I desire because it makes me passive, makes me not take action, makes me feel awkward, anxious and stuck in my head. It's an excuse not to make effort towards things because I'm afraid of failing and feeling bad about myself. It shrouds my vision and my life revolves around getting high and feeling pleasure, which in turn makes me feel so so empty and like life has no meaning.

Decided on January 10th that I was going to take a long break. Sadly soon after, I copped covid and became really sick. After I got better, I started to get really depressed. I wasn't waking up in the mornings and my motivation was at an all time low. I knew my brain was low on dopamine cause I wasn't smoking and thought time will fix this. When you're in these moods, the days are longer and unfortunately more depressing. I started to get thoughts of will I be stuck feeling like this forever. I forced myself to go for runs and walks, while it provided temporary relief, id soon become depressed again. Thoughts like ""I'd rather be dead than feel like this"" flooded my mind. I woke up on day 10 feeling the same except with the thought that im gonna try something completely different. I hopped in the shower and had a cold shower. I'm talking freezing cold. It shocked my body. I started breathing really heavily but pushed through it. During that moment, I realised everything I've been through in life didn't matter at that point. I had to focus on survival in the freezing cold water. I didn't think about the past or future. It was the present moment I had to focus on to get through it. I came out and felt the same. But throughout the day, I started to feel a tad more happy. Hour by hour, I started to feel normal again.  Right now I'm laying in bed thinking to myself ""fuck me, I feel great."" Wanted to share it with you guys with the hope of helping someone realise that the shitty feelings don't last forever. You will wake up one day feeling a lot better. My advice is try something new. Something you've never thought you'd do. It could help you realise to live life in the moment and forget about the mistakes of the past and the worrys of the future.

Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks a started smoking earlier in the day and that led to me doing absolutely nothing concerning my studies and just smoking all day to the point where I could not even get high anymore, no matter how much I smoke. Few days ago I returned from the winter break with desire to stop, but everyday I found a reason to continue smoking. Yesterday I decided to finally quit, but I literally don’t have any motivation to do anything besides smoking weed. I feel very anxious and even got suicidal thoughts (I would never do it, but it sucks that I even consider it). Could anyone give me advice on how to get through this?

Some of you may remember my original post back in 2020 in which I discussed quitting weed after a severe anxiety attack that left me cold, numb and running into my mums room in need of warmth and embrace. That night still plays a role in my life, that night shaped who I am and the way I am till this day. For those who never read that post, I was smoking a lot. When I say a lot, I mean a 3.5 to myself everyday sometimes 2. I smoked this final spliff in the heat of family, friend and emotional trouble. This spliff sent me to a dark place. Once this weed used to calm me down but this time it sent me into a realm I can only compare to the film get out in which she is stirring the cup and he falls into his own mind with no escape. I went crazy for 12 hours. Literally completely trapped in thoughts I couldn’t escape with no way of conjuring a new thought. I said to myself if I feel like this in the morning I don’t know how much longer I can do this. Luckily the next morning I was just tired from the ordeal and scared to ever go near weed again.

16 months later...

I guess the original issues came from a feeling of jealousy that my friends were moving on without me, I wasn’t happy in who I wanted to be but I also had demons I had never dealt with. I haven’t smoked weed since. There are so many days I wish I still smoked. Music was better, films were better, I was nicer, I could instantly remove emotion and become heartfelt and empathetic. I am way sharper than I have ever been, that may sound cool but sometimes being sharp and also a overthinker can really be a downfall. When I first started writing this post Which I have wanted to do for while, I did not know where to take it but what I want to say is...

Stopping weed will not instantly solve all your problems, In fact it actually made me face my problems head on and I’m still fighting them till this day. I probably would have carried on smoking if I wasn’t so damaged from the last time BUT... I feel proud that I did it, I had enough of the same shit everyday, everything was passive and the highs were from a high and the lows was just until I smoked again. This post isn’t a ohh look at me I quit, this is a real honest truth in stopping smoking. Thank you for reading and stay blessed.

Everywhere I read it says that symptoms go away in 4 weeks and that it gets better. But I hit 27 days today and I feel worse than I did in the first two weeks. Not necessarily physically worse, but my mind and body are still going pretty crazy. I haven't been sober for an longer than a day over the 9 years I smoked.  in the last 5 years I  smoked nothing but wax, except for the last 4 months I went back to only flower before quiting entirely. I really don't know how to handle being sober. I come from a background of pretty heavy trauma and when I was 17 I found weed as an escape method and I never looked back. But to be completely honest I feel like everything that I am emotionally and physically experiencing right now as a result of putting all of that trauma on pause for so long. I'm currently seeing a therapist and have been for about a year now but I feel like my mental health is steadily getting worse. My health anxiety is at an all-time high and I can't tell if I have genuine problems or if the weed finally leaving my body is allowing me to be present in a body I haven't been present in for so long. My therapist tells me that it may take 4 weeks for the weed to clear from my system but it may take longer for my body to fully return to normal after what I've put it through with smoking.  Thankfully I have an appointment with a primary care provider in a few days to clear up some of the mental anxiety that things could actually be wrong. But as of right now I feel so isolated and sad and scared of everything, my body, my emotions. I haven't gotten good sleep in a few weeks and my appetite is still shot. I think I get at most 1000 calories a day. I can feel it wearing at me and I just feel lost right now.

I wanted to clear my head as I progressed into the next stage of my career. 

Well it worked, I got my promotion, and it cleared my head. I set a goal to refrain for another month while I built a book of business. 

Business came quick and I lapsed, and have smoke daily since sept 2020. I spend about $100 a week on weed, but more importantly I tell myself every day that I need to quit, yet I still smoke multiple times per day. 

It allows me to stop thinking and processing so much. Like my brain is on overdrive and too much to handle until I smoke for the day. 

“I’m doing really well”, “great day at work”, “super productive day in the garden today!” Is all I need to tell myself to justify weed as a reward and an “end” to the day. When I don’t have a ton of obligations it even starts my day...

It’s just about every other day that I inhale a bong rip while telling myself ok - today’s the last day

I disappoint myself over and over again. 

So today, I’m trying again. I’m not sure what it is about today, but I want to wake up and look forward to the day. I want energy. I want passion. I want to FEEL things (I think). 

I’ve tried doing it for myself... seems like I’m not important enough to me to follow through. So today I’m doing it not for me, but for my wife and my 3 month old son. They deserve all of me, not just my stoned shell.. 

Strategies:
Daily writing and vlog - even if just a sentence, or 5 seconds of staring at myself in the mirror. Eating more than 1 meal per day. Drinking a lot of water.

When I get a craving I will choose an alternative activity:
Kiss/ hug my wife and son (every time)
Read my journal and watch my vlog videos
Go walk the garden and pull weeds, prune fruits/ veggies 
Work on a garden project even if for only a few minutes
Do some push-ups, dips, sit-ups
Write an entry in my journal or take a video
5 min Mindfulness meditation

Then 6 years ago I said goodbye to the legal painkillers (which worked against the pain but will mentally fuck you up) and started my weed journey. What a bliss, depression down, pain tolerance went up, it didnt make me mental anymore and the side effects were eating well, sleeping well and giggling.

And what exactly is normal? It’s easy to forget after 12+ years of chronic use.

But now I remember.

It’s not groggy mornings. It’s waking up to a natural energy buzz .

It’s not mumbling and fumbling through the day. It’s making eye contact, speaking concisely, and genuine confidence.

It’s not impatiently waiting for the next toke. It’s living in the moment and focusing on what’s in front of you. 

Normal is nice.

This community got me to four months sober and kept me motivated every step of the way. However, i am still struggling with a few things and need advice.

I (21F) started smoking freshman year of college and it quickly became an everyday/every moment thing. Junior year I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. It took me until first semester Senior year to realize it was the flower and i needed to stop. I stopped on October 17th and slowly, my medication started working (it previously wasn’t because of how much i was smoking). It was the hardest moments of my life but now I can wake up everyday with a zest for life and actually feel normal. I haven’t had any severe anxiety in months which has transformed my life. 

But this issue is I made smoking my life, my personality, everything. People know me as the stoner. I’m that girl who has a joint wherever she goes. I’m the sole owner of 3 huge bongs at my college house. I also crave it so much now that i’m not experiencing any adverse affects. I dream about smoking and being high it’s crazy. I miss it like hell.

Now last semester was hard but i still didn’t smoke and I am proud of myself. Over winter break I was so tempted that i went out and bought ~alternative flower~. it was a nice alternative but i didn’t get high. I still viewed it as better than ripping an actual joint.

Now as I drive back up for my last semester in college, I’m thinking. Can flower be something I smoke sometimes? Like when I am partying (that’s when i miss it the most)? Or is it really just going to be a one way street back to anxiety and depression? I struggle with this so much and feel like i should “just try it out” and see how it works for me. My therapist says otherwise.

This community has become my lifeline and I am extremely proud of everyone here. I really do admire you all. It took me a lot of courage to make this first post and I really look forward to reading your advice. Thanks guys ❤️",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5988702}"

A little backstory, I’ve been trying to quit for a while because I used to struggle with binge eating in the past and I thought I moved on until I started smoking again. Everything was fine for about 6 months but then I started getting to a point where I was smoking almost as an excuse to binge if that makes sense. It has gotten completely out of control, definitely has added on unwanted weight and I know that I have no other choice but to quit for my own health. Not only that but i tried “moderation” and i always end up smoking way to much, then i eat my weight in food and pass out only to wake up sick and groggy the next day. It has become a continuous cycle that I felt like I was trapped in. I am normally a healthy active person but in the last year weed has been getting in the way of my health and i have done some serious damage to my gut from all the over eating (constant upset stomach, bloated, you know how it goes), while I still go to the gym my diet is horrible and I feel like I am suffering from gut issues due to all of the terrible sugary fatty foods I eat every time I smoke. I basically eat healthy all day and then I get home from work, smoke and eat insane amount of foods and spend insane amounts of money on delivery apps because weed also gives me the “fuck it’s”. What was once a fun way to let loose has now become my complete downfall and i know that i have to stop completely. The other issue i have is that my boyfriend is a very avid weed smoker, he smokes every single day and has no intentions on stopping bc he feels as though in his case it helps with his severe anxiety (he has a medical marijuana card). He does not try to influence me to smoke and he encourages me to stop bc he knows how it has been affecting me and causing me to be depressed about how I’ve been treating my body but it’s still very hard when it is always in reach if i slip up. Fast forward to now (5 days no weed), i’m starting to feel like myself again. I’m not sluggish, my diet has done a complete 360 and I have been waking up feeling more refreshed so this only proves to me the smoking has to stop. I don’t wanna stop now I wanna keep going but I’m starting to notice that when I’m hanging out watching tv or lounging, i get anxiety bc that is normally when i would smoke (Smoking and watching movies was my favorite thing to do). The anxiety I’m feeling is unsettling bc i feel like part of it is bc I’m not used to just being sober anymore. For the past year I’ve basically been high from the second I get home from work to when I wake up, every single day. I don’t want to be someone who can’t just be sober I wanna be able to hang out without needing to smoke which is why I’m not going to give up now bc I know this will pass. It’s not enjoyable anymore because I have realized that deep down I know I’m doing it just to escape and that is not a good feeling. If you’ve read this far, thank you for helping me on my journey.

Now what?,"I’ve spent the last 4 years trying to quite smoking weed. I spent a lot of time evaluating what it was that drove me to smoke weed and recently i finally figured it out. I’m an adventurous person. I like to see the world, meet new people, form new connections and discover things. I’ve also always been one to set big goals (the kind that require lots of patience). Many of those goals have been accomplished and in so doing, I’ve gained loads of skillsets and knowledge, so i don’t regret any of it. But During the times where I’m unable to explore/discovery due to financial or time constraints, i find myself restless and frustrated. This is where weed comes in. It makes the passage of time more bearable (dare i say, enjoyable) until i can afford to embark on my next adventure. Now that I’ve realized my root cause for smoking weed, the enchantment that weed once had is fading each time i smoke. I even find myself becoming angry when i consider weed as a remedy for my restlessness. In the past 22 days, I’ve smoked 3 joints. That’s a major decrease in my normal consumption of 1-2 joints a day. The cravings show up less and less, and when they do, they’re quickly overshadowed by the frustration that follows due to the fact that I’ve realized it’s only a distraction from what i actually want in life. The problem now is that I’m always frustrated. I spend hours a day irritated at the fact that I’m not exploring something new. I’m tired of learning things via the internet, books, lectures and secondhand accounts. I want to gain experiences firsthand, but with this stupid pandemic, We’re pretty much confined to our homes.

I'm now a bit over 9 months clean, after 9 years of heavy daily smoking. At times it's been good, others not so much, but I'm pulling through.

One thing that is really bothering me is I'm facing strong creative blocks, which is problematic for me as I'm in my mid 20s trying to build my own path in visual arts. I sometimes have spurts of random creative weeks, filled with ideas, but mostly I'm just completely dry. I can't afford to have one creative week and then 3 months of nothingness.

I wonder if my mind is a bit more stuck now, being used to smoke and let the mind wander. But now that I'm clean I'm struggling to think outside of the box and let thoughts and ideas flow. I've even considered smoking every now and then because of this, but I don't want to cause I know it would be disastrous and I also want to learn how to access my creativity without relying on substances.

Here's 5 ideas you could do RIGHT NOW,"1 hum, sing, say something, tell yourself a joke, laugh at yourself, yell. In some way, just express yourself - just get out of your head for a sec! I've found even singing a couple bars can snap me out of my spiralling dooming.

2 read something not on your phone. Anything. Pick up a book, maybe even some poetry. Read for 5 or 10 minutes if you can manage. Feel your breathing change with your attention shifting.

3 if you can, leave the house for half an hour. Maybe go somewhere with tactile sensing - is there a park with leaves you can crush or even scented trees? What about a building with a good texture? 

4 get a recipe and make something. Ideally an old favourite from the before times. Don't have the ingredients? Even better, head to the shops. Buy a tasty treat while you're there. 

5 shoot up a post and let us catch you. Someone has been my support without even knowing it before. We don't want you to fall.

Now if you're still reading and thinking well that's all fine for that guy, but I really need a smoke - that's OK, no hard feelings. We're all on our journeys. It won't cost you much time to try one though, if you want to humour a random stranger on the net. In my experience, you're never quitting forever, you're only ever quitting in each moment. You need to help yourself now, and I have found that even momentary breaks from my internal monologues (mostly about how getting high will solve things) can remind myself of what I actually want (mostly not getting high, and also cake).

Day 5 here, second serious attempt to quit in 6 months. I learnt a lot from last time and while I'm frustrated that I didn't follow through then, I'm grateful that those lessons are still valuable this time around. For context, I've been a chronic of chronic tokers for over 10 years.

As my profile will show, this isn't my first rodeo with trying to quit, or my first time posting a streak here on /r/leaves. 

I don't honestly know what made this time different or why I am better able to stick with it, but I just feel more motivated and able this time.

However, some reflections that I am gathering from this (more successful) attempt vs previous ones:

* If I keep trying I will eventually get there. Sure I have failed at sticking to it before, but trying is the first step of succeeding.

* Don't expect all the positive changes that people describe on here to be anywhere near instant, and don't let it be to demonitivating if you don't see a change. 

For me it was the clearing of mind-fog that people described, I never experienced it in my previous attempts, and it demotivated me. 

However, this time I think I am experiencing it. To be honest, I don't even know if it's just getting of the devils lettuce, or if it's the fact that I am taking the time to cook and eat healthier, waking up and going to bed at normal times, or spending more time on my work, but they seam to go together because:

* OMG, there is so much more time in the day when you don't spend it munging out!

Both times in the past that I’ve quit, I’ve quit with no problem at all really, however this time I am having a complete breakdown? I would agree that my use this time round has been heavier and more of an emotional crutch than before. 

My mental health has fallen to bits and I’m getting flashbacks of a certain event which is a reason I started smoking again. I’m living every day on anxiety, I haven’t eaten a meal in a week, I’m down 10lbs. I’m constantly dizzy, hot and cold sweats, shaky, I can’t sleep. Every night feels like I have laid there with my eyes shut until the alarm goes off again. I’m sitting here saying to myself, I can’t do this, I can’t live like this

It was my vice because my life is shitty and really fucking hard and I smoked it because it helped block out all the mental health shit that’s too overwhelming to deal with alone. I’ve done my years of therapies, pills, self helps, etc. Some things hurt forever and I decided to bury them under smoke. 

I have tried addressing my MH properly again since this mental relapse but I’m getting nowhere. My old psychiatrist did tell me to smoke if I was in crisis and it was going to keep me safe/‘here’ which I think was completely irresponsible and has absolutely led me to being here now. After that she discharged me from the MH team a day after I rang the crisis line. Not relevant but wow right?

Basically I need to know when this is going to stop because I am just breaking down at random - at anything or nothing - I’m trying all I can to make myself better and do the things that help.

Now I am 7 months sober with 1 exception. I smoked a joint 1 month after my sobriety just to see what weed actually feels like sober - without my incredible tolerance. Spoiler alert, it felt like shit. I didn't realize how heavily my weed tolerance affected the feeling of weed and the high. Having no tolerance, weed wasn't the comfort blanket I remember it being.

Some days, I feel like smoking. Not returning back to the stoner lifestyle, but just smoking casually. Weed is legal here in Canada, and many people smoke casually. But I don't because I know it won't feel the same as the weed feeling I loved before when I was on the 6-year daily grind. 

I think back to how bad the withdrawal symptoms were from quitting weed and know I can't go back and build my tolerance because the withdrawal is NOT worth the reward. But it feels sad.

All I could witness was whole body relaxation, Feeling like gravity doesn't apply to me , lightheaded, and altered sensation
That's all ,I don't even feel good because I have abused dopamine and serotonin receptors a lot with large doses.
After witnessing the desired effect,it's like why the fuck should I obsess myself with it, I don't actually want to experience it  , Have a habit of it, create a comfort zone out of it, have delusional thinking about it. I can have a relationship with marijuana like a friend, But the habitual use of it darkens the awareness and lucidity of it. I was caught in the loop of thinking and feeling that The problem is with substance, Marijuana is evil and an enemy, it have dimmed every aspect of my life , and I am powerless over it during the moment of craving , because of the way my brain chemistry have adapted with heavy stress and strain of thc, it is predetermined for me to relapse and I will be powerless over the cravings in that canvas of consciousness But it's possible to be powerful over  the craving with intelligence and witnessing whole mechanical neuroscience of cravings and addiction , how automatic it is .It is the path of awareness, alertness, love and you will never decide to relapse over intense craving 
Let that craving be servant and you, the awareness of it be king , There is that space of freedom to choose, But it needs conscious effort  , But if there will not be mental quietness than you will be predestined to relapse with that intense brain and emotional chemistry to go along in that merry-go-round.

I guess the good thing is that I didn't feel the need to smoke weed like I thought I would. Just feeling really unmotivated, but I have to get through this. I guess I didn't give much background in my first post, but I am currently a college student in my last year. I am graduating a year early so that I can save money and try to get into law school this year (although most likely I will have to wait till next year to get in). I worked hard throughout highschool and stayed away from drugs and alcohol. It didn't interest me at the time and I was too focused on getting into college to really pay attention to it. My first year in college was the same, but it was my second year where I started to get interested and got my hands on some weed. I think the most terrifying thing about it is how easily it gives you a false sense of ease and safety. I started off with only using it on the weekends. It then turned to weekdays and then soon I was using it everyday the second I woke up. On top of that, weed has never hurt me academically or socially so it makes you think that you are in control of your life when you really aren't. That's the hardest part about this drug. It's so hard to tell when you are addicted to it and how it's affecting your life. With other drugs or alcohol, there are literal physical affects that give you a sign, but with weed it's almost like you have to find out what is wrong with yourself once you start doing it. I realized that although there are no visible affects that weed has impacted my life in a negative way, it sure has made me okay with where I am at in life and that is when I found out what the problem with this drug was. Weed was taking away the opportunity and motivation that I had before using the drug. All the long nights of working my ass off so that I can get more opportunities was fading away because of this useless drug that was making me settle for mediocrity. That is why I need to stop using this drug and have decided to give my full dedication to this task. I noticed that typing here has also helped in giving me a sense of relief and place of comfort.

For about two years I drank to my detriment nightly, ramped up my nicotine habit to a pack a day, and took cannabis and other drugs wherever they were given by friends, coworkers, and my partner at the time.

My drinking had tapered off significantly while my nicotine and thc habits were always on-and-off. A lot of difficult domestic and personal stuff came out of nowhere in those first months. Plus, being stuck at home and wary of returning to my profession too quickly, I ended up coping by smoking up every few nights, usually with my SO. Then it was every night, sometimes alone. Then it was 2-3 times a day, frequently alone and chainsmoking camels while I was at it. A fellow stoner friend of mine became a roommate around this time, and my use increased further as we spent more time together and tolerance increased. I knew it wasn't ideal, but kept making excuses for myself, such as:

""I'm young, I've got some time to be a little self destructive.""

""My SO hasn't said anything directly, he'd be honest if this were a problem.""

""At least I'm not hungover every morning, I'm better than I *was*.""

""I'm just medicating my mental illness because times are tough, this is good for me.""

And so on and so forth. This pretty much continued from the first days of lockdown until I started to creep towards being honest with myself within the last six-ish months. The drinks were the first to go. I had lost the taste for it with bars closed and wanted to be more considerate of friends who had won tough battles with alcohol addiction. After waffling between vapes and acoustic cigarettes for a few years, I put my foot down mid-December and dropped all nicotine cold turkey to surprising success.

I came down with a cold a couple of weeks ago as I approached a month nic free. It really was just a cold, but for the three days I was getting over it (thus not up to smoking pot) I realized that I couldn't entertain myself at ALL. Reading hurt my head. Tv was boring. I couldn't get the hang of a new video game. All my gross sick coughs still tasted slightly of resin. I felt uncharacteristically moody, tired, and asocial even as I recovered. When I finally felt well again, first thing I did was roll up a big ol' j, smoke it all in one go, and...

nothing. I felt nothing. I couldn't even get high after three days of abstinence and coughed like a mf. I decided I needed *at least* a month off, so I downloaded Grounded and started lurking here when the cravings would set in. In that brief time, I've come to some difficult conclusions about my habits that made me switch from taking a break to giving it up.

I may be young, but ""now"" is always the best time to stop being self destructive. Are those first lines on my face the lines of a smoker? Is that what I want to age into?

My SO has been worried about me this whole time, just very gentle about it. He has remarked on how much more like myself I've been as of late, as if the person he loved went on vacation and just now returned.

I never actually kicked the consequences of my addictive habits, I just switched out my alcohol hangovers for a pot brain fog and believed that was my new and improved normal.

I thought I was medicating my mental illness, but many of my symptoms, such as anhedonia and loss of appetite, were definitely worsening from neglect these past two years (and became very apparent when experiencing withdrawals during dry spells.)

There's a lot of other stuff, but the point is I've had to look in the mirror and actually ask what I'm making all these excuses for. I quit drinking, I quit tobacco, surely I can do this for myself too. And so far, I've been right! I'm done giving away my personal power to stuff that wastes my money, my time, and all the chances I've had to better myself. Seeing other people's stories on r/leaves about finding strength they didn't know was there has been very encouraging, so I wanted to share my story in kind.

2022-01-20 15:02:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/s8rmub/new_life/,New Life,"Hey guys. First off- I feel like I would be doing a disservice to this wonderful sub , and it’s inhabitants if I didn’t generally say- thank you for all your insight, and for providing a place to vent/cope when quitting MJ.

I’ve been smoking since I was 17 years old- Used to smoke cigs too but decided 10 years ago that I would “instead” choose weed. A once-in-a-while recreational activity compounded and became a daily, weekly, monthly yearly habit ever since. Multiple times a day. I’m 31 years old now.


I have tried to quit numerous times, and I feel connected with so many individuals here who share the obvious and not so obvious withdrawal symptoms, all I can do is just trust the process of quitting, and see how much better I’ll feel in time.

A quote I’ve seen on here numerous times has been resonating with me :
“When I’m sober , I wish I was High. When I’m high, I wish I was sober.”

THAT paradox fucking sucks. 

In the last 10 years the most I’ve been able to go without ultimately caving is 1 month. I distinctly remember significant changes in energy, application of self, and decreased anxiety. I can’t pinpoint it- but somewhere along the way a REALLY strong , almost off-putting high (that I remember disliking at that point) somehow snowballed into smoking daily again.  


My wife and I are expecting our first child . This is heavily weighing on my conscience- but in a positive way. I am ultimately telling myself there’s a reason I feel this instinctual drive to stop this habit and redirect my love , finance , and attention to it towards my wife and family.


If I’m being honest - MJ has more downsides to me than I thought , especially in regards to hobbies/ interests/motivation/ relationships.
I used to absolutely adore playing video games. Smoking initially made it “ so much “ better. Now If i get stoned and try to play a game on console , I recognize how often and clumsily I navigate through menus, controller config. I feel dumb playing a single player game, and multiplayer games seem entirely more difficult for me. When did that happen?

I have ADHD and i’ve been told 10000 times that it makes it worse, yet I continued to do it. I’d feel anxious , smoke , get more anxious.

I’d get high, wander aimlessly around my apartment - looking for something to do , while also dissuading myself from doing anything I love. Just didn’t feel like doing anything. 

Irresponsibly, smoking and driving - initially felt fine and as I’m getting older not only do I recognize the stupidity and danger, I recognize the physical impact it has on my driving.Once again, something I will never do with my child in the car. It has to stop regardless.

This is Day 1, and my significant reasons for giving into smoking again in the past were straight up: horrible nightmares , night sweats, no appetite. I think these things can finally be overcome, with much more important things on my plate now.


I’m worried about being irritable and bored, but at this point it’s time.


If you read this, thanks. 


Will be in touch

I just wanted to put a post out there to let people know that after 20+ years of daily smoking I have finally recovered my ability to regulate my emotions without weed - it happened at around 250 days after quitting and has been improving ever since.  

I recently had to deal with some serious bullshit, and how I handled it was very different from how I would have handled it a year ago.  

I've also been dealing with ongoing minor bullshit, and I'm noticing I'm able to process it much better and extract myself from taking on anybody's toxic crap.  

Not only has my basic ability to deal with emotions returned, but dare I say I have experienced some personal growth?  

My self-talk has actually changed quite a bit.  It's hard to describe but basically its making me more aware of when I am having feelings and allowing me to understand why I am having those feelings.  

I think the most noticeable thing has been how I'm handling anxiety.  I can feel the onset of it right away and immediately talk myself through what is happening, why it is happening, and determine what I need to do until it passes and thereafter to ensure I'm acting in my best interests.  

For the longest time I never even wanted to quit, I loved weed.

There's been more benefits than I thought there would be, so all the pain from those early days of quitting was definitely worth it.

Some days I just feel like I need the thing, I can't remember the last time I spend more than a day without supply.
But here's the thing: I see a lot of people describing their relationship to weed in kind of a toxic manner. Like they get depressed, or forgetful or just improductive. The problem in my case is that I seem to work the other way. No matter what I'm doing, is 100% better if I'm smoking. Though meet at work? Burn one. Too much work too little time? Burn one. Movie? Burn one. Concert? Burn one. Before eating, before sleeping, you get the gist. So I really don't want to just stop weed, I actually helps me a lot with a number of things my anxiety just makes harder. however, I have completely lost any kind of control over quantity and frequency. Do you think there's a way to go back to the moderate use days or am I just fooling myself?",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5066575}"

2022-01-20 05:29:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/s8g07o/3_days_free/,3 days free.,"As i write this, Im almost awestruck as to how Ive managed to, in a single moment, gain the mental fortitude to be able to pull off quitting, and nofap. Not my only bad habits, but definetly the worst for me. Porn had rotted my brain, always artifically stimulating myself and combining that with the effects from cannabis, over a period of four months. I worked myself into the biggest mess of my life.

Even while greiving family, pets and a general loss of enthusiasm towards my life have been battering my headspace, I remained strong. Went though it. There is a long way to go, but I am FINALLY at the point where I can say Im done with being that person. I am a week and a half free from both of the worst habits in my life and Im extremely proud of myself. 

One big help, has been steam baths. Running a really hot bath, and having the mental strength to keep yourself in, around it sweating and detoxing. The heat is hard to deal with after a while and you should start really sweating it out.

Another thing that I think goes underlooked, is the fact we have an endocannabanoid system inside us, wether we smoke or not. It must, to the sober, just work like clockwork. For the smokers, it seems to require a ""top up"", and this feeling goes on for a long time. We are repairing, and we have to give as much patience as possible. I havent quit since I was 18 for more than 6 months, but I really feel like I can put the joint down and feel far better about doing things in reality.

Ive been running, reading, spending time with family and friends. Alot of peoples vice's are nighttime for sleep etc. Ive been working night shifts, so when the sleep comes in the morning, its much easier. At least for this first week. I cant do much of what I want to do being a stoner (Learning investing, Travelling etc.)

Last night was a turning point. As I sat there, I studied my thoughts, feelings, emotions and the general process of my mind working. It was extremely negative, there was so much self doubt and paranoia built up, that I assumed it wouldnt take a few hours to start actually fighting back against my mind. I did it. I came out the end of a 9 hour shift, having relearnt selfworth, selffulfillment and my principles. I feel far more emotionally capable, and it was completely unexpected. Ive felt so fucking weak these years, and hidden myself away to compensate. It always catches up.

I had attatched my self worth to another human being, to most other human beings in my life. Always scared to be different, to break out and do something different, say something different. Im 24, and these lessons have came at the perfect time as always. I refuse to allow myself next time a romantic relationship comes my way, to sit in any self doubt, paranoia of my partner, always making sure I could be there for everyone but myself. That was the whole avoidance mindset, after 3 years of doubling down constantly I see how my brain has been conditioned, to believe almost automatically I am ""worse"" than another human being. Insecurities shone through me. Pain and misery showed at the surface level constantly. My whole energy has changed in a night.

I refuse to delve further into negative emotions than necessary, I refuse to waste this short sweet life, and I refuse to allow anyone to ever make me put anyone  before myself while I am healing. I am a powerful and divine being, and havent fucked everything up at least. I have managed to save far more money than I ever could before, I have an extremely supportive family and I have the ability to do whatever I want to do in the coming months and years. 

I work in healthcare. I was with a lady who was dying. It was 4am, I did my usual checks, and she opened her hand to me, so I held her hand and just watched as she squeezed so hard, until her weakness took over. She fell asleep like that. I did this a few times throughout, beyond feeling so much energy and empathy for this woman in that moment. 

That wouldnt have happened with cannabis flooding my system. No emotional intelligence, strength or fortitude of principles to allow me to finally stop, and think about how simple life can be. You have to do what you have to do, and the universe will take care of the rest.

I promise to love myself each day until my last, and as cannabis is harming me every time, Its a no brainer.

It also is important mention I’m YOUNG. So I never felt addicted. I always finished my school work before I did it. Room was clean. I have straight this year. Also interesting to mention it’s the only year I have straight As but also because junior year is the most important year. So basically I never thought anything of it. Leaving it. I even took tests with it and got As. Also I’m in all APs and Honors classes. I felt like it honestly made me more productive because I made sure to everything before I did it. Like I had free time.  Anyway midterms were coming up so I thought I’d take a week break. So my tolerance would go to zero and I’d take a double blinker once I got back but once I felt withdrawal I realized I never want to do this again. It wasn’t hard at all. Until I tried going to sleep. Nothing. I tried everything. At first I thought maybe I was hungry. Nothing still couldn’t go to sleep. Than I thought it was because I had anxiety for midterms. But Then something happened. I calmed myself down no racing thoughts and I ate food and felt genuinely full. So I searched online if there are symptoms of withdrawal. Even though I was sad I had insomnia I was happy I found out the reason. Happily though I already peaked I think. So now the only symptom I have left is insomnia and it could be worse. I sleep one day and not the next. This is still really hard for me especially as a student. It’s been 5 days but I don’t know how much more I can take of this. I just thought I’d share my story for two reasons. My withdrawal was so bad and I only smoked everyday for two weeks. The thing is carts are probably worse for withdrawal because it’s so potent. Anyway I just thought I’d share my story because I took my midterm with no sleep and not only passed but definitely got at least a B.

I can sustain boring stuff for longer! Longer studying session, doing house chores, so much stuff!

Long story short, I was actually using Cannabis medicinally. But like any medication, it can be abused and lead to full blown addiction, which happened. I have PTSD, Bipolar Disorder, and ADHD, and GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) all of which I was self medicating with MJ.

I know, I’m a mess. 😂
Being that these mental health issues have been so severe, i’ve struggled to maintain stability in my life. Pile a severe, full blown Cannabis addiction on top of that and I’m sure you can see why I’m always broke and neglecting important responsibilities. I’m addicted to the escapism that comes with using Cannabis. It’s been so severe I always seek to disassociate from reality, and trauma. It’s ruined my spirituality, and distanced me from God more than I’d like to, and EVERYTIME that happens my life goes to shit. I don’t even have a therapist anymore, and have not went over DBT (or any clinical methods of treating my diagnoses) in a while. I don’t have a car so I cannot attend NA meetings regularly. 

If you’re religious, I ask y’all to fr fr keep me in your prayers, (I strongly believe in the power of prayer) and if you’re not, I just ask for extra support, encouragement, and positivity. I feel so alone but this subreddit really helps with that.

Quit because I missed a couple job opportunities and wasted a lot of money, but the extremely severe side effects from the shitty impurity laden gas station carts I was hitting were a strong encouragement (splitting headaches and nausea if I didn't smoke for like 6 hours, GI disturbances, visual hallucinations [not the cool kind, stuff like flashes of shadow people standing over my bed at night]). Eventually I figured if cutting back was gonna make me feel this bad I might as well just go cold turkey. I was also starting a job soon after being unemployed for a while so I assumed it was best to get withdrawal out of the way. 

The worst withdrawal symptom was the nausea, and for a couple days it was really hard to even keep down water, but that was basically gone after a week along with any brain fog or dysphoria. After that the main issue was insomnia – I spent a 72 hour period basically sleepless and pretty much just playing call of duty – which cleared up in about two weeks. Then it was pretty much just night sweats (smelled awful, could not get away with not showering) and vivid nightmares, both of which I'm still getting occasionally, but they've gotten much better. 

I'm pretty much out of withdrawal finally and have very little desire to smoke yet, which surprises me. I'm kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop, but I'll just keep trucking either way I guess.

One very strange symptom that has always bothered me is the sensation of dry mouth/throat that is also accompanied with an abundance of saliva. I find myself constantly swallowing & when I do I can feel just how dry my throat & tongue are. This is honestly the biggest factor in me deciding to smoke again even though after smoking I can still feel the cottonmouth however its much easier to handle due to me being high and paying it no mind. I've heard of it being remnants of THC in your system that can cause the dry mouth however I test myself so that I am certain I'm negative before going to work and even when negative these symptoms remain. I am starting to worry that this is simply a biological shortcoming unrelated to cannabis.

Another interesting & weird discovery I made is my body is pretty efficient & pruning out THC. This is likely due to the copious amount of water I intake (only thing other than smoking that gives me a slight/short relief) and the several trips to bathroom I make.

Im currently 3 weeks in quitting cold turkey and this is far from my first attempt. 

My advice to anyone thinking of quitting is to take time to think about why you smoke so you can plan ahead for quitting - is it a coping technique? Is it to numb yourself from something? Is it to cover up bad thoughts and feelings, to try an me escape a trauma or traumatic event?

For me I realised I am a perfectionist, in the sense my quest for perfection has only driven me to near insanity, and I’ve been like this from a really young age. 

Weed massively took the edge of that, it helped me to not care so much. 

With my perfectionism I was also a very serious person, and this did not make for me being popular at school. But I started smoking it at 15 and bam! Suddenly I was actually funny, others found me funny. I could finally be laid back and “cool.”

But like my quest for perfection, weed consumed me. It became my lifestyle, my friendship group revolves around it. My life revolved around it and I could just not go without. I was like that till my late 20s when I took quitting seriously and had some long standing time of quitting, the longest being over 2 years. But I always went back, and once I went back I couldn’t go a day without. Heck, I would smoke morning, noon and night if I could!

But I realised, the serious side of me is the real me! And is also the person I want to be. I’m 35 and I want to be taken seriously. I would rather find like minded people than to smoke to try and fit in with laid back people. I’m not saying I can’t have fun or make a joke, I can. But I’m not a laid back person at heart. And now I want to use this serious side of me to achieve my goals and live my life as it would have been without weed - highly organised and driven. I still have to be mindful of my perfectionism but rather than let it consume me, use it to my advantage. 

I really hope this is my last quitting attempt, though of course I’m taking it a day at a time. But now I’m loving my serious side and getting to know the real me again. 

So, I hope that this advice can help others who are quitting to take some time for self reflection, think about what drives your addiction to weed and put an action plan in place to help you quitting.",24,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49218765}"

I wanna share my journey.,"In fact, I’m on day 112 right now and going strong. I was scared that I was never going to be able to get this far, it took 3 years and I literally quit hundreds and hundreds of times. I felt weak, and like a horrible failure for so long, but with the help of truly amazing friends, a professional counsellor, and my own resilience, I was able to work through all that shame and realize that I am not worthless and addiction is just an exceptionally difficult thing to overcome. After all, why would there be so many addicts and things like rehab centres or people who are addiction counsellors if it was easy? It isn’t. I relapsed over and over and it was crushing. But I just had to keep trying again and again and again. I had to never stop believing in myself and never give up even when I felt like I had nothing left inside. I had to get back up and try again. And then finally it stuck. I did it. 

My previous records were around 30 days a couple times and other than that it was usually just a few days of break at most. I was once a heavy daily user. But before reaching the start of these 112 days I definitely was using much smaller amounts and at smaller frequencies than ever before, and that helped a lot too. Even just smoking a joint or half at once instead of obliterating myself with bowl after bowl of bong hits makes a gigantic difference. It took me a long time to get there too but by the end my tolerance was way lower which was quite a good thing because I literally couldn’t handle big amounts anymore. 

&#x200B;

And I know I gotta stay vigilant and keep on going, I know I’m not just automatically set for life now, and the fight continues on. I’ve literally started walking to the dispensary a few couple these past 112 days and I literally sat myself down on the sidewalk and really really thought about what was doing, turned around and walked home.  For some near relapses I reached out to friends and told them I was considering using if I felt able (but that can be really hard to be honest.) I have made peace with the idea that I can be happy never using weed again for as long as I live. And that’s what I want and need because it hurt me so so much, destroyed me and brought me to one of my absolute lowest points in my life. Took away so much time and happiness and strength, so many moments, opportunities, memories, and so much of my mental well-being. And it hurt other people in my life too.

&#x200B;

Some people can enjoy the drug itself in a safe way but I am not one of them, the addiction is way too dangerous and so damn frightening and powerful. And that’s okay. I don’t need it to be happy. Many times, and more often the farther I made progress in my addiction, it actually felt disgusting, harmful and awful to get high, it nearly immediately made me feel much worse. I cannot express how wonderful it feels to be free, and my life has dramatically changed for the better without it. And if I can do it, literally taking hundreds of times to quit,  you can absolutely do it too. As much as my experience with addiction has hurt me, I do feel like it has absolutely made me stronger. And it’s also served a protective function, it made me able to recognize the signs of addiction immediately when I (very very regretfully) tried other drugs and I was able to avoid going further down that path because I knew, if weed addiction can be this devastating, addiction to another drug would be unimaginable. 

&#x200B;

The main things that helped me:

\-A very strong support network of friends (my family was just detrimental lol)

\-Professional counselling (luckily it was free for me being under 25 in my province but I know it’s not accessible to anyone and that is a serious problem)  

\-Writing down and journaling a lot in regards to my reasons for wanting to quit or stay sober, my progress, how it felt when I was high, my challenges etc.

\-Recognizing that the addiction is extremely insidious and will try to do anything to convince you to use, will try to justify and rationalize the craziest things and being prepared for that. Also being prepared knowing cravings lie ahead in the future even when you feel so ready to quit in the moment. The knowledge that I can be 100% determined to quit but the next day I feel like if I get high again it’s okay, is actually very useful because you’re able to be ready for it. So you have to be willing to stop, re-center yourself and remember why you’re fighting to stay sober, what you truly believe in deep down, how you know you’ll feel like shit if you use, etc. 

\-Finding good ways to distract myself from the urges when they came.  

\-Improving other aspects of my mental health & recovering from depression and anxiety so I had more strength to fight the addiction 

\-Music, especially when I was having a difficult time or thinking of relapsing

\-Being kind to myself, rewarding myself with fun activities and good food 

\-Learning to deal with the fear and feelings of weakness and shame that build up and become so heavy and debilitating over time. I feel like this was one of the biggest roadblocks for me but it was a long and still ongoing process. But those feelings a) don’t make sense because addiction rewires your goddamn brain. Even for a non addictive drug like weed! Relapsing does not make you weak. And b) aren’t helpful and I needed to make peace with them so I could finally recover.

&#x200B;

But I did it. And I’m still doing it. And I’m going to do everything I can do keep on doing it. And worse comes to worst, if I ever do use again, I will get back up and try once again. Because I already know I have the strength I need within me. In fact my best friend once helped me realize that everything I ever need is inside me, over time the addiction feels like this gigantic monster of darkness that looms behind you and is too terrifying and overwhelming to overcome. But in fact, in a way, that monster is simply the past. You don’t have to overcome years of relapses and addictions, no matter how long you’ve been fighting. You only have to overcome the cravings, or battles, ahead of you.

I have what I consider to be anger issues. Weed never made them go away and I would still get irrationally angry in the depths of my addiction but being stoned nerfed everything about me, including my rage. 3 or 4 months ago I was consuming more weed than I had in 27 years of an on again off again habit. When I quit I was confronted head on with my anger like I never had been before. I literally couldn't control myself, snapping at people at work, in the street, at the grocery store. Each time I would walk away, disgusted or stupefied with myself but since I wasn't getting stoned I was forced to contend with it. 

When I was 3 months out from smoking weed and still behaving like this it was honestly discouraging. Who was I to be acting like this? How dare I make everyone around me have to deal with this toxic behavior? It was difficult at the time but these were questions I needed to ask myself. 

I know it could happen again but it's been over a month since my anger has boiled up to such toxic levels. My relationship with my fiance is way more healthy and I'm less afraid that I'm going to be shot in a road rage incident.

Prior to smoking I would swear by never smoking. I hated weed mainly because I was born looking like an average smoker. My eyes are real low and because my eyelids are hooded they look puffy. So I just look high 24/7 and got teased for that reason. This was only made worse by people considering me less intelligent which took a blow to my self esteem. I choose to compensate by dating a lot of people I had no interest in. When doing that I came across someone who wanted me to smoke. We did and now I’m hooked on it like phonics.  I noticed that my morality decreased the more I smoked as well as my interest in socializing. This was after 3 years of resisting smoking around my friends who would smoke whenever we got together.

Because I continued to smoke afterwards I began to use it as a coping mechanism. About a year later I fell for a someone who I was willing to spend my life with. She and I had a falling out and I started to abuse it more.

I found out why I chose to smoke a while ago, and that’s to avoid my problems and ignore reality. 

It’s been about 6 years since I’ve dated her and we met recently as well as I visited my hometown as I no longer live there. A lot has changed since then. I’m not the same person I was then. Because of this people in my hometown, including her gave me flak for it. Just for context I’ve decided to transition from male to female and some inappropriate things were said.

If it had just been that, fine. Im ok with getting some hate, I even expected a little bit. The problem is when I went back everything went wrong that could have. I found out that the girl I was close to and dating had other people she was talking to, that’s fine as we were not exclusive and when confronted about it she blocked me . Not only that but My best friend lost his brother who I was also close to. He assisted me throughout my depression and even helped prevent suicide attempts and tried to help me cope with my depression. 

I just want to move past this stage of my life where I don’t have any control. I don’t want to ignore my responsibilities anymore and I sure don’t want to struggle with having a cloudy mind. I want to be at peace.",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6957896}"

I’ve recently learned that this is because weed reduces the amount of REM sleep you get (the type of deep sleep where your dreams happen). While this may be beneficial for those suffering with traumatic nightmares, it simply reduces the quality of your sleep for those who don’t suffer. 

At approximately 4 months clean, my dreams are vivid, beautiful, exciting places to explore in my sleep. My brain may be making up for lost time because almost every night I’m immersed in a new environment, living real life situations in another world inside my head. I wake up feeling fully rested, no stone-over, just the satisfaction of a night full of dreams. 

Since experiencing cravings in recent weeks, I’ve used my love of dreams returning as my motivation. I just know a slip up will put me back into numb nights of nothingness and that it’s not even worth it. The high I experience from soberness is better than any high I ever got from toking a joint.

I've been working with a counsellor to work on my mental health and work through some of the stuff (read: trauma) I went through as a kid and its made me painfully aware that I am most certainly an addict. Almost 3 full days without using and the urge to get high is quite unbearable at the moment, as is the lack of sleep (I'm sleeping, if I am lucky - about 3-4 hours a night uninterrupted), and the mood swings (god damn, I am irritable). 

Late last evening, I was really struggling - the cravings were quite intense and I took the advice of my counsellor to attend a Marijuana Anonymous (MA) meeting on zoom. Since it's never been easier to find a meeting, it didn't take long to find one and get on, although it was probably one of the more uncomfortable things I've done as of late - I am glad I did. At least right now, its less about the 12 steps and more about community, hearing people talk about their struggles and their journey really gave me a great perspective shift. My goal is to get my addiction under control before it goes over the edge, and I feel that I am dangerously close to going over. 

Cannabis has lost all benefits for me, positive or made-up. I can't convince myself that it brings me any value other then numbing myself to stop feeling - and that isn't what I want anymore. I know it's only day 3 and I got a long way to go but I hope this message helps you on your own journey.

I don't know how to write this post, but I need to express this somewhere. I realize everyone says weed isn't addictive, but to me it is, and I'm realizing how deep my addiction runs. I haven't been sober in 4 years, since a couple months after I left the Army. I've used it as a crutch in every way, my solution for literally everything is to smoke. I quit smoking cigarettes and ended up ramping up my weed smoking rapidly. I smoked through a bitter divorce. I smoked through the death of friends and family. I smoke when I'm happy, I smoke when I'm sad. It's effecting my mental health in a major way. I suffer from depression and anxiety, likely due to a traumatic childhood, and it's amplified when I smoke. While it does make me happy (sometimes) and helps to relieve daily stress, it also puts me in my head. I think too intently on mistakes, I focus on my failures and my depression brain takes over. I tend to go to a dark place and sometimes it leads me to suicidal thoughts. That's probably not the weeds fault, but it often amplifies those feelings. It makes me lazy and I've let myself go into patterns where instead of being productive I just smoke and ignore my problems instead. Every time I smoke I notice all the sensations of my body and go into hypochondriac panic attacks often. I get shortness of breath from the smoke (probably due to constant smoking my entire adult life). Anyway, I don't need to go into every detail, but I'm going to start taking my self care more seriously, and I think for me that starts with experiencing life sober. I'd love to hear feedback from others who have experienced similar things, followed a similar path, or disagree with my sentiment altogether.

Part of me thinks it's detrimental to even keep track of my days sober, simply because I know there's no moderation for me. Like many others here, If I get high one time, I'm done and back to addiction.

I can't even recall how many times I've ""quit"" but this time definitely feels different.

 I've been reflecting today on all the time I've wasted high and how much different the choices I've made throughout these years would have been if I had gotten things under control sooner, but its all water under the bridge, and I'm just grateful to still be relatively young with enough time to make up for these wasted years.

Addiction is one giant trick you're playing on yourself. You're choosing to stay in the same place mentally while everything else around you changes, people disappear, move on, get older, and forget you, while you're stuck in the same comfortable place in your head, even though subconsciously you know you're in hell, until one day you finally wake up from a haze and wonder ""where is everybody""

 I echo the sentiment that being sober won't solve your problems, but it's the first step to actually doing something about them. 

6 months sober after 14 years high, there's hope for a happy life, if you can stay strong enough and sober long enough to repair the damage done.",48,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4632213}"

I'm 30. first got really into weed when I was 18.  since then I've spent a lot of time staying away from it, but also plenty of time high.. it's like I've been battling the addiction the entire time. having periods of loving weed and then realizing I needed to stop. periods of being dependent. I guess I never got to a point where I was truly done.

and maybe I still haven't. but I know I'm not where I want to be in life and this is not the right time to be addicted to something that has the potential to slow me down.  if I quit, worst case scenario I miss out on some of the healing properties that weed has.  if I keep smoking, worst case scenario I miss out on the natural healing and potential of my life without weed.  I finally feel ready to put it down at least for a long long while.

even though I tell myself I use weed to feel and process MORE, the truth is I'm numbing.  it has taken me a long ass time to be honest about that.  it's not easy to say no to a mind altering substance that takes the edge off and makes me feel less alone. but I'm ready to move forward in life and get stronger on my own. living fully.

I don't want to live in a haze.  we only get one life.  I want to see myself achieve my dreams and live to the fullest.

something that's been helping me a LOT is the mantra, just for today I won't smoke. because pretty much every day I get a strong overwhelming desire to smoke.  so I say just for today I won't. just for today I can feel like crap instead. I'll sit with my feelings and give them attention.  I'll take a bath, cook a meal, go outside, or lay in bed if I need to but I won't smoke. because then I'll never know what could have been.

Having a few successful breaks lasting somewhere between 1-4 weeks, I currently find myself at my longest period of time clean from cannabis in over 6 years. This path has been a struggle, with mood swings, night sweats, and extreme lack of motivation included, but I've also gained some feelings of pride, clarity, self understanding, and accomplishment. During this break I have also watched myself lean more heavily into alcohol use, a substance that I've always felt I could take or leave, would use socially on weekends, but never sought out for drinking alone or in excess

Transport to Dec 2021 - what started out as ""normal"" holiday drinking over the first month of my cannabis quitting journey transitioned into seeking out nightly glasses of wine or coolers, something that has brought extreme shame, low mood, and all around negative mental and physical health outcomes. This has honestly frightened me - and I see myself leaning on ""some acceptable substance"" to try to cope with extremely high expectations of academics and work/distressing personal life events, as well as process a pandemic that is now 3 years ongoing (I live in an area that has gone back into the most restrictive level of lockdowns once again). 

I notice myself wanting to have something to shut off the very prevalent stressors that exist in my personal life, and the stressors existing on a much wider scale, for what seems to be an unpredictable ongoing period of time. I feel like I do not want to lean into alcohol any more, but that I do not care to be fully sober - my mind is going in circles about being able to establish some sort of balance/moderation with cannabis to provide the release and ""haze"" - because being clear all the time is something that I'm really not sure I truly want. I don't want to go back to being in a haze or under the influence all the time either, but I don't know how I feel about these extremes.

So i have been reading a lot of posts lately but there is something that i cannot get of my mind right now. I also would like to add that this community is really something special.

M25 that has been smoking for approximately 3 years with barely any breaks in between. I am currently on a 13 day streak yet the boredom is something that makes me wonder whether i can smoke some weed for one day and then stay off again for a while.

To give some context, i am a masters student and currently really struggling with the boredom of covid-19 as there seems to be no good study/ free-time balance and i have the urge to just see and try if moderation works. I also work-out 5-6 times a week and i have never let weed impair that. But the endless cycle of waiting for restrictions to drop to have more of a social life again is hitting me hard today

Since 13 days i have decided to quit and it went quite well, although the sleep is sometimes and bit rough it’s not something that is undoable. I have been smoking only in the evenings as i did not want it to impair my days as i do not really become productive on weed. The effects of not smoking are really beneficial from the 13 days i have been off it. However i Just finished an exam and currently have 9 days until my next deadline. However, i know that i will probably regret it but the urge to just chill for an evening is pretty high. Covid has screwed the student life pretty hard and boredom is definitely there. So now i am sitting at home as per usual and considering if i should just do it for an evening",2,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5433807}"

I don't go out because I have an unvaccinated baby at home and I work remotely so weed has been the only exciting part of my day, which is awful and depressing. I only started smoking heavily during the pandemic and now I feel like its hard to quit. I'm really happy I found this community and I hope I can make it a whole day without smoking.

update: its the end of the day and I didn't smoke! I had so many urges but I didn't.

All initial withdrawal effects are gone - my appetite is back, i can sleep (assuming my cat lets me), night sweats/chills are gone - I am essentially back to ""normal.""


At this point its just fighting off cravings but those cravings are also reminders to why I quit. I'd smoke to make myself ok with doing nothing. Sitting around and playing vidya/watching tv/scrolling my phone? better burn and make it more enjoyable. 


Now when I find myself with ""nothing to do"" I find things to do - gym, errands, clean, self improvement.


I quit cause I wasnt happy with the way my life was going and my smoking made me complacent - it made me ok with not doing anything, it made me ok with being average, it allowed me to accept the status quo as opposed to doing something about it


they say the life you want is right outside your comfort zone and smoking kept me super comfy.


Here is what I did that helped in the initial few weeks and have turned into patterns:
1) drink a ton of water - like literally as much water as humanly possible
2) exercise and work up a sweat daily - run, lift, swim, bike; i don't care but be active.
3) make sure you understand why you are quitting and make sure that's clear and you understand it - you will be revisiting it quite frequently
4) try not to be bored - sitting around doing nothing is like an invitation to cravings - keep yourself busy.


That's really all I got for now. Good luck to all and thanks for the support over these past few weeks.",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.60120827}"

I apologize because this is a bit gross, but I’ve seen posts here from past quitters describing a persistent cough that produces dark-colored phlegm which presumably contains the buildup of smoke residue and dead cells that have accumulated in the respiratory system over the course of your smoking career. 

I’ve been experiencing the same thing, and while it doesn’t bother me all that much (in fact, it weirdly feels kind of good to get this gunk out of my system), it is a bit off-putting, and I was just wondering what kind of timeline I may be looking at before this coughing up of black stuff subsides. For context, I was a daily smoker (of weed only) for about five or six years, mostly using a bong but sticking pretty much exclusively to a vape pen for the last year or so before finally stopping.

I am feeling less motivated, productive and confident but for some reason just feel stuck and am finding it hard to stop. I feel a bit like I am in a slow motion train wreck and am not even sure why I went off the tracks in the first place.

My friend and I would smoke every day- after work, before work, random Tuesday nights, at parties, etc. This was our way of having a good time and really being able to connect and have great conversation during a time of uncertainty. 

Since starting smoking regularly at the beginning of 2020, I have seen many  changes in the way it affects my body. After months of use, I started noticing the influx of anxiety, depression, loneliness, drowsiness, feelings of self doubt and usefulness. 

I want to start by describing the increased amounts of anxiety that is a result of daily smoking. A couple months ago, I was extremely high (surprise) while watching a TV show with my roommates. I noticed my heart began to race, very quickly, out of nowhere. I convinced myself I was having a heart attack and obsessed over the feeling of impending doom for months to come while being high. I have developed severe health anxiety (hypochondria) since then, and am always convincing myself I have a terminal illness whenever I am high- headache? Brain tumor. Anxiety attack? Definitely about to go into cardiac arrest and never wake up. These feelings never persist when I am sober during the day- why haven’t I stopped???! 

The answer to that is simple- I go through a constant cycle of wanting to quit, stopping for a day, and going right back to it when I’m bored. I’ll be sitting alone in my living room, back a bowl, and throw on some YouTube for 3 hours before it’s bed time. You’d think I’d see that as a terrible way to live considering the symptoms I’ve described above. And I’m just now realizing that. 

I am definitely rambling here but I also want to touch on the effects this drug has on my during every day life. I have lost all abilities to socialize. My brain feels fried all the time, unless I go a couple days without smoking, but then I just ruin it again. I have no motivation to succeed in my career, go on dates, make new friends, socialize a normal amount, anything. 

Today is the day I’ve decided I’m not going to live like that anymore. It is going to be difficult to quit, but I am determined to become the person I was before I became a daily smoker. If anyone can relate to any of the side effects above or my story in general, please let me know as I could use all the support I can get during this.",4,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6270285}"

There's a lot of great supportive people on here, inspirational posts but reading this subreddit can be negative influence sometimes. I can't help but take what other people say to heart and a lot of people are really hard on themselves for smoking weed. There's a balance between admitting we made a mistake and hating ourselves for it. 

It's healthy to see things for what they are and take accountability that we made bad decisions. It's good to take ownership and accountability but that can easily cross over into self abuse and judging yourself as weed ""ruined your life."" Even if that is true in my case I'm not interested in wasting any more time and energy beating myself for smoking weed. I'm a human being that made mistakes, not some piece of shit loser like my feelings tell me I am sometimes.

We all have our reasons for smoking: we're addicts, we're self medicating, peer pressure... whatever. At the end of the day we made the decision to smoke, and keep smoking. Maybe smoking weed had its purpose and kept you from being an alcoholic or doing hard drugs... or in my case suicide. I'm writing this post because I need to acknowledge that time spent ruminating on past mistakes and judging myself is time I could be spending exercising, working on my career, learning, meditating ... the shit we avoided doing getting high.

I just wanna move on with my life, embrace the discomfort of dealing with my emotional issues that I used weed to mask.

So long story short : im a 36yo man that's been smoking for 20+ years, switched to oil a few years ago and since Ive dropped weed entirely, just dabbing \~200mg per day.

Stopping has become more and more obvious with getting older, it wasn't even fun getting high anymore and it was more of a waste of time/money... and health !

So last sunday I decided I would stop and took my last dab. Ive clean and put all my stuff away so I don't see it around me.

So far it's been ok. Im feeling shaky from time to time, defintly more nervous and anxious then usual... But I feel also very motivated, even euphoric at times ! Physicaly im very gassy, bloated yet can't eat much.. Also sweaty but cold at the same time, the usual withdrawal stuff you could say !  
Was so scared for that first night but it went pretty good, I slept and didn't dream too much.

Now, what should I expect in the coming days ? Am I already getting better by the hour or am I just a fool for thinking that ? Im scared I might get worst and worst and the coming days and that bugs me !

Lol you could say I was expecting worst then that for my first 48h sober, but maybe im not out of the woods yet... I don't even know !

A little over two months ago, I decided that I was going to completely quit smoking after doing so just about every day for 3 years (though usually not much during the day). At this time, I was away at college, missing my family and really suffering from having to spend so much time with myself, and started smoking more to evade having to spend too much time within my own head. This was a short-lived idea, as smoking began to make me more and more anxious, to the point I was having terrible panic attacks, and at this point, I made the decision to quit. 

Since then, I have gone through the ringer in terms of having the withdrawal symptoms, DP/DR, terrible anxiety, lightheadedness, nausea, etc. However, there is light on the other end of the tunnel. At this time, I started reading a book named Peace From Nervous Suffering, a book by Claire Weekes, where she details conquering the physical sides of anxiety. From talking to my therapist, and my now psychiatrist, I feel that much of what I have been dealing with on the physical side was my body trying to tell me something, to communicate the message of the way that I have been living my life is not working. All in all, I felt uncomfortable in my own body, and being out in public, or by myself, would cause these symptoms to additionally flare up, making everything worse. On the other hand, I would often get extremely depressed and hopeless, searching the internet over and over wondering what is wrong with me, what I can do to get passed this, and so on. 

On that topic, though, the fix is easy. It's all about not letting these sensations dictate how you're going to live your life, and not giving in to the fear of doing so, same goes with wanting to return to smoking weed. These are just anxious thoughts of your body trying to make you do something that makes you feel comforted but living in a world where you feel that you cannot do anything but the bare minimum, is not a world that I am terribly attracted to. 

The last few months have been difficult, but I will say, it has all been worth it, and I feel genuinely less anxious, more in control, and happier than I have been in the past, and I will explain things that have helped me do so:

1. Realize that a lot of what you're feeling is fear, your body is not used to this new reality, without marijuana. Things may feel different, but that's not a bad thing unless you view it as such.
2. Do not add additional fear to these feelings, they won't hurt or kill you.
3. Do things that you genuinely enjoy, for me, yoga, running (or going on walks), meditating, drawing, indoor soccer, returning to playing music, video games, cooking, reading, and listening to podcasts have all played a small role in helping me enjoy what life has to offer.
4. Find people who can support you, and you feel comfortable talking to about this journey, this community does a good job of fostering that. :)
5. If there are certain times of the day that you feel worse, turn those situations into a more positive ritual. For me, morning and evenings were the most difficult, so in the mornings I have developed a ritual of meditating, having a cup of tea, going on a walk, taking a shower, or something positive to start off the day. At night, I like to turn my phone/computer off and read for an hour. 
6. If there are things that worry you, journaling or talking about them out loud to yourself have been extremely helpful to me.
7. Put things in perspective, realize that life is worth living, and that things can be positive if you make them such, I struggle a lot with being a worst-case-scenario kind of person, but if you begin to see the good, you continue to see the good.
8. Realize that there will be ups and downs, you're not going to feel awesome every day, you're human, and that's not normal. Sometimes it will be harder than others, and that's okay, be more kind to yourself.
9. Lastly, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, develop a sense of self-compassion, and enjoy being with yourself. Do not be hard on yourself if you relapse, or for what you have done in the past, you are on a good path now, and making this decision is an extremely difficult one, every road has bumps.

Got on a medication for anxiety & depression about two months ago and it hasn't done much for me. For months, in the back of my mind, as I was smoking weed just to get through work or just to feel social or just because I *saw* my dab pen on my desk and the compulsive need flared up- I knew I had a problem. 

I tried to make it my new years resolution and immediately failed. I tried to stick to bud only (dab pen makes it too convenient) and immediately failed. I even had serotonin syndrome once (mild case, google if you're unaware, it.. was definitely the worst night of my life.) as a result of heavy usage but it wasn't enough to make me quit. Then last night happened. 

Went out to smoke as usual. Came back in and I felt off. Went to the bathroom to wash up before bed and immediately started hyperventilating. Weed has never freaked me out before, I'm very good at controlling panic attacks. But soon I was covered in sweat and pale and I knew I needed help, fearing it was serotonin syndrome again (I'd had alcohol & prescription meds earlier too). I got up, stepped into the hallway, shut off the bathroom light behind me, then everything went black. 

When I opened my eyes, I had no idea where I was, who I was. I have a history of substance induced psychosis. I've been here before. I was passed out unconscious on the bathroom floor for 10-15 seconds before opening my eyes, but it felt like hours or days. I absorbed most of the impact in my jaw, which is almost immovably sore today. My wrist and shoulder are busted too. Slowly, my sense of self came back to me, I was able to call for help. But my head missed the edge of the bathtub, the toilet, and a little decorative table by mere inches. Had I hit one of them, especially the tub, this could've been a very different story. 

Woke up today and threw all my weed out. I still have my glass pieces because I don't want to stop forever, but enough is enough. That experience was terrifying. I can't keep pumping myself full of chemicals and expecting them to duke it out and fix me somehow. I'm looking forward to seeing what my prescription meds can do for me once I'm not nuking my brain with weed all the time (California dispo weed, to be clear, and not the cheap shit). My goal is 30 days, at least. I don't want to risk serotonin syndrome again, I don't want to go unconscious because my body's at its limits. I don't want to be anxious and depressed and have no drive to be social. I've been a habitual drug user since I was 13 and I'm 21 now. This is a big step for me and I'm scared, because weed has been a huge crutch, especially during Covid. But I know I can do this, because I know I never want to be where I'm at ever again.

I have taken maybe 5 breaks, ranging from 3 months to 1 year. The first 3-4 years, it seemed harmless. Sure, my memory wasn't as sharp but it was still fun.

&#x200B;

After I turned 18, I started realizing I was over-staying my visit. It was no longer a social activity, I started preferring to smoke alone. I started feeling more distant and melancholy, where weed would only give me temporary relief from these feelings. I also started to realize that it was preventing me from reaching my potential, which bothered me. I was still able to graduate college, and more or less live a normal life. Deep down I always knew that I wanted to leave a mark on this world, and it bothered me that I wasn't on the trajectory to do that.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 110 days ago, I took on NoFap. NoFap gave me more motivation, increased my libido, and even made my vision more clear. It made my emotions much stronger and as time went on, smoking became very anxiety inducing. I would smoke half as much as before and feel way higher, but I would feel a deep sense of dread. I knew it was time to stop.

&#x200B;

74 days ago, I stopped smoking weed. I didn't have many physical withdrawal symptoms, the first few weeks were smooth. I felt great about myself, on top of the world. However, Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms (PAWS) started to set in around the 1 month mark. The symptoms include (for me): anhedonia (lack of joy), brain fog, lack of concentration, lack of will-power, and generally feeling melancholy. These symptoms come in waves, and the waves get less intense as time goes on. I am still experiencing these waves today, and I expect that I will experience them for 1-2 years due to my usage at an early age.

Things have seen so dim lately between covid and wfh, and just everything going on in the world, and there doesnt seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel, i used all of this to justify me buying \*one joint\*. Of course that turned into.. idk even know how many joints and 3 edibles during the next 2 weeks. 

The smoking experience was pretty unremarkable. Smoking has not been enjoyable for me for quite some time, which is why this compulsion to smoke is so confusing to me. I knew before i smoked that i wasn't going to enjoy it, and the truth ended up being that I didn't enjoy it and I didn't not enjoy it... it was just........ something to do. I watched so much tv and ordered so much take out, i actually grossed myself out. 

But more important than the experience are the consequences. Almost immediately after smoking, it started taking a toll on my life. By the end of the two weeks my life was, going to sleep at 3 am, waking up at 2;00 p.m., ordering one meal for the day from door dash that is complete trash, feeling disgusting phyiscally and mentally. My sink filled with dirty dishes, my fridge filled with left over take out. My work thankfully did not suffer, but at the end I felt myself putting off tasks for later, bc i wanted to smoke. 

Today is my 4th day sober and today I spent the day cleaning my apt, doing laundry, grocery shopping. I am writing this in my clean apt with candles lit, sitting on top of freshly washed sheets. Its just so nice to be sober again.

It’s been a decision I’ve been thinking about for years, in the last week I decided today, Monday January 17, will be my last day ever smoking. 

Here are my reasons: 

“Your end can be your beginning— you just need to know what time you want to start— instead of finishing without ever giving yourself a chance to win.” 

1. Smoking for so long I don’t know what it’s like to NOT feel high. 

2. Pot distracts or masks what I’m feeling underneath the surface, and I don’t even know what that is. Maybe another installation of trauma that doesn’t feel like it’s “safe enough” yet to come out

3. More emotional stability and even further diminish how angry I can feel when I’m triggered.

4. Hoping to lower anxiety/ depression 

5. Feels like it’s what God wants, for me and for my potential and for how I can treat or possibly help others.

6. Expensive

7. Sharper with business 

8. Feeling better in the morning when I wake up; less groggy 

9. Better sleep

10. It’s a crutch that I spent a lot of time attaining, thinking about, and questioning. What will I do with another hour in my day?

These things won’t magically get better just by stopping, I know they will take work. So I’m taking my budgets of what I spent the last 2 months on weed and alcohol (which I gave up about 2 months ago cold turkey), and I’m putting the money instead toward a therapist, a personal trainer, yoga, and some puzzles to tire me out before bed. (For the record, I’ve been working with a therapist since June but quitting hasn’t been a goal of mine til after reading Tara Brach’s Radical Self Change for the third time. 

p.s. Previously, moderation at night use only was my goal, but for some reason I’ve adopted a new goal.

When you quit, life starts getting easier.

I was in my room playing video games while this was happening (I like to distract myself with video games sometimes when they are smoking so that I don’t have an urge to smoke). 

Well, while I was playing video games I started getting real anxious and almost felt high. I open my door to the living room and BAM the entire living room is filled with smoke. I jokingly scolded them for hotboxing our living room and opened a window. I was really proud of myself for quitting and almost hitting one month.

The social anxiety that terminated countless opportunities before they could get off the ground. Literally the money I turned into smoke.

1 day 13 hours clean and no way in hell that it will get resetted. 


Tired of not being mentally “ready” for things, tired of the anxiety, stuttering, overthinking, grogginess, tired of it making me into someone I am not, tired of saying no to social things just to smoke - this will rob you of your life. Tired of it making me LIVE inside my head. 

It is surprisingly easy so far, I used it to escape feelings and boredom, but nah rather go through withdrawals than ruining shit in my life that could make it more fulfilling. 

Smoking again is simply not a posibility for me, the pain and memory of what I just lost will serve as a constant reminder.

I smoked a lot for about 5 months. I got derealization from it and noticed something called visual snow. It was really bad to the point where I couldn’t even focus on anything.

Now it’s been a month since I’ve been clean and it’s almost all but gone except for when I look at the sky or like a white ceiling it’s very faint but it’s there. My eyes also feel weird like there’s film in there, they get blurry and I have to blink and rub my eyes. I also get really bad headaches. I had the headaches before this but never the snow.

I went to an eye doctor and they did a complete scan and my eyes are completely healthy. Aside from a slight astigmatism. 

It didn’t really bother me until I learned that I could have “the trip that never ends”

So is this hppd? I’m worried because I heard it could never go away. I’m 17 years old and I suffer from severe untreated anxiety (my parents don’t believe in treatment) so could this just be from anxiety and stress? 

I think my worst fear is that I’ve ruined my brain forever and that I’ll never be the same and I’ll just learn to live with it and it fades into the background and it’s still there. I don’t want to feel “high” for the rest of my life. I’ve heard horror stories from my family about how “he was never the same again after he took those drugs he’s still high until this day (talking about other drugs) and I don’t want this to be me.

I need something to just fix my mind on. I’ve always had an ‘addictive personality’ which hasn’t really been a problem until weed.

Rehab was a really long and hard process for me, but in the end, it just felt more like a 28 day t-break..I smoked the day after I got out, and I picked up right where I left off. The cravings got substantially worse the last two weeks there, and I felt so much worse without weed the entire time…I genuinely feel as my brain is hard wired to cannabis different than the average person..it’s like full on addiction actions and behaviours that I cannot control. 

So I guess that rehab didn’t quite work out for me, but I’m curious if anyone has any advice on experience with rehab not working for them also and maybe tips for possible next steps that did work for you? Alternatives? Try a different rehab..? Should mention that I’ve already been seeing councillors/psychologists weekly on and off for years.

last time i smoked was on thursday night at home in NY. went to CA with family and the GF and am finding it much easier to quit than when i’ve tried in NY. i think it has to do with environmental triggers, my friends who smoke, etc. . I had some pretty crazy dreams on friday night about being stuck in a mob outside a concert and then running from cops… anyway… woke up a few times that night which is abnormal for me. i felt pretty good on saturday although i definitely had some moments of stronger-than-normal feelings of anger and irritation but also some really good moments in which i felt more clear and light. for context ive been smoking every day for about 3 years and have only really stopped for more than a night once. saturday night however i felt some weird chills and shivering which led into some strong cravings but i managed to stave them off with looking up marijauna withdrawal timelines and assuring myself that the feeling of being clean would outweigh this tough moment 100-fold. i actually slept pretty well saturday night and didnt have any weird dreams. woke up on sunday morning (today) with significantly more energy than i normally have in the morning while not nearly as foggy. i had the same feelings of increased irritability and impatience today but maybe turned up a little bit. around lunch time my appetite was significantly higher than it would normally be which was surprising to me given the last time i tried to quit i experienced an almost complete loss of appetite. about 5 hours later now i’m feeling that same nausea and uncertain appetite and burping/farting which is proving to be uncomfortable. its interesting im already noticing that my stomach has become slightly less distended from whatever gas buildup/GI stress my long term use has caused.  im finding a lot of success in mentally getting past these symptoms with the logic that if weed causes me to feel this way then thats even more reason to quit. in that way the suffering of quitting becomes almost fuel for quitting. im already proud of what ive been able to do so far but i want to continue and see what more changes i notice. if you who is reading this is quitting, stay strong! withdrawals are short lived but clarity and health will last you a lifetime. if you are considering quitting, maybe try to quit for a night first with the plan to smoke again the following night, then two nights, etc. i found this to be a really powerful way to make quitting less intimidating.

It started as occasional (once every couple weeks), but my roommates were stoners so it was always accessible. I started smoking with them more and more and then started buying my own weed. It soon turned into a nightly thing. I have always been strict about only smoking at night because I hate being high during the day, that never really changed. After a couple years of nightly use, I began to hate the fact that I looked forward to it every night, sometimes skipping plans or leaving plans early just to smoke. Although most times I could go without smoking if with friends or family, I would just wit a bowl when I payed down for bed. But I couldn’t sleep without it. 

I quit all together over a month ago because I don’t want to rely on anything to sleep (I stay at my girlfriends a lot who doesn’t smoke. It makes me feel trashy to “smoke to fall asleep” around her). But I also hated that sometimes I tailored my nights to smoking. 

I wasn’t an extremely heavy user. I didn’t depend on it for any sort of emotional or mental support. Mostly just sleep. I don’t really drink, and have never done any other drugs. I moved out, away from my stoner roommates and don’t keep any weed in my apartment anymore. 

The million dollar questions is… can I enjoy it if I’m offered weed at a party or something without feeling the terrible sleep withdrawal again? I don’t think I would fall back into the habit because A. I’m cheap and B. I’m pretty strong willed and also don’t like being viewed as a stoner.

I have been wanting to quit for a while now. After many failed attempts, this one is the most successful. Went the longest till now. Just so you know, i've been at it for 7 years straight now. I was able to stop it for a couple of months around 4 years back and was having a great time with myself, happy and all. But the mistake that i did was thinking that i am in control enough to only smoke occasionly. I was wrong. 1 joint threw me back into the same routine and brought me back to my miserable self.

Now i know. I cannot touch it ever again. I love it too much but its fkg poison. I am so over the moon that even the cravings that i am still getting don't even matter to me. I feel high on happiness and on energy because i am back to my natural healthy self. 

Ik that you might not be able to take a vacation. Or maybe you are not yet ready to break your routine. But the constant thought of me quitting was the thing that helped me out the most. As if i attracted it with time and persistent thought of a healthy me, who is energetic, happy and success oriented. I am a student who works full time. So weed in my life is a no no. Ik that it hasn't been a lomg time since i stopped but I am at the point where i do not have to promise myself to never smoke or consume again. It is deep within me the feelling that Mary is not part of my life anymore and that it is nothing but poison and a bad trip. 

I hope you guys find what i did, pure happiness and healthiness. Ik its not easy and feels like shit sometimes but if you think about quitting hard enough and constintely, then you will be able to do it.

All those cravings and wants were worth it to overcome for this. I can't wait for the future and see how much better my mind and body get as time goes on.

If you're thinking about quiting, do it. Even if just for a little while just to experience how life really is. It's like I'm in a whole new world again and I love it, I love my dreams again, I love enjoying the things I remember enjoying before I smoked.

First, it was great. I had major problems with sleep (from childhood) and nothing helped, except weed. I also suffer highly from depression and anxiety - which at first seemed to help alleviate some symptoms. Of course, what I was really doing was self-medicating. Not just with weed but with other drugs. I've cut out the other drugs (luckily with more ease) but my problem still lied with weed.

At the start of the pandemic, it got completely out of control (as I'm sure it did for many others). Living on my own in a studio flat, being indoors 24/7 with unresolved issues sent my head. I was furloughed from work and spending roughly £300+ a week on weed and other drugs, with most of the money going on weed. I saved absolutely nothing and am left with absolutely nothing. I was then able to go back to work. But by that time, my head was too far gone.

Up until the end of December last year, I could only focus on getting absolutely fucked every single night after work, getting home and finishing the night off with spliffs upon spliffs. I could really, really, really feel my head going, and not the same way as I've felt before. Come New Years, I realised I had to do something different before it was too late.

I'm now 2 weeks sober from other drugs and now hitting my 5th night from weed. Already my mind feels clearer and I can see what next steps to take for recovery. However it's not easy-going (which I fully expected). I wake up and I feel sick; my head is pounding and feels stuffy, and I'm just a shell. I've now lost my job and struggle to get out of bed/leave the flat most days. My anxiety is absolutely through the roof and at random moments, I'm hit with nothing but a pitch black void and despair.

I'm determined to do things differently. I've lost so many people and completely lost myself and I don't want to give up any more. I'm absolutely terrified beyond belief but I hope with the right support and headspace, I'll get there.",37,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7524451}"

The first few days were very physical, but I could honestly handle that. It was annoying, sure, but my resolve wasn't really phased yet.  


Now though, I feel like I should never have stopped:  
\-I have pretty much literally lost all joy in my life. I expected this as well, but not to the degree it's going now. Absolutely nothing brings me even a semblence of enjoyment anymore. Not gaming, not reading, not watching series or movies, not hiking, nothing at all. Everything feels 100% pointless and the only emotion I feel pretty much 24/7 is utter frustration.  


\-I've always loved to dream. I had no problem dreaming while smoking, as opposed to many other users apparently, but my dreams after maybe a week of quitting are terrible. They're not nightmares. I could deal with being chased by monsters or finding my family chopped up in a dream. ALL my dreams are about rejection. Being turned away from real-life events (things that really happened, I've always been a social outcast). Being turned away from purely fantasy events. Being scorned by society or smaller groups. Every single possible iteration of rejection is somehow turned into a dream scenario. I also only manage to sleep in increments of 3 hours tops. The first two weeks or so I could still sleep somewhat normally.  


\-I've come the conclusion that I loathe my job. Not just my job, but my entire ""career"" (lol), the only things I have experience in and can feasibly find another job in. I don't want to anymore. I'm currently on medical leave, officially due to burnout, but the burnout isn't caused by my job sucking (although it certainly does). I've just given up the only thing that made it bearable for 6+ years. The jobs I had before this one were way worse still. I'm almost 40 and I've already been back to school to get a second degree long after graduating. I really really can't see myself do that again, not to mention I don't have the financial reserves for it.  


\-My relationship with my SO and child, which was always pretty great, has deteriorated markedly. They are both aware of my condition and struggle and do everthing they can do support and accommodate me, and that just makes me feel even worse and more guilty about everything. They don't deserve to bear any of the weight I managed to place on myself.  


\-My physical health has also gone way down instead of up. I've always had low blood pressure which never bothered me. Nowadays I'm like 150/95 and my heartreate doesn't go below 95 anymore even while lying down and resting. I've lost about 20 pounds since quitting and I was already on the skinny side. I think my BMI dropped below 20 by now.  


\-My finances are in no better shape than before I quit, even though I spent 300/week on it. It's just one bill after the other, mostly medical right now, and I'm pretty sure if I'd kept smoking I wouldn't be dealing with this at all.  


\-I've always had a huge problem with worrying about the general state of the world (climate change, ...) and since I've quit, I can't stop thinking about how useless everthing is and what the point of everything is since we're all stuck on this godforsaken ball of mud about to be cooked like a pot in a clay oven while slaving away for a select few overlords who get to reap all the benefits while piling all the shit on us. I fully realize that smoking up won't change any of that at all, but at least it allowed me to put it out of my mind for the time being. I've searched and searched for something wholesome to replace it with but I cannot. Also, what's the point in getting healthy to live long when all that means is you'll be subject to much more suffering in the long run? Previously I was fine with dropping dead between 40-60 from a heart attack or pulmonary embolism. Now, the prospect scares me but only because of the consequences for my family and finances, not my own wellbeing.  


Despite this, I haven't relapsed yet, though not for a lack of want. I'd disappoint the few people on this earth who can still stand me so much if I relapsed that I fear that would be the final nail in the coffin, so I can't risk it.   


I did try to take up some philosophy and such, almost through Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. Great advice, and I have mad respect for the man and his writings, but reading it and living it are wholly different things. I can absorb it, mull it in my head, come to conclusions, but I have no idea how to put any of it in practice in a way that works.

I don't even feel any cravings for getting high or off my rocker in any way. I just want to be able to feel any sort of enjoyment, any sort of contentment and acceptance AT ALL.  


I have an appointment with a psych in a few weeks (made weeks ago, but 1-2 month waitlists are normal here and actually on the short side, especially since the pandemic).  


At this point my list of cons is a lot bigger than my list of pros concerning quitting. And I know a month isn't that long in the grand scheme of things, but it's getting worse every day, not better. What did I get myself into...",10,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9013872}"

I did take around 5 breaks, ranging from 1 month to 1 year. 109 days ago I decided to stop masturbating. After a month of abstinence from masturbating, weed started to give me anxiety and it was clear that my relationship with MJ had ran it's course. 73 days ago I decided weed has no place in my life anymore.

The first few weeks were great, I didn't have too many physical withdrawal symptoms. After a month, PAWS started to hit me. I started having mild waves of anhedonia and anxiety, I am still experiencing the waves. However, the waves seem to be losing their strength. I am currently in one of those waves, but there isn't much anxiety - just the anhedonia. I know that if I keep active, be positive / social, and live a healthy lifestyle, the wave will pass.

I believe lifting, cold showers, cleaning up my diet, staying busy and working towards my goals, hitting the sauna, Wim Hoff breathing, limiting my phone usage, and meditating have helped speed up my recovery. I still don't feel like ""my old self"", but at least the waves are manageable and the anxiety is gone. I am also catching myself genuinely laughing, which is a good sign.

This year will be a year I spend in the trenches, paying back the universe for my bad habits and self indulgence. I have accepted that, and I am going to make the best of it :) - by next year, I am going to be very close to the person I want to be. I will continue to make PAWS my bitch, by living healthy and trucking through the bad feelings. Best of luck everyone!",9,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7291644}"

I was addicted for many years and now I am at a point where I do not feel like I need marijuana anymore.  This community is an amazing thing and I appreciate all the incredible advice I've seen here before.

Now, there is some wonderful advice on here that helped me, however I don't just want to regurgitate things that people have already said.  My one piece of advice is seemingly counter-intuitive at first, and likely won't work for everyone, but worked wonders for me after many attempts at quitting, so hear me out.

If you're like me, every time you quit you either finished your weed, or got rid of it all completely.  This is a good method for some, but it never stuck for me, and I always ended up buying more and relapsing.  So, instead of keeping marijuana out of my house while quitting, I quit mid way through an Oz I was working my way through.  And instead of throwing everything away, I packed all my weed and paraphernalia into a drawer.  Not as a ""I'll use again one day"" but more as an exercise to help myself develop self control.  This method is absolutely more difficult in the beginning as your stash is right there, waiting for you to relapse.  However, it has saved me in the long run as making the conscious decision not to smoke (while being able to) is much easier after time has passed.  In addition, all of my friends still smoke weed, and I didn't want to lose them.  So, this method allowed me to develop self control while still being around the plant.

In order to help yourself get through the very difficult beginning, I recommend you write yourself a note and put it on top of your weed stash.  Whatever your reason is for quitting, and a reminder of how you feel when you smoke.  Or, you can do what I did, and keep it very simple.  I wrote a note,""Are you sure? -A very unhappy you"" and put it on top of my weed stash.  I almost relapsed twice, convinced myself to break into my stash, and then I saw my note.  The note reminded me why I am suffering through this.

There is also something metaphorical about putting it all into a drawer.  It is sort of the dragon or monster that is always chasing you in life.  Except, it is all in a drawer, and if it stays in that drawer, it cannot hurt you.  Don't let the dragon out.

I'd like to end this by saying self-control is hard.  You're not bad at self-control, you're just a human being.  Don't kill yourself over this simple fact.  However, you are responsible for helping yourself, and you should treat yourself like someone who deserves to be helped.  Be kind to yourself, and recognize it is not easy.  Having the maturity to know when you have a problem is something everyone here should be commended for.  Don't give up, don't give in, and if you fall off the horse, get back on and keep going.  I love you all.",47,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6185796}"

i was taking huge steps towards my dream career starting at age 14 and working hard every single day for years, and everything started going downhill when i turned 18 and started smoking pot. now i’m about to graduate college and i feel like i missed out on so much because of it, when i was acting like it was the only thing that could help me get through my mental illnesses and trauma. taking bong rips and stashing edibles just to get through a simple 8am class started to feel so normal to me because it was the only thing that kept me from thinking about how badly i wanted to die 24/7. eventually i just resigned that the damage i had done was irreversible and that i would be useless regardless of quitting because of my ADD. the guilt and shame of being so low compared to where i was before made me isolate myself from everyone and everything i love for years. but i know now that i’m stronger than all of that. 

next month will mark 8 years since cancer took my mom away from me, and i’d like to still be clean on the anniversary of that day and hopefully feel like i’m doing things that would have made her proud, even if it took me a while to get here. 

thanks for listening (and wish me luck, lol) 💖",19,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4185929}"

I would vape 2/3 days a week, always when I'm around friends or when I'm just in a bad mood or feel depressed. I stopped smoking because my memory and speechmaking was getting wrecked, I could hardly find the words I'm looking for and my concentration was gone. 

So last week I threw away my entire stash, 11grams, and there is no going back for me. Mostly when something occured at work or I had a dispute with a colleague I just would smoke when getting home to ease my mind and mostly it was solved. Now I had a heavy dispute the day after I stopped weed and my mind has been nagging on it for 7 days straight. Even when I'm tired and I go to bed, my brain is keeping me awake for another hour or 2 to remind me of the situation and not granting me any closure. 

Can anyone relate with these ""redrawal?"" effects when he/she stopped smoking weed? To be completely open, being in this situation is not making me want to smoke pot again, I sometimes just think about how I would normally just smoke and the thoughts would fade eventualy but I'm at a stage that I know that I have to deal with it myself and not be dependent on pot.

When I’m sober, my mindset is always so worried, I worry too much about everything, past, 
present, future, even high too sometimes. 

But I was playing NBA 2k22 with my brother, and almost had an epiphany when the game was about to start and I realized that I don’t care if this is a game or not, if I’m choosing to make this decision, then I’m going to go at it 100% until I choose to do another thing, and I actually played almost exactly how I play in real life, even before the game started I was taking deep breaths in and slowly out, as I sometimes do when I play real basketball. 

It honestly felt good to smoke, but I think the real reason why I did it was because I accepted the manager position at my pizza place, and really feel overwhelmed and like I won’t apply myself to do what I say I’m going to do. I will be working part time, 14 hours at a different job, then probably full time at the pizza place, luckily my boss is really understanding and really made me feel great about myself, but when I took my break at 3:30, I didn’t come back and ended up playing basketball for 4 hours, I made up an excuse, then today I said I needed an off day because I’ve been dealing with some stuff and I gave him about a 4-5 hour notice, he wasn’t able to let me do that because we really are short staffed, and I ended up responding an hour later saying that I got food poisoning, and have been throwing up. 

I really need to do this for myself, I would love to do this for myself, but Its like I have two different mindsets that switch back and forth, one is me being efficient and loving what I do and the progress I’m making, the other is me worried and really overthinking about things that if I were doing I’d probably be enjoying it. it’s just me getting up and trying to get through the temptations I guess.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.53504235}"

It’s also turning into a 50-60$ a day habit which is not ok. 

Old hobbies and interests that spark that old natural feeling of joy and happiness seem dull and boring even tho I still know I am into them.

It’s at that point where when I smoke I know I don’t want to, but I do it anyways, then regret what I just did. I have even gone as far as writing down things such as “you felt better before you smoked, don’t smoke.” To try and remind me of how I felt when I woke up in the morning.

Yesterday, I met up with that one friend who always gets high and has those stupid pens. “Hey man glad you to see you, this place is chill, I have my pen so we can hit that.” And a wave of emotions came over me in one second that felt like a lifetime. ‘He just offered to get me high. I’m off work just chilling here, I could get high right now.’ 

And almost like an automated answering machine I explained to him, “Ah, no thanks man I’m off the stuff for 2 months now.” And that was it. We started hanging out like we normally did where I was just drinking my lite beer and he was too but he was also toking. 

I was scared, honestly. I could have said yes and “ruined” all of my progress. My life the past two months flashed before my eyes. All of my accomplishments and all of my struggles. It all could have come crashing down because my friend just wanted to be nice in his own, stoner way. 

All I can take away from this is that this was huge and small at the same time. I didn’t want to hit the pen and get high and get paranoid and tired and everything else awful and nice about getting stoned.

So here’s the story: I’ve been smoking weed since 2015. In Canada over here, there are these bowls with nicotine in them called poppers. I was smoking poppers for years! Until recently I decided to take away the cigarette batch from my weed toke. I’ve been cigarettes free for only a week. But I want to quit smoking weed as well. 

I chose to smoke weed irresponsibly and now I believe I have a cannabis use disorder. It honestly feels like an addiction. I can get by quitting cigarettes, if I’m smoking weed still.. 
I want this craving to go away. It affects my daily living, I can’t be outside of the house for too long with out my bong, or some form of thc. I smoke in between breaks at my job. 

I know obviously in Canada weed is legal to smoke which makes it seem more okay. But I’m unable to smoke Responsibily. Where do I go from here? I don’t have any parents living with me. I’m not good with self control and the cravings drive me almost insane .

I realize I’ve been smoking weed daily all day because I’m bored?

What can I expect from quitting?

Then my birthday rolled around on the 13th and I convinced myself it would be okay to smoke a blunt. That first night I smoked again I was so unbelievably high and paranoid. I decided that it was the drug telling me it was time to let it go. Despite that, I still found myself smoking every night afterwards, because hey I still have half a blunt & then eventually a roach left, gotta smoke it all right? My tolerance quickly shot back up and I didn't even get that same high I did on my birthday. 

I'm tired of the chokehold this silly little plant has over me. I don't even really enjoy being high, I just do to to stave off boredom. Is being a little less bored for 30 minutes worth being tired all day The next day? No. It's not. I'M READY TO GIVE IT UP FOR GOOD.

We smoked a few joints, we played a few games and I went to bed stoned and tipsy. I woke up this morning fully expecting to be craving, but no! No cravings! 

I was always scared to quit because I didn’t know how it would effect me, how my mental state would be or how I would be. But now, I know. Last night was still a slip up but I know I can do this and all it showed me was that I don’t need this herb in my life anymore. It reminded me about how I would feel and act stone vs sober and I pick sober. I have no question marks over my head now and I also know that should I want to smoke sometimes, I can without it becoming a 24/7 habit again. 10 days was all it took for me to see clearly I know where I really stand on quitting.

I don't have any great advice for anyone except to say that you have to choose again each day to stay clean. Many days I thought about relapsing and decided yet again that it was a bad idea. I just want to add that it I did it with a smoker in the house. My sisters boyfriend carried on smoking and there is weed, a grinder and a bong down stairs next to his bed. I walk past it every day when I go to the kitchen. He also smokes when he gets home and when I go down for dinner, the whole place stinks of weed. I even gave him money for weed a few times when he was desperate. He did offer me some a few times and I said no thanks. Point is I made up my mind.

So, last year was a nightmare and I went through hell. Getting hooked again scares the shit out of me because I can't go through that again. The main reason that I quit was because I was always in a bad mood and treating people like garbage especially my mom. She is in her late 70's and her health is poor. I hated who I had become, how I was treating her and I was terrified of having to face her death being in such a fragile and messed up state of mind. There were many times that I thought, maybe one day I will smoke again, maybe when I'm on my death bed and the end is near etc BUT now it's much easier to imagine a future without it. I had my time with weed but now its time for a new chapter.

https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/piastb/1_week_without_weed_after_10_years_of_smoking/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

As you might imagine I relapsed after about 1 month and went just straight back to to my old habit (~20g/week)

The problem was that I couldn't accept the fact that I will never smoke weed again in my life. I always wanted to be able to moderate my weed consumption. 

I don't know how this happened but I finally realized it's impossible for me to just smoke once in a week or month. 

So I had the choice: 

Do I want to be dependent on a goddamn plant and chainsmoke all day, doing nothing spectacular and fucking up my brain more and more while getting depressed because of that lifestyle?

Or do I want to develop myself by going out of my comfort zone, working on my physical&mental health and just feel pleasure by doing ""normal"" things, which are not weed related?

I picked the second Option, I'm totally fine with never smoking weed again.

I threw all my weed stuff away and I'm Sober since 4. January 2022.

A few days ago a friend visited me and he wanted to give me 2-3g of reeaaally delicious weed as a present. I didn't take it and it felt sooo good! Never thought I could decline free weed. Yes guys, I'm really proud of myself and that boosted my motivation to the roof. Can't wait to hit 1 month, 1 year, 10 years...!

I am trying to find out answers on my questions by questioning myself on the daily and to experience life, instead of having fear for not recovering from my addiction.

* Write down 3 things I do better than most people.

1. I meditate very regularly, almost daily. I also take cold showers. These two habits together make me feel alive and ready to tackle a day.
2. I am starting to read more every day. I found out I love learning and reading new interesting topics, and I want to make it a top priority to keep learning every day.
3. I actually try to challenge myself to learn by asking myself questions on the daily. To understand myself better and to perceive my thoughts on paper instead of keeping them all in my head.

* After recovery, what’s one skill I’d love to learn?

I want to focus on having meaningful relationships with other people and I want to get good at defending my own borders. For a really long time, I couldn't strive for my own personal goals because I was getting incredibly influenced by my friends. I had no way to say no to other people. I would love to learn to love myself more. By loving myself more I feel I can love others more as well. 

* Write down 4 questions I want answers to. I hope I can get some answers from the community of /r/leaves

1. I want to know what people do when they spend time alone and are experiencing urges to go to the coffeeshop or roll a jay. How can I tackle my urges and start enjoying the things I used to love before my addiction started 4 years ago.
2. What is the best health advice you can give someone who is trying to be more physically fit?
3. What things can I start to experience once I get to 2 weeks of not using any marijuana?
4. What is the one key concept you try to remember yourself to when it comes to not smoking marijuana? How do you stay motivated and stay clean from it?

* When I meet new people, what I you want them to know about me?

I want to meet new people that share the same core values as I do. I want to find people who enjoy walking, being in nature, creating music and who love tea and coffee! I would like it if people knew me as a person who likes to live mindfully and who is up for an adventure.

* What do I want to accomplish tomorrow?

I want to continue to improve daily and to try to fight the urge to use cannabis. I know it's hard but I feel something in my body telling me this is the most important step I am taking, because right now writing this I feel no anxiety whatsoever.

* Do I like who I am when no one is watching? How can I change that?

I like myself when no one is watching more and more. I try to experience the present moment when I am alone. I realise that everyone in the world can experience isolation when they perceive themselves as isolated from other people. It's normal to feel this loneliness and the more I try to realise this I experience not feeling lonely.",1,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7374586}"

I'm going out one more time before the snowstorm hits, and lucky for me I have no cash and no way to buy any cannabis products before it hits, and my bf is at work and won't buy anything. I'm really excited for this snow storm to hit, it looks like we will be snowed in for a while and that means I'll get through the hardest day of fighting addiction with literally no way to get weed. That's day 3, not because of symptoms, but because I just have a weird thing with numbers. 

It was really nice waking up this morning not feeling like I had the dreaded ""weed hangover"", and not immediately shitting my guts out after I woke up. Also, no morning anxiety, which I thought I developed because I'm now a young professional, but I think it was the lingering high or something. I was able to eat a good meal for the first time without smoking OR feeling like I was going to throw up for the first time in probably 6 months. And damn, it was a great sandwich. Id go through a cycle where i smoked, cooked, smoked, ate. If I did it in the morning let's say, I couldn't go out for lunch without smoking. I struggle with OCD and started having obsessive thoughts about what will happen to me if I don't smoke before eating if I've already smoked that day. 

I didn't smoke for THAT long, I started dabbling in 2020 and was a very regular user in 2021, so hopefully withdrawal symptoms will be easy on me. The only issue I had was trying to sleep, and even then I was out cold by 2. Goodluck and godspeed to everyone that's about to get snowed in too.

After 20 years on and off I did managed to stop smoking 2 long periods, first 3 years and second 1 yearish and I am here to say there's hope and it will get better!

First time it wasn't so bad, I had to stop due to work and I was only smoking for 5 years or so. Second time was hell, but I was on prescription medication for anxiety and depression which helped a bit on anxiety and paranoia (the withdrawal of both these wasn't fun tho). Now, this 3rd time, it's being horrible as it is truly cold turkey as I can't take any kind of medication to help and I don't drink alcohol as well. I'm on my 7th day and now it's for good. Still smoking cigs as I think it would overdo my plan, it's all about planing and steps. March I'll tackle the cigs situation :)

I'll tell you more or less my withdrawal symptoms and how I am managing it, be advised it's still bad:

- Paranoia & anxiety. Well if you are an overthinker and neurotic like me, be ready for a ride. What I do: try to have a friend/wife/husband you can talk to. My wife is a gem, she's helping me a lot with this. Secret here is to try to be distracted from yourself, at list for the first days. See, every stoner is ""bipolar"" in the sense that you'll always a voice telling that you can just have a toke, you're strong enough blah blah. I accepted what I am, an addict, so I must treat myself as one. Not saying that you should do it as well.

- Panic attacks: well this sucks a lot because you literally feel that you're having a heart attack. Try to breath slowly and deep. Don't inhale too much oxygen as it will trigger more and more. Having a covid mask can help this, or even your hands to balance oxygen/dioxide carbon intake.

- Night sweats/nightmares/vivid dreams: make sure you are at peace that this might happen. Afterwards, take a hot shower and get back to bed. I'm a believer, so before bed me and my wife pray together and ask God to protect our sleep and dreams, this helps me a lot.

- Belching/throw up: anxiety makes me belch a lot and sometimes I do throw up, mostly saliva tho. If you have this, have a bucket ready and try to not eat much in one take. I was taking 2 hours to eat a sandwich.

- Rollercoaster of emotions: if you feel like crying, don't try to stop, just cry yourself out. You'll feel much better afterwards. There were times I've cried like a baby and laughed like a mad man.

- insomnia: well in my case I can't fall asleep without some music or the TV on, need some noise. Experts say that you should avoid mobile/TV screens 30m before bed. So it depends. I would avoid taking medication to sleep as they are addictive as well. Try herbal tea and meditation (I hate it tho).



After the withdrawal symptoms why did I stop smoking:

Not going to lie, I really really like weed, I like how it made me feel and 'helped' to cope with depression, paranoia and anxiety (it really only masked tbh). Had a lot of fun, I was always smoking, to a point I always passed on my couch with a joint in my hand, wake and bake next day. It got to a point i built so much resistance to it that after smoking the only thing I felt was numbness and emptiness. That's no way to live and enjoy your life. So I stopped to romanticising weed and accepted that weed is a drug, it doesn't really matter how hard its considered, medicinal or not, it's still a drug. If I depend on it I'm an addict. It's really hard looking in the mirror and accept that I am an addicted, but it is what it is. After considering this, would I want to keep living as an addict: can't sleep, eat, watch a movie, music etc without it, or sometimes had to look for sketchy dealers to get it, keep straining my marriage because of it? Every other attempt It was either work related or I was tryingThis mindset helped me make my decision to stop. It's all about stop trying and doing it. No more excuses, no more secret stashes just in case (flushed everything I had 50g or so), no more it's just today I deserve it. Now I'm not trying to quit I'm quitting for good! 


I know I only have one week in, but I was clean for 3y and I know what to expect I know it's possible. If it's possible for me it's possible for you, I now must pay the price of running from myself for so so many years. My inner voice still tries to justify the use of weed, I know if I could smoke now every crap withdrawal symptom would go away and I could try to moderate the usage, which we all know what would happen if I went down that road but at the same time the fog in my brain is clearing and my mind is getting sharper each day, so it's getting easier to resist.

Other difference from last attempts is I try not to dwell on the past, what's done is done, can't change it. I know it's easy to say, but I'm trying to look back and learn from it and try to enjoy the years I have left in my life. I'm still young and there's plenty of things I want to do.

Sorry about the long post, this is my story. Even if it helps only 1 person I'd be happy.

About to hit 4 months in 2 days after stopping 17th September 2021. 4 months ago, a single month seemed like too hard of a task. But here we are. 

Here's the biggest thing I've learnt since stopping. 

**Quitting weed and getting over the cravings and symptoms doesn't immediately make your life feel good again**. This was undoubtedly one of the hardest challenges to face. I thought that stopping weed would instantly make the trees brighter again, but that was not the case.

See, my mental health was on a decline with or without weed. Weed, without a doubt, made that decline worse. But with weed in my life, it made the improvement impossible. 

**Quitting weed has now made the possibility of self-improvement possible again.**

I job hopped. Became even broker than when I was a stoner. I became s\*\*\*\*\*al. I was lost, depressed, helpless, and felt even worse since being an actual stoner.

But at almost 4 months, the trees are becoming brighter again. (Actual trees, not weed trees).

I have learnt more about myself the past 4 months then I have the past 14 years. I've learnt to be kind to myself, and to give myself a break. Once I forgave myself for even stooping to that level, that's when I was able to move on. 

**Quitting weed may not be that light at the end of the tunnel most hope for, but it does let enough light in to guide you through it.**

The road might be a long and arduous one but I promise you that if you actually put in the effort to better yourself and fight though the anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, and general malaise, you'll absolutely make progress.

Currently, I'm travelling through asia and my latest relapse is now around 12 days old. Since then, I kept smoking everyday from morning until I go to bed. Mental health logically gets worse.

When I compare these 12 days to the 12 days I had in my last period of 1 month sobriety, I get confused. I know, that I was so much more able to enjoy life, to feel my feelings, to handle my moodswings and dark thoughts. I enjoyed life, in a way I never did before.
With smoking weed, all of the above is way harder to accomplish. Tbh, it's impossible to accomplish.

And that's the point where I get angry. Why do I prefer stoning, with knowing my life will get worse, to a clear minded and way more fulfilled life?

Is it trauma-induced and I still got to dig deeper in my past with therapy? Is it the addiction? Is it me?
I'm really out of answers.....

Would appreciate your opinions about this a lot.

For a few hours I feel great knowing that I'm letting go of something that I have held onto for 17 years (I'm 34). However randomly I'll have super negative thoughts and I mean NEGATIVE like ""fuck my job fuck my life what's the point of living?"" type. For those of you who go through similar mood swings try practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness has really helped me because when I have those negative thoughts I don't accept them as my own but rather as a product of my addiction. I observe them and allow them to pass. I've noticed that I do this more and more when the negative thoughts emerge that I'm pretty much getting in ""reps"" to strength my positive ""muscles"". 

The next time a negative thought happens during a mood swing just take a deep breathe, observe the thought then let the thought pass. The frequency will decrease and you'll be teaching the addict side of you that it can try as much as it wants to ""trick"" you into relapse but it ain't gonna happen.

After countless attempts to moderate or completely quit my weed usage, I wholeheartedly believe that I have finally left the plant behind for good. The reason I am writing this post is not for accountability, but to share with the community what has finally worked for me. 

To start, I just want to say that if you’re reading this, you without a doubt have the capability to stop your usage forever. The power to do it is in us all. If you are on this sub, it means there’s a part of you that wants to stop. Being aware of the side of you that wants to quit is already a gigantic step towards actually doing it.

In all my previous attempts, I definitely struggled a lot. I truly know how hard it can be. Now since I don’t know you personally, I don’t know the things you’ve tried and can only share what has worked in my personal experience.

The one thing that changed my life and finally allowed me to quit was having a shift in my mindset. I was able to change it by reading a lot of different self-help books. As a college student, I was smoking everyday with my roommate. I didn’t even plan on quitting once I had started up again. But as I started to read many different books, I finally actually desired to kick the habit. That was the key difference between quitting now and “trying” to quit before. I “tried” quitting in the past for many different reasons, but never because I wanted to. Because I never truly wanted to quit, I really struggled against the cravings and always slowly justified using again. But now that will actually never happen again. I used to use weed as an escape from my past, which I have finally learned to accept. 

There was one notable book that helped me completely overcome my cravings, but I’m not sure I’m allowed to share the title and don’t want this post to sound like a sales pitch. This book was really powerful and taught me the significance of the present moment. I applied what I learned from the book to quitting, and it has helped me tremendously. I used to struggle so much and dread being sober, but now it’s the opposite. A key thing that it taught me was the present moment is all we ever have. If I ever have a craving, all I have to do is remind myself that if I don’t smoke at this current moment, then I will never smoke again. But I no longer even need to do that because I have completely left the plant in the past. Cravings no longer come or phase me. Quitting is all a mindset. You either smoke or you don’t, and you have the ability to choose whether you do or not. You have the willpower to move your muscles, and you also have the willpower to not move them. The choice is yours.",25,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5052818}"

It may take a month for you, it may take much longer but sooner or later, you will feel the natural high of being sober. Exercise is an important step though. That or any other activity or hobby that best suits you is highly recommended. Just sitting still not smoking might not give you the happiness you seek and could likely lead you back to the habit.

2022-01-14 20:46:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/s48nmy/weighing_out_the_pros_and_cons/,Weighing out the Pros and Cons,"Hi Everyone,

First off, I want to thank everyone in this community and especially everyone that I've interacted with over the last year and a half. I've joined the discord server a few times last year and definitely appreciated all the supportive interactions I've had on the discord server.

Like most of you guys, I've had my share of several Day 1s. I had a situation happen that I documented here back in April 2021. I was able to go 3 months before diving back into old habits. What was originally suppose to be one 3-day weekend ended up becoming every weekend and then eventually almost every other day. While I was still comparatively moderate this time when compared to a few years back, I was very mindful that I need to go back to sobriety eventually and never lost sight of that.

Fast forward to December 2021. I'm doing the chicken dance every other day.

I'm enjoying the highs but the highs but I'm still bored out my mind. I've had nights where I've binge-watched countless YouTube videos (and not remembering anything about them after watching them or be able to articulate a summary of what I just watched). Nothing on Netflix sounded interesting so I started re-watching stuff I've already seen.... episodes of Rick and Morty, episodes of The Boys, etc etc.

What the heck am I doing with my life?

Shortly before Christmas with 2022 around the corner, I make the intention that I want to stop smoking again. I did want to have one more last ""ceremonial session"" before I stop completely all together. It ended up being multiple last sessions finally culminating in the last 3 days of the year where I was extremely stoned to the point where I was like ""damn, I don't think I've ever been this high!"".

It was fun while it lasted. I was happy with where I was with this ceremonial session. As soon as it hit midnight, I packed up all my shit and accessories in layers of old clothes and plastic bags as a goodbye ritual. Tied up several knots in each layer enclosing all the shit and buried it deep in my closet. I know most folks would say I should throw this all out but it hasn't worked for me in the past. I think I might be dealing with some past unresolved trauma here and the symbolic act of ""burying"" it in my closet seemed like a reasonable idea.

Looking back at the last 14 days, things have been pretty smooth. I'm grateful that I haven't had any extreme symptoms. Slight pockets of insomnia first few days...followed by the need to get more sleep over the next few days. I feel like I'm in a good place now.

Well... now is Friday night. This weekend happens to be a 3-day weekend and I have the crib all to myself this weekend. I guess I can classify this as a possible trigger for me - I wanted to swing by here to get away from going back to old habits. By no means do I want to smoke right now because I don't want to undo my progress and restart at Day 0.

If you've came this far in my post, I want to thank you for taking the time to read this.

I also want to share some pros and cons that helped me in my decision to quit consuming cannabis.

Pros for Quitting Cannabis (in no particular order)

1. No late night munchies
2. Restful sleep cycle. Sleep is vital for overall health and function
3. No more short term memory issues
4. Gain an average of 3 extra hours per day to do/pursue other stuff
5. Spend quality time with my SO, family members, and friends that don't consume
6. More time to upgrade my skills in other areas after work
7. Time to read all the fascinating books I've collected over the years.
8. Track my progress by maintaining a journal regularly
9. Actively track/control my finances instead of just making sure I had money to squander
10. Save an average of $250/per month by eliminating THC consumption
11. Healthier eating. Redirect THC-money for higher quality groceries and actually cooking.
12. Focus on physical and mental fitness. Reclaim sovereignty over my mind and body.
13. Clean up my mind and body for Ramadan (might sound silly but I haven't had a proper Ramadan in almost two decades)
14. Take steps to improve my career and accomplish better things at work
15. I'll have 3 extra hours a day. 15 hours a week to focus on a combination of the above.

Cons for Quitting Cannabis

1. First couple weeks will be touch. Roller coaster of emotions, possible nightmares
2. Won't be able to ""recharge myself w/ a small weed break"" to break up the monotony of daily life.

Honestly speaking, with reviewing the above... clearly a no-brainer on what's the better option.

I thought to myself why am I even debating with myself about quitting?

Thanks again for reading my post. Just wanted to share this to keep myself motivated tonight and not smoke out of boredom. I also wanted to share this with anyone that's on the fence about stopping.

I have $20 cash in my wallet, it’s overcast and snowing, this is my last day of work before a 3 day weekend, I have *serious* family drama happening right now (primarily regarding another family member), weed would numb the pain from so many people have nice cars while mine is a beat up car with issues and I wish I were making more money and not living paycheck to paycheck, the drive home from the dispensary would feel so great with a joint on my lips and a Mtn Dew in my hand and my favorite smoking music playing, I’ve been sober for around 1.5mo so a couple J’s won’t hurt, I had to go out and run an important errand anyway so I could easily swing by a dispensary, someone I like is a functioning toker so I could be too, I feel shitty today (ate something I’m intolerant to by accident) and weed would help sooth that, the list goes on and on.


I’m sitting in my car right now. I managed to drive home without going by a dispensary, despite every sinew in my body telling me how good it would feel to smoke.


Reasons I chose not to buy any J’s: when I’m high I can’t follow details in movies or tv shows, and I suck at video games for the same reason. Weed helps me fall asleep easier but I sleep worse and my nose is super stuffy going to sleep. I told myself I wanted to go all of 2022 without smoking if I can make it. I don’t study or do much productive stuff while high, although I’m not particularly productive in general right now. Even though it would only be 1-2 days of smoking, it would probably be enough for me to have a day or three of low key depression withdrawals.

I said yes and it was the most life changing experience I've ever experienced. I was singing F U to my ex from the top of the rooftop. It was a wild night and my good friend kept me some good company. Simply life changing experience and idk where I would have been if i had never met the people I did to introduce me to weed. 

I'm 29 now and I've been a daily smoker pretty much for 5 years, only to have ""quit"" once at 27 for 2 months for a job. Covid happened and I started smoking daily again, doing delivery apps while staying stoned to make ends meet. 

I've been sober off weed for about a week and a half now, trying to figure out the next steps in my life. Currently too broke to even afford weed so I'm just using that as a segue into a reason to quit, and it just makes sense. I can't buy weed at least til i'm at least financially stable. Literally. Then we can go from there.

It's been going pretty smoothly. Eating a lot better. Possibly sleeping a lot better? I can't really tell. My brain feels like its starting to get healthier, since I've been doing a lot of research on healthier options for foods. Burgers and pizzas all freaking day just dont work for me. Maybe once in a while, but i mean i related all that food with weed anyways, so I've been fiending for better options to addict myself to. actually I can tell the past 5 years of my life, kind of have been a big waste, but a necessary one in order to I feel reach my best potential. I can't waste time lamenting on the past really. It makes no sense to, so I just don't. Maybe when I can afford weed again I can think about my life and the past but right now is just simply not the time to.

One thing I can take away from all this.. if you're feeling down, feeling sad about something, and you're just stuck in a loop, weed can definitely help change your views. I really feel like since my Ex meant pretty much everything to me, ANDREA, and I still do care, I was just so hurt by the breakup that I legit couldn't function. I was dead inside, and my only thought was what i could do to get her back.. but that's not usually the answer when it comes to those kinds of situations. Was weed a better solution? idk, nor will i ever know, but it's the solution I took, and because of that solution, because I said yes to smoking that one night my brain simply just fell in love with weed, full stack. Almost like it was looking for something to fall in love with. after that amazing experience on the roof, just randomly singing as best as i could, just enjoying, feeling a kind of love i never experienced before, a love dedicated towards myself.. thats something weed did for me and I really dont think I could have gotten that kind of introspection if i never was introduced to weed. But now I must say it is definitely time to leave weed. It's been fun, super real, but like, rn i'm broke and almost homeless. I make no freakin money and I potentially have to change that. at least so I can get some more weed. Or a new car since the one i was using before is kinda fucked. Yeah.... a car is probably better than buying more weed, so i think I'll work on doing just that. Thats better than using money to buy weed, haha.

Quit for 2008, relapsed hard. Quit again May 2021. My observations is that there truly \*is\*, a Law of Universal Attraction. i.e. the kind of energy I give out, equals the kind of energy I attract.

When I smoke 24/7, my energy & attitude is:  
\-why bother ? (Nihilism For the Lose, so to speak)  
\- unless of course, it's a short term, hedonistic activity (mindless eating, mindless sex, mindless TV, mindless internet)  
\- half-tanking through life is perfectly acceptable  
\- wasting my potential doesn't even register, and if / when it does, it gets tamped down by weed  
\- The 4 D's Rule My Life -- any feedback is met with Deny, Deflect, Defend, Downplay

Guess who I attract in my life when I'm like this ? Yup ! People who:  
\- are nihilistic  
\-mind numbingly interested \*only\* in immediate gratification / hedonim

\- half tanking through life  
\- and habitually respond to any feedback that might be an opportunity for growth, with ""The 4 D's"" -  Denial, Deflection, Defensiveness, and Downplaying issues

I made a list of people who I admire, respect and want to emulate. None of them give out  negative energy on a consistent basis. I want to attract people like this. Despite being 65, I just keep thinking ""Omg, I want to be like you when I grow up !"" I am 100% convinced I will find these types of admirable people being more 'attracted' to my energy as I quit. And the overwhelming majority don't know about my addiction, nor do they have to. But they will instinctively respond to my new attitude & energy.

Conversely, I will cease to attract the energy of people with behaviours I no longer want. This will create what's known as ""a virtuous circle"" - where you cycle around, and around, as good energy flows out, and then good energy flows in.

I am not willfully cutting people ""out"". Just giving off a different vibe as I get more sober every week / month, and journaling changes. I will be interested to read back and see if /when I sense a sea-change in the kind of energy I attract.",56,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5082358}"

Having over a year and half of sober living experience its become clear to me that, with, or without weed - life can be hard. Motivating myself to do things can be a challenge sometimes. I tend to go through cycles where I feel great and other times where things bother me a bit more. This is no different than when I was a daily stoner. 

Did my life change after quitting weed? You bet it did, but it wasn't simply stopping weed that made it change. It was the effort I put into my life to make a change, to make things better. I figured out the things I didn't like about myself and set out to make a difference in those areas. Some of that was successfully, some partially successful and some I am still working on. I see life now as an endless evolution of self improvement. Some steps will be forward, and some backwards.

Getting weed out of my life didn't magically just make everything in my life fall into place. One thing is for sure though, letting go of all the baggage that came along with being an addict was very freeing. Freeing in that I wasn't dealing with all the negative thoughts about myself and direction in life because I was high all the time. Freedom of clarity of mind to make my *own* choices without any outside influence. 

Without weed I have to be strong and face what I encounter in life's journey. I have to learn skills and strategies to cope and deal with what it is I need to face and overcome. Having faced the burden of addiction makes many of life's problems pale in comparison. I think that gives former addicts an advantage of sorts. Be proud of yourself for accomplishing such a feat. Sometimes it's easy to lose sight of the bigger picture, where you came from, what you've been through. Sometimes its easy to just focus on the little things that are in front of you at the moment. I have to remind myself sometimes to put the challenges I'm facing into my overall life context. The progress that has been made cannot be forgotten.

The most important part of self improvement, I think, is learning to love yourself. Love yourself if you are addicted to weed, or have quit. The chances of you actually being conceived and making it this far depended on so many stars aligning. For literally billions of years things had to go a very certain way to lead to you being here, almost an impossibility.",101,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5256169}"

It's understandable to want to avoid pain, it's human nature. It's so tempting just want the pain to be over and pretend the underlying problems don't exist. I want to just accept that I made bad decisions and accept that whatever mistakes I've made were because I was in pain.

I see a lot of people in here who quit like myself who end up feeling horrible after smoking weed for months even years. Regret, shame, depression, anxiety, boredom, hopelessness... can be really overwhelming and it's really tempting to want to just escape it. Rather than trying to just accept the pain and confront the root cause to my feelings I've been trying to run away from it. It'd be one thing if it worked but clearly it just makes the problem worse.

Made it a half a year, then pandemic hit. Made it a month and a half then just ""didn't feel like it."" Every time I quit it gets a little easier, but staying committed is hard. Fighting against the cravings and the excuses ""oh its vacation"" ""I'm bored"" whatever make smoking seem like a good idea is fucking hard and a real hurdle to overcome if you've been self medicating with weed.

If you're upset, lonely, depressed it can be really painful to admit that you've got a problem and hold yourself accountable to try and fix it. It's so much easier to just do nothing and try to ignore it then take it seriously and put in effort (even if that effort fails for a long time.) I wish that I could go back to childhood and give myself a hug and say there's nothing wrong with me. To say that I was mistreated and it's OK to be lonely, sad, confused, upset and not judge myself for it.

Being stuck in negativity blocked me from positivity. I didn't even consider the fact that I could apply myself, put in the hard work required and actually feel good about it and make progress. I'm 34 now and I've had some success but a lot of failure. I worry about money, I self isolate, give in to depression, avoid reaching out to people and taking care of myself. It's time I hold myself accountable, accept that the past is the past and open myself up to the pain instead of hiding from it.

Hopefully this rant will help someone going through similar struggles that it's OK to feel sad, cry, be anxious, depressed or suicidal. Just accepting your feelings is a good thing, judging yourself for them is the real problem. It's actually a good thing to feel your feelings, even if you feel like complete dog shit for decades. Living in regret, judging yourself for screwing up is not something to hide from. No matter what happened it's OK, but it's time to hold yourself accountable for running from the responsibilities of taking better care of yourself.",3,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5809313}"

I have a scheduled medical in February 14th and it will probably include a standard urine test (the simple kind, just dip and observe, so no sending it off to a lab).
By then I will be off the herbs for around 40 days. I wonder if if will still show up as I read that the longer you use, the longer it will show up.
I smoked about 2 joints per evening, (4 between the missus and me) not too strong about 50/50 tobacco, but I'm pretty skinny and have little to no body fat (6.1ft and about 135 pounds), do you guys (and gals) think I'm good to go by then?
I stress a lot about things so by now I'm  already worrying about it and would love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

I've been smoking everyday (roughly 16 bowls a day) since August of 2020 and that's also when my nicotine addiction started. I started to notice recently that my days and thoughts were revolved around when I would smoke next and I know that because of my addiction I've felt such a curb in my motivation and enthusiasm to do anything. I dropped out of college because I couldn't really afford it and I became highly anxious and depressed. I kept my nicotine addiction a secret from my gf because she doesn't want me to fall into that cycle, and that secrecy made me feel gross and not myself. I constantly hear from people I knew before I started smoking tell me that I've changed and how I used to be so much more sociable and excitable and it's become hard to hear. Recently I ran out of weed and threw my last cigs away and started my journey on sobering up. So far the cravings haven't been too bad but I have a very difficult time falling asleep and I've noticed a loss of appetite. The thing I struggle with the most is finding activities to keep me occupied while I'm home. I like to make music but since I've quit I have a hard time getting myself to do it. I think I need a new hobby to occupy the time I spent smoking. So far nothing has peaked my interest. I'm gonna try reading at least 30 minutes a day and I'm looking into climbing again or trying out muay thai at a local gym. I think a big concern of mine is the surge of Covid cases spiking everywhere and so doing things outside of work and being home feels wrong. I'm also tight on money so I can't afford memberships at gyms. I quit my job at a weed themed sandwich place and think that will help me quit. My goal this year is to get my CNA certification so I can work towards possibly going back to school to become a RN. Just typing this out has been mildly therapeutic and finding this page has also been encouraging. Thank you for the space to vent and tell my story. I haven't smoked in 3 days and I hope I can keep going. If any of y'all have advice or insight on activities to replace the time I spent smoking I'd really appreciate it!",6,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5674168}"

I’ve been smoking regularly since august of 2021. Mainly carts, some black market some potent dispos that were 94% thc . I started off with smoking once a week which turned into everyday. I took tolerance breaks before, usually 1 week. During those breaks i got a fast heart beat, mild depression, sweating, and a lack of appetite. I always caved in at the 6-7 day mark because i was at a party. This time i got food poisoning and honestly thought i was gonna die for some reason so i decided to take a break. I’m on day 4 and just have felt off, way worse than other t breaks. I’m pretty sure it’s because of that very potent cart. I was at the gym for the first time in 2 weeks and it was honestly too much for me. I started crying and went to the bathroom stall to throw up. I called my mom on the way home to tell her everything. Right now i’m sitting on the couch with my sister crying. I don’t feel right at all, mild dr/dp symptoms and my heart is racing again.

I’ve been sober for a month now. I feel better in the sense that I’m more alert, more aware of my emotions, and less foggy. I suffer from CPTSD and weed was always my savior from it. It stopped my nightmares and let me sleep, and calmed me down when I would have rage episodes. I have also spent time in a gang where I was frequently in high intensity situations and trying to adjust to normal life after leaving(left 3 yrs ago) the gang is difficult. Similar to soldiers struggling to adjust after war;i left the war, but the war never left me. Weed helped keep up with that intensity and made me feel more normal.

I’ve tried new hobbies, but they aren’t intense enough for what I’m used to. For example, I already do large amount of physical exercise daily which does not help.

It’s hard to sleep through the night with trauma nightmares and I’m not as rested.

Another time I was sober for two months, I made new friends and got a girlfriend, but it was unfilfilling and couldn’t match the intensity I was used to. I also made friends and romantic relationships when I was smoking more frequently than when I stopped.

2022-01-13 16:16:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/s39vtj/my_effective_strategy_for_quitting/,My Effective Strategy for Quitting,"I quit at the start of December, had one slip up and smoked for a week. I am back on track and have developed a pretty fool proof plan for quitting. I am confident I will not return to weed again. 

1) Remove all of your marijuana related things. Bongs, rigs, e-nails, weed, shatter, joints. Don't skip anything, remove everything. Yes you are throwing money away, but that is just motivation to not buy any more marijuana/marijuana related things.  

2) If you slip up, feel bad about it and throw what you purchased out as soon as you are able.  

3) Write down all of the horrible things you feel when you smoke. ""Makes me lazy"" ""Makes me bad at video games"" ""Ruins my relationships"" ""Makes me tired"" ""Gives me anxiety"" These are a few examples, figure out some that apply to you. Consult this list when you have an overwhelming urge to smoke. 

4) Clean up your living space. Around our houses are tons of triggers that make us want to smoke. Go to where you used to store your weed, and completely clean it. Transform it into a new space that has nothing to do with weed. I stored my weed in a drawer at my desk, looking at it or even being near it was a trigger for me. I cleaned it until it was spotless, and in the drawer I left a bag of sour watermelon gummy candies. Every time I have an overwhelming urge to smoke, I open the drawer, take one candy, and forget about it. I got this idea from a book called, ""The Wind up Bird Chronicle"" where the main character uses lemon drops to help him quit smoking cigarettes. it's strange but it works for me.

5) Find new activities. When we are bored, smoking seems like a logical thing to do to fill the time. Instead of smoking, find an activity to keep you occupied instead. Take a walk, queue a match of a competitive video game, read a book, go to the gym, go out with a friend, enroll in a class of your choosing. Finding something to keep you occupied almost effortlessly gets your mind off of marijuana.  

6) Never assume that you can return and smoke in moderation. This is a common pitfall and it has happened to me countless times. You are quitting for good. Do not forget that.  

7) Remember that the first 2 months are BY FAR the hardest. Quitting weed only gets easier the longer you are away from it. The first month can be hell, but no matter how garbage you feel, remember that you will feel much better in general if you are free from marijuana. The withdrawal symptoms will go away, and a few months later, your urges will stop almost entirely.  

8) Identify your triggers. Boredom? Certain time of day? Emotional state? Become mindful and aware of these triggers. Circumvent these triggers using the info in #5.

Today I have reached 1 year without smoking weed. One year! It feels so good to be able to say this! Today I have been reflecting over how this last year has been. 2021 was in so many ways a difficult year, but also such a great year for me personally. First, I finished my university degree that took me four years to complete. Midway in my education, I was forced to take a look at my life and why I was smoking. My education forced me to take a look at my own traumatic background. This hit me so hard, that not even weed could numb the pain. I was lucky and had some great people in my study group that saw this, and literally “forced” me to get professional help. Without them doing so and the great support from my boyfriend, I would never have finished my education. I decided to quit weed back then and managed to stay away from it for about six months, but ended up smoking again. Not as often as I did before, but still on a regular basis. Of course, that made me feel like shit again...

In January 2021 I started group therapy and decided again to quit. I wanted to be clear headed while going in therapy. And I am so glad I did it. The group therapy helped me so much, and when it finished in the spring, I continued one to one therapy for 6 month, and in December I finished my therapy all together.

I believe quitting weed was one of the main reasons I am as I am today. My life is so much better. Yes, it was so hard at times, and still is. I had to work really hard to get here, but I know I can do the things I set my mind to. In 2021 I quit weed, I finished my degree, I got my dream job and I also finished my time as a psychiatric patient. All of them being such big milestones for me!!

Greetings , I am a 20 years old who have been smoking pretty frequently for the last 7/8 months, I used to work a physically taxing job so I would smoke a joint a day at night when I was done, but I had a few times where I had vacation time and I spent a good chunk of it being high 24/7 and it was with higher dosages of THC, including getting a pen and 2 carts around a month ago, and now last Saturday I decided to quit. 

I am still having some appetite issues and insomnia is less of a problem, but now whenever I sleep I keep waking up literally screaming from nightmares about past trauma and bad childhood experiences growing up, but they feel so real and inescapable it is like I am actually there, I am not even conscious to the fact it is a dream. 

It has been stressing me out to the point I decided to ditch sleep the last 2 nights all together after every time this happened and stay up all day, which turned me to a zombie.

The withdrawals like nightmares, sweating profusely and not feeling like myself seem like a distant memory now, even though it's been just 4 months. So I started wondering what happened... What changed?


So the first few weeks to a month was really shitty where often at night I woke up screaming from nightmares. I was sweating profusely, which sucked cause I started a new job. I was feeling off and not like myself at all, which is hard when you're meeting a lot of new people at work. 


After the first month and once the withdrawal symptoms flowed away the cravings began, they weren't always there, but when I was bored and sitting on the couch I could feel them come up. I felt like smoking and often told myself ""1 joint or bong hit isn't going to hurt me, I've already proven I can quit and can quit again if I want to"". I didn't give in, but it was very difficult at times. Whenever life hits me in the face, smoking was a way to cope. This coping mechanism fell away, so now I had to deal with these issues in another way. Meditation was my answer, I've been following Buddhism also for the last 8 years around the time I started smoking. But often I felt to jitterish or anxious to meditate. I still kept on going and meditated anyway, even 1 minute of meditation was better than no meditation.


After the first 2 months the craving gradually became less and less. They where still there, but went away after a few mins. Directing my attention towards something else was key here for me personally. I started getting more into old hobbies like whittling and gaming, which helped a lot, but a lot of times I felt bored out of my mind when doing this, but I still kept on going and finishing a whittle or game always gave me a sense of accomplishment which in turn made me not give up on these hobby's.


But something occured to me, during my quitting process I started to get more into tea. I've always drank tea since I was younger. And when I smoked I got more into loose tea like gunpowder tea or sencha tea. I joined some subreddits and was blown away. 


""Wait what, what is Oolong tea?"", ""What? Black tea that's been roasted and smells like smoked salmon and taste like smokey bourbon/whiskey?"". I got more into it. As in what kinds of tea are there, how does the region it's grown affect the taste, why the small cups, etc. It was mind boggling at first, but very rewarding to me in a way as it gave me something to do with my free time (research) and to work to (buying and tasting). After the loose teas I found out about Pu-Erh tea, which are pressed tea bricks or cakes that are fermented, sometimes for years and years. This is a whole new level, a hobby within a hobby so to say. The tastes of Pu-Erh are insane, really good and diverse. I even keep a notepad handy to write notes in about what I think of a particular tea, so I know which one I want to order, and to not get lost in all the different kinds of tea that's being offered.


Anyway, I guess what I wanted to say is that it doesn't matter how long you're sober, try to find a passion to put your time and effort in. Something you love and to invest in, money and time wise. It's just stupid to think that something as silly as tea helped me a great deal to overcome smoking weed daily. And yes I still have cravings from time to time, but they have less impact I've noticed, they flow away quicker and are less severe. I also don't know if I quit smoking forever, but for now and the coming days I have no intention to start again.


Sorry for the long story and possible bad grammar used, I just wanted this of my chest and if I can motivate at least one person to quit smoking or help them on their way I'm happy. I still have a long way to go to fix every problem I've tried to smoke away (or created by smoking), but I have came a long way as well and realise that now.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48224849}"

Me and the missus went cold turkey 12 days ago after smoking daily for 14 years.
My reasons were (are) the kids growing up and fear of testing positive at work or in traffic.
We moved in together at age 18 and 16, I went to work and the missus finished school and did the same. We build up a life but practically since the beginning of our relationship we smoked, only during the evenings but daily.
For the aforementioned reasons we decided to quit, but things are very boring for me, I'm at home atm due to burnout/depression but starting again in 2 weeks.
I have tendency to overthink and stress, I always fear the worst will happen and have low self esteem.
It's going good all in all but the evenings aren't the same anymore, we used to take a smoke break once an hour, hour and a half but since that's gone I feel like time passes very slowly. We watch TV whi'e having a drink and talk a bit or I rub her feet or back like usual..

Cold turkey is hard but it felt like the only option, I grew my own and we decided to stop once we finished the last batch.

Just want to vent, maybe people have the same experience? I'm not in the mood for sex, I thought that would increase once we stopped but I feel like I'm too sober, I worry about not performing (always have) and therefore struggle sometimes to reach an orgasm (about 5% of the times), I fear being too sober will increase this worry.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5368388}"

Why did I quit after a quarter of a century? I loved everything about being a stoner, but I knew it was holding me back in my life. It made me lazy and for most of my life I did and achieved very little. As the metaphor says, I wanted to remove the wet rag from my face. I wanted to step out of the fog & into the daylight to find out who I really am. I wanted to have some achievements, focus on my health, fitness and loved ones for the first time in my life instead of my only thought being where and when my next joint will be smoked. So I quit. It wasn't easy, but not as hard as I expected.

I'm reaping all of the rewards and feeling all the benefits that I expected to. I have more energy, I'm more alert, I've achieved more in the last 5 months than the previous 10 years. I also quit tobacco and alcohol. I'm healthier. For the first time in my life I do regular exercise which I enjoy. I have more attention for my children. 

But......

.......something is missing in my life. I miss the buzz. The feeling of that first drag of the joint that I've been waiting hours for. I have nothing to look forward to at the end of the working day. (I know I have all the benefits of quitting that I mentioned, but it's not the same.)

I wouldn't say I am severely depressed, but I'm not feeling the joy of being sobre, the excitement from my new achievements, the sense of pride and accomplishment that I expected. I have a grey cloud following me around everywhere, even when it's sunny. It's as if all the benefits of my new sobre life, will never be enough to replace the feeling of being high. I don't have constant strong cravings to get high, but I just miss it terribly, in spite of knowing how it held me back in so many ways.

I'm not going to crack and smoke a joint in a moment of weakness that I will immediately regret. But I find myself comparing the advantages of quitting with the pleasure and sense of contentment that smoking gave me for such a big part of my life.
I'm seriously thinking about what to do here.
Yes I wanted to quit, but not if I'll be miserable for the rest of my life.

The only people that will truly be able to give me advice on this, are those who smoked regularly for at least 10 plus years and who are clean for at least 6 months or more.

Is what I'm describing familiar?

After 25 years, is 5 months too soon to expect to feel so happy and joyful with being sobre?

I heard someone say that to totally free yourself, you need one month sobre fore every year you smoked. In my case, that means 2 years until I feel normal! Is there any truth in this?

Your thoughts and experiences will be very much appreciated! 

Thank you so much and good luck to everyone out there, wherever you are on your journey.

Ever since then, I had my highs and lows with it, but generally I’ve always loved weed and used it for expanding my mind. 

In the past year or so, I’ve noticed when I was happy and wanted to celebrate, I would smoke. When I was sad and depressed, I would smoke to make myself feel better. Sometimes just a bowl before I went to bed or sometimes start smoking as soon as I woke up. I’ve been out of work for a couple months and whenever I would smoke, I would feel like a loser. I’ve felt my relationships with people aren’t as strong as they used to be - may be me being an introvert, but I can’t help but feel that weed is hindering me from expressing who I really am. I’ve always gotten pretty anxious when smoking, but lately it feels like I’m too in my head thinking about thinking and I can’t even enjoy my high.

I decided I wasn’t going to smoke this week and only smoke on the weekends. But I’ve made it three days clean and I feel the best I have felt in years!!! I feel focused - I’m getting so much done around the house, I’m being more present with the people in my life, and generally just tons of energy.

I'm taking a small 5 minute breather from working out and I decided to weigh myself. I've always been a skinny person.. I'm 5'11 and I don't weigh much at all. Just a little under a month ago I stepped on the scale and clocked in at 131 pounds. Yeah.

I don't feel unhealthy or anything like that, but my relationship with food definitely was. I would only eat once a day, and I'd only do it after smoking all day and being as high as possible... Even then I wasn't eating because I wanted to, I was eating because I knew I had to.

Even when stoned food was gross to me. I had to force down everything I was eating and I only did it because I knew I I didnt eat something for the day it was gonna be even more detrimental to my health than the stuff I was already doing.

I was under the influence of other substances too, but cannabis was the main one that fucked up my appetite.

I step on the scale a couple moments ago and clocked in at 136 pounds. I honestly couldn't believe it. I knew I was eating better and eating more often... I can even see the new muscle growth from working out and it's just making me feel even more accomplished.

It's amazing what drugs take away from you. About 6 years ago I weighed 210 pounds.. I was 16. And somehow I didn't completely ruin my body by losing almost half my weight. That I am greatful for.

I think a lot of people misunderstand how cannabis can affect the appetite.. and sure, while it might give you the munchies.. eventually that feeling turns into food being gross when even remotely sober.. and the only way to get an apatite is from smoking weed.

I'm happy I finally broke the chain. It's still hard some days. I still wake up and think ""a bowl of weed would be great right now"" but I know it isn't going to do anything but fuck me up further.

I wrote (day 27) in my post, but in all honesty I smoked about 6 days ago. And I hated it. I went into a full blown panic attack, had a nervous breakdown, cried, and beg my dad to never ever smoke weed with me again (as he smokes everyday)

My dad is very supportive of me, he won't smoke around me anymore, and doesn't even really mention it to me. But I've realized I can even smoke weed if I want to. The high that I used to have doesn't exist anymore. And it's been replace with an awful, terrifying feeling... And honestly, it might sound weird, but I'm greatful for that too. I'm happy I can't smoke weed anymore.. it never helped me to begin with.

Thanks for reading if anyone did. Just know if you are on day 1 or just trying to quit smoking... It is possible. And you don't need it. I lied to myself for so many years... Smoking as soon as I woke up, before I went to work, and before I even left the house. I thought I needed it. I was so wrong. Life is beautiful and worth it again.

Have a good night guys, I got about another half hour worth of working out to do and some more studying for college. If anyone wants to talk about stuff related to quiting, you can reach out in my DMs. I'll listen and possibly relate to what you are going through.

I don’t even enjoy being high anymore. I get anxious and paranoid and regularly overthink. 

I just feel completely uninspired in life, and the least I can do is try quitting weed. I can’t think of any other reason why I’d be uninspired- I’ve got a lovely girlfriend, great family and a great group of mates. I just feel like I need to get the old me back.

Anyway. I will update you all in a month, if anyone is interested. Quitting weed is a huge thing for me anyway, as the last 3 years I’ve been stoned all day.

2022-01-12 18:03:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/s2jnz6/day_three/,Day three,"Heij everyone,

I am currently on day three of not smoking any weed and tobacco. I'm a 33 y/o Dutch guy and smoking weed with tobacco is commonplace. I have smoked daily since I was 21. 

It's hard for me to quit. Because my life started to turn around for the better when I started smoking weed. I've had a rough youth and only when I left high school at about 18 my life started getting better. Weed came in not long after that and I have achieved a lot since then. 

Finished my school, worked in that sector for 4 years, came to the conclusion that this isn't 'it' for the the rest of my life, picked up a totally different career path, finished with the best grades I've ever had in any education, landed a job at the other end of the country even before graduating(I wanted to get out of that specific part of the Netherlands), rented a house and 1,5 years later bought a house, gotten my motorcycle license, found amazing friends in my new town, renovated my house, buiot my first motorcycle...

I can carry on, but the gist of it is, I have done a lot of good things while high, or during the period I smoked. I haven't sat down and was content, like I hear a lot from friends who used to smoke.

Back to 2021. I've found a great friend. She and I connect in this weird manner ever since we met. Like 2 pieces of 16 X 16 Lego clicking together. Like we've known each other for ever. 
She wants to have kids. For that she and her husband need to quit smoking weed and tobacco. I've decided to quit along side them. Somewhere around october 2021 I decided I'd join in. We were to quit at the 10th of januari, after one of our birthdays. I thought I did it for them, to help them. I thought: ""Might as well quit, it's a costly hobby but it also has been good. It's time for a new thing.""

Today marks day 3. I have gradually stopped smoking cigarettes towards the 10th of January, and have quit them all together in November. Not really missing them. But then, the weed. That's something different. That's something to get used too. A new life so to speak.

I have quit before, for a couple of months at most. And I've started again. The thing I hated the most was the first night. Sleeplessness and nightmares. But this time something's different. I'm not sure why, but it feels different. Maybe it's because I have two friends to quit with and motivate each other. Maybe it's my friend who keeps sending me reminders why it's good (Thank you Tov, your help is appreciated greatly, and that's an understatement). Maybe it's the motivation to have more breath during sports, because my body can continue, but my lungs don't keep up. I've been doing some serious bag training since two years and I can't remember when I went sober. Not to toot my own horn but I've been told on multiple occasions I'm crazy for my intense participation in the lessons. Always fighting my own limits and not those set by the trainer. Pushing myself further and further. Since Corona I have built a home gym and continue this practice, alone or with 2 friends. My body is going where I want it to be just before another lockdown. I had to keep going, and I am going.

I've slept like shit last two nights and I'm not sure how coming night will go, but no nightmares so far. I've seen every hour the first night and the second (except 5 am for some reason). But I feel more rested as with weed. 

Something's different this time around.

Tonight was tough. A friend of mine was here. He smokes cigs and weed. I really wanted. Really. Knowing I would regret it not 5 minutes after, I did not smoke. He was kind enough to leave his weed but he still smoked a cig. I smelled the tobacco and it was good. 

I made it. Day 3 is a succes.

Day 4, prepare yourself. I am coming and not giving up. My mind feels more clear, like a fog has lifted. I feel less confused and less tense. When my alarm goes in the morning I don't feel groggy. Time feels... Different. Work feels more structured. Conversations go easier and seem to hold more meaning. Reading books is easier with less re reading of pages. Music I have listened to for years and decades sound and feel completely different to me. Like new. 

But, what surprised me most, was day 2, sporting. My lungs already felt better, but the training felt easier without weed as with. Somehow I figured it would be more difficult. It didn't. 

I can do this. It will be hard and unsurmountable at times, but I can do this.

You can do this.

If a loser like me can do it, *so can you.*

The first step is the hardest. Believe in yourself. Believe in a better tommorow for yourself.

Hit me up if you need someone to talk to.

Big hugs from a Dutch guy.

You probably all know the stoner anthem smoke weed everyday by snoop dogg. In his most recent album John Legend used the beat on ""Actions"" and transformed it into something beautiful in my opinion. He transformed a triggering song into something that I can still enjoy without the direct association to that damn lettuce. This might still be triggering to some people, so take care. I generally think it's worthwhile to avoid triggering places, songs, people whatever it is that triggers your compulsion, but depending on what it is, letting the triggering medium evolve into something new might help as well.
While the song might not be about addictions, it does still resonate with me when I put it into the context of my addictive tendencies, as I write lists of goals, posts on reddit or letters to myself attempting to leave my bad habits behind me, but ultimately fail, because I only ""write love songs"" instead of truly taking action.
Of course the writing is very helpful, but it takes more than words to beat these demons, for me at least.

I had tried to quit multiple times throughout the years and always ended up going back and I didn’t know why.

As I was scrolling through tik tok I saw someone mention this subreddit and I figured I’d check it out. After reading other peoples stories about quitting I came to the realization that it wasn’t about how the weed made me feel but instead it was what it didn’t make me feel. I was using weed as a way to forget about all of my past traumas. (close family member passing, relationship problems, etc.) Although I would constantly tell myself when I was smoking that it was “just something to do when I’m bored” I knew that wasn’t the truth but I guess for some reason I couldn’t bring myself to accept the real reason I was using marijuana. I guess the point I’m trying to convey is that some of you on this platform helped to show me that there are many other people out there going through the same things I am going through. Knowing that there are people out there going through the same thing made it tremendously easier to quit and I started to deal with my problems instead of just using weed to ignore them. Things are looking up and I’ve grown much closer in relationships with family members and friends who forgot about what I was like when I’m sober.

I have recently lost my job so money is tight but I got around £180 in Christmas money so having cash on hand, I thought I would get some bud to help with my medication withdrawal. I brought 7g for £70 which is already a ridiculous price but I was just happy to have some. 

When I smoked it it felt amazing but I immediately fell into guilt and self loathing. This did not stop me though as I smoked all 7 grams in a matter of days and then bought another 7g meaning I had spent £140 of my £180 on weed.

Today is my first day in hopefully a long journey of being clean. 
I know its only been one full day of not smoking, but I find I am already missing it because it was like my little reward after a long day or completing tasks. It took me a long time to decide to do this and finally throw out my stuff and I am motivated not to go back! I have even got my partner on board to help. 

However, that signal to my body to decompress my day and that feeling of being rewarded all the time is blatantly missing now. I also had been spliffing tobacco with the leaves so I find im antsy and just wandering around. 

I would love to find a healthy solution! I am nervous that this lack of a decompressor/reward at the end of the day or when I finish large tasks will cause me to start smoking again. Obviously having sweets or beer is just replacing one harmful habit with another although that was the only thing I can think of... 

Has anyone smoked in a similar method and successfully replaced this constant need for a ""reward""??

Or that sometime in the future I will go back, with more self control and more discipline to ensure I won't let it take over my life again. 
All I need to do is break the habit and reset right? Wrong. 


When I originally quit, my highs were maybe 30% each day. If I decide to ingest any form of THC after such a long break however, the high is going to be fantastic, a 120+% feeling high. Which means the cravings for the weed will be WAY MORE than back when I broke the habit, which was hard enough as it is, but those initially lasted 1-2 weeks. Yet experiencing a godlike high and then abstaining, it'll likely be a month+ before the cravings subside. 


Tldr: the longer the break, the better the highs, the more craving you'll get from getting high vs back when your highs were subpar yet it was still hard to quit.",52,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44161442}"

I’m promising myself that today is Day 1 again, but I’ve lost so much confidence in myself. I don’t know if I can even stick to the first day anymore. 

The day time is easy. It’s after work that I start to really struggle. I can’t seem to find a way to relax. I don’t want to replace weed with another substance (e.g. alcohol), but that’s what seems to happen when I give it up. 

Weed also makes sex infinitely more enjoyable. I’ve had some of the best orgasms of my whole life when stoned, and I don’t know how to go back to regular sex without being under the influence of it.

Both were tough to beat and I had tried for years. My booze addiction was a little less clingy for a few reasons making weed the more difficult of the two. 

One of those reasons is that I started using weed at a pretty young age, 13 was my first experience. It was pretty magical, and innocent, at the time. Over the next few years it became a bigger and bigger part of my life. It guided my life in a lot of significant ways. It became something I did with friends - it was the central and key activity that our time shared together revolved around. As time went on and I used it more and more it became a priority to make sure I had the supply I needed.

I attribute starting at such an early age to being a major contributor for the level of addiction that eventually developed. Weed got in the way of my young mind seeing what was really important in life or exploring all that life had to offer. Little did I realize what I was setting myself up for.

Thought patterns emerged from that early behavior. Thought patterns that gave weed and getting high an importance in life. Everything else became second. It was almost like water, you don't really think much about water until you need some and there isn't any there. It's just such a crucial part of your existence. 

Running out of weed or not having any for almost any occasion would turn that occasion into a terrible experience. I couldn't focus, I could relax. Without weed I just couldn't enjoy myself or be happy in life.

Having this attitude and this view over many years solidified the importance of weed and made it a big part of my life. It was hard to see myself as anything but a stoner. A sober life, a sober me seemed impossible.",20,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4381802}"

I’m 17 days sober now and overall I’m doing better - the brain fog is gone, my interest in hobbies is returning, my work performance is better, and I’ve lost nearly 10lbs from eating healthier and exercising. 

But damn it feels like I’m on a nonstop emotional roller coaster that’s been getting worse the last few days. In the space of five minutes I’ll feel happy, anxious, sad, angry, and everything in between. I feel so emotionally fragile and like I have no ability to sort through these emotions, despite having all the tools I need from therapy. (I recently went to therapy for over a year to work through 10+ years of anxiety and depression, and I found therapy to be extremely helpful for me.) My weed use was solely recreational and I never consciously used it to self medicate, but it seems like suppressing my emotions was an unintentional side effect that I now have to work through.

Idk I’m sure this post will get buried…I just hope I’m not the only person that feels this way. I’ll probably set up an appointment with my therapist in a couple weeks if this emotional roller coaster doesn’t calm down by then.

I know logically that smoking again won’t fix this, but damn it is tempting to take a couple hits just to feel emotionally stable for a little bit. Trying my best to stay strong 💪",39,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.55826205}"

I need some advice about quitting weed while studying in a new place. After almost four years of daily black market cartridge vaping, and going though about 1.5-2g every week, I need to quit. I was a month sober right before the pandemic kicked in as I was in the hospital with pneumonia. Never told anyone that I smoked, but went through the first week of withdrawals inpatient while battling low O2 saturation (low 80s 70s, I am 20). Therefore, I don’t really remember what the withdrawals were like or if they were really a result of the pneumonia. I do remember it was living hell and than I wanted to die. Anyways, Since I have tried to quit many times but never made it longer than 24-48 hours. 

I am going to a foreign country without weed for 2 months to study, but I am very worried my withdrawal symptoms will make finding friends during the first week (orientation week and 4 days sober for me if I stop today) very hard, as well as group bus rides to daily travel excursions/activities, and group meals with faculty. Of course I could do all of this high no problem, but I am scared and nervous of the person I will publicly portray as I start to get sober. I tend to be very very irritable, nauseated, and a terrible sleeper without frequent weed use. AND, despite being in an illegal country, I have faith I could get my hands on it if I was desperate enough.

I know that I should use this travel as an opportunity to quit, but I am scared and on the verge of bringing carts on an international flight, so please give me advice to make the idea of quitting sound easier for me. I would like specific advice about how to go about study abroad orientation, make friends, and live on my own in a completely new place while starting to take uni classes, all while quitting high% thc carts. Additionally, any help on handling these facts *while quitting* would be great:

Life is great on paper (have amazing grades, resume, LORs but did it all while high)

Money is not an inhibiting factor when buying

Managing relationship with SO, especially long distance

I finally decided to quit smoking for numerous reasons. Me and the missus smoked daily for about 15 years. At the start about 1 or 2 a day (always in the evening), last 6~7 years about 3 to 4 a day for the two of us, so about 2 per person. It was kind of our thing chilling in the evening to relax, watch some TV.
The last years I was getting more anxious, work started doing tests every year as part of the medical screening, and our oldest son is getting older and we didn't want him noticing. I have a tendency towards overthinking and worrying a lot about things, and around new year we decided to flip the switch. 
It's going quite well, stopped cold turkey, but I especially am still searching for my new routine, I'm a creature of habit and feel kind of bored in the evenings, not craving the weed so much but craving the habit.
I really don't have a place to discuss this so I thought I'd write it down here.
Physically I sweated quite a lot at night but that seemed to have died down, mentally I'm doing ok but I try to not think about it as much.

Sorry for the long post, I hope you guys will understand the struggle.
Not about to restart bc I don't want to spend the money on it (I grew my own) and I think it's better for my mental health since I don't have to worry anymore about the risk of having to do a sliva test on the road of psising positive at work).

Now, my job is discussing possibly *not* giving us the raise they promised us, I might need to move back in with my parents after the lease is over, my partner is sick and hasn't been able to clean which is making me depressed (they're stay at home, we have a system worked out. I clean too but work full time). All the sudden this last week no matter how much sleep I get, I'm exhausted, the motivation and drive to exercise and keep my positive habits are gone, and I've been having intense drug cravings (I call them moments of insanity) 

The urge to smoke a bowl, just get fucked up and out of my head is SO strong right now. The urges come in waves, and I'm getting so exhausted and worn down from standing strong. I want to just lie back and let the ocean sweep me away, but I know I will have another painstaking 24 days before I get back to where I was. And 1 relapse for me can easily turn into a week long binge.

It could be a combo of all those things.

So I was with a friend during the entire day and we had much fun, he was smoking and I didn’t have a single crave which was amazing. Maybe it was due to the tobacco added  (quit that crap years ago). 
Then I came home and my wife’s weed just smelled SO FUCKING GOOD.  It smelled completely different from the last time I touched it (quit five days ago). It had that peppery afghani smell like the weed I used to buy in matchboxes… The smell instantly took me back to my first teenage highs. You know, those super funny, feel-good highs that can be achieved only in the first few times that you use it…  After giving it some (crooked-by-drug-seeking-behavior) thought, I filled myself a bowl, took the lighter. And then I thought about how much time I spent on weed during the two decades of abuse. Time is one of the few resources that fee truly finite to me. I got so angry. I wanted to toss the bong out of the window. Or break it on my stupid head to snap out of it. I think I had a rage induced out of body experience there for a second. Saw myself from above with the bong sitting on the couch with my pot belly sticking out. Man, I felt the stress hormones flooding my body at that instance. But then it came to me - weed will not make this stress go away. It will only make me more pissed. I recalled that I quit and intend to stay quitted. Reading the relapse stories on r/leaves helped so much to reinforce this idea so thank you relapsers for sharing!
This whole thing took less than 30 seconds. But it was intense. Eventually, I just passed the bong to my wife (who was oblivious to my internal rage process). Phew! That was a close call.

So, I've been smoking from age 17 - 22 daily due to lack of obligations and the crowd I'm hanging out with.
After some time in the cloud I started to notice some consequences so I enrolled in Erasmus in Rome to get away for a while: and it was honestly one of the best decisions I've made in my conscious life - not Erasmus, but decision to get rid of my addiction... ok maybe Rome too - It's fkin amazing. 
Here I haven't been in contact with any smokers whatsoever hence I didn't even feel much of a need to engage in rolling dat sweet kush. I went with a purpose to gain some independence over my choices and actions and have some fun during the period.

Why stop smoking? Oh boi:

• Social anxiety - overthinking, loss of self-confidence,   loosing honesty towards close people
 ( need to express true feelings towards any situation )

• Lack of self-awareness
It's too easy to get in the ""loop"" while frequently high

• Loss of emotional capability - messed with my relationships and ability to feel joy of life or basically anything

• Lack of sexual drive

• Loss of empathy ( quite noticable as an originally empathic person )

• Time-wasting... a lot of it.

• Forgetfulness - I basically can't invoke memory of all the fun hs / college / summer experiences I went through - although I get a flashback when someone else reminds me of it ever happening.
Waking up every day as if I had nothing planned,  avoiding my duties. (also Hedgehog Day type stuff)

• Weightloss ( no will to cook or get up for breakfast, stopped exercising )

• Low-energy: living on low battery mode / groginess / hard time getting up in the morning

• Stupid decisions - Note that this experience is combined with getting drunk 3+ times a week, so take combination of substances used into consideration.

• On top of all I get red eyes after couple of puffs and combined with not being able to fall asleep I didn't look healthy most of the time.... also sometimes looked like an idiot high at places I maybe shouldn't have been.

- For further notice, keep in mind my sleeping schedule revolved around going to sleep at 4:20am since 17 years old ( not on purpose but as a concequence ),
I rarely went to sleep before 3am.
____________________________________________________

Getting sober:

 - Week 1-2: Easier to fall asleep but waking up in the middle of the night covered in cold sweat. Weird hyper-realistic dreams ( like never before ).
Having trouble denying joints in social surroundings but still managing to do so. Tobacco cravings. Thinking about smoking every day but actually realising that was an argument for being addicted
 (at this point I was still home - not on Erasmus) and one of the reasons I decided on this.

 ~ 1 Month in: Brain fog gets cleared a little bit but I feel like a different person, sometimes even more confused than when high - like you're learning to be yourself back again - starting from 18yr old standpoint.
More social engagements and higher levels of energy.
Tobacco cravings still existant.

- 2/3 Months in: Same as month 1., it's just getting easier and easier with time not to smoke and forget about ever indulging in it. Sleep schedule fixed a little bit - but probably only due to the fact I enjoyed late nights and contemplations more while high.

What I concluded over my recovery journey so far:

- Surroundings are n1 thing stopping you from your goal
- ITS ABOUT DRIVE ITS ABOUT POWER..... just kidding, but to be fair you need some amount of will-power to keep your mission in mind and not give up at some point, even for a puff.
- It is worth it BUT it's still not going to solve all your problems you might be blaming on the kush.
- Even if you slip once, count it as Day 1; otherwise you'll just take it as excuse
- To be fair, aside from the expansive list of things I found as bad side-effects, none of them were the reason I stopped smoking, honestly I just wanted to be ME again. Authentic as one can be without outside influence.
 ( I still drink tho but it doesn't affect my life nearly as much since I don't feel the effects or aftereffects ALL of the time )
- I listened to some podcasts and videos before this period in order to mentally prepare myself, I would list them down below but at the point I was watching them I didn't know I would be writing this so they're kinda lost in my youtube history, but any material you watch on that topic will be helpful.
- If I had to go about it from the beggining - I would find it much easier if my best friend decided on the same thing at the time as I did, so try that to diminish outer influence. 
One last thing: You're not missing anything if avoiding substances, the life experience you can actually remember is worth more than one sesh.

I used to think I didn't have a problem because *""just a couple hits– that's all I need.""*

This meant I could make an eighth of weed (around $80 worth) last anywhere from 4-6 months, depending on the season.

I thought the low use and modest spend actually meant I was in the clear!

Yet deep down, I always knew something was up.

Because getting high everyday, whether it was two hits or twenty-two hits, was still getting high.

(And once I moved to a legal state? *Instant* temptation to spend and use more, especially once I got my hands on edibles.)

And while I'd tell myself that I used weed as a ""spiritual tool"" and to help with chronic pain I'd been living with, the reality is that my life wasn't actually getting ANY better!

**By my early 30's, my personal growth and my career had reached a standstill, and deep down, I knew it was finally time to start making some changes.**

It was November 2020 when I began loosening my grip on weed, and the major catalyst was when a 14-year old joked that I was a pothead. This was definitely NOT the influence I wanted to have on those around me, especially to young and impressionable kids.

I knew it was time to make a big change to my life.

**By Divine Intervention, a mentor who could support me through these changes came into my life.**

From there, I began doing emotional healing work (healing my inner children i.e. mother wound & father wound) while healing my physical body in tandem.

Any slight cravings I was experiencing disappeared practically overnight once I went plant-based and began detoxing my body.

I also began overhauling the external parts of my life: friends, family, marriage, career, location.

If it was toxic, dysfunctional, and detrimental to my health and wellbeing, I addressed it, allowing in only the things and people who were truly capable of supporting my growth.

**Becoming the absolute best version of myself became my #1 priority.**

And as I began clearing out both my physical body and my surroundings, this cultivated more trust and strength within myself.

I was able to gain new insights and make connections around things from my past that had led me to seeking weed as a coping mechanism in the first place.

The stronger I became physically and mentally, the more I could handle emotionally, and the deeper I could go into my healing so that I’d never again want to turn to another vice again.

I’m not only one-year sober from weed, but alcohol, too. And I don’t feel like I gave up a thing. Only gained.

**Because I learned that all along, it wasn't weed that I needed.**

**It was ME.**

**And I got her back.**

Whelp I certainly never thought I'd be here when I started smoking back in highschool. Started off as a fun thing to do with my friends and by the sophomore year of college it was a full blown addiction. 

I got in trouble with my university for smoking. I can't remember most of college. My mental health started to decline severely. I entered a deep depressive episode my junior year and dropped out. I was barely eating except when I was high so I figured it was a form of self-medicating. 

I managed to pull it together and go back to school. I graduated, just barely scraping through, but I did it. And of course I rewarded myself all the while by getting high every night after class. ""at least I don't go to work or class high,"" I'd tell myself, like that made it somehow acceptable to smoke my mind into mush. 

After college I had no clue what to do. I didn't have any skills and I wasn't very interested in developing any. I worked odd jobs, never lasting long at them before I'd quit. Then came covid and I was smoking all day everyday. I was in a relationship where it was fun to smoke together. But in time I felt my mental health slipping, I started getting anxious around my gf when we'd smoke. 

I suffered a total mental health breakdown. Resulted in a break up and having to move home with my parents. I was humiliated and felt so isolated. I was still smoking everyday though. It's legal in my home state so I was smoking at home. I'd still feel guilty being around my parents high even though I'm fucking 25 years old. 

I had never been so low in my life, I felt like it had to be some mental illness besides depression. I started taking prescription medication for my mental health for the first time. I got analyzed by a neuropsychiatrist and learned I had OCD. All these years I had thought everyone dealt with intrusive and obsessive thoughts, with trying to force yourself not to think about a subject, a phrase, a person and your brain refusing to cooperate. I had sought weed to escape the anxiety of my own thought patterns but in time it only made it worse. 

I started to cut back after I ran out one day, going days without smoking for the first time in years. I bought more and even managed to stay sober for some days despite having it in my home. But I'd always find an excuse to smoke a little, or with my friends. The anxiety was not abiding, in fact smoking made it worse. Made me more introspective and turned inward. 

I decided, after a lot of wishy-washying, that something had to change. Today is the day I flushed down the last of my weed. I cleaned my pipe and grinder so I didn't even have crumbs left. I'm tired of being a stoner. I'm tired of being depressed and being a drain on the people around me. I'm tired of being a dark presence. I've lived like this so long i thought I'd never come out of it. But I feel so hopeful today.

It took enormous discipline at first, but after a while it was just a minor itch that I could resist scratching, even with a stoner girlfriend. That was a massive, massive success -- I had lost 2015 to the day I finally quit in a haze of weed. The fact that resisting eventually became easy was previously unthinkable.

I'm so glad I quit. It enabled me to make several necessary changes, survive several unexpected changes, and I was generally happier and healthier without it.

After a long time, I started to see that perhaps I could come back to it again. Obviously I was distrustful of my intentions and thought about it for a long time. I sat on the thought for about 6 months, examining it from every angle before moving forward.

I tried smoking again in October, 2021. It was really nice, somewhat underwhelming, and the most beautiful thing was: I didn't care. I felt like Tom Bombadil, picking up the ring and giving it back, feeling zero influence from it. It was clear that I had mastered my relationship to it. I was in control. I could either go back to not smoking with zero issue, or I could smoke on my terms.

Since then, I've smoked a few times socially. It was great each time, purely an addition, exactly what I liked weed about the first place. I've felt zero need to buy and keep it at my house. Weed now enters the same category of alcohol and sweets: I simply don't keep them in the house, and don't have them on weekdays. They are weekend-only, social-only substances. Moderation with these simple rules is effortless.

As we all know, pure abstinence is the easier, simpler approach than finding a grey area. It certainly was for me for a long time -- better to simply abstain 100% rather than try and adhere to a set of rules. For this reason I'm sure that this post will be a bit controversial, some will think that I'm deluding myself, but I just wanted to give a glimpse of what it's like on the other side to those who might be struggling.

Back story:

I smoked daily for 19 years and ended up consuming 3.5-7g of cali weed a day whilst racking up £80-£150 ($109-204) a day purely for the cali packs.

After smoking my body weight in weed around April 2020 and thereafter, I decided enough was enough and managed to quit for 110 days (having never stopped, ever, before that by choice).

See some previous posts if you’re interested in more on my past. 


First time quitting:

So around Xmas 2020 I posted up here all chuffed I had made it to 110 days and thinking okay I’ve got this. I can have some smokes with friends over Xmas and then put it aside. 

Spoiler alert, I may have managed to quit for 2x 30 day periods after that but then it crept back in until I was smoking daily again and hiding that fact from my SO because she wasn’t into it.


2022 quitting:

Well I haven’t touched a smoke all of 2022 so far and I am really keen to put my mind to good use. Have quit my job and intend to make good freelance money with a fresher head. Have been doing 2-3 marathons of walk/runs  a week all year. 


Wish me luck leavers. Hopefully you’ll see a lot more of me here and I’ll manage to stay strong and stick it out.

Here's my list of reasons and benefits.,"After 2 years smoking everyday before sleep, I've managed to quit. I honestly knew that I would make it, because I was so tired of that life... At the beggining it was amazing, you know how it is. But in the end was just non-sense. It made me an empty person, living just to get home and get high, forgetting what was really important for me. I'd be waking in the morning in a hazy, crawling to work, working in a fogginess, apathetic, not being able to concentrate nor remember things, and in general, life was being skipped.   
I think that's what was like.   


The benefits, so far, has been:  
\-Amazing, vividness dreams everynight (a new adventure everynight, my dream book is full. LOL)  
\-Better at socializing (I'm a very introverted person, and I've noticed some surprising changes so far. I can express myself better, with more coerency and clarity)  
\-Waking up SO MUCH easier and refreshed. (Used to wake in a haze and only feel ""awake"" after midday)  
\-I am aprecciating a lot more what I eat! (I don't know you guys, but with weed, I would eat everything, just to fill that ""void"" in the stomach, and with this I wouldn't even pay attention to the taste.  
\-Although my brain fog didn't fully got better yet, I know it's a matter of time (reading your guys posts helped me, because I always thought the fog should be gone in a week or so. But some people here say they only notice improvments after MONTHS!) \~And I will be paciently waiting.   
\-My memory is getting better! (I just COULDN'T remember the day before.)  
\-I've realized that I've made a great choice in giving up of weed, and that made me more happy/in peace with myself. (Makes sense?)  
\-I have WAY MORE time to do the things that I wanna do. Like reading, studying, gardening, gaming (And not just watching movies that I wouldn't even remember the day after)

Do have on/off headaches, but I might have covid, didn’t have this initially. Also have random cravings, along with consistent cravings at night. What works for me is remembering how the weekends used to be - I was a nightly smoker during the week, but would wake up excited on Saturday mornings for that first hit. Nothing like that wake and bake, the high would last a few hours and then I’d be back for some more. The next high wouldn’t last as long, and by the evenings I would need it every hour. By the time the day had passed I would have probably smoked 6-8 times. With some clarity now, I can understand that if something is rewarding and fun, you wouldn’t need more and more of it to feel good. If I could smoke once a day, and really not have an urge to keep doing it, I wouldn’t stop. That would be fine. But on those days, it’s never enough and never even as good as the first morning session.  I guess it just helps me to write it out that moderation is not an option with this stuff (and a lot of stuff). If we could moderate, we would.

Once you set your mentality on truly being better and growth, it gets easier from there knowing that in your future, you can see yourself in a better place compared to where you was at, just smoking.

How are all us colorful leaves doing today?  Any of the New Years resolution team checking in today? Questions? Comments? Celebration dances?!? 

Todays tip:

Healthy sources of dopamine are critical in the early stages of the quit.  The battle against boredom can be difficult. Find something easygoing to do like coloring, sketching, whittling, cleaning a room, organizing, guitar, long walk, photography, creative writing, etc. Creating or accomplishing something releases dopamine in a healthy way. Little wins help build contentment.

I switched to carts about 6 months ago, before that I was hitting my bong 10+ times a day. I felt good about switching to carts. Less paraphernalia for my kids to see. 

A few months ago I took yoga teacher training. Got really deep into meditating and yoga, and I realized how fake smoking weed made me feel. I would tell people to relax in their bodies but I couldn't relax mine unless I was high. 

So the thoughts started to really swirl. If not now, when? I told myself. 

So here I am. Yesterday was my first day completely clean, the two days before that I only smoked at night and (gasp!!) I didn't even really LIKE IT!! 

I'm making this post for accountability. Quitting feels easy right now, but I know it won't always.

A pretty normal habit for me at the time.  Little did I know my life was about to change.  5mg, so a small one, but I was always a light weight with edibles.  2 hours went by, I didn't feel anything, so I popped another.

We were pulling out of Harrisburg when it hit.  And I started freaking out.  I'd been smoking daily for years at that point, and I was used to the occasional anxiety I'd get from weed, but usually I could talk myself out of it.  Not this time.  I thought I was dying, my heart was beating like crazy, I couldn't catch my breath, I was scared to tell anyone since I still had more weed on me and I'd heard they will kick you off Amtrak if you have weed, like literally drop you at the next crossing.  There was a stranger seated next to me, giving me odd glances, he could probably see my entire body shaking with panic.  My gf at the time wouldn't pick up her phone, she was also stoned and not paying attention to the world.

I closed my eyes, listened to the Conan podcast for something distracting and funny, and tried to slow my breathing.  We were beside a freight train going the same direction as us.  The squealing noises from that train were infuriating.  I was fully convinced I'd died and I was in hell.  This is hell.  These sounds.  This feeling.  Trapped.  This is hell.  This is what hell is like.  

I opened my eyes and it had become dark out, night had fallen.  I was in a metal tube with 100 strangers, sterile fluorescent lighting, nothing to do but sit and wait til I got back to Pittsburgh.  This is hell.  I closed my eyes again, the anxiety welled back up.  Ok, keeping my eyes open helps.  A conductor came down the isle.  Shit, need to pretend I'm asleep or else she'll know.  Closed my eyes, a shot of panic welled up, the squealing beside me louder than ever.

This went on for an hour and a half.

Finally, I felt myself turn a corner.  I felt the anxiety chilling out.  It was another few hours to Pittsburgh, and the anxiety came and went in bouts, but I was generally able to convince it back down.

I never took edibles again after that.  A month or so later, I quit smoking.  It wasn't even that hard for me, I was just that done with it.  A month after that, I broke up with my girlfriend after realizing how incompatible we were.

I had panic attacks when I was younger, but not for a really long time.  I was 27 when the train panic attack happened, and my last panic attack before that was when I was like 19/20.

It was horrifying, but it was such a powerful impetus to change my life in this really wonderful way, I'm actually not that upset by it.  I'm...dare I say, glad it happened.

I’m writing this to let you know that literally anything is possible if you put your mind to it. 

I had it bad. I was such a mess and weed was the problem. My whole life I was known as a pothead and it destroyed my pride and confidence. I lived with people that smoked weed and had incredible lives(smart, gorgeous women, and high paying jobs, many friends, etc.) where I had none of that. I was made fun of and reminded of this everyday living with them.

I branched away. Got my own space. Had to think about what I wanted and what I can do. Quitting after almost a decade of use was extremely difficult. I needed at least one month to get my mind straight. I was literally going crazy, having extreme mood swings, and couldn’t think at all. Was broke and had nothing.

I was applying for jobs and saw this one company looking to hire a project manager and went for it. They told me to wait for 2 weeks after not getting back to me. They hired me and found out they chose me over this guy they were gonna hire but failed the drug test twice for weed. I took my drug test after a month and a half clean and passed knowingly. 

I now have my own office and learning to manage this office and about to fly up for training at the company headquarters. I work in specialty graphics and marketing and truly love this field. I have an incredibly talented girlfriend that I see and is very successful. 

You can do this. Don’t succumb to the pressure of weed. Literally get away from it, even if it means burning bridges with friends, deleting dealers numbers, shit, get away from a state that recreational if that’s what it takes. Be dedicated. You can do this. I did and it was guaranteed a million times worth it.

I have smoked weed pretty heavily (every day, as soon as I am home or awake) since I was 19, so 14 years. I did a lot of therapy over the last year and a half because as well as the pandemic I also had a bunch of personal realisations, some shitty things happen and I wanted to start to deal with them thinking it would help with my depression & anxiety. It did help quite a lot, and over the last 18 months I have quit twice for about 4 months each time. I was having some big cravings and bought some in December and have been smoking every day since. I finally met the absolute man of my dreams 6 months ago, and I have so many things I want us to be able to do and enjoy together, as well as I've just started going to the gym a few times a week. I guess what I am really struggling with is that I still live alone when my partner isn't here, I work from home and am pretty burnt out, quite another 4 weeks before I can go on a break. I don't go out because I don't want to get covid because we can't afford to have anyone on else on our team sick. Because of the combination of the isolation of 2 years of lockdowns (I live in Melbourne, Aus) and changing lifestyle and priorities I don't have many friends. Without weed I feel restless and agitated and bored, but there's not much to do. I quit because I wanted to do more but that's still not really happening. What can you guys suggest for things that helped you get through the boredom and restlessness and insomnia. I've never slept well without smoking but I sleep so much better and wake up naturally earlier if I'm smoking.

Started smoking when I was at university (21-27), was great when it started, remember where I had my first one, remember how great it felt with my mates, and for the first couple of years, thats how it stuck, was a friday night thing, after basketball, we wouldn't go out partying, we would go home, grab a pizza and a 10z and that would sort us for the whole night! the dream, £20 for a 14 inch pizza, bottle of cherry coke and some weed. This was great, this was how it should of remainded, was always told weed isn't addictive, to which I agree still and remain blaming the nicotine I mix it with for the reason I crave it, yet I use the excuse ""I don't smoke cigerettes, but I can't just smoke weed because it would be too expensive"" - one of many BS excuses I have made for smoking.

Age 24-25

Will try make these paragraphs breif, so apologise for whoever reading it. Friends left univesity and I chose to stay on and do my masters, such a effin grafter back in the day, I managed to get onto a completely different masters course from my undergraduate, simply because I convinced the lecturers that I would be willing and capable of completing it, regardless of the change of education (Music to Sport Science (remember, I was basketball and in the UK if you are like me and my friends, we love the game more than our ablilities give us credit for, so Sport science was already a common topic for me as I was always trying to increase my vertical jump)) but basketball was different, my friends had moved on, I still had the younger lot but they weren't my lot that I would end the session and head home with, Friday's felt weird, i attempted to go out to the clubs with the team, was great but the hangover not so much (was around 24+ at this point, only just learning that hangovers don't care about your plans for the next day) so this is where it began, I always associated buying from dealers here in England as shady and quite dodgy, so never did it myself, till I did. He was sound, he played ball, he was just another guy, so I had it on tap, started as 10z, but I won't bore you all with how that went, if you're this far in, you already know.

So it's not that bad for now, I still kept it to weekly, but it would be friday to sunday now, never became daily, but then I met a girl who didn't like it so I stopped, genuinely didn't think I'd touch it again.

Age 26-27

Fast forward to summer of 2018, she cheated on me, caught in my own home after I had been rushed to hospital due to a food poisoning issue a week earlier, but managed to get out a day early as I was given the option of a sedation/non-sedation colonoscopy (to make a pretty shitty story somewhat humerous) DO NOT HAVE A COLONOSCOPY WITHOUT SEDATION! But silver lining in it is I caught her, I was besotted, planned my life and had no idea of the cheating, so would of continued like nothing if I hadn't caught her. But this is when it began bad for me, no longer was it a weekend thing, once I got a good plug's number, it was daily, hourly almost (feels that way nowadays). a bad habit for me (especially financially) I couldn't just leave a bag with one in, I had to finish it, a habit I still can't crack to this day. Will cut this section short as this is way too long already.

27-28

Moved to Manchester, had no plug, didn't want one, I'd decided this was my fresh start, I had finally cracked it, well thought I had, until me and my uni friends all met back up, we played ball then wanted to smoke like we used to and I thought nothing of it because one thing we always said was ""weed isn't addictive"" till I joined this sub. Also learnt how easy it was to get a plug.

It wasn't until 2020 ish that I realised I cannot just have one with the boys, I have to carry on, we went to Amsterdam in 2020 and I'd said this would be my last big smoke and it was, because Covid sent us into lockdown so I had litterally not stress or reason to want to smoke, so I didn't again I found myself falling in and out spells of smoking, I'd smoke heavily for 3 months, then I'd quit for 3, would be in a constant cycle, I don't know why I would keep falling back into the habit, I don't know what caused it. but fast forward to June ish of 2020, a few months after I went to Dam and a couple months into lockdown. My brother died, I didn't know how to handle it, my mother also has terminal cancer which sucks and may contribute to why I find myself falling back to the smoke. I couldn't cope so i didn't I began to smoke heavily again, daily, from morning till night, didn't care, started planning how I could make weed a sustatainable part of my life, budgetted it into my daily living till October 2020, tried giving quitting another try and was successful again for a few months.

29-present

No idea why I picked it back up again, but I did until july 16th when I met a girl, didn't lie about the weed, just wasn't completely honest with the quantity in which I smoked, shes amazing, still with her now, ended up quitting from july 2021-december 2021, loved her for giving me a reason to wanting to, but December sucks for me, It's hard for me to see my Mum struggle when I visit and I visit a lot more during December, so I used that sorrow as an excuse to smoke again, just thought why not, I won't tell her about it and just do it through the week when I don't see her, you all already know it didn't just last a short while, I'm still smoking now and don't have any reason other that I am addicted to it. She is trying to quit smoking nicotine herself, so I am using that excuse for why I ""can"" smoke. I knew it had got bad again, the amount I was smoking, even smoked on Christmas, something I have never done before. But it got bad because I was forced into a situation where I couldn't smoke from boxiing day to new years day as I was with her family, I thought it would be fine till I had heavy withdrawals, they love to eat so their dinners were huge and normally I would eat it all, but I could barely finish half a plate due to my lack of apetite, it was embarrassing, I tried forcing so much food into me I was almost sick, it was quite humiliating, hopefully my excuses covered up for it, but it was a huge slap in the face, then there was the sweats and the sleep depravity. But rather than me using this time away to actually quit and get the ball rolling into the new year 7 days sober, which would of been a great way to begin. I felt cheated, I felt like I didn't get to have my ""final smoke"" so here I am, 10 days into January, smoking through 5/6g a night after work, from morning to night I will find time to do it. But I can't keep going on this way both for my health and financially, I am literally burning a hole into my ever shrinking bank account, yet every day that I have gone to quit this year, I have made an excuse not to, I don't even really get high anymore again, yet I am still making the excuses.

I want to quit, I have finished my stash, couldn't bring myself to throw away, how pathetic, but yesterday was my last day, again. I, like many others on here are using their posts as accountability and even if no one find strength in this one, I want to be able to wake up tomorrow, no smoke and read this back ready to start my journey to sobriety.

so the premise of this post is to hear some of the excuses you have made to continue to smoke, no matter how small or silly, but that can be found above in the TL;DR bit",1,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 2}","{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.42963034}"

I'm on day 3 and I'm surprised at how unmotivated I am. Fortunately I'm not really noticing any other withdrawal symptoms, aside from a bit of irritability. I don't feel depressed; I'm still doing basic self-care and going about my days as usual. But I am *really* struggling to do *anything* at work now, and I'm getting bored with my hobbies very quickly instead of being entertained for hours like I used to.

The low motivation at work scares me a bit because I work from home and I have a lot of independence in my job, so if I don't get my shit together I could do basically nothing for a week or two before anyone notices. I don't want to be a lazy asshole and abuse the independence my job gives me; it's a pretty good job and they treat me well. But that seems to be the direction things are going right now... I tapered last week before completely stopping on Friday, and over the last three work days I've probably averaged \~1 hour or less of real work per day. 

I guess none of this should be too surprising since addiction screws up the brain's dopamine system, which is the basis of motivation and reward.

Today I got a notification on my phone telling me that I am now two years clean from the green. I just wanted to share my history with pot, why I decided to quit and what I've learned since quitting. Warning, this is a long read!

**Marijuana and Me**

I started smoking pot when I was about 17 years old. It seemed unavoidable to me at the time as I hung out with a lot of skater/ska/grunge kids who all were slowly becoming addicted to weed. I distinctly remember the smell of the school bus when my friends would get picked up. Eventually, I was offered a pathetically rolled joint and experienced the wonderful feeling of being high for the first time.

From that point on, I had a very turbulent relationship with weed. The first year or so was really fun, but then I started to get horrible anxiety attacks when I was stoned. They would last hours and would consist of me curled up in a ball with what felt like my heart exploding out of my chest as I juggled with the idea that I was either going to die or end up in the hospital.

This led to me having anxiety attacks off of weed which led to really bad general anxiety and depression. In my research to find out how this could have happened, I came across a forum post (this was in 2009), of a 40 something year old man who had been dealing with anxiety attacks his entire adult life because of marijuana and he didn't know what to do about it. This scared me straight and I basically willed myself over the next 4-5 years to slowly come to terms with anxiety and how to deal with it. 

I will say, now writing this, that I have to thank marijuana for teaching me this ability, even though it took many years of fear, during a pivotal stage in my life, to learn.

I stopped smoking from around 19-22 and was re-introduced to weed by my girlfriend at the time. I still had random anxiety attacks here and there but because I'd had so many at that point, it was fairly manageable. This eventually led to me never having anxiety attacks and here is where my addiction to weed truly kicked off.

**The Six Year Long Dream**

From 22-28 I smoked a lot of weed. It became a fun challenge of mine to constantly smoke more than I had smoked before. I was reaching levels of weed smoking that would probably make Snoop himself toss me a fist bump. I was smoking and ingesting weed in every possible way that it could be done.

I surrounded myself with people that I could smoke with all night long. I can't deny the fun that we had! Video games, music, movies, ordering food, etc. I would toke up with stoner chicks and have amazing sex. I'd get high before any family dinner. Heck, I'd get high before going out to do absolutely anything.

Being high became the absolute normal thing for me. It got to a point where I welcomed anxiety attacks and when I would have them I'd smoke more just to see how far I could take it. I remember hitting a ""moon rock"" so hard I basically lost motor function and turned into flubber on a couch while my soul was screaming at me to never do that again. I remember taking so much Rick Simpson Oil that I'd curl up into a ball and start trembling in my bed as if hypothermia was settling in on my body. 

At the tail end of this epic usage of marijuana, two things happened to me. One, I met a girl. Two, I started to realize that I was forgetting every day of my life and any ambitions I had were slowly being extinguished like a lonely little flame in the cold. 

I would watch films and then slowly recall that I'd already seen them. Sometimes I'd ask a friend if they've ever seen a movie and they'd go ""Yeah man, with you! In theaters!"". It got to a point where if I was high on a day, then it would be assumed that I'd forget that day ever happened. 

I'm an ambitious person, I always have been since I was a kid. During my entire 6 year run with marijuana, I basically just kept telling myself that I'll get to my dreams eventually. If anything, I just assumed that weed was going to give me incredible creative abilities, which it did not.

So about this girl, she was not a stoner, but boy did I try to get her into it. I'd always offer her a hit of my bowl or blunt but she would always deny and then deal with me while I got high and sat next to her doing or saying whatever. Eventually, the memory issues and the feelings of losing my ambitions came to a head. I told my girlfriend what I was feeling and she said that I had to stop smoking wed. She also said if I did smoke weed, I'd have to venmo her $100 every time I got high. I said deal and we shook on it.

**It's Not You It's Me**

So it's been two years and I have not smoked weed since I made the deal with my (now ex!) girlfriend. For some reason the venmo thing was what really worked for me!

Quitting was not too difficult. I just tossed my supply and my utensils and quit cold turkey. Honestly the hardest part was being with my friends. Thankfully they're a good group of guys and were supportive of my decision, but that didn't stop them from smoking in front of me all the time and offering me hits. I just remained steadfast and kept denying until they finally went, ""Wow, you're actually going through with this?""

I'm also here to report that, not much has changed in two years being clean. I'm still being lazy with my ambitions, but at least now I know that it wasn't the fault of marijuana, but my own battle with discipline. It also took about a year or so to get my memory to improve. It still isn't wonderful but it's much better than before. 

I know truly that I probably won't smoke again. After a while from being away from it, you do begin to realize that you never want to go back to the dark places that weed takes you and makes you feel comfortable being in. Every time I would get high, I'd just wish I was sober. So now, I really am grateful to be sober all the time and just pass through life the way it is, without any fog over it. Hopefully from here on out, I can slowly become more disciplined and pursue my dreams!

I hope this read wasn't too long. I didn't intend it for it to be this epic but it all just came pouring out. Honestly I would've written more...

I don't normally post to reddit but I would really love some input on this topic. 

So, since essentially thanksgiving I've been smoking everyday, multiple times a day. So multiple of hits off a cart everyday for 2 months. I recently ran out with no way to re-up. The first day I didn't have weed, I puked about 3 times and dry heaved about 8. The next day(yesterday) i puked one and dry heaved once. I found a cart that had barely aaannnything in it and took a small puff and felt better. Today, day three, i took another puff this morning and was able to eat one cup of jello. Im still a little nauseous but i haven't thrown up today yet.

Im also extremely restless, anxious, and sweaty/craving to be cold.

I'm not sure if its chs or just withdrawl, and I'm not sure if i should quit cold turkey or continue to take a small puff a day and ween off.

I feel like it's going to be really hard not to give in to temptation, but I hope I'm strong enough to resist. I don't have anything left at home, so if I want to smoke I'll have to buy everything again, which will allow me to step back from the situation if the urge strikes me once.

2022-01-10 18:36:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/s0y4vf/575_days/,575 days,"When I checked just now I realized its been 575 days since I quit. Not really tracking that number day by day anymore, but I still look it up from time to time. Smoked daily from \~15 until I was 40. Grew or had connections to growers most of that time so supply was super cheap and never a problem.

I've shared my timeline many times in the past and I'll do it again for the newcomers or anyone interested.

**1 to 2 weeks** This would tough. It took a few days before it got bad but it was not easy getting through these first couple of weeks. Couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, mood was very low. Took care of myself and looked forward to a new lifestyle.

**1 to 3 months** Things eased up after the first couple of weeks for sure but the first few months were still not fun. I got depressed and my anxiety was pretty high through this period. I had headaches often. My appetite came back though. Sleep was still sloppy, not possible to sleep through the whole night. I was in a routine of waking up half way through the night and toking to get me through the rest of the night and I was still waking up at that time. There were slight glimmers of hope though - I felt pretty good about myself and where I was headed. My mood, when not feeling down or overly anxious was slowly starting to improve.

**3 to 6 months** This is where the situation started to change. Things began to feel lighter sometimes, especially towards the end of this time frame. Weed cravings weren't as intense and sometimes I'd go for long periods without even thinking about it. Normal life and the new routines I was developing was starting to take hold.

**6 to 12 months** This is where things really got better. In this phase my sleep got back to almost 100%. My mood made a drastic change closer to the 12 months mark (albeit getting there gradually of course). I was really able to think clearly and my mood was generally a lot calmer. 

**12 months to now** Things are still continuing to get better. Its a lot of work and patience adapting to life after having used weed for so long. The addict mind still exists inside me and I know it can be awakened by even the smallest amount of weed. I've proved this to be true to myself many times in the past. It's easy to ignore that old part of me though. Every now and then I'll wish I had the freedom to get high (or more accurately - my favourite beer+weed) but this is a freedom I had to leave behind when I choose to live the sober life. Is it unfair, yeah I guess it is a little unfair but I've had to make peace with it. I've spent my new found clarity and control of self to work on trying to be a better person and to achieve some of the things weed was holding me back from.

Am I new and different person? No. Did my life change radically by stopping weed alone? No. It was significant non-the-less, however. Emotionally I've never been so free as I am now, the thoughts in my mind are very peaceful now. When I was using weed the thing affected the most / worst were my emotions.

Spending time here on /r/leaves and sorting by new. Reading and participating helps a lot. Addiction is a selfish existence. Starting the practice of helping others can help restore balance. This is one of the biggest differences between these and all my previous unsupported quit attempts over the years. Helping others with similar issues is a great way to stay on track by keeping the big picture at the front of my mind. Look into the subject of service and addiction recovery.

That's fine & has woken me up that things need to change in my life.

I was smoking $1,600 every month with my gf of wax cartridges.","As the title says I was smoking a little too heavy with the gf... we found ourselves smoking 24/7. Wake up mid sleep? Take 2 huge hits of the pen. Hungry? Take a few hits. Want to watch a movie? Take a few hits. And this all eventually became a thing where our bodies would wake up to smoke. I was smoking $50 - $60 carts and sometimes me and the gf would finish a gram cart in 24 hours. This all spiraled out of control after becoming severely disabled in the Army.

I came home and became a chimney which was never me before. I was such an active kid. Competing teen bodybuilding, boyscouts, fire service and even college classes in high-school. Now I am just a guy that is barely alive to just smoke all the pain and worries away. At one point of this cycle I no longer cared for my health I got so comfortable with symptoms and loading myself with huge amounts of THC to essentially knock myself out to feel nothing.

I quit 3 days ago with my gf when facebook has a serious ""On this day"" post from 16 year old me saying all of the things I aspired to do prior. I spent the whole night trying to find my old self in my newer posts etc. Truth is I'm a whole different person on this stuff. And as for withdrawal it is pretty severe considering how much wax me and the gf would smoke. I was essentially smoking 30 grams of wax a month @ 90% THC. (Coldfire)

Withdrawal symptoms:
- Rapid heart rate when walking short distance or talking a lot.
- Night sweats (I wake up in a puddle not just a little sweat)
- Can not eat solid foods or I throw up. (Soups only work so far)
- Anxiety (never was an anxious person before)
- Mood swings (seems to go hand in hand with fluctuating energy levels)
- Mid-day hot/cold flashes
- inability to focus or retain info in classes or work
- Very very heavy feeling when breathing during running exercise/ coughing up lots of stuff already.
- my hands shake so much I can barely type sometimes. 

I do not crave the stuff currently and have nothing in the house. But the withdrawal symptoms seem to be dominant here. I think this will finally push me to sobriety and get my life back on track. I just wish I could reset everything and saved that money I used. But at the end of the day I take this as one of the most expensive lessons I needed to learn. I'm trying new hobbies and desperately trying to workout to speed this process. Wish me luck as I try to reconnect with the VA and get my health back on track and address the crippling anxiety this rare disease had given me.

I hope you all stay the course because as we all know this weed today is much much more different than the stuff our parents smoked which is why a lot of older people do not believe this is possible. Stay strong and God bless you all. I'll continue to draw inspiration from this subreddit.

But then I wouldn't remember everything that I had ""worked out"" while high and all the ""work"" was for not. 

I miss escaping and forgetting. Every sober day is like a punch in the face. A lifetime of depression, anger, resentment, that has never been worked through.

Now I'm smoking every day. I wake up feeling slightly high. It's become a massive problem for me, my finances and I'm just not being the parent I want to be because I'm always away with the fairies.

As of today I am 3 weeks and 1 day sober from weed (+alcohol, yay!!) In general thing have definitely gotten better for me after the first week of intense withdrawals- i vomited on days 2-3 and pretty much slept through those days, but my insomnia has lessened, normal appetite is slowly returning. i’m finally remembering what the feeling of actual hunger is, not just munchies lol. Above all else, i’m truly enjoying hanging with my friends and family for the first time in almost 3 years completely sober. It’s relieving to find that I’m still myself without the za. 

The past couple days have been especially hard for me, as I have spent more time alone (pretty much everyone I know+love has covid) It’s not that i’m bored and looking to weed for something to do- I just hate how anxious and in my head I get by my-sober-self. All I do is spiral and overthink without weed to numb out these thoughts. Journaling has helped a bit, and finding small things to distract myself (Pokémon Go has been a recent fave lol), but can’t seem to truly escape the feeling. 

i really want to just pick up again, but I know that if I do, i’m just going to fall into the same cycle of getting high all day, every day- and that would be so extremely unfair to myself and all the work I’ve put in so far.

People are unreliable and I don't have enough love for myself to give to me, plenty to others without reciprocation.

Now I am feeling this void. Big time. And without that crutch I'm having to fill it organically with my own love. I don't know how I was never taught. 

I think we see other people as projections and aspects of us so I will interpret how others see me with my own scope of how I see myself.

I know I'm a great person deep down, I'm honest, generous, kind, funny and a big thinker. I always give to others what I couldn't get. But on the surface level I see people don't have the time for me, don't see that in me and im just someone to look over. I am not worth it.

I’ve always said I wanted to just get my smoking under control but after totally quitting a few months back only to relapse when life got hard has me realizing that I have a problem. Call it addiction, dependence, whatever you want but cannabis has been controlling my life for quite some time now. Nothing should have control over my life except me. And to be honest, I think my relationship with weed is so toxic that I’ll likely never be able to find a healthy relationship with it….and as hard as this is to say, that’s ok. 

I’ve been an all day every day smoker for the last 15+ years of my life and have had a few runs that I went without. My whole family smokes, mom and bro being all day every day-ers. Dad has is phases but also sees the problem it can create.

I’ve always thought I loved Mary Jane, but I am starting to realize that allowing her into my life kind of fucked me up. 
And tbh, that’s hard because I really want to love her.  

Anyways, I’m quitting. I’m here to say it and to hold myself accountable. 

I know the next few weeks, and likely the next few months are going to be hard but I know I am strong enough. I also know I can come here when I need support. I plan to try to keep myself occupied any time I feel a relapse coming on and I’m taking some vitamins to help with dopamine levels and upkeeping my body but any advice or recommendations are appreciated.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.53103274}"

today is day 25. i thought i’d be happier but i’m just feeling drained. 

the physical withdrawal was terrible. i quit weed and nicotine cold turkey after being a heavy user and i really underestimated how bad the withdrawals could be. the first two weeks of physical withdrawals were brutal: stomach cramps, night sweats, gastro issues, twitching/shivering, etc. at the same time, loss of appetite made me lose 15 pounds and i felt so weak. 

by the end of the second week, most of my physical symptoms went away but was almost immediately replaced by a massive surge of anxiety. i was scared because i’ve never ever had anxiety before and i legitimately felt like i was dying. muscles felt constantly tense, i was in a fight-or-flight mode at all times. 

it was getting better but the last few days or so has been even worse. the anxiety came back in full force but more so in a mental way than a physical way. (to elaborate, i’m not getting symptoms like tight chest or heart beating really fast anymore, instead it’s this constant feeling of impending doom and worry.)

i just don’t know how much i can take of feeling like this anymore, i know that recovery can have good and bad days at any time but it just feels hopeless. am i going to be fucked up for the rest of my life…? it certainly feels like it.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.908108}"

Now Im trying to quit again. I'm day 6. Im experiencing so much stress in my life. I have three little kids who have been isolating at home for the past several years due to the pandemic. We socialize when we can and try hard to have meaningful time with them at home. The lack of normalcy is affecting us all and leading to behavior problems with my twin toddlers.

Between Covid and parenting stress and feeling sad about the state of the world, Im questioning whether I should have quit right this moment. This time around I have incorporated daily exercise and have gone from zero activity to a month straight of riding my peloton, weight lifting, yoga and meditation daily.  
I'm on meds for anxiety and depression and have completely overhauled my diet eating healthy foods and cooking more.

I hate how impatient and mean I can get towards my kids when Im sober and they arent listening. I'm also short with my husband.

I hope you're well.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with crippling Anxiety/panic attacks following quitting weed?

I've never had anxiety in my life before, and have been a daily smoker of weed for 15 years. For me it was always habitual and to try and stave off boredom. I've been recently diagnosed with pleurisy, and that lead to me having my first ever panic attack whilst smoking weed. After that particular episode, I decided to go cold turkey on both the weed and tobacco.

I don't have any racing thoughts as such, it's more of a body thing as in I'm getting: heart palpations, tremors, feeling like my throat is closing up, extremely cold hands and feet, etc. These symptoms come on randomly, multiple times a day and I'm currently on day 11 of no weed.

I've been without weed before, such as when I go to another country for a couple of weeks and not once have I ever experienced these episodes. I've been to the er about 5 times this week relating to these symptoms, as well as pain caused from the pleurisy. Ecgs have been done in me, as well as blood t3sts, chest xrays, etc and I'm healthy from a physical point of view.

I'll be going to my local doctor tomorrow to discuss this anxiety, but would welcome inputs from those of you who have been through something similar.

Today I asked him to go to his place. I told him I want to be alone. The truth is I love him so much I could use a friend more than ever and someone by my side but it is not fair on him. It is not fair for him to be my punching bag. I cried for 3-4 hours tonight. I screamed. I broke down completely. My boyfriend was worried about me but I told him all is well. I have to deal with my shit somehow by myself. But I don’t know how. I’m not okay. 

I’m so lonely. I based all my friendships around smoking weed. All my friends smoke so currently I can’t be around them. I need new friends for sure. Apart from feeling lonely I feel broken. I used to be so happy and full of energy. I don’t know who I am anymore and I feel like I have to reinvent myself all over again. Start from nothing and build myself up. But I can’t when I’m such an emotional mess. I don’t know how to lift myself up and how to feel better. I have been sober for 7 days and each day is as bad as the day before. 

Has anyone felt or feels the same? I’ve been reading so many posts on this sub. A lot of people say they feel better after the first night or around day 4. Why do I feel so awful after a week of being sober? 

For the first time in my life I want to die. I just want the pain to stop. I’m exhausted from being sad. But I’m not going to kill myself because I love my family too much and I can’t hurt them like that. My boyfriend would be upset too and he is my best friend. But even if I don’t kill myself because of my current state I am still hurting the people around me because I’m so down and like I said no longer the person I used to be. I used to smile all the time and make people happy. Now I just bring negative energy to the table. I was not so sad and god damn awful when I smoked. The weed kept me going but at the same time it is the reason why I am in such a dark place.

Today is my mom’s 67th birthday. Last year, I was so high all day I nearly forgot. She was struggling with cancer. I was annoyed when I remembered, as it was one more thing to deal with that stood between me and sweet oblivion. This year, I am going to pick up the computer that she and my sister got me for Christmas for my online tutoring job, my NA meetings, and my first graduate writing class which starts on January 24th. I got her flowers to make her smile. This year, I am THIRTY DAYS CLEAN!!!!! YES, I DID IT! I FINALLY DID SOMETHING EXTREMELY HARD THAT I SET OUT TO DO. 30 days ago, I was just fucking done. I was so sick of smoking weed all day, every day, unable to stop myself from waiting until my fiance was home to smoke.

30 days ago, I chose life. I chose my potential. I chose all my broken dreams that, I realized, aren’t broken at all, just gathering dust, waiting for me to come pick them back up. I was so ashamed for so many years that I convinced myself I didn’t even want those dreams anymore. I told myself that my dreams had changed, and gotten smaller, as I grew older and more realistic. I was lying to myself. My dreams are growing strong again, fueling my days and nights, forming my daily routines that will, eventually, lead to success and even bigger dreams.

30 days ago, I was scared, tired, and unsure. I had no idea what lay down this road, but I knew what lay down the road of smoking and using. And, I was so tired of being disappointed in myself. I was so tired of doing the bare minimum with my days, waiting until I could smoke again. I was so tired of pretending I was having FUN, when really, my soul was crying out. I saw the window to “get this” closing. I wondered if I would ever stop smoking. I wondered if I had simply gone too far down that road to turn around now.

Well, I turned around. I saw no other way. Either go on as best I could to the bitter ends - jails, institutions, and death - or find a new way to live. It’s good over here. It’s really good. And I know I’m JUST getting started. I’m so proud of myself. I’m so grateful to Narcotics Anonymous, the leaves lounge, the leaves subreddit, my sponsor, and my loving and supportive fiance.

I’m doing it. AND IT FEELS GOOD. I don’t want to forget this amazing feeling of pride and joy. I will remember this when things get hard. I love these milestones. I love this feeling of pride. I'm coming for that 60-day milestone next! Thank you r/leaves.",39,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47197583}"

I’m honestly really successful at my job, I also bought a house and everything- but the brain fog from smoking is killing me, and I can’t handle it anymore! I used to feel really sharp 100% of the time when I wasn’t getting high at night. I’m also training for a Marathon, and I’m sure smoking doesn’t help.

I’ve decided to try and stop smoking, but It’s the anxiety and insomnia at night that makes me want to smoke.

So here’s to day 1 again. Really hoping the withdraws won’t be too bad. Any positive stories about brain fog going away is greatly appreciated! Also has anyone used eye masks to sleep?

if i want that feeling i must break the cycle, and focus on creating that peace. with my own two hands. not waiting for it to reappear magically in some twist of the universe.

 Make a list of things that have improved since I quit. Once I started to see real improvement a couple weeks in, write those things out and keep it handy. The positives on that list will be stuck in my mind if I ever relapse. This list of how much better/easier life is without weed will be very effective in ruining the high. If I want to get high again, I have to give up this list. There are a lot of positives once I got going, so it's a lot to give up. Keep adding to the list along the way as you notice new positives.

I was 15 when I took my first hit and I smoked with friends on the weekends every once in a while but I would literally fantasize about the day I could come back to my own home and just take a bong rip sitting in my own living room. THAT seemed like the perfect life to me.  Once I turned 18, I got my medical Marijuana license and smoking became a daily thing. My tolerance just kept going up and up. At this point, I was quite the functional stoner and I would sometimes be high at work and always be high before literelly anything else. I loved cannabis and it helped me feel better as I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. It was my ""medicine"". I advocated for it whenever I could. I wanted to go into the cannabis industry. It was a passion of sorts. But the passion turned into indifference. At 24 cannabis was losing its magic for me. It was becoming more of a chore. I used to enjoy not only the high but the whole process. Now that process was a hassle. But I was still using it. Eating 500mg edibles in one sitting and taking dab after dab after dab. It no longer got me stoned. It just got me by. It was just a new normal. A normal that needed to be sustained for seemingly no reason. At 25 I decided I wanted to really cut back and maybe even stop. I tapered my use in concentrates until I was finally able to actually get high again. But it still wasn't even that fun now. I wondered if I even could stop. I had been lurking this page ever since. Two weeks ago I decided it was time. But right as I ran out I said ""okay just one more"" and bought another gram of concentrate. Two dabs in and I couldn't wait until it was gone. I got so high before work it wasn't even cool and I hated it but I did it again the next day and the next day ""just to get rid of the concentrate"" and that's when it clicked. ""Why the hell am I doing this!?"" I was out of concentrate right then and I knew I didn't wanna buy again. Yesterday was my first full day sober. I thought I had done that before. As I had gone days without supply before. But I always always would smoke at least a small dab of reclaim or something. So yesterday was my first true day not smoking a single thing.

The app I installed says I almost saved €25 and am halfway the acute phase of withdrawal. After this phase comes the psycho phase, which sounds kinda funny if you ask me. Nevertheless I look forward to that phase because I deal much better with psychological pain and discomfort than I do with physical discomfort.

I'm 27, Been smoking 12 years, 10 years daily - super potent weed and a helluva lot of it.. 

Now i'm on day 9 (made this my only new years resolution, or should i say new life resolution). Cravings are ok, i have more of a craving for tobacco which i also quit.

Just wanted to get some reassurance that the fatigue/lack of motivation/intense boredom will go away.. My night sleep is ok, the dreams are of course heavy stuff but i start to sleep through again. But after lunch i get so fatigued, i can't and don't want to do anything.. I usually do a lot of electronic music but i can't keep myself at it for like more than 5 minutes because i'm so fatigued and also not really motivated.. The weekend now is the worse because i just wait and wait until i can go back to bed again.

This is all fine with me, as long as i know it'll go away and i'll have more energy and endurance in the long run.. I feel like i'm going in and out of clarity/brain fog, as well as fatigue.. That's normal and will go away right?

2022-01-09 07:04:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rzqaak/is_this_common/,Is this common?,"I was a moderate user for the past 8ish years. Daily for periods of that but never was an all day every day person.   
  
For the last 5 years my mental health has been terrible, and I always decide that it's stupid for me to seek any other mental health improvement if I'm constantly indulging in something that is known to be detrimental to your mental health. The thing is, I always quit for a few weeks to months, and my mental health seems to stay the same or get worse, and I end up going straight back to it, essentially deciding that weed is not the issue and is in fact a fairly effective self medication.  
  
This time round I stopped using daily around 4 months ago. I stopped buying any altogether at the start of November. Unfortunately I've ended up smoking a handful of times since then with a friend and my brother, both of whom smoke very regularly. I buckled easily to temptation, but it's only been about 5 times or something in the last few months. The whole time I've been sober has been absolutely miserable, and it shows no signs of improving. I seem to be completely unable to enjoy anything, like I have 0 dopamine, and have noticed I spend almost every second of every day negatively judging myself. I basically think ""I hate myself"" and often ""I should kill myself"" maybe 100 times a day. The only things that give me any relief from these are involved activities, like chores or some video games, which can sometimes distract me for 15 minutes at a time. It's not particularly enjoyable and it's exhausting to try to keep myself busy for every waking moment. The lack of dopamine has lead to me drinking more heavily, and I suddenly started smoking cigarettes again despite having quit over a year ago.  
  
Meanwhile I don't think anything in my life has improved. For example, I'm pretty sure I'm just as lazy. When i would get high, i would at least often enjoy myself here and there, and also tend to feel great the next morning. The only real downside (other than money) was having much lower lows, where my depression would be amplified and more emotional. I think my sleep is better quality now, but it's not a remarkable difference and i still kinda sleep like shit. That said, if this is what it's going to be like for me, it was worth it just to feel _something_. I haven't yet had a single day where I've felt like quitting has done anything good for me.   
  
I'm mainly wondering if these things I've mentioned above (mainly the self hate and lack of enjoyment) are common symptoms of quitting. I know that a couple of months ultimately isn't a lot, especially when I've still smoked weed a few times, so I still haven't put in serious effort into this. If people can assure me that these are symptoms of quitting that will get better, then i will endeavour to make a greater effort and totally cut it out for a few months before i reevaluate again, but for now I'm leaning far more towards the idea that this is an unrelated mental health issue that I was self medicating for.  
  
I'm not saying I need to go back, but I think I probably need to focus my efforts on treating these issues, and i sort of feel like I'm just torturing myself unecessarily by going without with nothing to deal with these other symptoms. I am especially skeptical because it seems like a lot of people on here were _much_ heavier users than me (I rarely consumed more than about 5 grams a week and probably have averaged like 2 grams a week or less over the last 5 years) but seem to be able to find joy in other things almost immediately. I also haven't had any issues with common withdrawal symptoms like night sweats or anything like that. I know I'm looking at this very negatively though (probably sound like a miserable bastard) and I'm probably overestimating. Hopefully people can convince me.

My friends now have real jobs, earning shitloads of money. They're buying new apartments and cars. they're getting married and having kids all while i just sit at home and smoking blunts. I did take an education but it is in a field which is driven by competition and commitment as well as being able to spend a lot of time with people you don't know. - Not a very weed-friendly job. 

A couple of months ago, i found out that my mom has untreatable cancer. According to doctors, it is “a matter of years“ but i just can stand the thought of being in this world without my mom. Especially not if the last couple of years with her is with a cloudy brain. 

My depression has been growing for the last couple months. I've been having some fallouts with some other family members and are not talking to them anymore. I've also isolated myself from my friends. I have a wonderful girlfriend who's trying to be supportive but her dad i also sick with cancer and might die in a few weeks. I feel bad for feeling like shit because of my mom, when she's been giving years and my gf's dad only have a small amount of time left.

For some reason i just woke up the other day feeling ready to quit. I've realized that weed will only make me more depressed. I'm done creating memories and the let them go up in smoke. I'm done not doing my best because of a foggy brain and I'm done letting weed control how i plan my days just so i can get high. 

It's been a couple of days and I honestly don't miss it as much as i feared i would. I really feel ready to put that shit behind me and start living my life.

Over the past few months, my GF went into full-blown psychosis. She went to the hospital, and the doctors were convinced it was cannabis induced. Was extremely disturbing to see. They kept her in the hospital for two weeks, and for the entirety of her time there she was straight puking; docs diagnosed it as cannabis Hyperemesis. 

This was an incredibly eye opening experience for me, as I’ve always thought of weed as somewhat harmless. I mean, sure, makes you lazy, but psychosis? Couldn’t believe it. I decided to finally put it down. I had no clue that was gonna be my last joint, or last bag. I was waking up in the middle of the nights shaking and sweating for a week. I’m only 23, and have been smoking since I was about 13-14; almost 10 years. 

As I sobered up, I realized how much I’ve been missing out on. My hobby was literally to smoke. I had spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on weed. 

Just here to tell you guys, it’s possible. I was so deep in the bag, and I managed to get out. You can too. Think of your future. Heck, think of the savings you could be making if you cut down. 


My only fear: being passed a J and not being able to resist. I’ve avoided people I’ve smoked with/around, and that alone has helped tremendously. I would like to think I’m over the hard part, and now it’s time for the easier part.

I feel a lot less desire to smoke than I used to. So much of it is psychological for me. I can travel out of state to a non-friendly cannabis region for a week and basically forget about smoking, but as soon as I head back the thought of smoking again returns.
After EMDR, I can sense less of an emotional or psychological attachment to the idea of getting high. The desire is still there, but there’s something different. A knowing that feels more icky or slippery when I think about smoking. A remembering of who I was before I started smoking daily and cannabis became such a major character in my life for so many years.

I’ve posted quite a bit lately but it’s because I need the support more than ever right now. I posted two days ago that I was on a day 1 again after my last two relapses. I caved and continued my latest relapse bender of 8 days that very night so I feel like a fraud for posting that. And then again the last two nights as well. It’s like I was possessed, I threw all my passion for quitting out the window on a whim. Yesterday I was reading horrifying stories about young people who committed suicide or had their lives ruined because of their weed use, to strengthen my own resolve in quitting. I was reading this sub a lot yesterday as well. And yet there I was again at the end of the day delaying my day 1 start thinking “well I’ll just move my quitting date out 1 more day, already screwed up the last two days” Ahhhhh. It’s like all of my efforts are no match for the strength of my addiction. I’m so fed up. So frustrated. I have to quit for my future, my cognition, mental health, my lungs, my relationships(I’ve ruined many due to my use). I’ve been trying to quit for years now and since my last sober streak of 2 months until late December, I really thought I had it beat. And here I am now, stuck in a relapse and can barely even go 24hours without it when just a few weeks ago, I wasn’t even thinking about weed at all. This addiction is so mind boggling to me. Screw weed!!! I pray that last night was my last smoke. Any advice for people like me who have made it a few months sober but can’t seem to make it stick for good would be appreciated..

More background on why I’m being so dramatic for context: My longest sobriety stint was 6.5 months and that was two years ago…Oh and here is the real kicker that I haven’t gotten vulnerable about yet on this sub: the biggest reason I have to quit is my mental health. I’ve literally had weed trigger psychotic episodes in the past and lost jobs/relationships and have entered into horrible depressions in the aftermath of that. Literally the most devastating experiences of my life. If I don’t quit, I’ve been told by a psychiatrist that weed definitely can cause those episodes to come back and become worse. But the sky is the limit on my recovery if I never touch weed again as the best my mental health got was during the tail end of that 6.5 month stretch two years ago. So yeah, if I don’t quit my brain could literally be destroyed by a mental episode and my life ruined. And knowing all this, I’m still playing with fire. I even thought while high last night how incredibly irresponsible it is for me  to still be relapsing when I viscerally know how dangerous it is for me. Thanks for reading all this and sorry for long length but I feel like my back is against the wall and despite the enthusiasm of my last post two days ago to beat my addiction it feels like I’m currently losing this fight.

Oddly enough, the knowledge that I had weed readily available actually incentivized me to not use; it made it even more of a personal feat to resist knowing I could dip into my stash at any time. A control thing, I guess? I’m not sure how to feel. I’m  devastated at the loss of trust in my partner. And now knowing that my ability to not smoke right now is not due to free will but instead due to lack of accessibility at this moment in time is infuriating. Does that make any sense?

I started smoking in 2007 when I was 17

I have a medical card and before I quit, I was dabbing daily like a mad man

Idk what happened but I just can’t imagine being high again. 

Before I quit, 
I just remember taking big dabs and not enjoying the high at all.
I’d just get a lot of anxiety and want to do nothing. 

I remember my dealer buddy gave me a huge dab and I couldn’t feel my face.
There was a lag in every time I tried to move. I started pacing and I couldn’t even speak. 

I remember thinking I just want this horrible feeling to end.

Now that I’m sober I can’t even imagine getting high again and enjoying it.

I just remember being blasted away from reality.

Every time I smell it on the street, It smells gross.

I used to enjoy weed, but now every time I even think about weed- I get anxious.

My earlier weed years were pretty scary, but over the past few months I’ve only been smoking at night, typically right before bed. Part of my hesitancy to quit is that I don’t feel like marijuana has negatively impacted my life, I’m holding down a stable job (I’m a systems engineer), have hobbies and friends, exercise regularly, and have a healthy diet, plus of course my love for weed. But at the same time I also feel that I have been smoking so consistently for so long that maybe I just can’t notice the effects marijuana has had on me mentally and psychologically. I wanted to ask this community for advice, is it ok that I smoke every night before bed, or is that just my subconscious making excuses for me to not quit because I love getting high so much? I know I have an addiction, and merely having this addiction makes me a little uncomfortable sometimes, but for the most part it hasn’t even been close to being one of my worst addictions (nicotine and video games).

- Going cold turkey. By having an absolute separation from the drug, it helped me internalise and understanding the depth of my addiction. If you're trying to make excuses to have pot in your life, you're looking for an escape of your reality instead of altering the reality around you. ""Only with friends"" and ""just a small puff"" are ways of avoiding the depressing pressure of life, and this is a symptom pot alleviates but does not solve.

My ex and I both struggled with a psychological dependence on weed, and though our relationship was wonderful and very special to me, it also lead to me escalating my usage over time, and us encouraging each others bad habits. 

I continued to smoke A LOT after we broke up. I considered myself to be “over it” after the first month. I felt that I’d moved on sufficiently, and we stayed in contact with each other, texting and following each other on social media. During these months (and during our relationship) I was high whenever I had free time. Every evening and night, many afternoons, all day on the weekends. I thought I was enjoying myself. It was summer! And then, I was stressed from school and deserved a break! Also during this time, I was very depressed, and thought about my ex a lot. I worried about him, worried what he was thinking of me, and I felt terrible about my smoking habit though I continued to do it anyways. 

Well, I recently took a few weeks off from smoking because of external factors, and I had two very powerful dreams about him. It was as if my subconscious was bursting with messages that I had been ignoring and suppressing for months. In my dreams, he came to me and told me everything I’d always wanted to hear, he validated me, said he missed me, confirmed all my hopes and apologized to me for his wrongs. And it didn’t matter. In the dream, I knew upon hearing his words that what I truly needed had to come from inside me. Even if he gave me all the validation in the world it wouldn’t make me happy, and it was time for me to let go.

When I woke up I realized a few things: I realized that I was not over it, that I had been using weed to avoid dealing with these difficult emotions, that staying in contact with him had made it impossible to move on, and that it was up to me to let go and move forward. 

This dream led me to finally do some things I should’ve done a while ago. It gave me some really important insight into myself. And it made me realize how weed had been dulling my self reflection, distracting me from the vital work of trying to understand myself. I will not smoke today, so that I may dream tonight.

I have tried quitting a few times, but my insomnia without pot is insane. I was ready for it this time though, no excuses since I had an alternative this time. Signed up for therapy, mentality coach, psychiatrist. I’ve even slipped with THIS much support before but I believe it was because of a lack of community— weed made me isolate and I became an introvert somehow. I want to post here to attempt some of that community building now. I plan on going to an in person meeting too. They have MA 420 meetings in my hood and lots of online ones too. I’m making a plan this time and I have managed to believe I can do it.

Things have gotten pretty bad for me. Been smoking daily for about 10 years. Past three years, heavy. About 3 grams a day. Past year, about 5 grams a day. It’s insane. My habit of hiding from myself took all my money. Between weed and grub hub orders, I’d spend more than a hundred dollars on that every day. It’s not money I should be spending but my self-compassion and self-care has been so unimportant to me and my depression so rampant, that I currently have $1000 to my name and just blew nearly all I was planning to pay grad school loans off with. I am ashamed and embarrassed. When high, I made excuses, binge ate, ignored things and people, got more depressed and victim mode-y, shopped online like crazy, let myself be completely reckless because I cared so little about me in my stupified and careless state. I never wanted to die, just not to really be present here or anywhere really. I know it’s just running away from facing my traumas and wallowing in them/trying to ignore them. I work from home and would just get high all day and take too long to finish things but because believe it or not I am still somehow responsible at work, I’d just work late and get it all done. So my days became awful. And long. And even though weed was the problem, it was also the ‘spice up your life’ solution I came up with. I’m actually quite intelligent and have a great job, yet even that became something I toyed with due to being so high all the time. Correction- not even high, just smoking to get to a high I could no longer have at my levels anyway. What was I running from? The process of even wondering made me want to smoke. Someone last week referred to a weed-crackhead mentality. That post made me feel less alone and less isolated in my state. I live alone and once passed out from smoking too much and found myself gaining conscience on my kitchen floor... scary. That was three years ago and I still didn’t stop. What’s it going to take? Day one is past me. I’m so glad I found this group. I will take it one day at a time. I will try to reach out to friends and family I’ve ignored for years. Feeling bad and having shame around that and what friends prob assume about me (they don’t know what I actually do when they think I just smoke pot- they don’t get the mania as I would never tell them all this.) So I’ve built up a lot of well-being walls for myself. I’m a 34 y/o female just wasting away and doing it to myself. It ended yesterday! I need to make some goals for 2022 to plan for filling the time that will now be free for me to use up however I want since I won’t be drugging anymore. When an unfamiliar amount of time is available to me, I kinda freak out. They’re all new thoughts and feelings now. I tell myself it takes three months to shift a pattern. We can do three months of suffering. Good luck to us all!

Don't be too hard on myself for losing patience and temper, but be mindful of it.  Try and catch the flare off before hurting friends and family.  Journaling about when these things happen and the surrounding circumstances can help find patterns and eventually lead to more control.  Being away from using gives me more clarity, self reflection is one way I can put that clarity to good use.

I wouldn't smoke every day and if I did it would only be at night. I stopped for months at a time multiple times. 

Around September of this year life got really hard for me, everything went to shit at once. I started working 60 hour weeks and every waking moment I wasn't at work I was high. This was my way of avoiding dealing with many of my issues. My smoking increased dramatically in a way I didn't think would be too hard to reverse. I was doing this for 3 months. Once I cut back my hours, I still wasn't doing things I loved and instead got high. I completely ignored my emotions. I relapsed on my porn addiction. I wasn't spending time with friends. I wasn't doing the things that made me happy before.

Well, I've made it a measly 2 days clean from weed and I did NOT realize how fucking awful weed withdrawal can be. I have terrible headaches, I feel like nothing matters and I hate everything, I can't sleep at ALL... I rarely drink but I got really drunk last night to cope and I was still miserable after getting drunk. This sucks. This really really sucks. I've never experienced this with weed before 

I hadn't thought about permanently quitting weed seriously before now. I don't want to put myself through this again. I completely lost control of my usage and I know I would absolutely love to do it again. I think it is the righ decision though. It will be hard considering most of my friends and my partner smoke a lot. Hopefully I can put this behind me...

I’d already posted here a couple times about my increasing fixation about weed and Christmas. The two things were just so closely intertwined. I’d smoked for 35 years and this would have been my first Christmas without weed. It was so hard to ignore the cravings, and then the day after Christmas I went and bought a ten buck bag. I felt a mix of elation and massive guilt as I made my way home with visions of a blissful few evenings eating crap, watching crap and getting high, like all those other Christmases. Jesus H Christ what a shock I was in for. After nearly a year clean, two puffs had me on the verge of a panic attack. It felt absolutely TERRIBLE. As I slowly calmed down, I just felt so bad in so many ways. There was nothing pleasurable whatsoever and all I wanted was to feel like myself again. I thought, why did I ever do this?? I threw the rest into the trash. For the next two days I felt completely out of sorts. Here I am nearly two weeks later feeling a lot wiser. In a way I’m glad it happened - it was ultimately a positive experience as it erased any lingering thoughts that I might want to smoke ever again. That said, I don’t recommend it.

I've not been a habitual user or smoker for many years, but have a repeating habit of using in response to stress or strong emotional events, this last year in dealing with my family as there's a history of trauma and abuse.

So, although I'm only day 6, I'm not going through the same kind of withdrawals as all of you are. I quit drinking 13 or 14 years ago and there's no question that the best things in my life have come from sobriety. When I'm sober, that fact tops my gratitude list nearly every day.

For a few years now, I've used my google calendar to track the habits I want to encourage. These include writing my ""morning pages"" (a journal), writing fiction (I just made my first pro-rate sale for a horror short story in November), meditating, yoga, walking / hiking. All those good things. I use a different color for each activity, and when I'm filling my life in this way, there's a beautiful rainbow across my calendar. The dopamine from doing these things is more subtle but so much more REAL than what we get from smoking. 

My calendar for most of December is blank. A gray slate with nothing on it. 

But for this past week, the rainbow has returned. I'm writing again, I've been folding some exercise back in, journaling, doing boring housework too although I don't put that on my calendar. 

Just sharing this. I'm really too old to keep playing around this. I'm 46F - and I don't wanna make anybody who is older feel bad - but... I don't have 3 weeks of productivity to just throw away anymore, plus the risk that I could get off track for months or years, because it happens. It's happened many times. Hoping to break this cycle.

Anyhow, you all are lovely and doing good work.

All my hobbies (photography, videography, graphic design) suddenly didn’t matter anymore. I became obsessed at this new hobby of mine, quickly smoking once a day less than a year into smoking. I became a master roller, mastered every blunt wrap from swishers to backwoods, mastered every size joint from 1 1/4 to my favorite king slims. I loved rolling so much I just kept rolling more and more, bigger and bigger, and would get more and more fried. I even started double rolling and sticking two wraps or papers together for fatter and longer blunts and joints. I quickly progressed through my stoner path way faster than my stoner peers who had been smoking for far more years. My tolerance became insane. I started looking for higher quality bud, buying massive amounts to support my rolling and weed addiction. 

I quit last week after only a year of smoking. Two days ago I rolled a mini joint that I convinced myself I needed. I ended up stashing it away hoping I’d forget about it. Today that joint is crushed and in the trash. Gone are all my papers. 

Instead of going outside with a 4-inch long joint or a half inch thick blunt, I go out with my DSLR, and see what my walk will let me see and capture the beauty of this world. Sobriety really is awesome, I have to fully get there first.

That being said, they also often have me missing it and wishing I could use “one last time”. I know that if I give in and lapse just once, a full relapse is very likely to happen. 

I have and still am putting up as many walls as I can to prevent myself from using again, such as disposing of my paraphernalia, coming clean with my SO and other loved ones (none of which knew I used at all, let alone abused), and seeing and being honest with a therapist who I trust.

I smoke and eat weed every night (and a few days per week). My partner doesn't know how much I use because I do it at night. 

It occurred to me a few days ago that I am depressed and don't feel like doing any of the things I am normally passionate about.

I'm starting to suspect that my daily use has created an false sense of accomplishment, of purpose.

I just had a daughter and am going to college to be a nurse, and what started as a little use has become a necessity of mundane TV watching, gaming, and consuming social media and food. I'm 30lbs overweight and I'm ready to make a change!

I thought weed was making me happy and less anxious, but now I realize it was likely causing me to feel pretty hopeless. I can’t believe that for nearly 10 years I was essentially worsening my depression/anxiety. Weed is pretty much a pro-depressant for me. This is the first time where I haven’t missed it in the initial days of quitting, I think because I see the truth now. 

The last few days I’ve already shown some growth. I decided to start looking for my first home to purchase. I accepted a social invite with new people, and really enjoyed it. I set new personal records at the gym. I’m so excited to see what else is in store for me with this new clarity.

I’m two weeks into quitting a 15 year daily addiction. I’ve always thought that my somewhat irritated/multiple bowel movements in the morning were due to coffee. 

When I quit, within two days, my BMs became incredibly “normal”- no longer liquid-y, and decreased from a handful of times a day (mostly concentrated to an hour or so after waking) to one solid boy in the morning, and maybe another healthy turd later on in the evening (but more often just the one in the AM!)!

I have not really read this side effect anywhere, but it absolutely must be related to cannabis. I’ve always exercised regularly and ate healthily. My caffeine intake is basically the same. I will note that my anxiety is less severe overall (not moment by moment but overall), which may be the cause- but I still attribute that to quitting.

Started out only smoking 2 or 3 times a week but by the time I turned 17 it was pretty much a daily habit until exactly 3 months ago. Today Ive hit 3 months without a single hit of THC and I wanna talk a bit about the changes I’ve experienced 

Physically I feel better. I’m able to eat more food and my digestion in general is a lot better even when I eat like crap. As a result I generally feel more energized. My lungs seem like they’ve cleared up a bit and I no longer suffer from shortness of breath. 

Mentally I feel more clear headed (still have moments of brain fog though) and Ive been able to make a lot of progress with depression and anxiety. Although I still feel it come on sometimes it’s much less intense and it passes much quicker. I also don’t immediately reach for weed, which prolongs and intensifies the cycle. Instead, I locate the root cause and either try to deal with it or go do something else. 

Spiritually is where I think I’ve made the most process. I recognized that I was an addict before I ever picked up weed. I had a hole in my soul that I tried to fill up with any form of instant gratification. Through meditation and other spiritual work, I’ve been able to find ways to be mindful and content in the present moment and recognize emotions as passing thoughts.

I experienced a lot of childhood neglect and abuse, and during the beginning of the pandemic I decided to get my medical card. I feel it has been a godsend. My triggers didn’t effect me as viscerally, I still maintained my job, social relationships, money was fine, I was fine. I went to therapy weekly, made strides there in my healing. I went back to college, decided on my long term goals. I created short stories and poems that were praised by my professor, and she told me that I could really make it, once I learn the business aspects. I have a direction, goals, and aspirations I’m working towards. Isn’t weed supposed to dull those things? 

Why would I ever decide to cut it out when I’m not experiencing any negative side effects? 

I’m reliant on it though. I found myself reaching for it during moments of boredom. Boredom is one of the harder emotions for me to feel. Boredom feels like a void in which my brain fills with prickly, negative, self-deprecating thoughts. THC filled that void with comfort and warmth instead. Don’t I deserve that? 

But, my relationship with weed is contentious. I’ve been inching myself towards taking a break (at least) for a while. My tolerance has skyrocketed with my daily flower-vaping usage. I’m experiencing diminishing returns. I was doing it just to do it, feel a little fuzzy, and not feel effected by the void in my brain. 

So I decided when I ran out I wouldn’t go back to the dispensary this time. I just so happened to hear back from a job that I’m interested in, and the timing lined up with when I ran out, so even more reason to give it up, at least for a while. 

I don’t like how I feel right now though, having been off it for a few days. My dreams are uncomfortably vivid and feature the people who hurt me the most. I’m anxious, a little dizzy, nauseous. Depression is hanging over me like a haze. Every bit of me would rather feel that comfort I felt while I was on it. The fact that I’m feeling withdrawal tells me that I was addicted, but it still feels like a question mark whether or not that is inherently a bad thing. 

I don’t know, my resolve is pretty thin, but I would like to see this through for a while. I know there are things I need to work out within myself without this crutch. The side effects of quitting are worse than being on it, though. Is there some sort of middle ground of moderation? I’m not sure. 

I would love to hear other’s experiences with quitting, especially if you have trauma. Was it worth it? What was the final straw? What has lead you to staying off of it?

Classes were cancelled and the library and gym are closed and tbh I dont even own a pair of snow boots.

The weekend can be a time to unwind for many.  It's especially been a big part of our high lives for years.  I bet many of you started using on weekend only.  It's easy to get carried away with the party and let down our guard.  Instead, double down on celebrating in a more healthy way.  Find healthy sources of dopamine that work for you.  

Don't be fooled by the ""It's just the weekend, I worked so hard, I can stop again on Monday."".  We already know by experience that we are not able to control our using like that.  

Stay strong!  Focus on those reasons that you quit in the first place.  We already know the weed life stopped working for us a long time ago.

I never wrote that down or said it aloud until this morning. I tried quitting multiple times in the past, but I always gave up within a few days. I started smoking 5 years ago, at first for fun, then to dull the pain of abuse, and then whenever I was bored. I gradually increased the amount until I no longer felt effects. I continued to smoke out of habit and avoid withdrawal symptoms. But this morning I decided to quit. To *try* instead of just saying I quit. The negatives of smoking weed outweigh the positives. I can't afford it, I put no money into savings, and I recently borrowed cash to buy weed. I told them exactly what I was going to use the money for, and I'll pay them back in a couple of weeks, but I still feel shame about it. I have a medical card, but the cost is still absurd. I'm damaging my lungs. I never thought of myself as a smoker because I don't smoke cigarettes, but I was lying to myself. I feel slow. My memory has always been poor, smoking makes it worse. I have a disability and constantly feel shame about where I am in life. I'm already 33, I don't want another 5 years to fly by with me not moving forward. 

I am in weekly therapy and working hard to get better. I hope that combining therapy with quitting weed will help me improve more quickly than if I continue therapy but keep smoking. There are very few good reasons to continue to feed my addiction, and many great reasons to get sober.

-been heavy user for over 20+ years (in mid 30's)

-5'10"", 160lbs

-multiple (like 8+) bowls/bongs daily



i thought things would be much worse. days 1-3 were bad. the chills, night sweats, no appetite, insomnia - the normal stuff you hear.

From there though days 4 - 8 were similar but not nearly as bad. Appetite returned, sleeping got easier, night sweats/chills subsided - things starting to level out.

Now though, I have cravings but they pass. I can feel myself being edgy/short fused but I can also control that (First step is identifying it). My appetite is fully back and I am sleeping throughout the night assuming my cat doesnt wake me up.


I know my experience may be a bit more streamlined than others - i would attribute that to becoming a bit of a gym rat, drinking like 72oz+ of water a day, and also sitting in the sauna after workouts and sweating liters out of me.


I was afraid I wouldn't like the same things I did while high - vidya, scifi shows, fictional books, anime...but that's not the case at all. Still enjoying it and to be honest, I pay better attention.


Surprisingly my anxiety has reduced also. I used to have all this anxiety around long car rides and my stomach and I'd smoke to compensate but now I don't even think about it.


my words of advice to people starting this journey are this: Make sure you understand your reasoning to quit. Make sure it is clear and in the front of your mind because you will be tested. Having that clear vision of why you are quitting though makes it easier to resist those cravings.


And for the love of god, pound as much water as you can and go to the gym. Do it just to work up a sweat. If you don't have a gym - go run 2 miles around your block. Doesn't matter how long it takes - push your body to exhaustion. You will get hungry again, you will sleep again, you will return to normal. But if you sit around on the couch doing nothing you will drive yourself crazy and most likely relapse.

My Story
I wanted to make this post as a good way to clear my head and put my thoughts into words. Apologies for the length, I just felt getting this all out would be good for me. 

I had so many problems with weed that I never truly saw until I stopped. Every time I would postpone an important phone call cause I was to high to talk on the phone. Every time I would take a hit before getting in the car, even though It was a bad idea. Every time I would smoke and get so high I couldn’t move or let alone operate the car I was driving and need to switch with the passenger or worse push through on my own. Every time I would waste my night on the couch instead of doing the list of things I need to get done. Fast forward to the last few months where this got worse by having an employer that allowed cannabis use on the clock. The only time I was sober was quickly becoming more and more high time. 

Well I have finally woken from my fucked up slumber. Thankfully this time when I noticed the demon on my shoulder there is a life in tact around me, rather than ashes. But just because I am enjoying my life, doesn’t mean I wouldn’t enjoy more if I made a change! Maybe I would pursue a new career even though I’m comfortable with my current line of work I know I could do more for the world. 

So today is day 5 and man does quitting this shit suck. This time I’m quitting a substance without compensating with another. I’m standing up with my own courage and man is that scary at times! The side effects suck. I’m constantly emotional and on the verge of tears. My stomach is in constant turmoil and I feel unmotivated and uncomfortable. But that’s okay. Sometimes in life you need to be uncomfortable to become a better person on the other side. Each day on this streak has gotten slightly better then the last. For the first time I feel like it will stick, that I will find no need to pick back up the bong. Excited for today and excited for tomorrow for the first item in a long time. 

I’m sharing my story so that hopefully someone can learn from my mistakes. Don’t let the demons consume you without your knowledge. If you are using anything daily make sure to take a step back and assess with taking it away would improve your life.",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43835655}"

Days 1-4 were fine except for the physical symptoms (diarrhea, cold sweats, lack of appetite, insomnia). Starting day 5, I noticed that I was waking up with severe anxiety and panic attacks throughout the day over smallest things. I didn’t have the urge to smoke, but I also was in this state of depression/numbness all the time. 

I picked up the weed habit during the pandemic and it got really bad during the social isolation months. Was smoking like 3-5 bowl/day (~ 1oz/2 weeks) from my bong and was drowning myself in THC… not to mention the weed I was smoking was usually exotics (35-38% THC). I decided to quit in July 2021 after a terrible breakup with a toxic partner and was living my best life during those months that I quit. Then, work got really stressful in November 2021, so I decided to take one toke and everything just unraveled. It was just one joint, I told myself… but then I started to go back to the old habit of smoking everyday. However this time, weed wasn’t giving me the same calm that it did before. Weed was having the opposite effect as it used to — it was numbing me and giving me social anxiety. I was such a positive person when I quit and now I feel like no one wants to be around me b/c I’m such a downer all the time. 

I’m determined to quit for good but the anxiety attacks are getting really bad. I literally curled up in a ball crying out of nowhere (over some unresolved feelings). I know it doesn’t help that I’m also in quarantine b/c the omicron variant is spreading like wildfire, but just need some reassurance that I’ll get out of it and it’ll be okay.

There have been festering issues across the board that culminated in depression, anxiety, isolation, you name it. I dove into excessive drug use to avoid having to confront this side of myself. Stopping weed is not waving a magic wand, it's the first step of many to holding yourself accountable and becoming the person you know you can be. Being steamrolled by clarity of how fucked up you are is part of the withdrawal process. There are obviously physical effects of quitting weed, but I think the root of it all is finally having a clear view of your true self at this stage and not having the means to deal with what you see and how you feel. Being forced to adapt and learn on the fly. This is hard. Often I feel adrift in a tempest, desperately clawing at anything to buoy me as I gasp for air. Is this means for panic? No. You are being tested, because you cast yourself out to sea when the habit became an addiction. There is one guarantee if you give up: drown.

My girlfriend and I have decided to quit smoking this year over a variety of reasons such as money, loss of free time, and just in general not feeling our normal selves amongst many, MANY other things. 

I have been a daily smoker for about 5/6 years and always found it difficult to kick the habit but my mindset this time around is different. I really want it. We stopped the first of the year and the withdrawals are hitting pretty hard. For my girlfriend her main issue has been lack of appetite and involuntary vomiting due to CHS (happens every time she quits which thankfully already stopped, she’s been smoking the better part of 2 years). 

For myself the side affects get a bit more intense. My appetite is diminished, it’s nearly impossible to sleep at night, profusely sweating all day and night and I am irritable to the point where I feel like I should just stay to myself and not associate with anybody cause everything bothers me, and I mean everything. Unfortunately this sometimes gets taken out on my lovely girlfriend which she does not deserve in the slightest but we have talked about it and she know it’s because of the withdrawals. 

I’m holding out strong this time but the irritability is more intense this time than any other time I have tried to quit. 

Does anybody have any advice on these aspect of the withdrawals? I’ve tried taking walks trying to reframe my thinking, etc. but nothing seems to work.

I hope you're all well.

I've decided to give up weed after smoking it almost on a daily basis for 15 years, ever since I was around 15 or so. This is in part due to me getting married in 6 months, and looking to start a family shortly after.

I've not experienced the typical withdrawal symptoms (irritability, insomnia, loss of appetite etc) however, I am experiencing my palms and feet being very sweaty and at time freezing cold to the touch. I woke up today shivering, and had blurred vision for a few hours. As I type now, I have a tingling/numbing feeling in my both legs. Recently, I've been diagnosed with pleurisy (which essentially forced me to quit, and I'm glad it did in a weird way) and have been to the ER, as I had all the symptoms of extremely low blood pressure. They did an ekg, chest xray, as well as a series of bloods, and they all came back normal. The Dr suggested it was the weed withdrawals, however I can't seem to find many people that have experienced the same.

It's a little bit frightening if I'm being honest, has anyone else experienced these types of withdrawals aftrt quitting weed?

I smoked every day for 20+ years, and since being in lockdown it turned into an all-day affair. I knew it was actually making me feel worse than I wanted to admit, but that is the thing about weed. It makes you think it’s fine because you can’t overdose and it’s not chemically addictive like alcohol or other drugs. So you do more and more because you think you can get away with it. I was able to stay productive and have a great job and perform well, so why not keep smoking? But I always had something in the back of my mind telling me that all these excuses to keep smoking was actually an addiction talking. 

I was curious to see what the other side was like because at worst I could go right back if I wanted to.

My withdrawal symptoms hit me right away, I've experienced insane insomnia, lack of appetite, sweating and my body temperature has been unregulated over the past few days. The cravings were really strong on the first and second day, third day was easier, today I did not crave at all. Instead, I had a profound realization: that I don't even like being high as much as I like suppressing my emotions. 

I was a daily smoker for 10 years, and have suffered from major depression and anxiety for the same amount of time. Weed used to be my medicine, but it soon became my suppressant when I started abusing it. I was suppressing all of my emotions, my sadness, my happiness, everything because at the time, I didn't know how to handle my heavy emotions. This, I believe, is the subconscious reason I abused weed and became addicted. I have never even allowed myself the chance to be happy. 

Over the last three years, I've done a lot of inner child and shadow work with therapists, nothing felt like it stuck. Now sober for four days and I feel renewed, I feel mentally clearer, I'm not anxious at all, and if I get any intrusive, depressive thoughts, I'm able to nurture myself and regulate my emotions in ways I haven't before. It's like all of my inner child and shadow work is finally coming through. I am grateful. This feeling is keeping me from wanting to get high again. My mental health is my most cherished possession, I truly feel like I have found something that will help me, and it isn't weed, it's the deep connection to oneself.

It caused tons of problems in my life.  I quit 8 years ago because back then I met a girl with two amazing kids.  They became my life for 8 years.  The girl and I broke up this summer and now I have a lot more time on my hands, especially with this pandemic.  So last week I decided to travel to a nearby state and buy some weed.  I smoked 5 days in a row after not smoking for 8 years and then just today threw it all out.  Here are some thoughts and observations about the last 5 days from a marijuana addict who quit for 8 years and then smoked daily for 5 days and then threw it all out to quit again:

1. It wasn’t worth it.  
2. It was hard to be happy and enjoy myself because the feeling of being high just brought back a lot of bad memories.
3. The only day I was happy was today.  I got high this morning and threw the rest of the weed out and felt really good about myself.  I wondered maybe the trick to be being happy after smoking weed is to buy weed and throw it out, that could get expensive though.
4. Every time I smoked and got high this week I told myself I had to throw this shit out because this feeling sucks.
5. My family found out because I smelled like weed one day and they got all upset.  Rightfully so.  I thought to myself, another reason to throw this shit out.  Don’t need to be bringing back bad memories and issues for them again or myself again.  As you all know, addiction doesn’t just affect the addict.
6. I noticed I was shittier at things I enjoyed like video games.  I also couldn’t get anything done that I had wanted to do such as say reading, work projects, studying, anything that required concentration.  My brain was in park.
7. Finally, I threw it out because in the end I had gotten all I had wanted out of smoking again.  I realized it made me feel like shit, was going to cause problems with others, would slow down progress towards my long term goals, and I just didn’t need to risk the temptation of getting hooked on it again.  I quit cigarettes and vaping after quitting weed 8 years ago and I’ve lost a little weight these last few months.  No need to welcome something back in that I’d already quit.
8. All in all, my original intent was to smoke once or twice and then keep a little stash for rainy days or every now and again.  It became evident that wasn’t going to be the case, just like in the past.  Just the fact that weed in my house made me want to smoke it.  I’d go workout and think on my way back man I deserve to smoke.  Or I’d wakeup and think about when would be a good time to smoke today.   Then I would smoke it and not enjoy myself at all.  How crazy is that?  Being tempted by something that you know will make you depressed and just feel shitty overall.

I don’t know guys and gals.  Weed kinda destroyed a large part of my life.  Going back to smoking after quitting for so long just made me feel worse about how much of my past I wasted.  I guess my reason for writing this is just to share my experience and some thoughts.  I wish r/leaves had existed 20 years ago, it would’ve really helped me out.  Back when I was quitting I felt kinda less than the other addicts because my problem was with weed.  Having this community is a great thing.  

Also, I remember when each hour of not smoking weed was an accomplishment.  Keep your heads up because it gets so much easier.  For me I found purpose in a relationship and getting started in a job/career.  Your purpose might not be the same as mine but finding something to occupy my time was key.  Before I new it I had quit for 4 years and laughed at how I could never imagine quitting for 4 hours much less 4 years.  

Looking forward, I don’t have any intention of smoking again, anytime soon.  I’m not setting a time period to not smoke like 8 years or forever.  I’m just going to take things one day at a time and fill my days with little goals and activities that help build towards some of the longer term goals I’ve set for myself.",42,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64927024}"

2022-01-06 16:30:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rxpinq/i_am_scared/,I Am Scared,"I took a break 2 years ago around December for about 3 month. This was rather for some tolerance break than qutting for good. My Ex-Girlfriend always kept me at a point where I was not able to smoke daily, which was thinking about it now, the better thing for her to do, even though it annoyed me and I wanted to smoke more than she was happy about.

Last year on March (pretty much a few days before the end of my break) we broke up for other reasons than weed. As I said, weed was not THAT big of an issue. At least that's what I thought at that time.

After the break-up I have been smoking daily probably around 0.5-1g of weed. Maybe more, maybe less and started doing some other drugs (acid and k) on a monthly to bi-monthly basis.

Around October I openly communicated to a friend of mine who also smokes daily, that I would prefer to cut it down. Maybe weekends only. Or at least decreasing it slowly until I am at the point where I will only smoke on weekends. And hopefully not every weekend.

The last few days I was googling about some withdrawal symptoms, even though I was already pretty much fond of what will happen, because I took some breaks before and I always knew weed can give you some nasty withdrawal symptoms.

Pretty much since my break-up with my ex-gf I have been in therapy for various reasons. I had quite some revelations and realisations this year, that fucked my mind A LOT. I am 29 and finally am getting closer to understanding myself as much as I have never understood myself before. Life from now on will be pretty troublesome and difficult for me, because I revealed stuff about myself, that I was never aware of before. I won't go into detail about it, because it is not of importance here.

I remember being on this subreddit yesterday or the day before that, probably because google sent me here while looking for some withdrawal symptoms, etc.

Today, about an hour ago, I received a push notification and I already can't remember what the thread exactly was about, probably someone quitting weed and his withdrawal symptoms he is going through. Edit: I looked it up, it was about someone sharing, that it is weird how much of a human you feel after quitting.

The thread got me hooked into this subreddit and lurking into a few more posts. And there was this post about people that thought they could try smoking again after a certain time. Thinking that they might have some power over it now, kicking them right back into another episode of smoking daily for weeks, months if not years.

My plan was to cold turkey smoking weed. I did and I still am since last Sunday. I was planning to quit for a ""longer"" period. I didn't set a date in my mind, maybe 1, 2, 3, 6 month, who knows. And after that time, I wanted to go back smoking maybe on a weekend-basis.

Knowing what happened the last time, reading about other people not having the control over it, I came to the realisation I have to quit forever. And this scares me. A lot. It gets me all emotional. I wanted to hop on the discord to lurk and maybe chat a bit, but figured that it is only open for certain hours.

I went back to the thread on reddit and read a few more posts about people falling back into that vicious circle. I started crying out of fear of quitting for good when my brain realized that this seems to be the only option and I am crying again as soon as I started typing the paragraph before this one.

This whole year has been a burning hell for my mental health and life is slipping out of my hands. I quit smoking cigarettes 3 years ago, I quit drinking alcohol 2 1/2 years ago (I was not even close to being any kind of alcoholic, but I am a better human being without it) and now I am also supposed to quit weed? This shit is so fucking scary and I don't know if this will better other parts of my life. Because right now, I can't get out of bed for anything else but work. And it has been like this for the last 9 month.

Life has been and is shallow enough for me, even without weed. I am on that daily hunt for some serotonin, and I hope I won't substitute weed with anything else, because I can get easily addicted to a lot of stuff. E.g. unhealthy food, especially sugar. I am also trying to not drink coffee on a daily basis (I never did, but it became a bit of a habit to get a coffee in my lunch break almost every day for the last few weeks, I know, 1 coffee per day isn't that bad, but I don't want to fall into another addiction just to counter the ""loss"" of weed). I get addicted so fucking easily and nothing scares me as much as quitting weed. Hopefully writing this down will help me to really quit for good because I start believing that it is for the best. Thanks to anyone taking their time reading my little story up to this point.

At least for me, I relapsed and was feeling super anxious, paranoid and heartbeat through the roof. I was aware of my paranoid thoughts and realized how insane they were. I’d rather not be anxious or paranoid and have control over my thoughts. The problem I think occurs when after that first smoke, you smoke again soon after. That ups your tolerance and then starts to make being high your baseline or new normal. Thereafter every time you get high is to maintain that new normal and it isn’t as intense as when you relapsed. Also now your brain is chasing dopamine because it’s been depleted and the cycle continues. After relapsing I realized I don’t want those feelings and don’t want to smoke again constantly to feel normal highs. Threw out my stash right after and what do you know, wanted to go back and get it because my brain needed more dopamine after that huge influx and depletion.

Lessons learned,"I’ve literally lost count at how many quit attempts I’ve had, but I do know I’ve been trying to actively quit since 2016. It is now 2022. Sheesh. That realization today hit me hard. I had two of my strongest months at the end of 2021 and I thought that quit attempt I had won the victory over weed in my mind, but that addict side of me was still there waiting for an opportune time to strike. I relapsed for 4 days on 12/23 after those two months sober, quit again for a few days then relapsed for six days straight until my higher self had enough yesterday. Today I’m getting back on the path I know I must be on.

It was bizarre how quickly I decided to throw away all the mental work I had done to get sober prior and give in to this “fuck it” impulsive mentality. I literally was reading posts for hours trying to logically prevent another relapse before my last one but it’s like that primal emotional side of my brain completely hijacked me. In the end, these last two relapses weren’t enjoyable at all. I was literally returning to chase a high that doesn’t exist anymore. I just felt dull, ate a bunch of crappy food till my stomach hurt and woke up ashamed each day. It was astonishing how quickly my use went to full blown daily smoking multiple times per day, and it’s so hard for me to believe that i have now gone years with this being my normal. I felt low yesterday because it felt like this addiction just keeps on sneaking back in my life and I’m desperately wanting this quit attempt to be the one that sticks. 

But I did learn some powerful lessons about that primal emotional part of me that runs to weed. I came to accept that weed was just an ineffective coping mechanism I used to get through the pain/trauma in my life. It was an ill-advised attempt to love myself, but now that I know better I know that loving myself is getting rid of this destructive drug. This quit attempt I will succeed because I will seek out more effective coping methods to deal with my life pains and focus more on connection with others..As well as facing the tough aspects of my life that I was using weed to run from(bad career situation I want to turn around, debt, mental health, loneliness). I think in the end my last two relapses were triggered by me thinking that sobriety wasn’t as good as I had hoped and my problems weren’t improving as much as I had hoped. This time I want to be more proactive in my recovery and face those painful aspects of my life with more patience. Things aren’t going to be all sunshines and rainbows two to three months into sobriety…But it will be better than two to three months of succumbing to weed. I see that hurt part of myself now that yearns for the escape of weed in a whole new light, and not only as me self-sabotaging. I was simply trying to get my human needs met in a way that in the end caused me harm, and now I must love and care for myself enough in a fuller way so that I don’t ever equate self harm with self love again. These relapses are the final frontier of my addiction and I believe that this will be the quit attempt where I truly overcome.

I  was leaving for new city and planned to carry some weed oil to my new  place, however as universe would have it, I would not get my stash in  time, even though I tried to get it till the very end. The timing was  interesting as me and friend had dropped some tabs before I was moving  out, and he brought up the fact that I was abusing weed and not moving  forward with things in life. In a trip, things feel universy  and spiritual, I had considered that I would leave, but still couldnt  bring myself to it.

And as per the  plan life had for me, I ended up being sober for the first time in 6  years. Before I regularly started smoking up, I had motivations and  aspirations in life, fast forward a few years, I have no job, got dumped  by a loving person because I was too lazy to make productive changes in  my life and in the worst mental state of my life, all this while, I was  continuously dependent on weed for numbing my mental health issues and  convincing myself it was only a harmless plant.

Now  coming to the part where how my life is after I quit (or was forced  to), its pretty much the same, I still am not productive, still have  bouts of depression, anxiety but I am just not smoking up.

In the grand scheme of things, this day seems random to choose to post but it’s the first day I felt I had something to offer someone going through this difficult period. And no matter what anyone may tell you, it IS difficult.

I smoked weed for the better part of the last 7 years (age 24) and never saw it as a problem. I functioned, or thought I did anyway, above par in comparison to those who chose drinking as their vice or to the sober Sally’s (not derogatory, just a little alliteration for humor) of the world. 

I worked in an industry where drug testing was never required and thus, never felt compelled to stop even for a tolerance break. I just smoked more. My friendships, relationships, and desired interactions were solely based on it. It didn’t happen overnight, but I woke up 22 days ago realizing it had dictated the better part of my consciousness for the last several years. Not maliciously of course, just as a result of the culture and atmosphere it inspired. I knew I wanted to stop.

Like some of you, I had tried taking breaks before but always came back within a matter of days because I missed the escape; or felt FOMO from being around my friends who were partaking. I could never truly see myself stopping. The question that always came to me was - Who cares, it’s just weed?

Unfortunately, as I’ve had time to truly reflect, it did impact me. My mental health was in a crater in comparison to my younger self. Even with the obvious struggles of early adulthood, I knew the self-isolation, periods of depression, and unstable sense of motivation, were as a result of prolonged usage. Once again, not overnight, but I had lost myself after craving that escape too much. The escape from stress, anxiety, and responsibility.

The only thing that has helped me over the last three weeks is focusing on why I wanted to stop and why I wanted to be better. For me, it was three things.
1. Enjoy my sober self and enjoy sober interactions.
2. At 24, I should be grinding to achieve my professional goals. Weed may not have fully stopped me from achieving them, but I knew they would cause an undesired delay.
3. To prove that I don’t need ANY substance to live my day-to-day life. This is the most motivating one for me personally as I’ve always had an addictive personality with things like caffeine and nicotine.

Weed allowed me to become a fully functional morning person and it was amazing. 

But then I started doing it too much. Over the past seven years it went from bedtime to after dinner to whenever I was upset, stressed, or depressed, to all the time, wake and bake. 

Last year I started this thing where I’d let my stash run out and see if I could go without it. NOPE. Worst sleep ever. I did all nighters half the time I tried it and felt terrible the next day even if I COULD sleep. My wife encouraged me to get more, so I could function. But she didn’t know how much I was actually doing. I was mad that she kept enabling me but I wasn’t gonna stop her…

Finally I told her I was smoking way too much and needed help. Since I needed it for sleep we thought just doing it less would be okay. 

Then in October I let my stash run out and for some unknown reason I was able to sleep just fine. I didn’t get it. I’d heard that it takes three weeks to break a habit, so after three weeks I got more weed. It was awesome the first couple of days but within a week I was back to my old habit. The funny thing was weed wasn’t as good as I’d remembered it. I felt more enslaved by it than freed by it. 

I tried going off two more times but couldn’t sleep. 

Then on December 10 I ran out again, and I could sleep. Taking the opportunity, I forgot about trying to reduce it and decided just to quit altogether. As long as I can sleep fine, I don’t need it at all.

TLDR; 23 years old, relapsed,1000mg thc + a day eveyday for five months. Need help on quitting and what I should expect the following weeks. Currently nauseous af and insomnia. 


Some context I have had issues in the past with weed and other drugs. Safe to say I’m kinda an addict when it comes to feeling good/weird. That’s why I fell in love with weed. It soothes you in a way not even ur mother holding you could. With any love however, you get lost and that was what happened to me.  Once a week turned into twice a week turned into I could do it after work too turned into I could just do it everyday anytime of day.  When it got to that point I was at a really low point in my life and the weed honestly just help me not think ( I have a tendency to spiral in thoughts about my fucked up life XD). However during this time I quit my job, isolated from my friends, and honestly was just high everyday. I developed a eating disorder of some sort? Basically I was constantly nauseous then when I did weed. Poof 4000 calories down the drain no issues. I believe since I was so high all the time when I was sober I became very anxious and anxiety ridden. That my heart would race and make me nauceous? Idk if that’s true just my hypothesis. At first I was fine with that cause I was a big gym rat so calorie surplus equals bigger numbers right? Unfortunately, no. When I was high I could eat but that was the extent of my capabilities. I couldn’t workout high nor could I eat sober, so I  would just down a protein shake and go workout as I couldn’t eat solid foods sober or else I would be nauseous. FUNNY as it is, even drinks shakes WATER was fucking me up. I remember vividly just throwing up my protein shake in the gym parking lot after failing 405 on deadlifts which I’ve hit for an AMRAP of 10 before. And just proceeded to sit in my car questioning my life choices. This was what lead me to quit. The one thing in my life I find therapeutic was the gym. The moment I saw my numbers decline as delusional of a reason to quit, was my reason. I no longer felt this catch 22 that there’s no answer to my problem that I was fucked either way. Don’t do weed and I’ll feel like shit, do do weed and welp overtime it’ll make you feel like shit too but you just don’t know it. That lead me to quit abruptly ( this was 3 months of daily usage at dosages of like 50mg-100mg edibles, 200 if I was wildin that night). Might not seem like much for some but shit hit fat for me ngl. Fast forward, four months clean. Physical health was peaking however my mental health was still shit. And honestly all it took was one good day for me to go, hey maybe it’s worth trying again with moderation! I was feeding myself ideas of how maybe it wasn’t edibles. It was smoking from the pen, “artificial synthetic weed”. That messed me up or that I was allergic to the protein shakes...Anyways lol.... Fast forward, that was not the case. I was not in a good enough space nor was moderation considered. ( what to expect from a junkie🤪). From September to January I have relapsed quite hard and got to the point where I was doing 1000mg thc edibles everyday sometimes more along with smoking grass( no more synthetic pens :p). It’s got to the point where I can’t function without it ( not to say I’m even functional on it). I’d wake up and take edibles( my main source of calories believe it or not) I gave myself until 2022 to stop and janaury 2 was my last day taking any. Three days in cold turkey and so far severly nauseous( just cant swallow food without wanting to throw up) and I cannot sleep ( two hours over three days) and also down 10 pounds :,). Wanted to just ween off slowly but also think I won’t feel lower doses now and will just end up relapsing if not cold turkey. If anyone has any tips or advice on what to expect/do I would appreciate. I’ve never done this much nor have been as dependent on it as these last couple months and really want to quit, but it’s not proving to be the easiest.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4510218}"

The gym here is closed due to covid lockdown and I don't exercise well outdoors in winter time due to asthma. So I will have to figure out how to get more exercise to speed detox up even more. I took a picture of myself each day up untill now and I can see change in my skin and my eyes already. What really helps me now is drinking 2 liters of water a day, the app that lets me know how far I am in detox and shows me what I've regained in health and money. And last but definitely not least r/leaves is a life line, knowing I am not struggling alone gives me more power than the sweaty monster. I really look forward to having more energy and concentration so I can be a better social worker and get my degree up.

I am so proud of myself. I am such a different person to who I was a year ago, and one of the biggest contributing factors in my growth was quitting weed. Quitting weed is growth itself, and it also makes it easier to grow in other aspects of life. 

In this time I have saved around £1800 from not smoking! 

I will definitely be celebrating this milestone with a few close friends. I plan on going out for dinner and just enjoying a nice sober evening 😁

Thank you to everyone here, for sharing journeys, giving up time out of your days to help others through advice or experience, and for being so supportive of each other.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions on my journey, are seeking advice, or just want to chat! If I can use my own experience and downfalls to help someone else on their mission to quit weed then that is an amazing thing.

Much love ❤️",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.98289764}"

A small win on an otherwise shitty day 4. I don’t feel too bad, but also like total shit. Other parts of my life were very challenging today. I know it’s probably just a coincidence I remembered, but also I didn’t smoke on the way to the store like I always used to so I’m sure that was it.

As life went on and times got tough, I would turn to weed to getaway. I have trust issues with friends so I don't really have anyone I can talk to when I'm sad, mad, depressed, lonely, etc... weed is my coping mechanism. I'm 3 days sober, and I don't have the urge yet. 
Luckily I found someone I can trust, and I'm in a relationship with them, but we’re still getting to know each other, and when we fight, I can't help but smoke behind their back to help with my emotions. To feel better with whatever pain I'm going through. My partner wants to help me quit, and I'm grateful for that. But our fights sometimes make it impossible for me to stop entirely. 
I'm also running into another issue. I'm a furniture/interior designer. I actually become wayyy more creative when I'm high and I tested it out before. I drew a design sober which came out okay, but when I drew a design high... It was breathtaking. I really think outside the box, but I don't want to rely on getting high to be a great designer. I want to use it only if I get “writer’s block”. If I'm stuck on a design, THEN ill smoke. But I abuse this idea and think I need to be high all day even if I'm not designing something new. It's a dumb excuse and I can't control myself.",6,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46440914}"

I started my journey the 3. of january last year after a difficult trip. I cant tell if i was just so dissapointed in myself or just too scared to ever touch weed again.
The first month was almost no sleeping, vivid dreams, lots of anxiety, thought loops and dp/dr. I did however never have any cravings. Appetite was good and after awhile sleep got better too

I worked out during the whole process and found that it really helped. By summer depersonalization was pretty much gone and i slept 7-8 hours a night. There was a lot of parties during the summer and i found after drinking i could experience heightened anxiety the following week or two

By now i only have some minor anxiety a few days after nights out drinking and experience a little winter-depression here and there.
And thats totally normal for a human being i think!

And on that bombshell i have written enough!

Weeks 1-3:  Definitely the hardest times.  Physical symptoms (lack of appetite, sleep,  increased irritability, cravings) were all the worst here by far.   

Months 1-3: Physical symptoms werent as intense but still present.  Brain fog here was the worst,  felt like I was living in a dream and not really in a good way.  Hard to find interest/motivation to do things.  

Months 3-6: Things felt 'OK' for the first time in a while.  Still generally depressed or hard to be interested in stuff.  Sleep and appetite normal,  irritability gone.  Overall mood feels more 'stable' even if flat.  

Months 6-9:  Interest in things returning.  Able to do things used to enjoy for fun (movies, video games, reading) fully again, sober.  Attention span feels increased,  along with memory finally starting to kick back up.  

For context,  im 28 and was a daily smoker since I was 19.  This is the first time I've been this sober since then.  Its honestly crazy and getting crazier all the time,  in the beginning of sobriety it didnt really feel like it was worth it but now,  for the first time in a DECADE,  im actually starting to feel like myself again.  Like that core 'spark' of who I am and who I can be,  its coming back.  It makes me want to try hard and do good in this life,  instead of just slinking by, only trying to FEEL good.  

If you're wondering if going sober is worth it,  Im 9 months in and can say that for me it definitely has been.  I wasnt sure at the begining but now I can really feel it in my soul.  Its like an investment in something,  at first its not much but you keep living your life and eventually you look and see its grown to something huge that can change your life for the better.

Yet I know how much pain, turmoil, anxiety, and missed opportunities weed has caused me. I know I’m a much better person when I’m sober but for some reason I’ve just been missing it… especially since it’s been awhile the stoner in me can’t help but think “man my tolerance is gone it would SLAP to take an edible” but like I said weed brings me more pain than anything I know that getting high “just once” will lead to more and will reset my progress. I’m not far enough along in my sobriety to give moderation a try considering I have taken a 30 day break once before and my childhood dog died on the last day of said break and I smoked to cope and quickly returned right back to my old habits. It’s hard because I can’t help but fantasize about a future where I might be able to smoke in moderation because it feels like I’m too “young” to give up weed for the rest of my life. Especially when it feels like I’m giving up fun social opportunities since I don’t enjoy drinking as much. But yet I know I can’t keep doing it until I’m a lot further along in my goals. I’m 20 and I wanted to start a cannabis business when I turned 21 but now that I quit after hitting rock bottom I feel a bit lost in my goals and sobriety hasn’t opened my eyes as much as I thought it would. But I know I’m better now than I was 45 days ago. Just not as “better” as I thought I would be if that makes sense. I thought I would’ve improved a lot more in my hobbies, losing weight, and other goals. So I guess that’s why it’s become even more tempting to get high “just once.” And I justify it by thinking I used to smoke, I’ll just do edibles instead lol. As if that makes it better. Anyways I have been craving it a lot the past few days and I’ve been going to marijuana anonymous meetings every week but unfortunately today’s meeting was cancelled due to covid… and I really needed it. None of my friends understand my issue with weed. I don’t want to go back but I can’t help but crave it so bad… it would be so easy to just go to the dispensary and feel higher than the sky… I miss the shit I used to do when I was high. It’s just not the same sober. But I know i will go on a bender since I’m not that far into sobriety and I can’t do that

For context: I’m 20, been smoking on a near daily basis for 5 years (especially in the past two, heavy since covid) with some breaks here and there but this is my longest break from weed EVER. Second longest was the 30 days I mentioned before. I took that break intentionally to “break the habit” and then smoke in moderation… yeah… that didn’t work out lol. But knowing that it didn’t work is what keeps me sober now.",7,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42434338}"

* I couldn't leave the house anymore because I was high all the time (I work from home)
* I had to be high within 5 minutes of waking up (before coffee)
* I would have to smoke a bowl every 2 hours, every day
* I would avoid my own wife and 4 kids because I was high
* I resented anyone and anything that prevented me from staying home and getting high
* I started to feel like life wasn't worth living after I got high (deepening depression)
* I couldn't feel anymore - joy or pain
* I lost my job because I couldn't bring myself to do anything productive
* I didn't want to eat anymore and was losing weight rapidly - weed replaced food
* I'd smoke kief at night until I was dizzy and felt sick - then do it again the next day
* **I completely lost control of my ability to stop doing it.**

I quit 1/1/22. I've quit many times before, but I've never realized so clearly that if I don't quit forever, my potential in life will be destroyed, as it has been the last 6 years (I'm 35 now). Everytime time I quit, I always relapse after the first time I get high. Everytime I relapse, I use more and get worse.

The withdrawals have been brutal, I'm so pissed all the time. I literally want to strangle everyone I see. I want to punch everything and just scream. I can't sleep. I sweat profusely at night. I feel like crying but I can't.

I got rid of everything. I don't want to smoke again. Even though this is so hard, I don't even have a desire to get high, even though I know it would bring me temporary relief. **I've fucked up my life enough and I'm fucking done.**

I'm so ready to change. I'm so tired of feeling so shitty and tired all the time. I feel like I've missed my kids growing up. I've been there for them, but not really. I want to be a better person. I want to have control over my own actions and my life. I want to connect with others and stop hiding within myself.

Most days are hard - been feeling down and have anxiety, but I know I’m slowly getting to a better place. Night sweats are rarer, and dreams are come and go. I’ve casually thought about what it would be like to smoke a couple times, but I’m not entertaining those thoughts and have zero intentions to ever go back.

I just decided to quit 5 days ago. I had tried many times but to be honest I think I didn't know why, just felt that anxiety that weed induces when you smoke it daily. I've been a daily night user for a year and a half, and smoked regularly (3 or 4 times a week) for a year before that. That makes 2.5 years of regular use.

This time I know why I want to quit, it steals me time, it makes me feel more tired even though I sleep my hours, it gives me that ""brain fog"" in the morning and to be honest for all the day, it puts me further of my goals and my desirable skills, it makes me passive, it gives me huge memory losses... I could keep for a lot of lines.

I was a night user and used it to ""relax"" but it was an excuse to go to relax very soon (9pm tbh is pretty soon for me) and I just watched tv shows, youtube videos and things on the internet and could remember less than half of them during the rest of my life, very different from how I was before that. This is not how I want to be. I want to be a goals seeking person, keep learning and trying new things and I've read that you can return to what you were before weed if you stop. Is this true? Will I recover my memory?

Apart from this, I need to ask. Is weed a total NO for me the rest of my life? When I started smoking it just really felt very different from what I was feeling the latter times. It boosted my creativity, it was pretty fun and I surely wouldn't smoke alone or at night. Is it impossible to use weed like once every 2 months with some friends to play music or try to write something or whatever? Would I become addicted again if I tried? If that's not the case, how much time would it be safe to not smoke until that moment? Maybe 6 months? Maybe years?

I've tried to quit a few times, and I will admit I'm pretty bad at quitting, but that's why we're all here right?

I have a history of experiencing  pretty rough withdrawal  symptoms that last around 10 days after I completely stop or drastically reduce my intake. It can be difficult to find information online, so this time around I figured I'd document how I felt throughout the process and some things that make it a little easier. I'd love for anyone who has experienced similar symptoms to weigh in on additional symptoms you may have had and ways you successfully mitigated them.

I rated my pain/nausea each day out of 10.

Day 1 - no symptoms 

Day 2 - can feel it coming on a little bit, slight irritability and difficulty getting to sleep

Day 3 - slight gastrointestinal discomfort (2/10), increased burping, mild anxiety, can still eat fine

Day 4 - increased gastrointestinal discomfort/nausea (5/10), feels like a rock in my stomach creating almost complete loss of appetite, inability to control body temperature, night sweats, severe insomnia, mild depression (nothing feels fun or tastes good)

Day 5 - same as Day 4 plus I haven't eaten for more than 24 hours, which creates additional symptoms (dizziness, confusion like my head was in a fog, aches, rumbling stomach, gas, inability to use the bathroom)

Note: Liquids are much easier to consume than solid food, smoothies or other stuff like that helps a ton, overall the most important thing for me is figuring out a way to get something in my stomach because the less I eat during the period of withdrawal the more painful it is. Muscle aches and dizziness reduce as I force myself to eat even though I feel like throwing it all up.

Day 6 - other stuff continues, gastrointestinal pain heavily increased (7/10) starting to severely affect daily activities and mood, really down in the dumps here

Day 7 - Extremely hungry and feel terrible, all symptoms increased severity (8/10)

Smoked again, immediate relief of all symptoms. (Sorry guys, this would have been much more scientific if I didn't mess up on this day. My bad.)

Bad headache going to sleep.

Day 8 - all symptoms return as soon as I wake up, (6/10). Had a smoothie around noon, feel WAY better after getting something semi-solid in my stomach. 

Evening on Day 8 - pain reduced significantly (2/10), reduced nausea, able to eat some chicken for dinner which made me feel worse again, increased pain to 4/10 but not terrible like Day 6/7

Nighttime on Day 8 - feel pretty good, no pain, still feel a little off but mostly normal (1/10)

Day 9 - morning nausea and stomach pain (2/10), annoying but manageable, not affecting mood or activities, fades as the day goes on, drinking fluids/smoothies helps, eating solid food makes it worse

Evening/Nighttime on Day 9 - ate a decent dinner (mashed potatoes, asparagus, pork) still not super hungry but had a little appetite and no symptoms after eating this time

Day 10 - slight nausea (1/10) right after waking up, after that all normal, appetite rapidly returning 

Day 11 - same as day 11, still getting better

Day 12+ - back to normal

TAKEAWAYS:

The worst parts of this for me were the nausea, general depression, and inability to control body temperature.

**Smoothies are a LIFESAVER** and if I had to do this again that's all I would consume during days 4-8. It's EXTREMELY important to get nutrients because not eating just added more (potentially worse in the long run) symptoms on top of the crappy ones I already had. 

For controlling body temperature, I found it much more effective to drink hot or cold drinks rather than wrap up in blankets or sit in front of the AC.

I lost about 5 pounds over the 12 days I recorded my symptoms.

&#x200B;

Day 5: Night sweats set in, can't get more than 3-4 hours of sleep a night broken into 1-2 hour chunks, usually wake up panicking/heart racing

Day 7: Go to the doctor with a panic attack, appetite starts to return and I eat my first full meal

Day 8: First time my mood took an upswing, brain fog sets in

Day 10: I notice that my heart is calming down and the chills are mostly gone

Day 14-18: Strength starts coming back and I'm able to stay upright all day, night sweats fade and I start sleeping 8 hours a night

Day 25: Appetite seems to be fully back, I start snacking during the day

Having to work makes it more difficult for my anxiety. I work in the corporate world so I am always in meetings and shit and having to talk to people. Luckily I work from home so face to face interaction isn't necessary. I've always considered myself a strong speaker. But with this anxiety...I can literally hear the shaking in my voice. I'm stumbling on words. Physically shaking and sweating as I speak. 

When I'm done with a meeting I have to like just sit to try and calm down. Killing my productivity.

I did a few chores yesterday that were a bit laborious and I found that doing those tasks did much better at helping me ignore the anxiety. But when I gotta work on a computer all day and talk to people, I just bathe in the anxiety all damn day.

I quit five days ago and haven't noticed cold hands and feet for the past couple days at least. My feet don't have the dark hue to them that let's me know they aren't getting enough blood. I've noticed that when I relax my body I get better circulation, and I'm normally in a very physically stressed and tense state. I guess more of that was due to using weed than I thought.

I've hit a wall after 5 years of nearly daily use. I have gone from a productive, happy, satisfied person and a great parent, to a burned out husk of myself. When the suicidal thoughts began a couple months ago and wouldn't leave, I knew it was probably the weed. It's been a scary time because I can't leave those feelings behind. 

After vacation this past week, where I spent the whole trip blazed and living it up, I decided it needed to end. I got home and couldn't care for myself or my kids. My anxiety about returning to work after vacation was sky high (sorry for the unintended pun), and I started having intense panic attacks. I've not had them before until maybe 6 months ago and they are escalating. Again, I figured it had to be the weed. But it's so much easier to numb those feelings with weed and feel immediately better, than to really deal with them.

Today is Day 3 and I feel like absolute hell. I keep waking up throughout the night drenched in sweat, having full-blown panic attacks and sometimes crying. I've also got the headaches, nausea, exhaustion, etc. But the anxiety and depression are the worst. 

I'm steady in my resolution to keep this up. I never ever want to feel like this again. I'm doing this for me, my partner and my kids.

If you feel the urge to get high, practice self care instead (read a book, walk, take a bath, watch something funny, be creative, etc, etc). Post about what you're feeling here. It could buy you enough time to change your mind about relapsing.

You're gonna have good days, and you're gonna have some very bad days. But eventually, you will outrun this thing. If you slip up, don't fall back into it. Pick yourself up and start a new streak. Don't lie to yourself about ""moderation"". You are addicted to a substance that is damaging your brain. The only way is to stop completely.

Lastly, many of us are experiencing depression, anxiety, paranoia, delusions, PTSD, etc. Many of these conditions are caused or exacerbated by weed. Some of these conditions are masked by weed. Quitting weed cured my paranoia and delusions. Therapy and medication eliminated my depression. Please talk to your doctor about what you're experiencing. If you broke your leg, you'd see a doctor. Your mental health is no different.

I’m 20 years old. Been smoking pretty much everyday since I was 16 (quit a few times for a month or less). I’ve been on prescription medication for the past 2 and a half years for anxiety. I go to a school for young people who don’t know what they wanna do (education/job wise). 

I’ve been lurking in this sub Reddit for a couple of months, and on New Year’s Eve I finally decided to quit. I wanted to quit because I don’t like where I am in my life at all, and I feel like weed is just helping me to not think about it. I feel like weed has made me only think about the present moment and when I can smoke the next joint. I’ve not been thinking (enough) about what the hell I want to be doing with my life, so now one paying for it. All my friends are taking an education and I feel like a loser for not having a plan..

I don’t really know where I’m going with this, but I really need some encouragement cause I’m slowly turning into an alcoholic at night. I’ve been drinking every night to help me sleep (can’t sleep anyway).. but I’ve been used to having an escape from reality every night so it’s very hard to just sleep. I’ve been running or going to the gym every day to try and tire myself out, but it doesn’t work cause I’m not sleeping anyway..

I’m starting to get cravings again and my mind is telling me life with weed ain’t even that bad.

I'm on day 8 of sobriety currently. On day 6 I nearly gave in and actually ended up picking up but didn't end up using despite the horrific withdrawal. On day 7 I had a Dr's appointment where they took an ECG, the results came back that I have biatrial enlargement (an enlarged heart). There is a good chance this is down to the years of cannabis use.

When you use cannabis it dose actually put quite a bit of strain on your heart as it raises your blood pressure and heart rate, then eventually it lowers both. I have a plan in place to try and repair some of the damage, cardio everyday, no caffeine, reduce salt intake etc. I just feel like such a fool now though, to know I've but my self at a much higher risk of heart attack or stroke just because of weed. Even though I have the weed sitting in my draw at home I'm too terrified to even smoke it anymore and feel ridiculous for buying again and wasting the money when I'm not exactly well off.

I suppose I wanted to post this as a cautionary tale and vent my frustration at myself. It's very easy to ignore the internal damage you could be doing to your body especially if you have no symptoms, and especially when weed has this reputation of being 'healing' but that is definitely not always the case.

I also yelled God dammit so loud I drew stares in public while running when my Bluetooth headphones disconnected. I also threw said headphones into the garbage disposal in front of my FIL when they did it again during a Zoom meeting. Protip: Don’t fuck with Bluetooth until you’re emotionally stable. 

Aside from that I’m managing, but I feel like shit and only started to eat again at dinner tonight. 

I have a heavy feeling in my chest and the brain fog I feel while sober makes me very aware of what I’ve been doing to myself. My brain feels numb and I’m worried the worst is definitely yet to come since this hasn’t been too hard. I’m at my in-laws for another 10 days so I’m hopeful I can cope with a 6 hour flight with a 2 year old that lands at midnight. Getting away from my home and taking off work has been key in making these days go as good as can be expected. I was paralyzed with fear of withdrawal for months before this as I expected this to be really hard. When I tried a couple times at home to just slow down it was much harder. I can’t get it here without a lot more effort so that’s helpful. It’s just not an option. I’m nervous for home where there are more dispensaries than fast food joints it seems. And, part of me today thought: Maybe it will be easier than you feared, but I’m still scared. Last time I tried I immediately relapsed due to massive amounts of stress and had a huge destructive episode in my home. I let myself relapse because I was really out of control. 

This thing with my chest is unexpected. It’s like there is a weight on my chest and throat. It gets worse with the cravings, but is always there. I noticed it some after I would smoke too which was one thing that pushed me to quit. It went away for a little while, but is back with a vengeance. It’s a little like heartburn I think, but I never really get heartburn so I’m not sure. And, for the first time in forever I could actually clear my throat today. I remember reading once weed affects the muscles the helps you do that. 

I can’t wait to feel “normal” again, but I can’t remember what that was like. I don’t miss being high yet even if I’m craving the chemicals I’m happy to sober for a change.

I'm 31 and I've been smoking everyday for 16 years. I have skipped a couple days but not more than 10 and never 2 in a row. I would wake and bake before work, smoke as soon as my shift was over (before I even started walking back home) and smoke all night afterwards. 

I had some personnal issues that gave me a LOT of anxiety last summer. I had never been anxious before but these events kinda broke me. I started having panic attacks. I kept smoking, a little less, but still...

Then a week ago, I had another huge panic attack that lasted all night. I decided enough was enough.

I went cold turkey.

I was staying at my parents for the holidays.

Told them I was sick, probably from eating too much (lol) but I had solid withdrawal symptoms.

Now it's been 8 days since I quit. I still have some headaches, my throat is tight and my heart is beating like crazy, but I'm proud and I know all these symptoms will eventually go away.

I NEVER tought I could stop before last summer. I was convinced I would smoke 'till my old days.

I feel that I have woken up from a fog and the past four years didn't happen.

Here we Go again. Small insight into my weed history:

I started with 17-18 years. Smoked for many years daily but only in the evening. Then I realized it was to much. Stopped with 27 and started again using but less, sometimes only on the weekends. Between 27 and 32 (today) I smoke sometimes more and sometimes less. I know I'm addicted but the thing is, if there is no weed I'm fine. 

The big problem for me is this: when I have weed at home I smoke it until it's gone. In my country it's not legal and you can not buy just one joint and be happy. You have to buy weed for 50€ from the dealer and I smoke it until it's gone and then I'm really hooked again because it takes me three weeks to finish it (smoking daily). When I'm finished with the 50€ I feel the effects: more depression, bad moods, bad sleep, no willpower etc. 

But If I only smoke one joint or maybe two times a month everything is fine and I'm not ""addicted"" again(I mean that I don't have the urge to buy more and stay high). I know this because I tried. I'm starting to have problems when I smoke more then 3-4 days straight.

It would be so nice to have a shop to buy just one joint every two weeks. Would be the perfect middle ground for me. 

Right now it's time to stop smoking weed because I can not control my behavior when I have weed for 50€. I can decide between being high for three weeks straight and not smoking at all. I decided to stop smoking because it's not working for me. 

I know I sound like ""nah I can handle it"" but it's true. I don't wanna quit smoking forever because it's good for me in small amounts. Again at the moment I have to stop because there is no other way. 

Wish me luck.

I took the decision of leaving marijuana on 31th eve, there are many reasons including not being able to enjoy the effect anymore due to a lot of shit coming into my life and basically having overused it for too much time (regular heavy smoker from 6 years).

The trigger of this decision was that a relationship with a woman I cared a lot ended for many reasons, including me being high EVERYTIME I had the possibility, leading to situations were I definitely should have not been high. 
These situations include when she needed emotional support and I was scarce, dinners with her parents, social occasions with mutual friends. I guess u can imagine.

After the breakup I found myself smoking in a compulsive way, even more than before,  and analyzing what happened for days, until I took this decision (and many more not related to this subreddit). 

I feel that now the feeling of smoking is definitely bonded with all the thoughts about my ex, especially the romantic ones, which definitely cause ansiety, depression and you name it. 

Today I went skiing with one of my old friends whom is a hard smoker, I gifted him some of my product and I truly enjoyed the experience of being with him super high after he killed the joint literally in front of me (but not too close to inhale passive smoke).

At the beginning I swear it was super funny, but then we restarted skiing and I saw him performing soooo bad (he is much more skilled than me), loosing orientation, being super weird in general and even a bit childish. 
Then I experienced him becoming silent, absent, melancholic and loosing the will to continue skiing.

My personal suspicion is that smoke exacerbates the effects THC has on the sympathetic nervous system, whereas clean oils don't do so as intensely.

When I quit smoking, I started with quitting flower. I only smoked carts and grams for a couple of weeks, and then quit the concentrates altogether. I think this helped buffer the effects that flower withdrawal caused, and then made it easier when I was ready to end all cannabis use.

Reading your comments and shared experiences is so helpful, but what is really helpful is re-reading my own to strengthen my resolve. I encourage everyone to post and then revisit your post when you struggle.

I’m on Day 3 of who knows how many times I’ve quit. I’m an older dude who first encountered it in middle school, but really went in head first in college. When I look back on my life now, it seems pretty obvious I was addicted to the high almost immediately. It started as a party drug on the weekends, but quickly became an everyday thing, then in summer I started smoking during the day and finally before I went to work. College was hard for me as I had little support from my parents and worked two full time jobs and a full class load for four straight years. The only days I didn’t have work or school was Thanksgiving and Christmas (maybe New Years, but I don’t remember I was stoned). I started using heavy and would massive bong rips basically every time I left my house. By my senior year, I was stoned for everything all the time and would gleefully announce that I was never quitting this wonder drug. 

I found a job quickly in my field in my college town so I soon had more time and money for weed and I took it. My new boss quickly realized I was a stoner and we’d leave work together to get high constantly. I existed like this for another four years. I was also a big snowboarder and whitewater kayaker - two sports where lots of folks smoke. I would use weed to calm anxiety before dangerous whitewater runs. I spent a lot of time alone and was oblivious to the many opportunities I missed professionally, romantically, and socially because I just wanted to get high. I did meet someone eventually and I realized I had to get away from weed because it was overwhelming me. I took a job out of state, bought an ounce and hit the road. I watched that giant bag get smaller and smaller each day until it was gone and I was terrified. I told myself when that was gone I was quitting. Of course, I found a hookup and smoked on. I was 25 and this lasted about four years. 

I took another job out of state after several promotions with my old company. It was much easier, but had a commute so I would smoke on the way in and home. I left that field for a new career and new job. I was stoned most of the time. 

At my new job, I stopped smoking in the morning initially, but pretty soon I was showing up stoned. Broke up. Smoked more. Lived alone for a year and spent it high in a shitty apartment. Most weekends I wouldn’t even leave the house. I worked my way up to a leadership position in my company still smoking constantly though I stopped here and there. 

Then, weed became legal in a nearby state and I would take off work to go buy it and my consumption sky rocketed. I thought legal weed was great, but it was so bad for me. So much stronger and at least for me more addictive plus with legal weed there was always a supply. Soon my state passed it too and now my supply was everywhere. I left a bad relationship I’d been in for 5 years for my current one. I spent the last year of the old one secretly stoned all the time. All the time.

My new girl was tolerant and even smoked some. I slowed down but still snuck it. Two years ago during the pandemic I woke up one day and said I’m going to smoke through this and started vaping. It quickly took control because it’s so easy to do and conceal. A cartridge could last a month, then two weeks, then a week and then less than five days. I knew I was losing it and tried to quit. Failed. Slow down. Couldn’t.

So finally I tricked my addict brain.  I take a long break to see family each Christmas. I brought two cartridges with me and convinced myself I could make them last. The guilt, self reflection and desire to quit motivated me and I ran out three days ago. I’m here for two more weeks and will have a nice momentum when I get home.

You have to have so much individual willpower but more than that, you have to constantly remind yourself of the reasons why you started this journey in the first place.

You have to want this more than anyone because the truth is no one is coming. No one will come to stop you from relapsing.

I was unresponsive, dismissive, and rude, not because I wanted to be, but because my brain was in a daze from the herb.

After smoking pretty much every day for upwards of 4 years, it finally hit me that the very things I was using weed to self medicate; my depression and anxiety, was all being amplified now. 

I spent the greater part of this year having panic attacks almost daily, screaming about killing myself at the slightest miscommunication and indication that I had done wrong, all while stoned out of my mind. I was abusive and unhinged.

While I'm not so delusional or naive to think the weed was the cause of that, it was certainly exacerbating the existing problem and hindering my recovery. As of September, I am now being treated for my mental illness, but it hasn't been enough. So I have made a pact to quit this and fully dedicate myself to fixing my brain.

The hardest part was telling my parents. They knew I smoked, but I was less than honest with them about the frequency. I came clean to them about the past year, about the role weed played in the hospital visits, in the late night crying phone calls, in the fights and the traumatizing effect on my partner. I was ashamed. I am ashamed.

A week in, I feel irritable, I'm plagued by night sweats, and my motivation still isn't where I want it to be. But at the same time, I feel hopeful and optimistic for the future for the first time in a while. 

I spent so long just waiting to get home so I could light up, I wasn't enjoying my life. And now I feel like I can.

Quitting is worth it. And who knows, maybe somewhere down the line I'll be able to enjoy a little on a special occasion. But for now, I'm done.

I feel so blessed to have a partner who supported me through all of this, stayed with my though my struggles and is still supporting me through this journey. I don't know where I would be without them.

As I've mentioned in other posts, I am soooooo extremely fortunate to have my sleep not be greatly impacted. I had a really strong sleep routine prior to this one month binge that I think is really serving me well now. 

So I wake up today with good old morning anxiety. Pretty intense anxiety...the kind that makes you gag and want to puke l from nervousness. I down a bowl of oatmeal and a fruit smoothie. Helped some but still anxious.

My kids FINALLY went back to daycare today. Not having them in the house all day is a huge weight off my shoulders.

I went for a run this morning as well. I am a pretty consistent runner but I took a bre during my one month binge. I'm not a great runner but I average around a 9 min mile. I usually run 3 miles in the morning. So this morning I ran and I immediately felt a surge of endorphins. Which was great! I was smiling for a bit while running. But I got winded really fast. I only lasted about 15 minutes when I tend to run for about 30mins. So I dont know. My lungs were hurting. Ill keep it up and hopefully my endurance returns.

About to try to eat lunch...so we will see how that goes. Appetite is still a little weak, but coming back. Last night I crushed a couple eggs and a piece of toast. Felt good. 

I think thing are definitely getting better. Number 1 symptom is anxiety now. It always been a symptom since day 1 but since some of the other symptoms are starting to die down a little, the anxiety takes the spotlight. 

I did have a little breakdown, crying episode right before my run though. Random emotional surge. Hate that shit. Makes me feel like I have zero control.

I'm a 25 y/o F and my parents met through sobriety. My father was a drug addict and same with my mother. They met at a sober Halloween party in the 90s. All my life I thought I ""avoided"" this ""trait"" that is a huge part of my DNA- addiction. My mom and dad revel at the fact that their daughter is ""normal"" and isn't like them when they were in their 20s. The secret? I'm addicted to weed and I can't stop.

I started daily smoking recently, in June of 2021. Before, I rarely did it alone and now that vape cartridges are available, and there's a dispensary down the street from work, I can't stop. I smoked from a pen because it was available, easy, and a crutch. I'm a public service worker working through COVID and this year has been incredibly hard on me. When I went for one week on a vacation with my family in July, I realized I had a strong codependency. I was sharing a room with my (sober) mother who doesn't know I smoke. I had to sneak out of the house to smoke the pen to fall asleep.

Flash forward to January 2022. I wake up on the weekends, smoke. Drive around my town, smoke. Smoke from a one-hitter out of my screen door. I don't enjoy doing the things I used to do. I take 4+ hour naps in the middle of the weekend. I live WITH my parents, and they ""dont know"" but I'm scared of the inevitable - them finding out. I know they would be so kind and so supportive. I mean, they went through it too. But I have lived my whole life being a good daughter, and to disappoint them is an overwhelming thought.

I think tonight I will try to stop. I know it will be hard, but I am sick of living my life in this haze. Any words of encouragement and thoughts are appreciated.

But honestly the longer I am sober the more I realise the negative impacts and the less I ever want to go back. For real. I still have brain fog, dodgy memory and don’t feel too sharp yet on my bad fays, but I am improving and trending better overall. Most cravings stopped after 2-3 weeks.

I am disgusted at the amount of tar I have coughed up. But better out then in though hey? Multiple doctors have advised it’s fine and expected. But shit, dirty bongs are TARRY. I am still coughing up tarry crap every odd day or so, no where near as bad though. My lungs feel so much better. A main reason for quitting was I was short of breathe. My mind feels more racy. I am adjusting to not being stoned 24/7. I feel I am more anxious but that’s more of a recent development and recovery is not linear (plus, xmas and NYE diet/drinking definitely factors in).

For whoever needs to read it. I promise it’s worth it. It might seem hard but it really is just the first few weeks (in my experience), and you no longer want it. As more time passes I want it less.

I smoked for 5-6 years. Daily for last 3-4. Gram a day roughly. Bongs, vapes and the occasional J. I’m in my mid 20s.

Other symptoms I’ve had: headaches (plenty), sore joints, moodiness. Mostly I’m good though. I’ve made some efforts to go for runs as well, I highly encourage this. Definitely been the biggest accelerator to my recovery in my opinion.

1. I am a 65 y.o. female who has been struggling with ""The Change"" for 17 years, and
2. I am a weed user / abuser since 1973, and have many 'quit' attempts under my belt... and I'm telling you straight up - the symptoms are virtually identical.

The things you are battling right now -- insomnia / night sweats / anxiety / mood and appetite swings -- are all hallmarks of menopause. I know some of you reading this right now are probably balking madly at this comparison. Find it, oh I dunno... insulting, demeaning, dismissive. I assure you, it's not. I have depth of experience with both menopause and quitting weed, and I'm telling you straight up -- the first few weeks of quitting are basically y'all experiencing what every woman over the age of 55 on this planet, goes through at some point in their life. And not just for a week or two. For years. (Cue the song ""I Enjoy Being A Girl""....!)

For tips on how to deal with night sweats in particular, I did a post last year called ""I Am The Night Sweat Queen And I Am Here To Help You"". Check it out for tips on how to cope.

All of you out there struggling with the first weeks symptoms, I can offer you hope. Because, unlike menopause symptoms, these \*will\* go away in a few weeks / a couple of months. They won't last for years like 'the change' does.

I fell off my sobriety wagon in December, like many of us - but back on again. And therefore, back to a week of the symptoms we all struggle through. But I give a bitter laugh, 'cause frankly, at this point in my life, I can't tell where the weed sweats & insomnia start & end, and the menopause sweats / insomnia start & end.

I'm up 4 times a night. I'm blotting myself with paper towels because sweat is pouring off my forehead, hairline, neck, inside my elbows and wrists, behind my knees, under my boobs.... I can't sleep, and toss and turn in the wee small hours.... is it weed withdrawal ? or just another day in my 65 y.o. life ? Dunno. Don't care. Irrelevant. All I know is that when it happens  because of my stupid choices regarding smoking weed it's my own fault. And menopause - even if it's disruptive and a MASSIVE pain in the arse - is at least part of Nature's plan.

Hang tough y'all. It \*will\* pass.

For the last 4 years, I’ve been smoking just about constantly, using a thc distillate pen every second I could & going through a 1 gram cart every 2 days. Before that, I was smoking a half ounce of flower every 5 days. 

The other piece of this story is that I’ve been an on/off opiate addict since I was 15. I am a big supporter of harm reduction, & I don’t think I could’ve kicked h*roin or even m*thadone without thc. When I transferred to s*boxone, I started getting severe anxiety any time I smoked. It was debilitating, but my body/mind were still dependent on thc. 

I took a trip overseas for the whole month of November, & I decided that was a great time to stop smoking. However, withdrawals are a lot worse than I would have expected. Now it’s been 2 months, most of the appetite & irritability symptoms have subsided. The anxiety still comes in waves, but it’s gotten better. 

The one thing that still happens to me that is making my life miserable are the night terrors. I have the most vivid dreams, even taking a 1 hour nap feels like I’ve spent multiple days inside of my dream. They’re not always nightmares, but they’re always surreal & they always have some component of anxiety or other negative emotions. Sometimes they are downright horrifying. 

I’m wondering if this is normal, I know people have vivid dreams when they stop using thc but I didn’t know it would last 2 months after I quit. I also still get heart palpitations & I’m wondering if that’s part of it or if that may be something else.  

Sometimes I feel like I used such a copious amount of thc so frequently that my problems now are unique to me, but there’s always someone out who did more than you who also quit. Im wondering if that person is in this sub & could tell me when I’ll feel normal again.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences, I've just spent the last hour reading them and they've been extremely helpful. I have been a daily smoker for 10 years. I never thought marijuana could be an issue because ""it's just marijuana"" but I was completely wrong.   
I have always been quite high functioning on paper, but I am completely addicted to smoking marijuana and I know its ruining my life, suppressing my talents, contributing to my depression, making my anxiety worse and honestly just making me feel like a shell of a human. In 2019, my skin broke out into terrible hormonal acne, and I actually quit cold turkey because the anxiety around my skin was so bad. I experienced no physical or psychological withdrawals thankfully (I'm not sure if this was because I was hyper fixated on healing my skin or I was just really busy in uni or if I just didn't experience it).   
Sobriety was amazing; same thing that we're all talking about here - I almost felt like sober was a drug within itself because I hadn't experienced what it feels like to not be high. I was more confident, could hold conversations better, my dreams returned, my appetite was naturally there and didn't have to be induced by weed, like you name it, everything was just better. In May 2020 right at the start of the pandemic, I had been feeling really great sober and decided to smoke up again, that one decision... and here we are Jan 2022. It took many months for me to get to the same spot that I was pre 2019 quit, but especially over these most recent holidays like I just could not put the pipe down.   
Currently, I am a bit shameful. Shameful that I have let myself get to this spot again. However, I am really proud of myself for taking this step and realizing that this is becoming an issue again. I don't think I can be a casual user, I believe for me its either permabaked or don't touch it at all. I am just really excited to start living sober again, but a bit nervous that I may go through a withdrawal, or that it may be harder this time as I don't have those same distractions as I did last time.

Update day 2 - thought I’d just keep updating for anyone wanting a real life time line. Feeling much more intense got really bad hot/cold sweats. Also crawling skin and really intense anxiety. Although it sounds pretty hectic I really wanna quit and the thought of wanting to quit beats the symptoms. Going strong 👊👊",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40305445}"

I thought *fuck it*. We're in lockdown for a month, I'm just going to smoke myself through it. Before then I had enjoyed smoking periodically: maybe once every few months or a couple times a month depending on the season. I'd been this way for a couple of years and never had any problems.

But March 2020 was the beginning of an insidious takeover that I was completely naive to. I smoked every day under the pretence that it was all justified. That the world had just plunged into chaos. Hoodwinked into an unprecedented snap lockdown. Come April: I was confounded by the past month and the state of the world. COVID steamed ahead and cemented itself in history. And I had been blowing it all away in smoke. A time where we were barred from seeing our family and friends. An upheaval of everything we knew to be normal. It was the most dangerous time to be getting into anything haha

I did though. After a month of good highs, I wanted something higher. Naturally I thought to other drugs and literally everything bid me to take them. In my mind, it was like a free pass. The best time to play. When everything and the world around me was in disarray, I could go away unnoticed. and I did. I had the time of my life. But in doing this I had unknowingly opened Pandora's box.

At the time all was well. Better than. I had beautiful trips, I had disheartening trips. But as is with these things, I was very fond of them as a whole. Within this space in time I had breaks with smoking. Sometimes I'd have two weeks off, other times I'd smoke a couple times through the week. Come July, I had had my time with the higher highs and thought it be a good time to hang up the phone. However, I didn't want the magic to leave me, so I continued in my smokes. And again...everyday it was.

Over the next couple of months, as I was in my cloud, an unsettling feeling began to line it. Like a creeping, emerging feeling of uneasiness. Unknowing of what to really do about it, I continued further in my smokes until NY 2021. At which time I had found myself in plight. When I looked back on my year, I could hardly recognise myself and it saddened me. It all went so fast I missed it. I looked back and I couldn't remember the individual events... only *the event* itself. Being my time in the cloud.

And all I knew, is that somewhere during all of this, I had lost a special part of myself. It seemed as if I had been running on autopilot for all those months. And all my old habits, gone. Mannerisms, gone. My individuality stripped from me, replaced by something universal but largely impersonal. And I missed myself. So much.

I had a week or two being sober after NY until I went back to it. I dealt with a lengthy conflicted inner dialogue and come late March, I was weary. A full loop: March to March. Tired and over it. And I knew I had to let it go.

So I did. I made a promise I wouldn't smoke until NY 2022 and I kept it. But it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. And I'm a different man today but at least I'm myself.

It calls me today, and I don't know what to do. I don't have my promise protecting me any longer.

There was a time before all this where I smoked and everything was fine. Where I could wake up the next morning with nothing changed and everything good.

I just don't want to light up tonight and wake up tomorrow, only to find myself lost again",5,"{'covid': 2, 'lockdown': 2}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4684727}"

I'm a weed smoker and have been for probably 7-8 years how, mainly 1-2 joints a day, which many won't call this a problem but it is for me. 

I have tried to stop multiple times throughout each year and I once managed around 16 days. Every other time it's been a few days as something good would happen at work and I'd reward myself or many times it was just boredom. 

Today I tried again to stop and so far I am 1 day in on my journey of not smoking. All good so far but I suppose the worst is still to some. I am going to try and update the thread each day as I think it'll help me and may help others today. 

Edited here 

I have also started jogging today which has helped a lot as I'm tired and it filled up some time, albeit not a lot of time lol. 

So, Day 1: Tried my best to fill up my time, learn something new and went for a jog etc - Felt good when it got later on in the day and I didn't really have the urge or thought to get any which can only be a good sign - the dreaded sleep is still to come.

Earlier this week I celebrated a year of sobriety!

I am very thankful for this group. When I began my sobriety journey, I often read success stories here. Today, I want to share my story.

I began using marijuana in the ninth grade. There was a creek near the high school and there we smoked before school, during lunch, after school... I smoked a lot. I liked seshing, and people celebrated my big bong rips. I had a nickname and helped grow a weed culture. Something I am really ashamed of.

After many arguments and worsening family relationships, I stopped smoking weed. I was sober throughout the tenth grade, but after my final exam, I was paraded to the creek. I queued a guitar solo, then ripped the fattest popper and ghosted it. I have zero recollection of that afternoon.

After that day, my marijuana addiction lingered with me for about six years.

I graduated high school, then post-secondary school. I still had dreams. But I watched many of my friends pack their dreams into a bowl and light them up.

Using marijuana made me depressed, really depressed. Today, I am still unpacking my marijuana use. I think I was using marijuana to preserve some self-image. When using marijuana, I could detach myself from responsibility. If I failed a test, I would remind myself that ""I would have done better if I were sober"". Today, I think that failure can be motivational.

I wanted to stop using marijuana because I felt like a failure.

The journey has been difficult. Some months ago, I felt like I was drowning under a wave of regret. Discomfort needed to be endured and challenges had to be overcome. I really wanted to recover quickly, regain the wits I thought I lost. But I could not force my recovery. I guess there is some truth to the cliché *time heals all wounds*.

I feel really blessed that I have discovered many gifts along my journey. Now, I look forward to the future. But my journey is not over, more challenges await me and hopefully more gifts do too.

I have to say, the support in this group is unfathomable, you guys are awesome.

The difference with this time quitting is that I feel as though I really want to. 

And since I really want to, I have taken my withdrawal symptoms seriously instead of simply trying to ignore them. 

These past three days I have practised more self-care than I have in the 5 years I spent smoking everyday. I truly believe that these actions are mitigating my withdrawals.

The reason I am posting is to list the acts of self care I am implementing in the hopes they will help others the way they are helping me. I also would appreciate advice from others who are actively combatting their withdrawal symptoms.

Here is a list of acts of self-care that have been helping me through this battle:

-meditating for 10 minutes a day (strictly trying to focus on just breathing

-eating a proper diet full of protein(as much as I can even when I have no appetite/ feel nauseous)

-drinking 3L of water daily

-exercising daily for an hour(simply push-ups and planks)

-making myself a hot chocolate at night when I’ve settled down (usually I would be ripping a massive bowl)

I am quitting because I want to reach my true potential and these days I feel as though weed is seriously holding me back. I plan to start reading, writing, and working on projects I’ve been dwindling on for years (but I’m taking it one step at a time). 

I would love to hear what you guys do to help with your withdrawals.",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6660377}"

\- made the decision to quit May '21 after five decades of use, the last 20 years pretty much daily   
\- educated myself about weed and it's effects by reading well researched, well written books.... one of which sent me here to this sub reddit (thank you !)  
\- downloaded an app to help me track my quit progress  
\- got my (non smoking) spouse on side by confessing how bad my problem was, and soliciting their help, and he's been bloody brilliant regarding support  
\- cut back or cut out people in my circle of friends, that would only be triggers for me or drag me back into heavy use  
\- took up yoga, and tried meditation to help (yoga = yes / meditation = meh. At least for me) and started a journal (which I still use, and find most helpful)  
\- pitched every single piece of paraphernalia and have not replaced it  


Cons:  
\- relapsed 3 times since May, each time for a period of 4 - 6 weeks. 

\- every time a relapse happened, it was because of a stressful event, and that I thought I could have a couple of joints, ""just to take the edge off"" and manage to moderate. And I think we all know how that goes for addicts like us, right ?.... Uh huh. :P

\- living in a country where weed is legal means when I relapsed, I just would pop into a dispensary and buy pre-rolls, rationalizing they were just ""small"" one-of's versus buying an entire ounce. Until the small ""one-of's"" were adding up to 7 joints / 3 grams per day and costing me $510 / month in pre-rolls  


Summary  
\- back on the Quit Wagon. Because Winston Churchill was right: ""Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, NEVER !--in nothing, great or small, large or petty--never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense.""

\- my app shows that despite set-backs, that since my May '21 quit date, I managed to reduce my consumption by 37.5%. So after 50 years of use, and 20 years of abuse of weed... I will take that as a WIN !!! and build upon it in 2022  


Thank you ALL ! young and old, male and female, straight or queer, American, European, Aussies, and fellow Canucks, for your tales of how you quit and what you learned. I take some knowledge away with every post I read. Especially those of you with 90+ days of sobriety, and most especially, the aspirational posts from those with a year or more of sobriety. You have cut hard trail, and I hope to follow in your footsteps. Your stories parallel mine in so many ways, that when I hear of a success, I think ""Well, maybe I can parallel that success too .....""

2022-01-03 17:40:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rve7mc/literally_scared_straight_by_my_own_use/,Literally “scared straight” by my own use,"Last night was the last time I used MMJ and I will never use again.

I felt like my head was going to explode. It wasn’t anxiety, but one of the worst headaches I’ve ever experienced. I had pain, but more than that, I had immense pressure that felt like my temples were going to burst. I kept getting intrusive thoughts that were graphic and that *did* give me anxiety, so overall my night sucked.

I’ve been debating quitting for awhile, but that experience was a “scared straight” moment for me. In the past I’ve had momentary amnesia where I forgot where I was, who anyone was, and even things like the fact that I have a mother. It was like I had to relearn everything. I’ve also had an uptick in paranoia and possible hallucinations.

At first MMJ was my saving grace, especially when I couldn’t sleep without it. I’d previously tried supplements recommended by my psychologist, but they built tolerance so quickly that I’d have to take a lot to get sleep. After that I got into legal products and then MMJ and it went downhill from there.

I’m still not sure what I’ll do to get some sleep. I have PTSD that causes nightmares, night terrors, anxiety dreams, and nighttime panic attacks. Add in hypervigilance, paranoia, and possible hallucinations *even when sober* and it’s no wonder I can’t rest. But I need to do something healthier. Maybe exercise.

I really wish I didn’t have this issue. I tried convincing myself that THC was the issue and products without it would be okay, but I know in my heart that I’d take much more than I need just to try to feel high. So obviously that’s a no-go.

What sucks the most is wanting to reach for it. Luckily my partner is going to handle the dumping of all my things so I don’t have to even hold it. It’s embarrassing that I got so dependent and at the first sign of stress, I crave it. But addiction of all kinds runs in my family, and I have already (mostly) conquered a food addiction of my own. I know I can do this.

Anyway, I’m mostly writing this to keep myself accountable in an anonymous way. I know you’ll all understand what I mean… I can talk to my partner but I can’t exactly bring this up to many people and it’s probably not healthy to do that anyway.

I’ve thought about going to an MA meeting but I have crippling social anxiety so I probably won’t. I’ll just continue to lurk on here and maybe share an update sometimes.

After my parents died of Covid in march of this year I decided to change my life, I was ok where I was, great job, family, house, married my college sweetheart and have an amazing relationship, there was no red flags to say, dude, quit, but I was living in a third world country ( Perú) and as much as I was part of the white rich upper echelon of society and could pretty much do whatever I wanted I decided that my 30 kilos overweight, pack a night of cigarettes and 10 bowl smoking habit from 9pm to 3am was just ridiculous, I was smoking an ounce a week , don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed all of this but I saw how my parents died, they couldn’t get an icu because their chances of surviving were slim and it was in the middle of a huge wave, icu waiting time, 15 days, I even offered a hospital 150 k. I got to at least say bye to them and with all the protective gear I walked the halls of Lima’s biggest hospital and the sounds I heard were terrifying, they were last breaths of people in complete agony, I’ve never been that close to death and in such a horrible way, it’s like coughs and death howls that will haunt me for the rest of my life. My parents were separated from each other at the hospital even though I tried to at least get them in the same room, they always hoped to die together, my mom died first on march 5th, then my dad on march 9th, a day before his 65th birthday…they were a bit out of shape, my mom was a cancer survivor (twice) my dad was a diabetic and they were only in their mid to early 60s but Covid got the best of them, worst part is, they got COVID because my mom had to get an operation in her brain that was urgent, she had to spend two nights in a hospital, she went in negative and when she came out after two days she was at home with nobody but my dad taking care of her and he never went out he ordered everything online , 4 days later, COVID . 

I took a long hard look at my life and what I wanted for myself and my daughter, she’s an only child and I feel I have to give her all the knowledge and tools to navigate through what could be a very problematic future, Perú is a country that’s going nowhere, the options for her are very limited, could she be a doctor, lawyer etc, sure…could she be an engineer, hell no, those things aren’t possible there and she would eventually marry some close minded racist elitist rich kid because Lima is a tiny bubble, it’s a city of 10 million people but the upper class is like 50k and we all know each other, every time you meet someone it’s , what’s your last name? What school did you go to? What club do you frequent? Etc etc , I know, it sound dumb and kind of a dream life but it’s not, it’s a fucking prison and option are very limited. I work in film and I was already working at the highest levels my country had to offer, there was no upgrade, there was no up, there was no challenge…so I said fuck it, I need to change to make this happen and I can’t do it with my mind all clouded and me being comfortable where I was at . My parents died and I told my wife (who is American, I grew up in my late childhood and early adolescence in Canada) that by this time next year we’d be living in the states…so here I am in Florida 2 months of quitting weed and having to have dealt with the sleepless nights, the bad moods, the utter depression, the loneliness and all that comes with it, I quit smoking cigarettes on December 12 and since December 15th I’ve hit the gym everyday at 5:30 in the morning to do an extreme type of boot camp workout for 45 minutes. I don’t know how long I’ll keep going with this but I’m determined to change myself because from this experience I have learned that the only thing you can change in life is yourself and that’s hard as fuck.

I’m a 30 year old husband and father of 2 beautiful young kiddos. Been smoking daily since age 20, so a nice 10 year habit. 

I’ve quit a few times over the past 2 years, a week here and there and even a month once. But I went back to weed when my life got stressful. I explored my undiagnosed ADHD this year and got low doses of the typical prescriptions, which honestly made daily smoking way too easy. I felt like superman with my combination of meds & hourly tokes. “It helps me focus on my work.”

Everything in my life has pushed me to quit this past holiday season. I finally did right before Christmas, while unfortunately spending the holiday away from my kids and partner. Coming up on 2 weeks clean has shown me exactly what I’ve been missing out on all this time; so much mental clarity. 

If you are reading this, you are interested in quitting. Ive been the same way for a while, but something is different this time. Im not trying to remove weed, I’m trying to add up clear days and thats the difference. I’ll say the cravings are much milder this time around - I just don’t want it anymore. 

I took a walk this morning and found an unopened 1/8th sealed on the sidewalk. (!!!) score! I couldn’t believe my eyes. I picked it up with a smile on my face, knowing my plan. Finished up my walk, entered my home and went straight to the toilet. I hummed Taps, opened the baggie, and poured it straight into the water. My first thought could have been “this is the devil tempting me.” But I think it was God showing me my new strength. 

You all have the strength inside of you. Theres just some part of yourself you have to recognize and ignore - the part of you that chooses comfort over growth.

I’ve tried quitting multiple times over the last four years and have only been successful once for about four or five months.  One of my biggest hurdles in quitting is the night sweats.

When I wake up like this, I just want to cry. It usually the middle of the night and I don’t have the will to change the sheets. Sometimes I’ll put a towel down. Sometimes I sleep in the floor or just stay up to avoid sweating all over again.

I’m one week sober and this time feels real. I’ve tried to quit so many times and have only ever been successful for a few months, or however long it took for my body to naturally pass a drug test in order to get a new job. And I remember those 2-3 months being excruciating with cravings, but the pressure of needing a job was great enough to override my cravings. 

Personally, I’ve required a deadline of some kind to be able to quit smoking. This time feels different because I need to pass a drug test AND because I want to start a family. Those reasons didn’t do it at first. I told myself I would stop smoking October 2021. I was traveling a lot and it was easy in states where weed isn’t legal. I would go a week without smoking only to travel into a legal state and pick it back up. FOMO is a big trigger for me. I can’t tell you how many ceremonial “last puffs” I had only to freak out about never being able to smoke again and run straight back to it. 

And I have to admit, I’m nervous about what will happen once I’m clean and get a job. What if I’m not pregnant by then and my only remaining deadline becomes a gray area? I’ve moved to a state where it isn’t legal recreationally. But I’m close enough to legal states that if desperation hits I can drive to a friends where I know there is weed a plenty.

I'm very interested in music and like to build my own home control room for producing and mixing music.
Now that I'm practically saving all these money that I had burnt up on weed, my plan is to go through building a DIY control room at home.

Not usually my style, but these rants of mine are getting kinda long.)

Just got about three and a half hours of sleep. Woke up at 3:15 AM and somehow didn't get out of bed until 5:15 AM. (So tired I typed ""PM"" originally in that last sentence.) Not sure exactly what happened during those last two. Withdrawals are making it hard to tell when I'm awake or passed out. That makes twelve hours cumulative over the last three nights.

Shaking quite a bit at the moment. Will probably try to drink some water and eat a light snack before getting back in bed. Unfortunately, my daughter picked this week to start climbing out of hers at night and playing with toys. My wife and I didn't get her down until 11:30 PM on Sunday, and I couldn't calm my heart rate to sleep until 1:45 AM. This insomnia is brutal. Kid usually wakes up around 6:30 AM lately; hopefully her body will delay that given the extremely long prior evening. I could use the extra shut eye.

On the bright side, I didn't sweat as much as I feared I might, and there hasn't been any vomiting yet or bizarre dreams that I can remember. Going to attend a Marijuana Anonymous meeting online today (maybe AA in person as well) just to get some face time with fellow sufferers. Can report back afterward on that if anyone's interested. Might have to tell work I'm sick but still get urgent tasks done whenever my energy level is sufficient. Fingers crossed no one there figures out what's happening.

Let this post serve as a message to anyone (like me) who has only been addicted for a few months. The sooner you choose to let go of weed, the easier it's gonna be (that's the way it seems from browsing this sub all week, anyway). Like Scar tells Simba in *The Lion King*, ""Run away, and never return.""

My stash is still in the bin outside behind my living quarters, and it's going to stay there until collection arrives Wednesday morning. Hopefully my post history on Reddit will serve as a stark reminder in the future of why I should never consume THC again. The potential highs are NOT worth the exit experience as my brain resets to baseline dopamine.

(TLDR: I hate weed because of how it's made me squander much of the last few months. That emotion is strong enough that I'm powering through crummy side effects from quitting. If you're pondering a similar move and aren't sure what to do, read this sub until you're motivated to throw in the towel. Best time to begin the detox process is now; it *will* end.)",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5745582}"

I've been on/off for 14 years, and can relate to pretty much every post here. I've gone through numerous quits and relapses over the years, and last year was the worst where I have been ""wanting"" to quit for the entire year but went though justifications, short stints, and relapses. The longest streak was probably about one month. Even after feeling somewhat ""free"" meaning I'm completely fine without it, I kept going back to it telling myself that now I can finally moderate use. The biggest reason was that I just could not accept the fact that I had to take this out of my life.

I went through pretty much all the things people go through here, and I understand that I need to and want to quit. I understand what it is doing to me, but I just love it so much, even when it isn't doing anything good for me (also relating to the posts about loving the process but not enjoying the high). However, it also destroys me to think that what used to be the best thing in the world for me has turned its back on me. I just wish I could do it in moderation and keep it in my life, but last year's experience has told me that this isn't possible. 

I actually am not too worried about the quitting part. Definitely not trivializing it-- Day2 is already hell and I've gone through this many times so I know what is coming, and I have relapsed so I know. Having done it before doesn't make it any easier, but this time I do have confidence that I will follow through, as I had some really bad episode recently and got tired of the cycle.

How do you deal with saying goodbye to something that you once loved?  
How do you deal with the fact that moderation is not an option?

Turns out drunkenly typing out your sob story is not a good idea. 
 
  
 Well anyway to make a long story short I live with my mom (64) and my older brother (33) I've spent the last 2 years isolated  loff and on a once manageable addiction (meaning I could quit when I really wanted/needed too) has spiraled out to become completely unmanageable. This plant fucking controls me and its one of the only ways I know how to cope. I think bc this new Covid world has broken me. All the death, delusion, impemding recession societal catastrophe one after another. Often times feels like by the end of the decade civility could be completely be gone. Society has been crippled in many ways we can't even understand yet.  On top of that climate change and a global facist assault on democracy.
 

  Its all a lot and on top of all that my mom's lungs are starting to hurt really bad and take a bad turn. I know what you're thinking and no its not Covid bc she's had her shots and booster. Plus she had a case of Delta(mild case) in the summer on top of that so did my brother. She had to get on inhalers afterwards one she uses twice a day. Another she uses only in emergencies.  She has COPD bc of her cancer survival and smoking past. Anyway besides the point she has started to use her emergency very frequently out of nowhere and I'm so afraid something is going to happen. 


  I have many regrets with my mom and it kills me inside she tried to give me everything she could and I have so much resentment in my heart I didn't see it. And it kills me. I'm just 22 and I still live with her bc she's ill and can't move as well is used too. So I do a lot of the of the housework and groceries. For a year it was mainly only me bc I would disinfect everything to the max. I would spray my shoes with lysol and strip down and shower every time I did every thing I could. I cut contact with the world for her and for our family. I'm deathly afraid of this thing it feels like a bioweapon the way it mutates and never fucks off. Like its now the most contaigous disease literally ever. Wtf. Anyway I've ruined my life in a lot of ways.


   I'm very lonely, I haven't worked in over 2 years and no college either. My mom has really bad health problems, my brother is even more isolated and has an emotional reliance on me, and he's raising a joint custody kid on top of that. Found out my highschool Jrotc instructor who took me to Europe is getting worse with his cancer and was in the ER recently.  I've neglected to talk to him as avoidant stoners do. All of this is to much and so I'd rather smoke and watch Youtube than engage. All of this with my mom's money too bc I don't work much except for some Favor here and there. All while her health slowly diminishes before my eyes. 


   She helps but even she wants me to quit. My brother is an addict and he can deal better than I can bc the truth is I'm lost without this comfort. I'm all alone it feels fucking hopeless and I just want it. I want to make this a clean year but its so hard and I'm asking for help. I have my friends I love them to death but they're smokers. I'm going to therapy but I delayed that until March. So this fourm is what I got to motivate me.

This ended up being a long one, my apologies. TL;DR at the bottom. 

&#x200B;

Believe it or not, I didn't go into this new year with the resolution to quit smoking. I've known it was an issue since I picked it back up in July of this year(after 18 months abstinent), but I had no intention of quitting this January. Until today.

It wasn't one thing that made me decide to quit again, but the final call was finding out my roommate's boyfriend has covid. JUST A DISCLAIMER: WE ARE ALL DOUBLE VACCINATED AND WEAR MASKS ANYTIME WE ARE IN PUBLIC. We are absolutely trying to stay safe and prevent the spread of the virus. She found out today and had been with him a few hours yesterday, so there's a pretty decent chance that she'll test positive(we're both getting tested Tuesday bc we are expecting to be snowed in tomorrow.) Luckily, I only saw her briefly today so there is a chance that I'm still good. We will be isolating until we have our results. To be frank, I am not in good health; obese, asthmatic, and constantly coughing due to smoking too much. Basically if I end up catching the virus and being symptomatic there's a decent chance I wouldn't make it. So, finding out this news today was scary to say the least.

&#x200B;

Now here are the other things that have attributed to my decision to quit:

1) I miss dreaming at night/remembering my dreams for more than a millisecond. I used to practice lucid dreaming and it was the most rewarding thing to put in the effort and get to have the dreams of your choosing. I haven't been able to do that again since picking weed back up.

2) My finances are awful. I spend 1k a MONTH on weed because of my high tolerance. I barely make my bill payments and I am not making any profit between what I bring in and what gets spent. ALL OF MY MONEY GOES TO EITHER DRUGS OR BILLS. THAT'S IT.

3) I'm tired of coughing all the time, especially in this age of covid. And I'm tired of making up excuses for why I'm coughing; ""oh, it's my allergies""; ""must be some pet dander in the air""; ""I'm just getting over a cold""; ""I always have a cough this time of year"", ect ect. My boss is genuinely concerned for why I've been hacking my lungs up for the last 5 months without it getting any better, and I have nothing I can tell her beyond the lies. 

4) The anxiety I get if I haven't smoked before work, on my lunch break, before any social obligation(even with my parents), right when I get home, several times throughout the evening, right before bed, and sometimes in the middle of the night.

5) The fact that I'm trying to move out of the country(long term goal) and I was seriously crossing out amazing countries to live in simply because of their policies on marijuana. You know, instead of any other ACTUAL reasons adults move out of state/the country.

6) The absolute rock bottom feeling of being completely out of weed and having no way to get more for at least a few days. I have never felt like more of an addict than when I am calling friends I haven't spoken to in YEARS to see if I can buy off them. That is humiliating. Any day I am non-voluntary abstinent from smoking I am agitated, anxious, and more depressed than ever. Terribly, it spirals into a pity party for myself where I essentially throw a tantrum about how ""unfair it is to me that I can't smoke right now"" as if it's a human right to get high and fuck off. 

7) My life has become stagnant. Still. Stuck. I haven't made any personal or professional progress with my life in over 6 months. You could quite literally copy paste me in July to me in Dec and it would look identical. I hate my job but have no motivation to do anything about it. I'm an artist who hasn't made art in months. I have 3 FULL trash bags of garbage in my room with me right now, and what is probably about 3 more bags of garbage littered on my floor. My depression has only gotten worse this year.

I used to get the munchies and eat endlessly my first few years of smoking--SOMETHING CHANGED THIS TIME AROUND. My appetite is gone. Completely vanished. Before smoking, after smoking, it doesn't matter I have no desire to eat or even drink water. Every morning I feel sick to my stomach and even retch sometimes. I have to force myself to eat everyday so I don't pass out at work or while driving. 

I force myself to smoke every morning at 6am with shaking hands, sometimes in cold sweats, and even when my throat is beyond wrecked from the previous night of chain smoking and hacking. Of course that means I'm coughing my lungs up every morning, sometimes leading to me puking my guts. THEN STILL SMOKING MORE AFTER PUKING. More coughing. I go to work, 4 miserable hours pass, then 45 minutes for lunch. I run a half mile away from my office, climb 5 flights of stairs to the top floor of a parking deck, hide myself from any cars/cameras up there, and chain smoke until my lunch is up. I feel like a fucking criminal every day, terrified someone will stumble upon me looking sketchy as hell. I don't ever eat on my lunch. I get back to work, coughing of course. My coworker makes her daily comment about how I should get it checked out. I say my daily response of ""I will."" I won't. 4 more hours pass, I'm the last one out and I lock the office. I smoke on the walk to my car and again once I pull into grocery store. 

Once in the grocery store, it's time for ""shitty public stoner bingo:"" I get overwhelmed because of all the people, I can't find something and walk in circles, I see someone I know and panic bc I'm high, I knock something over and overreact, I worry strangers are judging me, ect ect. And of course I don't get half of what I needed in the store because I don't fucking remember what I went in for. I pick up 3 things I didn't need to begin with and leave frustrated. I finally finish that ordeal, get home and chuck my groceries away before walking down the hall to my room. It's at this point that I say hey to my roommate if I see her, and if I don't, that means I'll see her tomorrow because as soon as I shut myself in my room, that's the end of my day. Computer games turn on, I start chain smoking bowls and dissociate until I can't keep my eyes open. Then I lay down and sleep dreamlessly for around 5 hours. 

No laundry gets done, no dishes cleaned, no tidying up the mountains of garbage I sit amongst in my room. Obviously no art gets made, one of the only things to have ever brought me joy. No improvements are made, no therapist seen, no meditation, no exercise...

I have dreams. This July I turn 25 and I am absolutely. fucking. terrified. There was so much I wanted to have accomplished by now. So many projects I've started that are sitting unfinished. So many skills I wanted to have by now. So much I wanted to experience. I know it's not too late... but I am terrified of succumbing to covid. I am terrified that I've signed my death warrant by ruining my lungs and throat with smoking. I am terrified I'll never get to finish the stories I'm writing. I'm terrified my ideas will die with me... solidifying that they will only ever be ideas and never finished works.

So I'm quitting. Right now. And in the meantime I'll be crossing my fingers that my covid test is negative. Once I know that for sure, I can take a breath. But for now, y'all please keep me, my roommate, and her boyfriend in your thoughts. Any positive vibes are appreciated. Everyone please stay safe, wear a mask, and wash your hands. I will be updating as find out the results of our covid tests.

Also I know this turned into a rant, I'm sorry. I don't have anyone IRL I can talk to about any of this. But writing down my reasons and how unhappy I've been felt cathartic. Thanks for letting me share.

During that time (when I was dabbing), I really got into the glass water pipe market and ended up spending a pretty penny on this really cool-looking piece. I bought these really expensive accessories for it and in all honesty, I only dab oil that I know tastes good. As a side note, part of the reason I quit was that I just don't have access to good quality oil anymore. I could go up to a dispensary every couple of weeks and drain my bank account like I was doing for a couple of months before I quit, but that is just completely unsustainable long term.

Anyway, back to the glass pipe: I know the thing that I should do is sell it, so that I'm never tempting myself to use it. I would probably even be able to make some $ off of it, as it's very unique, and the artists work is sought after because the design is rare. I was just so ecstatic when I bought it, and it's honestly a great piece of art in my opinion, but I know it's at least somewhat irresponsible to want to keep it, when there is much bigger and more important priority of mine to never smoke again, because I am an addict. If or when I smoke this thing, I will be right back to where I started, dabbing multiple times a day. I don't like smoking otherwise. 

For me, my thought process was that if I only smoked once in a while, it becomes a different drug where I feel like I'm tripping and get anxious, just generally not enjoyable. But when I get my tolerance up to the right level, which for me was dabbing 4-5 times a day, I really enjoyed myself thoroughly every time (or maybe I just told myself that).

There are times where I can't help myself and I go into my video library in my phone and watch old videos of me smoking it just to hear the function of it.

I think part of the problem that I had with getting high was that I considered myself to be a very unique and sophisticated smoker. I kept everything pristine, even going so far as to clean my pipe with rubbing alcohol after every dab (insanely obsessive of me) and rigorously scrubbing my nail with q-tips dipped in isopropyl alcohol (also wildly excessive). I would spend like 15-20 minutes just cleaning after every dab, but I actually found it to be relaxing for me (or maybe I diluted myself into thinking that because it felt validating to know that I'm consistent about my process, because I'm generally not a consistent person in life). Anyway, my friends would always comment how nice I kept my stuff and how I always have the best oil, and it kind of gave me an identity. I don't want this identity anymore because there's literally nothing else to it. Just being good at dabbing. Wow. Cool.

It truly felt cool when I would receive compliments about how a lot of people would say they never met someone who smokes like me. It made me feel unique.

I play guitar decently and sing well, but I never feel half as unique and interesting when it comes to my music. This post is very much all over the place, but bottom line I think I know the answer already, but wondering anybody else's thoughts about me potentially keeping this glass piece, or selling it. It's a really difficult decision for me for some reason even though I'm leaning towards selling it.

For the past 6 years of my life, quite gradually I had succumbed to weed, without even realizing the severity of it, until it became what felt like, permanent. I had become the worst version of myself. I went from a happy, motivated person, to someone whose pleasures were stripped away, in replacement this simple need to just smoke, eat, watch movies, repeat. And when you are in it, you don't see how you are wasting time. You make excuses for it, it can be an escape for you, it just feels good... you love it. Weed gave me a load of issues, from a trigger of intense anxiety, depression, bitterness, paranoia, that did not go away, even when I was sober. My days blended together, and I was stuck in a cycle that I could not get out of. Yes, I would quit at times, but to be honest I always knew I would go back.

I am here to tell you that, if you are in a situation where you can't imagine you can ever stop, and feel hopeless, please believe I was the same way. I wholeheartedly believed this would be in my life forever and I could not imagine a day where I would not throw away my last stash, and not hurriedly convince myself to have just one more and go out again to buy another. I have not smoked in months, and have not even obsessed over it or felt tempted. Why? 

**Don't let yourself hit rock bottom in order to change.** 

For me, I was just sick of being in a cycle. I started to feel guilty and shameful to the point that I did not even enjoy it during. But what especially snapped me out of it, was this realization that I am now 23 years old, and I could EASILY do this for another 3 years. When you are not sober, you don't even realize how much of the same is happening, and how much of it you are wasting, for what? Honestly, for what? And most of all, you just don't realize, how blessed you are to just be able to... do anything. You are breathing, right now. Go live. Before and after I stopped smoking, a lot of bad stuff has happened to me. I have a lot of health issues (and I could easily smoke to cope with that), but instead, I am choosing to fix those problems and then, never again take for granted how lucky I was to be able to do anything I want with my day. And never again waste it. I can't express to you, stranger, the emotions I am feeling, because a few short years ago, I was a little younger and felt like it was me against the world. I hugged myself and gave myself all the excuses to enjoy smoking away, and dealing with it tomorrow. Well, guess what. It's you vs you.

Just take a moment to appreciate what you have. Take a moment to appreciate how old you are, how life is short, and how at this moment, you need take your life by your own hands and do something with it. We are not meant to be here to just smoke the days away. I finally see it fully, and feel that. I finally have no care to smoke because I have a load of other things I want to just get to. I have a life I want to live. And I have things to be grateful for already, even with all the terrible stuff that is currently happening to me.

I’m a 25 year old male from the UK and this is my first post on Reddit, ever. Im currently on 2 day of not smoking weed. Other than going on holidays, or a 2 week self imposed ban for money purposes, I’ve smoked weed every day for the last 6 years but have smoked from a much younger age.

I tried my first joint when I was in secondary school, which in the UK is from age 12-16. I must have been around 14/15?

My daily smoking habit probably didn’t start until I went to university at around age 19 because I moved out of the family home and had the freedom to do what I wanted.

My mum and step father were heavy weed smokers and I actually used to sneak into my mums room and take her joints from her tin as she didn’t smoke them all the way down.

The reason I’m posting this is because I want some opinions. I would consider myself to be a fully functioning stoner. I normally tend to only smoke one joint in the evening (unless it is a weekend or I have nothing to do on that day). I have a good job which pays well, I workout daily (football, martial arts, weights), I have a wide social circle and dont really consider myself to have any depression or anxiety. 

Generally, I view weed positively. I love the relaxing benefits that it brings, I enjoy being stoned and eating food (but also love eating when not stoned), I enjoy watching movies stoned or playing games stoned. I can party stoned and socialise stoned (but also do both without being high). 

I don’t really want to quit to be honest. 

However, I’m going to try. I’m going to try because I know that I don’t want to quit.

Sometimes I think I use weed as an emotional crutch. I’m pretty relaxed generally and very rarely worry about things but I think it’s because I smoke. I feel angry? Smoke. I feel sad? Smoke. I’m happy? Smoke. This can’t be good.

When I was in my early twenties I always used to worry about my weed consumption. I felt like it might be holding me back and making me stupid or whatever. As I got older, I stopped worrying about it because I found I was beating myself up about it a lot and this would piss me off so I just accepted that I like to smoke. Snoop dogg, big narstie, so many high functioning stoners with successful lives out there.

Ultimately, what I would like an opinion on is: am I addicted if I choose to smoke everyday because I like to do so and don’t experience (as far as I’m aware) any negative side effects? I don’t feel stupid, sluggish, slow, paranoia, anxiety/depression. I don’t smoke all day, if I’ve got shit to do I do it. I’ve kept progressing forward in all aspects of life (as far as I’m aware) the entire time I’ve been a smoker.

I’m quitting because an ex said I should. She kissed someone early doors and I worried about it later down the line. She said my worry was paranoia but who knows, she doesn’t smoke so of course she would say that. Not me. Hence thought I’d respect her wishes and try.

Any thoughts or personal opinions welcome!

Peace x

I've done reasonably well in life so far. Moved to the US from India on educational merit, attended a good school, do innovative work in Bay Area and get a good salary for it. I was smoking weed through all of it. I believe I am a highly functional addict. I've always felt that smoking weed has made me a better person. More calm, reflective, focus on self care rather than only on my responsibilities. So it has always been hard to rationalize why I want to quit smoking weed. It's made me who I am and I like who I am. 

At 32 years old, I am realizing that this habit is also holding me back from becoming the best version of myself. The innate desire to do something is gone. In both personal and work life. I don't have any goals in life and more than happy to keep cruising along. I want to learn new skills. Become better at my hobbies and work. Another big problem that I see with regular weed use is that the only way I can enjoy something is if I am high and I don't think it is a good thing. 


I am also concerned about the physical side effects of my weed addiction. 13 years of semi-regular use has to have caused some physical damage to the body. We are planning on having a baby this year and I don't think it is right for me to continue this habit in this next chapter of my life. I want to be mentally present, active and physically healthy for what comes next.

Title may be misleading. I'm not going to advertise meds to quit weed, since such things don't really exist.Long time user, long time lurker, wish I had posted this before. This is infact my first post on Reddit ever. This is gonna be a long post, because I owe you parts of my reflections.English is not my first language so be careful while trying to understand my point.

""I'm a soon-to-be traitor"" it told me the first few times I smoked. Definitely should have listened.We all know how it feels to be trapped in the haze of good buds and chilling nights.We all know how it is to suddenly stop a mandatory routine. I'm not here to repeat those sentences.

I suffer from a psychiatric condition: bipolar disorder. Not really the toughest version of it, but it's deep shit to live with it anyways. I'm no especial person, because the truth is we all have lived in discomfort in our lives. Addiction is discomfort, sometimes also viceversa. And we all have been blind enough not to see how wrongly we were coping.

People told me to quit, without proper reasons, just because I must quit. You told me, instead, that quitting was possible. So

Dec 18, 2021 was my last joint.Dec 24, 2021 started a compelling suicidal thought pattern.Dec 26, 2021 I called my psychiatrist - God bless that woman - to confess that I hid my addiction and that I abruptly stopped it tossing away my entire stash.She replied ""Good boy, let me guess you're entering now into the manic stage"".That is - fuck my brain - what happened to me.I don't even know enough english vocabulary: extreme anxiety, restlesness, total insomnia, urge to speak bullshit, displays of euphoria. You know... the whole Kanye West thing lol.

Dec 31, 2021 I don't give a fuck it's New Year's Eve, I won't smoke. It was actually difficult but I did not indeed.

What I did realize - fuck my brain again - is that not only weed had kept me depressed and made my life like a worm's one, but it did interfere with my therapy. How can you complain with your doctors that your life sucks while you're the one responsible for all of that.

This is why now, **day 15**, I have no craving whatsoever (also I'm not Kanye anymore).Because I realized that my medications will keep me stable and functional as long as I don't smoke the goddamn shit. Hence the title of the post.

I'm so purposeful to not smoke ever again and read a book at night instead.I'm so grateful to have found this subreddit.I'm so ready to get my life back at 28 years old.

Sorry again for my english but I think I made myself clear. Clear and Clean.

The previous times I've quit I would feel positive effects by now, but now that's not really the case.
I'm just feeling sick and tired all the time, kind of feels like I didn't quit yet but without the escape of smoking.

Next week will be really hellish I think since it will be really busy at work and I only feel like I'm running on 5% capacity, instead of the 60% capacity while I was still smoking, or the 80-90% capacity I experienced by now in my previous quits.

All I can think about now is that quitting will have negative effects on my job in the short term, which may lead to negative effects on my life in the long run..

Like I said, not at all planning on smoking again but I sure hope that I won't fuck things up in the coming week. It was much easier the past week since I had my Christmas holidays and didn't have to work.

I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder. I also like(d) to smoke a lot of weed. Turns out weed was just putting me into a manic state followed by irritability and depression. My wife has a medical card and I don't want to hold her back obviously. I just can't help but get pissed off if I catch her smoking. I also keep cracking and sneaking weed.

I'm basically self medicating as I can't stop when I get going. I get the racing thoughts and tons of energy. Super annoying to other smokers in with. 

Anyways I already slipped up yesterday but today I'm posting here as I want to sneak into her stash right now. I don't have a lot of non smoking friends. They all support me but it is super hard for me to be around people smoking.

2022-01-02 14:25:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ruh5if/my_first_week_sober_after_15_years_of_daily_use_i/,My first week sober after 15 years of daily use- I can't believe I did it! (positive changes listed in post!),"This sub has absolutely been a godsend! Today is day 8 of complete sobriety for me. I never thought I'd make it, but now I know I never want to go back. Here are a few of the positive side effects I have noticed over the first week in my quitting journey:

&#x200B;

* heart beat is far more stable. No weird palpitations anymore!
* sinuses feel far more clear. After each smoke session, my nose would become clogged- I have no problems breathing this week
* headaches aren't constant. I've felt like I've had a headache everyday of my life. Now I can easily pinpoint where they're coming from when they do arise (which is far more seldom) 
* Bowel movements are better??? I know that's gross, but I usually take like 4 ""iffy"" (lol) poops in the morning- this week has been TOTALLY different. Solid, once-a-day poops. I really was NOT expecting that??
* dreams are kind of pleasant. I had one nightmare this week, but otherwise, my dreams are coming back in an appealing way!
* sleep has been WAY different. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel more restful? Like when I am tired, I am TIRED. I don't have to force myself to sleep with pot anymore. The sleepiness just hits me and I actually WANT to go to sleep instead of forcing myself by being too stoned to stay awake.
* Meditation is totally different. My mind doesn't wander nearly as much. I actually FEEL like I'm meditating instead of just sitting lotus and waiting for time to pass so I can ""be done"" with it.
* Racing thoughts are gone. Especially at night. Sure I still feel anxious from time to time, but it's not a constant barrage of thoughts that I can't hold onto for more than a millisecond. (this helps both meditation and sleep!) I never realized how being stoned made it impossible to notice my thoughts, but being sober allows me to focus x100 more, which slows down the thought-train to a manageable speed!
* I feel *here*. I went on a walk in the park the other day, and I was blown away by how beautiful the clouds and sunset were. Sure, I noticed beauty when stoned, and it's hard to articulate the difference- but I felt like I was appreciating the REAL world, instead of the world that I created high-off-my-butt. I didn't need a drug to enjoy it. I felt in my body, in my mind- not floating around stoned and distracted.

There are some downsides, but I wanted to focus on the positive for now. It's really incredible and I'm so proud of myself for making this change. I finally feel like I can get to know myself now, after half my life spent stoned and detached. I feel like I'm ready for anything!

I know it's really hard the first week, and maybe it's so easy for me to notice the positives because I spent literally 15 years (I'm almost 30) smoking EVERY SINGLE DAY, so it's almost like I've been given a brand new life. I can clearly see the positives because they're brand new to me. My only reference in life is being stoned. I really love being sober so much more. If you've read this far, thank you!

I never really understood why people loved weed. It made me anxious, my muscles twitch, and I just wanted it to be over.

But then I decided I wanted to give it a better chance. I knew it could help with anxiety and depression. I am a very high-strung and excitable person and it's an exhausting way to live. I am always in a rush. I made the choice to vape regularly. I quickly got used to it and the high changed, making the world fuzzy. For the first time in my life, time slowed down.

Around the same time, I started therapy to deal with past issues. I got a medical marijuana card. I also started a prescription medication for depression. We found out later that I am actually manic depressive so the medicine actually make the highs and lows more erratic. I was hypomanic that whole summer and weed put me in a place of extreme pleasure and peace. I felt like a child again. I would dance for no reason, do yoga to become more in tune to my body, and wrote in my journal.  I also started doing crazy things like scrub my bathroom walls at 2 am and spending waaay too much money on in-game purchases on phone games putting myself about $1000 in debt.. But even now I would say that it was the best summer of my life.

When autumn and winter hit, my mood crashed. I started vaping heavily. I could go through a cartridge in a week. I spent ridiculously large amount of money on cartridges. At one point, I went through 4 cartridges in a two week period.

Of course, it was waaaay too much. My other medications were not working correctly either. I got an insane panic attack that lasted for DAYS. I missed work because I thought I was dying. I went to my parents' house every day because I was so scared. My therapist put me on a perscription medicine to calm me down, but it barely scratched the surface.

Where was my doctor in all of this? She didn't know how much I was using because I never told her.

Did I stop after that panic attack? No. I stopped for 2 weeks and then started again. I was dangerous and irresponsible.  I vaped on the way to work. I was perpetually high for more than two years. I loved to wake and bake on my deck, fussing over my plants at 5 am in the morning, waking with the sun. I don't remember much of anything from those two years except that I spent a lot of time cleaning because it was soothing. There are many movies and tv shows I have to rewatch because I could not follow them at the time and even quality time with my spouse was overshadowed by my not being 100% there. I was a little high during my wedding reception.

I had a really high stress job during this time which made it worse.. I was in a constant state of anxiety. I felt out of control. My spouse didn't even know how much I was vaping because I would blow it out the window. By then, I don't think it was doing anything for me but I didn't want to stop. Before Covid lock down, I loaded myself with cartridges so I wouldn't have to leave the house to buy more ""medicine.""

Then we decided to have a baby. A little over a month before we started trying, i vaped and smoked the last of my stash. Within 2 days, I was scraping the bottom of my grinder for ""one last hurrah."" It ended up being one last anxiety session mixed with guilt and shame that I did it.

I have since stopped. I became pregnant after our first try. I have been clean for more than a year now. I let my medical marijuana license expire. I won't go back - I know too well that I have that addictive personality. I also can't imagine not being ""there"" for my daughter, who grows so fast every day.

I have respect for marijuana because I know it helps a lot of people. But it made my life hell. I won't go back.

So as the title says from iv been smoking 15 years old to the presant day, 30 years old. I wouldn't class myself as a real heavy smoker at all, but I think the time smoking without any brakes has caused a real issue that I have only begun to understand and see clearly. Most things I do revolve around weed, Well nearly all Except work. I walk the dog I smoke, I go to the gym I must smoke directly before, watch TV, go a drive, meet friends etc etc. Last night was my first night in as long as I can remember going to sleep without smoking some weed, I did get some sleep though I had some beers that may have helped. I believe weed has held me back in life as much as I enjoy it I think I could have achieved so much more, socially, reaching goals, motivation etc. I guess when you smoke and feel normal that's a problem. I'm like that now, I feel it wakes me up first smoke of the day gives me energy (before the tired/foggyness the remainder of the day) I never feel rested due to no REM sleep and no dreaming for as long as I can remember. Long story short I'm most content when I'm on my own high just doing nothing, which clearly isn't healthy. I'm worried about a number of things, sleep, enjoying activitys, weight training without weed as I have tryed and it just doesn't happin. This is day number 2 without weed, it acctually hasn't been bad but I'm sure the next coming days/weeks/months may be rough. So really I'm looking advice on how to battle my way out of this, what to expect from others who have been though this. I am Sick of feeling dull emotions, tired and groggy constantly but yet I just kept smoking.

Let's identify them, so we know to let them go instead of acting on them and relapsing. Dont worry if it's too hard to talk about though.","Hi, I'm on day 2 of quitting and night is decending, so I know its going to get tougher now, going to run a hot bath. The thing I'm struggling with most to quit is triggers that make me want to smoke, mostly because of self hatred. Weed is my form of self harm, as I know it makes me feel sick and horrible and ashamed. My biggest trigger is my loneliness, just reading on here about how people have their partner, friends and family supporting them triggers me to smoke. I went out walking today and saw a couple kissing and that triggered me to smoke as it reminded me I'm an unlovable piece of crap that does not deserve love. It's not true of course, we do deserve love. 

Ironically, if weed hadn't been my number 1 love affair and best friend rolled into one for 10 years, maybe I would have more people in my life. I remember that when triggered, its this shit that has robbed you of human connection for years anyway. It's this shit why you pushed  everyone away and became lame to be around. This is why facing sobriety can be hard, you're facing the mess you've made of things and what you've lost being high all the time. 

We can do it though, the key is knowing that you deserve to be better. You deserve to not feel like crap all the time. You deserve a good life. You deserve the chance to leave your past behind, instead of wallowing in it, like weed makes you do. You deserve to have another chance at life, a chance to do better and make better decisions. A chance to repair the pain from your past, you will never do this while baked all the time, you will not fully heal, and that's what most of us here need, to heal our body and mind.

You are not what happened to you. You are not those shitty things you've done. Today you are who you choose to be, and you've already learnt from those mistakes, a new day is dawning, for all of us, that's why we are here, and that first step, that makes you a legend.

Is it because I'm not sleeping much that I'm not getting dreams or night sweats? I also think I might have had CHS as my appetite has actually improved and I have little to no nausea compared to when I was smoking. 

Just curious of the withdrawal timeline in the first week, I was a daily smoker for 10 years. Is it gonna hit me like a truck in the next few days or have I gotten past the worst of it?

First off, this page has been a huge help. Thank you. 
It's time for me to quit. 

For the past 2 months I've been consuming at least one 250mg tincture every day. If I don't drink that, I'll consume a gram (740mg THC) of RSO. Sometimes that'll last for a week. 

I want to quit, but with this much THC in my body, I'm afraid it would cause alot of I'll effects. I'd like to ween myself down with 1:1s and getting smaller, however I wind up going back up in THC content. I'll even tell my brain that we should be going down, but then I get the (fuck it) impulse and go higher.

Not until I found this subreddit, and was met with love, and compassion. So much understanding here that I managed to absolutely weep on more than one occasion because it felt like finally, I found folk who understand how bad it can get. As I was told, the first few days were hell, and they will be. For me, by day 7, I was able to enjoy food, and it was my first day without crying more than once. It was like seeing the promised land, even if just in the distance. Using was still on my mind... but it didnt feel so physical anymore. It felt like something I now had the willpower to keep away from. 

Now, thats not to say I didnt fuck up once or twice through moments of weakness when it was in front of me, but it does mean that I had the absility and power to pick myself off the ground after I came back to my senses, and realized where my priorities were, and start back up, day 1, part 2 :electric boogaloo. I ended up fucking up a second time not too far from the first time, but it was different this time. Because it wasnt consistently in my syystem, I still managed to have some clarity to see what it turned me into while it was in me. I was slow, forgetful, borderline useless, and I did not like that. I swore it off for good, no matter what, after that. Each day got easier with this newfound awareness, and understanding of what my true needs are, and where my priorities lie. 

I almost lost my girlfriend with how much it controlled my life, but I am happy to say I pulled through, and I am healthier than I have ever been, ajd it is mostly because of you all, here, in this subreddit.

My desire to quit has always been there, but it never fully consumed me. I would take a few days off (at most), then fall back into the never-ending cycle of smoking my brain to death. I was ok with floating around in that all too familiar haze, just sitting on the couch and mindlessly watching my favorite YouTube videos. Trust me, I know what you guys are going through. 

I'm on day 22 without weed now, and I am determined to keep this count going. FOREVER. Although I am relatively early in the quitting process, I wanted to share the key my key to quitting, and why it's a bit different for me this time. 

In order to quit weed, or anything else for that matter, you need to WANT IT. There has to be a fire within your soul to abstain from your negative lifestyle. You need to view the process of quitting weed as separating from a dark and evil presence in your life. The only way to defeat weed is to ATTACK IT. Merely wanting to quit does nothing to help you quit. The fire inside is the only way forward. Perhaps others can agree with me here. 

For me, my fire was ignited by my breakup with my ex. My weed habits completely destroyed my relationship with a person that I deeply cared for, and I realized that I can't continue down this dark path of isolation and pain any longer. 

This raging fire within to improve becomes your primary ally in your journey. With each day off of weed, you gain just a little bit of that old self that you miss so much. It's hard as hell in the beginning, we all know that. But as this cancerous phase passes, you begin to separate from your stoner, lazy self, and it is the most liberating feeling. You start to notice how much different you have become from your group of stoner friends. You become to feel proud of yourself for how much inner strength you have. Life becomes better, and you finally realize that weed has become a liability to you. Your inner fire to quit only grows stronger with time. 

Have faith, and I know it's not easy. It never is. You got this. Good luck with your journey towards the light.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43749422}"

It’s been over a decade of daily use and I just don’t see what benefits it’s bringing to my life anymore. I want to see what I can accomplish without my dependency on weed. My SO and I are also getting close to starting a family.  I feel like if I can’t give up weed, even for a few weeks, then I have no business having a baby yet.

I feel oddly invigorated by my decision but equally as anxious. Today I feel brave, but I know tomorrow morning I will wake up with my mind trying to trick me into buying more weed.

I’m a 23 year old male from Denmark. I want to share my experience and hopefully inspire some of you. 

So about my weed addiction. I started smoking when i was 16 years old and i’ve been an addict since i was 18 years old. I’ve been smoking almost daily for 5 years until 2 months ago when i had an experience that changed my life. So first a little backstory. This summer me and my girlfriend for 7 years broke up. It was a very hard breakup which left me in a deep depression. I was smoking everyday since the break up. Then something happened that changed my life.

The 11th of October i was at football practice when i took a very hard hit to the head which gave me a concussion. At the time i didn’t know i had a concussion so i continued playing. After practice i did the usual deed and went home to smoke.
When i woke up the next morning my depression had gotten severly worse. I continued smoking for a week after this and my depression gradually worsened everyday. I smoked my last joint the 24th of October and at this point my depression had gotten so bad that i couldn’t feel any emotions at all. I was numb. I slowly started losing my sanity and it developed to a psycotic state where i was certain i had gotten brain damage. Turns out smoking weed everyday after having a concussion takes it toll on the brain and mine basically shut off. 

I moved home to my parents, confessed my addiction and started psyciatric treament.
For 2 months i was psycotic and i was certain i was going to die and was reliving my whole life in my head. All i could think of was how much i regretted wasting so much time smoking weed. I never got to live my life cus i wasted it. Trust me guys you don’t want to look back on your life not remebering anything cus you been stoned all the time wasting your potential. Reach out to someone. Seek help. Admit to yourself you have a problem and fix it before it’s too late. You got this <3

I’m now starting rehab. I never want to smoke another joint in my life again. Not in a couple months when i feel like i can control it. Not in a few years. Never again. I’m so much better without it. I want to make myself, my family and my friends proud and i want to cut ties with the people i only have weed in common with.

For the last 8 years I have smoked every day with 3 notable periods of tolerance breaks the longest being 76 days last year. In the last 4 years this is usually around 2 personal
Joints only in the evenings as I do it enjoy smoking in the day. Around 1-2g per day. All previous attempts to quit have been far easier than I had imagine in the run up to actually stopping. I usually try to time when I stop with going on holiday / somewhere where weed is less accessible. This latest time by far and above the withdrawals have been incomparable. Over the last 10 nights I haven’t managed to fall asleep without a minimum of 3 hours lying there once. The anxiety has reduced to around 70% in the last 3 days or so but still is hugely noticeable around going to bed. I am flying back to the U.K. tomorrow and plan to continue quitting. Hoping the mixture of a more familiar environment and no longer sleeping alone (I live with my gf who is a heavy smoker) will ask the insomnia. Main concern is I am back to work soon and I simply cannot get by on 3 hours sleep per night. Any ideas on what to do to help aid falling asleep quicker and more interestingly how long the insomnia / sleep anxiety lasted for yourself? TIA.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5018136}"

20 here, Started 2021 broke, selling drugs with my bum “friends”working myself to death and blowing every paycheck on weed & food. My relationship was on the line with my GF & family and I had spent the last year, which was my gap year doing all of the above. 

It is 01/01/2022 and I am nothing like the person I was 1 year ago, I quit 03/26/2021 cold turkey on a 2 week family vacation and haven’t looked back. 

I cut everyone out of my life besides my GF & family and discovered I’m actually an introvert, it was just masked by weed. I seldom drink and never smoke. 

Anyhow, I turned 20 the 18th of December, decided to have a couple of those old friends over in hopes they changed, sadly I was right, I hoped they changed but knew they likely haven’t and the didn’t. It was honestly a mix of resentment because I know they could do better, disappointment because I used to kick it with them all day everyday and called them “brothers” and disgust, it was like a mirror reflection of myself a year ago. One of them was fiending for weed off the other, and they were both talking about the drugs they’ve done and just general failure, still unemployed as well. 

Anyhow, I think my relationship has changed with weed, for the better. It’s not a “I can’t smoke this otherwise I’m going to get hooked” it’s a “I don’t want to smoke this because I don’t see any benefits” I hit a blunt one time last night, and while yeah I felt a little “loopy” and “high” it wasn’t enjoyable. I have so many other hobbies now like music, working on my cars, making money at my dealership that weed just feels unnecessary and hindering. Last night reinforced that, and also gave me some hindsight as to why I smoked so heavily. Merely to escape the after affects of consuming it, the dissatisfaction, disassociation, brain fog & depression. 

I’ve also had some introspective thoughts on the societal side of it. 

Take alcohol for example, moderation is okay, a drink here and there. If you drink every day multiple times a day, you have a problem and are labeled an alcoholic and an addict by society. 

If usage could be moderated it wouldn’t be a problem, but in reality it can’t be, addressed below. 

the way society views it is different. It’s “okay” or accepted to smoke everyday, more people are jumping onboard with it and supporting it (I think partially due to the money they see to be made) to the point, everyday is normal, that’s “moderation” now

The reason being? 
Smoking weed doesn’t kill others, it doesn’t cause you to get into physical alterations merely due to intoxication, it only kills you; mentally. Very slowly and it’s an almost unnoticeable, slow and painful, steady decline until you’re at rock bottom wondering how the hell you got there to begin with. 
You don’t kill innocent people in accidents, you don’t assault your SO or destroy your liver. 

The public opinion has changed drastically on it, “they” don’t care if you waste your life away chasing a high that will always end, it is not a problem until it kills/harms others. That’s my take on it, I’m sober and glad. Just food for thought",10,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5363607}"

1: the most important one is HONESTY. You wont be able to quit and find long lasting motivation if you arent being honest with yourself. Personally, opening with my friends and family about my usage has really made it easier and you wont feel as alone going through this.

- Filling up your days in advance with activities (gym/friends/exercise etc)
- Getting yourself out of bed early and establishing a healthy routine of not going back in it until its time to sleep again
- Keep finding motivation to continue (I remind myself of why I wanted to quit in the first place)
- Try to approach this journey with a monetary perspective and enjoy the savings you’ve made not smoking 

Bit of context on me if you’re interested:
I was heavily addicted for the past 3 years to THC (and my brain still is which is why the idea of going back eventually doesnt work). Lately I would wake up around 3-4am everyday and take at least 5 blinkers of 510 carts and would continue to hit it throughout the day. Decided to quit when I realized I was barely getting high anymore. My addiction got even worse after the first quanrantine with basically no breaks in my usage. I would spend around 200$ a month on various smoking expenses. 

Appreciate anyone reading this and remember sobriety can be easy to reach if you give yourself the right tools. Essentially you just have to not smoke (Ik, so smart) so dont let some into your lungs and you’ll get there quicker than you think. Try to remember how you were at the lowest point in your addiction and build from there! ✌🏼",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46605325}"

I had smoked non stop every day, multiple times a day since my graduation in March 2020. Towards the end moved towards concentrates, at one point was smoking every 30-45 minutes.

The days after are pretty lackluster as well. Brain fog, dissatisfaction & disassociation. I wouldn’t say I’m disappointed in myself that I did it, as I still have no desire to smoke it and honestly it reinforced that for me, also opened my eyes as to why it became so heavy used, I was merely escaping sobriety whereas now I enjoy it and like being level headed/sober. just somewhat of a reminder for the people who’ve quit and thought about trying it again.

I've been smoking for about 6 years, pretty much daily for the last 3. Obviously not a really long-term smoker but I think it's safe to say I am an addict.

I'm sick of the apathy, lying to friends and family to sneak off for another joint, and numbing the emotions that I desperately need to face.

I have asked him to not pass me anything and explained to him that I'm done with it and he's supportive. I've also told him that this is my decision and he shouldn't feel he needs to change his behaviours (where he smokes etc.) on my account - it's still his home too and we have a lot of fun together, I just don't want to partake in the smoking anymore. Smelling it in the flat is going to be a nightmare and I am scared I'm going to crumble.

I'm headed back home tomorrow for what I expect to be a difficult day 2... But hey, day 1 has gone pretty smoothly and I feel good for writing this out. Cheers for reading, and good luck to everyone on their journey to being weedless. Peace",13,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38457093}"

My mental health was horrid at the time, and it quickly went from ""Only weekends/only for sleep"" to all the time. It helped me eat, sleep, feel less anxious... and I got to where i felt like I NEEDED it to get through my day.
I've done so much work mental health wise that I'm at a good place where I feel confident in my ability to be able to manage my stress/MH in healthier ways with better coping skills.
I think smoking helped a LOT with some of my problems, but it also destroyed my motivation to do things. Like the one south Park episode said ""Weed doesn't change who you are, it just makes you okay with doing nothing"".
 I haven't smoked since the ball dropped (not impressive I know) but I want to see how long I can make it!! I'd like to hear other people's experiences with smoking, quitting, and how it felt mentally for you.",9,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.43016553}"

* If possible, I didn't attempt to do anything too complicated or frustrating. I was quick to get short tempered and want to run back to weed for comfort.
* Watch familiar and lighthearted tv shows or movies (for example sitcom reruns, bloopers, comedy movies, etc) If what I was watching was too challenging or complicated, it might peak anxious feelings and make me want to use weed to cope.
* Avoid too much random internet and social media. My brain will spin and I will feel exhausted from the dopamine rushes. Look into social media addiction. Check out subreddits for internet and social media addiction
* Find something easygoing to do like coloring, sketching, whittling, cleaning a room, organizing, guitar, etc. Creating something helps release dopamine in a healthy way. Little wins help a lot.
* Have some easy foods ready like after a sickness or surgery. Yogurt, jello, buttered noodles, saltines, mashed potatoes, rice, etc. Have some antacids handy too.
* Stay hydrated.  Some drinks are made to aid hydration and can be a nice compliment to water.  Sparkling water can be very refreshing and help break up unusual throat feelings that come with quitting.
* I got stress and tension headaches.  Be ready with some headache meds. Yoga for headaches can be found on YouTube. Fresh air can help too.
* I went on very on long walks or bike rides with a podcast. It eased anxiety and help wear the body down for better rest at night. It also counts as exercise if the idea of the gym or running seems like too much. 
* Listen to interesting podcasts or ebooks. They will distract and help keep the circling thoughts at bay. Combine this with a long walk or bike ride.
* Yoga/stretching. Check YouTube for yoga for anxiety, stress, and tension
* Don't be too hard on myself for losing patience and temper. Just try and catch it before hurting friends and family. Journaling about when these things happen can help find patterns and give you more control
* Expect intense, exhausting, and confusing dreams. Seriously disturbing stuff based on your deepest worries, fears, and secrets. I have experienced these many months into my quits
* Try not to make any big dramatic decisions (breaking up, quitting jobs, buying cars, etc) until the dust settles on the quit. Sleep on any big decisions changes if possible until a few weeks or months after quitting.
* When I started thinking of a bunch of overwhelming stuff I need to do, just put it all in a list.  This avoids worrying about all of it in a circular pattern. Look into the Getting Things Done concept and strategies. The mind is great at thinking of things, but not so great with storage and recall.
* Expect anxiety attacks and don't give them too much power.  It's just the addiction monkey thrashing as you hold it's head under the water.  Anxiety attacks should start to settle a month or so in. But then again, sometimes they come from real problems I need to face with a sober reality. Those problems will not fix themselves by quitting weed, so this anxiety could be around for a while
* Be prepared for sleep issues.  For me it's waking up way too early.  A few weeks in, my sleep was much improved and I feel i am getting better rest than I have in years.  But sometimes I still wake up way too early. But hey, bright side that's more time in the day.
* Some people get a lot of night sweats.  If possible keep the bedroom really cool and run a dehumidifier to keep the air dry.",14,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.51776373}"

The only people who know are my husband, and some of my very close direct family members. No friends know. My husband's side of the family have no idea. I am so ashamed that I will be judged as a terrible mother. I am 27, have an almost 2 year old, and am pregnant again (I know...I know...please do not judge me....I am GOING TO QUIT. YESTERDAY WAS THE LAST DAY). 

Before I became a mother, when I wasn't working, I would isolate myself and just get high all day. When I became a mother, I obviously couldn't do that as I have a child to care for, so my habit became to smoke weed every night after my baby went to sleep. 

For me, I feel like weed has really isolated me. (I feel like it has also made me paranoid...I don't like having people over to our lovely home because I get scared they may smell weed somewhere, even though it's kept outside in a hiding spot no one could find). I don't identify as a ""ganja mom"" or anything like that. I am a prude, and I never thought I would end up being addicted to weed like I am. I hate the fact that I rely on weed to calm down and relax and unwind. 

My husband has a very successful and prosperous career, and our family is upper-middle class. I feel completely alone and like no other mom that's like me smokes weed. Alcohol? Sure, everyone has some wine every night, but weed? No way. Unless other people are hiding it too, but who knows. 

Anyways, I am just looking for some nice comments with maybe people's experiences of how you were like me and quit.

2022-01-01 12:36:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rto3if/day_40_anxiety_and_insomnia_getting_better/,Day 40 - Anxiety and Insomnia getting better,"I smoked pretty much everyday for 7 years, with 5 or so serious attempts to quit. In the first few years quitting was easier and I even made it 3 months once. But the last few years saw me smoking no less than 7 joints a day. Any attempts to quit in the past couple years didn’t last longer than 2-3 weeks because I couldn’t get through the withdrawals, specifically insomnia and anxiety. I lost all hope of quitting because of reading online that the withdrawal wasn’t real and I was just returning to my “mentally ill” true state that THC was helping. 

My wife left me over a year ago because I ruined our marriage with my addiction and truly believed I could never quit. I smoked 1/8-1/4 everyday since she left until November 2021. Immediately the insomnia started and the physical symptoms of anxiety were so intense I don’t even want to describe it. My dream, post-divorce, has been to work in Japan if/when their border ever reopens and I realized I could never do that unless I quit weed. I knew the withdrawal would be too brutal to experience alone overseas. 

I’ve tried M.A. many times but this time I prayed and cried and begged on my knees to be released from addiction. I’m not religious or spiritual and I don’t know why but I haven’t had a craving since that day. I’m not saying that’s why I’ve been able to quit this time… but I NEEDED a higher power belief to get me through this as I’m completely alone and isolated. I quit nicotine mints and coffee at the same time. 

Today is day 40, but I spent 2 weeks before that only having 1-4 puffs of a single joint for 2 weeks to try avoid the withdrawal. That helped for the feverish gross feeling and night anxiety and insomnia.. but a couple days after I quit cold turkey, I couldn’t sleep for more than 3-4 hours a night for 30 days or so. I’d wake up 3 to 4 times in that 4 hours too. My anxiety was the worst in my life. But I just kept telling myself I could do it and I wouldn’t die or lose my mind. Nothing under the sun helped except time. 

The past week my sleep is getting better. I’ve even managed a couple 8 hour sleeps even though I still wake up multiple times a night sweating and dreaming extremely vivid, intense dreams. My anxiety is so much more manageable now. I think In another 40 days I’ll feel better. My brain fog and short term memory are still really bad and it’s frustrating because I can’t do the things I want to do yet that I know will help give me a better life. 

My advice would be patience above all else. Trust your body will heal in time. It could take some people even longer to sleep better but don’t give up. I’m still in the middle of the battle but I can see a little light at the end of the tunnel. Also, don’t EVER believe anything you read that suggests you aren’t actually in withdrawal but rather experiencing your underlaying mental illness. Some of us just take a lot more time to return to equilibrium. If you have cravings, learn to “urge surf”.

This is my breakout year, where I will find my true self and harness my ambitions to achieve the life I want to live. 

This past year was a wild ride; though I learned, and grew, I did not achieve what I had hoped too at the beginning of the year. My vices still plagued me: weed, draining my confidence; porn, sucking the life out of me; and the judgements of others, molded my actions.

I was away for Christmas, and clean for a week, was feeling great and really motivated. I came back to my tiny studio apartment, found i had no running water, and went into an anxiety panic of just loneliness and woe is me…what will i do…also a hot shower is a great replacement to smoking for me…this is the second time in 2 weeks I bought weed then either threw it or gave it away…I am young enough that I’ve only been smoking for about 3 years habitually, and the quantity that I smoke isn’t outrageous…5g/10 days but I want so badly to stop. I have so much going for me, am in a challenging masters program in france…I can’t afford literally or metaphorically to spend another semester smoking away my loneliness instead of facing life.

Ive gotten rid of everything. The bong that served me well this last year is gone, the last of my weed is flushed. My buster, anything left all went in the dumpster. 

I feel dizzy. 

I worry about how I will do emotionally at work. I just started a new job working reception at a busy doctor's office. I really love it already. I never smoked before work, it was always an after work relaxing time. But it was every night, all night. 

I know, from reading, when going through the process of quitting a common thing to deal with is your emotions and sometimes struggling to contain them.

Had my last toke on the 28th and the clarity I’m already feeling after just 3 days is incredible. Like many of you, I’ve been trying to quit unsuccessfully for quite some time (since 2013 if I’m being honest) but none of us are getting any younger and life is just too damn short to waste any more time in the fog of weed. I’m ready to experience all the ups and downs life has to offer with a clear mind. This sub is a godsend for those seeking to kick the habit and I am thankful for every post that’s lifted and motivated me towards sobriety.

2022-01-01 03:28:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rtf4rv/video_games/,Video games,"Seeing other posts with similar topics (alcohol in particar) made me want to share this. I passed 1000 days the day before yesterday. Man, it has been tough. I’d like to say it was easy after the first month, but there are always and I think always will be cravings for me to pick up the phone and call whoever. I’m lucky to have a loving wife and family to support me, and without them I would certainly not be writing this.

What I’ve realised is unfortunately I am not drawn just to weed as a substance. Like many of us, I seek escape from reality and pursue this to binge. These last months I’ve really started noticing how much I’ve been playing. With work from home, a cushy job and somewhat lax other commitments I’ve sunk more and more time into being as unproductive to myself as I can. 

The sad part is that I don’t want to give up video games forever, nor I think I should. It’s just funny to me that your shadow or addiction or whatever side you want to call it is working just as hard, and sometimes harder, than you at staying on track. Maybe it’s the new years resolution posts, but I want to br back on track. I want to live to better myself much like I was when I first started quitting seriously about two and change years ago. 

That’s all. Wanted to share something that’s been on my mind and if you’re in the same boat as me let’s attack those big life goals in the new year.

I was as bad as anyone could get. Seriously. I had my “last day” about a hundred times, got high the next day a hundred times. Two years ago I ended that cycle. What was so seemingly impossible to do has now become not even a conscious effort. I don’t even think about it. I’ll probably never smoke again in my life. I don’t need to learn the lesson over and over that I can’t do it with moderation, and I just need to stop. I’ve learned that. Someone reading this probably has been questioning this too “well do I really need to quit entirely?” I just want to say that I am 100% a better human being not smoking weed and you can be too. I hope some of you will start tomorrow. I used to get so fucking baked. I’d spend 60$ and smoke it all in one night. I’d buy a 100mg edible and smoke an entire eighth in joints, binge eating shit food until I passed out in front of whatever I was watching. I struggled for many many many years trying to quit.
