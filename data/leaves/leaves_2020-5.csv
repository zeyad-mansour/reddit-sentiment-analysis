Afterwards I feel abdominal pain and just generally sick for a few hours until I try to eat again. I want to quit so bad but every time I try I get this same result and end up starving myself for a week until I start smoking again just so I can eat. Any advice or if you’ve had similar experience please let me know it’s getting unbearable.,2
2020-05-30 23:12:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gtrkhj/if_not_now_then_when/,"If not now, then when","There's never a right time to quit, life will always throw shit at you. So if not now, then when? I justify smoking everyday, every morning and every night.   
I wake up in the morning feel groggy and anxious and think, ""oh I don't have enough weed in my system, better have a cone"". Then before I leave the house, ""Well I want to be able to eat"" or ""I don't want to get the sweats when I'm out"". Then at night, ""I wouldn't be able to sleep without it, I'd better have the same amount of green as the night before so I won't sweat"". 

But IF NOT NOW, THEN WHEN 

Tomorrow? So you can have that one last good high? 

Or in a week? because you have a couple nugs left and couldn't possible throw them away.

Or in a month? Because you have an exam coming up and can't deal with the withdrawals and anxiety.

Or in a year? Suddenly you look back and realised its another year wasted. Another failed attempt at uni. Another failed attempt at a healthy routine. Another failed attempt at a new hobby.

Or right now, put the bong away and get out and go for that bike ride you've been thinking about for weeks but haven't had the energy for. Or read that book you'd been wanting to read for ages but could never remember what was going on in it. 

Change is ridiculously difficult. Our brains always choose the path of least resistance, the paths we have walked the most, further ingraining those behaviours and those bad habits. But I've got to start somewhere! because I am so god damn tired of thinking and behaving in two completely different ways. I think about all the things I want to do while I sit here smoking cones. This addiction is a form of control over me to stop me from doing what I actually want to do in life.   
Weed falsely makes me believe that I can explore worlds from my own mind, that I can learn all these fascinating things without ever stepping out of my room. Of course this is true on some level with the internet. But I opt for sitting alone in a dark room to explore ideas over actually exploring nature and society and making new friends and new experiences. By choosing to sit here I am allowing weed to make my choices for me.

So I'm going to start changing small things about my routine, something small that I can easily control, something to give me the satisfaction of achievement.

Its time for a change.",46

I've come to the realization slowly over the last year, that my continuous weed usage has got to stop.  Like many others, I've reached the point where I feel like it has nothing more to offer me.  I've tried to quit multiple times in the past after smoking for 8+ years.  The only time I managed to stop for a decent run, was when i was put on probation for 6 months. I just remember about 2 months in i felt such a level of clarity I hadn't felt in a long time! The feeling of control overy myself is anything I long for.

It was almost like a high in itself being so sober and clear headed. Like the fog had cleared. I'm really wanted to get back to that feeling.  I managed to cut it down to once or twice a week, but then the ""shelter in place"" order happened and that was that lol. 

My wife also loves to smoke and doesn't currently feel like she needs to stop or slow down herself, which is completely fine with me.  We have a great and loving relationship, this is just a personal issue i want to resolve for myself.  Realistically though, it makes it extremely challenging since I'm constantly around it.  

The other issue for me is that I don't want to continue to damage my lungs in this manner. I'm only 26 but I really want to focus on becoming the most in athletic I can be in the next 4 years and instill those healthy habits well into my 30s.

Lately I’ve been feeling like I want to get high, and it always seems to happen right near the 90 day mark. I’m starting to feel this restlessness again, and the warm weather is not helping. The warm weather is kind of triggering to be honest. I kind of miss being outdoors and listening to nature high; I felt like I had inner peace. 

I notice when there is too much calmness in my life, and too much routine I start to want to get high. 

I also feel like life’s problems are starting to resurface again. My body image issues, dating, my career, my sexuality; all of it is starting to resurface. I notice I’m starting to not stick to routine, and I know it’s one of the first signs that you’re relapsing before the relapse. How do you prevent the physical relapse from happening when the emotional one is starting to take place? 

I told myself that this time would be different, and I really don’t have it in me for  another relapse. The chaos on my mental health is too much.",4

2020-05-30 17:36:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gtmedx/story_of_mine_40_yr_old_after_15_years_of_smoking/,"Story of mine... 40 yr old, after 15 years of smoking","Well... the story of mine (so far). Probably my first post on Reddit, and the first time I'm writing about this, or talking per se.

40 year old guy here, no kids, no family (yet). I was smoking weed since... huh, maybe 15 years. A bit of background: I was born in a small Eastern-European country (so, sorry if I'm misusing phrases or anything, still mastering English), in a family of scholars. I was always a shy, introvert guy, had some childhood problems (sexual abuse by pedophiles, family troubles, etc), and I was always more into reading books than playing with other kids, learned coding from reverse engineering source codes of magazine CD's because we didn't have money to pay for internet, etc. I wasn't smoking in high school. Many of my classmates were, or taking LSD, mushroom, but in that time I was different and refused to do any drugs (except alcohol and cigarettes). I was in a different circle, and I thought I don't need it. Actually (and don't hate me because of this, I was an angry kid) I was into right-wing between my age of 16 to 22. I thought I don't need that kind of stuff, I am clean (and still got drunk with my ""*buddies""* in that time every weekend, but that somehow didn't appear as a logical fault. Anyways. At some point, I realized I was wrong, my beliefs are wrong, and the world is way more complicated than black and white, good and evil. So, I changed, left those people behind, looking for a more open, positive world view.

I met with a girl, she was a bit broken but spontaneous, courageous, and introduced me to the world of goa, psychedelic trance, and of course drugs. Weed, speed, ecstasy, MDMA, mushrooms... basically whatever she was able to got. For me, it was perfect, complete change... as they say in my country, falling to the other side of the horse. To some extent it was great, and I was introduced to whole new world, culture, mindset. The world was colorful and interesting again... for a while. Eventually, we broke up, because of many reasons, among which she was stealing money from me to buy drugs for herself. No hard feelings tho, she had a bad childhood as well. But my relationship with drugs didn't stop here. I was working at that time in advertising, and working on cocaine for 24-36 hours in a row (provided by my boss) was sometimes part of the job. Weed helped me to fall asleep after sessions like this.

Fast forward 10 years. I had other girlfriends, jobs, but weed was always part of my life. For a while, I was working as a freelancer, and I convinced myself working (or playing, it happened as well often) till 4-6 am, waking up in the afternoon is okay, until the job is done. But I realized I don't like to talk to people, being connected when I'm stoned. I became a lone stoner, using weed only when I was alone (except when I was on other drugs, when I thought the amphetamine rush will compensate for the anxiety of weed). I was balancing drugs with drugs.

Fast forward again. I moved to a new country since 5 years. I don't really speak the local language yet (german) because most of the time I was speaking in English. Luckily it's a pretty multicultural city, so I was able to get along with it ( I learned to talk in English after I came here, I hope I'm not that bad in it anymore). Here it's not that hard to get drugs, any kind of. When you walk downtown, you can find dealers very easily, and while it's not legal, not really illegal either. I stuck to my old habits, meeting with people sometimes, but more often staying at home, rolling joints after each other, playing games. Last year I was working for eBay as a freelancer, making good money, and I ruined it, and eventually got fired, because of the anxiety weed created in me. There were days, afternoons in work when I said ok, I can't take it anymore, I have to get home, hide from all of this crap, smoke a joint, and just do not think, do not feel. That was my mantra, my defense, my little fort with high walls, I don't need people, I'm fine with just working, playing in the evening, and that's an ok life. I told them I'm feeling sick, got to home, roll... Although I had a girlfriend, often I was telling to her, I have to get home, to do my stuff. You can imagine what that stuff was.

I became 40 in April. I realized, probably very fuckin late, I have to change. I can't do this anymore. I'm already wasted a lot of time, and I have to cope with anxiety, with the demons haunting me. And weed just makes everything, everything worse (in my case). I can't play the victim anymore. I can't say just because I had tough times smoking is ok, so many people had had way more terrible life but they're able to cope with it, therefore it can't be an excuse.

So, here's the thing. I'm in a new country, without many (or any) friends, where finding weed is simple, finding friends is hard. Without a girlfriend (that's a different story, she made it clear she never wants to have kids, and I do), without social connections. I started to exercise again, trying to meditate, trying to ditch Netflix and animes to books, still working, trying to quit smoking weed, tobacco, trying to find a purpose. It's only a few days since I'm emptied my weed sack, and sworn to the beautiful moon I will stop abusing my body and mind with these substances, and I a have hard times how to fill up my life, what to do instead of smoking, what to do to feed this vast emptiness inside me. Smoking made me nervous, anxious, but when I was stoned I wasn't worrying too much about the moment. Procrastination hell yeah. Now I do worry.

I'm not saying I've wasted my life completely. I was working a lot, learned many things, I think I'm quite resourceful, have many skills. But man, how much I would have accomplished without weed? I don't want to think about it. And I already hear my mind's whispering, *c'mon, call your guy. Just one. You don't need to roll every day. Or starting at the afternoon. You can set limits. You can roll only after 11pm. Or 10. Or 8. 7 6 5 4... Only one joint per day. Or maybe two.* And so on. And I know this is not how it works.

I'm alone, in a (still) new country, where I don't speak the language (but I'm learning it), where I don't have any friends, family, connections. But I won't fucking give up. Enough is enough. I don't need things to make me whole, I can be whole, I can establish a new life, make friends, be open to the world. I will get through on this. Wish me good luck.",7

2020-05-30 16:02:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gtkq0q/i_cant_stop/,I can’t stop.,"   I’ve been smoking weed most of my life. My first time was when I was 12, I am 34 now. When I was younger it wasn’t a regular thing, but gradually went from once a month to once a week. When I started college it became more frequent and higher doses. Now I’ve smoked weed almost everyday for over 10 years, even when I don’t want to. 

   I know that I don’t think as fast, or as clear when I am high, or if I smoked that day. It’s easier for me to go without getting high if I drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or consume other illicit drugs (not common). Honestly I prefer weed over all of the previously mentioned. It has held back my performance at work and school, and messed up relationships with past girlfriends.

   If I’m busy with friends, or really doing ANYTHING with ANYONE I have no desire to smoke or get high. But I know as soon as I am alone, bored, or need a distraction, eventually I’ll take at least a little hit. On excellent days I can fight the urge and not smoke, sometimes for consecutive days. Eventually I break down and go to the weed store, even when I know I shouldn’t waste money. Then once I have it it in my possession, I can’t resist. On bad days, I’ll start smoking first thing when I wake up, mostly out of habit, then continue all day. Most days are somewhat in the middle of good and bad, I will be able to resist most of the day, then at some point in the evening I will smoke little.

   I tell myself it is out of habit, but lately I’m starting to see it more as addiction. It feels like a great first step just writing this out. But honestly I don’t know what to do next. I need support and help. I’m getting to the age when most of my peers have ‘matured’ out of smoking weed. I feel silly asking them for help over weed addiction. My family has no idea, it would be so random and surprising to them, I don’t want to tell them. I cant afford a therapist or any type of rehab. So here I am, I have been an avid Redditor for years. I cant believe it took me so long to find this group, but I am so incredibly happy to be here.

Every time you're high you think to yourself that you should stop smoking. While in this delusional and foggy state you wish that you were sober. Waking up the next day groggy and unproductive you promise that you won't smoke for the next week. You make yourself a coffee and try to make the most out of your day but you know that you aren't operating at 100%. You've been limited by this plant and you can see it so clearly because you've been through days like these for years. 

Then night time rolls around, or your friend calls you, or the music is hitting just right and you get that oh so familiar craving for the herb. At first you brush it off and remember that you don't want to smoke. Then you crave again and think about how the high will be, you think it will be nice to relax with your friend, you think it will make the music sound even better, yet you still remember why you don't want to smoke. The third craving hits. You remember the high even more fondly and start to rationalize the negatives that were once so clear to you and you pick up the plant reluctantly. The night becomes a blur and you wake up the next day repeating the same cycle.

&#x200B;

I hope people can relate to this. It is what I have been going through the past few months. Despite the negative tone, last night I said no to my brother's request to smoke with him. I was craving the high but I thought back to this community and was able to deny the request. I am proud of myself for declining.

That was really discouraging, I remember so many other people that warned me about this. 

The month and a half before that was pretty good, so it hit me as a surprise that it would be that strong. I mean I had some off days in that month and a half but usually very manageable. Either way it seems like it’s improving slowly still I’ve gotten some hobbies and I’m staying positive. I’m eating as well as I can and sleeping as well as I can too with exercise every other day. 

I should mention that for the past almost month vivid dreams came back, so vivid I wake up exhausted. I thought that went away month 4/5 also sometimes I feel a bit of anxiety going to bed but usually very manageable. I guess all I can do is keep going and hope I’ll be at a baseline with in a year. However after smoking for 11 years through late teens and early 20s I guess I can’t expect to feel “normal” in 8 months. 

I had this thought last night, I bruised my toe nail at the gym back when they were open almost 6 months ago (what the hell does this have to do with it) lol well in that time the bruise nail has been slowly growing out as I cut it, it’s closer to the end. Yet it has taken around 6 months and it still not at the end (bruise was at the edge of skin/nail. My thought is if it takes that long for that process how do I expect my brain to be at a baseline in 8 months when I pumped it full of THC for years. Idk made sense to me lol

I was recently diagnosed with asthma and with good respiratory health being critical these days I knew I needed to make a change and quit for my own well being. Any feelings of calming my anxiety and PTSD by using are not worth dying over. Using it to sleep is not worth dying over. It’s time to quit for good. 

My last smoke session was the night of the 27th of May. It’s been manageable so far but some of my withdrawal symptoms have been quite bothersome.

I experienced night sweats for the first time last night but it was only once. Woke up feeling not great so I’m trying to hydrate and get some food in. 

I’ve been reading a lot of testimonies from different people about their withdrawal symptoms. In addition to mood swings, lack of appetite, restlessness and sleep being very hard to come by, has anyone else run a very low grade fever (between 99 and 99.8 degrees) throughout the day when you first quit??

The fever is barely noticeable but it’s definitely there. Sometimes I’ll break out into a light sweat but that is rare. 

Anyone willing to share their testimonies about their withdrawal periods would be welcome! Every person’s body reacts differently so I know my timeline will not be the same as everyone else’s but this seems like a great place to get helpful info from people who genuinely care and aren’t just going to tell me that it’s all in my head or that I should just start smoking again.",1

At first it felt refreshing, like I could start enjoying things again. Life didn't seem as dull as I thought. Food tasted 100x better, tv shows became entertaining again; heck, even the view out of my bedroom window looked great.

Little did I realize that I started to neglect parts of my life little by little. I'd call my family less, wouldn't care enough to keep in touch with my friends that aren't stoners too, stopped thinking and doing anything about my future career. I kept digging myself into a deep hole.

And now with the quarantine, I've spent the past 3 months just smoking and doing nothing else but that. I thought I'd be able to turn things around, but whenever I take the first step, my craving would kick in, and I'd be back in square one, lazing around in bed and doing nothing else. I make cannabis my excuse to being stuck in a state of inaction.

Got a report to do? I got 3 days left, lets smoke and binge eat instead. Oh I'm supposed to send in my job application today. Ah whatever, I probably wont get an interview anyways, let's smoke to feel better about it.

It turned into a vicious cycle of hating myself because I haven't done anything, so let's do nothing and smoke to feel better about myself! Rinse and repeat.

It started with me smoking once or twice a week just on the nights that were really stressful or I had a hard time sleeping. Then it turned into nightly, then daily, and now I start my day with it and smoke several bowls a day. 

I used to believe smoking helped my stress and anxiety levels and I have since realized that is not the case. I've tried quitting a few times, and the longest I had gone is 5 days. It doesn't help that my friends, family, and boyfriend are supportive of the habit and they don't see or understand why I want to quit. Everytime I talk to them about it they always say something like ""oh why don't you just reduce the amount and only smoke ay night"" but that just straight up does not work for me, I need to quit.

One of the things I had difficulties with is missing the routine. I love love LOVE going outside with my pipe and just chilling, listening to music, journaling and smoking. What am I going to do to replace the smoking or the satisfaction of holding the pipe?

I have no idea where to begin. What do I do?",17

My lungs feel like they are starting to recover now that I've totally quit cigarettes (was smoking over a pack a day for a year) and begun quitting pot.

It was too harsh, anyways. Some pipes as well. But when I got to my first ever pipe (that somehow never broke in the past 14 years) and bubbler (that's just soo pretty) I couldn't do it. It just felt like such a waste to throw away someone's art. Also, too many memories attached. 

I thought it would be ok to keep if I just hid it away in the closet. Out of sight, out of mind. But it didn't work and before I know it, I've refilled my stash and the bubbler has taken it's usual spot on the coffee table. 

It really is all or nothing. I can't just smoke on the weekends. I can't just have one little bowl. I can't keep paraphernalia, even it's just for sentimental reasons. A crack addict wouldn't hold onto their crack pipe. A heroin addict wouldn't keep their spoons. At least, not for the same reasons as I'm keeping my glass.

It's a constant battle of quitting, starting, quitting, starting, over and over and over. It's exhausting. I don't even feel good when I smoke anymore. I don't get high, I just get tired.

 I've been trying to go without the past few days.. I'm on day 3 today, it's not the first time ive got to this point but following the isolation we've all had to endure recently I feel like it's 10 times more difficult. 

I'm currently living with my partner and her family due to some pretty rubbish circumstances, I'd be lying if I said her family likes me and I like them so arguments are often. I struggle with OCD and depression amongst other things.. Anger is also a common problem for me.

So clearly becoming irritable is a huge side affect, also the lack of sleep and stomach cramps which have been excruciating. All this combined with the occasional comment of ""maybe wait until your situation is a little better before trying such a difficult task"".. I understand where people are coming from but I feel like cannabis is the reason my life is not how I want it to be.. everything has gone down hill and I've always felt like whenever I take one step forward, it results in 3 steps back. 

So this is where I'm struggling.. in my head I desperately want to quit because I have changed so much as a person since my teen years, I'm 25 now and have been smoking since I was 13 after my dad passed away. Unfortunately his passing effected me badly and I turned to abuse, which has clearly damaged my brain over the years; paranoia, anxiety and now also questioning where I'm Bi-polar. 

Am I right in sticking with it and just dealing with the side effects the best I can, at the risk of being a D**k to people unintentionally.. or do I listen to there advice and wait until I'm in a less stressful environment. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I feel like I can't cope with this battle much longer. It has worn down my personality and confidence for years now but I just don't know how to stop. 

So yeah, sorry for rambling.. 👍 good luck everyone",5

There are a lot of days that make up four years of college, and I was high on almost all of them. They are some of the best and worst memories of my life. 

In the beginning, the allure of smoking weed was obvious: deep thoughts, reflections, conversations, and a visceral, almost sensual joy of music, movies, and food. In time, however, I learned of the painful side effects: deep anxiety, endless self-doubt, mental fog, and the feeling of being a prisoner in my own mind. 

Like my new friendships, these intensely contradictory experiences allowed me to explore myself and my reality. It was exhilarating to lose myself among my thoughts while listening to the grooviest music I could find. And around the right people, I could be weird, funny, and honest in ways I couldn’t always be when sober. This was how it brought out the best in me. But it always came at a price.

At some point during almost every sesh, my thoughts would turn inward and I’d notice my fears needle their way to the front of my mind, leaving me lost in what felt like a house of mirrors. I was scared of my own reflection. I was terrified of what people might think of me. I was upset with how I was spending so much of my time. And most of all, I was afraid that I’d end up spending the rest of my life high because it was becoming the only way I knew how to function. At my worst, I thought I was going insane.

The high highs and low lows that marked each of my days, weeks, and semesters tore me apart. I had known for a while that I (and many of the stoners I knew) had a problem. After all, if I had a healthy relationship with weed, then why was I high all the time and why did I smoke even when I didn’t want to?

Every day was the same and I always wrestled over one question: s*hould I smoke today or not?* 

In the morning I’d tell myself I wouldn’t. “Today’s the day I clear my mind and get a grip!” I’d think. But of course, by the time I fell asleep I’d be as high as a kite. The cycle would repeat itself until the end of the semester, by which time I felt like a complete slave to smoking. It was a self-destructive, misery-inducing loop. 

At certain points, I did make more serious attempts to quit, but they usually only succeeded during semester breaks when I was physically away from school. None truly lasted. The environment around me at school was a perfect recipe for dependence: too much free time, plenty of people to smoke with, easy access, and too little responsibility. Sometimes I thought I would never be free. My greatest hope was that I knew college would one day come to an end.

Eventually, it did. A year ago today, I moved away from my college town and started my next chapter in life. My mind was ripe with thoughts of quitting weed and I knew I’d be away from old friends and dealers. I finally had what I needed: the right mindset and the right environment. The latter made biggest the difference.

Yes, I soon made a commitment to myself to live substance-free for as long as I could, but in hindsight, I know that it was my new environment that gave me a fighting chance. Having a few months without anyone to smoke with and being at least an inconvenient distance away from a supply, I got over the biggest hurdle.

During that time, I started exercising, going outside more, and doing pretty much whatever made me happy. It was a wonderful way to relearn who I was. I didn’t need weed to be myself. In fact, I saw I *needed* to be without out it to be myself. Knowing this, I found the greatest peace I had experienced in years. I finally felt free. 

These initial months of sobriety weren’t perfect of course, but I felt like I had turned a big corner in my life. My new relationship with myself was forged in self-commitment and this made it easier to remove some other negative influences in my life. I won’t get into those here, but I decided I finally had the momentum to be more deliberate about pursuing joy in a healthy way.

As a result, the rest of this year has been the most grounded and anxiety-free year since before my teens. I only had the opportunity to smoke weed a few times since last May, but by the time I did, it was easy to say no. Of course I still have days that are hard to get through, like everyone else, and I even still dream about smoking weed from time to time, but I find it ten times easier to deal with the hard days than when I had unbalanced my mind with weed. It’s one of the greatest gifts I’ve ever given myself.

The last thing I want to share is how I’ve come to process and view my whole journey with weed. One of the main issues that people struggle with, especially when it comes to addiction, is shame. It’s something I lived with for a long time and I think it’s what allowed weed to take over my life. Consequently, I think to truly move on from my relationship with weed, I also had to move on from the shame. I had to accept and own my experience.

There’s a wonderful interview between Joe Rogan and Guy Ritchie on Joe’s podcast that touches upon this theme so well. For me, the best part is when Guy explains the Parable of the Prodigal Son. To make it super short, the story is about a father with two sons. The younger one goes off and spends his inheritance indulging himself and fooling around and after a while, spends all his money, is unhappy, and starving. He returns home and to his father and older brother and the father tells him, “you were lost and now you’re found.” Despite the older son’s loyalty and apparent lack of foolishness, the father slaughters their last remaining animal and gives it to the younger son so he can eat. The end.

It’s a confusing story if you take it literally, but Guy shows how the Parable symbolizes the journey we each must take to become self-realized. The younger son represents our curious and naïve ego that must journey into the material world in order to learn and to experience. The father is who we really are. The reason we are enough. It’s the permanent aspect of ourselves we are always in search of. And the older son is our intellect and kind of gets left out because he can’t understand the significance of the journey the younger brother, as he tries to, “reconcile and make sense of a prosaic world.” Thus, Guy says the moral of the story is that, “you have to leave yourself to understand the value of yourself” because the younger, Prodigal Son, “finds that he can’t escape himself so he has to return to himself and at which point he has to accept who he is.”

This was my journey with weed. It’s the same for anyone else who smokes too much or parties too much or even Instagrams too much and so on and so forth. We get attracted by shiny things that make us forget about some of the pain we carry around. Some of those shiny things become so attractive that we sprint after them until we’re much more miserable than before. It’s only when we’ve run so far down this rabbit hole that we realize we were enough in the first place and can learn how to save ourselves. 

With this perspective, I can move on from looking at my years ‘in the clouds’ with shame because I see that I needed them to get where I am now. I really did need lose my sobriety and peace and self-worth to find value in reclaiming them. Otherwise, I wouldn’t really know what I’m made of.

So with that said, for everyone on r/leaves who’s struggling to quit weed, has quit, or struggles with a similar issue in another form, I would love for you to see that there is nothing to be ashamed of. Abusing a substance is a painful way to lose what’s important, but in the bigger picture, this type of journey is something we all go through. It manifests in different ways, but it all has a value. We learn and we become through this struggle. 

Thank you, weed, for the lessons!

And thank you to this sub! I send you all my deepest love and support.",84

It's doing a number on my physical body and my spirit. I feel like I'm not the person I was supposed to be. If I want to get serious and make use of my life, I need to leave it behind.

I had my last session with my sister who uses it very often. She comes over most nights and I usually end up toking with her. I've resisted on occasion and the last few quits, but last night I caved. She had a strawberry fields vape pen and initially it felt like one of the most pleasant highs I've had in awhile. We watched the Beatles music video and laughed about how appropriately it was named, then after a short time I could feel the sense of guilt. I noticed how desperate weed made me for it, I was just waiting for my sister to pass the pen to me again, and felt the annoyance when she didn't. After she left I just felt kind of dragged out. I stayed up way too late and before I slept I laid in bed, closed my eyes, and truly felt what it was like to be high for the last time. It's not that great if I'm being honest; my lungs hurt, my heart was pounding, I was restless and felt unsatisfied with my state of being.

So here are the reasons:

* *My art suffers.* If I am high it's incredibly unlikely I'll make myself do anything of value. My headspace just ain't right. I have learned high art is not my best art. If I do end up creating my sketches become poorly executed, drawings become too strange for personal taste, paintings become overworked, and ideas become forgotten and tossed aside as something to do later when I'm not high.
* *My memory suffers.* I value my intellect, learning new things, recollection of memories, and having meaningful conversations. Just last night I couldn't quite remember what Paul McCartney's name was when watching the music video and I've known of the Beatles my entire life. I've had many of these instances, and it's embarrassing.
* *My mental health suffers.* Even when stoned I can really be a twat. During withdrawal it's even worse. I'm irritable, reactive, impatient, depressed, and lethargic. I don't feel like doing much even if I want to. I want to feel like my life is worth living and derive happiness and contentment from simple pleasure. I fear what I've done to my brain and if the damage is done. My family has a history of mental illness and I'm afraid that my mental health has taken a hit as I've carried on with this habit. I am going to take up more exercise to combat this, but I can feel that my brain is off like it's just not what it should be.
* *My body suffers.* Aside from what I've already described with my lungs, heart, and brain. I know it affects my hormones. I know how delicate the balance is with the female hormone system and after doing some research I now know how cannabis can hijack this system. I have enough stress in my life and I don't need more cortisol circulating in my body. I also get the munchies really bad and crave carbohydrates like crazy. I've gained weight and feel uncomfortable with how much I end up eating. I want to have a healthier relationship with food and know that quitting would help that.
* *My relationships suffer.* My family counts on me to be responsible and clear headed. I owe it to myself to value these relationships enough to quit this shit. It makes me secretive, selfish, and feel inauthentic. I want to be clearheaded enough to handle disagreements healthily and with compassion. I want to be a good role-model for the little ones in my life. I want to be very aware of my true thoughts and feelings to be able to protect myself from manipulative people. I want to be sociable and not feel I'm acting strange around people cause I'm stoned. I don't like being concerned that certain people will judge me because I'm high or use weed. I've also said some pretty embarrassing things while high, that I doubt I would have said if sober. I've also missed out on and have damaged some romantic relationships due to being high.
* *My sleep cycle suffers.* If I smoke, I stay up too late and my thoughts race. I wake up groggy and much later than I'd like. I also know my REM sleep is disrupted. I want to more productive and have more energy in the morning.
* *My finances suffer.* I don't need weed. I can't really afford to spend monthly about a hundred dollars on an herb that doesn't truly improve my health, and that in fact hinders it.
* *My productivity suffers.* I might feel the desire to do something when I'm high, but I rarely fulfill any task to completion. All these projects, books I want to read, studying, cleaning, etc. get pushed to the wayside. I just want to do what is easy and fun. Basically chasing the easiest dopamine hit. What fun is that?
* *I want to move forward.* Most importantly I've learned what weed has done for me. Some of it good, some of it bad. The bad has outweighed the good for years now. That for me is a sure sign of an unhealthy relationship that I can no longer be a part of. I want to be free from this addiction and know that it doesn't serve my highest purpose anymore. I intend to enjoy and endure life as nature intended and evolve into a person that I feel at peace with in spite of the past.",18

I’m a 15+ year 2-3 joints a day smoker.  A week I decided to quit weed once and for all and the first few days were a bit rough but it’s been getting better.  Here are the positives in just the first week

* I used to read maybe one book a year but this week was able to get though 2 books without a problem.  It was...weird

* Emotionally I feel like I was able to open up to my wife, something I needed to do.  I was able to honestly cry and not keep my emotions inside

* Better conversations with family and friends.  I feel like I’m in the present and not thinking of smoking another joint. 

* Happier.  Weed definitely did not make me happier

* Progress on side projects I’ve been holding off for months

* Better sleep and very vivid dreams.  

* More energy throughout the day

The first week was tougher than I thought it would be but it gets better.  I still have intense cravings and thought about calling my dealer a few times but stopped myself.  

New leavers or leavers that are struggling, try ONE WEEK without smoking.  You will notice the differences",31

2020-05-29 10:25:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gsty08/this_is_hard/,This is hard,"I (25f) smoked weed pretty much everyday for like 8-10 years, starting when I was 15 or 16 and it had turned into an everyday habit pretty quickly. I spent a lot of my life focused on weed. In college, I went to every class high and was high all day everyday the entire time. I regret that, but somehow I made it through college successfully. Once I got a real job, I knew I needed to stop smoking during the day, and I accomplished that. I even managed to go through some periods where I was only smoking on the weekend, but over the last year it became every single night, and on the weekends usually multiple times a day. My life did become less centered around it, and I made friends who didn't smoke and I did lots of activities without smoking. Then once the stay at home orders hit, and I started working from home, it was so hard not to smoke all day every day. I realized I could basically do my job high, and it was a struggle. I was smoking throughout the day again. So I decided to quit. I went strong for almost a month, then relapsed. Then was strong for another 2 weeks, then relapsed again because I was going through a really hard time with my boyfriend and I thought smoking might give me some clarity about the situation. It actually did, and I was able to approach our issue with a lot more kindness and sensitivity for him than I was while I was sober, and we actually did work things out. That time, I was just honest with my roommate and she smoked me out and made sure I was ok and safe. I don't have any weed because having it would be too tempting. Then a week later I relapsed again, just because. For no good reason, I just wanted to smoke so bad and couldn't resist. The worst part is, I don't have weed of my own so that time I stole some from my other roommate (she's gone temporarily for the quarantine). I feel bad. I just knew it was there, and the craving got the better of me. Now I'm almost at another week clean. This is just annoying and hard. I want to smoke weed at night, or on the weekend. I like it so much. I like how it feels, how it calms me, how I am able to see things with a nicer perspective, how I feel less stressed, etc. I have a great life, I'm successful, have a lot of friends, have things I care about deeply, and before quarantine I was going out a lot doing things I like to do with my friends, and also dating successfully. Weed wasn't \*really\* interfering with my life. The main reason I stopped is because I just knew it wasn't good for me. It's bad for my brain and lungs, definitely. And I care about my brain and lungs. It's costly, I was smoking a lot, like 2-3 bowls every single night. It took away my dreams (like actual dreams when you sleep). And also really affecting my memory, both long and short term. And I always felt like I needed a whole day out of every week or two weeks to just be alone in my room smoking all day, I felt like I deserved that time to chill and check out of life. Now I feel a lot better if I have a chill to myself day but don't smoke, and do things like yoga, walks, make meals, go to the park, etc. But god damn it's hard. I love weed. I really do. I have been trying to get to the deeper reason of WHY I smoked so much, but I truly don't even know other than I just LIKE IT. And that makes it so hard to stay strong. Ugh. Just had to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading if you did.",9

Some days I could not eat unless I was high, couldn’t sleep unless I smoked before bed and I found myself thinking about bud subconsciously literally all day long. At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted this to be permanent but, I feel overwhelmingly refreshed and am very proud of how far I have come.

So it turns out that I live across the street from a very cute girl who as it turns out is exactly the kind of goofy, adorable, degenerate stoner gal I always used to fall for. Yesterday she invited me over and when I walked into her house I was immediately punched by the smell of dope and every surface was covered with dirty glass and Pepsi cans and lighters etc. She showed me a room literally bursting with plants and kept offering me every format of marijuana under the sun.  Finally I lied and said I got drug tested for work but on my way out she gave me THC tincture for my neck. 

The whole time I was itching to get high again and so when I got home I ate it with toast COMPLETELY forgetting that shit is extremely potent and edibles are no joke. I had a miserable night waking up constantly, pounding headache and overcome with paranoia. Also -  it was the night before my birthday (yesterday). I spent all day with an intense migraine and coughing and freaking out about coronavirus. I had to cancel plans with friends and with work and feel so down on myself. I have been sober for most of this past year and not getting to start off 23 strong and with this horrible secret is really getting me down. 

The definition of addiction is when doing the thing interferes with other stuff you want to do and holy moly THAT. Also if I wasn't an addict we could have lit up and chilled at her place and it would have been fine. The fact that I was so secretive and excessive in my abuse is a big red flag I am NOT ignoring. 

I have relapsed before and I'm sure I'll do it again. So for today I'm gonna drink my black coffee and read shitty sci fi and start to reconstruct the ultimately pointless but extremely endearing little life I've been building for myself. 

Happy Fucking Birthday to me",7

I've put off writing a post since Day 3, but some of you may have seen my many comments over the last three days. This marks 1 day further than my last attempt 2 weeks ago, and I am feeling stronger than ever. Had my first therapy session today! Also finally getting some sleep, but does anyone else feel like they are still exhausted all day?!

Also, I had two instances where I didn't give into other substances. Firstly, I got given a beer, had a sip, and with the headaches I've been getting, it did nothing but make it worse (or even the feeling of it coming on made me hate it) and threw it out after that first sip. Secondly, an old friend offered for me to go around to his and do some coke. Told him I was sick and bedridden. I was on a walk. :)

Another benefit is definitely the whiter teeth and better breath. Feel like I can be more confident with da ladies in the future.

Lastly, there are a couple of things that I've thought about that I wanted to share:

* I've tried to focus my mind on not reminiscing about the times I've been high but try and focus on everything I did before I got high (as we all know, memory is not the best, so took out some photos to remember!). This enforces that things are going to get better and you can have good times without weed. (Like remembering that I loved a good burger when I was a kid, why can't I experience that again? Which I did! Last night for the first time I could actually eat something!!)
* Also, the **time** has been a big realisation since quitting. Because weed made everything interesting it felt like time flied. One thing you have to face is a long and drawn out day. But further and further into this I'm trying to realise that the extra time in the day can be good. (Although it is very hard to adjust)

Thanks to this community for keeping me going strong! I couldn't be doing this without all of you!

Feel free to message anytime (lots of free time to waste) and we can get through it together.

For the past month and a bit my partner and I have been trying to get clean from it, reading everyone's story's has opened my eyes to how easily and unaware weed can take over your life and the fact it's so easy to act sober around people who don't know, but we've had a few slip ups so far and the guilt after getting on and the high afterwards just isn't the same anymore, I feel guilty and ashamed of myself for caving, but I just keep telling myself hey, you made it 3 days without any them maybe smoked the next 2 but then had 4 days off then smoked that night, it might not seem like much but more and more I'm seeing weed for what it truly is, yes physically it may not be super harmful but mentally I have found it one of the hardest struggles. It got to a point where I lost my job and had to move 5 hours back home to live with my parents again, but that didn't stop me for another year or 2 until these past couple months

I think I've finally cracked it!,"I have been a regular user of weed since I was around 13, stopping for a 7 year period when I was in the Army. I left the Army in 2015 and since then I've been smoking them everyday, like they're cigarettes! Usually an ounce would last about 4 weeks but since the lockdown that came rapidly down to 2 weeks. 

When it came to me joining the Army, I had my last joint at the train station and it was as simple as putting it out and jumping on the train. I didn't have the slightest urge for a joint or any withdrawals whatsoever. However, it was a totally different story  the other countless times!

I believe the first time around was so easy because I was starting a new journey in my life, filled with excitement and meaning. I feel guilty saying this as its like I have no meaning now, but I do! I have just had my 3rd child, I have a beautiful wife who I get on well with, so now there should be more meaning than ever, it just feels so much different now!

I have tried so many times before this to quit, and failed everytime. But this time feels different, I'm actually excited to not be a slave to weed anymore. Instead of having the irritable feeling I've had constantly the other times I've tried to abstain, now I am filled with excitement again to get my life back on track!

As cliché as it sounds... You have really WANT to do it. I've wanted to quit most days when I was using. It took over every part of my life. I would have to have a joint first thing in the morning, and before I did even the simplest tasks. Going to see mum - I'll have a joint before I go, need to clean up - better have a joint first, just had something to eat - I must have a joint.. Then it got to the point where any slightly stressful situation I'd have to have one. Sometimes the kids would be messing around while I'm outside having a joint, so when I go back in I'd make another one to de-stress again, and it goes on and on in a vicious cycle.

When it came to quitting before I would be constantly irritable, whining and stressing at the slightest things. I'd often make excuse after excuse. The main one was I didn't want my wife or kids to see me acting like a little bitch and kicking off over anything, so the noble thing to do in my eyes was to carry on smoking and everything would be ok because they wouldn't have to see me acting the way I was. I would find any excuse, I won't sleep, I won't be able to go out and socialise, I won't be able do anything. All of this is untrue!

After listening to Allen Carr's ""Stop smoking and quit e-cigarettes"" audiobook, I learned that the craving for nicotine is similar to the one you have when you are hungry. When I've tried quitting in the past I either lose my appetite or purposely put myself on a ""I only want weed"" hunger strike. I also hardly smoke as many cigarettes when trying to quit weed. All these cravings put together with the thought of giving up your crutch make it stupidly hard and enhance the craving for weed.

This time round I was a lot more level-headed. Earlier this year I started buying stocks (great timing with the coronavirus), it is something I have wanted to do in a long time. When I knew I was running low on weed a few days ago, I spent the £170 I would of spent on an ounce on stocks. The logic here was that if I did want to buy more weed, I'd have to sell the stock I had just bought, and I know I really wouldn't want to.

I know I have only done 2 days without weed so it's nothing to celebrate just yet. I have quit for longer than this before, for some reason though this time around feels so much easier. Instead of feeling like I have given something up, I feel like I have been freed. I haven't had any of the bad thoughts and feelings this time so to me, I do feel like I can celebrate just a little bit!",3

Sure, it would be easy to go back to old habits and not deal with anything, but what I’m starting to learn in life is anything that’s easy probably isn’t worth it. I’ve never heard anyone successful say ‘I didn’t work hard’ or ‘it was easy to get where I am’. If it’s difficult, it’s because it’s worth it. 

PS I’m only on day 25 of quitting so I’m certainly no expert on this subject. I just wanted to share something that’s helping me through this difficult time. I wish everyone the best on their own personal journey!",7

I get cravings at least once a week still. Pot was my coping mechanism for some serious mental health issues. I quit, had a severe mental break down winding up in hospital. I went through intense therapies and learnt to cope without marijuana, though the temptation is always there.

A lot of shits gone down recently, my physical health is declining and it’s affected my mental health. I find myself daydreaming about just ripping a cone sitting back and letting that high hit me. God I miss that feeling so fucking much! I wish I could just go back to smoking occasionally, but I’m not capable of keeping it to an occasional thing. Addiction is in my blood, one hit would turn into an addiction real quickly. I’ve quit and started again many times and each time I got full blown addicted.

I though, YES I quit weed. Now that I have that monkey off my back, happiness will come. 

I got a new job and worked myself to the bone. Now that I'm clean . I should be happier right. Quarantine is in effect and I smoked weed. It made me realize how sad I was. Sober me, High me, all lead to sad me.  

Just being clean, isn't good enough anymore.  I need to work on myself. This is a lot harder then just tossing away my bad of weed.

Weed was taking over my life (for about 2.5 years) and making me depressed, and I was using it to escape and for my severe anxiety. I spoke to my therapist and made a list of all the things I hated about weed, and was excited to start my new journey. The problem is I'm at my familys house, and my brother smokes ALL THE TIME. He has edibles in his room, and vapes constantly, in front of me, even though i've told him to be mindful of me he just does NOT get it.  

Late last night, I was walking past his room and saw his vape pen sitting on his bed unattended. I had a SEVERE urge to smoke, stronger than any of the urges I've ever had (and i've had a lot over the past 10 days).  I kept going back and forth in my mind as to whether I should smoke, and decided to take one massive hit, and was extremely high. To be honest, it felt really good, but in the morning i was just so upset and mad at myself, and ashamed that I couldn't even go two weeks without this substance. But now, all I can do is think about weed and how much I want to smoke again. 

I don't want to be in this cycle anymore where I take a week or two off, smoke again, and then find myself smoking constantly to numb myself. I have a very compulsive/obsessive personality, which is why I cant smoke in moderation. But i'm also terrified of making a commitment not to smoke again, when it was once something I loved.

Im posting as often as i can so im not just a “lurker”. 

Id feel like im being selfish by reading all this wonderful information and not contributing. Sometimes just to read someone else’s struggle brings a sense of relief, and for that im indebted. 

Its only been 3 days, 3 long days. 3 extremely emotionally, physically and mentally painful days. But here i am. Trying to stand strong for myself. If im honest i dont WANT to quit smoking. Its a huge part of who i am. I grew up around it, my parents smoked and i remember as a kid going out to the garage and smelling “that smell” which i later learn to be marijuana. My brothers smoke, and as i got older my best-friend and i would smoke the weed id steal from my parents tin. Ill never forget the first time i smoked with my friends. I wish i never took that first puff. I hung around older kids and so i guess this is how it all started. 

Im not here to demonize marijuana. It has ALOT of amazing medicinal benefits. But im an addict, therefore i have ZERO self control and abused the beautiful plant. Bowl after bowl, joint after joint. Everyday, all day. Still “functioning” in society. I hold a good job, have had many relationships over the years both friendships and romantic relationships. and i have money in the bank. Lifes great, right? Nah. 

I didnt realize the impact abusing this drug was doing to me because i was so stoned all the time. I didnt even call it a drug i called it a herb. So it didnt seem so “bad”. But call it whatever you want its still mind altering and anything that alters your mind alters your perception. At times this can be great, if regulated. Again, i cant regulate.  

So whats the problem for me?

I took a good hard look at my life because i want more out of it. I kind of always knew if i wanted to get more out of life and further my career (personal trainer) id need to quit eventually. 

I wrote a pros/cons list which is what really did it for me. Im a fan of lists as it forces us to think concretely. Heres my list for those who are curious.

Pros:

1 - “relaxed”

2 - somthing to do

3- fun  

The reason #1 is in quotes is i often would toke and feel anxious (due to increased heart rate), slightly paranoid and absolutely over think. So am i really relaxed 🧐

2-3 to me are similar reasons.

Now for the cons:

1- foggy brain

2- expensive

3- living in my mind vs present moment

4- constant burnout

5- constant need to make sure i have time to smoke i.e. not scheduling clients in the evening even tho THEY NEED ME. Selfish.

6- putting myself in sketchy situations (im from canada where its legal but i like to travel internationally and must find it once there. Many times ive had sketchy situations and 1 hostile situation. 

7-late night munchies

8-dependent on it/slave to it

9-unmotivated

10- short term memory loss(dont remember alot of important dates and things i attended stoned)

11- interferes with my love life with my girlfriend im too high to be romantic.

Im sure alot of people will disagree and say “but it helps me with my anxiety and getting thru the boring parts of my day or if i have a bad day its how i rewind.

I felt the exact same but then you become SLAVE to it and rely on it. Not a good long term solution.
  
SO, What i did was learn new coping methods/tools e.g CBT or ACT (google them) awell as becoming more spiritual and living and honouring the present moment ( living in the now) Because after all thats all we ever have. I also practiced meditation to help unwind.

I started practicing all this in my many years of smoking. Only issue is id smoke up after CBT courses i took, or right after a meditation. Or id be too stoned to meditate and living in the present moment when your high? For me, yeah right. All i could hear is the voice in my head.It was seriously limiting my growth. 


My conclusion is this. If your content with being content in life and want to stay in the same spot with limited growth and be a slave to the plant by all means go for it. But i certainly dont. As my mom reminded me “im sick and tired of being sick and tired” enough is enough I WANT MY LIFE BACK!

If your still reading this thank you. I hope by sharing my thoughts will help somebody else. If even one person not feel so alone. Because i know the struggle. I may write like i know what im talking about but we all know its much easy to give advice than to take our own. So maybe if you see me in a dark place on here, do me a favour please? Remind me of what i already know and please, share some of your wonderful stories and advice.

I’ve been doing the “next week” thing for a couple weeks now (which reminds me a lot of how I drank) and I’m starting to get really down on myself for not sticking to it. In rehab they really pushed the idea that you have to be 100% sober because any substance will just lead you back to your drug of choice .. so I was nervous to smoke again but I did just a couple days after leaving rehab and me not going back to drinking (yet, always possible) I told myself that it was fine - way less destructive than alcohol, which is true for me, but now I feel like it’s gone from choosing to get high to just a habit that I do throughout the day. I am so scared to be completely sober, to have nothing to fall back on. In the beginning weed actually felt really helpful with quitting alcohol “at least I have something” and I don’t know if I’m ready to give up that up. Ive only really been completely sober for the month that I was in rehab, and it was some of the worst and hardest days of my life so I don’t really know what it’s like to be completely sober in my “normal” life and frankly I don’t know if I want to be - but I do know that right now I’m not happy with the way I’m living, weed is not bettering my life, it’s likely holding my back and I could probably be happier and more fulfilled if I gave it up .. but I’m terrified, stopping drinking was so incredibly hard and I feel defeated by the thought of not having any “fun, relaxing, social” substance to comfort me .. any advice for the very beginning, or what you’ve learned since stopping would be much appreciated",3

I was with my family during Memorial Day and I felt awful. There was an anger inside of me that seemingly came from everywhere and nowhere. I just wanted to relax and have a good time. I went to the dispensary and bought a bag of gummies. I started with one and eventually ate another 2 and a half. Honestly, it was really nice. I immediately felt calmer and when it started to set in, I was able to sit with my cousins and sister and just chill with them. They were all playing Stardew Valley which is generally not my style of entertainment. I like fast paced, competitive games - COD, OverWatch, Rocket League.  I decided to be open minded and started a profile of my own. Fifteen minutes later I was full of euphoria and peace, tilling the land of my new farm. I continued to hang out with my cousins and sister for hours without feeling the need to go home or change activities. The only negative part was me not being able to focus on the show we're watching together. I could not focus on it as hard as I tried. I would be present with it for maybe 20 seconds and then I would be distracted by my own thoughts.

&#x200B;

I was sober the next day and didn't feel any regrets about my decision. I thought ""maybe I'm cured and I can eat an edible every once in a while and it will be healthy."" The day after that rolls around and, again, I'm fine until around 4pm and I think ""might as well eat some more of those gum gums."" It was fun but definitely not as fun as Memorial Day. I got the munchies and ate nearly three times as much as usual. I played Call of Duty with my friend and did very badly. I had a nice time playing guitar though and I was able to hang out with my dad for nearly an hour which is generally a huge test of my patience.

&#x200B;

That was yesterday. Today I am starting to think about getting more gummies. Why not? I don't work and I'm not in summer classes. I go on vacation to Colorado next week and I could stop when that is over. I know this is not in the r/leaves spirit to think this way. I want to be real though. I can't afford to fall back into addiction. I had already told myself I was going to wait until next week to eat more gummies and that plan fell apart. I bet I would have a bad ass day today if I was high though. smh.",1

I smoke maybe around 3-7 joints daily. I smoke hash because you get more bang for your buck, plus I love cigarettes so you're killing two birds with one joint. I smoke so much sometimes I have the worst headache, but I'll keep going like the trooper I am. 

I think it's safe to say I lost control of weed almost immediately, it fixed everything. But now it's 4 years later and I have nothing left. I alienated my family and friends, I killed my education and any career it would have led to (the police caught me once, so that's on the record now).

And the worst thing is... it's not the drugs fault, it's mine. Plenty of people seem to have their usage under control, not me. 

Right now getting a fix is more important that paying basic bills, or picking up the phone when family calls.... So here's to being honest. I don't think I can quit, I think it's gonna be the hardest thing I've ever had to do, and possibly will ever have to do. But I'm going to f\*\*king try anyway.

I'm not even really sure why, but it can't hurt. I've been smoking for over 30 years, more or less. I stopped drinking about 2 years ago, and my cannabis consumption skyrocketed. I've generally been smoking 4-6 times a day, all day, every day for about 2 years. First thing in the morning, last thing at night. I quit cold turkey 4 days ago, well almost 4 days. It will be 4 full days around 10pm tonight, lol. Crazy how I'm counting the hours.

Like so many others, I've tried moderation (never works, always regress back to chronic use). I've tried quitting entirely, obviously never worked. The last 4 days have been awful, I've lost almost 10 lbs, I am nauseous all the time (getting slightly better, at least not constant). My sleep is terrible, though no dreaming yet. (I'm curious why that might be since it seems an almost universal symptom when quitting chronic use.) I'm irritable and SO depressed. I've started seeing a counselor; I've been twice already, but that was before I quit. I'm going back on Tuesday. I started seeing the counselor because I am miserably unhappy so much of the time. I hope that is all a consequence of drug use, but I strongly suspect that there is underlying depression/anxiety/who knows what that I've been ""medicating"" through drugs and alcohol forever.   


To top it all off, I feel so stupid to be struggling like this. The reality is that I have a great job, nice house, nice car, beautiful family, but it seems I have no joy in my life. I can't seem to muster up any happiness, joy, whatever and it makes me feel even more terrible (and guilty, in a way), because in general, I have it fucking great. 

So, just wanted to write that all out. I'm quitting. But, I hate everything right now. So, yeah...

Initially it was something that gave me comfort through tough times as a kid. Back when I felt hopeless; before I could seek mental health for my issues. When my home life wasn't so great, I could have a quick toke and all of a sudden I'd stop crying and the gravity of the situation wasn't so extreme. It kept me holding on through tough times. It was almost magic. It made my severe depression and suicidal thoughts wash away. 

Now in my late 20s dealing with my second missed miscarriage in a year, a lack of friends, and my father passing away in the hospital this past Tuesday; I don't know where to turn. My immediate reaction was to come home and vape my strongest extracts and pair it with a few shots of alcohol to try and temporarily suppress the flood of emotions. I don't even care if I totally destroy my life right now. I feel like I have no reason to want to continue being a part of this world. Even though I now have some of the support I need (cognitive behavioural therapy, medication, and a psychiatrist), I still rely on weed every minute of my life. I've been good at trying to not to get high while at work (I am a nuclear chemist and my mind is busy at work), but as soon as my shift if over all I can think of is numbing my mind from the stresses of real life.

A few years ago I found out my step father had been abusing my underage sister for years, and it absolutely broke me. I literally had to run to throw up listening to what has been going on. I felt sadness and sympathy for my sister, along a burning rage to want to inflict the most pain a person has ever felt on my step dad. I was in a real dark place for a very long time. My sister initially confided in me and after a couple weeks of thinking what my next move would be, I decided to break the news to my mom in hopes she would banish him from the home. Instead she minimises the totality of the situation and tells me she wished I never told her. She would rather continue living this dream or ignorance while her daughter suffers. Somehow I'm the bad one here, not my stepfather. Needless to say, this absolutely nuked my family life and in that moment I felt truly alone. Since then my sister has developed serious drug and alcohol addictions and her and I don't speak much anymore. Ironically she works as a social worker at a women abuse shelter now. Day after day I replay all these traumatic events on my mind wondering how I could change things. Ultimately I find myself coming to the same conclusion, that I'm simply damned if I do and damned if I don't. I'd get scolded for my actions no matter what.

Now when I look back on my life I can finally see how withdrawn I've become from the world. I have no interest in doing anything and have lost the few friends I had in the process. Worst of all is that my heaving weed use has affected my relationship with my fiance. She has been my rock and has supported me for years. I honestly don't know how she puts up with it when I'm such a giant source of negativity. She deserves so much better. We were actually supposed to get married tomorrow, but because of the pandemic we had to reschedule and that's been tough on her having just gone through another miscarriage as well. The worst part is that because I'm so consumed with my own issues, I feel as though I'm not providing her the same support she gives me. 

All of this has brought me to where I am today. A person who cannot control the urge to escape reality. The weed went from this nice just in case drug to a crutch and in my opinion it is making all of my mental health issues worse. I honestly can't think of a single reason why I want it, yet I constantly find myself coaching myself no to give in to the cravings. With the rise and ease of vaping it is harder than ever to quit. Instead of being hooked on some 20% THC Purple K flower, now my brain is relying on nothing less than 95% THC in these disposable vape/shatter pens that I can easily bring with me wherever I go. I live in Ontario and it has never been easier to get a hold of quality bud. I have used plenty of drugs like molly, cocaine, speed, alcohol, and cigarettes and truthfully this is the hardest to quit. I think I was more cautious of the harder drugs and never abused them, but the mindset that weed is harmless allowed it to become so deeply ingrained with who I am as a person now. I was a pack a day smoker for years and managed to finally quit cold turkey last Jan 1st, and I tell you it was a lot easier that quitting weed. Today is probably around my 10th attempt at quitting over the last couple years, and I hope it works. 

Yesterday I was googling ways to try and stop smoking weed, and all I came across these reddit feeds filled with people reporting the same feelings and situations as my own. It actually made me happy to know that I wasn't crazy in thinking I have an addiction to weed. Some people have simply told me its just weed, all you gotta do is not smoke it. As though it is actually that simple.

I guess that's pretty much my story right now. If there's anyone out there feeling the same way or going through similar trials and tribulations, give a shout out. If anyone knows of any great places to chat with other people trying to quit, please suggest them to me. As I said, I don't have any family or friends to go to for help right now, so if there are fellow redditors willing to extend an olive branch, it would be greatly appreciated. Even if it was almost like a pen pal thing. I need all the help I can get if I'm going to make this work and pull myself out of the darkness. And for those who have made it this far in my post, thanks for taking the time out of your day to hear me out. Cheers to you and your family during these tough times.

Much Love,

Back around New Years, I decided that I wanted to get clean off of drugs, and made it my resolution. I had dropped out of college just under a year prior to that because my weed and nicotine addictions had spiraled out of control- I was wasting money I didn't have and borrowing it from my parents, getting into debts that ultimately stressed me to think about well after I paid them back, and neglecting my hygiene, social life, hobbies, and education to get stoned.

Over the course of January to February I was able to quit nicotine, which I haven't relapsed on since. But that accomplishment in my mind is vastly overshadowed by the fact that all the resources I freed up immediately went to my weed habit. I started smoking more and harder than I had been even at college, despite having even less stressors. The result has been almost two years of being consistently stoned, leading to chest and throat pains that are actually slightly concerning to me. And nothing much changed after leaving college- I still struggled to deal with my health, hygiene, and social life, trying to use weed as a panacea for it all. It's finally reached the point where, having made the plans I did for the summer and the rest of the year, I truly understand now that the only 'right time' is the time that I choose, and that if I want to fulfill my plans and my original resolution, that I've got to move forward with quitting. It's just not fun having weed in my life anymore. Even if it takes longer than the rest of the year, I'm going to take control of my own life again, one day at a time.",2

If I didn’t have weed, I’d spend the whole day trying to figure out how to get some. But I want to be free of the need for something that can be *sooo* pricey and so draining of my energy. 

I do have one problem, however. I’m a woman and I’m already very skinny (from only eating like one meal a day because I’m broke and bought weed instead) so I already wasn’t eating much to begin with. But the past few days since I’ve stopped smoking I *never* have an appetite. But I know I need to eat so I try to make meals and force myself to eat but I can only get 3 or 4 bites in before I feel like throwing up! This has happened with every meal the past few days.

2020-05-28 06:37:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gs3viy/tips_for_mood_and_sleep_during_abstinence_based/,Tips for mood and sleep during abstinence based recovery,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

I've compiled this little list here as a bunch of tips to help anyone who's struggling with mood and sleep. Please feel free to add.

&#x200B;

1. Take this opportunity to fix your diet and learn what your body loves. We're all different.

&#x200B;

Keep away from sugars (especially liquid) and junk food. If you're irritable and struggling with sleep regulating your blood sugar should be priority. Try and keep away from candy and white carbs for a while.

Eat high fiber, complex carbs, (brown pasta/rice, wholemeal bread etc) as well as fruits, veg and make sure you are getting your daily B vitamins, fatty acids (omega 3), magnesium, iron, zinc and calcium. Not only have the vitamins and minerals shown to directly combat depression but regulating your blood sugar and carb intake will avoid spikes throughout the day lessening the mood issues and making it much easier to sleep in the evening.

&#x200B;

2. Don't sleep in, if you're tossing and turning in the morning just get up.

&#x200B;

Struggling to sleep can be really tough but the worse thing you can do is allow yourself to stay in bed and further confuse your sleep pattern. Set an alarm, get up a few hours before you start work. Some meditate, some read, some work out. It will be rough at first, being tired and then dealing with negative emotions is not pleasant but confronting this can be extremely beneficial. While you may be sleeping less still, you are in control and the power of this is incredible.

&#x200B;

3. Replace your routine.

&#x200B;

If you've been a relatively heavy user, you're not only giving up a substance you're also giving up a lifestyle and a routine. This is really what undoes most of us! Find something constructive, whether it is helping others here, writing a book, studying, working out and so on.

The goals are twofold here. Firstly, you give yourself an opportunity to set small, realistic goals that you can achieve in a task (like education or body change etc) which is great for self esteem and life in general. Secondly, we need to avoid downtime. Set yourself up for success by allocating your time in advance and truly engaging with the task. Avoid the void.

&#x200B;

4. Talk or write, even to yourself.

&#x200B;

Self authoring is an incredibly potent technique for management of your psychy. Write your situation, your goals, your feelings and everything in between. If you don't like to write or type, talk instead! The key here is to be honest to yourself.

This doesn't need to be public as the goal is to understand yourself though in my personal experience it is a lot more beneficial when there is somebody to offer acknowledgement or response. The reality here is that we all, heavy users more so, build a false reality in our minds.

Who we are, what we like and want, how we feel about things and what our goals are can be terribly corrupted by years of use to the point where you genuinely believe you have and want things that aren't actually important to you. One of the first steps of recovery is reclaiming your 'self'.

Once we understand we are reclaiming our self, each anxious day, while a challenge, is a step towards ultimate recovery and self ownership.

&#x200B;

5. Exercise!!!!!!!!!

&#x200B;

Not only does physical activity release endorphins, naturally improving mood and sense of well being but it will tire you naturally. Perhaps set goals, get yourself doing a little more every day. Make yourself physically tired and you will soon enough find sleep.

Even if you are at the height of physical fitness, keep going.

&#x200B;

6. Stop looking for that kind of 'tired'

&#x200B;

This is the most important tip I can possibly give. If you're like me and you've been using at high quantities for some time, you will be used to laying down in bed and loosing consciousness almost instantly. That's not being tired, that's being intoxicated and it isn't the same.

Stop looking for that blackout feeling where you have no choice but to give in to the sleep. Natural tiredness, even up to quite an extreme level, allows you the option to sleep, not the necessity that cannabis will have you accustomed to. We all need to understand that being asleep and unconscious is not the same.

This is a really powerful revelation, at least for me. We need to make peace with the idea that you can be tired without verging on unconsciousness and to try and make peace with the fact that sleep may be difficult. Be at peace. If you can't sleep? Be tired tomorrow. If you can't sleep again? Be tired the next day.

Eventually you will sleep.

Long post, hopefully it helps someone to read it as much as it helped me to write it :)",9
2020-05-28 05:58:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gs3dzo/_/,😃,"Hello to everyone who's trying their very best to quit!

I did smoke weed for about 6 years in my life, it got me through college, landed me a very promising job, and I met my girlfriend who doesn't find weed that enjoyable but supports me in everything that I do. 

It's my 5th day off, not having thc in my body, I substitute it with a lot of alcohol. I drink a lot to just pass out and wake up the next morning.

I felt like a big part of who I am was gone. All the positivity of my daily life just vanished. I am more of a serious type right now, Im not mad, sad, or anything Im just this overthinking, not so smiling guy. As I've read few of the stories here in r/leaves I soon realized that MAYBE I'm just so addicted to the feeling of being high that I didn't knew who I really was, or I was neglecting personal growth thru fogging my emotions with weed. Im not an art person guy, just a regular one who likes to go to work stoned, and because of that Im actually productive. I make good money out of the motivation it gives me. It became my friend that whenever I try to face something difficult I ran to it, get high, then *puff* everything seems to be in ""it will all work out"" attitude.

Now that Im off weed, it makes me think of who I really am/was. It's crazy because I get in-touch with reality or the ""new"" me and I absolutely don't like it or not for now. And here I am, debating to myself to why I should smoke weed again.",5
2020-05-28 04:19:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gs285r/depression/,depression???,"hey everyone, I’ve been following this sub for a little bit but only quit 5 days ago so have been going through some pretty shitty times the past few days. Normally when I try to stop the only main withdrawal symptom is insomnia but the past few days have been hell.

Extreme nausea to the point of nearly vomiting, mood swings like NOTHING else (my boyfriend deserves a fkn medal) but the thing that’s bothering me most is I feel like absolute shit. No prospects for the future, nothing to be excited about, literally just down in the dumps sad.

I’ve used on and off for 4 years, my longest off time being about 8 months when I first got together with my boyfriend. I guess I had the excitement then of a new relationship so I didn’t miss it at all. I started back up again a few months ago and fell into it hard; cones as soon as I woke up, cones before work, I was constantly high basically. I decided that wasn’t who I wanted to be, I wasn’t achieving any goals I have or even making progress towards them, I care about my body and am even thinking about children and how me ruining my body now could ruin someone else’s life in the future (I mean my body is going to be someone’s home one day...). Basically I’m the worst version of myself when I’m smoking and I know that, so I’m quitting.

Now, 5 days sober I’ll admit I am happy that I’ve achieved what I have and I feel much clearer headed but that’s it. That’s all I’m mildly happy about. Everything else seems so SHIT. I don’t want to work out (I am forcing myself too tho), don’t want to see friends, have nothing I’m excited about (even though I should; plans have been put on hold yes but I have holidays that will go ahead after all this bullshit, I’m close to finishing a degree, I have an AMAZING boyfriend who means the absolute world to me but I’m not even excited to hang out with him).

I guess my mind being clearer, having more time to sit with myself and my emotions has all contributed to me feeling pretty damn depressed. Basically I was just wondering if this is purely related to quitting and if others experience the same?

I know 5 days isn’t a long time, I think I’m just looking for reassurance and encouragement to be honest...",1
2020-05-28 02:33:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gs0zox/just_passed_a_month_with_no_smoking/,Just passed a month with no smoking,"So as the title suggests, yesterday was a month without smoking. 

I wanna start out by saying I'm not against smoking at all, but for me, at this point in life, I realized I was addicted to feeling good all the time and never feeling bad. 

While I've never really gotten overboard with substances to the point where im physically addicted, I noticed when I didn't have weed I'd do phenibut instead 2 times a week at most. 

While it was fine and doesn't give withdrawals, eventually my stomach started hurting and I suspected I might be developing an ulcer, so I decided nah this is actually hurting my body, mentally is one thing but I don't want to knowingly hurt myself physically. 

So decided to take a break and take a proton pump inhibitor daily so my stomach could heal, one week at first, noticed my stomach still hurt somewhat and I was still nauseous when I woke up. So one week turned into two, and now two into three without using phenibut each week. 

While it's hard at times it feels pretty good to be sober for a longer time, it was definitely needed as I realized being high on things clouded my mindfulness, so instead now when I feel anxious or sad I meditate a little, I've been meditating daily for about 6 months but honestly never relly did it when I was feeling down. 

So far mindfulness and meditation has been a nice substitute for being high! 

While I don't think this is a permanent break (for me, I have nothing against people who permanently stop smoking), next time I smoke I will definitely do it responsibly, to help with my symptoms on being on the spectrum as well as anxiety (but mostly to help me deal with my Aspergers since meditation helps with anxiety) instead of just wanting to get stoney baloney. 

If I can do it, I know anyone can.",3

Didnt think about PMC until now, gonna need another name for them. NF works. not that I will mention them again.

Was able to politely, honestly, and truthfully assert myself to the foodbank. Had never been able to do that before. If stoned, would just cower away, if sober (not quit) would just get extremely angry. They invited me to come in, and talk to them, and start setting up some times to volunteer. The big problem, is that It will have to wait.

Pretty sure the reason I'm completely dead during the day, is because of the dreams. They're not bad, just borderline lucid. vivid. More real than real life. Certainly more interesting. That said, im not sure how much more exploding heads, Cthulhu beasts, and gang wars I can take. Guess i should reiterate that In my dreams I am never myself, more like cinematic movies, where you see from not only from the eyes of the current character, but in third person... with feeling, taste, smell, sound.

At one point, I would have intense, again not nightmares, enough dreams that I would stay awake for days smoking, until i couldnt remember them or feel the sensations they left, just so i would be safe to sleep. 

Interestingly, since I quit smoking, I have yet to have sleep paralysis, or have my larnyx collapse. Im guessing it had to do with the amount i was smoking causing my throat to swell, so even the smallest relaxation of muscle could cause the airway to clog. Thats just speculation though.

Ah well. 

I seriously got to stop talking about running, and start doing it. Ugh I just dont have the energy. Up at 5, feel tired, fall asleep in the afternoon, wake up for second group, tired as fuck, sit around doing nothing until bed.

That despite the fact that 1) I had a dream last night of walking through some dingy, dirty streets and speaking to some shady af people just to get 30 grams and 2) Yesterday I had a terrible panic attack followed by a crying fit. The second part matters because I have anxiety and I’ve been smoking for several years to ease my mind. Nothing like weed to stop a panic attack in its tracks.

It all seems a bit surreal. I’ve wanted to quit for a long time. My psychiatrist has been behind my ass to do so. And also, every time I got hyper when I didn’t have any weed, I wondered if it was worth it to let a substance have so much power over me. So while I did make excuses to my dealer.. the thought that went through my mind at that point was.. I don’t feel the need for it. It’s quite amazing to be this clear headed. I’m proud and again, quite shocked.

That said, I still long for a joint sometimes... to feel that high or just shut my mind for a little while. I still wonder if I could just make it a “weekend thing”. But for now I’m happy that I’m not having a meltdown just to get my hands on a bag of grass. Yay me!",10

Here are some midnight thoughts on why marijuana addiction can be so difficult to accept and even harder to let go of :

-When it comes to other drugs and alcohol, the altered state we're in is quite distinguishable. More often than not, you're not in control of your actions, but at some level, you are still aware of them. With marijuana, on the other hand, that altered state starts becoming your **reality.** Most of us smoke multiple times in a day, making the addiction more ingrained in our sense of self.

-This is where it all messes up. Our sober, normal self becomes our *altered self.* Why would you want to do something sober when you can be high and flow with it instead? For example, you want to have pizza but ofcourse you won't have it sober because it's so much better when you're high. 

-The main problem : your personality. I read somewhere that one of the hidden dangers of heavy marijuana use is the **paralysis of personality development.** A big reason I fell in love with marijuana is because of how creative it made me, how much more I could enjoy my hobbies, etc. So I started using it regularly before writing or painting. Again, that's where it all messed up. It went like - more pot = more art, no pot = no art, and slowly just pot and no art. I used to see this as a writer's block before I finally realised.

-We don't realise how covertly marijuana takes over our hobbies, traits and overall personality. We end up never finding who we really are, because we equate ourselves with the intoxicating effects of pot or with the withdrawal symptoms of it. 

-Although I do see how other drugs also block personality development, but the reason this one is so much more difficult to accept is because we never really see it as a problem. We don't see it as an escape from reality, we see it as reality itself. 

Do you all agree? Tell me about your POV on this :)

I was really worried all day about withdrawals, my mood, and anxiety. In the past when I've tried to ""cut back"", I've experienced insomnia, night sweats and a nasty temper.

I had my first video session with my therapist at 7am and I came out of that meeting with things to try. I avoided caffeine, drank lots of water throughout the day, and exercised for 10 minutes in the afternoon. My wife and I did a little ceremony after work and destroyed my pipes, composted two joints, and threw away my paraphernalia. In the evening, I tried some new sleep hygiene including avoiding screen time 1 hour before bed, took a relaxing shower, did some light stretching, and ate a melatonin gummy. To my surprise, I didn't have difficulty falling asleep (and I always have trouble falling asleep) and only woke up once due to night sweats.

In the morning, I woke up refreshed and clear headed. I can't remember the last time I felt like this! I'm still worried about what's ahead, so does anyone have advice on what I should expect in the coming days/weeks/months? Any advice for someone in the first days of going cold turkey?",4

i stopped 88 days ago because i was going to be looking for jobs. also there were a lot of negative effects to me smoking such as anxiety, paranoia, and being too content with just staying inside my apartment all day.

the first few weeks were the toughest but it gradually got easier. recently i've been having more cravings and catch myself trying to justify using again. 

i actually have a degree from a good university and solid work experience but am not expecting to get a job offer or drug tested anytime soon. or i try to justify to myself that if i smoke just once every couple of weeks that it will get out of my system quickly. but i know that i'm just lying to myself and that it could easily become a daily habit again if i give in.

so far i'm clean. 88 days clean and i'm proud of myself. i'm proud of you too.

times are crazy right now. i'm tired of being cooped up all day without much to do. part of me thinks that weed might make it a little better just chillin inside. i try to stay active by going on hikes but there's only so much i can do right now and feel pretty limited. i live alone but have a good support system. i quit my job before the corona outbreak and i know there was no way to predict this happening and you can't have regrets, but damn i really hope things work out. i'm sure other people are in worse situations and we're all struggling right now. things will get better, don't lose hope. sometimes i'm too selfish thinking about me all the time, and when i think about others and do something nice for them i feel better. i'm also tired of people talking about covid and seeing it everywhere and am sorry for bringing it up here.

something happens, i don't know. it's like after some months clean my brain really starts to rewire, i start feeling better than ever, truly happy. but an opposing force appears too, the force that makes me miss the smoking days. i know i felt like shit when i smoked, i know it made me got away from people i cared about. but emotionally i'm missing it. i live near someone that i could buy it from, and it's taking all my will to not do it.

I've been through the dumb stage of going out and taking MDMA, stuff like that, and I've never been one that likes alcohol much. I'm 24 so the fact I don't do anything but smoke is not so bad but I've used that fact as something to enable my habit one too many times. 
I wouldn't even smoke more than 2g a day, but it's still such a crutch and it feels like while being addicted my life is on pause. I now feel like I have enough motivation to kick it and to be honest the lockdown is helping, as is this subreddit. Seeing people's own stories is motivational beyond belief, however I know it'll be an arduous task staying off it for good, but it's severely gotten in the way of my enjoyment for everyday hobbies, as in without it I feel disinterested in most things, but the past 2 days have been surprisingly decent without it.

I'm kinda new here. I've been lurking and following people on and off for quite some time but it's the first time i've really had cause to post. 

I am two days into quitting buds (again). Until two days ago i'd smoke around 7g per day, averaging about 5 oz per month. I had started to notice some flickers of mental health issues recently and this combined with the cost proved enough to force my hand. Below I will diary daily my experiences and anything I have found that helps / hurts progress. With quarantine still in effect, this is proving to be incredibly more difficult than i'd experienced in the past and my hope is any help I can get here can be returned to whoever may be reading this.   


Day 1 -   


Morning was fine, nothing to report. From around 1pm, anxiety really started to hit home. Lots of pacing, fidgeting and restlessness. Real difficulty in engaging with anything, colors insignificant,   
 favorite songs boring and so on. Found myself using the washroom constantly. Often feeling as though you desperately need the toilet and end up sitting there for 15 mins for nothing.  Appetite was non-existent all day. I turned to alcohol in the evening to try and encourage it but unfortunately could only manage a sandwich. I thought the rum would help me get to sleep but sleep was virtually impossible and even when it did happen i'd find myself waking up every 30 mins and feeling as though I hadn't been asleep at all. 

&#x200B;

Day 2 -   


Very little sleep the night before. Slightly hungover / confused and awoke to an impending sense of doom. Paranoia and anxiety from the get go. One coffee seemed to send my mind racing. Again constant sensation as though the washroom is needed. Appetite was better, managed to eat food around 1pm. Managed to eat dinner at 6pm. Getting good healthy food really helps manage the anxiety/depression/paranoia. Once again pacing around aimlessly all day doing laps of my condo. Green tea is much nicer than coffee right now, keeps you awake but is also somewhat calming on the nerves. Boredom is a real problem today and it has been incredibly hard not to relapse though i'm starting to understand that I do not actually crave being high or the taste, simply the ability to enjoy whatever task is at hand and engage into something.   


So far the biggest struggle is occupying time productively in a way that is satisfying. Without work and social interactions the downtime is the biggest enemy allowing thoughts to run wild, doubt to drop in and so on. The biggest tip I can provide for this so far is to just talk to somebody. Tell them your issue and what your goal is and explain why you are finding it hard right now. Putting things into words seems to really help me understand exactly where it is that I am, where it is I need to be and how I plan to get there.   


The thing to remember is this: It isn't easy. Don't be too hard on yourself but don't make excuses for yourself either. Learn, don't blame.

This is encouraging, because in the beginning it can feel like the depression is never going to end.

Every night since Day 1 though, I’ve dreamed that I’m either smoking or taking an edible. It’s insane how my brain still craves smoking even in my sleep. The dreams are also insanely vivid and sometimes scary, but I know this is a normal part of withdrawal.

I can’t say that Day 7 is the day when everyone will start feeling joy again, I’m sure it is different for anyone. But just know that if you’re super depressed and feel like you can’t stop crying, your brain is healing itself. If you have obsessive thoughts or OCD came back with a vengeance as it did for me, don’t take the thoughts too seriously, and use thought-stopping techniques.

I’m now only smoking when I’m really up to, but I don’t need it anymore. A year ago I couldn’t even imagine a life without a doobie every two hours.. I oftentimes smoked about 2-3g a day and felt miserable and started smoking even more. But by beginning to think about life and my personal goals, the inner motivation to quit smoking started to raise. I think it’s essential to ask yourself why you want to quit smoking and getting to know yourself better.. For me, there’s always a reason why someone has such enormous issues to stop. Most of us are desperately trying to escape from something, but in order to make things better, you have to face your problems and work on yourself or even your environment.

I had my final year uni exams not too long ago and it was one of the biggest reasons why I have stopped smoking in the first place as I wanted to do well in them (I knew if I continued smoking every day my chance of getting good grades would be a lot smaller). Other reasons included money, wanting to get rid of that cloudy head and just wanted to do something more with my life as I've basically finished uni and have to look for a job.

I'm at my uni accommodation for the last week now and I've been really trying to stay busy by making some money online (matched betting), going for long walks, eating healthy etc. However, I haven't really been able to relax and my urges to have a smoke been increasing recently. It's definitely because my exams have finished and I dont have that feeling that ""I cant smoke because I will do worse in my exam"".

My other reason for having a smoke is that, it is my last week at university and I won't get this opportunity for a very long time. I've smoked a lot over these 3 years and I really want to go to my favourite spot, spark a spliff and end this uni journey the way it started.

Although, I'm really worried that if I do pick up it wont end on smoking just ""one time"" as I used to abuse it quite a lot. I would hate myself to go back to my old habits and I know I would feel guilty for breaking my streak. Yet I still want to have that one last smoke for ending uni.

Here’s my personal experience with regards to the yin-yang associated with long term smoking. 
I was an avid smoker. High every single day for 4 years. Didn’t question it. Medical student as well. Couldn’t go a day without smoking. I acknowledged i was dependent on weed to bring me back to normalcy, but couldn’t fathom the idea of stopping smoking. Would go through 20g of hash in a couple of days. 
That is until I had to travel abroad to continue my education. I decided I would not actively look for a source near my new place, and the ball just kept rolling from there. There were no withdrawals ( kept myself busy through studying and getting to know new places for the first couple of weeks) and from then on it was as if I have never smoked in my life.
Don’t get me wrong. I did not quit. Every end of semester when i go back to my country for the break, i would resume my old habits. Can’t even go one day without smoking during said vacation. So this has been going on for the past 2 years, and it feels awesome. I do crave the bud sometimes, but i just got myself used to this routine that I automatically switch personas when i board the plane. Stoner back home, sober as fuck abroad. 
This has made me realize that besides it being “in your head”, its nothing but merely breaking habits and building new ones not associated with smoking. 
I guess im lucky in being able to physically be in another place which helps me click that mental “smoke/no smoke” switch, otherwise i reckon it would be tough. 
For my homies struggling with letting go of the bud, try to find your own ticket abroad, albeit in your brain.
I got one month left of this semester, and I would be going home to endless sessions of smoking, and countless fatties. But now i know that once september 1st arrives, letting go would be as easy as throwing out a chewing gum that had lost its taste.",5

I’ve been through the loop for years. Quit for two weeks, feel better, think I can handle it again, start smoking only at certain times.....cmon we all know that doesn’t last. So I would sit there at night and wonder how I’m going to beat this thing cause clearly I wasn’t taking the right approach. Well, I went to the point that’s really scary to do.....I conceded myself to the people around me. I told my parents, my roommate, really anyone I know I could trust. I’m also going to rehab, but that’s not something everyone has to do. What I’ve found to really help is the outlet of music and not just any music. Music from artists that CAN relate to our situation. I’m talking artists such as Kid Cudi, Macklemore, DMX, T.I., NF, even Eminem. Try to stick to the positive songs though. Songs such as “Heart of a Lion” by Kid Cudi or “Victory Lap” by Macklemore. FORSE FEED YOURSELF POSITIVITY. Rewire your brain to feed yourself positivity without a drug. Love yourself. Embrace the struggle. One day we will all look back at where we are now, compared to where we were and just be amazed at what you CAN do without a drug.

I called it ""procrastinate on cravings"" -- mental trick: I'd feel a craving to smoke, then tell myself, ""I'll do ________ first. Then I can smoke if I feel like it."" After doing the distracting activity (ideally involving physical activity) the craving would have passed most of the time. If I was still craving, I'd repeat the process. It was as though I learned to game the addict voice in my head. I'd convince my craving mind that I really would smoke later, just after doing X, Y, Z. Thanks to this technique I have not had a single toke since 2006. And that was after smoking weed since I was a teenager until age 33.",6

I live in Oregon so weed is rampant. When I'm walking down the street and smell it I can't get it out of my head and it's just the best thing I've ever smelled, when my bf hits the pipe or the bong I need to as well, not just want, but it's a need. Tonight was the first night he hit the pipe and I managed to not hit it as well, considering the fact I smoked some high THC stuff a couple days ago and am terrified to throw up. 

It's incredibly hard to go cold turkey even though I really need to. For the past few years I've seen myself as a stoner, that's what I banked my whole identity on. Now I feel like I've had a piece of who I was ripped away and beaten the hell up.

Its been 2 days since i last smoked. Im use to being high almost 24/7. Almost. Absolutely everyday. Bu evening time its full force. Smoke myself stupid, munch on bad food. Pass out and do it all again after work. Well i was actually doing better before covid-19. I was only doing it at night before bed. But now its all the time to fight bordem. Thats the main reason i smoke. Boredom. And it helps me “relax”. Sometimes.

Anyway, i guess why i came here is for some encouragement that this is the right path. I have nobody to talk to who can relate. All my friends are stoners and dont wanna give it up. I even bought cbd only weed and they say “why would you waste money on somthing that doesnt get you high. My girlfriend (whom i live with) is amazing but doesnt understand addiction or what im dealing with. And the poor girl is having a hard time with my mood swings, irritability etc. 

Im going threw such a bad withdrawal. I cant believe how i feel. I feel alienated, alone, scared, cold, tired, not myself. Constantly crying during the day. How could this happen from stopping WEED. Its WEED. I expected this from hard drugs. Not weed. Im a mess guys. My “cons” list for quitting is sooooo big and “pros” is basically nothing. Im addicted and dependant i get that.

I guess im scared to give it up because its part of me as stupid as that sounds. Its how ive made friends, its what i do to pass the time. When im sad, when i cant sleep or cant eat etc. All my friends smoke, my parents smoke. My girlfriend only smokes because of me and to help her sleep. But shes giving it up since i have. (As im the reason she started) 

I dont know what im asking from you guys. Im just so lost and thought i could come here for help... im so tempted to take a toke tonight from the pipe not bong, before bed. I cant go another restless sleepless night. I cant handle this feeling. I feel weak. Im sorry for the complaining and rambling everyone. Im just feeling really down and out.

Im so proud of the people i see who have gone months without it. So proud. You guys are awesome. I hope ill be there one day. But do i really want that? I don’t know. I miss it already. Please help.

This is the longest period I have gone since I started smoking about twelve years ago, I'm 30 btw.  I was a daily user for the vast majority of those 12 years.  Many of those years I was mixing weed with tobacco which caused me to blaze way too much weed.  It got to the point where I would smoke multiple spliffs a day and barely feel the high which is fucked.  

I quit tobacco 6 months ago but continued smoking weed daily until late March.  The weed shops in my state closed at the beginning of covid which was probably a blessing in disguise.  The shops just reopened this week and I thought I wouldn't be able to resist getting ""just one pre-roll"" but I know I can't at this point.  I know I should feel good about being off weed and tobacco but all I keep thinking about is the time and money I've wasted over the years being an isolated stoner.

Started smoking at 15, which allowed me to bond with my brother who I had never really gotten along with before that. I turn 40 this summer - been a daily smoker for roughly 20 years. I had a ""come to Jesus"" moment in my life (Summer 2018), quit for several months. Christmas rolls around and my wife, who smokes, has pot in the house. I'm like, ""Can we get high and wrap presents?"" We did; had a ton of fun, but (of course) started smoking every day again; quit again in January 2019.

Wife is a cancer patient in remission with a lot of physical pain. MMJ is available, so she gets her card (Summer 2019). Now it's in the house again, and I eventually start smoking (August 2019), which once again turns into every day, and now I'm here nearly a year later.

It's the worst it's ever been right now - dabs all day from minute one of being awake. I don't think there's anything wrong with weed, I don't think there's anything wrong with my wife using weed as a medicine for her physical conditions, but god fucking damnit if it's in my house right now I'm going to smoke.

I guess I'm reaching out because some part of me is ready to be done, even if I'm not strong enough to do it all by myself, and that's ok. I don't have to be strong enough by myself, because there's an amazing community of fellow human beings who have been through similar experiences and can provide support. So I guess what I'm saying is (tl;dr):

2- r/leaves. When I commented about my addiction and withdraws with close friends, they used to say to me that you cannot be addicted on weed, weed do no harm to you etc. That used to make me feel insecure, and I aways returned to smoking.

So the last couple of years have been quite hard on my sleep. I wake up multiple times in the early morning and sometimes can't get back to sleep (I can usually sleep a full 8 hours if there is nothing to get up early for. This puts my mind at ease as I can always set my alarm later if I have troubles). I've actually quit my internship partially because of this. I like smoking weed, as do a lot of people but I have no idea if this is what is causing it. During my internship I would only smoke in the weekends (usually evenings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday). No crazy amounts, like 1 or 2 joints that are 40% weed with tobacco. I have actually quit multiple times for a few weeks to 2 months max and it didn't really do much for my sleep quality (still waking up multiple times in the morning). It doesn't seem to matter, but I still don't know what to do. Now that I don't have a job or internship during the covid pandemic I do smoke a bit more out of boredom. I actually did a sleep study today (stopped smoking weed 2 weeks before), but I have no idea if it will yield results because I barely slept because of the heat in my room and anxiety for the study. Not cool of my brain to turn on me like that..
Do you think the weed has something to do with my sleep problems? Or could it be something else? I'm not really anxious while in bed, because I don't have responsibilities at the moment, but I still wake up a lot :/ I also don't think it's sleep apnea because I don't wake up during my deep sleep and I'm not gasping for air or something. I actually think it could be caused by hyperthyroidism (I don't have any diagnostis on that but will ask my doctor).

I thought, weed was such a mild drug, these people are clearly overreacting. It's like having a caffeine addiction forum. I'm a person who is interested in drugs but is also very cautious of neurological consequences of said drug use. Because of conflicting studies and lack of research in the field, it's reasonable to conclude there isn't any strong evidence to imply significant mental decline, but we definitely know it isn't something the adolescent brain wants continued interaction with, and generally v heavy smokers wind up losing a handful of IQ points, but to be fair that's because heavy smokers as a demographic maybe has some other stuff going on. I didn't realize how hard or soft the drug was isn't really what matters when it comes to forming a *debilitating* addiction. 

I love that weed saves me from the prison of my reality, I love the renewed feeling of interest I feel for everything around me when I'm high, I love the feeling of contentedness it invokes in me. My rule was that weed is for mandatory downtimes, the waiting rooms of life so to speak. This lockdown is the perfect example. I mean fuck if they want to end prison riots and violence just let them smoke up all they want and they wouldn't ever leave. My problem was that most rooms in life I thought of as waiting rooms, my entire job turned into a big waiting room in my head and so I was hitting cartridges in the work stall and smoking right before work and immediately after, making myself late sometimes because ""I would be miserable without it."" And it got bad, I got written up for it, I had done it 10+ times by that point, and I would just come in whenever I felt like it. High, of course.

I finally realized, if I'm miserable I can't just put it off and hide behind a pipe. That misery hasn't gone away, it's dormant and growing. If I'm in a waiting room, there's a million better things to do than this perverse ritual of mental masturbation. Being an everyday smoker, a lot of the time I just found myself in a mental fog. There was a smokescreen around my entire life, I now realize. I was living a silent hill game. I went to work and did good work, I paid my rent and bills, I stayed on top of the fundamentals with ease, anything that's easy and natural to you sober you can do high. But you can't grow if you're only doing familiar things. You won't want to if you feel content all of the time. I started to let the smoke clear and I finally saw beyond. I finally took another crack at coding after probably 6 years, and it was going really well, I was learning a lot, improving way more quickly with the guitar, and diving deep into classic literature and philosophy. Then, I bought weed after coming into some money and I haven't touched anything in a month. Have you ever tried to learn heavy academic material high? It sucks, don't even try it. I especially can't because I'm attempting to go full autodidact.

I've been at this point so many times before. It's hard to really quit. Weed is a lot like eating unhealthy. We can let ourselves do this sometimes, but the more often you do, the greater chance that it'll be all you'll want to eat. Everytime you eat junk, you've missed out on a beneficial and nutritious meal, and you'll have to do *more work* to get to where you would have been if you **just ate healthy**. Junk food will never stop tasting good, it will taste good every single day while you are eating healthy. You just have to look past the smoke at what's ahead of you, not what's immediate.",4

There I was back in October six months pot free. I made the choice to quit that prior April after someone I respect smelled weed in me car. I was embarrassed and drew the line. No more weed for me. Then I made the same fatal mistake many others do, I thought I was in control. One weekend I bought a joint (doesn't help I live in a state where recreational pot is legal). That puff after six months off brought a feeling of euphoria I remember vividly to this day. From there I started smoking just on weekends, and gradually progressed back to daily use after going into quarantine. That was in mid- March!

Now, I'm trying to quit again. Day 1 here we go. My body is entering its typical ""quit weed"" state of shock. I have a sleepless night ahead of me which will also include sweats and irritability. I can already feel that funny tingle in my shoulders I get when ceasing pot (does anyone else get it?). I'm glad it's a four day work week because the sooner I get to the weekend, the better. The sauna is my go-to during this time but the gym is closed (damn COVID)! I guess I'll take a hot shower tonight instead. Maybe that'll help. And, finally there's the reality of a future without smoking. I don't like that idea. I've been smoking my entire adult life (I'm 42). The thought of a future without weed seems agonizing.

However, I need to stop. My career is at an inflection point. I've done well to this point but I'm trying to get to another level; I think pot might be holding me back. Not sure, it could just be who I am at my core. Either way, I'm tired of wondering if anyone notices my black, chapped lips and glassy eyes. I'm tired of things I've wanted to do for years never happen because I've been too stoned to care. I'm tired of wondering if my neighbors can ""smell it"" (they can LOL!). You know guys know what it's like. Funny thing is I've for long periods before without it and the boredom is terrible. Finding a way to manage it is critical. For me I always fall into traps like, ""Saturday chores are done, bills are paid, house is cleaned and errands are complete, might as well smoke. I mean, I deserve a reward, right?""

Then it's all downhill. I'm asking this group to please keep me in mind as I try again to quit. Again, the boredom is going to kill me. I mean, I'm a guy who when he's not smoking sees the weekend as just another day/s. Sad but true. After quitting, things do get better overall but it's not the same. You will miss it. 

Anyway, in return for your kind thoughts, I'll come here and pour my heart out in the comments when I get cravings. Just kidding, happy to provide others the same support. 

Now I'm about to go shower.",2

This is the 3rd time now that I’ve gotten a ticket for marijuana. It’s a sign. For a while now I’ve been telling myself I should stop, but every time I ran out I would just go by more. It was an endless cycle. I was getting nowhere and I wasn’t the person I wanted to be. 
Now, this is the first full day I’ve gone without smoking in quite a while. I’m depressed, bored, and anxious. I hate being alive. Without weed, it feels like there is nothing else to do. I feel like I have nothing to live for. I would consider myself an addict. This isn’t healthy and I want to be better. I want to wake up everyday and not feel like I have to smoke. It’s so hard though and I don’t know what to do. Before I got it taken and decided enough is enough, there were so many things I wanted to do instead of smoking. I wanted to get into yoga and meditating. I had so many books I wanted to read. The only reason I wasn’t doing any of this was because I wanted to smoke all day instead. Now I’m not smoking, and I don’t even wanna do any of this anymore. I know it’s only day 1, but it’s really hard and I don’t see any of the other days being any easier.",8

We went and kicked a football (“soccer” ball) around and after went back to my friends to sit in the garden and soak up some sun. 

After a while, and those two smoking a couple more joints, my cravings were through the roof and I asked if I could buy a joint of one of my friends. 

He agreed but asked if I really wanted to and I said “one joint in a week compared to half ounce is still an improvement” I knew I was rationalising at the time but I didn’t care, I wanted to smoke. 

When we went in his garage to roll I decided I didn’t want to throw away the progress I had already made so I decided not to roll this joint and go home. 

What I’m not happy with is that moment of weakness where I gave into those cravings, I want to stop smoking and being the lazy douche I have been, but I also desperately want to smoke and that just makes me feel like shit. 

Not looking for any advice just wanted to vent to people who could maybe empathise.

I need to quit. I want to quit. I have a very hard time quitting, that is why I joined this subreddit. I’ve quit before, many times — one time for up to a year. I tend to be most successful once I can build up that first few weeks of momentum. In those first few weeks, it *really* helps if you’re not around anyone who is already smoking weed. After that, it’s easier to stay committed to the goal. Sadly, I’ve got some stoner roommates, I already know in the long run I need to move out.

I feel really unstoppable now and very confident, like never before, I believe it will be nothing to lose but many, if not all aspects of my life are´going to improve in ways I still do not know. I am ready to go through PAWS, depression, sleepless nights, boredom,night sweats . I know I can do it, as you do, I did it several times already,ya know, but then was like i did miss out something in life and of course drafted off course again, the never ending heavy smoking and doing nothing

NOW it will be soo worth finally quit cannabis and all addictions.  I know it is true, Life will get better without this secret burden that makes me only miserable, lonely, confused,frustrated, depressed etc

This time I feel completelly equipped to fight the green monster that ruined my life. I have the 99,999 certainty and capability to win.

Let me celebrate my newfound freedom with a delicious smoothie

I believe I will never, ever ever touch cannabis for the rest of my days, I will treat it as a medicine for people who really find health benefits but personally won´t rely on it to cure me anything except (hope will never be) the case of terminal or heavy sickness

Today is the first day of my cannabis free life, one day at a time

More like Friday, Saturday, Sunday night. All night.

It felt like a great little retreat. Come home from a long week and chill out with a bowl and beer. Watch a movie or game.

Once lockdown hit it picked up and I was smoking because eh, fuck it, what else is there to do?

The problem is that when I smoke I have zero impulse control. Stoned me doesn't ever do anything productive. I binge TV or games until I get hungry and raid the kitchen for stacks of junk food or cook a full meal at 1am. If it's not food that takes me from the computer chair, it'll be the urge to use porn (nothing against porn but it is absolutely detrimental to my mental and sexual health and I actively try to keep it out of my life). I started having issues with ED because I was using porn so much when I got high. I also had to be high just to get going.

Stoned me is sluggish and slow in social situations. When my friends are harmlessly talking shit I'd have nothing to shoot back with because my brain was too slow. I'd forget recent events and past events and have trouble keeping track of days.

I also found I was getting depressed and not enjoying things like video games and music while sober. The mindset was always *let's get high and watch this movie, let's get high and play this game, let's get high and listen to this new album.* Everything turned into an ""event"" where you get high to do things instead of enjoying a great movie/album/book/game/hangout for the value it offers without the aid of a drug.

I've been off weed for 2 weeks now, which I acknowledge is not a long time. But I already feel so much better. My sexual health and vitality feels so much better. I've been enjoying social interaction so much more and making my friends laugh more than I have in ages. 

Am I a perfect person with superhuman abilities and endless attention span now? No. But I think I'm on a path to becoming a better version of myself, and I think I've finally realized for good that weed doesn't have a place as a regularly used substance in my life.

Sorry for the ranty post - I felt like I needed to articulate some feelings I've been having lately and hopefully reading this can help someone realize why they could be better without weed.

Today marks the 99th day of my abstinence of weed. I've hit rough patches along the way and wanted to thank all the people posting their advice, sorrows and feelings about leaving weed behind.

The week before i quit, i smoked away 300 bucks. I quit my job at the end of last year and had a hard time motivating me to... well pretty much anything. From cleaning my room to going out for anything else but to buy food and weed, i just couldn't get my ass up. That's when i finally flipped the switch in my brain and came to see how my life will turn out if i stay on this path.

As i said, i've hit rough patches where i couldn't think about anything than lighting one up and i drowned those thoughts in alcohol. I've had many sleepness nights and times of restlessness but i am getting better with each day. Nothing is better than a sober and ""clean"" reality and i've come to really appreciate interacting with people around me and taking interests that don't just last a couple days. I love caring about things in and around me and to actually remember stuff i spoke about with other people. Walking through town and not seeing everything in this ""ignorant haze"" is a high in itself.

Sometimes it's hard to get over the fact that i finally **really** feel something again and yes, feelings of any kind can be overwhelming. I can't remember the last time i felt so much joy, happiness, interest, love, hope, anger, pain and sadness. The bad is always a part in all our lives, but it is our- each and everyones- duty, to take matters in our own hands to make the most out of our own lifes and enrich it with good things and feelings.

It is my responsibility- *and only mine*\- to make my life worth living

If you made it this far, thank you for reading and i wish you the very best on your own journey. Don't let life get you down.",7

I'm 29 years old and have been smoking daily since I graduated high school. Weed has been a huge part of my life and I've basically built my life around being able to smoke it at night. I've missed out on so many opportunities because they wouldn't allow me to smoke at night. 

I've always been a high functioning stoner. Although I'm slow, forgetful and lazy at times I've learned how to hide those traits and provide value wherever I am. Last week I received a very good job offer for nearly 6 figures. The highest salary anyone in my family has ever gotten. Admittedly, I was high when they called to congratulate me. 

After I hung up the phone I threw away all of my weed, bowls and grinders. I've been looking for an excuse to quit for three years but never did until now because, well, I'm an addict. 

Day 0: I smoked at 11am and got the call at noon. Not smoking for the rest of the day was really hard but trying to get to sleep that night was the hardest.

Day 1: I was hot and irritable all day. I would snap at my wife and yell at my dog when they did nothing wrong. I felt bad but thankfully my wife understood and didn't take it personally. At night I was hot and sweaty and got about 3 hours of sleep. 

Day 2: Still hot and irritable. My wife tried to keep me busy all day so I'd keep my mind off of weed but it didn't really work. I was tense and couldn't stop thinking of smoking. Still hot and sweaty at night but got about 6 hours of sleep.

Day 3: Nothing has changed. Still angry at everyone for no reason. Barely slept at night. 

Day 4: Somewhat less irritable but more ""empty."" I have depression but this felt different. I don't know how to explain it but I just felt like the shell of a human. First full 8 hour night of sleep.

Day 5 (today):I took a nap which I just woke up from. They say you have some weird dreams when you stop smoking pot but wow, I wasn't prepared for this. I was only asleep for two hours but the dream felt so much longer. I remember every strange detail which has never happened to me before. If I dream at all I usually forget what happened a few seconds after waking up. I woke up more refreshed than usual. I feel somewhat happy and I'm not angry or craving a bowl. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that, on day 5 I feel there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I know I'm not nearly home free but it feels somewhat manageable now. I feel like I'm in more control of myself while the symptoms are dissipating. 

I have been reading this subreddit ever since I decided to quit and didn't really find anyone in my exact situation. I hope my story gives others a little bit of hope and understanding of what to expect.",6

I was working, moving apartments, and hanging with friends. But the longer I go without weed, the easier I find it to convince myself that I could go back to the drug and not have it affect me the way it had in the past.

I started the show Waco on Netflix and its ehhh, but one thing that stuck out to me is the idea of short term suffering for a long term benefit. It's tough to justify the suffering in the moment, but once you have overcome it and see the long term benefits, you'll have realized it was worth it all along.

I'll be a week clean as of today from the reefer but I just wanted to talk about my addiction from smoking concentrates everyday for 2 years. I've smoked pot for 10+ years daily. Within those years, the concentrate industry blew up fast. It became the shit. If you weren't smoking shatter/concentrates, your weed would be considered boujee even though it would be top shelf. I got hooked on the high fast, faster than cannabis. For those who have never tried smoking concentrates, its a way more intense high. Straight to the dome type of high. Lay you on your ass type of high. It became so easy to get stoned out of your mind. I was taking dab after dab all day. I even got a portable wax device where you can load up a fat .2/.3 and the thing would vaporize it no problem. This is what I was smoking on the go everywhere I went. I was stoned 24/7 off this. When I decided to stop, the withdrawal was pretty severe. Although I was still smoking flower, I went through withdrawal from concentrates. It was intense. Night sweats/insomnia hit me hard. Lasted a week but no more than 2. Maybe because I was still smoking cannabis so it didn't last long but let me tell you, you can definitley withdrawal from it. Just wanted to put this out there so people are aware.

Thank you and stay strong.",2

I can deal with a month but I honestly don’t know if I can continue to live like this if it lasts any longer than a month or two. Im also naturally quite skinny so I’m very worried about losing weight as even the thought of food makes me gag. Help/advice of any kind is appreciated, and anyone that has managed to get through the CHS symptoms please let me know your story. Thanks guys.",10

Been toking regularly since I was 18 I just turned 30. In that time I've taken 1 month off to get clean for a job when i was 21 and a week here or a week there to try and quit but it never sticks and I'm right back to where I started. I've also had other addiction problems with alcohol and cocaine. I'm happy to say that I've been able to get over the cocaine by just cutting out the chance of being around it by changing my lifestyle losing numbers and certain ""friends"". Alcohol has been alittle harder but I really have a hold on it now and only occasionally will I have a beer or 2 on a nice day but I've come to not really enjoy the feeling of being drunk. Not so much with weed. 

I've gotten to the point where it's ruining my life and I need to be done with it for good. I'm in such a hole right now cause I let it dictate my life for so long. I recently lost my job due to my boss getting very sick from covid and now I'm looking for work but am to scared to apply for anything as I know I cant pass a test to get hired and its so hard to know what place will give a test and who won't so I just look at jobs and never apply. 

As I've said I've tried to quit before but it never sticks. In the past when I stop I get all the withdrawal symptoms sleeplessness, night sweat, irrational anger and anxiety. I also get a craving to smoke anything so other times I've tried switching to cigarettes for a bit to scratch that itch but it never works out. I refuse to do that this time. 

I'm trying something alil differnt this time. I haven't smoked in 5 days but I've bought some edibles and I've been slowly tapering my dosage day by day. Its helped a bit and I have still wanted a smoke here and there but not like before. Today is my last dose and I'm so anxious about it. I want to go into tomorrow as the first day of something new and good for myself but I scared I dont have the strength. 

My issue now is that its so easy to get and I know one puff will make me feel better.....for an hour then I'll feel like a piece of shit for letting myself down and set myself back on getting clean. To get over my other 2 addiction issues I had to make a tough decision and leave a great paying job because I was required to be in bars everyday for work and needed to get away from the temptations. It worked that time because I made that hard choice and couldnt look back. Now I need to do that again but I live in Illinois where it just went legal and I literally live 2 blocks from a dispensary and its so tempting and easy to just pop in and grab something. 

Ive got the weight of the world on shoulders and am just kinda stuck at home till I find a new job which is not a ideal to be honest because I just want to smoke and forget about it all for an hour. But I won't and I will be stong. I hope.

This was a rambled mess of a post but if anyone has anything to say that could help I'm all ears. I know the roadblocks are in my head and just think I need alittle support to get past them. Thanks in advance. Be well. 

Tomorrow I start a new me.",2

Being in lockdown and stuck at home all day has really escalated the habit for me. I found this subreddit a few weeks ago and I think it finally helped me admit to myself that I need to quit pot. Seeing so many people admit that weed is an addiction for them made me finally able to say that to myself. So, yesterday, after smoking a 9am bowl, I thought “fuck it, no time like the present” and decided I’m starting this quit now. 

Didn’t smoke anything else yesterday, and man was it hard to fall asleep last night. But this was the first morning in probably two months that I didn’t wake up groggy and still high. Didn’t tell any of my family about my decision yet, except my little brother and I can tell he is so happy about it. And I marked about twenty things off my to-do list yesterday! I was keeping busy to distract myself from the urge to smoke, and realized that was the most productive I’ve been in months! 

So, here’s to my first FULL day off pot. Wish me luck and any advice is greatly appreciated. I made a list yesterday of more tasks I’ve been putting off for months and called the list: “things to do this week instead of smoking weed” so hopefully that helps with at least the first several days. And thank you to everyone who has posted here before, your story gave me the courage and the kick in the pants I needed!",141

This means I’m unable to pay for my love of Mary Jane, but also leaves me frustrated with the urge to smoke most days. I managed to stay off it for a month and then had a lil relapse and keep buying the occasional gram(which I regret very much). I was just wondering if anyone had a few tricks or tips for kicking the habit?

My mood and sense of reality is more stable than when I was getting high regularly, and I feel more able to cope with change and uncertainty when I know I can at least count on my mental state being consistent and reliable.

Unfortunately, despite remaining sober from weed, I'm still stuck behaving like an addict.
In particular, I've been spending almost 80% of my time awake staring at a computer screen, mindlessly scrolling through reddit, binge-watching youtube, etc.
I'm concerned that rather than escaping the traps of complacency and addiction, quitting cannabis has simply changed my method of escape from reality, and that I am ultimately no more free to engage in long-term planning, constructive and varied activities, etc than I was when substances were the ""cause"" of my addiction.

Like cannabis, the internet is not widely seen as ""addictive"" in the way that cocaine or heroin are, but because of this they are hugely underestimated as a cause for the very same destructive patterns of behaviour.
I am still avoiding long-term goals, creative pursuits, social interaction in favour of short-term gratification, just now in the form of a mind-numbing loop of passive consumption of digital media. 
Whenever I don't know what to do with my time, I simply default to semi-unconsciously opening up one of the same handful of websites (reddit, youtube, news, etc) and remain trapped there for hours.

I know this post is tangential to the topic of cannabis, but I wanted to start a discussion about addiction at a broader level. My own experience seems to confirm that addiction is deeper rooted than any particular substance or activity, so I'm feeling hopeless that I can see the changes I want to see in my life just by cutting certain things out... 

Has anyone here been addicted to the internet? If so, is it possible to quit? Is moderation at all possible when so much of our work and social lives depends on it?",9

1) Starting to decline offers to hang out when I know it’s just gonna be a bunch of people getting high
2) Not make the reason I am declining known. This is because I know if I say I’m quitting, they will try to gaslight me into coming back with the usual “oh yea weed helps ME a lot, that could never be me” type bullshit

I mainly used because of stress, but over that time my body got super used to being in the state of a high to where now my bowel movement is completely screwed since marijuana basically blocks out the underlying feeling of certain pain and such things. My Melatonin is Fucked because of the weed just knocking me out after a dab or 2 blinkers, or after 5 bowls. My body at day 1 made me think I was going to die Since I broke Out In Cold Sweats At Night And Also That in Itself Gave me A Panic Attack to which my heart was racing which could have caused a induced heart attack. That night gave me a realization that I was addicted emotionally and physically to weed. People say its not a addictive drug and I use to advocate and call people stupid AF for believing marijuana is addicting, but now I am living proof that weed is completely addictive if you are not in a right state of mind or have physical pain which is will reduce and can completely become a addictive drug at that point. All of this is my experience lol currently on day 5, and I Am feeling better and smarter than when I was on weed and I also do not have that sluggish feeling and honestly I feel free, sad to say after being a hardcore advocate in the cannabis community for three years. Please try not to smoke weed everyday like I did because that shit will fire back with withdrawals that would relate to a alcoholics addiction which is scary considering I have no addictive traits and I basically practice for basketball everyday for 6 hours a day so I can say I am in fairly good shape.

&#x200B;

Day 1: Thinking about depressing things, Appetite Loss, Having weird dreams, Relapsed Thoughts About Quitting, Anxiety attacks thinking I might have a heart attack since my hearts sometimes accelerates and palpitates, Cold Sweats

Day 2: Constipations Kicks In SMH lol, Appetite Loss, Relapsed thoughts, dizziness, Weird feeling like I Am Constantly High, Weird Urge To Hydrate 24/7

Day 3: Constipations Still haha, Light Dizziness Rarely, Appetite loss, Thoughts Are Clear Now Like I Am Thinking Without A Cloud

Day 4: Still Constipated, Appetite Is Back, Sudden Urge To Workout, Urge To Better Myself, Positive outlook on life, Will not let weed Control me ever again

Day 5: Constipated..., Just Positive Now, No Urge To Smoke Anymore, Have Full control over my urges

Do not worry It gets better after day 2 or even sooner, Do Not Panic If You can not get my results it takes time and determination I promise.  If you get the urge to smoke Hit a 5x5 pushup session and drink some cold water the urge to smoke after that just disappears and I Swear On That From My results Of recovering after smoking 24/7 everyday for 3 years in almost a week.",7

I made it through the day okay, but around 5 pm I started feeling dissociative, and i've also noticed when I interact with my family or call friends I start to like completely lose focus, like my brain is fried or something. And every night these past few nights i couldn't sleep for jack shit and i kept thinking about how much i hate this shit and i wish i never smoked weed in the first place; but my mind convinces me that the only way ill sleep is if i smoke, and I try to delay it as long as i can and think about other things but it always goes back and i end up smoking every night. and so I'm writing this at 3am bc i smoked and i just don't know what to do at this point, it's like smoking has become such a routine and an escape from emotions and it's like I grew up with it, and i don't want it to be anymore, i essentially want to quit completely and forget about it and fix everything i damaged from smoking",1

I’ve had one or two puffs of a joint since quitting in January, and I hate the feeling! I still love the taste but being stoned feels so effing weird! Like I just hate the feeling and I think “omg when is this going to end”. Reality is weird. I’m in a relationship and when I even have a puff, I find it weird. I’m like what in the hell am I doing (being in a relationship) lol!! Like things that feel normal to me when off pot just seem weird as when I’m on it. I feel like this is why I’m so antisocial when I’m on pot, I just don’t care about normal things. 

The only thing I miss is deffo the taste of it. Is anyone the same in regards to absolutely hating the feeling now?",2

This is my first time here so not sure what to expect, but I feel like I need help and I have nobody to turn to so here goes...

Been a daily smoker for the past 20+ years. Started smoking at age 16, just turned 38 last week. I find this to be pretty sad. Suffice to say I have had enough of this fuck/ng plant.

My oldest daughter turns 7 this week, and I just can’t see myself using anymore. If I can’t do it for myself, I have to do it for her.

Today is my day 1, I have failed many times in the past (I was 3 weeks sober when the Covid lockdown started...), and am really fearful of the first couple of days/weeks. Last time I got really depressed and angry, I hope I can mitigate that somehow this time.

I started to drop weight and feel leaner and healthier, eating healthy.. not a single crave for all the sweet sh¡t that I used to buy for munchies. More productive, even though I still loose focus easily. Overall, I feel really happy with my decision, I really feel this is the last time I quitting.

One week ago I wrote about how a new friend lighted up a joint and passed it to me and I rejected it. This weekend, I invited friends to my place to drink beers, and I sold them all the weed that I had stashed in my place. They smoked 2 joints in front of me.. but when they were smoking the last one, I was really tipsy and got tempted.. THAT SMELLLLLLLLLLL.. but happily again, didn't went for it. 

My Drive is bigger than my Addiction.

On the downside, still not being able to have a proper sleep, and it's starting to affect me. I tried using melatonin, but still no effects, find myself rolling in bed and I always wake up early so I don't compensate with a terrible schedule.

I've had a on and off relationship with weed, letting it help me through some hard times and abstaining naturally from it when work, football or relationships divert me from it. 
I have not really let it affect my productivity generally in life but I've abused it too much since this lockdown began, with the excuse of this period being too hard to cope with.
I mainly smoke it as joints or bong rips, it's criminally illegal in my country. I began having throat pains and difficulty swallowing for a while but now it has disappeared completely four days hence, I presume I was mostly paranoid.
Today I have desperate cravings and headaches and this subreddit has been of great great help. Seeing different reasons why people quit weed always seem to affirm my own. 
Plentiful thanks to all of you and I sincerely wish you guys keep it together without much effort through this lockdown.

And wow it was one heck of a ride: intense cravings, easily triggered, ridiculous anger problems, and I good 5ish times I almost gave in. 

And wow!! I can't tell you how good it feels to not be so upset I don't have weed. I use to cry when I'd run out and go two days without it. But this whole week I haven't craved it once, it's almost unreal. 

I've seen someone do this and I thought it was a great idea. Here's the good and the bad from my first month. 

The bad:

• Mood swings: I would react to situations in an angry, intense manner. It got so overwhelming to the point I developed self hatred. I couldn't believe the way I was acting, I felt so childish. 

•Horrible cravings: I almost gave up this month at least 5 times, it was to the point I could see myself smoking after my shift. 

•Nightmares: during the begin of my journey I experienced a lot of bad dreams that were intense. 

•Feelings of Hopelessness: I use to get overwhelmed thinking how sober I felt. 

•Anxiety: I felt my anxiety way more than I did when I was high, weed had a way of relaxing me. It's been a while since I had to deal with my anxiety sober. 

Enough of the bad, here's the good.

The Good:

•Feeling: physically whole and in complete control of myself. 

•Hygiene: I've developed better hygiene since I don't have anything to make it feel easy to brush off. 

•Food intake: Having no munchies is good, I remember I use to stuff myself right after getting high. Now I eat when I'm hungry. 

•Sleep: it feels much more fulfilling and I wake up feeling satisfied. 

•Memory: I am beginning to notice improvements in memory. 

•Overall: it feels like I have my life back and my day isn't being taken away from weed. It legit feels so empowering.

Maybe not a bad thing.

PMC reached out to me, a few hours after deleting his number. Somewhat apologetic. He seems to be dealing with some stuff on his own. I'm all but done with him though, and will tell him straight up that any friendship or collaboration needs to be a two sided effort. 

Bit worried about someone else, but they are strong and capable. 

I'm just being an asshole really, and overstepping into shit thats not my place. But I said I would do something, and, asshole or not, I have to do it. That said, i kinda miss a couple weeks ago, when everything is fresh and blah.

Despite feeling okayish, have been physically lacking the energy to do a lot. Just drained, passé. Didnt crave at all today.

I wonder if i should just stop talking to people at all. In theory, I know its important, especially to keep a routine, but I dont look forward to, participate in Discord as much. Everyone is extremely nice and supportive, but... I guess I dont have the energy to return it as much, and 100% dont want to be negative or agressive towards those going through hard times, and struggling to remain sober. Yet lurking and seeing people cheerfully communicate even as they struggle, just makes me feel worse, takes more energy.
But I really do care about their progress / worry about them.

I dunno. This will pass eventually. If I'm lucky I wont sink super low. But I really fear the whole old habit thing. Just abandoning important things partway through and never going back.

On the upside, I know very well that if I smoke, that I simply wouldnt care at all. And that is worse.",2

It was a rocky road, but it feels like it was ages ago. Every time I think of a memory, it is categorized as “when I smoked” or “after I stopped”. My old memories seem like they were from another life. I may be the same person and still have plenty of work to do, but at least now I’m living a different life. 

The old one was horrible to me. Weed gave me comfort. It gave me too much comfort. I was a sinking ship. I had the illusion that everything was fine. It was not. It allowed me to hit a pause button. Comforting in the short term and disastrous in the long run. I feel like I have lost time because of it. 

6 months is not even enough. I have a long ways to go. I feel better now that I am going in the right direction. And when I’m low. I cry. Instead of numbing my emotions like the tough guy I thought I was. I let it out in privacy and get the same relief that I once felt from smoking. Minus the baggage that comes with it. 

I remember nights laying bed and completely numb as I continued to reach for my bowl. Now I reach for nothing. I feel empty still but I am no longer tied down. The grass is not much greener here on the other side. But it’s growing.

2020-05-26 00:45:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gqqgvz/im_not_sure_what_happened_today/,I’m not sure what happened today,"Bit of info: I’m 20 years old, go to uni and have never been suicidal or depressed (maybe a little but i would never call it a true depression). I used to be a daily smoker until 3 months ago when my country went into quarantine and i just quit smoking cold turkey. I had no issues with this except being bored for a bit but that went away after a while. 

After being stuck inside for basically the whole 3 months me and a friend decided to hang out to get like a sense of normal life again. We’ve been smoking together for like the past 3 years so why not have a little weed for some vibes. 

Everything was fine until 10 minutes into smoking and i felt like my neck was in a weird position and i just couldn’t fix it no matter what i tried. Then i looked at a huge windmill and just felt a sense of being so small and insignificant in this world.

This was when it took a very wrong turn. 

It felt like there was a huge cloud of thoughts in my head that was separate from my normal thoughts but these thoughts were way louder than my normal thoughts. I basically couldn’t suppress them, they just kept coming. 

Suddenly all of the conspiracies i ever read about were going through my head and normally i read conspiracies because i think they’re interesting but now i was actually BELIEVING them. I’d like to add that i was believing them but at the same time i knew it wasn’t real but i just couldn’t stop doubting everything that was real because these dark thoughts were just so loud. 

For example: The people around me were robots from the government that were keeping an eye on me. Then i would say to myself: No, these are crazy thoughts, this can’t be real. But then i would start doubting my normal thoughts thinking that that’s what ‘they’ want you to believe. This eventually led me to believe we live in a simulation which proceeded to give me suicidal thoughts and that there are no rules in this world and i can do whatever i want. 

When this crossed my mind I realized this was bad and that this is probably how it feels to go insane. Just being not in control of your own mind. 

It got even worse after this. I started getting thoughts  of things like:

If there are no rules i could just kill people and why would i care? These people aren’t real they’re fake. It’s just a simulation.

I had to force myself to not think by literally saying “DONT THINK” in my head all the time otherwise i feared these thoughts would take over. 

I managed to keep suppressing these thoughts until i sobered up after which i told my friend what happened and why i wasn’t talking much. (I didn’t want to tell him while he was still high out of fear for him getting dragged into a thought spiral like that too). 

After i sobered up and told him about it I felt so good. Like literally the happiest i have been in months. Life was back to normal. So we talked for a couple hours without smoking anymore (we ended up throwing the weed away) and i dropped him off and went home. 

This was when i started feeling weird again and started having the same thoughts except they were much more manageable and i just used the same tactic of saying “don’t think” in my head. 

Except the thoughts just keep coming back. While i was having the bad trip i already had the fear of this shit scarring me for life but i hoped it wouldn’t happen... Is this what my life is gonna be like now? Just constantly suppressing these thoughts whenever they come around?

I’m curious if anyone has had similar experiences and perhaps some advice? 

I know one thing for sure though. I will never smoke weed again. I have never experienced anything like this. It felt like my world was falling apart. No feeling is worth taking that risk for me. 

I hope i’ll feel more normal tomorrow after some sleep..",1

2020-05-26 00:14:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gqq1mc/day_14_and_still_struggling/,Day 14 and still struggling.,"Hi all,

I have smoked daily for the last 13 or 14 years with the exception of 4 times that I have quit, each time quitting for 3-4 months. I struggle to maintain my sobriety because I have extreme social anxiety and some difficulty with emotionally handling others' expectations of me. I am strong in the short term, but I seem to run out of steam at that 3-4 month mark. This is because I struggle to handle my feelings without the potent numbing effects of weed, and I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to form new coping mechanisms. I get plenty of exercise, I would rate my diet a B-, and I am currently in therapy for my emotional issues. Today is my 14th day without, and I am still having a pretty hard time. 

There are MANY positives: my head is clearer and I feel like I am able to process information more efficiently, I have more motivation to be productive, I seem to have more time, I haven’t been eating as much trash, and I’m obviously saving money. Also, after having fits of extreme depression and being unable to eat at all last week, those symptoms have mostly gone away. 

However, many things have not improved. I have cried every day since the day I quit, and I still don’t feel like I have a handle on my emotions or my anxiety. I still can’t sleep without waking up a hundred times and feeling like I got 6 hours of sleep after being in bed 9 hours. And the cravings. Holy shit the cravings. I just quit juuling/vaping two months ago, and I swear the cravings from weed are worse. They are not as frequent as my nicotine cravings were, but the 2 to 3 times a day I have them they last for like half an hour and I feel like my mind is being ripped apart without my numbing agent. I am still staying strong for now, but I worry that I once again will break before I can pass that 4-month mark. It’s so hard to hang in there when I have failed so many times.

Can anyone relate to this post-two-week-mark agony? I’ve been camping this sub since I quit two weeks ago, and it’s so encouraging to see everyone’s positivity, but in some ways it makes me feel isolated in feeling the way I do after this long without it.",2

First let me start off by saying, if you went to weed to help your problems and heal you remember that you are all you got and weed will never be a permanent solution. 
The reason why i’m completely stopping now is because i’ve gotten really bad vertigo and stomach aches ( possible CHS) from my pen originally and it has been happening w flower too. With this push i’ve decided to stop today, or my well-being and mental health.
Negatives of weed: 
-Money is being wasted 
- It’s only temporary
- I’m masking my problems 
- I’m always exhausted and can’t keep a normal conversation to save my life.

Positives 
- It helped me realize that life will be okay, that pain is temporary.
- Super fun, shows were always a 10/10

Right now, especially today - I'm having trouble getting motivated to do anything productive. I've had some manageable days during this recovery stint.

My dad has struggled with his own addictions and demons, but he's admittedly been absent and unavailable emotionally for my whole life. 

I just feel an overwhelming burden of correcting past mistakes, and building a life that almost seems unattainable due to negligence of my own self.

Pretty much have to get out of bed straight away or ill just toss and turn and toss and turn. and surprisingly my appetite has gone up haha. i feel like this is opposite to most people i feel like smoking regularly lessens my appetite. like ill snack heaps but full meals will be a struggle. where as now im practically inhaling my meals haha.

I've been smoking for 5 years, daily for the last 2. Just like all of you, I had my reasons to smoke, but I really want to focus on what made me want to quit.

-Anxiety: This is probably the engine driving my leave train. When I smoke weed, I feel like I'm a pussy. I will go out of my way to avoid people and confrontations, feels like I can't stand up for myself, which really takes it's toll on my self esteem. I keep lying to myself and coming up with reasons to justify avoiding confrontations, while deep down I know it's the weed. I don't want to call my family and friends, don't want to call doctors, don't want to connect to any other human being, even if it's for my own good. 

-Bad sleep: I never remember my dreams, and I always wake up heavy headed. Although I sleep for a minimum of 8 hours, they only feel like 2 or 3.

-Never in the mood to work: I always come up with excuses to postpone anything I have to do, but worse, anything I actually want to do. I keep pushing exams back. I'm a youtuber as well, which is what I enjoy, but my uploads started to become less and less, as I invest more and more time into smoking. 

-$$$: this goes without saying. 

-Memory: To be honest, even before I started smoking I had a terrible memory, but smoking made it worse. I keep forgetting movie names that I watched a day ago, I watch entire series without retaining more than 2 or 3 characters names. It's like whenever I'm smoking, I'm deleting time out of my life.

Enough with the that, let me tell u about what I'm experiencing so far, even though it's only been a week.

The most annoying, or maybe the only withdrawal I suffer from is my stomach, it's killing me. It's giving me pain 24/7 and I'm constantly burping. I literally had stop writing, went to throw up then came back. I've read that such thing is to be expected, but I'm gona check with a doctor, better safe than sorry.

Other than that I'm not complaining, I feel more energy, I've uploaded more videos in the last week than I do in a month with weed, feeling WAY more self confident and I'm actually going out of my way to make contact with people, just to flex on myself xD.

One last thing I want to add is that weed isn't bad, it's like everything else in the world, you can abuse it, and that's what I did. I would love to not completely quit, but just smoke on occasions. But I'm not sure, if I smoke one join after say 2 or 3 months, granted that I have the will power to keep it occasional, will that undo all the good I did? 

Thank you for reading, stay strong.",2

I've wanted to quit in the past but always relapsed, the past 5 years have been the worse for sure. I never brought weed home for the first 5 years of smoking but when I finally convinced my parents that there wasnt anything wrong with smoking a bit of weed that's when I turned my life upside down. I spend every last penny of my wage on weed, most weeks I would just lie to my dealer and get an extra £60 worth knowing full well I cant afford it.  I'll do a full day at work and sit in my room and just smoke the night away in complete isolation. I'm genuinely scared of the life I have paved for myself, I dont want to end up homeless or some shit but that's the road I'm heading down right now. I'm scared that I will go to my dealers house on friday to clear up the bill and think ""one last smoke"" and then fall right back into the trap. I cant really imagine life without it at this point but at the same time I know I cant keep living with it. 
I dont really know what the point of this post is, maybe posting about it will give me that extra drive to commit.

2020-05-25 17:07:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gqjd9b/giving_up_w_depression/,Giving up W/ Depression,"Hey Everyone,

I’m new here although I did some shadow lurking last year when I quit for a month.

This time I’m back and want to quit for good - I’ve been smoking practically daily for 3 years and it has had such a destructive effect on my life.

During the first year of smoking, I became severely depressed with constant suicidal thoughts. To be honest, I know a lot of this was caused by background things - I’m very unhappy with my life in general and have a lot of issues there, however I definitely think the weed helped to trigger this - giving me the time and headspace to overthink things into oblivion.

Anyway - I had been feeling particularly positive recently and have been trying to take steps to get my life back on track. I very much felt like the cloud was beginning to lift and I was feeling the best I’d felt in months...


I thought now, when I’m feeling stronger, would be a great time to quit as it’s something I’ve always known would be better for me. However, today is my first day sober and, after having quite a positive start to the day, one thing set me off and I spiralled into spending hours in bed thinking some dark shit. It’s been extremely frustrating as I finally felt I was getting myself together and now one day sober and I feel mentally awful. It’s been quite upsetting to go quite a few weeks without having suicidal thoughts, to then spend the whole day focused on them.

I know I’m obviously right at the height of the curve (hello day 1!) and I have every intention of sticking with this - the one positive is that even though I want to retreat and smoke, my brain has finally caught on that it’s not gonna help.

So, I’m wondering if anyone else has been in similar situation of juggling quitting with depression and any tips you might have? One of the biggest things I’m struggling with is telling wether the depression uplift is being caused by withdrawal or whether it’s just my current normal state, that was being hidden / relieved by being high all the time...",4

2020-05-25 16:13:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gqideb/5_weeks/,5 weeks 😁,"Hello peeps,

I want to share my story, 

I've been psychologically and emotionally addicted to weed for 10 years(the only safe place i had). With alot of ups and downs i tried to quit many times.  I was born in a wartorn country 92-95, we all lost alot in those times . Even now, the scars of the past hunt our elders. 

I started to smoke in my teen years to escape the pain ( of course i wasn't aware at that time) my mom died, then my best friend had the same fate and i have a small sister to take care of, well you get the point. I tried so many things through out my life to ""fix"" my mental health so i had to learn everything alone from books, audio books etc basically things you can have while working. I'm still thankful that this plant exists it saved me many times, but i can't control it. And as you know when a relationship reaches the point of  self-sabotage it's a ripe time to ""CUT"" it, one last time i hope 😅. This time i took a different approach i started to write something like a journal you can say, i write just few things every evening like, to drink a detox water first thing in the morning or similar stuff you will know what's best for yourself. 
-2018 was a funny year to me, 😅 i was sober for 5 months
then i wanted to celebrate yep yep and i did 😂 (old desires with new and much stronger intensity) from there on i smoked it with some rules like at certain times and a ""holy"" place. But, there is always that 'but' i lost control of that routine-like behaviour mid course 2019 the desire itself to smoke intensified insanely at that point i had a decent job (cnc stuff and part time coding ) and most of you are familiar with the downward spiral and i played it well Hahaha. So this brings me to 2020, a year with alot of needed change for all of us. And here I'm, 5 weeks sober and calmly walking the rest. 

And i want to thank you ALL, your intentions alone to quit and have clear eyes gives me the power to do the same. 
 Thank you 🙏",6

Ive been struggling with addiction to MJ for   13 years, quit many times, longest i went was a year. now it's been about 2 years non-stop... i reduced my intake this past month with terrible results. Any time i tried quitting, within 12 hours i would feel depression, anxiety, horrible mood swings, loss of appetite...felt like i was going insane...

recently discovered Wim Hof breathing method, i just tried it 3 days ago and felt amazing... no cravings or withdrawal... in fact when i had an edible i felt like shit...

ive been doing it for past 2 days, and this is the first time i have gone cannabis and withdrawal free in 24 hrs... i can't believe it!

i have an ounce at home and dont even feel like touching it... anytime i get slightest craving or any withdrawal i do the breathing and feel great... it's like small hit of weed!

give it a try and please write back if it works for you",2

my girlfriend currently has her sister’s dog, which is around 2 years old. it was a rescue with some interesting behavioural issues. my dog, on the other hand, is very well trained, and is often referred to as the “dream dog”. for the most part, our dogs get along, but hers still has trouble with boundaries, even going as far as to pee on her— TWICE in one day! he’s also peed on my dog, and almost got me in the crossfire. he humps other dogs and steals toys from them for no reason. 

anyways, long story short.. i was in the bathroom, and i hear all this commotion, like the dogs are fighting. my girlfriend yells at them and breaks it up, and everything is quiet. i figure it’s all taken care of. i finish up, exit the bathroom, and what do i see? blood. everywhere. 

i guess her dog got a little bit too excited playing tug-of-war with my dog, and when my dog took the toy, it got a bit aggressive, and mine got aggressive right back, which escalated into a scuffle that resulted in her dog getting a 1 cm slice on his ear.. which bled like crazy. 

so, we wrapped up his ear and brought him to the after-hours vet clinic. since he didn’t technically belong to us, we felt we had to take him in rather than figure out a fix ourselves, as it clearly wasn’t a life-threatening injury. 

a few hours and $300 later, he was bandaged up and given a cone, and we brought him home. 

hooray for day 31.",2

So basically I’ve smoked on a semi-regular basis for the last 1.5-2 years. My use would vary somewhat, I’d go through stages of heavy (essentially daily) smoking and then periods where I’d only smoke a couple of times a month, but I don’t think a month went by in which I didn’t smoke. During lockdown it was starting to become a problem again and I pretty much smoked three times daily for two or threes weeks straight. Even my friends noticed it was becoming a problem, and so I decided to quit for good. 

I haven’t really had any major withdrawals and don’t really have any urges to start again, but one thing I’ve noticed is that my libido is totally gone (it used to be sky high while smoking). I’m still “functioning”, but I just don’t have any drive or desire anymore and it’s a really humbling feeling. During my first week of quitting I started minoxidil for hairloss (nothing too bad but I thought I’d try to prevent any further loss) and initially chalked it up to that, there have been some anecdotes in which minox has affected sexual health but nothing proven, and after reading some stories on here I think it’s more likely to do with quitting.

Anybody else had similar experiences, and how long did it take for you to get back to normal?",1

Just before quarantine started, I started smoking every day. (I smoked every day only a couple of times before this and found it easy to get out of because it was never longer than 2 weeks because of school!).

The moment I realised I wanted to quit was when I tried to just take a day off weed like I usually would but after 2/3 months of smoking heavy (I mean I smoked an Ounce in a week at peak) I could not take it and did not even last one day, I smoked to get to sleep and returned to my normal habit. I did not like that this 'harmless drug' has control over me and thats why I wanted to quit.

The kick in the ass was only a couple days later when my mind told me once again that it did not like this routine and I had another anxiety attack but this time, I went to my Mum and I told her everything, my weed habit, every drug I've taken, my brutal breakup that wrecked me only months later. Everything. Anyone who gets Anxiety I am not going to stress this enough; TELL SOMEONE. (I also told multiple friends)

I relapsed on the 5th day of that second try (you could count it as my first full try) and It was because my mind convinced me that I could try moderation. I could not. It took only four days for me to start smoking daily again.

I definitely think that being isolated with nothing to do (don't start uni till June & if you lost your casual job like me!) meant I looked for weed more and more to entertain me during the day when there was nothing to do. This meant I was smoking more and more to fill up my day. Weed makes things that would bore your sober-self, entertaining. This is not a benefit of weed. It means you can fill your day with useless shit and feel good about it. 14 hours of playing video games, watching youtube and eating and I think I'm doing well? No, I was wasting away my life.

I'm on Day 2 currently and even though I've been anxious, emotional and all the rest I literally have the r/leaves page set on new on my laptop all day and when I feel any sort of craving etc I go straight to it and just read everyone's posts. This has been both easier and harder than the previous attempt, but I didn't have you guys and gals. thankyou!",2

Or I can't do curbside pickup cause I'm worried about parking in the wrong spot or being embarrassed cause I do it wrong or something.  And just lots of anxiety over alot of things.  

Anyways I'm just wondering if other people had experienced increased anxieties as they continued smoking.  Did it get better when you quit?  Could you do things now that you used to be scared to do when you were smoking?

Until some time ago, when I had a fight with my gf, and I found some weed in a vaporizer that I gave a friend.
So i smoked it, and after that it all went down.
Never knew that just one joint can do so much damage...

My dad asked me to get him some, and before I knew it, I was smoking again, first with some tobacco replacement and then with tobacco again.
Felt like it all went down the drain, all the effort and hardship I went through.
Now im trying to quit again.
The craving are more intense now, and insomnia is back, but i'll fight it, being weed free felt different, I wish to be presence, rather then high.
And I believe it will drive me towards stopping.

Talked on the phone with a new friend I’ve made in this journey of recovery. Also had a very good conversation with my mom. Today felt pretty easy but I’m sure there will be days where it won’t be quite as easy. I want to leave behind here a speech from Carl Sagan talking about the Pale Blue Dot, a photograph of earth taken from 6 billion kilometres away close to the outermost planet Neptune. When I first heard it on the new Cosmos I was moved to tears. It really makes you realize how small we are as human beings living out are lives on a relatively small planet in an endless universe. I read it today to kinda get out of my head and it really worked. I hope it can do the same for some other folks out there. Stay strong fellow leavers. 


Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

I no longer think that weed is a good solution for anxiety, at least not in the long term. I confess that I've known for a long time that my habit is crushing me in multiple ways, namely

1) I'm sacrificing my long-term health for short term happiness. I already have chest pain, get out of breath easily, and cough every morning.

2) I'm teaching myself that I don't have any willpower and enslaving myself to a substance. I've formed a dependency by always convincing myself that whatever I'm about to do would be more pleasant if I were high.

3) I'm becoming too idle. I'd like to study and write more, but weed is really good at convincing me to put off work. I find myself falling into a cycle of stagnation, guilt, and anxiety.

I've spent a lot of time rationalizing these problems. I've also tried to quit before. This time, I want to quit for good.

I fighted with my spirit and ended accepting it...
Grabbed and hid in my wardrobe for a while and I think that I did not smoke it because I didnt had an apropriate paper to roll it...

To this time I had a great great attitude that changed everything ans gave me strenght.: I called for help of my friends!!! They gave me so much force and I hope my story helps you that are craving.

When the urge comes just remember how it is your mind and the bad spirits trying to trick you, because you already know that weed will let you depressed 10 minutes after!!!

We dont need it to be happy and im proud of beeing able to throw it away!!!!",12

Today once seemed unfathomable. I did not think I could have a life that wasn’t built around smoking. I used to wake up in the middle of the night to get high so I could stay asleep. I don’t really have words right now. My life is so, so perfect, despite everything. I’ve accomplished so much in sobriety that I simply could not have while using. I’ve been able to choose what is and is not worth my time. I’ve been able to make friends when before, I had none who I wasn’t buying pot from. There are still times where I’m addict-y: relationships are hard for me. I jump into love and burn out quickly. I got into building PC’s, which if you’re into that you know it’s a kind of addiction. Money, I’ve learned, is another substance that fuels its own dependencies. I still have a lot to work on—the road is long. It is a much smoother road, though. I’m just here for upvotes and validation and to answer questions. 

On how I’ve stayed sober:  

I was never one for 12 Step despite going to meetings sometimes. I’ve stayed sober through a commitment to therapy and family. I’m very lucky to have a family who has been endlessly patient and loving toward me. I know that’s not something everyone has. Therapy, though, can be accessible. There are therapists all over the country who specialize in addiction and operate on a sliding scale, who will work with you financially to make sure you prevail. 

To use the language of 12 Step, though: for the addict still struggling and using, even while reading this—


I know this is a hard time for a lot of people and that even genuine connection can feel insincere over the phone. It can be easy, especially now, to turn to substances instead of loved ones for catharsis. Remember, even if you’ve dug yourself a hole, you still have a shovel and can dig yourself out. Reach out to those around you—old friends, family, people you want to trust. 

I’m going to celebrate today because sobriety is worth celebrating everyday. I love you all very much.",38
2020-05-24 13:20:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gpti37/deeply_ashamed_of_myself/,Deeply ashamed of myself.,"I basically started smoking in college, hiding from good friends who would stop me from doing this. But basically I've bought weed and sold some of my valuables to buy weed (even though I didn't have money). Initially it wasn't regular, but as far as I remember, I have at times become dependent on it. Wasted a lot of time in obtaining it, learning to make joints, and basically getting wasted and abusing the substance whenever I'd get a chance. Plus college was expensive, without scholarship I completed it. 

Didn't study anything for the placements, have very low grades, and basically did nothing much during 16-22. I have learnt that nobody can save me, but I'm helpless like a child rn. Still staying at home, being a burden to my parents and eating off their bank balance, with no financial backup for myself. Feelings of fear, shame, anger and hatred are there within me now. I'm frightened as fuck about my future. Most probably I'm gonna die a beggar. 

I see myself as a skewed intelligence. I'm crooked, wicked and unkind, a whiny asshole crying over very simplistic things who only knows to waste father's hard earned money on three substances (weed alcohol and cigarettes). I have severe mental illness issues. I was looking for shortcuts to success in college, basically to become a rapper. Didn't work out, also I didn't have good relationships with teachers in my college as well. I'm about to turn 23 next month, and currently I'm 194 days marijuana free.

I hate myself.",5

It never really occurred to me that I might be addicted until about a year ago. My parents have been daily smokers since they were like 20, and they think it’s a miracle drug. Don’t get me wrong, marijuana definitely has lots of medicinal benefits, and if it helps someone, great! I won’t stop you. I believe it should be decriminalized and it has its uses but it can also be addicting. Sorry about that tangent, back to it! I was 16 and very suicidal. The night that I first smoked, I was attempting suicide and my mom caught me in the act. She stopped me and brought me into her and my fathers room and we all smoked a bowl together. My mom said it would help me come down and I would feel better. And I did. I calmed down and thought to myself “why would I ever try to kill myself?” I went to bed and had the most restful sleep. From that day on, they encouraged me to smoke every day, no longer as a medical thing but as a leisure thing. They started giving me a gram of two every couple of days and they even bought me all my paraphernalia. If I tried to turn it down, they’d peer pressure me saying it’s not addictive and that I’m demonizing a medicine. They would make me feel guilty, we’d all smoke, and then we would be cool again.  As long as I was under that roof, I was high. Fast forward a couple of years, and I can’t even enjoy any activity unless I smoke right before. I couldn’t enjoy food unless I smoked right before. Even then I didn’t realize I was addicted. It wasn’t until I moved out that I started noticing my routines and habits. I tried to justify it by saying it was for medicinal purposes, because in a way it was. It has gotten to a point where I can’t fee normal without it. I can go a couple of days without it, crave it, smoke, and feel not a bit different than before. So I smoke more until I feel that sleepy effect. I’ve been going to therapy about it and it’s helping but I still smoke every day. I just think more in depth about it. I want to be better. I want to enjoy life without being stoned. I want to have a family and start a business. Both of which I don’t want weed being involved in. I have tried what feels like a million times to quit but haven’t succeeded. I have no idea where or how to start. At least in a way that I’m going to succeed. Is there any advice anyone could give me to help me kick this habit for good?",2

1. I never miss my exists anymore lol. To be fair, this is 99% true. I missed one 2 days ago but I realized that was the first in a long time and it used to happen multiple times a week. Also, using my clear head powers, I quickly rerouted myself in a way that minimized the time I lost.
2. I don't have the munchies ever. It's easy to control how I eat now. When I was a smoker I was in denial about how annoying the munchies are. Being full/being able to brush away hunger is so nice.
3. The amount of stupid mistakes I make at work has dropped dramatically. This is another thing I was in denial about when I was smoking. As hard as I tried, I would I always make at least one stupid mistake at work everyday and that is not a good look. As a server, those mistakes often have a direct impact on my income.
4. I don't have any chores hanging over my head. I used to let things like ""call my insurance company for such and such"" hang over me for MONTHS.
5. This one is specific -- Jedi Fallen Order is 10x easier. When I play single player games, I play on the hardest difficulty level. Fallen Order is similar to Dark Souls under said circumstances. I played most the game on my old roommate's PC and had to quit because it crashed (it was a pirated copy). Now I am playing through it on my xbox and sections that would take me 20 tries now only take maybe 5 tries or less. There is one part in particular where (spoiler alert) you get captured by a bounty hunter and have to go through a series of gladiator-style trials to escape. That shit took me DAYS of tries to get through high. I did it in 5 short tries this time. Yeet!
6. I never cough anymore and don't have issues breathing through my nose. I used to cough a few times throughout the day even if it had been hours since I smoked. This was another thing I brushed off/was in denial about.
7. If I'm being honest. I was spending a ton of money on weed. It's easy to do in a legal state. I'm sure I have saved at least a thousand dollars.
8. I have done constructive things with my money/shopping time instead -- such as getting nice clothes, going to the optometrist and getting contacts, got house plants, etc. Adult shit lol
9. I'm back at the top of my game with guitar playing. I have been learning a song by Ichika Mo (guitarist of Polyphia). I'm closing in on it and that is a level of playing I would have not even attempted high. I am a music teacher and going to school for music so this is something I take very seriously.
10.  I am noticing myself working through my emotions in a way I didn't think was possible. My last girlfriend turned out to be a serial cheater/liar and I found that out two years ago. I hooked up with someone as a rebound and immediately got herpes from said person. I was not sober for the subsequent two years but now I have finally forced myself to feel those emotions. I can't quite put my finger on it but I am beginning to see a future where I feel fulfilled without sex or romance. I know I'm not doomed to a life of being single but it's important for me to let go of my dependence on it and experience some healing.

&#x200B;

Life isn't peachy keen but it's a hell of a lot easier. It's like Fallen Order - it's still hard but things that would take me 20 ""tries"" now take 1 to 5. I have had cravings for sure but today I am deeply grateful I didn't give in. Thank god for r/leaves",22
2020-05-24 11:53:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gps02b/9_month_paws_update_anhedonia_disappearing/,9 Month Paws Update - Anhedonia disappearing! Getting better every month.,"Hey y'all.

I'm 3 days shy of 9 months. It's Sunday and I'm in a relatively good mood. So I'd thought I'd write this a bit early.

I write this for documentation, therapy, and to help others looking for an understanding of PAWS (Post Acute Withdrawl Syndrome)

First: **Celebrations! Healing is rea**l, never give up hope. Brains heal, it just takes a long time. Also PAWS hell is not destined for everyone, so don't worry about it too much. I don't want to scare anyone, but I also think shining a light on problems is the way to find solutions. And had i known this was a possibility at all, I never would have touched weed at all. Knowledge is power.  I hope this condition becomes more spoken about.  I sometimes wonder if what I've gone through isn't a mild traumatic brain injury of some kind. I imagine all drug abuse is a ""brain injury"". The words don't really matter.. What matters is something was damaged, and that good habits promote healing.

The brief recap: I vaped Cannabis for 3 months. Had a large dose on my birthday - Sour Diesel. Quit cold turkey and went into extreme PAWS withdrawl symptoms not unlike a stimulant withdrawl. My symptoms were at one point extreme and are now so much better.  37 year old male. Solid career and life. No prior substance abuse problems. Fit. Competent person. For me Cannabis was simply an experiment gone wrong.

My list includes:

Dissociation for 4 months,

Nausea 1-2. months, d

Dizzyness 1-2 months

Vivid Dreams - Sporadic. Hard to know how connected it is. 

Anhedonia - 9 months ongoing

Parasthesia (Nerve tingles / sensations) - A variety of types over 9 months. Gradually keep diminishing. 

Light sensitivity - 1-2 months (mostly just computer screens and florescent lights)

Thick head /head pressure 9 months ongoing

Brain zaps - Large ones sporadically over 1 month. Little ones since

Double vision (just once- 10 seconds),

Visual static (rare occasions)

Anxiety - 9 months ongoing (Though now it's mostly psychological / trauma from the whole experiecnce)

Fatigue - Gradually Diminished over 6 months

Brain Fog - 7 Months

Phantom Smells of Canabis - 2 months

Concentration issues - Severely over about 2 months, lightly ongoing, but I think now is influenced from health anxiety.

Of all the above symptoms, I'm mostly just left with light head pressure, light anhedonia, and some sporadic other symptoms that are quite minor.

Please read my history for more, I have detailed posts to help you see my timeline of PAWS.

My 7 Month Update Post for reference is below.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fply19/7\_month\_update\_paws\_gradually\_getting\_better\_long/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fply19/7_month_update_paws_gradually_getting_better_long/)

I'm happy to say that I'm getting so much better and PAWS keeps on decreasing. I finally had the breakthrough I've been waiting for. This month my Anhedonia lifted significantly. It happened quite significantly and quite viscerally.

**Anhedonia**

I've complained about Anhedonia for sometime. I want to describe it for those who don't understand. Anhedonia is not simply apathy, or depression.  I've been depressed in my life before: Psychologically depressed. I was cured of my old depression through good exercise, good social habits, a change in lifestyle. And really the effects of recovery were noticeable on the daily. My old depression was simply poor life habits.  Anhedonia is altogether different, though it definitely connects with depression.

Anhedonia is like the valve of good feelings is completely turned off. No matter how much I smile, have sex, eat chocolate cake, cry, watch emotional movies, shit, piss, exercise, being gifted a million dollar bills, NOTHING happens. There is no pleasurable euphoria, or dopamine. I've literally spent hours over the months, looking in the mirror, and smiling....smiling HARD desperate to feel a squeak of emotion. I would cry cause nothing was happening. And still nothing. I might as well have been a robot, or a computer. It felt like my head was a block of concrete.  I was plugged up, or the electricity was off, and nothing could change that lack of feeling.

Science speculates that the Nucleus Accumbens in the brain isn't releasing dopamine properly after drug abuse. Combine this with downregulated dopamine receptors and you've got a good recipe for anhedonia. GABA - GLUTAMATE imbalance certainly effects things as well. When I used and abused Sour Diesel, it always gave me a head high euphoria. Makes sense why Anhedonia has been perhaps my worst symptom.

Strangely, I could be in a ""good mood"" while having Anhedonia. Mood and emotional euphoria can be completely separate. You see I could feel energy in my body, I can feel good endorphins in my gut,  I can feel enough vitality to get through my day, but the happy feelings that one can feel in their head were completely gone. I used to get a runners high, but they disappeared with anhedonia.  Often it would feel like I felt some sort of chemical ""flow"" through my head with anhedonia. Like the dopamine was there, but that it couldn't connect with the receptor. A good analogy might be having sex with a condom on. You know what's going on, but the pleasure is significantly reduced and numbed. Yet you can still do the activity. It's like my dopamine receptors had a condom on.

I really wanted to clarify this, because people think Anhedonia means just being depressed. I was depressed and anxious BECAUSE of Anhedonia. Not the other way around. And I could break out of the depression, but the Anhedonia would remain. So I flipped between feeling optimistic about recovery from Anhedonia, and then anxious about nothing happening, and then depressed about the lack of progress and hopelessness. And then I'd kick my butt to get going again, and the cycle would repeat.

Ok, so now how did it change this month? Well I've had small hedonic feelings for awhile. Just nothing to write home about. But last month over the course of about 48 hours I would get this sort of static sparkly tingly fountain feelings behind my eyes. It was euphoria, but it was sort of like static. Like my brain was trying to figure out how to process it again. Then near the end of the 48 hours, I went to take a piss. And the euphoria came literally as I was taking a leak. It was a mixture of the static feelings but also sort of normal. It was visceral and real, and something I haven't felt since near the beginning of all this. It was like that fountain of static feeling only much more real and normal.

Over the next days the feelings stuck around. Now when I take a deep breath and exhale, I feel the euphoria in my head. There's more there when I smile too. I'd say over the last 2 months I've been Majorly-Moderately anhedonic, but now I'm Moderate-Lightly anhedonic. I still have good and bad days with it. It doesn't feel like everything is correct yet. But any gain is a gain. I imagine it's gonna take considerable more time.

But WOW, to feel something resembling normal again. When this whole PAWS experience began I literally felt like a sick Robot. No feelings...welcome to life as hell on earth. With nothing to enjoy, whats the point?  It was like I was walking around with a glass dome over my head. This is why I felt suicidal in month 3. Thank god I got a few drips of feeling / dopamine in month 4 to give me some faith to keep going.

Now with this Anhedonia, it's hard to give an estimate, but maybe I feel like I'm 70-80%?  Hard to remember what normal is now. I did cannabis for 3 months and then have been in withdrawl for 9. So that makes 12 months since I was ""normal"".  I'm certainly more good than bad now though. So thats encouraging.

**Other Notes this month:**

The road to the above was interesting for sure. I had a lot little burning sensations and feelings in my head over the month. Like something inflamed or on fire, but usually just would last a second or two. I also had some disconcerting moments. I had a brief moment of visual static, and then it left. Head pressure continues to fluctuate, some days it' worse than others. It also seems to diminish though over time. I also got dissociated again for a couple of days. Though this time it was much less, and I seemed to be able to break out of it. My health anxiety may have caused it. Probably also caused some of my concentration issues. I used to get anxiety from my withdrawl, now I think I get it because I've been so traumatized by all this. I'll be working to distract myself in order to keep that in check more.

**Hooray! Healing!**

So! Let's end on a good note. Look at how much has gotten better! So many of those awful symptoms I listed at the top are gone. Praise the healing powers of the body and mind. Remember to keep eating healthy, exercise, meditate, drink water, and sleep well. Have a good support network. Journal, and do things you enjoy. Have faith in something. Be it religion, science, whatever. It all adds up. I thought I was going to die when all this began. Everything in life is relative too and perspective helps. As bad as this has been, withdrawl from some other drugs can be even worse than this, and amazingly they heal as well! So really I got off easy in some sense. I remind myself that I keep getting better, and despite my health anxiety, I will get through this, even if it takes 2 years, or even 5. I will be sober and healthy.  I will treat my brain like a good friend.

I wish you all a good day! Ask me whatever you like!",18

I've also been an everyday smoker for about two years.","I thought because I was doing so well, I was doing myself a favor smoking to ease my anxiety and depression.  I wasn't like everyone else, I was succeeding.  I'm the exception.

It's been a week since I stopped smoking daily, and I already see my life improving.  I don't have to force myself to work out, I look forward to it.  I have less trouble getting up in the morning.  I'm more social and even during quarantine, I'm even getting closer to acquaintances that are states away.  I'm eating less, and I've stopped craving dessert every night.  I even crave fruit instead!

I'm no longer numb to my emotions and I'm not scared to be alone with my thoughts.  Because I can't just smoke away the negativity, I'm learning healthy coping mechanisms!  I can't believe how much I've stunted my personal development despite doing well academically/professionally.

I don't add my background to show off, but rather to show even those who are successful can still improve by quitting.  If I don't have weed or tell myself I'm not allowed to smoke at all, I just crave it more.  Instead, I tell myself I'm allowed to smoke if its the weekend or if I REALLY want to.  When I really crave it on weekdays, I just remind myself what a slippery slope it is and what I'll be losing and I stop craving it.

The only downside I've seen is that my anxiety has heightened, but I think this is due to withdrawal.  I've quit for a month at a time in the past and that was my main symptom.  If anyone has advice to get over this hump, I'd love to hear it!

ETA:  my biggest guilty pleasure was keeping up with celebrity drama, and getting sucked into AITA and relationship subreddits.  Since I stopped smoking I realized the drama doesn't matter and I don't want to fill my days with negativity anymore.",5

I have bad anxiety and so I thought it would help me out, and it did/does. But over the years (I'm 24 now) I have definitely become mentally dependent on it. I can't remember the last time I went even 24 hours without at least 1 little smoke. Until now. I know this is such a small win for someone but this is massive for me. I don't want to completely stop smoking but I'm always constantly smoking, every single day without fail. At least 3 or 4 joints a day.

I admit I only stopped smoking because I ran out, but I think it's the best thing that could have happened.

Do any of you have tips and tricks on coping with the physical symptoms of withdrawl like said anxiety? I know its likely only going to get worse when I actually start to withdraw, and its already roughing me up a lot (a side note: ive never really experienced the physical effects of anxiety like chest tightness, racing heart, etc. until VERY recently).

It’s the best job i’ve ever had, so this is huge for me and my family,, i feel blessed to get a second chance. 

This is my gamechanger, a chance for a Hole new and better life, came a long with quitting once and for all!

Never going back to that shit, it has impacted my life in ways, that i never dreamt of while goofin arround the first couple years of using it!

Stop it, before you go Down the road, with anxiety, depression, lack of sleep, lying for anybody arround you, just to get that next hit, the one you foul the most, is you self!

It’s never and option again, never guys.

I wish you all the best, and keep up the spirit, the better life is waiting for all of you strong leavers!

100 days is a very small investment, in rest of you life.


Best of luck with your journey

Love from Denmark",306

So I’m 23 and I’ve been smoking daily since I was about 16/17; there was a couple of periods of a few months where I didn’t smoke because I was travelling and I didn’t even bother me. I find that for me, the problem is giving up weed whilst living in my home town - whenever I’m not here I fancy a smoke but I don’t crave it at all and it’s barely on my mind. When I live here, I stay with my parents and sister who all smoke heavily, and always have the ability to get it (if I delete numbers, my parents can just get it for me). I’d move out of town if I could, problem is money and the fact I’ve got 2 years left of my degree which I’m also doing in my hometown.

For almost as long as I’ve smoked, I’ve known it’s a problem for me, and multiple times have I tried to stop only to start again within days or hours. Recently, due to mental health getting to a point of not being to able to deal with it, I’ve decided that now is the time to stop, and todays the first day of me trying again.

Problem is, my brain keeps tellling me that I won’t be able to quit for two years until I finish studying and move away. If I get a whiff of my family’s joints the cravings come hard and I always end up buying more. The stupid voice in my head won’t stop saying that it’s fine to smoke for the next two years and just quit then, which I most likely will, but I’d much prefer to kick it sooner.

So yeah, just a little vent and introduction. I was wondering if there’s anyone who’s had a similar experience with any advice for me?

Thanks for reading guys and good luck on your journey!",7

I started smoking nightly at 13 and eventually all day eberyday around 16. i am now 23. Wow. 10 years of my life for what.. well i did the math and i have easily spent over $30,000 on pot in the last decade. The first couple days of quitting went surprisingly fine. I used an otc sleep aid as i primarily used pot to sleep. I cut back dramatically before stopping for good a week ago. My heart beat is heavy and im starting to feel anxious to the point were im about to break down and give up. whenever this happened in the past id smoke and pass out. I have a tiny little bit in a mason jar stashed away - my thought process was if i kept a little bit and still didn't smoke then i could really do it this time. My problem is i would always roll with tobacco included making pot a psychological and physical addiction. I bought a juul(yuck) to help ease the process so it is not the lack of nicotine making me feel this way. Just wanted to see what i should do next. I already feel healthier, i just want to not feel like this(anxious, sad, lonely). I started smoking at such a young age to cope with life, grief, anxiety, depression. All it ever did was mask the problem. Any words of encouragement helps. Or if this helps someone else in the same situation, even better..",6

It just felt like an easy answer to give myself when i wondered why i wasn’t making any progress, and it was even easier to tell myself i’d stop smoking as soon as my stash was out, or as soon as i had that one event i knew i would smoke at. I would then constantly tell myself things would get better once i made that final push and got clean, because weed was the problem in my life right? Well no, weed isn’t the problem. Although as many have described here, my high when i first started smoking is nothing like my high now after 5+ years of almost daily use. My high now is uncomfortable. I do miss the times when i first started smoking where i genuinely felt my anxiety dissolve away and everything was vibrant and i felt on top of the world. But remembering those times is what made me realize i don’t hate weed, because at that time it was something that made my life better. Weed will always be something that helped shape who i am. But that doesn’t mean it has to be part of my life forever. I can’t pretend my high is like it used to be, and i also can’t pretend i can smoke in moderation. It sucks and i do get upset sometimes thinking about weed not being part of my life. But i really can’t pretend with myself anymore, i need to find fulfillment that i haven’t experienced yet and i know i won’t find that if i continue to smoke. 

Long rant, and i hope at least some of that made sense. I am on day 1 again of quitting because i have relapsed a few times since previous set quit dates. But my mind gets stronger every day that i choose to say no and i am just trying to praise myself for any effort i am making instead of hounding myself for feeling like i messed up",6

We’ve been together for 4 years and I hid my addiction for about 2 years.  It affected her most by me always wanting to be alone, so that I could smoke.  I didn’t socialize with her friends and even would try and get out of gatherings with her family.  They all thought I had become an asshole because I would be snobby when around them because all my addiction wanted was to go home. 

She was at first accepting of my struggles, but now that she knows the cause, she’s really not happy with how our relationship has been going.    Her feelings are 100% valid, and I’m to blame, well, my addiction is to blame.  It’s really hard to draw the line between the two when she doesn’t even know who I am anymore.  I can only change the future and become a better person.  But it’s tough to convince her that I feel like I’ve changed 100% since quitting.  

I know the road is long ahead, but I hope she’ll give me another chance.  Either way, I know I had to quit for me.  And I need to hold onto the freedom from the chains that were putting my life on hold.",3

I spent the 4 years since graduation working, facing depression when sober, smoking way to much and starting and dropping out of an apprenticeship I really loved because of said drug abuse and mental instability. She knows all that. I'm nowhere near where I was 4 years ago mentally and I'm really proud of myself despite the setbacks. She on the other hand is just 2 years older (24) and is already writing her doctor's thesis. I know for a fact she doesn't face her childhood traumas, instead she keeps everything burried and concentrates on being a perfect academic, just like our father violently conditioned us to be. If she really wants it - great. But I fear for her future and mental stability.

Today I opened up to her about recently being sober and really wanting to stay sober, my regrets about the time I spend smoking my life away, wanting to start school again and how it hurts me that our father doesn't see my progress and keeps calling me a slow ass stupid failure, like he always has. Which actually made me a slow ass stupid failure for a while, until I managed to see that I don't have to be and started getting better. 

All she said was that he wouldn't insult me like that (which he does, whilst being the nicest parent to her) but that he is right about me having achieved nothing, having completely wasted my time and absolutely having to go to uni immediately.

I had a feeling she would react that way and am totally okay with people calling me a failure. I know my life better than anyone and I know that I am very good at some things and, most importantly, that I can try to achieve whatever I set my mind to. Not everyone has the courage to confront their problems headfirst and do everything to get better, in my case also pressing pause on a stable income to have space and time to get healthy.

Positives so far:

* Better oral and lung health.  Especially nice to have this in the time of respiratory concerns
* Less overall guilty feeling.  Living the secret agent stoner life takes a lot of wasted energy
* My perception of time has slowed down. The time warp has stopped and I want to savor this summer.  I gave up last summer to a relapse.
* Deeper more restful REM sleep.  Not feeling as worn out and tired mid day.  Sometimes the dreams are tiresome and depressing, but ok.
* I got my Getting Things Done list going again.  It helps keep me on track and organized with an ever growing to do list. I have a lot of home improvement stuff happening right now
* I read a little bit of a book
* Feeling less anxiety spikes everyday
* Feeling a more stable mood
* Eating less junk.  The munchies are a real issue for me when high.
* easier to focus on a movie and get something out of it

positive momentum to all the leavers out there",38

I am an artist, and while it does make my abilities with art way better, smoking brings me down in every other aspect of my life: I feel kinda numb, my memory is terrible, and I've gained weight from eating so much all the time.

Unfortunately, I still live with my parents for financial reasons (I am 22, taking time off from college for mental health) . My parents are stoners themselves, keep a constant supply in the house, and tout it as a miracle drug, even going so far as to push it on me when I feel anxious or sad. 

Despite all this, I believe I can stop and hopefully regain some control over my life with a little support and accountability. So, I hereby declare this my day 1. So happy I found this subreddit :)",3

Today is my thirteenth day of not smoking weed after two and a half years of being an everyday smoker and 5 years of being an on and off smoker.

Yesterday two friends with whom I used to smoke stupid amounts of pot came to my house and they had some weed. I was studying and then showered, and in that time all I could think about was how hard it was going to be resisting the urge to ask for a hit.

But then I realized that, if I smoked, I would end up wanting more after that joint was finished, and I obviously don't have any weed of my own, and I would only end up feeling disappointed and torturing myself. So I decided not to smoke. The problem was, I didn't know if I had that strength in me. 

We then spent more that 3 hours talking. In that time, both of them lit up cigarettes, which I also used to smoke, and more importantly, one big joint. Even though the smell was appealing, I reminded myself why I wanted to quit and before I knew I was super involved in the conversation and the joint was finished.

I felt so happy when my friend put it in the ashtray, because it meant I had stuck to my word. Every time I remember that moment I feel so strong and powerful.

At night I had some urges to smoke a cigarette, but I pushed those aside and went to bed. If I was able to resist relapsing with my smoking buddies, I can push through anything!

To sum up, if you believe in yourself, you can beat this addiction. Here is a quote from Christopher Robin which is helping me in my journey, and IMO can be applied to each and every one of us:

""You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think"" 

Strength and hugs to everyone!",28

Right now I am really fearing my future as I dont have long until I'm an adult and I haven't quit smoking yet and I dont know how long it will take until I can begin to feel and be happy and I think this is important because I have absolutely zero passions all I do is watch Netflix, smoke weed and play on my pc all the time and I think my emotional numbness is what has stopped me from finding my passion as I do not know what I enjoy or not because I dont enjoy anything really.

It takes me forever to go to sleep but I do like the dreams i get without weed. They are in themselves a trip, in fact I'm hoping to start writing down some of these dreams because I feel like my brains trying to tell me something lol.
But anyhow i had stopped smoking because my bday (24 now) just passed and it always makes me think about my goals and how far behind I am. Smoking weed stopped working for me too. It stopped helping me sleep, eat and feel comfortable in my body.
My goals are to be financially independent, move out and be fit. weed got me complacent at home even though I had to hide it which is impossible in house of 6 people and I was still smoking on average 3 joints a day and carts if had em (street ones 🤮).
I know quitting weed isnt the easiest for a lot of people, I'm also not working so I don't have that distraction but I do want to say... That quiting weed has become less about quiting weed and just more about everything else.

My goal was to atleast stop smoking until I moved out. But I tell myself everyday that I'm not smoking today. I take it day by day but have a sharp long term goal in mind. Even though my bday past, I didn't consider smoking to be the reward because there is nothing special about time passing us by. But what we choose to do with that time is everything. 

I feel smoking weed is my retirement and ultimate pain management. And that retirement/pain needs to be earned. I am trying  everyday to be a just a lil more productive and playful whether it's cleaning the shit of my car ( no more weed smell/paranoia), cleaning out my room and getting rid of shit I don't need (turning trash into cash), taking care of societal adult BS ... For examplr my car insurance went up during this pandemic and my brother and I got together and changed companies and reduced our cost. Now I know that sounds easy but I was pissed initially because I was being overcharged for a car that I'm leasing that I'm barely using it is ( these car insurance companies take the fun out of cars and life, fuck that gecko). I even spent the past 2 days trying to bring and old skateboard and longboard back to life. Whatever I can do to keep my mind busy and in floww. Good music is still good music! If you need weed to motivate yourself, switchp that trigger to music (loud music, headphone music , car music,.. YESS those are all different vibes).
I just wanna encourage people who are scared to stop smoking for long periods of time that you can do it and you have to explore every other interest and problem that you have in your life thats not related to weed.
Save your time, money and energy and put it to other areas of your life. 
I am not afraid to relapse and nor will I regret it if I do. This plant is exactly what it is,, a plant.
And trust me like you guys, I fucking love this plant. But you should never love something that cant love you back and if your life is out of balance, try putting that same passion and love towards other things. Especially all the things you have been putting off. 

I can't wait for the day that I get to post on this message board that I have moved out and my goals have become a reality.",1

Quarantine has been weird and there have been points where I’ve thought about throwing the abstinence away and smoking again. Probably because it would be easy and I’m bored sitting around all day. But after those humps I’m always glad that I never gave into the temptations. Being clean and having a clear mind feels great. It’s like I have 20/20 vision on what’s important in my life again (relationships w/ family, girlfriend...self growth... job). 

Maybe my abstinence won’t last forever, maybe I slip up in the future and give into temptation. At least I know what it feels like to be clear again. If I ever give in I’ll know that life without weed feels a million times better than a life with. Now I know what the right path looks like even if I stray from it.

I've dealt with the initial withdrawals and have been feeling great since. Yesterday, however, it all tanked in the space of about 10 minutes. I've felt like shit since then.

Luckily, I had the good old group meeting last night. I'm usually pretty active but I felt really low so I just announced my presence at the start and stayed quiet, hoping to pick up some wisdom while the cravings started up again. The regulars started talking about depression and mental health in general, so I decided to share my situation towards the end of the meeting in the hope that others who had stayed quiet might relate to my pain, and/or appreciate a supportive message. Sadly the response from the group's leader didn't feel supportive - in fact it was hugely detrimental to my mental state. I'm sure they didn't mean to, but they basically said the same sort of dismissive lines I've heard before - ""we all have good and bad days"" type stuff. I also felt like I'd been criticised for staying quiet. That was last night, and I haven't really slept since. All the day 1 problems have come straight back. Time moves at a snail's pace, I have no interest in doing anything, and my weed cravings are through the roof. What's worse is that I was relying on my participation in that group to keep myself focused on the task at hand, and now I don't know if I can ever comfortably join that group again.

I'm at a total loss. I don't know how to stop myself from relapsing. I know I'm going to start rationalising ""a couple of bowls a week"", and we all know where that leads.

This next 30 days will be about financial discipline. Aka acting poor. Nothing has actually changed in that regard... its non existent.

Been trying to learn keyboard. The (online) instructor is quite helpful and responsive.... though I have some issues with the material... ""play these 4 chords over and over, in this progression, and sing along to these songs""

Could be me trolling myself, but none, NONE, of the songs listed sound anything like the progression, or chords who when I looked them up, I wasnt surprised to discover that they... arent. That led me to trying anyways, because the instructor said they could be transposed, (which is only partly true) then getting incredibly frustrated, punching the keyboard repeatedly until my hand was bleeding, not feeling ANY better at all, (logically why would I) and really wishing i had a fucking hoot.

I HATE being angry at every little thing. It seems impossible to learn anything, and after hours of practise, i really should have been able to get a single fucking rythm down. instead, I found every single thing except myself to blame. (not true, a lot of blame went to myself) (why would the instructor list songs that i can see and hear arent using what he asked for, why wont this site scroll properly when slowed down, why cant i find any simple songs using this progression and key, why cant i find something that teaches me how to properly read lead sheets, etc, etc, etc)

I really hate that every single small thing sends me into a rage  Everything, everyone, is frustrating to be around. Even chopping wood, if anything distracted me or kept me from it, i got incredibly angry.

In the end, I really really wished i could just smoke, and let my emotions turn off. made a promise to learn a song in 10 days, instead, i cant even learn the simplest of rythms. or spell rythm. 

later tried to do the chorus of hurt. different progression, same chords. failed that too. recordrd the chords into reason, manually sequenced it , failed that too.

I am gardening, and beekeeping, and fishing, raising a family and serving my community and church. But I feel hollow inside,and wonder if the addiction ruined something permanently.

Again, some days are golden and some days are hard. But three full weeks a month I still feel something missing or off in my brain...will this return to ‘normal?’ 

Life gets better, I know. My anxiety is gone, stomach problems gone, insomnia, lack of energy, that’s all healed.

I'm not a completely dirty bastard. I bathe or shower every day. I just wanted to illustrate that there are certain basic elements of self care and productivity that I just never seemed learn while I was developing as a teenager and young adult.

Hi all,

I posted before in the redditors in recovery subredit about my initial thoughts as I started my cold turkey from weed. Long story short, I've been smoking chronically since 17 as a means of dealing with childhood and adolescent trauma. Consequently, at 23, I have little structure in my life. I'm now 6 days sober, and the withdrawal has been tough, but even tougher for me is facing a day with no structure. A grey expanse of time with no motivation and, now, no weed. It may seem simple, but I never developed a structure. For most of my life, weed was my structure; my constancy. 

I have a masters degree, yet I don't even have the inclination to brush my teeth or do basic daily rituals that people don't think even have to think about. So, I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to basically build myself a structure from scratch while in recovery. 

Thanks!",1

I’ve been smoking  regularly for the last decade (daily chronic use for probably the last 7 - 8 years) and when I first started smoking in high school I thought it was the most harmless thing to do and that I’d never become addicted or dependent on it. Little did I know that at the age of 27 I’d prove myself wrong. 

I work in a safety sensitive job (I quit weed and  got clean to pass the piss test when I got hired on, planned on staying off it but went back to it after the death of a good friend) and this week I got into a traffic accident in the work truck. I was not high. I don’t smoke weed before I go to work. I never have. 

This resulted in me going for a piss test which I failed, obviously. Being that weed is legal where I live, in that case they then do a swab test to determine whether or not there’s a detectable level of thc in your oral fluids. I got the call from the clinic today that I failed the swab test. I never thought I would fail such a test if I gave myself 12 hours before the start of my shift from last consumption. But I’ve been smoking extremely high thc product at least twice a day for the last 8 years. Of course there could be enough left in my oral fluid to fail the test. I was dead wrong and now I’m in deep shit and could possibly lose my job. It took an event like this to realize that my use had become problematic. When I got home that day the first thing I did was get high. What kinda logic is that? It just got me into serious trouble and I still wanted to smoke. That’s when I realized it’s not just a bad habit but an addiction. 

I haven’t smoked since yesterday and want to keep it that way. I’ve reached out to a twelve step program with the help and support of friends and family and I’m ready to quash this thing regardless of what happens to my job. Because at this point employment is second rate to staying clean and living a better, sober life. 

I’ve read a lot of stories on here and I keep seeing people writing about the clarity of mind that comes with quitting. I’m really looking forward to that and hope I can achieve it. 

I’m sorry if this post is kinda scrambled and all over the place. The last few days have been a total fucking wreck and I’m just now being able to think straight again.",5

Two months ago I quit smoking weed after 9 years of being stoned 24/7 for health reasons. The problem I am experiencing and would enjoy some input on is this; I am an artist (Filmmaker, Musician, Writer) who has been dependent on getting high to feel creative. Before smoking weed when I was 15 or so, I was a guitar player. When I started smoking weed, I quickly realized how to use guitar as a tool to discover the artist in myself. I didn't want to be a pothead, but it was the way that I had found myself to be creative. Over the years, I developed a dependency on being stoned to be creative and make things. I tried many times to quit, but just felt like I couldn't be my creative self sober and would relapse and start smoking again. Now, as mentioned, I HAD to quit smoking for medical purposes two months ago, and edibles give me terrible anxiety so I do NOT want to take them. Unfortunately this was the time my social media channels started to do really well, and require constant uploads to keep them going. The problem is; I'm experiencing PAWS/Anhedonia and struggle crazy hard to feel inspired/motivated and come up with good ideas to create. I know weed helps to come up with some good ideas. I'm just worried that I won't be able to get back to my creative self without doing it. I wonder if it's just the PAWS phase that I am in that's causing this, or what?

I felt alright at first but then me and my buddy started to talk about times we have gotten too high or times other friends had gotten to high. Which inevitably threw me into that state of mind. I had a wicked panic attack as a result. Like legs shaking and everything. It sucked. 
  I went home and I talked for a while with my dad and after some thought, I gave him all my stash. He made sure that I was sure of it and it wasn’t just because I got too high and I’d regret it. I told him how I’ve wanted to stop for a while but I have a hard time not smoking, so he decided even if I wasn’t serious that he was serious about not giving it back. 
  I sort of did regret it and I did smoke some roaches I had the next couple of days. But then one day I just didn’t smoke at all. I resisted the urges and I still have been. 
  So far it’s been 4 days since I’ve smoked. I don’t really feel too different yet but I don’t expect the changes to be instant. I still have cravings obviously, but the thought of being high gives me anxiety so I guess that sort of helps me stay away, even though the option is there. I’ve sort of been feeling kind of shitty though. Like I’m sick but I’m not running a fever or anything like that. I don’t know if it’s because I stopped smoking and I haven’t really found anything on the internet about feeling like shit being a weed withdrawal symptom. Is this something anyone else here experienced when they stopped? If so, how long did it last for you? 
  I also vape and have drastically lowered the amount of nicotine I am vaping recently, so I suppose it could be nicotine withdrawal as well. I’d like to get off nicotine too but I’m getting off weed first because that’s the only way I’ll ever find myself in the proper mindset to take that step in my life, and it’s definitely the easier one of the two to quit. At least for me because of the extent of my nicotine addiction. 
  This whole quitting weed thing is a bit harder than I expected though and I am pretty glad to have found out about this sub. Almost everyone else in my life smokes weed and isn’t planning to stop anytime soon, so having someplace to hear from people who have experienced this as well will be very helpful. My friends and family are supportive of me quitting but since some of them don’t smoke and the ones who do aren’t quitting, they don’t exactly understand the position I’m in so it’s good to have the opportunity to hear from people who do. Sorry for the long post and thank you to the ones who bothered reading all the way through",2

The other day I started to get a stomach ache in the center of my stomach on day 1. (Still vaping at the time, I assumed I was really dehydrated or something) The next day was associated with the same pain, accompanied by hot and cold flashes and zero appetite at all. I could eat a tiny bit and deal with the stomach cramping when I get I figured it was from vaping but wasn’t sure so I tried to stop. I noticed that on day 2/3 I was able to eat a tiny bit if I hit my dab pen. The stomach pain was relieved for a moment. So I decided to quit both cold turkey on day 3 of being sick. Things weren’t changing and I couldn’t eat so I went to the ER to get a covid test and have my body looked at. Chest X-ray and lung x-ray looked clear. Ultrasound of my stomach looked good as well, I was just a bit dehydrated. Got my fluids but didn’t really feel better. Covid test was negative. So they say potentially a stomach bug and now withdrawals and nothing actually is wrong with my body.

I’m on day 8 of feeling sick but day 5 of withdrawals. It almost seems like a chain reaction made worse but quitting cold turkey. 

I just want to know if how I’m feeling is normal. I do have anxiety. But even with anxiety meds I’m having a hard time eating still. Nothing seems to help besides the doctor prescribed Pepcid. 

Am I almost done and just keep pushing? Or would a bowl be helpful to take this crazy feeling off my body.  I just want to know there’s a reason why I feel this way.

Also.. no more dab pens and vaping but I’m struggling",4

One of the toughest parts of quitting and staying sober is keeping yourself busy when you get bored and have nothing going on. Usually, these were the times when I would smoke so I could escape reality for an hour or two and be content. But what if I told you there is a way to escape reality without the use of drugs? Yes I am being serious, I am now almost two months sober from weed and my life has been great (see my last post for some background) and what has really helped me is playing the guitar. I have been playing the guitar for 12 years and I have always naturally been good at is since the start but I never practiced. I did not practice when I was young because it was boring and I did not practice through high school because I would rather be high. But after those tough two weeks after quitting smoking I've found my self playing the guitar 2-4 hours a day. I practice sharpening my skills, learning new songs and solos, and just jamming over backing tracks. Jamming over backing tracks on youtube is like a form of meditation for me, I put myself into the music and my playing and it takes me to another world. Time really flies when you're playing an instrument and applying yourself. I have even created an Instagram account to something I play everyday. I really recommend y'all try learning an instrument or playing an instrument you know how to play if you are finding it tough to smoke weed or even if you have quit and you need something to keep you busy. Hope this helps some of y'all!",12

Found joy in so many little things. Fast forward last week. I decided to smoke for my birthday. Weed was shit and I didn’t get high. Smoked again two days later and I enjoyed it. Had a great time honestly. Really didn’t regret it at the time and had a great clear comedown. That night my dose of zoloft was increased from 25-50 mg. As the days have passed I’ve really began to feel the side effect of doubling my dose as to be expected. I feel super out of it. So so bland. I literally feel like a robot. I felt like this for a week when I first started the zoloft so I know it’s from doubling the dose. My depression is pretty bad rn. I’ve temporarily lost all that happiness and joy I had when I quit smoking weed. I smoked again two nights ago and when I was going to bed I just felt good. Not high. Not foggy and groggy from the medicine. Just nice and ready for bed. This fog from the medicine is pushing me to smoke. I don’t feel anything except when I smoke. I know my brain is adjusting to the meds and that’s why I feel like this but it feels like a horrible weed hangover times a thousand. I know when I’m used to the meds I will be back on track but my depression is just out of control which is what happens when you increase your dose. The only thing that relieves these side effects is smoking. Not getting stoned but a few hits just makes me feel normal. Has anyone started antidepressants and experienced this? Did you cave and start smoking again? Did you continue the habit or use it to deal with the side effects?,1

Which I'm glad I switched from drinking to weed, both have been a problem for me since I was about 12-13? Not sure if I'm being honest, I started drinking pretty heavily when I was in middle school, and smoking heavily in high school. 

After high school I tried to sober up, knew it was bad for me. My mom is still a very hardcore addict, and I've seen what its done to her. She's been arrested, almost died from Fentanyl, been through rehab, and she's till a mess. Dad more or less the same, but that's even more dark, he's been out of my life since the age of three. 

But after High School ended up taking dxm (cough syrup) one night when I couldn't get weed from my buddy. That started up a whole new drug for me to abuse, my routine after I got out of High School was to switch from one drug to another. For one time frame I would abuse dxm, then drinking, then weed. 

After I turned 21 that's when the real fun started, drank like a alcoholic, smoked like a pot head, and tripped like my brain couldn't break. The last 6 months I moved from Virginia to Oregon and pretty much stopped drinking all together. But after a bit weed wasn't enough for me and I started mixing it with dxm. 

The job that I took on was brutal, I did street petitioning on a political campaign. Company was very abusive, pushed me way to far, sent me out to terrible places. So I only got worse as time went by, but then covid happened, and I had to move back home. Cause I quickly lost my job, and I decided, this is it, this is the time to get sober. 

Got back in april and I've finally been sober for a long ass time in my book, and its been nothing but a brutal experience. Really this years been something else, I'm home but I've been living in my car. My family kind of treats me like a outside cat they don't want. Still proud and glad I'm sober, and I'm not going to start doing drugs again. 

But the last weeks been wrought with fatigue and lack of motivation, sleep around 12 hour on average now. Still wake up feel like garbage, some weeks its better, some weeks are like this. My living situation is horrible and trying to get out of it, but for the time being its my hand at life. I don't know, feel like today should be a good day, didn't even really realize it was 6 weeks today. But I'm still waiting and fighting for my mind and life to get better, but shit its a uphill battle.

Have been doing my best to work on programming, get certifications to get into IT, and aim for the stars with my ambitious. I've picked myself up a lot after I got sober, but it still feels like a battle, was hoping once I got to 30 days everything would get better. But I suspect I'm one of those people where its going to take many months. 

Thankfully I see myself as a sober person now at least, I can be around alcohol and not ask for a beer. Don't know anyone who has access to weed and don't go and get dxm. The fight with the urges I win, but days like this are hard. Not even cause I ask myself what's the point, but I ask when is the misery going to end. 

tldr; Did a bunch of drugs, and sober asf now, but my mind is still healing",7

A couple of things I’ve noticed: 

- simple tasks are sooo much easier now and my mind doesn’t think of them as daunting. For example, doing chores around the house used to be a “big” task when I got high and I would block out the whole evening to do what should have taken 30 minutes. I can knock out tasks so quickly now and it’s doing good things for my mindset. 

- My short term memory has improved significantly. If my parents ask me to do something, I remember to do it now. When I used to get high I always forgot, and they though something was wrong with my memory. They’re even surprised at what’s happening now, but they never knew about my weed use, so I have to chalk it up to me “meditating” now (lol)

- I’m making progress towards my hobbies a lot faster. For example, when I was getting high I would practice guitar randomly with no aim, but recently I’ve gone through a ton of youtube lessons and constructed a thorough practice plan. I can already feel myself improving faster. 

- I play with my doggo more instead of getting tired quickly :)

I can’t believe I spent the last 6 years in a state where doing these small things was so difficult. Life feels so much clearer, simpler and manageable now, and I LOVE it. I don’t ever wanna go back",49

Kinda lost track of how many days, stopped counting but i should be 3 weeks or so, with one slip up one week in where i smoked one j with my father in law under weird circumstances.  


Cravings are there but much less so, yesterday was a drinking day where I would hang with my friends down by the river in the blazing sun. It was the sort of situation where usually it would be so perfect to spark a fatty, but I didnt, nor did I feel the need to. Got some good exercise in, did a bunch of stupid stuff like winning a bet on whether i could climb up a 12 ft wall, won at beerpong for a change since my coordination wasnt all over the place.   


Good old fashioned fun without the thought of wanting to smoke, it was fantastic.  


On the downside im still not closer to preparing for my exams or getting the stuff done i originally quit for. Im working on getting started on that today. I just feel pretty damn balanced now which is new, can let off steam in other ways. The sense of dread and panic will set in soon but I will just not smoke and meet my goal of not smoking until that exam is done.   


I hope I dont go back to smoking stupid amounts like before and im getting a good taste of how nice life can be without weed weighing me down. Once I make my milestone of not smoking for that long I will have to make an important decision of whether i ever wanna touch weed again afterwards. Ive been avoiding the few smoking buddies I have and I know that once i go back to my home country i wil lget picked up from the airport by my buddy with a spliff ready rolled in hand; Im not so sure if Ill be able to say no then, or if i even want to say no when im on holiday in the sun with my old highschool buddies.

2020-05-22 07:36:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gohq76/day_1_again_quitting_and_procrastination/,Day 1 again: quitting and procrastination,"At the beginning of this year I was rocking it, went a couple weeks without smoking and racked up some personal milestones in the process. Then I had a long flight, jet lag (a.k.a. the perfect excuse to smoke ""just one more time"" to get your sleep schedule right), and what has followed has been mostly four months of convincing myself that tomorrow is a better day to start quitting again.

The real kicker here is that I know, really *know*, that I've been ready to quit for about a year and a half now. In the past three years I've had addiction-focused therapy, learned the nature of my addiction inside and out, acquainted myself with all the faulty logical leaps my brain makes in its quest for weed, and built up a whole set of healthy coping mechanisms to bring me into my post-weed life: yoga, running, cooking, writing, meditation... For a while, maybe the first two years of my now five years of use, weed helped me create space to pause and relax, to explore my thoughts, and to give me the feeling of a sort of safety net while I built up these new skills and habits. That time is over.

The longest I've gone sober since picking up the habit was the first 6 weeks of 2018, and man, I felt fucking amazing. What's better, 95% of the time, it wasn't even *difficult*. I had worked so hard on myself, and I was so well-equipped to be done with marijuana, that basically after the first two or three days of shitty sleep it was smooth sailing. Then, after 38 days, I impulsively decided to stop in a coffeeshop on the way home from work, since I was finally 'cured' and enlightened enough to use in moderation. Y'all know how that story ends.

So here I am a year and a half later, and somehow quitting later still always seems better. Either because it'll make more sense for my sleep schedule, or because there's a high-pressure thing at work this week and I can't deal with the extra stress, or because hey I was gonna quit today but look how good I've done all day, I deserve a little reward. At some point recently, I just suddenly realized that this is *exactly* the same voice in my head at work that tells me to put off writing difficult emails or starting complex projects: tomorrow I'll be more rested, I'll be able to think more clearly, I won't have as much to do... somehow later just feels better.

When my country went on lockdown at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, it was suddenly announced that all coffeeshops would be closed down for the foreseeable future, and I felt a mix of panic and relief. I thought finally the decision was being taken out of my hands, and I'd be able to use the lockdown period to start working on my recovery. However, the very next day I saw lines at the shop near my house: what was actually happening was that they were just limiting the number of people who could come in and buy at once. Shops weren't shut down, decision wasn't out of my hands, and since then, I've continued to make the wrong decision. Because, of course, the right decision will be easier next week.

I've got to break this cycle; I'm driving myself mad. I no longer enjoy smoking hardly at all, and I'm spending about 20 euros a day on weed that no longer really gets me high but just keeps me a bit sedated and coughing, a lesser version of myself. I'm hemorrhaging money just to squander away precious hours of my short human life. I wake up groggy and unrested, hating myself for having smoked yet again the night before, and with zero interest in the day ahead.

The last time I sobered up, this group helped. I'm going to aim to post a daily update here for at least the next two weeks as I transition back into sober life. The feeling of accountability helps a lot (so if anyone out there is looking for an accountability partner, I'd love to connect). I'm also gonna try the Leaves chat today and see how that goes.

I know what I'm doing. I've got all the tools to do it. It's just time to fucking do it.

Can anyone relate to this feeling of being perfectly capable of quitting but just putting it off? I'd love some connection and encouragement today, I think it's gonna be a rough one, but I'm ready to let the discomfort be my teacher instead of something I'm afraid of.",4

My story is almost the same as most of you. Cannabis ruined a lot of good things for me and I’ve had a really hard time understanding, accepting then dealing with my addiction.

I have been 60 days clean and feel good! My relationship with my family is getting better im not choosing to be alone with my thoughts anymore, I have normal appetite now and just feel kind of stable as opposed to how I was when I was deep in it.

The fact that Im quarantined by myself has helped a lot, it was easier to deal with the mood swigs and emotional chaos of the first days.

But now I have these ideas that I can buy some and limit myself to one joint every couple of days like everyone does, I am not trying to do like everyone ofc but I feel like it can be nice to relax once in a way before watching a movie or something but im still not sure if this is a good thing. 

Im telling my self that the moment I feel like Im not handling it or not respecting what I told myself I would I will throw everything away and just continue with my daily life without...I’ve made these promises before and it didn’t work but i haven’t done 60 days clean and didn’t have this mindset now: that I can do it, I can control it there’s nothing to be scared of..it’s only shitty the first couple of days then life starts getting back to normal...

What do you guys think??",2

Usually no big deal, but with the pandemic, shopping becomes a bit more stressful as I'm taking lots of precautions and stores have modified things a lot (which is great! Just different and hard to navigate sometimes) and other people stress me out at the best of times lol. Usually I would vape before going to ""ease the anxiety"" which usually actually heightened my social anxiety; and would roll a fatty as my reward/""stress relief"" after cleaning and putting away everything (and then spend the rest of the night coughing, distracted, and procrastinating anything else I had to do, probably zone out scrolling the internet).

 Today I felt like I was a bit sharper navigating the store than usual, and kind of calmer. I got the shopping done, and the cleaning and putting away, and my brain automatically thought about smoking one. Almost instantly I realised I really didn't want to! I bought myself some treats and nausea-calming foods at the store to treat myself and ease the symptoms of this early phase of recovery. Picked up some fancy sleepytime tea, maybe it'll help with sleep tonight. I spent the first half of today sick, shaking and sweating but it felt good to get my shit together, get my errands done and not give in to usual habits. Good luck everyone, whatever day you are one I hope it was a good on! May we all sleep well tonight and not smoke tomorrow :)",8

2020-05-21 23:28:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/goboyx/the_other_side_weed_almost_killed_me_my/,"The Other Side - Weed almost killed me, my realizations after quitting.","I can still clearly remember the first time when I smoked weed at 15 years old (I am 19 now), I was with my best friends and I smoked weed for the first time at the same time that I was drunk for the first time, what an experience let me tell you that. But that was the start of a whole new journey in my life that I is still effecting me today. I know this is a long post but I hope y'all read through it, most of you could relate and it will really help some people.

After that first time smoking weed became something I did with my close friends once every month or so for about a year. I was a year round swimmer and I swam for my high school so I could not smoke weed everyday, and there was no way in hell I was going to get away with smoking in my house with my family there. For that first year every time I smoked I was as high as kite at the further point of our atmosphere, little did I know that those days would not last forever. I went through it all with my friends that first year; learning how to pull a gravity bong (geeb), buying shitty bud, sneaking around at sleepovers to smoke, and one time we even accidentally bought and smoked bud laced with PCP (that's a story for another time). Junior year of high school I started smoking weekly rather than monthly. Now I began to smoke weed in my house whenever I got the opportunity once a week and all me and my friends ever did when we hung out was smoke. Then, senior year came by.

Oh man senior year of high school, I just had to apply for college by November and my 7 year swim career would be over in January. Senior year of high school was a joke. The summer going into senior year I was starting to smoke everyday. We moved into a new house and there was an unfinished room connected to my room where I could smoke whenever and it would never smell, as long as my parents did not come up to the room I would be fine (they never had a reason to come up to that room). This was a stoners dream. As senior year continued I was smoking more and more everyday, after I picked my college and swim was over I was smoking at 8 am before school, right after school with my friends at 1:30 and then at least once more in the day whenever I wanted. Then I went to college, no parents to catch me! I couldn't smoke bud in my dorm so me, my room mate, and all our friends just took dabs all year in our dorm everyday whenever we pleased if we didn't find a place to smoke bud. But then came good ol' Corona virus and we got sent home from school early in March.

Now I'm back home, I'm still using that room to be high all day. I started getting lazy, not giving a fuck after all the freedom I had in college. With my parents working from home and no one leaving the house, I was bound to get caught. Three weeks in, my dad caught me smoking for the first time. He was very disappointed, but we knew this would hurt my mom if she found out so I told him please don't tell her and I will quit. I gave up all my stuff. Let me say this, fuck people who say weed is not addictive because IT IS ADDICTIVE TRY QUITTING FOR GOOD AND YOU'LL KNOW. I stayed up till 5 AM just to dig through my trash and steal back my weed, grinder, and lighter. The next day I was back at it, smoking all day. A week later I started to feel bad about lying to my dad and I figured I need a T break cause I was barely getting high anymore off really good fucking weed. I told my self I was gonna quit for a week on GOD. Well 3 days in I caved and God punished me for breaking my word on his name. This time my mom caught me, and let me just tell y'all it was not pretty.

The first week sucked man. I couldn't sleep at night, I couldn't eat, and my temper was flaring and all this while my parents are dogging me out and keeping a tight watch on me. I had the same BULLSHIT going through my head that I was telling my parents: ""Oh its not addictive"" ""Oh y'all have never tried it how would you know"" ""It's just something I do when I'm bored"" ""My grades are fine why do y'all care"" ""So many famous people have smoked weed and are rich"" ""Oh it's just weed, everyone smokes."" I was just ready to go back to school in August and continue smoking everyday, but everything changed week two of being sober.

This is when my life really started to take a good turn, week two. First thing was that I could sleep without being high, and holy shit I was having the craziest dreams. I hadn't had dreams like these in years. I was able to enjoy food without being high. I still missed weed though I am not going to lie, but as the week went on my mood began to get better too. By the end of week two my parents and me were better, and they told me it's up to me now if I want to continue to smoke weed or change my way of life. They didn't care about my grades or me staying out of trouble, they just wanted me to enjoy life and live life without the use of weed because there is so much more to life that weed takes away from you. That's what I couldn't get, enjoy life without weed. But week 3 ended badly, I just needed to feel something. I drank a shit ton that night and was black out drunk in my own house at 2 am just because I missed weed. The alcohol was not enough for me, I needed more. I spent three hours that night looking for my dad's old Hydros from a surgery just to get high but they weren't where they shoulda been. I don't even like opioids, I've never taken them in my life. Thank god I did not find them, I would have died that night with the amount of hard liquor flowing through my blood. That's why I say weed almost killed me, I just wanted to be high. The next morning, I promised myself never fucking again.

Here came week three. Now I was able to enjoy watching movies and listening to music without being high, I could just enjoy it for what it is. I was reading books, I hadn't done that since I was 10! The fire inside me was back, I've always been very ambitious (even as a stoner) my ambition to be successful and follow my dreams grew even more. I spent my time watching Joe Rogan podcasts learning new things everyday, I was having better workouts than ever before, my relationship with my family became better than ever. I started to see through the bullshit with weed, I started to see through the bullshit in society, I was going through an awakening.

Fast forward to today. My life is awesome, I am able to say no now when my friends are smoking weed around me. I have not been bored since those first two tough weeks of quitting. My ambitions continue to grow, if you told my stoner self or even newly sober self I'd make this post in the future I'd call you crazy. I want to write a book now, I've learned how to invest in the stock market, I've started a new summer job for a marketing company, this is literally just a few things out of all the new things I've done or have improved. What has helped me the most is playing the guitar, I've been playing for 12 years but I'm practicing more than ever now (2-4 hours a day) because it has given me an escape from reality and I'm not using weed for that anymore. I am going to make a separate post about music and quitting weed because it has worked wonders for me.

I want to tell anyone who is trying to quit weed that you can fucking do it. Your life will be so much better, it is not easy, but once you do it oh man it is awesome. You need to get rid of all your weed, bongs, pieces, lighters, just get rid of it all. You're not gonna quit with weed at your reach I'll tell you that right now. Just do it and you start to appreciate the small things in life again and you become your best self. Life is to short to spend hours of your day high and being held back by this drug. Hopefully I've inspired you, now come, join me on the other side.",22

All I would have to do is reach over for the bong, and that would be it. But I got a journal and whenever I have a craving, I open it up and sort of talk myself through the craving with my writing. I usually end up with some sort of insight that helps me realize I don’t need the weed. For example, journaling reminds me that the addiction has a voice of its own, and putting my reasons not to relapse into writing helps me tune out that voice. Today what I realized was that I was only having a craving because I was feeling a little depressed and what I really wanted was to just feel a little better, not necessarily to be high. But there are so many things that do that much better than weed can. So I wrote for a little longer, and then I read some of the book I’m reading and eventually I felt better. 
To anyone reading this struggling with cravings, try not to let them pull you into a relapse. Take a minute to do something else that might give you a little bit of dopamine, and ride out that craving.  Take back your power from weed one day at a time. You all got this!",2

I’m about 3 months into sobriety, from everything. It’s been a challenging time, but this is the furthest I’ve ever gone into quitting. The rest of my attempts were short fails to say the least. 
I’ve been staying with my girlfriend and her family throughout this pandemic and to be honest, it’s been eye opening. We’ve been together, sometimes off and on, for the past year. But seeing how my addiction has affected her and her family is truly heartbreaking.
Understandably, she has trouble trusting me. I often notice her family double checking things with her, especially about me. Don’t get me wrong, I get along with them. But I feel guilty that they look at me in this light. Not to mention, my girlfriend has had to watch my try and fail. I know hurting myself only hurts her.
Not to be corny, but this woman is my best friend. I want to marry her one day. I want her parents to trust me. They tell me they love me, and I believe them. But I want them to know that I’m not a piece of shit. But because they’ve been bystanders for a year, I feel their concern. I’m almost 26. I just want to start healing the damage I’ve done and be happy.

Yesterday I smoked my last joint for the foreseeable future, I started a challenge with my mother where I would not smoke and she would not drink. She has some issues...

Being clean from pot is also a key condition for my parents financing my university education. 

I could rebel against them, sneak around their backs, lie to them, it all leads to one place. 

I am not willing to any longer sabotage my relationship with them over weed. Weed is great, but it is not greater than my family. I am thankful to them for so much in my life. 

Also during the past year daily smoking has become too much of a habit, having started university in Holland. I quickly realized that being stoned all day was not for me, but I would aim to finish my day, finish all my productive activities and then embark on the peaceful journey of the joint. After 6 or 7 pm I was smoking every day, some days even earlier. It began alarming me and at the same time I could not quit even for a few day long tolerance break. 

I'm happy that in this way my parents are forcing my hand with this. I came upon weed being completely naive, even at the start of this year, I saw no issues with daily smoking like I was doing. I realize now it made me waste so many of my evenings and afternoons, I wouldn't have done anything productive during them - that was my excuse. But I realize I didn't want to do anything, even fun activities, meeting friends, doing hobbies. I just wanted to enjoy my doobie and chill.

I don't know for how long exactly I'm quitting. Surely until it is no longer threatening my education. I hope that I'm capable of using this plant healthily for me, I'm not sure yet exactly how, I need time to reflect on it without my judgment being clouded in smoke.

I threw out the last of my weed this morning because I am concerned about the consequences this habit will have on my health.

I smoked regularly through college to dull my anxiety and depression. By graduation, I had my medical card and I’ve been a daily user ever since. Next month I turn 35, and I have finally personally accepted that I have a problem and I’m ready to make significant change.

My wife has always been cool with me smoking weed, but we both realized it was a problem when I tried to stop in 2018 when we started trying to have kids. The problem was I couldn’t stop. We developed a plan for me to cut back but I couldn’t hold to it. We got into regular arguments and I started lying about my usage. When I tried to cut back the withdrawals were brutal. My body would get hot, I’d get short-tempered, and I couldn’t sleep.

Luckily, we welcomed our son into the world in 2019 but I still have my addiction. My wife only thought I smoked a little, bit I was hiding my daily usage. I mostly smoked after she was asleep or on my lunch breaks from work. I just don’t sleep well or feel “normal” unless I smoke daily.

My wife found this subreddit, and this is my first post. I’ve already been motivated by the posts, and figured I’d share my experience. I started therapy and have my first session next week. I was able to not smoke one night this week (with the help of OTC sleeping pills), and I’m going to try not smoking again tonight.

I guess where I’m stuck mentally right now is I know I have a problem but I fucking LOVE weed. I know I have to quit but I’m struggling with committing to saying goodbye.",2

However, today I did something that is not typical for my personality. I went OFF on one of my employees and then the president of my condo board. To be fair, both have been behaving like idiots, but they did not deserve my overreaction. I am typically a very passive person to a fault and starting to consider that might be because I have been high all the time. I do hope being more assertive sticks, but not to the point of being an asshole.

I told her I hadn’t been on this group for a few days because life has gotten busy. She told me, recovery comes first and whatever I put in front of recovery, I am risking losing. So by putting my work in front of actions toward my recovery, I start down a slow slippery slope to my relapse, and then can potentially lose my job. 

I think it makes sense. This group has been the most powerful tool for me to stay connected to my recovery and in the last week that I haven’t been on here, I’ve noticed cravings at least once a day. My triggers have been stronger. It’s no where near how strong it gets when I’m close to a relapse but, it’s definitely stronger than last week when I was checking in everyday.

Today marks the start of my journey into sobriety after months of using every single day to escape my problems.

I struggle with severe depression and OCD, and found that marijuana instantly took away the emotional pain. However, I got to a point where I wanted to be high all of the time and the reality I constructed within my highs started to become my new normal. Sober-me feels panicky and out of sorts. However, I am too addicted, am losing my memory, have sacrificed social connection, and have felt my depression worsening. 

I’ve tried to stop before, and find that I’ll make it a couple of months or so before relapsing. I feel more motivated this time though, because I am traveling this summer and really want to be sober for the trip so it can eye-opening for me.

I am trying to dig into my Christian faith during this time, while also reading, writing, and making music. It is just so hard. Last time I quit, I couldn’t stop crying for days.

This is the second longest run I've gone without imbibing in two years. This go around I tried to quit for like two weeks straight and fumbled over and over again, feeling with each relapse how gross and rough it was to hate the need to shut down at night. The last time I quit it was one clean break and I cannot tell you which way is better, although this time it feels more permanent. Here is some good/bad/ugly I have experienced:

*First few days:* couldn't sleep, started having vivid anxiety dreams, limited appetite, but my eyes looked clearer and my skin started to improve. Drank about a gallon of water a day and started a light workout to ease my mind.

*Second week-ish:* Started feeling the benefits more. Skin looking awesome, had a little brain fog but not like the kind I had every day while high. Laughed more, was a bit better at my job, still occasionally over emotional for literally no reason at all. Vivid dreams still anxious and wild.

*Third week-ish:* really really started feeling the benefit of abstaining. Stopped having drinks to compensate for the void of nighttime wooziness. Skin way better, waking up easier, appetite coming back, and a total champ at work. Dreams less frequent, not as startling. My laughter feels real, nice, loud more frequent.

*Beyond week 3 to now:* To be perfectly honest, emotional turmoil still winds up my urge to smoke. Stress management is rough and my mind still craves the flick of the switch that shuts it off at night. But again, my skin is great and I don't spend my whole weekend eating candy and scrolling through the abyss which how I used to 'relax.' My dreams are vivid as hell and occasionally frightening but also pretty interesting. Last night I budgeted buying and running a comic book store...I don't even really like comic books, it's just an activity my brain did while I was asleep. 

The Discord chat we've been in has been a real asset and this time around I have had the opportunity to use it from my last stumble through to now. This sub also makes me feel sane and I have a renewed energy going into sorting by new and putting a few comments in for the newbies a week. It's important. The urge never quite goes away, but neither does the feeling that I am on the right path and doing something better for myself. Thanks all.",3

Withdrawal symptoms?,"I have been a daily smoker for around 2 years now, being high throughout almost all of my waken hours.  I came to realize that marijuana was no longer as enjoyable as it once was and it was becoming more of a habit than a fun time.  5 days ago I decided to take a t break for a month to reset most of my tolerance.

I have stopped cold turkey in the past, however it wasn't sustainable because of the insomnia and cravings I got shortly after.  However, I am determined to see this t break through its entirety.  

The past 5 nights I've averaged about 5 hours of sleep, which is significantly less than the usual 8 or 9 I would previously get.  I have also noticed my heart rate has been abnormally high (around 89-93 bpm resting, used to be 60-70 resting).  Is this a typical side effect of marijuana cessation?  Sometimes I can feel my heart beating in my chest despite not having done any physical activity.  

I have suspected that this could be the result of my sleep deprivation, but it is still alarming.  Give melatonin a shot?

I turned my smoking time into reading time, and that really helped me get through the tougher times of quitting. 

Overall, I’d say my mental health has improved. I went up to a healthy weight as I was frail and couldn’t eat if I wasn’t high. I feel sharp and like a weight is off of me, and I feel clarity, like I am in control of my life. I have been going to therapy regularly and have been managing and working through my anxiety, PTSD, and depression in healthy ways instead of escaping like I always did with smoking. My grandfather was a longtime smoker as well, and lately he told me that “You are the captain of the starship.. to think anything in your life is in control is resigning your responsibility to yourself”, and I wanted to pass that to you guys.

Don't confuse momentary pleasure with happiness. What we ultimately seek is to be happy in life. What gave me pleasure ( Weed ) made me feel good for a while but did not make me truly happy.

I started writing them on my first try (which is like 6 months ago, had hard time finding it :D ) to remember them more and be able to manipulate them. Its getting better everyday. Also i sometimes dream about being high so im occasionally high tho im not. I hope so my dreams will keep the same or get better by time. Because its really great tho im sweating and waking up. Also im more certain about quitting it now. Because i really started enjoying world sober.

Getting close to 9 months. And I can feel euphoric feelings again (F-you anhedonia). Slowly it's all coming back.

And yet I still get bummed at times. It'll probably take me 2 full years to get over PAWS. All from a 3 month cannabis trial. And having too much on my birthday. I thought it was supposed to be ""safe"" and ""natural"". The world is a harsh teacher sometimes. I remember when I first learned that brain recovery can take years I was so depressed. At least now after almost 9 months it's more manageable to think about. I'm certainly feeling so much better than at any point this year.

Trying to remind myself of all the good things in life today. I'm not dead for starters. Nor has cannabis affected my life in a dramatic manner. It's just been a shitty year, one that will end eventually. And the new year will be so much better than this. At least barring another shitty turn of fate.

I'm glad my brain does indeed heal, and that I'm not stuck in hell for the rest of my life.

Just another day with PAWS. Last night my head was all tingly again. Usually I feel that means something is healing. Hopefully today is a bit more calm.

Hope you are all well. And if you're not, well, at least we're in this together.

Lately I have had the overwhelming feeling that I don't want to live/exist anymore...I disliked myself even when I was smoking but at least the feeling was a bit blunted - but now in sobriety I am consumed by self-loathing to the point where I desire to harm myself or even end my life (I am not going to do either of those things - I have a family that I care for and couldn't bring myself to do that to them - and I haven't harmed myself in months and I don't want to start doing it again). I was just wondering if anyone had a perspective on either of these things - I intuitively know that this feeling of self-hatred and desire to stop living/existing would dissipate (even if temporarily) if I were to just roll one up and smoke it. 

Also, my memories have been haunting me lately. Things that I did while high that weren't a reflection of my true self, or perhaps are a part of me - but the worst parts of me - have bubbled up and induced great anxiety in me. I've had loads of trouble at work since I'm not able to compartmentalize my anxiety/depression and it seeps it even while I am working.",31

Been sober 5 months and have strong cravings. Need advice.


Hey all,

It's been 5 months since I quit weed completely cold turkey. I was a daily user. I quit because I could not self-regulate and I found that it took the joy out of everyday life. I would only smoke when my GF would be at work so that she didn't see me high. She knew I smoked, I told her. 

I found find myself with the weekend ahead of my girlfriend and I, we'd have 2 days off together, and sometimes my mind would be thinking about Monday morning when I could get high again. So long story short, I didn't want this drug to wedge itself between the things in my life that should bring me the most happiness.

Fast forward and I'm 5 months completely sober. But the psychological cravings are still strong. I find myself angry that I cannot let myself smoke again for fear that I am ""too weak"" to control myself and I will fall back into my old ways. I find myself rationalizing that I should be able to indulge in weed on rare occasions without it bringing harm into my life.

Are these feelings normal? Will they ever subside? Should I try and be strict and honest with myself and occasionally use weed again? Should I ban it from my life for good? I can't help but think there's some harmonious balance that I could achieve.

Any advice, experiences, or wisdom would be greatly appreciated.",2

This time my night sweats are still going strong 12 nights in. Routinely having to smell the sheets to see if ive pissed the bed. Nope, just sweat. Every time. 

Im now on day 13 and last night I had to take some over the counter sleeping pills. I've been getting maximum three hours sleep a night. When I do sleep its for a maximum of an hour, then im up for a bit, then back down. Repeat. The pills helped a little, but i still woke twice having to shuffle out of the sweat pool.

My friend said he thinks my body is resisting, because it knows im never going to touch weed again. I think hes right. However, that doesnt make it any more pleasant. Im not sure how much longer i can take it. I feel as if i'm going a bit mad. Sleep deprivation is a form of torture. I'm torturing myself. Ill chalk it down to purposeful suffering for the moment. 

This has just proven to me how much weed was affecting me.  I refuse to let this situation drive me into the arms of weed again. 

Anyone else with similar tales?  Would love to know im not alone in this.

was completely and utterly unable to get my spending under control. Dont think things will work out with PMC. Missed both group chats. Friend keeps asking if i'm okay, but keep falling back asleep before i can really form an answer. 

Depression is starting to sink in maybe from the lack of self control, more likely because im BPD and have been fairly manic the last couple of weeks. 

being around humans is incredibly exhausting. The last time i was around humans for an extended time, I also slept a lot. Pretty sure i have an ear, or sinus, or mouth infection. have doc appointment tomorrow. Over the phone... 

Just so tired. have 0 energy. Despite doing half of my routine, and eating the same.  Dont feel sick. Just tired. Fell asleep a few times writing this. 

Havent been able to accomplish anything in re-learning music. Pretty sure I should be at least able to play hot crossed buns, but i cant even force myself to read a ""for dummies"" book, let alone sit in front of the keyboard.

In general, spend my days alternating between some happy delusion of accomplishments, out of control in spending an action, or in bed depressed, tired, and unable to do much of anything.

The first half a year of this period I didn't smoke regularly and didn't have strong and frequent cravings, but still I was enjoying it so much every time that I never thought of it as something bad.

The second half a year I had more free time and used most of it to explore things like edibles, hash, bongs and so on. Again I enjoyed it so much since almost of the experiences I had were with close friends and people around me. 

With time I began attaching myself to pot and tried to make whatever excuses to put it into my life:

\-I'm more creative and enjoy doing work/chores/studies while high

\-I'm so chill and negative thoughts don't afftect me 

\-I even enjoy working out!

And mostly - I won't get addicted from it like from other things!

But the reality is my home began to get dirtier, my room untidy, I didn't pay attention to my studies, started avoiding communicating with my parents and the girl next to me, started lying I am busy with the university and work while almost no studying was done. I was high for at least half of the day everyday. I even smoked at work sometimes.

So the last half a year I built my life so much around it that I had to stop. All after realizing I have 3 failed classes, many broken relationships all while neglecting myself and lying to everyone including me. I stopped smoking for 35 days. Longest period I haven't smoke since the start. It was hard in the first days but then I started studying, working out, talking with my parents, having better sleep, mood and I realised life could be amazing even without it. 

But a damn week ago I wanted to smoke one, to bloody see what I crave so much and what did I want so much that it ruined my life and still want it. After smoking I continued asking myself why the f did I do this before. And gradually I stopped asking myself. After that I realized what was so special in being high - I didn't think about responsibilities and neglected anything relating to them.

I've been smoking for a week now and I know this has to stop, every time I'm sober I think it would be better if I'm high right now. And I'm sure that's not the damn point of it.

After smoking today I got disgusted of myself and threw everything away. I'm quitting it. Wish me luck guys",2

Or my mother, let's not forget about her. There was a lot of physical, verbal, emotional, mental abuse growing up and I wanted to escape. I needed to escape, if even for a few hours. I relied on herb, all its varying forms and derivatives, and video games. I'm 26 now, and finally, for the first time in my life, working on my mental health. Antidepressants, antianxiety meds, all things my mother hailed as the devil's narcotics as she inhaled bottle after bottle of wine while my father kept himself busy, always busy, so he wouldn't have to deal with his emotions. Too busy to have noticed his younger daughter showing signs of major depression starting at age 5. They're  never going to even try to understand. I don't want pity or sympathy or anyone else's emotional baggage, I have entirely too much of my own, lol. I think this is a good place to start for support.

Was 2 weeks weed free last thursday, but ended up going over to my mates house and smoking a couple of cones with them.

Which was possibly the worst, or best idea ive ever had. 

Like many people I've used weed(among other drugs) to surpress my feelings, while also putting on a flawless facade of being the funny guy who makes everyone else feel at ease, so ive been told. 

I'm not really one to talk about my feelings in general, but the safety of this community and the love that people give is touching. 

Im only saying this so if anyone who reads this, and may feel the same can reach-out and get the help they need, i know i need help. 

I've been an absolute fucking mess on the inside for several years, i attribute it to multiple drugs that ive abused so i couldn't confront those feelings.

But last week when i had that cone, it triggered a massive anxiety attack, which felt like nothing I'd ever felt before, it was frightening to say the least. I excused myself from my mates while this was happening and fully brokedown out the back of their house.

About 30 minutes later my best mate came out and asked me what was up. 

I told him everything, how scared i was of myself, how dark my thoughts have gotten over the years, and how utterly powerless i felt over my own emotions. How i never feel like myself anymore and that the only reason im still alive is because it would absolutely devastate my parents, i just couldn't bring myself to do that too them. 

I told him how on countless times ive just wanted everything to be over, how nothing will ever seem to get better, how pointless life seems and how anything i do in life will eventually just mean nothing.

He sat down with me for 3 hours and talked to me, about everything, just listening to me and letting me vent to him. 

It lifted the biggest weight off my chest that i thought id live with my whole life, i felt so fucking sorry that i was dropping this stuff onto him, for all he knew i was a happy go lucky chap.

But he kept reassuring me how i shouldnt feel sorry, and how i could have come to him way sooner and that i can tell him anything. 

He told me how he also feels on edge all the time, how he also never really feels like himself around our mates and how his last toxic relationship contributed to alot of trust issues. 

Dropping down to this level of raw emotion bonded us more than we were already, i finally felt like i wasnt alone.

Im not sure exactly sure what im trying to say here, nor am i the best writer, but i just want to tell everyone who is reading this, if youre dealing with similar feelings or your own set of troubles, that you're never alone. 

You may feel as though you're putting a huge burden on someone when telling them, and that you can figure it out yourself, i truly thought i could help myself and not have to tell anyone, but it got out of my hands, i came close to doing stupid shit. 

What im trying to say is, talk to someone, dont let these demons grow in you, you're not alone and the road to recovery can be shared with someone close to you, everythings easier by telling someone. 

Currently on day 6 again and i think this is the time where im sticking to it, for my future self and for everyone around me.",8

Recommend reading The power of habit by Duhigg. It might be the tool you need to start your road to a sober life!

Two more things: 1)There is no miracle which is going to make you stop smoking. You need to put in the work. Life is going to suck ass, but at least you now have a fighting chance. It is going to kick you in the balls regardless if you try to fight back or lay on the ground. I believe dying on your feet is preferable.

2)You must quit for yourself. Qutting for any other reason is not quitting the habit, it is delaying it.

I had been smoking daily mostly in the evenings for 8 years but it's probably worth mentioning my zoots weren't that strong in that time. I would say I put 60% if not more baccy and the rest was weed - I'm feeling that probably helped !

Anyway I'm riding a wave and I'm feeling positive that it will last for a bit now, or anyway I'm hoping.

Yoga and camomile tea really helped and I also have been in touch with a lot of people I lost touch with, giving me more confidence that I will be ok in the future.

I've been more depressed this month than I can remember. At this point, I know I'm still detoxing from weed, have had many good moments and short breakthroughs and am proud of myself, but truly not feeling like it's worth it these past few days. I feel like I'm happier as a stoner. I know I need to give it more time and am not giving in, and maybe this is my addiction deceiving me.

Not sure, but I clearly don't feel like I've made it past the hump where the good outweighs the bad yet. Can anyone else relate? Have been feeling lethargic and like shit since the beginning, less motivated to exercise, and generally more sleepy.

Pros: more dreaming. easier time writing for work.

Cons: depressed. low energy. low motivation.

I feel like I'd rather smoke weed everyday than be depressed or on pharmaceutical anti-depressants and am wondering, do I have some underlying depression (why I smoke to cover it up), or are the withdrawl symptoms really brutal emotionally for some of us.

I usually stay busy, active, have success in my work. The downsides of my addiction to weed are dependence, lack of focus at times, and being cut off from others socially.

I've told myself I'll make it to day 30 and re-assess from there, and I'm almost there, and truly it's not been easy but I'm proud of my willpower. It would feel silly to go back, knowing how hard it is to stop. I wish I could have a moderate relationship with this plant.",4

In August during a bad lsd trip I told my junkie friends that I was feeling really sad and probably depressed, I told them that smoking pot was the only thing that gave me satisfaction. 
That asshole dealer told me that I was a fucking broken addict and that I should go to AA (he smoked with me everyday and he SOLD me). Eventually I got tired of his bs and cutted him out of my life. 

Another incident happened and in November I stepped AA with the only guy that hung with us that didn't do drugs, because he was AA. 

I went there for a month, and it was by far the worst of my life. Left my 12 step program group, decided to go for psychiatry and started to take prozac. 
In December 23rd  (149 days ago) I inhaled my last puff of weed.

Since I started to take antidepressants my relationship with my family and old high school friends has dramatically improved. I'm starting to believe that maybe I won't become addicted if I smoked one of these days.

Do you think that substance addiction is a life long mental disorder, or that someone can cure itself and after on have a normal, casual consumption?",8

I'm posting from an alt as I'm not ready to tell people that I'm planning on quitting and I'd rather people not stumble across this post.   

&#x200B;

I've smoked weed every day since I was 14. Everybody except my mother smokes it in my family and every family friend I have known since I was young smokes it too. I've grown up around it, knowing about it from a young age and it's been completely normal in my life.    

I'm 18 now and my life has really gone downhill. I was kicked out and live in temporary accommodation with hard drug users, I am in thousands of pounds of debt and I am just miserable. I spend all my benefit money on weed and I only have myself to blame for my situation.   

I've never considered myself addicted to weed, I always told myself that I'm not addicted as I could stop whenever I wanted, I just didn't want to stop. That \*is\* the addiction.      

I want to stop smoking weed but I have no idea where to start. I have weed as I'm typing this but I don't want to smoke it. I just want to stop.    

I have a great support network, all my friends are really close and we have no trouble telling each other things. The only trouble is they all heavily smoke weed too and show no interest in quitting. We had a friend who quit about 6 months ago and even though I hate to admit it we actually ended up dropping them as when they stopped smoking they started not joining us when we would do stuff because of the constant weed being smoked.    

I can see the same thing happening to myself. I don't know anybody I can talk to about quitting, I don't know a single person close to me who has quit smoking weed. I'm scared I will fail and I would put myself through months of not smoking for nothing. I have so many worries and it just melts into a huge mess of not knowing how to quit successfully and smoking more.   

This is the first time I've told anybody I wanted to quit and I hope that I will be making further posts here showing my progress in doing so. 

Thank you all for reading this.",10

Hi, I was drinking a energy drink called V with about 440mg of caffeine, I drank 2-3 of these a day.

I started having really bad anxiety attacks and panic attacks so I decided it’s time to stop. After 4-5 years of over 1000mg of caffeine a day.

I knew it would be hard and I knew I would have withdrawal symptoms, I’m on day 7 now and I’m still struggling quite a lot. 

My problem is I can’t smoke weed anymore, I have been a “stoner” for about 5 years smoking over 3 grams a day, and as soon as I stopped caffeine I couldn’t smoke pot anymore because it would give me extremely bad panic attacks.

I haven’t had caffeine in 7 days
I haven’t had weed in 3 days
My anxiety is through the roof, I have been diagnosed with GAD and am currently being medicated.

My problems is I miss weed so fucking much and just want a cone. I can’t sleep at night and I just don’t feel like my self anymore.

Sleep is better, my lungs feel healthier but the mood changes a lot during each day. 

I've tried stopping like 20 times, but failed every time.

It would be very helpful for me, and I think the community, if people could comment to give a sense of the side effects they faced when quitting and roughly how long it took before they noticed their symptoms started to become more manageable and/or disappeared altogether. 
  
Everyone is different, so I'm hoping this might get a good variety of responses to provide a more rounded data set. 
  
To start with myself: 
My cravings for weed having mostly subsided after day 3, I consider myself lucky there. The insomnia and night sweats are still kicking my ass, which is my main motivation for making this post in the first place. I have also been experiencing some depression, but I'm not sure how much of that I can attribute to withdrawing from the drug or the lack of sleep.
  
Hopefully people who have been sober longer can provide more details. I still have a long way to go.

The period where I had quit (in 2011) was one of the best times for my mental health. I have always struggled with depression and anxiety, going back to my early childhood and some abuse that left some maladaptive coping behaviors. During that year I was meditating daily, feeling great, and then I got back together with an ex-girlfriend who I had a terrible relationship with, we started smoking, and my mentality got fucked up again and I gave up and fell into daily smoking and gave up the meditation habit. 

Despite the weed habit I was exercising 4x/week pre-quarantine. Sadly I haven't exercised in the couple months I've been quarantined. Still been smoking a lot of weed, though. 

I'm sick of feeling like I need weed to enjoy things. There's a cycle I enter where I think, for example, ""I want to play this video game, but first I need to get a little high"" and then I wind up smoking weed for an hour and browsing Twitter and not playing the game. When I do play the game, or watch the movie, or whatever, my attention is divided and I'm anticipating smoking or actively smoking. 

My tolerance is so high that I usually don't even really feel ""high"" any more. A few times I've smoked so much that I start shivering uncontrollably and my muscles sieze up. Pretty scary. 

Anyways, the last time I smoked was last night -- pretty much exactly 24 hours ago. I've been having headaches, irritability, and stomach upset all day. I keep feeling cravings to smoke but reading the stories here gives me inspiration to keep away. I was feeling a particularly strong craving just a few minutes ago, and decided that a more productive use of my time would be to write this post about the reasons why I'm stopping. 

I need to stop because it's not fun any more. I remember being a teenager and smoking and getting the giggles, just uncontrollable laughter until I almost peed myself -- it hasn't been ""fun"" like that in a while. 

I need to stop because it keeps me from living out my potential. I get too high during the day and I'm afraid to pick up the phone, or answer the door, or go outside. 

I need to stop because it affects my work performance. My short-term memory is trash, I find myself becoming confused too easily, and I've started relying on being high to be able to do my work (I worked from home prior to the pandemic).

I don't know what a healthy relationship with weed would look like. Honestly -- the times where I was laughing were fun, but I'm remembering some of the earliest times I smoked, and I got panic attacks. My ""friends"" made fun of me for it, and I didn't want to ""be a pussy"" so I kept smoking regardless.

Maybe I should have taken that as a warning.",10

LOOONG time lurker, however first time poster.

I decided to make a choice for myself and decided to quit smoking marijuana.

A little background about myself, and why I decided to quit.

I am 25, graduated university and currently working at a call-center(Lucky to be employed amongst this pandemic)

I started off casually, hitting some spliffs here and there. Eventually due to boredom and curiosity my frequency increased. I starting smoking a lot of blunts, occasional bongs, water bottle bongs, vape pens, edibles...you name it. Part of the reason I started was also due to being in University/College.

I graduated from university, ended up with 3 degrees. I have a passion for helping others primarily people who are less fortunate and less affluent. My primary field was working with kids with autism and under-developing kids. Working with these kids was hella hard and required soooo much patience, but man oh man... at the end of the day one of the most rewarding jobs I have ever done. Unfortunately, the government from where I live cut the funding ENTIRELY for autism and underdeveloped kids. so it was difficult to find a job when I graduated last year. Not to mention I got rejected from maybe 2-3 schools, from which I wanted to pursue a master's. To make matters even WORSE this Covid-19 situation made it almost impossible to pursue my field.

Well fast forward a bit, I'm working at a call center for a really big bank in the Insurance Sector. I really do not like what I do, but I am grateful and fortunate to have a job especially when there are so many people getting laid off. Benefits are great, Pay is great, but the job really REALLY sucks. From this, my consumption of marijuana use really skyrocketed.

Really hopeless, I would smoke weed A LOT for two reasons mainly: (1) To cope with my situation on not finding my dream job (2) Bored out of my mind.

However, I did some self-reflecting and decided I wanted to re-live one of my other dreams. And that was to apply for the Police Services. I have to thank one of my best friends, who just graduated and got accepted as a Police Officer. He encouraged and motivated me to apply, indicating that I would be a great candidate.

I took a look into it, paid my enrollment fee. And I have officially started my Police Services Application.

Not to mention I've been off any marijuana substances for almost a month now.

To be honest, being sober is very very UNDERRATED. I have begun to have these wonderful dreams, that I have forgotten I used to have. Being sober, means being able to wake up motivated, and not have this foggy/overglooming cloud on top of your head all the time. I always felt tired, no matter if slept 5 hours, 8 or even 15 hours.

I will have to admit, few of the difficult things from going cold turkey are these massive headaches, as well as insomnia. But I'm sure it will eventually go away.

I am really glad and excited I've started this new journey for myself.

Sometimes, things don't work out and we look for a coping mechanism to help deter the pain.

I'm starting to learn to accept that pain, and not defer it to some sort of defense mechanism (Marijuana, Alcohol, yelling at someone).

All this has helped me become a better version of myself... and you know what?? its only the beginning

So I have a question for you guys? ""What motivated you to quit?""",1

I'm a hot mess of emotions but I've decided to accept that and roll with it.  I have a lot of emotional stuff I hid from by using weed for a long time so it's not a surprise.  I'm reading a lot about mindfulness and acceptance.  I created a lot of walls in the past and now I need to tear them all down and accept myself and my situation. My soul is working through all of that.  I can see good things are on the horizon, a better life.  But it feels like a lifetime of emotion hitting me all at once right now.",44

He knows that I’m quitting and even asked if it’s okay if he smokes (he is the kind of guy who would not smoke if I asked, be totally okay with it and not make me feel bad about it) but of course I told him I don’t mind at all. In fact I kinda wanted to face that challenge. Anyways he smoked a joint or two over the course of the few hours we hung out and I didn’t even feel an urge to have any! For the first time the smell of it was just a smell, nothing more nothing less! Actually smelled a little different than when I was smoking it myself, but wasn’t enticing! I just knew that I was better without. Previous times when I had tried to quit, this would have been really hard, but this time around something has clicked and I know in my heart that once I hit it, I will regret it!

It's been almost a year since I've drank alcohol and I barely think about it, I certainly don't miss or crave being drunk.  Weed was always ""easier"" on me so the thought of getting high tends to feel appealing more so than blackout drunk.

2020-05-19 15:35:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gmvjum/i_keep_coming_back_to_why_am_i_doing_this/,I keep coming back to: “why am I doing this?”,"Hear me out please, because I’ve battled with this endlessly and I can’t figure it out. I’m 2 days sober, couple weeks ago I was 1 week sober, and a couple years ago I had went on vacation and was sober for almost 2 months. I have a really complex relationship with weed. 

I’ve smoked since I was 15, and I’m turning 20 this weekend. I wanted to be done with it by 20, as I know brain development is key these years and I’ve probably altered enough of it already. If it develops till 25, I’d like to think I can go the next 5 years sober, as daunting as that is..

I think my history might help explain my complex relationship with it. I didn’t have the greatest childhood, parents both smoke cigs all the time, got divorced when I was entering high school and I guess you could say I felt pretty lost entering my teen years. At the age of 14 I told my best friend “I’m not sure if I know how to have fun, or even be happy, anymore”. I was constantly bored as a kid. Like, literally ALWAYS. Video games always got boring, I’ve binge watched almost every quality tv show throughout my teens, school was never a challenge for me, never the best at sports or music, and I never had too many friends. I fell in love with cs and philosophy in my past 2 years of uni (grateful for this, it gives me hope for the future), but before that (my teens) I really didn’t have any passions, my family never went places, and everything was really - dull I guess. Life didn’t seem very bright... until I smoked my first spliff at 15.

Everything changed. Life was bright. I could laugh again. I found friends that to this day are some of my closest friends. I started working, made money and smoked all the time with this awesome group of people I found. But, I did also use it to cover up unresolved pain. Also, I always hear about how people used to enjoy watching tv, but now they can’t without smoking (this goes for all activities, the idea that weed made everything more dull without its presents). The thing is, everything was already so dull before I had smoked. And it wasn’t going to change. Sometimes... I think weed saved me, I didn’t feel so alone, the world wasn’t so grey, and I had finally found people I could really resonate with.

Then uni came. At 18, I had started smoking alone, or with my brother. My group of friends slowly dispersed, and I was about to move to uni outside my city. I found a group of friends my first year but half way through they began to distance themselves from me, and didn’t feel like talking to me about it. Ended up moving in with them second year, then moving out half way through the year cuz I was living in hell. My past two years have been pretty hard, and that’s when I smoked heavier than I used to (didn’t think I’d get here). Used to smoke blunts weekly or every other day, now I hit B’s daily. Past two years are somewhat fuzzy I feel, and I think I did that by choice. I hadn’t felt so alone since I was 14.

So here I am. Sorry for the life story, but I hope it helps understand me more. Essentially, my mental health has never been the greatest, and I think that’s somewhat genetic (I can see the depression, social anxiety, and loneliness in my parents), life has never been easy for me, but I’ve learned life in general isn’t easy, just learned it young. I’ve learned to accept a lot for what it is. I’ve even accepted that I’m probably dependent on weed now. I also have studied neuroscience quite a bit, and understand my desire for weed has now become less of a “want” and more of a “need”.  Nobody likes relying on external sources for happiness. Thing is, all I remember from sober life is unhappiness, and I’m not just craving it, if so I would’ve not went back after vacation - I genuinely want it (similar to wanting to play basketball, read a book, or any other societal “normal” activity). Whether it’s 2 days, a week, or two months of sobriety, I just keep coming back to “why am I doing this?” “nothing will ever make me feel good as weed did”, and I honestly think it might be true. It’s a mental state, and it’s one that is unreachable in sobriety. And so far, sobriety doesn’t seem very desirable. Yea I got clarity, yea my memory might be more intact (debatably good if most memories aren’t that great), and yea maybe I’ll do better in my studies, but I’ll probably still feel like the world is dull. Unfortunately, cuz of daily smoking, it’s gotten pretty dull again, mostly cuz my tolerance is so high that I’ll get high for 10 mins after a small B and that’ll be it, just tryna make those 10 mins last. Then a few hours later take another hit of joy/euphoria, whatever u wanna call it... makes me feel better than sober. I’m afraid of the health damage, either way though I been second hand smoking since I can remember, sometimes I think that’ll do more damage then weed ever will. 

All I can see is a week go by, or a month, or even a few years, and I’ll just come to the same conclusions: “why am I doing this?”. I could take it day by day, like I’ve heard, but th Ben every day I jus ask the same. Everything and everyone screaming at me sayin it’s bad to be dependent on it. Guess I just don’t know if my life will be much better, I know others preach the benefits of sobriety, I don’t see them though :/. I read another post titled “rather be sober and sad than high and numb”. But I’m not numb - ok maybe some things are a bit numbed out - but man, I can do most things when I’m high and most things are much more enjoyable in that state of mind, why would I choose any other state?? I’ll just go back to my naturally depressed, anxious, lonely state of being - and let me tell you, the withdrawals do not help. I’m already an insomniac and I don’t eat very well, just makes me feel even shittier man. Maybe I’m a hopeless cause.",3

I had horrible insomnia from my ADHD meds, and I was tired of taking Ambien. Without any sleep aids, I just couldn't fall asleep. I could stay up 5 days in a row, but be wide awake. I was recommended to smoke some weed to help me with my sleeping problem. 

At first, it was phenomenal! I'd smoke a bowl, and knock right out. I'd get 8-9 hours of sleep every night and feel fine the next day. Fast forward 4 years, I was in the worst shape of my life. Mentally, physically, and emotionally, I was a complete wreck. I used to take good care of my physical health, but now I'm 100 pounds over weight. I was insanely depressed, but had no idea why. 

Weed went from something to help me sleep, to something that took over my life. When I first started, it was only once a day at night. Now? I would wake up, smoke a bowl. Stressed from the day? Instead of running, I'd smoke a bowl. I didn't even find joy in playing borderlands anymore. I just wanted to smoke weed, and watch the office all day. 

I constantly came up with excuses for myself. ""I need it to sleep. I need it for this headache. I need it for appetite."" 

I have no idea what came over me a couple of weeks ago, but I was laying in bed, and just felt mentally sick. I broke down and cried for no reason. I realized it was built up problems I've been stuffing away with weed. 

Weed went from a tool I used, to a crutch I relied on. I didn't care if I didn't get any sleep. I didn't care if my headaches were strong. I just wanted a change. I NEEDED a change. 

Today marks the two week period of me not smoking anything. Not even a single hit off my pen. I threw everything away, and I feel so fucking free it's amazing. I started going running again, something I used to do daily. I no longer get munchies at night. I no longer feel like I'm living in a shell. Since quitting, I've lost 12 pounds. 12 pounds in two weeks!! I feel so good damn Happy I have no idea how to express it, besides going running and letting those feelings flow through me. 

I owe so much of my success to this group. I thought I was weird for wanting to quit weed. All my friends told me I hadn't tried the right strain yet. Thank you all so much for your stories and encouragement. I feel enlightened.",9

2020-05-19 14:35:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gmudkq/something_ive_been_struggling_with_lately/,Something I've been struggling with lately,"Hey everyone - nice to meet all of you. I think this is my first post on leaves. I wanted to share something with you that I've been struggling with lately, and was wondering if anyone out there has had a similar issue. So just a little bit of background about me for context - I've used weed for about 9 years  - this is my longest time being sober (about 5 months) since I was about 13. I've struggled with it for what seems like forever - have tried to quit multiple times but never was able to.

As I'm sure a lot of you know or have experienced - when you quit your biggest enemy is your own mind. My thoughts manifest in a way that always end up sabotaging my desire to stop smoking. The thought that I've been struggling with lately has been the idea of cannabis as tool for spirituality or meditation. 

What initially prompted this chain of thinking was looking into Lord Shiva, a Hindu God that is considered to be the ultimate yogi (I come from a Hindu family so I grew up with various idols of Hinduism present in my life). Shiva himself used cannabis, and in Ayurveda, a holistic ancient Indian medicine and wellness system, cannabis is considered to be one of the five holy plants. All of this reading got me to the point where I started to think that using weed as a spiritual or religious tool was okay, and that I should get back into smoking for this reason. I realized that this was all just a manifestation of addictive thinking, which includes the way I was obsessively reading into this mythology in order to understand why Lord Shiva smoked weed. I haven't been able to let go of the thought that the ""real"" reason weed doesn't work for me is because I am not spiritual, holy, or ""clean"" enough to use it for my benefit.

I then started reading into Bruce Lee's marijuana use, which made me think again that I wasn't spiritual enough to use (in this case hash) to my benefit. 

To be fair though, this type of thought manifests in me in many ways, it just happens that I've been looking into spirituality and meditation lately. For example, if I see a successful or talented musician using weed, I immediately proceed to shit on myself by thinking that I am not artistic enough to use it wisely.

Or, if I see a successful businessperson using weed, I will think that I am not hardworking enough to use it to my benefit.

Or if I hear about geniuses who used it, like Shakespeare or something, I will immediately think that I am not smart enough to use it.

It just sucks because I've been looking into spirituality and meditation as a tool to find peace in sobriety, and learning that cannabis has been used as a tool for spirituality and meditation at deep levels, was very disheartening.

Also, I lied when I said I'd been sober for 5 months. I've been sober for about 6 months, but I didn't want to admit it because I thought that at 6 months I would have been a bit farther down the line, a bit stronger, a bit more clarity. For some reason a half-year seemed like an important milestone and that I should have been able to grow significantly by now. But the truth is I'm weaker now than I have been in a long time, and it feels like I'm getting weaker, not stronger. Sometimes I imagine hanging myself or shooting myself, and the only thing that makes these thoughts go away is imagining putting a blunt to my lips and taking a long drag. Which then makes me think that I'm taking life way too seriously, and that I should just smoke, because it's really not worth feeling suicidal over.

I want to say that I'm in a better place without weed, but the truth is I'm more lost than ever.",1

I've been a daily weed smoker for 5 years now, I'm 23 as of writing this. I always convinced myself that I was ok, I got shit done, that smoking 8 bowls of weed from a bong a day was ok. Well I've learned the hard way through CHS that this is not the case. These past two months I've been dealing with nausea and vomiting, at first I thought COVID but tested negative. It wasn't until I researched CHS about 5 days ago that I realized what I was doing to myself; what a terrible realization that was!

Still have the nausea and I'm sweating like a sinner in church, I have a general feeling of uneasiness and high anxiety. My appetite isn't there but I force myself to eat. I'm, 6'3'' and my weight has plummeted down to 148 pounds. I was worried I was suffering something more serious so I just got back from the doctor getting checked for kidney failure. Was relieved to get my blood and urine tested and assured that my kidneys are fine which makes me feel slightly better. 

These past few days I've started to realize how negative weed truly was on my life. To hear your Mom tell you it hurt her seeing me constantly baked and have it running my life was heart breaking. So much of my personal life has suffered from smoking. I've never been in a committed relationship, I don't have any real friends anymore, for the past year or so it's just been me and Mary Jane 24/7. I'm realizing that I have a serious addiction. On the bright side, this CHS is motivating me intensely as I hope to never have to experience ""scromiting.""

This has been hard, very hard but I also feel like there is literally no other option for me other than recovery. I'm supposed to go back to NOLA for school in September with a scholarship in music, and I don't want to ruin my potential career by being too unhealthy to keep stable relationships or even food down.  You only live one life and I'm done ruining mine. I'm fully expecting my symptoms to worsen before they improve, but I'm ready for the storm. Stay strong everyone.",3

It starts pretty much like how I imagine many people's usage of weed starts : in high school because my friends did it. It was great! This stuff really did the trick, and unlike alcohol, which I was already nearly dependent on, I didn't seem to develop an addiction for it, but rather simply a refined taste. I finally had an intoxicant that didn't *seem* to have any embarrassing or otherwise undesirable effects. Me and my partner could go out every weekend, hide under a bridge, and smoke as much weed as we wanted without fear of anything save perhaps spending a bit too much money on snacks at the gas station down the way. Even now, I still have many good memories of this time, of these times. There were some very happy moments I had while I was consuming marijuana. Moments where I felt more relaxed than any, moments where holding my partner somehow felt even *more* blissful than I already did with them.

This went on for some time, but things started to get... weird. First of all, my mom figured out that I was smoking weed, which really shattered her image of me. She isn't too moralizing about it, but she is a smart woman, and had detected things in my childhood and adolescence that signaled mental health issues including self harm, suicide attempts, etc. Hallucinations had also been a part of my life, and it seemed that they were becoming increasingly worse, but of course, this could in no way have any correlation with my marijuana usage. Impossible! It is a harmless drug, the stoners say. It's a plant (never mind that opiates come from flowers as well)! No D.A.R.E for me, I hate those Reaganite clowns! So, life went on, and continued on.

Things began to deteriorate with my partner. Not only did I cheat on them, but I also when high began to seemingly accidentally hurt them. I burnt them with my lighter once, and scratched their face another time. They were odd incidents, but I didn't correlate them with marijuana, even though I had never been physically abusive to them while sober. Then I was. One time, I grabbed their arm too hard. It was in jest, but they were a fragile person. My brain was falling apart, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly. I was prescribed Adderall by some moron doctor after I went in for psychotic symptoms, because he saw my grades were bad. The combination was making things worse. Life became a terror. I felt terrorized frequently, but never when I smoked, that was when I could get away from it all.

Then, one day, my partner and I were at their father's house. I decided to take edibles for the very first time. I began to laugh so hard, that I fell to the floor, and when I fell, I could feel my body being dragged on either side by some mysterious force. Then the terror. The sound of a piano being played in an ominous way over and over again. Trying not to scream. My partner dragging me up the stairs as I went deeper and deeper into the horror as my mind separated from my body. Once in their room, my mind began to separate from itself. I saw a ball of light, with a smaller one spinning around it, and then all at once I was aware of *nothing else*. Nothing. That was my universe. This clicking sound and this ball of light spinning around itself like some sort of atomic diagram. There was no me. My partner was not there. There was no Earth there were no people there were none of my 5 senses. Just this little feeling in the back of my head that I could never go back to reality. There has been, in my life, no experience quite like this. There are no words for the terror I experienced that night. The closest thing I am able to describe it as is ego death, although that always seems to lack sufficiency in describing my experience.

I woke up the next morning, with the terror fresh in my mind, and feeling... Different. This difference of not feeling really in my body lasted for two months. My partner and I broke up, I got a new partner, and still, the feeling persisted. Then one day, it went away. It was an awful feeling. I now know it as depersonalization, a common side effect of marijuana ingestion, and sometimes it could last even longer than it did in my case.

My exploring was not over though, for I was a marijuana connoisseur! Again, I tried edibles, this time correctly dosed. I admit, it was not as terrifying as the first time, but yet, that same insanity did come back and the same terror did as well, although simply slightly less taken out of reality. I woke up in my house, not aware of what had happened to me, but still feeling that terrified feeling in my bones. After this attempt, whenever I tried to smoke again, I would have horrible feelings now, even just smoking. When I turned my head, it would seem like it was ticking like a clock across the space. Tick, tick, tick. I don't know why, but it scared the shit out of me.

My last lost battle against marijuana came several years later. Dallas, Texas. My partner at the time decided to kiss me right after taking a dab pen hit. Now, I am fairly certain in my mind that my response was one of post-traumatic stress rather than actual exposure, but I freaked. I ran down the street, and was then admitted to the hospital and given ativan and sent home. Two days later, without any exposure to marijuana, I lost my marbles, and was put into the psych ward. My relationship was over. I felt like perhaps my life was too.

It was a long time before I felt any semblance of normal again. I lost 20 pounds at one time because I refused to eat, fearing marijuana was in my food. In the evening I would get this sense of paranoia that I was going to go right back into the ""high"" that I had experienced the first time I took edibles. This went on for months, but with the miracle of medication and therapy, it has subsided.

Today, I suffer from PTSD (from other things as well) and psychosis, created and exacerbated by my former THC usage. The smell of weed is able to send me into a near state of panic, and I always feel like a buzzkill at parties or gatherings. My partner today brushes their teeth before kissing me after they smoke or ingest any sort of THC products. I still, at times, fear that my food is somehow contaminated, and have to ask for reassurance. It is a difficult life, but it has gotten much better than it was.

If you read this far, I appreciate it. Remember, you can always quit, but you can't restart. You never know if you are someone predisposed to psychosis or other mental illnesses. I am not anti-marijuana or pro-marijuana, and I don't have a political agenda. All I have to say is that this shit *can* fuck you up, depending on your genetics. If this has happened to you, you are not alone, and I love you. You deserve help.

Today I am nearly 80 days clean off of mind-altering substances, and I have a relationship with my God that I could have never had before. I'm so thankful to be alive and happy and healthy.",12

I’ve read a few similar older posts where people are going through pretty much the same thing and was hoping someone could reach out and give me some advice/tips. 

So I started smoking weed when I was about 16/17, started off with a pipe and progressed onto bongs. At the time didn’t know it was referred to as “mokes/moles” (I’ve only recently discovered they had this name, I’ve always just called them bongs). I’m in the UK here and my friend just told me to “plug” the bowl with a bit of tobacco to prevent the weed pulling through. This was a life changing moment and the hit I got from the bong was amazing, which I presumed was the nicotine rush and the weed mixing in one hit.

So since then I’ve been pretty much hooked. I’m almost 21 now and have been smoking weed pretty much daily, I’ve always held down a job and it has never interfered with my work life but the only thing I look forward to during the day is going home and doing a massive bong rip. The rush I get from the tobacco mixed with the weed is amazing and I can admit that I am completely addicted to the rush. I know it’s nothing compared to heroin or crack addiction but I honestly feel like a junkie when all I can think about when I’m out is my next bong. It’s all I look forward to these days and everything I used to love just isn’t as exciting as it used to be. I have made bongs a permanent part of my routine; I’ll set myself goals/chores which will start with a bong and then be rewarded with a bong. I feel like a dog tricking myself with treats. The longest I have quit for is a week. It was extremely hard to begin with but after 4 or so days I did start to feel better and like I was more alive than ever before, I felt like I had rediscovered my personality and was “switched on” again. All it took was a few hours of boredom and I found myself with another bag of weed and high again. I’m not a nice person when I haven’t had a bong for a while and the only way I can calm myself down is the reminder that it won’t be long till I have another one. My mood completely switches and I don’t like the person I am becoming with this addiction. 

I am not blaming this on the weed in any way. I want to clarify that I do love the benefits of weed and it has helped me overcome a lot of things over the years, it also makes me see things in a different perspective and just makes me feel like an overall better person. I also see the health factors that it has for people all over the world. It helped me get off antidepressants that seriously fucked with my head and made me feel like even more of a zombie than marijuana does and so I unawarely replaced my antidepressants with weed and never looked back. I’ve been telling myself all these years what a better person weed is making me, however I can’t help but constantly think about the damage that the constant moles are doing to my body. I can’t seem to find any solid research into long-term usage to scare myself into not doing any more, however my mind and my body want completely different things. I love doing bongs and being high but the paranoia I’ve been getting afterwards sends me into a really bad place where all I think about is death and that the bong that I’ve just done is giving me cancer. 

It’s been trial and error. It’s like I know what I’m doing is bad for me but I just think of all of these excuses that will lead up to me doing another one and then I just think “Fuck it, I’ll quit tomorrow”.  It’s gotten to the point that I will scare myself into quitting, I think of the little research that has gone into smoking moles daily and I don’t put myself into a good place. I use gauze over my bowl to help the tobacco pulling through and to add a tiny (if any) amount of filtration. I would say I generally use a 40:60 tobacco to weed ratio but it really depends. I also use an acrylic bong which I know isn’t good, I do keep it clean and wash it regularly with with hot soap and water. I have used a glass piece before but I have broken every one that I purchased, so I stick with acrylic now just because I’m fucking stupid. 

I’ve tried to cut down and space out the hours between doing them, I tend to space them out over a few hours but I still feel bad about it. I tell myself that everyone has their habits, I try and convince myself that 5+ moles a day isn’t bad compared to drinking large volumes of alcohol daily or smoking packets upon packets of cigarettes a day. I still know what I’m doing is probably just as bad if not worse. It’s gotten to the point where I will absolutely need to do a mole and then after the hit I just feel like I’m killing myself even more. 

It wasn’t as bad before lockdown as I would be sober all day and not smoking until I came home, however I’ve gone back to my usual ways since and have been starting every morning with a bong rip and having another about every two hours after all throughout the day. 

I seriously need a wake up call, I keep telling myself that I’ll quit in the near future and my “addiction” won’t last forever but at this rate it’s going to keep taking over my life. I’ve tried substituting the bong hits with plain tobacco roll-ups as that’s what I used to smoke whilst at work, however now I find myself not actually wanting to finish them. The only satisfaction I seem to get is from doing moles. I’m going to try and eliminate the tobacco completely from my bong and see how I get on with just marijuana. I’ve read that people have struggled with this but I am willing to try anything to get me a healthier high. I find that I smoke even more when I roll blunts or spliffs so I’ve pretty much stuck to bongs. 

I love being high but I know none of it will be worth it if when I get diagnosed with lung cancer from constantly doing fuckin mokes in my early life. If anyone is out there going through anything similar or wanting to quit as well, please please please do not hesitate to message me as I would really like to be able to support each other and have that network of people going through something similar. I’m trying to cut weed out of my life and I’m so glad I found this group. If anyone is looking to make a support network/group for especially difficult times I’d be very interested.

I apologise for the absolute book that I have written, however I am pretty much a secret stoner so don’t have much of a network of people to vent to. A lot of this I’ve kept to myself the past few years as the friends that I do have who smoke aren’t really interested in quitting or don’t smoke so much that they would need to consider quitting. I’m sorry if a lot of this was me rambling! Any tips on quitting marijuana are really appreciated!",6

Now I have quitted smoking and I feel this way in all the time.

Quitting

I am writing this because I want to quit
Why now? Why like this? I couldn't tell you.
But I know I want to quit.

I am writing this because I want to break away from the AABB rhyme scheme,
to break away from traditions and boring routines,
To quit.

To quit acting like such a child, repeatedly making poor decisions and expecting to be forgiven so that I don't have to change
But I want to change, so I will channel my repetition into my words instead.
I want to quit.

Not to give up, not to defeat, fight back or surrender
but to shake off the self imposed shackles which had worn so long on my wrist, strapped to the bottle, that they had become comfortable
like cute fuzzy pink hand cuffs.
Distracted by novelty and blinded by pride I couldn't see clearly
But now I do, and you guessed it, 

I want to quit.

The first couple of days and nights were surprisingly easy (I cheated by having a couple beers as it was the weekend) - my sleep was ok ish and I generally felt motivated and proud of myself.

The past 2 nights have been awful though. The first horrible night I nightmared about people wanting to kill me and all I was doing was trying to avoid getting killed - I kept waking up every 2 hours sweating my bollocks off (my pillow was soaked and so were the sheets and duvet from all the sweat) - last night I dreamt of my ex with who we split up a couple weeks ago - we still talk and are friendly and are hoping to get back together when this isolation is over and that we re both happy in general before getting back together (I was emotional too codependent on her) - but it wasn't a nice dream and I woke up depressed and sad. Did some yoga and cried it out but I still feel a bit empty. Can't really concentrate on the work I'm supposed to do (for the charity I work for) and just feel physically weak.

I know this is all part of the process of giving up and I won't let this make me relapse. It's been way too much of a headf*ck to give up now.

This is what cleansing must feel like ! 

Anyway, I'm rambling now so I hope everyone has a nice day and best of luck to all of yous wanting to give up.

Tears in my eyes as I hope my words are true. 

Almost 7 years now the grip of weed has tightened itself around my life. For maybe 4-5 of those I have known it was a problem.

My best stint was 5 weeks and I thought I could handle a session after the effort of moving house, which was a mistake.

A year and a half later, I am here now, day 3, and have felt absolutely wonderful.
The only huge burden I carry is gone, I feel I am finally myself. I am again an active involved participant in the world, not hiding in my own foggy head land. I am here for those around me, no longer so selfish with my relationships being second to my weed use.

A few pivotal realisations occured during psychedelic use.
Seeing my weed use from an outside perspective,  abusive, out of control and basically pathetic. 
Recently realising I socialise only as a break from weed, just waiting to return to it's comfort. I am genuinely interested to know people and have neglected getting to know the new people in my life.


Tonight, Day 3 I thought about sourcing a sneaky joint after a tiring day, thinking it wont hurt, but deeply knowing it will.

I came here to convince myself otherwise and it has done the job. I am so very appreciative to have this community on this final attempt to quit.

Time to learn to relax without weed, nights are the hardest.

Congratulate me please!! plus: the good & the bad,"I hit 3 months a couple days ago and I wanted to make a post about my experience. This sub has been huge for me. This is the longest I've gone without weed (by far) in 5 years. The first month was hard, the second month was much easier, and the third month was kinda hard again so I'm really proud that I haven't relapsed.

The good:

* Bags under my eyes have disappeared! It took like 2 months but wow it's really true! It's crazy to think I didn't get a good night's sleep (with REM) for 5 years.
* Joy, creativity, hunger, sleepiness; these things come up naturally now, rather than needing to be smoke-induced every time. At first weed amplifies these things but with regular use it becomes the only way to experience them.
* I'm taking care of my teeth regularly.
* I watched the new Rick & Morty episodes without getting high; I don't think I've ever watched the show sober before but it was still really funny and I think it was easier to follow the story. It's freeing to not feel like I have to be high before I can watch a TV show or play a game.
* Short term memory is improved.
* Re-connected with friends/family members who don't smoke weed. It's easier to have spontaneous conversations and I feel like people are generally reacting to me better.
* Taking more walks during the day in pretty public parks enjoying the sun and people walking their dogs, rather than only at night to smoke in private.
* I feel more like myself; like who I was when I was young/before weed.

The bad:

So, for the reason you already know, this month I've been really depressed and struggling with daily functions. I had a week where I slept for 16+ hours every day. I started to think ""If I'm just sleeping and eating anyway, why don't I smoke?"" I made a post here about it and got some good support. Then hitting 3 months was kind of triggering; I felt like ""Haven't I proved enough? Isn't once every 3 months OK?""

I started thinking about weed a lot again, talking myself into relapsing and then talking myself out of it. That's the part of I'm sick of, thinking about weed all the time and letting it control my daily schedule.

I finally realized two things: one, what I remember about weed (the good times) isn't what I'll experience if I'm smoke again (I'll just be anxious and tired). Two, if I smoke once I'll be thinking about weed every day for like another month, and I really don't want that. So, I think I've accepted that 3 months is not an excuse to relapse. The urges are diminishing (for now at least).

OK, that's it. Thank you for reading. You can do this and it's so worth it!!!",325

Decided i wanted to reward myself with a dab cart smoke on the 8th day to celebrate and then return to another sober week. quickly, that one day turned into two, and now i have been smoking everyday for probably a month with a few successful singular day breaks at random points during the month. 

I can get through the day without weed and nicotine easy, in fact i feel great and energized, not 100%, but being sober definitely increases my mental clarity which for me is a very important factor to feel like my best self, the ability able to think with a clear head, and i like this aspect, despite the fact i might slightly crave weed or be experiencing some degree of withdrawal. Its the night time that really gets to me, 11pm and I have nothing to do and can't sleep and after about 8-12 hours of sobriety i know the high and buzz will be amazing. I could read or something instead, but of course I opt for the weed smoking, as my mind seems to drift to the weed every time, even though i know its a bad idea. Thats the weird psychological aspect to addiction. it Took a long time for me to understand, but for me, i am aware of my addiction and know that it isn't what i want but keep doing it anyway, like the thought to quit just gets pushed away in the moment, or i make a quick excuse as to why i should let myself do it one last night. The craziest part is whenever i say ""one last night"" I always do truly believe that i'll be able to smoke just one more night and have it be my last day, even though I've been through the cycle over and over, and know that it very well may not be true. And sometimes i'll say ""today is the last day"" and i do indeed stay true to that statement, but when that happens I usually only last a day to a week or so and its only every so often i have that kind of success. sometimes there is no secret ingredient, you just have to power through.

 Also, all my friends smoke weed and it is pretty much all they do, when i hang out with them they hardly talk and listen to the same rap music sit in the car saying ""what we gonna do"" until everyone gets bored and goes home, and it is very hard to find a source of entertainment sober when all your friends are high but hardly engaging in any activities.  So, to conclude this post, if there are any good tips or advice, things to keep me occupied, how to get through the thoughts and boredom, activities that i should try, how to sleep, limiting hangouts with friends for a short period, motivational speeches and personal experiences you would like to share, please do.

I used to enjoy weed a lot, but it has given me a lot of social anxiety, and when i quit for about a week, i really feel comfortable with myself and have loads of confidence and feel like i spread good vibes. Im usually a pretty positive person, and still want to smoke weed, just want to gain control over my habits because i think it is effecting my mental health. When using i have no motivation, passion for hobbies, or communication skills. I am Just kinda awkward and my mind is really stressed and scattered, it is hard to focus and pay attention for extended periods of time as well. i am often overwhelmed and too attached and caught up in irrational thought loops and emotions. have been using pretty much daily for about a 1/2-2 years or so have been smoking for 2 and a half years.",4

I sold the stuff when I was a kid so many friendships revolved around it. I was the plug. I had good stuff for cheap, and would beat many others out by simply having the best price.

I started selling to make money, but over the years this plant grew on me. People that came to me for pot started hanging around for a blaze up. I'd smoke all day with them and still get around to selling. By the e d of the day you can imagine I was just fried out of my mind.

This plant became like drinking water. I felt like I couldn't function without it. Days would start with smoking. I didn't even know who I was if I wasn't high. Entire days were just dedicated to smoking weed and selling weed. It made me happy to smoke people up.

Over the years I continued smoking it, not giving much thought to anything other than getting high. I became anxious and depressed. I questioned everything I did and felt doing weed at a young age caused me to develop in a weird way. To this day I still have anxiety issues. I have a hard time performing basic tasks most of the time and just feel nervous and scared in a funny way.

It is hard to fathom why I continued smoking for so many years. It is damn expensive and made me feel so nervous and off center. I think back to talking with others while high and remember cold sweats and anxiety engulfing my whole body. I think back to driving with drugs in the car and being shit scared but being high so that effect was amplified by the paranoia inducing side effects. I'm just happy to be done with weed.

With so many of my relationships revolving around weed it felt like a no brainer to smoke. It's funny in a way. Then I'd just be high and hit with the all too familiar anxiety, sweats and paranoia. My mind just playing tricks on my. For some reason I couldn't stop, I just couldn't get enough of the green stuff despite the paralysis it would strike into me. This was an everyday occurrence for many years. 16-25 so for 9 years I smoked so much weed and cigarettes.

Now it's a matter of recouping and rebuilding years of weak connections with others. These bonds are weak because high me is terrible at building rappor with others. This plant has literally griefstricken my family and my mental state. I literally can't do shit properly O's so it feels and my mind is constantly battling me it feels like. It's a case of psychosis, depression, anxiety and the weed was my way of medicating myself.

30 days ago I decided to stop. I feel problems, and not having the weed to fall back on means I have to face my problems head on. It's tough now but I hope it will improve as I tackle my problems head on and don't hide behind this plant or use being high as a way to forget my problems literally.",7

I feel even more confused now on what to do because I don't want to ask them to quit because it's not my choice to make and if their mental health is better how can I even bring up that their constant smoking makes me uncomfortable? How do I bring this up to them? If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it!",1

I can’t think of a single reason not to smoke that feels genuine.

In the last couple days of days the losses we’ve experienced as a result of lockdown have all really hit me at once - I miss my community at work, my toddler misses school and our extended family family and totally does not understand why, we can’t see my new niece. I feel so sad about it and I think weed would help me not care as much.

But I know it’s good that I care and it’s something that I have to face and that we all have to face and getting all numb and high wouldn’t help change anything and it wouldn’t make me feel better.

I have smoked wax carts virtually daily for a little under a year (I’m 18). I stopped a little under a week ago as I noticed my habit was taking a toll on my grades. Since stopping I’ve become disinterested in anything that I had previously done while high. I also completely lack any sort of motivation whatsoever, I can’t even muster the will to attend class, even though all that means doing is turning on my computer. I had an extremely vivid dream last night, which I didn’t realize was a dream until 10 minutes ago. I’ve been trying to mitigate these symptoms by using a cbd vape that I bought (no thc) but I’m not sure whether that is helping or just prolonging my recovery process. Any thoughts?",2
2020-05-19 00:12:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gmhg6v/hell_week_is_over/,Hell week is over,"After being high for basically 3 years straight, I finally managed to quit. It’s been 1 week since I’ve last smoked. 

Let me say, this was such a long week. My doctor told me to slowly quit. Start with smoking 3 days a day, to 2 times a day, to once a day. That was my game plan at first. 

But after talking with a few of you, you guys convinced me to quit cold turkey. I was hesitant at first, but I decided to. Let me say, I’m so glad I did. 

That doesn’t mean it was easy. The first 3 days, I didn’t eat anything. Any piece of food I would put in my mouth, I wanted to throw up immediately. I managed to eat about 4 bites of spaghetti in total the first 3 days. I lost 10 pounds in that time. I felt like crap every day. Woke up feeling so nauseous. I would go to bed literally shaking and sweating so much. It got so bad I almost called 911 cause I thought I was going to die. 

Anyways, here I am a week later. I have a small appetite now and can eat 3 small meals a day. I don’t shake anymore, I don’t feel sick all day. It was so worth quitting cold turkey. I can’t thank you guys enough. I can only imagine where I would if I tried to “ease of it” like the doctor said. I would probably be smoking every 30 minutes like I use to. 

Thank you all for the support and believing in me. It’s turned my life around this first week. Now that hell week is over, I can start taking bigger steps to bettering myself. 

So can you, those of you who are struggling to find a time to quit. Why not now? It’ll only make next week easier. I promise. Just stay strong and keep your head up. Pain is only temporary. 

I love this community and I am so thankful for all the support <3",4

I'm in a health professional program getting my doctorate, and I get A's and B's. I've been smoking daily (at night, usually just one bowl) for about a year, but I've been smoking regularly for the past 6 years.

I quit for a couple of reasons. First, because I have drug tests coming up. Second, I realized that when I smoke at night, I'm foggy and hazy during the day and I just float on by. At night I'm finally clear headed again, but then I smoke and I start the cycle all over again. Finally, it dawned on me that I may be living a less rewarding life because of my habit - and I couldn't even tell because I was too caught up in the fog. 

The first three days sucked. Lots of irritability and it felt like no dopamine was available in my synapses. After that, things got better. I feel really clear headed and more aware. It's crazy how unaware I was living the past years. I was truly blunted (pun intended). In addition, I have emotions back! I didn't even realize I had been missing them. Both good and bad emotions are back. 

The bad emotions are obvious. Sadness and anxiety. It's hard to explain it, but it feels kind of nice to have these emotions back. Sadness is such a core part of the human experience, and I had been numbing myself to its existence. Well, sadness is back and it's hard to deal with. I cried at a red light today for god's sake. I was very tempted to smoke again, but I pushed through the cravings. 

The good emotions are also back, though. Emotions like excitement, surprise, and curiosity. I fooled myself into thinking weed makes me more curious and investigative. That hasn't been true for the past two years as I get baked and simply do mundane things like chores or just watch Twitch. I used to play piano, read, do math for fun, and learn about curiosities that intrigued me. 

Maybe one day I can toke in a very sparing way. For now I am very happy to be away from cannabis as my use was detrimental to my higher level of functioning and existence.",8

I've slipped up a little bit here and there but every time I kept running it through my brain that I'm done, I don't do this anymore, it's over. Honestly quitting sucks and it's really hard but I look back on the past year and I'm genuinely ashamed of who I was beforehand. I'm grateful I got the chance to clear my mind and discover how my lack of coping methods, as well as my lack of responsibility when I first started experimenting, really fucked me over. While I still feel guilty for who I was before, I don't spend every day thinking about weed anymore and I'm able to start loving myself as is.

One thing that always triggered me is references to it on social media and movies, so now I hide posts that reference it, delete or unfollow people that are heavily involved in that 420 culture, and avoid watching shows and movies that I know will have tempting imagery in them. It's helped me a lot to keep it out of my line of sight. My boyfriend's family is pretty weed-friendly and making it clear to him that im done with this phase of life has helped immensely. Having someone outside of myself there to say ""no you don't need it"" is often the little push i need to remain committed to sobriety.

I'm not afraid of my parents smelling me anymore, I'm not afraid to let my sister borrow my car, I'm not hiding anything in my backpack, and I no longer live in fear of being caught by my family. Plus, I've saved about $1,800 that I would have spent on weed.


So yeah that's about it. If you're just starting, I hope you push through. The beginning is the hardest part, honestly and truly. Before you know it this phase of your life will be just another memory. If you want to do this, you'll find a way no matter what.",24

I feel like I’ve lost my personality and I’m like an empty shell, I don’t even know who I am anymore, I’ve ruined my relationships with most people because I just always feel frustrated and don’t want to hear what anyone else has to say but then when I get off the phone I question myself like why the fuck did I just do that, why was I so horrible to someone who I care so much about. 

I’ve been 2 days no smoking so far and I just can’t sleep and feel like I’ve lost all my emotions, after reading some of the posts on here I’m feeling more positive on that I can get through this and start rebuilding my relationships with people and get my life back on track.

I dunno I just don’t even know what I’m interested in anymore, I always came to the conclusion that if I’m going to do something then I’ve got to have a joint first or it won’t be fun, I just want to be excited about something again!

I stopped so that I could find a better more lucrative job. I currently work at a truck stop and am exposed hundreds of people every day and during covid19 this is not good. Half the truckers have very bad hygiene habits and most don’t wear masks and the company won’t allow us to refuse service. This has given me extreme motivation to quit to get a better job. Which has made quitting quite easy actually-suffering at work is worse than suffering over no pot- I’ve gone through dry spells in the past when I’ve felt burnout but over the last 3 years it’s been a bit harder to slow down because I really didn’t want to. I can’t say pot has destroyed my life or caused me to lie, or ruined relationships but it has caused me to get too comfortable in work situations where I should have moved on sooner than later. I have a good job prospect and a friend in the company. 

In short if you really want to stop you have to stop because YOU really want to. You have to find a real true motive. Just quitting to quit is very stressful and difficult. I know I’ve been there. Smoking pot is part of who I am and is something I enjoy so I will be going back in the future but for now I’m clean and its going well!

2020-05-18 18:29:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gmbtn5/marijuana_induced_psychosis/,Marijuana induced psychosis,"Hey all, new to this forum and this is my first post on this reddit account. Anywho;

I recently decided to stop using marijuana after 4 years of consistent use. I began using marijuana to cope with anxiety and depression when I was a teenager, but it gradually grew into more of a bad habit and mental dependency. I never wanted to admit it out loud but I knew deep down that I was overly dependent on smoking weed. 

So fast forward to 2018. I had my first ever panic attack. I smoked a few puffs of a blunt and spiraled into one of the darkest moments of my life. I thought I was dying. I couldn’t breathe and I was hyperventilating. My husband was with me the whole time, trying to calm me down and assure me I was fine but I thought I was dying. I was screaming for him to take me to the ER and we got in the car and began driving there. After we started driving around, I rolled the windows down, got fresh air and slowly began to come down from the panic. I felt way better and ended up not going to the ER. The same thing started to happen the next time after that I smoked (days later), but I calmed myself and swore off weed. 

It didn’t last, and weeks later I was smoking again. I started slowly, once a day, and gradually it increased to multiple times a day all the way up until the end of April 2020. In September/October of 2019, I experienced some small scale panic attacks, but it was nothing like the one in 2018. I talked myself down and continued smoking daily. 

Around February of this year, i switched to straight wax and began dabbing instead of smoking flower. I felt like at times I was frying my brain but I literally didn’t want or feel the need to stop. I was like a zombie. I didn’t feel many emotions or have really any memory of little things through out the day...honestly typing this out makes me realize how ridiculous it had gotten. My husband told me I looked dead in the eyes and that really scared me. I decided to quit smoking, but part of me wanted to deny that marijuana was actually having this negative of an effect on me, so I half ass quit. In other words, I smoked maybe once or twice daily as opposed to every couple of hours. 


So April 29th, my friend came over, and my husband rolled a couple joints. I puffed the joint twice and it sent me into (what I now know to be) psychosis. It was like the flip of a switch. I sat alone in a bed upstairs and began to have a sensory trip. I started feeling objects with my eyes closed in order to prove to myself that what we see is not real but what we feel is (if that makes sense). It was like I entered an ASC (altered state of consciousness). I can play piano, so I went downstairs and began playing, but I let my hands guide me and began playing shit I have never played in my life. I play by ear and chords, I don’t read music and I normally don’t play melodies, just chords....so I was literally just playing all sorts of insane pieces, both hands, melodies and chords that my brain was making up. It was the best I had ever played. It was both the most awesome and paranormal experience i have ever had in my life. I began thinking I was having some type of awakening. 

Fast forward to that night, I felt something in my ear. It felt like it needed to pop. I plugged my nose and tried popping it to no avail. It got worse and long story short, I was convinced I had something weird going on in my head. From there, I spiraled. I was really freaking out, and my husband was convinced I was having a panic attack again. He was really irritated at this point and was not being nice at all. He was calling me crazy and basically was like “you’ve done this before and been fine, I really think you need to chill”. I felt like he was conspiring against me, wanting me to die, and all of these other delusional thoughts. So I called my mom freaking out and she drove me to my pcp (primary care physician). I actually did have fluid behind my eardrum, but that was just the beginning. 

From that day on, I was convinced I was dying. I heard voices telling me I was a horrible person. I had intense visual disturbances (Seeing figures, light flashes, floaters, etc.). I was experiencing weird tingling sensations on alternating sides of my body. I thought maybe I was getting karma for being a horrible, mean person. I began to become overly sensitive to things I had never thought twice about. I honestly mentally lost it. I stayed with my mom for almost a week, spending the majority of that time in her bed. I literally slept in the bed with my mom because I was so scared. I couldn’t turn my brain off. I was physically unable and scared to sleep. I felt like I would not wake up. I was also having a multitude of physical symptoms that began to manifest. I began experiencing depersonalization. I felt like I was observing life from a third person pov. I lost a drastic amount of weight in only a few days. I hadn’t been eating well to begin with, but I began not eating at all. I wasn’t keeping up with my hygiene like I normally do, i wasn’t cleaning my house...it was honestly so dark. I would see birds flying and I was convinced they were messengers and were trying to tell me something. 

I went to the ER finally and basically got laughed out once they established that I wasn’t physically dying (although I had ketones in my urine and weighed 108 at 5’7”). I called my pcp and scheduled an appointment for later that day. She did a more thorough exam and blood panel and was very sweet as she explained to me that physically, everything looked fine and she did not think I was dying. I finally began to calm down. I explained to her my mental symptoms and she told me that basically I had worked myself into such a panic, that I needed to begin to work myself down. I felt better after talking to her, but still very anxious. As i began to talk myself down, crazy depression set in. I began to wonder what the point to life was. Why am I here? Why is this happening to me? What point is there to continue to live if this is what I am going to feel like? I was scared my brain was permanently toast. I will say, time has flown by through all of this. Almost too fast. 

Fast forward to now. I am feeling better but I definitely have PTSD. I haven’t smoked weed since this happened, and probably won’t for a very long time. In the mornings, since this has happened, I am very nervous and stressed upon waking up. I wake up in a state of depersonalization and it takes me way longer than usual to adjust to reality and start my day. Once I get around people and talk, I feel better and better, but through out the day, I occasionally catch myself starting to slip into a wormhole of fear and unwarranted anxiety. I talk myself down and so far it has been successful. I still don’t feel 100% better. More like 80%. Anyways, reading other people’s stories on reddit has helped put my experience into perspective. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I feel like most people can’t relate, but if anyone can I will find them here. Sorry this post is so long, but it’s literally weeks worth of an experience consolidated into a single post! 

Any advice and/or stories are welcome. Anything to help me not feel so alone.",15

I've been trying to quit smoking for a couple of years now. I think what is so difficult for me is the fact that my pot addiction goes hand in hand with my eating disorder. 

I dont act out EVERY time I smoke pot which is really messing with my head. ""If i could just get a hold of my eating disorder then I wouldnt binge when I smoke."" By act out I mean binge eat and then do some sort of behavior to 'cancel out' the binge, whether it means starving myself or over exercising. 

It is difficult to even talk about this because I can already see the comments about ""make sure you just have healthy food in the house"" or ""eat before smoking"" but with an eating disorder, it is much more complex and devastating than that. Something in my brain switches of when I smoke weed and I go right back to square one with my eating disorder. I am not talking about the munchies here, I am talking about a whole different animal. Its like 5,000 calories consumed in a couple of hours in a way that is completely compulsive, like an out of body experience. 

I'm definitely playing Russian roulette every time I get high (every day), and I just cant shake off the feeling that it MIGHT not be impossible for me to fully recover from my eating disorder and continue to smoke pot. Am I delusional?",5

I cant excersize for another few days until I heal, and I can seem to just enjoy things anymore because I keep feeling like shit. I broke down last night and cried so hard I was hyperventilating. I started thinking about life and how unhappy I am and how hard it is. It was so overwhelming. Today I took some ibuprofen for the pain but my brain really wanted (wants) to go to the dispensary and buy an edible.


I didnt. And I wont. I just wish I could sleep the next month away. I don't really know how to deal with anger. I was never angry before. I used to be so calm and chill and easy to get along with. Now I find myself getting so mad and literally everything and I know the reasons I'm mad are stupid but that doesnt stop the anger. 


You know the little voice in your head that you push down? The one that says all the negative stuff that you know isn't true but it's there in the back of your head every day.

I know all I can do is take one day at a time and I do have a plan for my future, it's just put on hold because of covid. I know I need to give myself a break. The voice is just so loud lately.

Way less then i did before so I thought well it's okay if I do it in the weekends or on holidays. But now I'm smoking again after work and I kinda feel let down in myself for it. So I hope with typing it out I just get that little extra kick on my behind, because the thruth is that weed is just a bitch ass drug and it ain't that great. Yes, I had fun with u in my teen years, but looking back I know I missed so much because of it. And I don't want to much anything else. I'm 28 right now and I want this new chapter in my life and don't be stuck in the old one

The pros of being clean were so much better in those 2 months then the pros of being stoned now. It feels harder to quit now then in the beginning of this year, but I'm just gonna start at day 1 again and this time I'm keeping to it

2020-05-18 15:07:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gm7vfm/so_i_ran_out_of_weed/,So I ran out of weed.,"Deliberatly. Yes, I did bargain with myself to finish my stash rather than bin it. I just despise waste, sorry.

I've been thinking for a while that I rely on weed too much to regulate my emotions. Honestly, I'm pretty sure I have substance abuse disorder. Weed is the last thing I'm down to. I haven't taken any uppers or benzos outside of a music festival for a couple of years. I quit alcohol for good 90 days ago. For the last decade I've always had an ""out"" availible to me. A way to change my state of being quickly because being alive can feel like too much to bear.

So, I want to learn how to handle difficult emotions on my own. And I have to, because its either learn how to deal with my existence - in which a lot of deeply unfair, horrible things have happened - or... rely on drugs my whole life. I don't want to rely on drugs my whole life.

I'm doing this now because I think I'm in the best position to I have ever had. I have a safe place to live. I'm on universal credit (don't abuse your kids, folks, it will disable them.) so I am not stressed about work / research / presentations etc. I have an understanding support network of friends. I've done a lot of ground work in mental health recovery and feel strong. I don't want to die. For the first time in my life I don't have the background sense that I won't be around for much longer. 

This is day 1 I guess. I didn't habitually smoke all day, but the evening is daunting. I'm shaking like a leaf just because I'm scared of having a flashback and not knowing what to do with it. I wonder if I should be taking away another coping mechanism in the middle of a global pandemic. I wonder if that's just addictive voice talking.

I'm not sure what my point was, think I just wanted to ramble a bit about where I'm at. And how... Scared I am.",7

Little background: Im from Tunisia. We only have lowquality or medium quality expensive hash. You can go 1 year jail for smoking but now it has loosen up a bit as it seems everyone is a stoner but it s because our society is fucked up and you have pretty much nothing to do.

I m currently 28 y o and was offered my first joint at 16. At first it was cool and helpful. I was sleeping right and no more depressed. As I grew older I found my self trapped in a circle of waking up, finding out where and how to buy hash and finally going home smoking alone. Not doing shit with my life. Although I managed to finish my licence degree in sciences but that kind of diplomas don t get you jobs here. My friends are all stoners and really they are not best quality friends I have no lawyer doctor or any good citizen friend. I m lazy and cannot complete anything I start. I had what you call abusive parents but here they re called loving parents. Now I used to smoke 1 gr of medium quality weed a day. Maybe it s not too much THC and that s why I dont feel anything on my 3rd day without. Im normal just sleep deprived. I see clearly now and I feel like Im awake. I no longer fear being alone in the dark not sleeping. I just thing about something to do with my life. Problem is I ve spent so much time and money on shit hash that I forgot what I like. What I want to do? When I was younger everybody told my parents I was a genius and an artist. But Im no longer this anymore. I feel stupid. I don t remember anything because all my days were the same for years. I did nothing good with my life beside the potential I had and I lost it all. 
Now I m good at anything I m willing to concentrate and do because I like details and I m a perfectionnist. I think I like baking and nail art enough to make one of them my job. But again I find my self thinking about two things in the same time, not focusing and certainly not doing anything to start one or another. It  seems like I didn t stop smoking. I m I just trash or what? I m all day on my phone not doing shit and I m not smoking anymore, also I don t feel anything has changed but my sleep.  Like I m not even mad or stressed or frustrated. 


Im sorry if it s too long but I needed to share with you all. Keep going folks because when I read how much you used to smoke and for how long I understand it s a lot more difficult for you all to stop. But no matter how much or how often I wish you all good luck and strength.",2

Due to unemployment from COVID, since the beginning of lockdown I was sitting at home with my oil rig and torch hitting it 24/7. My neighbors in my apartment complex probably think I’m a crackhead from the noise lol. 

Have experienced all the withdrawal symptoms people describe on this sub. Hot/cold flashes, intense nausea, overwhelming anxiety, difficulty with eating, unable to sleep, etc.

Each day has been maybe like a 5% or 10% reduction in symptoms. 

Was looking for something light to eat and saw some cannabutter in my fridge I forgot about. First thought was, “just take a little to get rid of the withdrawals.” 

Then I thought about how I’ve been down that rabbit hole before. I’m unable to moderate my usage. So I dumped the cannabutter down the sink.

I almost made it two weeks being sober but then I caved. I smoked two grams in the span of four days. What made me cave? The nostalgic feeling of smoking on my balcony in nice weather. Even though I know how detrimental marijuana is for me, I ignore it. The funny thing is I was put in two situations where I could've easily called up my dealer and cop a gram but I didn't, I talked myself out of it. What was different this time? \*throws hands in air\*   


Weed doesn't work for me while I'm in this state, maybe socially in a few years but I want to be sober. I want to live a sober life and have nothing that hurts me controlling me. I'm done suppressing. I'm done having no motivation, no money, no friends. I'm over it. I've been over it. Where do I go from here, tho? This quarantine is fucking me up! I'm bored and just want to smoke and play Sims. But that's unhealthy, right?  


I'm extremely disappointed in myself for more reasons than one. I have a court date to receive unsupervised visits with my children and they gave me 7 months to be clean. So, when I go back in July I'm supposed to be clean clean. Then it's like I'm 200 pounds and 5'2, so I'm not sure how that's going to play out but I'm trying to train my brain to think positively about the situation. It's just so hard man and I'm just lost on what to do.  


Before this, in 2018 I stopped for two months and then went back and stopped again for a month then went back. All for different ""reasons"" but yeah. So, I realized about two years ago that I do have a serious substance abuse problem but this is getting so out of hand. It's causing me to have the belief that I lose all my power when it comes to weed. That I'm in an abusive relationship with it. No matter how I try to get away, it always finds me. It'll be good for a few hours then it beats me down.   


Suffering from borderline personality disorder, anxiety and depression doesn't help at all. But I have faith, that's one thing I do have if I have nothing. I do believe I can overcome this as I have seen many people do. We're all different but a little motivation can go a long way. If you have any encouraging words for me, feel free to leave them below.

Two weeks ago I decided I wanted to smoke a joint (after 86 days of not doing it) so I bought 10 grams since it was the smallest amount my dealer was selling due to the covid isolating, I smoked a joint at Sunday night and it felt horrible, however, I did it again on Monday and Tuesday, and again until it was Sunday again, I never really enjoyed it but everytime I smoked I was expecting to feel like it felt before. Then on Monday I smoked very little, and I enjoyed it, I started smoking one or two hitters during the day and by Saturday I was smoking all day. So yesterday I flushed all the weed I got left (around 5 grams) and decided that it has to stop. I think I may realize this have to be the last time I smoke in my life, but I don't want to believe it ...

I went to the ER on the 2nd, the next few days were terrible withdrawal symptoms, bad sleeping stomach pain sweating and insomnia etc. Then for the last week and a half I've had severe shortness of breath. I forced myself to go out and walk/run as much as I could every day, anywhere from 10k-17k steps each day, and I completely overhauled my diet, eating more veggies and fruits and actually cooking food instead of frozen stuff and pizzas all the time. And breathing was really difficult, not sure if it was my lungs recovering or withdrawal anxiety or what... but over the last couple days I've noticed it's gotten better. This morning is the first time I've been able to breathe normally in almost two weeks.

If anyone's going through bad times quitting weed like I did, I'm almost positive YOU WILL BE FINE! I thought I was going to have shortness of breath forever, like I gave myself COPD or something, but as of today I'm feeling amazing. It's been the final hump in overcoming withdrawal and I feel awesome. I hope I'll be able to get back to running a full mile without stopping soon. I feel like a new me.

I would come home 
You'd be there waiting
I would put you in a cone

And eventually made me crazy
I became emotionally unstable
And that became too much to handle

8 years later, I have to say goodbye

Tired and having severe anxiety attack,"To give you a little background about my situation; on May 6 I had a random UA drug test from my employer that I've been with for 3 years with good record, I tried to give synthetic urine but was caught by the clinic, gave them my real one that I knew will test positive, and now I'm getting calls from a Medical Review Officer from work. I'm on day 5 from not consuming THC. It's my first try to quit but I've had long streaks of not using for the sake of T-break only. For the past 4 days I've come to the realization that 5 years of continuous use of THC helped me go through life's hardships, but it also made it so hazy that my timeline seems warped. It feela like the past 5 years didn't happen or that it did but it seems a lot shorter than that. 

I've been planning to quit for a while, actually since the new year. Smoking hasn't been the same. It's causing more of a downward spiralling feeling and I got exhausted from going through the process of smoking. I slept all day and all evening and when everyone is asleep I would smoke in the bathroom between 2am until 5am then passout by 6am or 7am; rinse and repeat. It wasn't helping my anxiety or depression anymore. I knew I needed help when I felt like my relationship with THC had turned sour. For someone who doesn't have health insurance, I didn't know what to do so I kept on using to manage but the random drug test was the straw that broke the camel's back of my love affair with weed. It caused so much stress that I broke out in hives and made me sob nonstop for a day or two. I was done.

Now I'm on day 5, it's brutal, exhausting, the dreams are crazy, my diet is okay, i only eat natural foods like fruits, vegetables, and the staple of our meal as asians, rice and protein, fish or chicken. I'm still practicing proper hydration; ice water is my new favorite, and also decaf iced tea. I do my regular 20-30minute walk with my dog everyday. I know keeping a routine will stabilize me but since I haven't talked to the medical review officer from work yet, I've been getting this anxiety fits for the past 5 days and most of the time I'd reach for the pipe and smoke to manage. Not anymore. I chose not to do so but its brutal. I'm calling them today and just go through the whole shaming and ostracism from work. I feel like a house of cards falling apart. Day 5 only and I'm having a rough time.

TL;DR: on day 5 of not smoking, work is in jeopardy from positive UA drug test, having severe anxiety attacks, no health insurance to help with mental health issues, I'm exhausted beyond belief.",1

I decided to quit just after the new year, it's been over 4 months now. My head is so much clearer, I can focus better and my memory is getting better. But this has had a downside, because now I see the damage I've caused to not just my own life, but the others around me.

I'm about to turn 41, I've alienated myself from all the people I once had in my life. I've lost my partner, who was the best thing to have ever happened to me, through inaction and being lazy, inconsiderate and completely selfish. Because of this I no longer get to live with my beautifully incredible son which hurts every day that I have to leave him behind to go home. I've closed doors in my life that I'm not even sure I can open again. Over 20 years of this habit all I've done is create my own prison for myself, all I wanted to do was get home from work, get my son to bed and get high watching television. I neglected the most important people in my life time and time again, through the money spent and time wasted I took their right to a happy, fulfilled family and smoked it. At the same time I neglected my mental health, I spent years with crippling depression and anxiety, not even thinking that all I was doing by smoking was making it worse. I created masks for myself to hide my mental health, I hid lifelong conditions that I didn't realise I even had because being high all the time did a great job of keeping me from realising my issues. These masks I made for myself have been hard to take off, but I'm glad that I have done.

Over 4 months in and I'm never going back, I'm receiving therapy again to deal with the regret that I've left myself with, the biggest being not doing this sooner when the people around me were ringing the alarm bells as loud as they could. If I'd paid attention to the people that loved me I wouldn't have to go home at night and look at my walls, with nothing but the deafening silence of all I've lost ringing in my head, instead of the alarm bells from the people I love trying to warn me when I wasn't listening.

Despite the failures and the regrets that I've caused myself, I'm sure that I will get things back on track again. I can't quite just hit the reset button, I have to deal with what I've created, but I can try and start a new chapter for myself. Thanks for listening.",376

Was in a shitty mood this afternoon. Missed second group, felt shittier, which turned into manically cleaning out old books, and getting them ready to go to the dump's ""take or leave"" area. Hundreds of books ive collected over the years, which im unlikely to ever read again. I had planned on selling them, but... i just dont have it in me to go through and index every single one.

the shame is, a lot of those books were star wars books that my mum collected for me, before passing..  almost every dragonlance, ravenloft, Dean Koontz, tom clancy, tanith lee, asimov, niven, etc.... but... i just dont have room for them.

Found a bunch of old pictures, threw some out, a grade 2 yearbook, some crappy drawings.... But...  when i look at a lot of them, i dont recognise myself. It scares me,  but i guess thats what happens after years of substance abuse.

my dad noticed the hookah in the car. he asked about it, and I was straight up. I like to go for drives, then smoke out in the middle of nowhere for a bit, just enjoying the serenity. He knows I would never use it for weed.
.though, im waiting for the moment when the cops pull me over and use it for an excuse to search my car, or drive by me on the side of the road and decide to stop.

I was thinking of taking some equipment out to the middle of nowhere, and do some recording, or even just take a sketchpad, and (fail horribly at the first 9000 times) draw what i see. 

Honestly, I'm terrified. Rural crime is super fucking high. If I try to set anything up on any road, even / especially, a trunk road, I'm likely to get carjacked at gunpoint. Last winter, a cop stopped to help a vehicle stuck in a ditch, got shot, and had his cruiser stolen. Cruiser almost drove straight into me, while I was driving to the city for physio, from being hit by a completely unrelated stolen car a week earlier.

as much as id like to go out and do creative things on my own, in beautiful and scenic areas, this overbearing anxiety just floats around. I used to lie to myself and say weed helped. But instead of being anxious about being jacked, I would be locked in my garage, anxious about everything else.

bleh. 

The only easy day was yesterday.
just gotta keep reminding myself this is better.

Cont:

Maybe its because I was already in a bad mood, but feel like a pile of toxicity right now. All I want to do is sleep, or smoke so i can sleep. Follows, a bunch of bad words. 

Stupid >!fucking!< dog keeps trying to kick me off the bed. 
Stupid >!fucking!< cat keeps coming down stairs and stupid >!fucking!< dog keeps barking and chasing her up stairs. Other stupid >!fucking!< cat keeps headbutting me in the head, and purring, and rubbing herself against my  >!fucking!< face.

""yelling"" about it... helped. But damn, I am super duper glad I dont have access. Or I would be smoking right now.

Remind myself this is better.

Its all good though, really I just have to learn how to deal with this better. That takes time, and being in situations that cause stress. Of course that doesn't exactly help when emotions are swelling. That said, they wont be swelling as much next time, or the time after.",5

First was to hug myself and tell myself one thing that is good about me. Second was to look in the mirror and tell myself I loved myself. Third was to meditate, but I did this in a bubble bath with a podcast for depression meditation (worked out great). Fourth was to read 1 chapter of a book on overcoming guilt and shame. Fifth was to forgive myself (this will take work). And the sixth was to not smoke. 

I accomplished all of them. I haven't ever told myself I love myself. I haven't ever complimented or hugged myself. (Yeah sure, pat on the back happened once in a while but it never felt real). I haven't gone one day without smoking leaves in the past 15 years. But today I did it.  I actually did it. I can't wait to wake up tomorrow, where as yesterday I didn't even want to be alive. 

I had to tell someone and this group is what motivated me in the first place so I thank you all. It has been a very dark path for me and I'm hoping if anyone else struggling with mental health and addiction can benefit from making a chore chart and they can find some relief too. It felt amazing checking off everything. The hardest wasn't the leaves, it was telling myself I loved myself.  It's not easy and this is very new to me. It cost me nothing but change.

Overall feeling pretty good, but one thing I noticed was that I’m having a ton of anger that I can’t control. I’ve been raging over the past couple of days and over things that shouldn’t be a huge deal. 

I used to have a lot of anger issues as a kid/teen, but that sorta went away when I started smoking weed. Every time I would smoke it would chill me out and I would sort of just suppress my anger/not care about the stuff that was angering me anymore. It seems like all that suppressed anger is coming out. 

I really need to control it, though, as I’m causing stress to my parents and causing a toxic relationship with them. I contemplated smoking again, but what’s that gonna do other than prolong this, right?

I am at 56 days sober today, and around this time is where I tend to have the “relapse before the relapse.” I’m trying to curtail it, but I’m really struggling to continue my routine. 

I have been walking an average of 15,000 steps everyday (broken up into two walks), and I just have no desire to do it. I just feel like laying in my bed sleeping. The good news is my irritability is almost non-existent. I feel calmer and clear-minded, but I feel restless and tired (if that makes any sense). I’ve been trying to keep up with cleaning my bathroom and my room (I still live with my parents), cleaning my animals cage (I have two sugar gliders), meal prepping for the week, learning to cook, doing laundry, working full-time, and trying to stick with this medical coding course that’s after work three nights a week. I have not been doing my homework, and I just want to dropout even though I’m almost at the end. I don’t know how “normal” people do this and feel okay to have a social life, do fun activities, and be happy. 

I wonder if l’ll ever have a job making more than $13 an hour. It would be nice just to make $20 an hour, but it’s not happening with this economy. I also wonder if I’ll ever find a job I like. Medical billing and coding is beyond boring. I went in the field to get away from the public (which I did), but the work itself is pointless. The problem is finding something I’m interested in, doesn’t deal with the public, and is engaging. I went to college and graduated with a Management degree, but that was a waste. I didn’t know what I wanted and went for something “practical.” I wish I would of went for something interesting and fun, like the humanities, psychology, and sociology. Even though I’d still be in the same position, I’d at least have something worth knowing about. 

I just want to find inner peace, a job I like, and stability.  Thanks for reading and have a great week.",4

31st of March i decided it was enough. I'm 22, and have smoked on a daily basis since i was 17. For a long time i was what i thought was a """"productive stoner"", But in the end it just made me slower than i could be, less social then i could be, more turned to myself then i should be.

It went okay the first week. Then the second week came, and with that, all the emotions that had been suppressed for that last 5 years as well. Sleeping was shit, i cried everyday, and didn't know what to do with myself. It was shit and after 16 days i kinda broke and smoked. Smoked on my normal level, so ended up smoking about a gram that day. After that day i realised there was no way back to my old ways. i hated how slow it made me, and how i immediately went back to not wanting to see my flatmates.

So the journey continued. It's been tough. I cried a lot. Had a lot of realisations about myself. I'm realising that i'm a new stage in life and that quitting me was the final step in allowing myself to fully flower as a person.

I am so happy to have discovered this community. For the past 3 years, I have smoked weed everyday consistently. At first, I was using it as a way to cope with a period of time in which I suffered from panic attacks in the morning, but I honestly liked it so much that  over time, it became recreational. Up until 4 days ago, I was smoking about 4+ times a day. The thing I loved about weed was that no matter what I was going through (dealing with an alcoholic family member, my dad being in the hospital for several months from a brain infection, etc.), I had something to instantly make me feel better. I think it’s safe to say that weed was my security blanket- something I could always rely on. However, with time, I have realized that weed isn’t actually helping me. Rather, it is simply numbing my problems, and in effect this leaves me unable to deal with them on my own. It got to the point where if I was running out and couldn’t find more, I would wonder how I would function. This all led me to quit smoking 4 days ago. The problem is, I’m experiencing crazy physical/psychological symptoms. I’ve been extremely nauseous and it’s been very hard to eat (I’ve been forcing myself to eat at least a little bit a day). Also, I’m a restaurant manager, which requires me to be on point everyday. Experiencing these symptoms at work has been really difficult and has affected my performance. Some advice from those who have already gone through this would be really helpful and encouraging. Thank you so much to anyone who took the time to read this",9

Then the isolation makes these anxieties grow until even leaving for groceries feels overwhelming.

While watching, I couldn't stop feeling something familiar about all of it, then It hit me, weed was my bedroom, I kept shutting myself inside of it because I felt uncappable of living a better life, yet the constant smoking hindered any will to actually try, it made me contempt with being the worst version of myself.

I'm only 2 weeks sober and It's still hard, but having this realization was very refreshing, and It will be something to remember whenever I crave for weed again.",10
2020-05-17 09:53:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/glfr61/thinking_about_quitting/,Thinking about Quitting,"Hi everyone,

I'm a recovering alcoholic with about 10 months of sobriety under my belt, but I've maintained using marijuana during that time. I've taken it daily, but wouldn't consider it ""heavy"" use. I generally have gone through a 400 mg vape cartridge per week, although lately it's been a bit less. 

Here's the thing - I genuinely don't feel that it's caused much damage in my life. Alcohol caused me a lot of pain, missed work, exaggerated emotions, and hurt my friendships/relationships. That being said, I can't really list out many of the benefits it's given me. I do still enjoy the feeling, it offers a quick hit of pleasure and I think I've been viewing it as a 'reward' in certain respects. 

Recently as I've been working my 12-step program, I've started to realize that maybe I've been using it as a crutch in place of alcohol. It doesn't quite offer the same anti-anxiety effects that alcohol offered for many years (until it turned bad), and a good percentage of the time it increases my anxiety temporarily. 

I've been dating a girl since January who's completely sober from all alcohol, weed, and other drugs - she too is in recovery from alcoholism. I hadn't discussed my weed usage with her until yesterday, as I started to feel really guilty for telling her, plus coupled with the thoughts that were already in my head about potentially quitting....she took it well and said she can't control what I do but she chooses not to. She does not want to be around me if I've smoked and doesn't want it in her house...which is all fair.

I'm just caught up in my own head about whether I need to fully quit. Since yesterday morning, I've only taken a couple quick hits from my vape pen, and that was right before I went to bed last night. I feel scared about quitting and definitely don't want to relapse into alcohol over quitting weed, but at the same time I think I've realized how much of a vice weed is for me. A habit. I rarely smoke enough to get stoned/high now, but the IDEA of quitting fully is really daunting to me. I don't know where to start.

Any help or perspective you all could offer is appreciated. I feel like I wanna crawl out of my own skin today and can't get it off my mind. The feeling that I have right now is I do not want to have any weed today but I feel so uncomfortable and can't get the thought out of my head that I have a problem with it, even at that amount. So naturally, that makes me feel urges to have some. Help!",1

I love weed. I smoke waaay too much, and don't always enjoy it, but I do still love the high most of the time.

Unfortunately, my chest is getting tight and a little sore when I smoke, I feel like it's doing a number on my gums and I'm feeling my heart going too fast, and basically, with the lack of exercise the lockdown is causing me it feels like I'm doing more damage to myself than I'm comfortable with. On the other hand it could purely be psychosomatic and weeds finally started making me paranoid. I think I definitely need to get some more exercise either way. 

I smoke with tobacco (uk), and I feel like quitting that might be the first step.

Where do I even start?,"So I started smoking when I was 16/17 years old. Back in high school, I wouldn’t consider myself a “smoker” because I would only smoke occasionally whenever I went out with my friends. I’m 25 now and for the last 2 years, I’ve gone from smoking only on the weekends to smoke every day of the week. 

My boyfriend and I smoke maybe 2 grams a day. We’ve been saying we want to go on a hiatus for months now but we can’t even go 5 days without smoking. We’ve even got the point where we wake up early each week day and smoke weed. 

I wouldn’t say it’s completely ruining my life but it has caused me to become very very lazy. I use to go to the gym frequently throughout the week but now I can barely workout one day out of the week. This has also caused me to gain a lot of weight (5’4 195 lbs). I feel like a lazy slob. The one good thing that I feel like I have going on is my job but I feel like I am putting myself at risk by smoking weed. I just want to quit but I can’t seem to quit. It also doesn’t help that my boyfriend smokes but I’m not placing blame on him at all. It’s my problem, not his. 

I guess my question is, how do I start this process of quitting? Or at least significantly decreasing how much I consume throughout the week. I just want to get back to feeling like myself and I feel so far from it right now.",1

Excited for the THC to finally be leaving my body.

I also have managed to stop drinking beers. The first week or so after I stopped smoking I seemed to be replacing it with a few bottles each night. Had only a few beers total the last 2 weeks.

I have been socially smoking since the age of 15, turned into daily by the age of 20 when I met my partner who also smoked most his life much heavier than me, and honestly feel like I can't go a day without smoking now.

I'm 25 now and this lock down has really brought everything to a head. I've f**ked my finances up, and tbh most of my life. Weed is still illegal in my country, and a couple of weeks ago we got caught smoking in our flat (ratted out by neighbours - who also smoke by the way they're just nasty people) and luckily got off with a warning and an online course as neither of us ever had an offence before - but to limit costs I took all the blame for it myself, with my partner getting off scot-free.

Since then I have been so paranoid about smoking (inside or outside), almost having an anxiety attack when I see a cop car, but when I think about not smoking the same thing happens. 
My partner still doesn't see it as an issue - I also smoke cigarettes (addictive personality), and to him that's a bigger issue than weed (""cigarette smoke makes him sick""). I tried explaining to him that at the moment the anxiety from smoking indoors makes me sick - and since our outside time is limited maybe we could try to quit at least ""for a little bit"" I even offered to try to quit cigarettes at the same time to make it ""even"". 
He is a very brilliant man, with a decent job, but anyone can see smoking has slowed him down compared to his potential - it has affected our relationship too - I often feel like weed is more important than me, and all we do is sit in two separate spots in the lounge, playing our individual games, watching something for background on the TV,  barely talking, he has also been getting anger issues over time, and I know I have them (PTSD, depression, anxiety and awaiting diagnosis for ADHD) and I'm worried that I turned him into this angry miserable person he seems to be right now, and I also don't want to take away his only coping mechanism from, well, me.
I'm honestly at a point where I wish I could quit, and I have told him that, at least for a few years to get our lives back on track (debts, dropping out of education, lack of socialising), but he does not seem to be at that point (his very successful dad smoked all his life and that's his excuse), and honestly I'm lost. He is the only support network I have at the moment, and it has been a real struggle to say no when he passes me a smoke and everything is crap anyway and I honestly can't see us fixing the future until we both quit. 
I'm just very scared because we are also making it barely through this lock down  (with smoking) and I honestly don't know how I'd handle it with the ""withdrawals"". As I said out neighbours also smoke, and sometimes when I wake up in the morning I can smell the smell right underneath our windows, in our kitchen and bathroom, and it does not make it any easier.

Sorry for the rant but I really didn't know where else to talk about this.

EDIT: I tried speaking to him again, mainly about my anxiety about smoking inside, so he did make the effort to go out for a smoke today - but as soon as it turned dark and cold that went out the window; at which point I did say that it feels like if it was a choice between me and weed he'd choose weed to which he replied I was being ""irrational"" and left the door whilst I went to the bedroom, I'm in bed now but honestly I'm freaking out in case he's smoking and the neighbours call the cops again or just anything happens - even hours after smoking you can still smell it in the room, especially as he refuses to leave any windows open to let it air out as it ""gets too cold"".",20

&#x200B;

I'm a 17 year old senior. I recently started exhibiting weird symptoms linked to my cannabis use, hence after looking online, I found that CHS explained almost EVERY SINGLE symptom/health issues I was recently having. In conclusion, I have to go cold-turkey and quit before I die.

This is my second time attempting to quit, and the last attempt was last year, where I only took a T-Break. This time, it's far more worse. My psychological addiction is through the roof, and after my first day being sober, I can say it's miserable.

I smoked since 2018, and I've upgraded to high-potency dabs after sucking on carts for the last 2 years. My tolerance spiked after that, and eventually it came to this. Last year, it wasn't as hard considering my use was more light, and I wasn't exhibiting any CHS symptoms around then.

I spent half of the day figuring out a way to sum this up to my father, which went pretty well. The only time I felt somewhat-decent was when I went for a jog. Other than that, I've been thrown with anxiety, cravings and a bit of nausea. The best thing helping me at this point is probably my father who's supporting me through this. 

I just wanted to write this considering I do these all the time with T-Breaks, and I'm planning to update it daily. I hope everyone's staying safe during this unusual time!",5

The kicker for me was sexual performance anxiety I suffer from, I got the impression the anxiety symptoms must have something to do with my addiction. I wrote a bunch of reasons and journaled properly, and feel really happy to have reached day 6, even though I’m up late now. Bullet journaling, meditation and regular exercise have proven very useful in the process.

Strange, then, that I broke into tears several times today. Reflecting on how I’ve treated certain people the past years really got to me, I didn’t realise there were people I wronged six years ago that I still feel guilty towards. These situations weren’t directly weed-related, but it makes me realise that weed was addling my ability to be in touch with my emotions. I googled a bit and found steps eight and nine of the twelve-step program directly address this, so I’m happy I came to that conclusion on my own. I’ve begun reaching out to those people, late as it may be, to try to make amends and own up to my mistakes. I also donated to some charities to make sure I’m making a positive impact today.

I'm currently sitting at about 2 weeks since my last inahle and exhale of good ol' bud.

the insomnia I experienced in the first week was fucked. I barely slept all week and since quitting, I've still barely dreamt (was kinda looking forward to the wild dreams but oh well).

I only smoked consistently for about a year and did my best to only smoke at the end of the day.

I see people who smoked way more and way longer than me already having relief at about this stage, but my depression and anxiety just seems to be sky rocketing and my appetite is still shit house.

I'm already naturally thin and I just feel like I'm wasting away. I try to eat as much as I can and as healthy as I can (i'm predominantly plant based, apart from eggs from my mum's lil hobby farm)  but I just feel so nauseous after eating and when I am eating or drinking, it's like cardboard :'( (i'm an hour into trying to finish a bowl of porridge rn as a i type)

last night was the first time feeling suicidal again and it's been about a month since i've thought like that. that was the big reason i stopped. I was literally planning my own suicide and obviously that was a pretty terrifying place to be. 

I'm very self-aware, hence the quitting after only a short while and limiting my intake, but this is just getting tiring and frankly, it's pissing me off.

I've been drinking/smoking since I was 15 very heavily and almost daily. I'm also a farmer so it's always been very close by. 23 now, told myself this would be the year.

I dont know if it is related to weed withdrawals or not, i dont know what to think anymore. I never was a huge weed smoker, i smoked 1 maybe 2 times per week, not more. So i am wondering why i am still feeling like this, i should be fine now but i'm not fine. I am starting to wonder if it is maybe just me, maybe it's my mind being like this, and maybe i am just an anxious guy since i was born, but i don't remember this, i remember before, i was someone else. I dont wan't to be who i was before but i want to be better than i am today. I will not do weed again, even if i suffer, even if i am starting to go crazy because i know it will not help me. So i dont know what is the point of this thread i just want to know if someone else is going through the same thing as me, even if it was in the past. Also , one thing i noticed that is very strange is this anxiety i have, dont even feel like ""common"" anxiety. It's more like being very worried inside about everything, but i can""t really tell "" i am anxious"". I just feel very insecure.

I have been struggling with weed (hashish) overuse/abuse for the last 4 years time. I am 25 years old, and have been trying to stop for the last few months, but now is the day! 

Having tried to stop earlier, I have experienced (and expect to experience again) the following symptoms:

&#x200B;

1. Loneliness/depressive thoughts
2. Hypochondria/ small ""pains"" and discomforts all over my body, periodically. 
3. Lack of appetite
4. Lack of general energy

I imagine most of these are pretty normal for someone in my position, and to that end I REALLY need to thank this group for their posts. Especially the anxiety in regards to my health have driven me back to smoking many times, but  I am confident that Im gonna get through it this time, having realizing just how many people experience the same ""symptoms"" (anyone else gets ""heart pricks / needle sensation in the chest"").

Anxiety disorders run in my family, as my dad and my aunt (his sister) have had pretty moderate issues with it in the past (dad is diagnosed and on medication)

Anyway I started smoking at 17, took a break for almost a year at 18-19 due to being arrested for possession and being put on probation, only for me to go harder than ever before after I had the charge expunged.

Over the last year, during and after my smoking peak, I've noticed myself going through periods of extreme anxiety, being on edge, general sense of doom, fear of others close to me dying, lack of creativity/losing interest in things I enjoyed before (making video games, programming, going out, etc.) etc. etc. that come in intense bursts maybe for a week or two and then disappear, and it's very hard to recreate/describe these emotions after they subside, but I know this isn't normal. When I'm also in this anxious mood I'm very irritable and try my best to keep long conversations, even with my girlfriend and my very, extremely short. My appetite is nothing, and I'll get nauseous after eating even something small. I've also noticed my short term memory getting shittier as well. So far I haven't.

For about a week I had this issue and it finally subsided after I had a night out with my high school friends where we got hammered in one of their apartments (I confess, I had some bud but I had very small hits from a joint and didn't inhale much, if at all. I don't think I got high. Previous to this I hadn't smoked in over a month). Don't know if it was the alcohol of being social but my anxiety has since gone sooo much down since.

Side related info: I see a therapist once a month. My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year now, and she is a bit of a stoner and has her own mental stuff going on.

If I'm going to be honest with you I really can't remember half the anxious feelings I had that I was feeling less than 24 hours ago but I'm going to try my best to put them on a doc I will read to my therapist in a couple weeks.",11

The first few days were hell, with my symptoms getting worse, vomiting like mad day 2, but the past 3 days I've woken up feeling great, even with very minimal sleep- my nausea, pain is gone. I feel normal, and healthy, which I think confirms my suspicions about CHS. I'm posting this in the hope that it can help somebody understand their symptoms if they have CHS.

One thing I've noticed is that I've drastically cut my consumption of beer, without realizing it. Before I was drinking maybe 2-3 a night, and now I might only drink 1 beer or nothing at all, I've probably had 3 total since I quit. I didn't realize how much psychologically smoking weed made me want to drink, but now, I don't autopilot opening beer after beer like I did when I was smoking. I'm probably saving close to $150-$200 a month on beer and weed if I keep it up like this!

My relationship with weed was very mindless. I would wake up and instantly smoke as my first behavior of the day (some people are like this with phones, but I definitely just started my day with weed as the first thing in the morning) and then just smoke all day. Now that I don't just instantly decide to smoke every day I wake up. When I wake up, I'm not thinking ""where is the weed I gotta smoke a bowl"" but ""what am I going to do today""? I had no idea how much I was really autopiloting smoking marijuana, but now that I have to think about my behavior it's becoming very clear.

The conscious effort of not smoking makes me really think more about my behaviors, which is why I'm drinking alcohol less too. Another thing I've realized is the  freetime I have now. Between getting weed, grinding weed, loading weed and actually smoking, never mind actually being high, but the process of smoking is a time sink. I've actually run twice this week which I haven't done in a year (I used to really enjoy running).

The only thing that sucks is insomnia, it would be nice to go to sleep before 7am.",8

Reasoning logically by reminding myself that I don't have an easy source of dopamine or seratonin is only so effective when everything appears in shades of gray. Two months ago my go-to would have been running but I'm still physically recovering from COVID-19. Blessing and a curse, it was the trigger to be sober as it was scary to have to try and stave off withdrawals while fighting this shitty virus. 12 days unable to move, unable to breathe, scared of withdrawals on top of everything. Fun times... Well now I'm on day 42 of my lovely Covid journey and Day 28 of sobriety. I've made it out for two runs, 0.8 mile and 1.3 miles. The issue is that the few days of/after I run seem to be worse on my anxiety. Therapist says I'm likely overdoing it physically and should hold off. Overdoing = more anxiety = tailspin.

At first I was doing this because i really liked smoking weed, but after 4 years (I'm 20 now) i realised that I couldn't stay even a single day without it, and I was only doing it cause I felt a strong need of smoking, not because I found it good or useful.

So in the beginning of March 2020 I was visiting my parents, who live in a small village in the countryside, so when the government imposed lockdown I got stuck there without the possiblity to get some weed.
I thought: ""Well, this is my chance to stay sober for a while"", and I managed to do it for two months, a personal record.

Some days ago I went back to the city where I usually live and I tried to stay away from weed but it didn't end up well, and I smoked for four days straight (at least not as much as I did before).

Now I'm back with my family cause I think right now it's better for me to stay sober, at least until the Covid situations resolves, but I'm still scared of my addiction growing back once this is over, I already got a taste of it and I noticed that I am in fact still addicted and I can't really moderate my smoking, so I will try to keep up this routine of taking some time away and then going back to try and see if I can find a way to control my needs.

Basically the sentence was, “A lot of people characterize addicts as weak people, but actually it takes a lot of mental strength to keep putting yourself though that foggy high over and over again, feeling sick and to still keep getting high.”

Earlier in that chapter the author shared an anecdote about foie gras and the power of marketing; foie gras being force-fed goose liver sold for $$$ as a luxury food item. But that image of a goose in a cage being forced food beyond what it wants or needs, that is what addiction feels like...

But you’re not in a cage. No one is forcing you to pick up the pipe again. Although it may feel like a cage and someone or the universe is forcing you to make that decision, you are in an imaginary cage and you can let yourself out. 

You’re the only one forcing yourself to keep smoking. You have the freedom to choose each time. Cravings make it feel like you MUST smoke but no one is standing over you, forcing you to relapse. It’s all in your mind.

I have been smoking since I was 15. It was something that most of my friends started doing and are still doing since highschool. I've moved around alot too and I would say 90% my friends are always stoners no matter where I end up. I had quit several times especially any time after I would move but always managed to a find a smoker in school or work.  I don't care much for smoking with people, it's something I like to do for myself but it's been a daily habit for too long. I have issues with a medical illness that is benign but bothersome while I sleep and therefore leads to sleep issues and I find myself uncomfortable in my body and with my appetite. So weed has been a great clutch for that but now my needs have grown and I can't just be medically concerned any more.

I have goals. Financially speaking to pay off a couple's things and start moving out. All the moving I have been doing so far was with my family and frankly I've been wanting to leave on my own forever now but I've gotten complacent. my family doesn't care if I smoke or work, they just like having me home but I have to leave the house to smoke everyday multiples times a day and sometimes at night. 

Right now I havent been working since 2020 started except small jobs here and there. Im usually great at budgeting however I would do much better with my goals if I could stop caring about getting high for like atleast a couple months. 

I'm trying to stop spending money on unnecessary things, pay down down debt, save up to move out and get on with my life but I find myself stuck in ground hog day with cannabis. 

I tried quitting last month but I lasted a week before breaking. I cant even seem to have a casual relationship with weed.",2

I started using weed on a regular basis around 2 years ago when I came to a new country to start a master course and it was easy to get at this place.

 Before that I had real bad depression. So during this time if found myself happy for most of my time. I enjoyed studying , doing stuff high and generally more happy. I worked on my mental and physical health and made alot of progress.At one point of time I think I overcame depression. 

Then two months back I moved to a new city for internship and it's really tough to score over here and the quarantine didn't help either. I was missing weed soo much. And the depression came back full force. Working from home was a joke. 

I realised that when I am high, I am really good to myself but now I was calling myself nasty stuff and I think that's why I craved for weed soo much. I didn't enjoy doing stuff anymore.
Only now I am realising that I was addicted to it.I was depending on it to be happy day in and day out. I hope I can be happy again but on my own.

i’ve only just recently joined reddit. i joined because a friend and colleague of mine recommended this page to me. i’ve been reading through the posts that have already been put up here and it’s so empowering to see that i’m not alone in this. to know that so many. others are going through EXACTLY the same thing as i am is not only mind blowing, but it also fills me with so much strength and courage. so thank you for that!!

my normal routine would be that at the end of the day, around 8/9 i’ll roll up a decent sized joint and put a movie on. i’ll barely make it halfway through the film before i decide i can’t force my eyes open any longer; more often than not i’ll end up waking up to the netflix menu! 

in my days i’ve already notice some huge improvements to a few aspects of daily life. even though it’s early days, it’s all looking good. the one major setback i have is, i can’t sleep. it’s 02:30am currently. my body feels tired, my brain feels tired and my eyes feel super tired. but i just can’t seem to switch off my brain. i cant relax enough to even start to drift off. i‘m aware of how weed affects the way we sleep, so i understand why this is happening (which kinda makes it worse).

my question to you guys: do you have any advice for me moving forward? any ways that have helped you get off easier? any help or advice is hugely appreciated, thank you!!",1
2020-05-15 21:29:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gklzgu/my_pandemic_story/,My Pandemic Story,"Hello all, I just joined this group recently after seeing it on the weeds platform and decided to follow. I wanted to just give my story to this platform in case people had relapsed like I had due to the pandemic. Took me a while but here it is, BEWARE ITS KINDA LONG:

First off, I wanna say that cannabis had done a lot of good for me but it had turned into the saying “too much good can be bad.” I had began smoking heavily once college started. I was a very unhappy student, living on a campus I didn’t really like being at but continued to go because I felt there was no way to transfer. The only time I wasn’t miserable was in class or running.

BUT CANNABIS STARTED KILLING MY FUCKING LUNGS.

I was barely able to breathe and I relied on an inhaler when I worked out. Long-distance running was starting to become difficult. To the point of severity where a professor saw me running and mention to me the next day (jokingly of course) “you looked like you were dying!” Fucking I WAS, all because I couldn’t stop smoking because I relied on it too much for my happiness.

Now move forward, it’s October 2019 and I had applied for a really good job. I honestly didn’t think my application would get accepted but IT DID. It was a huge honor for me to get accepted, and when I found out I immediately quit smoking. And I mean QUIT, like I had thrown everything away and focused on prepping for my new job. I really thought things were looking up for me for the year 2020. I got my degree a semester early in December 2019, got nominated for an award for my major’s department, and had a good job waiting for me after graduation...

AND THEN THE FUCKING PANDEMIC HAPPENED. 

I’m like fuck me dude are you serious?! And like a lot of people, my job got put on a hault with no idea on when it would return. IF IT WOULD. I had to move back to my parents home and became really depressed during lockdown. So here I am, back on an inhaler and smoked so much oil within the time of us getting locked down through today. 

I’m really bummed that I relapsed after doing so well, but I think this pandemic has been really eye-opening. I read a really great post on this page a while back about how someone would rather be depressed during the pandemic than be numb from cannabis. Whoever you are, that was such a true statement and that really helped me change my perspective. Thank you to everyone who posts on here, and know that your posts really helped me out. I hope this post can do the same for those who need a reminder that you can quit, even if it takes you a couple tries. Thanks for readin if you made it this far!

(I’m gonna go for a run now and get in shape during this bitch so I come back stronger than ever! Cheers to quitting, round 2😂)",4

It will take time to recover properly if you're committing to stay sober and deal with life through healthier ways. But eventually, you'll be a better version of yourself way before you decide to constantly cave in and search for a quick fix or solution. Weed being a quick fix is something non existent. You're only shifting your issues, not solving them.

What did the so called quick fix bring us? We're all in the same boat considering we usually all deeply relate to so many posts from each other. Weed used to be fun, but in the long run it only made matters worse. Usually only noticing what it had done to us after a few years.

If you're really struggling, find a therapist! I recently got in touch with a therapist through a rehab. It's mainly counseling for my self confidence. One thing that has already helped me pretty much right away was keeping a positivity journal. For those that are more likely to think negative about themselves, keeping a positivity journal is really worth trying. Just write everything you've done yourself that you consider to be good or positive for each day. Keep this up as it will reprogram your thinking and improve your mood!",3

In hindsight, should have tapered with the coffee, as the withdrawals from both are kicking my ass right now. 

I got past the vomit-inducing migraine earlier this week, but the after math of that has left me feeling fatigued, spacey like an airhead, ""hungry"" but no appetite, getting sweats/chills, a bit delirious and shaky likely from lack of water and food, no motivation for self care or for my work, and pretty anxious. I've even been waking up anxious which is new, and no fun at all. 

I heard about BRAT - Bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, but even those are hard to eat. 

I smoked two hits earlier today to hopefully regain some appetite and it helped a bit, but not much. 

Any advise is welcome. I'm so thankful it's Friday and I can take the next day or two to myself and hopefully feel more myself before my meeting with our CEO next Monday morning 😩",2

It really helped with the anger issues and agressive self destructive behavior I used to have, it helped me loosen up, be confident, find friends. Until last year I realised that since I turned 18 I hadn't gone more than about 4 month in total without weed. So I tried to stop for longer. And stopped functioning. I realised how slow I had become, that I was behind on so many things, that I could have turned all those ideas into music, that without marihuana I would have been able to keep track in Luther school, that I wouldn't have felt like I had to drop out because I just couldn't keep up, etc. So I drowned myself in smoke again. Stopped, again, delt with the trauma, overcame a big part of depression. Started again, because why not? ""I can have a healthy relationship with marihuana, I know now that I can cope without it, I'm young, why deprive myself of innocent fun?""
HA, joke's on me. 

It wasn't until January 2020 that I finally understood that I can't keep going on like this. That I admitted to myself that I'm addicted. That starting projects and then dropping and forgetting about them as soon as I ""just wanna smoke for a while"" is not healthy and that I was really only excellent at making excuses. 

I can either smoke my life away and stay a lazy, never really content but too half brained to care potato, or never touch any drug again. (Stopped drinking two years ago, taking psychedelics last year and smoking cigarettes along with smoking joints)",2

Smoking makes me feel tired and gross. But when I'm sober, it feels like I have a great big hole inside my chest that needs to be filled. 

I'm scared of that restless, uneasy feeling. I know I need it in order to move forward with my life but it's so much easier to stay still and comfortable

Does anyone have any advice on getting the motivation to quit? I think I'm having trouble imagining the other side where I can enjoy living and being sober.

Most of my friends are stoners who subscribe to the idea that weed is a “one size fits all” plant and that it’s impossible for it to negatively effect one’s life. I started lurking in this group a few months ago, and it made me feel so validated in my decision to stop smoking. I smoked heavily all through my late teens/early 20’s, and every time I ran out of weed, I would feel the emotions I was neglecting bubble up to the surface and it would terrify me into buying more and sinking back into a constant daze. I did poorly in school, skipped most of my classes, and neglected taking care of myself. I went to the dentist recently, and all those times I didn’t brush my teeth because I was too stoned added up to a costly bill because of gingivitis. I barely remember the last few years because I was so stoned for most of the memories I made. I remember wondering if I had a problem when I would try to take a tolerance break and would get intense cravings and anxiety until I bought more. I talked to some friends about it, and no one seemed to take it seriously, and even though they weren’t rude about it in any way, I felt so alone. 
I took a long break from smoking for the past few months, and the last time I broke that streak was on 420. The weed just gave me anxiety, and I wasn’t able to enjoy myself. Reading y’all’s posts on this forum has helped me take my life back- now that I don’t smoke anymore, I’ve gotten back into working out, taking care of myself, and I feel like I have more time in the day. Sometimes I get the “itch,” but then I remember how anxious I get after I smoke, and that’s enough to deter me away. I’ve been taking long walks every day, but when I was high all the time my social anxiety made it too scary to go outside. It’s so nice to be sober- even though it sucks sometimes, dealing with my emotions in a healthier way has reaped so many benefits. 
One of my close friends is a stoner who spends all his money on weed, gets angry easily (especially when he runs out), and his personality has changed so much. Now that I don’t smoke with him, I see it even more, and it sucks. It feels like our friendship was based solely on weed. I do get a little scared of my stoner friends thinking I’m “holier than thou” when the quarantine is over and I decline their offers to smoke, but I know the fear is probably not based on any real merit, and most of my friends will be fine with it. 
I guess I’ve been rambling long enough- I hope you all are having an amazing day, and thank you for all having the bravery to do what’s best for yourselves and for sharing your stories!",3

I fantasized about having a healthy relationship with it where I can take it or leave it, like have a bit tucked away and just pull it out “once in a blue moon’. But I know now that’s not possible for me.

Last night, Artemis decided that she would take the whole bed, leaving me curled up / fighting to take it back.

Man, I love my puppers. I always wake up to a happy egon saundering up the bed, and licking me, as soon as he sees I'm awake. On the other hand, Artemis will wake me up by licking me, and tell me its time to take her out. I guess, if your a dog owner, you wont get it, but its great. 

They have kept me alive, and gave me a sense of responsibility I never elsewise would have. I quit in part, to make sure i could care for them better, because they deserve the best care and attention possible. They give it to me.

I realised today, that I really really look forward to the group in the morning. It keeps me going, gives a postitive and great start to my day, and i dont think i would have made it this far without it. I almost wish there was an evening group, instead of an afternoon one, but at the same time, worry it will lose its magic if its 24/7... the same people will come on at different times, and... i just... i feel it would be a great loss to us who use it to help build a routine, after leaving. 

Of course, timezones suck, so i understand why people want other hours, but, would (selfishly) hate to lose the regulars to those hours.

Back to chopping wood. The logs at the bottom are bigger, and i had to stop for a few days, so its harder, but its great! Tried doing it with my 40lb vest on, had to stop after 3 and take it off.

My dad has been in prison my whole life and my mom is/was a major alcoholic/drug addict and would be violent with me. My mom had her drug dealer boyfriend move in with us for a while. Weed was my outlet to escape my chaotic home life. I never had that normal high school experience...was always bailing my mom out of jail and working two jobs.  

Anyways, I somehow got a college degree and a tech job with a big city salary but I still find myself depressed and a little anti social.

I started college Jan 7 2013, and started being a daily smoker to sleep in the fall. Since then I’ve grown in tolerance where I smoke about an oz a week. A WEEK. That hurts the wallet but most importantly it’s hurting my family. 

I didn’t do anything for my wife for Mother’s Day. I hate holidays as it is because of marketing, but that day I made sure to let my wife know that she comes after my habit. 

Only thing she really asked for was Mexican food from her favorite place the next city over. My habit with weed made me take about 3 hrs to bring the burritos back because I decided to stop by the shop to pick up a couple of 1/8s and a pod. I spent about $140 and I smoked it all in 3 days. 

That day I not only spent a lot more money on my weed habit than the mother of my children. I didn’t even have enough cash, and didn’t want to make another stop to get her flowers from the freeway people. 

I’ve lost control. And I need to regain it back. My wife is unhappy every time I go smoke and hears me coughing. I go out about every other hr or hr to top off. 

I need out. 

My family deserves me out of a consistent daze. 

I hope I’m strong enough for them but more importantly, for me.",8

This  post is about quitting weed and the miracle of the menstrual cycle.  Some background information: I've used hormonal contraception up until  last July, and I just recently got into Fertility Awareness Methods for cycle tracking (not relevant for my actual question). I noticed two things: 1)  my cycles are quite long (average of 37 days), and 2) my ovulation  seemed to be very very late in the cycle. I wondered what could cause that, since the last sign not the best one in terms of fertility, and when I  googled around a bit, I soon saw ""marijuana"" as a cause of late ovulation and a short luteal phase (the phase from ovulation to the start of your period).

It may be  good to know at this point that I've been using weed for about 4-5  years, and vaping daily for over two years. Before, I vaped alternately 2  to 5 times a day, then I quit for a while, my goal was to start again  but only vape once in a while. Well, that crawled up again, and up until  recently 1-2 times a day.

I  searched for research articles that could confirm this claim I found  online or tell me anything more about the influence of THC on the cycle.  Until now I've come across some studies that have been done on either a  small group of women, or monkeys.

From these studies (I'm not allowed to post links here, so google for yourself),  it seems that THC can lower estrogen and progesterone and thereby can lenghten your cycle and block or delay ovulation, though all  studies have their own flaws and more study should be done. For this  reason, I'm interested in others' experiences, and that's why I turned  to this subreddit :-).

**Has  anyone had any similar experiences? Irregularities in mentrual cycle  after quitting weed? Or after starting weed? I'm curious about any  changes that resemble my experience or otherwise. OR: anyone with more  knowledge on the topic?**

*TL;DR I suspect THC influences my cycle negatively, but science lacks strong backup, curious about others' experiences!*",9

2020-05-15 08:46:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gk8gps/why/,Why,"I started smoking junior year after a real bad breakup 3 years ago. This is how I finally decided to stop.

My partner of almost 4 years up and left our apartment with the dog we adopted 6 months prior while I was on thanksgiving vacation with my family, leaving an awful note about how I was emotionally abusive and gaslighting her (reality: I was an idiot and had no idea the effects my words and actions could have on someone wracked by severe unknown and undiagbnosed
 anxiety). We had been struggling for some time, but what really hit home was losing my dog. He was literally my best friend, and when he was gone I had no idea what to do. I cried every night for a week, couldn’t make it to class, couldn’t get work done. Even my stimulants couldn’t help me out of my funk.

One night, my neighbor heard one night and invited me over for a bowl or two, and that was that - I had discovered cannabis, and I LOVED it. I’m sure you know the story from there. It’s been a wild ride ever since, and my brain feels like it has changed so much that I don’t even recognize myself anymore.

Fast forward three years and I’m still at that that dead end job I took because I had an in from an internship instead of looking for something better that makes me happier. I’m still pushing paper and reviewing reports instead of improving processes and learning every day like I know I can. I absolutely hate what I am doing, and for way too damn long I have just accepted that as life.

Up until a month ago, I was also still smoking daily - something like a gram of concentrate a week, sometimes two if i was having a bad week. I’ve tried to quit a dozen times, and each time there’s SOMETHING that brings me back - stress, boredom, depression, frustration, loneliness... you know the drill.

I still think about it every day and have to resist the urge to order or pick up another gram. Some days it’s so bad I give up on work, eating, sleeping, doing anything because what’s the purpose of a life that doesn’t feel good?

I’ve asked myself more questions than I can count since I decided I wanted to quit in January, but the most important one I’ve found is the one someone else had to ask me first:

“Why do I want to quit?”

Exercise time: Answer this as completely as you can, and then ask yourself “why” to all of your answers until you can’t ask why any more. See where it takes you, it might surprise you.

I did my own “why-why” tree last month, and I realized my real issue is not with cannabis, but with my life in general. Cannabis is just a really terribly maladaptive coping mechanism I’ve adopted for boredom and a lack of clarity and focus on my own future and well-being. My issue is how I use it, not the substance itself.

I came to the conclusion that I needed a real goal, something to make life about more than getting high, masterbation BF and all I excelled in school before and during college because I had a GOAL: become an engineer and make myself and my family proud. Get a job. Make money. Network. 

I did that... Now what?

Deciding that I want to go back to school for my master’s to make something real of my career is what finally did it for me. I gave myself a real goal, validated it with the people I trust and love, and ran with it. Now I’m a month clean and going strong, more than two weeks longer than my best previous record. 

As hard as it is to keep this up, I don’t want to stop - I finally have something more important to achieve than getting high. THAT is the key difference between now and the last time. 

When I finally get there, I’ll set another goal and make it happen. Rinse and repeat.

Tl;dr: Understand why you want to stop. Don’t stop there, KEEP asking yourself until you have nothing left to ask. Then solve the problem you’re presented with.",2

I just want to be done with weed for a long long time. I’ll be completely honest & say that I know weed will be a part of my life in the future - at least that’s where my mind is right now, but I want to take a very long - at LEAST a year - break to get my fucking head together

I’ve been smoking weed since I was like 14. I’m 18 now, turning 19 in August. Last year in October I quit for a full month. I was doing so so good man damn it makes me hurt just thinking about it. Then I got into a car accident - that same day I sparked up with my brother - leading me into the rabbit hole. It’s been 6 months now & I feel pretty shitty. 

I can’t eat. I physically cannot eat. My stomach growls & growls at me & I can’t do anything ;(. I have no appetite, but I get these extremely vicious, nauseous hunger pangs - they last maybe 5 minutes, multiple times a day. It’s gotten to a point where I don’t even have the munchies anymore !! 

I don’t know what this is. I had a “spiritual awakening” last year so I’m also going through that. I’ve noticed that I’m way way more repulsed by fast foods - and meats In general. I think subconsciously I know how shitty all the foods I eat are & it makes me so so sick. I can’t afford raw vegan stuff right now though , so I just don’t eat. It makes me so sad because I love food, but my mind won’t even let me chew. Last night I got chic fil a & basically wasted my money bc I didn’t finish - this was after I had smoked too !! I’m like 125 - the most I’ve weighed is maybe 145. Never had problems with my weight. I’ve always been pretty dainty & petite and or average. Like I said I love food !!! I just can’t hold down more than 2 chicken tenders at a time. It makes me so sad ;(

I vowed to make today my official Day 1. I’ve been trying to have a day 1 these entire last 6 months. I truly have been suffering, mentally & physically. I’m always tired, no motivation. At work im a fucking zombie. Can’t push myself to meditate, can’t eat, my ears are ringing so damn loud. I also think I met my spirit guide last week when I was high. Weed definitely raises my vibration - & a voice in my head literally freaking said “nice to meet you” then my ears went crazy ringing & I could feel & low key see like energy or something in both corners of my eyes - looking at my ceiling (can someone tell me if I’m tripping or did it really happen). 

Anyway I know this was long I’m sorry but I have no friends to vent to, literally not a single one. Wishing does no good, but I wish I could just live out loud & be free. I wish I didn’t depend on weed & would stop feeding my ego. I wish myself the best I really do. I don’t even want to go to work. I don’t want to be hungry & nauseous & tired & feeling suppressed. Anyway if you made it this far, thx so much. Hope I come out of this stronger. I truly truly want to stop smoking. I’ve been saying that all this time - never any true action behind it. Where I’m at now, I literally can’t do it anymore. Feels like my head is about to burst. I’m so so tired. I can’t even cry, I don’t even know what emotion I’m feeling. I don’t even feel anything right now. I just want it to be over.",2

I already got the job I wanted and I'd like to believe smoking would just be something I did every once and awhile.

But I get this huge sense of shame and panic when I even think about this. It feels like I would be a huge failure. And on top of that, the company that I'm working for never drug tested me (which they always do apparently) so I'm scared they are going to spring one on me out of nowhere since they havent done it. It's only saliva so I figure that if I smoke once and then stop I'll be good within a few days.

It's been about a week since my trip to the clinic for the test and I am spiraling down fast. I know my world as I know it is over and I feel overwhelmed and stressed out and depressed and anxious beyond belief.

Today is going to be day 1 of not having a pinch full to smoke before going to sleep. I've been on the verge of quitting for a while now but couldn't move forward because of my codependent relationship with weed. This recent event had made me to stop weed altogether. It is forced upon me and I am on this path of quitting cold turkey. 

It may sound like I'm not a willing participant in quitting weed, it may seem like I'm a reluctant quitter, but I know I am done with it. When you know you're over something, or when you know that a relationship had turned sour and you no longer see the point of being in a relationship, you just up and quit. Cigarettes were the same for me. I quit cold turkey after years of smoking about a pack a day. I know they're not the same especially with withdrawal symptoms, but I will endure the obstacles along the way so I can finally stop my dependency with this plant. It's been a nonstop craving for 5 straight years and I am getting exhausted. Not realizing my fullest potential during my late 20s and into my 30s was my biggest regret being with this plant. I may have accomplished things along the way, but I know there is more to this life than just the plant I smoke to feel a bit better. I am ending a relationship with weed once and for all. Here's to a new life, a new chapter.

If you have any tips, advice, stories to tell, books to read, short stories to read, podcast to listen to, and anything in between that will help me during this trying times of seperating from weed, please feel free to share it here. It will not only help me but others too. Reading through this subreddit is helping me a lot. Love this subreddit and to all who are ""leaving"".",1

After talking about all the ways it makes my life and my anxiety worse with my therapist I finally decided to give it up several months ago. I’m so glad I did it then because if I was just trying to give up as Covid was hitting, that initial anxiety from quitting would have compounded with the fears and stress from everything else going on. And I would’ve been overjoyed to see that the marijuana shops were still open. I know that my overall anxiety would be so much worse on a day by day basis if I was still smoking, and I would have rationalized smoking every single day during quarantine, probably even during work hours.

So grateful to be free of addiction during this time. It’s still hard, especially when I see people doing it on tv or my anxiety gets really bad, but I’ve come so far past that point of feeling like I have no control to stop myself.",8

Addiction, in any form, is me telling myself I need to escape, that I can't handle what's happening in my own life. That is incredibly powerful in reinforcing an idea that I am too weak to handle any of life's difficulties. The drug feeds this lie.  How demoralizing.  No wonder my self esteem is low.  The drug became the master and I was the puppet.  No more, I'm done with that crap.

Time to break the cycle now.  I am capable, I can handle it, and I'm going to.

Life is short. I realize now I just don't have time for that lifestyle anymore, too much life wasted already.

I've seen it many times on here from successful leavers- quitting is just the start.  Making it permanent depends on working on yourself, finding out what's really going on in your head and your heart, and addressing it.",23

The first year and a half of use didn’t seem to affect me all that greatly but also, I didn’t smoke very often and if I did it was in social occasions. About half way through my marijuana experience I started to smoke more frequently. People around me started to think I was dumb, but I would shrug it off because in my own complex, I liked being the simple, dumb, funny guy, and relied on my self belief that it was just because of my, in a sense “act”. Although I may have seemed to be subpar smarts wise, I actually had quite the vocabulary, and had pertain-able knowledge as well as always being able to be sociable and funny off-the-cuff. 

In this past year I’ve been smoking frequently and have come to realize how much of an anchor marijuana has become to me. I noticed a decline in grades and feel overall I had been smarter and wiser beforehand. Whether if I I’m high or not I feel as if I am a shell of myself that is struggling to stay the same character or any character for that matter. Even holding a conversation can be hard for me. I find myself recycling through the same responses that do nothing for the conversation or either of us. I also find myself drawing blanks when I try to respond to people.

The problem is I had so much motivation to quit initially, the first few days/ first week I was feeling so many benefits from quitting (mentally, emotionally, physically). I’ve had bad gut/digestion problems for all the years that I’ve been smoking and things were finally changing for the better. 

A few days ago I was with a friend who offered me a joint (not knowing the personal struggle I’m going through) I hesitantly accepted. Which got me thinking maybe I can smoke here and there without any issues. I’m about to be home alone for a few days and the thought popped into my head that maybe I should go buy a few joints to pass the time. Before this happened I was so strongly set on not ever smoking again. But now the thoughts are creeping back into my mind saying “how bad can it be?”. I’m scared I’ll fall back into being stoned everyday very easily. I have very little self control. It feels like initially I was in a sort of unrealistic phase of feeling all the benefits of quitting and being so happy about it, more aware, memory improving, less isolation from my family. But now I’m starting to feel the anxiety and stress I used to smoke weed to mask. I just feel like I’m not strong enough to stay sober and also questioning the point of staying sober.

From what I can see, a lot of you began smoking to hide from a pain or a struggle and feel that's still lurking even now, such as feeling depressed while sober. Look my family isn't perfect, my parents would argue quite frequently, resulting in myself getting involved or heading to the back of the house to smoke weed and a cigarette. But I never really noticed that they haven't argued like that for over a year now, there was no stress to relieve. In my mind over the past year, I literally told myself I couldn't have fun if some sort of intoxication wasn't in me. Feel like playing a video game? It'll be funner with weed. Got some oven food to eat? Funner with weed. Going to work? Funner with weed.

 Those arguments between my parents could of been handled without weed too, after all my parents are still together and we have a nice house. I've always thought I needed some sort of struggle to become successful. These stories of billionaires rising from the bottom. I think in the end I created it without realizing. I think I quite literally aimlessly smoked weed just to make reality more entertaining, which as I found out in the end, does not make reality more entertaining. Here I am again wishing I had a better reason for being a lazy fuck. Also I should add I feel great after quitting, my depression was far worse when on it.

I guess my point is, I've come to the realization fully, despite hearing Gary Vee speak on this a load of times, that you dont need to come from the bottom to be somebody. Even in the higher class, you're as good as a nobody if you're not doing anything to build your legacy. I wasted some good teen years trying to create a struggle for myself, when now I'm back to ground zero. At least now being sober, I can go from zero to one.",11

2020-05-14 16:36:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gjui4d/one_day_shy_of_ten_weeks_used_to_be_unthinkable/,One day shy of ten weeks– used to be unthinkable,"Until the beginning of March, I had been a heavy, daily smoker for \~6 years and a habitual smoker for a few years before that. After work every day; all day on weekends; all day on most weekdays when I was in school. Any day I didn't wake and bake all I could think about was when I would be high. I would put off going to see friends until I could pick up. I planned my schedule singularly around when my dealer could come through. I learned his habits and how to arbitrage them against my schedule. 

Parts of my struggle probably sound similar to lots of yours. I was the ""weed friend,""  at parties and hang outs. The physical act of smoking and the retreat from groups felt like a desperate refuge from my social anxiety. Being high allowed me to feel ""on"" when I was talking to people. I got to the point so many of us got to; I realized that smoking/vaping/edible taking was a convenient way to ""press a button"" diminishing the negative emotions I felt, the lack of confidence I felt, the deadened feeling and anhedonia on those days, the racing thoughts and chaotic mind swirl on those days. I started to feel the buildup underneath the numbness of feelings un-coped with, always there, wishing they weren't, that I weren't. I want to begin to process them, even though what 'processing' means to me is still opaque and wrapped up on the paralyzing perfectionism that I started smoking to escape in the first place. How do you let your feelings happen without scoring yourself on how successfully you've felt?

Most of my friends know me to have a gregarious personality. In these past several weeks I've not had the energy to maintain that enthusiasm. I worry that I'm I'll be a tax on their already limited amount of energy. We're going through a global pandemic, everyone is struggling. I don't want to give the people in my life more to fret over. The ones whom I've started to tell I have quit (not trying, doing) meet me with anything ranging from neutrality to bemused pointlessness ; ""how long are you abstaining for'""; ""now seems like exactly the time to get high, etc."" I don't think they understand how high I've made the stakes for myself and part of me resents them for it. Most people don't view weed as something that can facilitate an addiction, particularly as the national (American) conversation on it becomes more accepting as weed becomes more ubiquitous. Since quitting, even more than before, I am aware of how ingrained in so many of our lives substance use as a way of emotional regulation and escape is normalized and even culturally encouraged. That scares me.

My memory has been in shambles. My thought stream has felt like a car engine whose starter is busted: constantly turning over, finding no traction. It has been really difficult to put sentences together, to talk to people; I feel like every one else is moving at normal speed and when I open my mouth to answer someone I get a rapid cascade of blanks. Talking and thinking at the same time is challenging, but after stopping to collect my thoughts, when I open my mouth vocalize them it's like the thinking never happened. It's impossible for me to tell, and a near constant source of anxiety, whether or not this is due to the abuse of weed, or a more intrinsic failing (I know its not, but tell that to what I know...). For my passion, which is writing, and my job, this corrosion of memory has been terrifying, and I'm doing everything I can not to allow the addict's fallacy voice in my head to claim this among the arsenal of reasons to cave.

I don't want to leave you with the impression everything is bad. I feel more ""real"" than I have in years. I feel better in my body. I can breathe like I haven't breathed since I was a teenager. Nothing is sweeter than a full, deep breath. It gets deeper every day. While my mood has been swinging around the negative end of my emotional spectrum, I'm able to comprehend the things that spark those feelings, being more honest with myself about what that is, especially when its an ugly one. The degree this improves my connection to my me-ness is unspeakably large, even if its not pleasant, necessarily. I look forward to that day I will have an authentic self-generated happiness I can connect to as fully.

I've been trying to quit for almost a year now, with some periods of sobriety and a lot of relapses. Sobriety cycles are getting longer though, which is cool.
Lately I've been thinking about how my environment affects my quitting efforts. I live in a 12 square meters room, there's a kitchen in another floor. Recently the building started being infected with little roaches, which you can see everywhere and I have a lot of those in my room. Money is better now but I used to live with 500€ a month which is not a lot in France. Plus there's a dealing spot 5 min away from where I live. And I just feel like I smell hash every time I walk the streets (or the corridors here sometimes). When I think of all those things combined i get a little more forgiving to myself, but then I just end up smoking again 

I feel like when I get a job (I'm really close to finishing university) and finally move out to a better place (which is reeeeeeaaaaaally hard here without a work contract or parents that can guarantee the owner) it will be 10x easier to quit.

I thought I would post an update as I havent in quite some time. I used to post here frequently in the early months of my recovery. 

I'm a 38 year old healthy male. I have no history of mental illness. 

I'm coming up on 15 months and in many ways things have returned to normal, more normal than they ever have been. But I still get waves of PAWS, which is frustrating and at times disheartening. 

There is so much I could post, and maybe one day when this is well and far behind me I will write a book or at least a very thorough post on my experience. PAWS is real, it is traumatic, and at times you feel so alone because no one can relate to you and no one even believes you. Well I f\*cking do!!

There is scarcely any scientific literature on PAWS in cannabis users, and most therapists are clueless on the subject. That's not to say they cant *help* you, it's just that this isnt a very defined and well-studied condition like depression.  

The first few months were very, very difficult for me. I had about a month of physical symptoms: 'adrenal dump' things like sweating, shaking, diarrhea, incessant runny nose, nausea, etc; and deep, pervasive anxiety and panic. I was barely functional. I would have bad days and VERY bad days, with a few good moments or hours here and there. I tried antidepressants briefly and that was a disaster with my damaged brain.

The next few months were better with most of my physical symptoms having disappeared. I still struggled massively with anxiety and these very unwanted depressive spells unlike anything I had ever experienced. The best way I could describe it would be ""existential depression"", or despair. I had recurring suicidal thoughts---not desires---but thoughts and fears about it. They would come and go like rainstorms. There were many times I feared I was permanently cracked. 

Months 6-12 had more good than bad, but I was also discovering that I was extremely sensitive to stimuli and stressful events. Things would be going along just fine, and then I would have an athletic competition or a stressful event like travel, and that would set off 2 weeks of PAWS. I discovered I couldnt drink, even 1-2 drinks, or I would get depressed the next day. I had to be very careful with other addictive things like porn, too much caffeine, even social media! During that time I was also going through some hormonal treatments for fertility, and man oh man was that miserable. I think it would have sucked for anyone, but my fragile brain chemistry could not handle it. 

At 1 year I was feeling better than I ever had, and for the most part had regained my 'normal' mind. The only things that would set me off were traveling (which has gotten better every time), and athletic competitions. I would get super hyped and anxious up until the day of the tourney, then CRASH hard emotionally for 1-2 weeks after. Depression, sadness, anhedonia. 

The last 3 months have been an improvement still, to the point I thought I was free and clear!! But alas, COVID, marital stresses, some job insecurity, and now a new baby on the way have stirred the pot again on PAWS.  So I'm working through another wave now. 

I hesitated to even post this because I dont want to discourage anyone. I didnt want someone to read this and think ""this guy has been sober for 15 months and he still has PAWS symptoms!!"" But I have faith that I will recover 100%. By that I mean I will no longer have these exaggerated emotional/mental swings to life stressors. That doesnt mean I wont *feel* anything!!! I used weed for so long that I forgot what it what it was like to feel and process normal positive and negative feelings. And the biggest encouraging indicator is how I have gradually gotten better the entire time (but not necessarily in a linear fashion). 

Every case is different, and I have some theories as to why mine was so bad: 1) I used weed for a LONG time; 12 years cumulatively, with the last 6 years being daily high-potency use. 2) I have a sensitive brain to anything mind-altering, and I've known this for a long time. It took me very little to get high, I've never tolerated alcohol well, and even Rx meds dont go over well with me. 3). I had a traumatic end to my smoking career. I didnt quit because I thought I should ""clean up"" my life; I quit because I started having intense, protracted panic attacks with normal amounts of weed! I had to, there was no other choice. Weed became a poison and it felt like quit, or perish. 

The majority of you wont take this long to recover. But for those who do, take heart. We WILL get our normal minds back. But you have to give it a fighting chance! Stop ALL other addictions in your life (except for perhaps a bit of coffee), find a therapist you can trust, exercise daily, eat a decent healthy diet, trust the process and talk to God! He cares for you, deeply. 

I am available if anyone wants to talk always.

I'm feeling more confident mentally now that my symptoms are almost identical to all of you guys. And here I thought I was going to have to go to a testing clinic for covid lmao. But maybe thats just bad brain talking. My symptoms are night sweats, anxiety, lack of appetite, weight loss, shortness of breath (especially since I've eaten nothing and trying to exercise), etc. I'm still physically feeling like shit after going cold turkey and threw my cart away on the first day but everyone keeps saying that this will be much much better than gradually reducing my intake over time. Especially since I also take meds for my depression and stuff. I was at a super low point in my life on day one and basically, I called the national suicide hotline and I explained my situation (quitting weed and the constant anxiety and feeling shitty abt myself etc.). I'm not saying smoking zero weed has made me almost want to end it all, but man putting uo with every little nuisance in the day can get difficult at times.

I'm just at a crossroads rn. I want to call this number that they gave me. It looks like a nearby clinic but this stupid withdrawal anxiety alongside the clinical depression and little energy make it super difficult to eat, get out of bed, exercise, etc. I really want it all to go away (sounds like a similar feeling, I think? Like getting high?) but frankly I feel like the best way to approach things after being on this sub till 4am and waking up 5hrs later due to lack of sleep is to head straight into it. 

tbh I wanna keep my head held high I really do. It's just so difficult with everything going on",1

Long story short I was smoking from 12 till 22, without a days break since the day I started smoking. I am really happy I am here now. But honestly I cannot get the thought of the weed hitting the back of my throat. That feeling, I am sure you all know what I am talking about. The urge to cough, the feeling in the lungs, for me that is the bit I miss the most. Because as much as I vape (nicotine), I cannot get that hit to the back of my throat.... but I guess that is just getting over an addiction right...?

I do not know if I will ever get rid of that feeling, the want for the back of the throat, but I guess that is one of the challenges. 

Also I cannot sleep, like I did not sleep the night before last, last night I got two hours... I am sure it will get back to normal at some point, but at the moment it is lowkey torture.. lying there trying to sleep, I know you know what I mean

I want to quit so badly.  It's ruining my marriage, getting in the way of work...

Before he didn't understand why I want to quit marijuana so much, because he thought I only smoked at night and on the weekend, which isn't a problem. Now he knows it's a full-blown dependence, so I'm getting the support I need rather than continuing to lie and hide it.

During that time developed a passion carpentry.

Well this last month has pushed me over the edge and I finally see it as clearly as the people around me who aren't in a hazy cloud of confusion like my friends and I. 

Since the quarantine the police have new stop and search powers and decided to use them on me while I was walking my dog, they found about 2gs of hash, which I am expecting a court summons for because Ireland is scuffed and will probably be fined 300 Euro. 

Local supplies running low and quality not where I want it I decide to use dark net, ordered and waited two weeks of going to sleep at 4 or 5 am and waking up at 9 craving weed waiting for the postman, package finally arrived and its been seized by customs. 

At the moment I'm not sure of what kind of legal trouble im in. But whatever it is in not ready, I'm not ready for anything really because I've dumbed myself down from years of smoking my brain to mash potatoes. 

Im 19, almost 20. Been a heavy smoker since I was 14 pretty sure I've haven't gone more than 2 weeks without weed since I started. Its become more trouble than its worth, 

I wanted to quit for my health, psychical but mostly mental, for all the money I spend, all the time wasted, bridges burnt but I could never a totally quit. It is getting caught twice in one month to realise what the fuck am I doing, if it was anything other than weed I would have quit.

I feel like maybe this is my new normal. That these things always pissed me off but before I quit I was just always too high to care enough to say anything. But now I'm sober I'm just constantly getting annoyed, and then pointing it out, and I can only use ""I quit weed give me a break"" for so long before I'm perceived as just an arsehole.

I don't want this to be my new normal though. Stoner me was chill, laid back, didn't give a shit and would just brush off any and everything that I found annoying/insulting/etc. Is this the new normal or can I expect it to start wearing off eventually?

I should add I smoked weed with tobacco and quit tobacco cold turkey on the same day, so maybe it's the lack of tobacco that's causing it. I don't know. I just want it to stop before all my friends start to think I'm just a cunt and abandon me.",7

This is my pledge.,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I(M35) am finally going to quit. It’s been a long time coming and reading the different posts over a number of years has motivated me to try again. I have quit before for a few months here and there, but always viewed it as something I want to go back to, you know, moderation.

I started smoking pot when I was in high school, here and there, and I enjoyed it. I wouldn’t turn it down if I was offered some. Pot became my drug of choice, but I would drink too. I don’t drink heavy now, might have a drink a week or 2.

I have 2 degrees and have a good job. I’ve been with the same wonderful women since 2004, I was barley 19, she was 17. We have 2 kids and we’re very happy. I’m not happy with my choice to smoke pot, and it’s something that causes tension in our relationship. I’m also concerned with my memory and that I’m completely missing out on life.

I have anxiety and depression, both diagnosed by doctors. I’m not on any medication, and I haven’t talked to my councillor in 8 months or so. I’m feeling really good about myself right now but I don’t have any other coping strategies other than using. When I pressured my wife a bit into getting a medical card, thinking I was capable of self medicating, she agreed. We’ve argued about it, but we love each other very much and have a strong relationship. She supports me. I always feel like I’m not meeting her expectations, but that’s probably my anxiety. I am told I am a good husband and a good father and I believe it and am proud of myself.

I’ve been telling myself for years to learn something or be creative, or get a hobby, to deal with cravings and to distract myself. When I do things, I want to be high. I’ve been getting high nearly every day for the better part of 4 years, and enough is enough. I’m really ready this time.

My commute to work is about 1 hour both ways, so I’m gone the majority of the day. Being home because of Covid has really put things into perspective for me and I’m throwing out everything after I post this. I’m making a promise to myself, no grand gesture, and I will be proud of everyday I continue to see what’s important to me. I will hold myself accountable by being honest and vulnerable. I will fight through cravings knowing I have support and that my life will be better. You’ve got this!

I don’t know if that makes any sense but this a very new, albeit strange, experience for me.

It also made me realise that in the past, I haven’t been able to remember most of my dreams (except some recurring nightmares I’ve been having for several years). And more often than not I think I’ve had completely dream-less nights.

I do enjoy having a clear head and not mumbling my words or sentences. I DO find it difficult to remain interested in a subject or person though.

Yeah, I agree "" type of replies. Now that I'm sober, I noticed I been asking more follow up questions to what the person was talking about. 


I miss my old self before I smoked but thankfully High Me gave me a greater sense of empathy and to really reflect back on my life. I feel as if I'm more compassionate and logically think things through before acting on it, something Pre-High Me would never had done.

I have gained weight in the gut, I'm not as motivated, and im always tired. Being in my late 20s with that attitude and working corporate is a no no. 

It has been 6 days since I sparked up and so far everything is starting to make sense. The only negative feeling I'm experiencing is lack of sleep. I probably slept for 10 hours the last 2 days. I feel as if I've wasted my time smoking when I could have been in the gym working out or develop some type of skill.

Congrats to you all on your success today, whatever day you're on. I really look forward to coming here and seeing y'all supporting and celebrating each other. 

The mood swings are real. The headache that is draining me of my energy is real. My appetite is coming back, but my digestive system is still so fucked that it's accompanied by waves of nausea and sometimes it's less painful to eat even when I feel like I cant. I know my body needs nutrition, but sometimes white bread is all I can manage. 

But, I feel like I'm giving myself the opportunity to be me again, even through the struggle. After feeling like I could only enjoy life if I was high, I'm getting back to singing and dancing in the car like a maniac, being more patient and keeping my stress down, and genuinely appreciating my life for the gift that it is. 

We all know we are struggling with something inside, that turns us to use. We know it's so easy, that the physical pain and the emotional burdens we carry can be temporarily whisked away with a hit or two (or three, or four...). We are all making the choice to face our reality and our demons head on, stop masking them by dumbing ourselves down with weed, and working harder than we have before for our own futures. THAT is not something most people have the guts to do, even if they've never put a mind-altering substance in their bodies. 

I'm proud of myself, I'm proud of all of you. We woke up and decided to face another day head on. We are looking our demons in the eyes and putting them in their place, not letting them run our lives, at least for today. I think if we can show strength like that today, we are only building more for tomorrow. 

I'm gonna go bury myself in my blankets until this headache goes away (has anyone else had trouble getting warm? Since I quit ive been cold constantly). Stay tough, you got this.",19

And now I can't get back into the technique I was using, it's driving me insane. I was so excited, I've never really been able to use falsetto before without sounding like mickey mouse. I played with my voice a lot over the past month and a half though, and I finally figured out how to make the soft/breathy sound I've been longing to create for years.

My mood is shit and I keep getting frustrated within minutes. It's really important to play around and have a little fun when you're trying out new things with your voice. Being angry and frustrated just locks everything up. I sound as bad as I did the first day I started singing. FUCK.

I developed depression and anxiety and would smoke to try to get that same sense of fun I used to have when I was younger when I would get high, but instead it would just amplify my negative feelings, especially anxiety. 

I felt compelled to smoke and I would hate it every time, but was looking to weed to make me happy and lift my spirits.

Crazy how you can do the same negative thing over and over and not recognize what it does to you. 

Since I quit a few months ago my depression and anxiety have almost diminished! The thing I was drawn towards to cope was actually contributing to my negative emotions and mindset. Now I have the drive and motivation to work on myself. I’ve never been more content in my life!

It was getting easy for a while there but honestly this past week I've been thinking about it again. Coronavirus hit me hard this week, I've just been eating and sleeping and feeling bad basically... and if that's all I'm doing I might as well smoke too right?? Maybe it'd help me decompress like I need to and then I can get back to it?

Looking ahead I just feel exhausted, and thinking about the long term I want to cry, I have no idea what the future holds for my job (I've been laid off for 2.5 months now) and I'm all fucked up about climate change now too.

I've fought so hard for so long to improve my mental health, and these past couple years I was actually happy. For the first time in my life (I grew up in an abusive house). It sucks to have that all taken away from me now. I worked so hard to build a social life and good routine, and overcome my natural depressive desire to stay inside all day and watch netflix. But now, thanks to the state of the world, I'm right back to netflix (except I don't even have the fortitude to watch a TV show right now, I just browse reddit or facebook or some shit).

I feel like I'm watching the apocalypse unfold. The economy will never recover and humanity has made the planet unsuitable for human life. I know my therapist would say ""that's catastrophizing, do some meditation."" But even if I pry myself away from these thoughts I'm right back to them an hour later, and I can't just go out with friends or to the gym like I normally would. I'm talking lots of walks but I just think about this shit on my walks.

Anyway, this isn't really weed-specific anymore, I just rambled. That's just my headspace, which makes weed seem so fine and OK and maybe even helpful to indulge in.

I decided that I'm not going to smoke today. I started laundry and cleaned the kitchen. My esteem is already up a little bit. I still don't have energy and it all feels kind of pointless. But today I won't smoke, and that's a victory.

I've not smoked since Sunday evening (around 3 days ago) due to dealer issues, 
prior to this i'd smoked up to a quart every 8 days for maybe 7-8 years. 

It's been tough, sleep has alluded me, i've gotten angry over trivial things but 
it's also allowed me to gain some perspective. For the first time i realise 
how dependent i was on getting high. Prior to now I can't remember the last time 
i went a day without smoking.

I've not once thought about quitting until now and that scares me. It's so easy to 
maintain the habit, getting into unhealthy routines, rationalising poor decisions /
laziness / neglecting commitments/friends/girlfriend.

If you're getting high every day, you can't reflect on your own behaviour.

For anyone who finds themselves in my situation, it's an opportunity, don't waste it.
Talk with your partner / friends you trust. Read other peoples experiences online, write down
the pros/cons of smoking. Think about where you wanna be in 5-10 years. 

Tips for getting through the first 3 days without weed

 - Force yourself to eat something, you're appetite will likely go
 - Avoid stress at all cost
 - Exercise, if you can make the switch and start chasing that endorphin high, you're health
   and bank balance will benefit.
 - If you smoke tobacco, don't try to quit both in one go

Please feel free to respond with your own experiences / struggles, i'd love to hear them!

Iv been smoking now for about 16 years started when I was 15, managed it with no effort till my early 20s, that's when it started to slowly turn into a crutch, got to that point youd wake up and first thought when rousing from sleep was did I have bud.

First it was something to do with my mates 
Then it was something to chill with after a crap day at work 
Then it was something to look forward to each day planning my day around when was best to have a smoke

I quit for 6 months when I was 20, thought i could go back to how i was when i started, just casual at weekend or whatever but just started smoking all the time again.

In 2015 I had a kid and since then I feel like i quit every week and whatever happens or crops up and then I'm back on it again.

I have a mate who iv been smoking with from the beginning, who quit about 18 months ago, hes abit of a dick so asking how he managed it results in things such as ""I didnt smoke it again""

I'm 5 days off it at the mo and it like makes me sad the thought of not having a smoke again, I suppose I smoked mainly out of boredom and simple habit.
Just struggle to find anything to look forward to.

I suppose my only questions would be anyone thats smoked as long as I have, how long did it take for u to stop? and how long before you stop thinking how having a smoke would make whatever your doing more enjoyable?

I've scheduled an appointment with an addiction counselor in just a few days, and I've begun opening up to my parents about problem. 

But I'm terrified that the damage is going to be severe and I'm struggling to cope with the anxiety. 

For reference, I'm 23 and I've consumed roughly 610ml of high THC oil (240ml of 30mg/ml, 2 at 25mg/ml, and 1 at 20mg/ml CBD) over the course of a 14 1/2 month period (about 1.4ml a day), though there were various days/weeks where I stayed sober leading to a number of binge periods (2.5ml). This is in addition to 43.5g of on average \~18% THC (though some were CBD instead) over a 17 month period.

As of about mid-march, I've been weening off and going several days/weeks without feeling compelled to consume again. I don't feel like I've damaged my brain since I've still been doing well in university and my papers still feel about as strong as they were before all of this; however, I'm terrified that my brain is just going to decline going forward and I'm scared shitless.

I am/was smoking weed for 5 years straight, every day and most of the day. I was smoking huge amounts of weed by just myself, aswell with some of my friends. Started smoking when I was in high school, even though I was around it many years before, I just thought that high school was the right starting time.

During my high school days I was working aswell, so after work (which was usually before school) I would get high, then go to school and get even more high, then we would group up after school and smoke again, then go home and go out and smoke even more. So needless to say, I was high all the time.

Even back then, I was reading quite a bit so I always did reset my tolerance by going off weed for a month or two, only to return back even more thirsty for weed and smoking even more grams.

When my peers were expanding their social circle and getting girlfriends, I was getting high. When my peers were doing best they could in school, I was going there high and just didn't care. When my peers were saving up money for driving licenses, clothes etc, I wore couple years old clothes and spent all of my money on weed. All of this lead to me being socially isolated with a small group of friends, some of which were just stoner friends (there just to get high) and some were real friends who I still talk to daily.

When I was 1-2 years into smoking daily, me and my friends went to get a zip so we met up with my plug who decided to stay with us while we smoke just to have quick chat. I'll never forgot what happened when he pulled me aside - he asked me a simple but very interesting question, why all of my friends were single with no girlfriends. I didn't knew what to answer, then he told me ""because they're getting high nonstop, no girl likes a guy who's practically getting high nonstop, does nothing with his life, looks like shit and has no money because he spent it all on weed"", btw this is coming from a guy (my plug) who at that time was 35+ years old with couple decades under his belt in the plug game. I did think about it, but I thought its just because people choosed it that way.

Funny enough, that was me just half a year later, spending all I had on weed, being completely asexual while I was high (turned girls down, didn't care, wasn't motivated to pursue girls, etc), prioritized weed over girls, was extremely open about my usage, etc, which lead to me being now 20 years old with no experience at all, never had sex, never held hands, never kissed anyone, never had relationship, nothing, and even worse, half the city considers me as a junkie, and girls are quite conservative here.

What about the friends? The stoner group? I don't talk to most of them, I just have one friend right now who still smokes from time to time, I just realized most of them were there because misery loves company and to smoke without paying, all in the name of friendship.

1. Not to state the obvious, but working out really is a great way to remind your brain you're staying healthy. Workout at a time that you would usually smoke your heaviest, it will help stop those cravings for a relapse.

2. Get a sleep tracker. We all are losing sleep over our addiction, I've found having a sleep tracker reflects that poor sleep and somehow just by recording my sleep pattern, my sleep has improved. This also helps you realize you may need a daytime nap to function. If you have a smartwatch you can probably find an app to track sleep there. Strive for 8hrs. The science is no joke.

3. Sobriety tracker. Theres a range of apps you can find for this, find a sobriety tracker that allows you to add a widget to your home screen. This way you can see your days sober without having to go into an app every time.

4. Calorie counter. If you get serious about working out or losing weight, a calorie counter is just an extra bit of fuck around before a meal, instead of getting high before eating, you enter your calorie intake and feel better for looking out for yourself. Myfitnesspal by under armour seems to have all the foods in the world that you can search and add before or after meals.

5. Spend time with family or roomates, even if you're not up for it. If you have some kind of family game, challenge them more often to pass time (mine is a pool table). Or start a Netflix series with them, the goal is to spend the least time in a room by yourself.

6. Just basic ol cleaning. I was extremely messy when I was smoking weed, my room was literally disgusting. See your room as a representation of your life, room is messy so are you. Being in a clean environment really uplifts your mood and can make you feel productive.

I hope I'm not just posting what has already been said and advised but these 6 things really really have me feeling on top of my game. Some of these are unachievable with work schedules but most of us in quarantine shouldn't have a problem implementing them.",4

After one day or two, I just start reminiscing on the times, lying to myself, and looking for excuses to get back to smoking (searching for “successful stoners” on google when I know pretty well that each individual is different, and that just because Carl Sagan used to light up, that doesn’t mean it works for me)

Anyway, I am 72 hours sober now (got rid of my stash again) and I realize I don’t know myself as a sober person. The past years are just a cloud of smoke, I have lost so many opportunities and I know that when I am high i am not as productive - so why do I still continue to idolise being high ? I think a lot of it is the fact that I am just used to being a stoner and am afraid of what comes next.. maybe I do t want to grow up and have responsibilities and be a successful guy. Maybe I am too damaged from my childhood (whenever I am sober I get very anxious about my violent past). I really don’t know but want to find out who the fuck am I ! Can I win at this game of life ? I tend to think that I am smarter than the people I grew up around - but they are slowly surpassing me in their lives - having a healthy relationships, having successful businesses, working their asses off -, while I can’t seem to reach the next level.

I (25f) was hitting a dab pen all day every day for at least a year and it really fucked up my life. 

So I usually wake up at about 8-9am everyday, and fall asleep around midnight. this sleep schedule is a lot better than the nonexistent one I had before I quit, though the past few days I’ve been quite fatigued and napping a couple hours in the day. Not too worried abt it.

What I am mildly worried about: Since the days I started cutting down, even before I went cold turkey, I have had very bad stomach and digestive pains throughout the day. Particularly in the morning and the evening, and I have severe constipation in the evening. I’m drinking 2+ litres of water a day, a fibre supplement, and taking a daily laxative. definitely helps clear me out in the morning but by the end of the day I’m bloated and gassy and on the toilet every hour anyway. I’ve been reading others’ stories about this problem so I know it’s not abnormal and I’ve had minor IBS episodes in the past. but holy shit man when does it end??

What I am more worried about: For about a week? now, every evening at about 9-10pm, it’s like my immune system says “bye, see ya tomorrow, gl buddy,” and everything begins to hurt. Like my entire body: Headache, muscles ache, joints ache, nausea, as if I were sick with a fever. I understand my body is freaking out after removing a chemical it had become reliant on, and gosh I’ve always been sensitive to any type of drug, but feeling sick all the time is really taking a toll on my (now improving!) mental health as well. Any idea when this might pass, or if it could be a different underlying issue?

BUT! Here are some lovely positives I’ve experienced so far!

- Brain fog is clearing more and more every day (other than the times I feel very ill), I can finally think about my future and what I really want to do with it
- I’m feeling, what’s this? hope? HOPE? it’s been a long time since I’ve seen her around
- I’m crying like I used to, which to me means crying at the happy things too. means I’m feeling real emotion again
- I can dream again, and I love dreaming
- I have panic disorder anyway, so I have a prescription to manage anxiety, but even that wasn’t handling initial withdrawal panic attacks. most days i’d wake up to an attack. This was a very big part of deciding to quit, bc I was starting to experience this even just 12 hours after my last hit. but since the first week of quitting, anxiety has significantly decreased!! no more morning meltdowns, I feel so free!
- the whole body night sweats sucked but they too went away after a week
- despite my digestive system doing backflips, overall nausea has decreased significantly since first days of withdrawals
- y’all ever experienced a brain zap? yea I was sometimes ingesting so much thc for my tiny body that my brain felt like it was on fire when I was high. I would never wish that sensation on anyone. dab pens are demons in disguise, thank god that’s over. 

Something I’ve seen ppl talking about recently that I’ll address quickly is dissociation and dr/dp. I have a dissociative disorder, I experience depersonalization in particular almost every day. And yes, there has been a noticeable increase since I’ve quit weed. Doesn’t bother me much as this has been part of my life for a long long time, but please look into grounding techniques if you are experiencing these symptoms. They make a world of difference. 

Sorry if anything doesn’t make sense, and that this is all over the place and that it’s the longest thing ever, it’s past 10pm lol I’m in pain and on edge and I wrote all of this out of order bc my mind is so scattered. I feel better now though, just typing this all out. Gonna do some bedtime meditation!

tldr: Anyone else still feeling really sick this far in? And for those whose PAWS included stomach / digestive issues, how long did it last?",2

Yes it makes food better, yes it can take boredom out of the question, yes it does help some people. But for an everyday person like myself, with no real medical conditions it doesnt do anything apart from numb my thoughts and zones me out of the real world. 

Only a week ago I had a jar full of pre rolled j's that i made. I smoked my last one yesterday and gave away the rest to people I know who smoke so I've got no option but to go cold Turkey. 

I'm not one who struggles with addiction, but I knew weed had a grip on me when all I was thinking about was ""this would be better high"", well it's time to stop and suppress all of that.

My body didn't handle it well. Coughing up black phlegm, emotional yoyo, months of sleeping problems, acne everywhere. And the eating, I lost 5 pounds on my already skinny frame. Food tasted like garbage. I still have a hard time eating. I used weed to help me eat. 

I got high a few day's ago not thinking much about it. It really brought back all the things I enjoyed about getting high.

THE ENERGY, it gave me energy to do things. I would clean my room, do art, exercise. . But the mental boost, changing my mind set. I remember being so happy. I could focus and get things done. This was at the beginning. I started to abuse it and would crash and burn.

What's stopping me from going to pick up weed is remembering the withdraw. It was so bad. My face looked as bad as I felt. I had acne all over my face. I couldn't sleep well for a year ( I still don't sleep well) . Hence, why I went on anti-depressants. I wake up once or twice every night to go pee. I'm told I have a over active bladder. I never had problems sleeping when I was doing weed every night. The weed made me sleep 7-8 hours straight.

I developed sleep problems.

I feel like I want to smoke week just to return to sleeping a full 8 hours.

I was working and sleeping maybe 6-5 hours. I was so depressed because I WAS SO TIRED.

I can't go back to that after quarantine. I get 8 hours of sleep in now but that's because I can sleep in.

I started smoking when I was 18 when my friends invited me. I started buying when I was 19 and then started smoking everyday, multilple times a day. 

I felt it helped me cope with depression and anxiety. It came into a point where I could smoke like 10 joints a day. I was never sober. 

I’m 24 now and I feel all the bad effects weed has and I can recognize how much I depend on it. I have been slowing down. I smoke a joint in 3 days. But I don’t feel it helps with depression and anxiety anymore. In fact, I feel all these bad feelings even deeper. 

I wanna know if you guys can help me to quit for good. I always try and stay sober for 2 months and then get back at it. I really struggle to keep on cause all my friends and coworkes smokes. So i thought maybe I can do it cause of quarentine.

I start abstaining, fasting, running etc. I go *wild* into just getting it. I feel like Rock Lee dropping his weights.. and then I romanticize, end up liking a girl who likes me or something and get complacent because I receive the slightest form of external validation.


I smoked heavy from 13 to 18, worked in the mine for
a few months and then smoked from then until 21. At 21, I went back to the mine for over a year until I got a house. I didn’t plan on smoking but I ended up with a more lenient job.. So I’ve been smoking a half/week since last October. 


Every bag of weed I get is my barrier to my better self, it’s an excuse to not face that possessive ambition and the higher standards for myself. I just got out of an engagement and even started drinking a bit. I haven’t gotten black-out yet but I’ve just been drinking and smoking.. I tripped the other day and had *zero* reflects, *no* ego-death. I just kept drinking and smoking.

He doesn’t see my issue clearly, and he doesn’t understand why I can’t just smoke less. It’s not that easy. The only way I quit my soda addiction was by not having soda in the house for over month, but I know that’s not fair to him, but it’s hard to say no when it’s so close.

The one thing that's really getting me is the anger. I was one of those people who used weed to even out my personality and make me more patient and willing to deal with stuff, which worked great until it didn't and I just felt numb/my anxiety got worse. Now that I'm off it I'm definitely feeling everything really deeply and taking in the reality of all my emotions which in a lot of ways is beautiful but I'm also just getting so mad and fed up with everything. I just want to scream as loud as I possibly can and punch a hole in the wall, both of which I know aren't really productive or conducive to me getting anything done or feeling better but those are the most immediate impulses whether I choose to listen to them or not.

I had to quit playing fortnite because I was playing team rumbles and I'm not that good, so every time I would die and respawn I would just be yelling at my switch when someone would come up from behind and kill me before I even had a chance to turn around. It wasn't pretty. I feel super clearheaded which is great but I'm just soooo irritable and angry I feel like someone who other people would describe as a pissy little bitch they don't want to be around. I think I'm also ruining my relationship because my girlfriend is going through a lot right now and rather than support her all I can focus on is little dumb insecurities that make me think she's going to leave me/she is just kind of over our relationship but doesn't want to break up with me for fear that I would be crazy or just because she feels bad, despite that probably not being likely to happen(I'm trying to give you insight into the irrational side of my mind, but I'm also very capable of seeing a rational perspective on it too I'm not only seeing it through this insecure anger lense lol) and I'm angry because I have no control over this current situation with lockdown and haven't seen her in a while, but then we're talking every day about how much we miss each other.

My anxiety is getting worse . In the past 2 weeks, I've been CONVINCED that I had 3 different cancers with really only 1 symptom of each that is a very ambiguous symptom that could be many things. I have now gotten to a point though where I can just tell myself ""chill dude, you're not bleeding you don't have any weird pains it's impossible that you have cancer""

I'm a lot more jaded too. I'm a music producer for a living and I was so full of excitement for certain styles I was working on, now I look at some of that stuff and I'm just like ""this is dying and played out why even bother"" which just feels like a jaded old man even tho I'm only 23... Like I produce house/techno and I also make trap beats and all I could think when I heard that new NAV album is ""this is the final credits for this trap era of music, what's the point of making these beats anymore it's just going to be outdated and dead"" whereas before I was just really excited to explore sonic textures and new musical ideas regardless of that.

that being said with other styles I'm working on like techno in particular feel like they're on fire and I'm REALLY excited to pursue those/see where those are going in the future so I think this is just focusing me more on what I really care about and I'm tuning out the stuff I was working on just because I perceived it to be what other people care about.

This sucks. The world isn't dull, I'm not depressed those things aren't an issue I'm just fucking sick of feeling this way and I'm probably gonna tear my life apart before it gets better it seems. even though i know getting high might chill me out it still just doesn't seem that pertinent. Like i dont really want to even get back into that space, because this is so intense that would just cloud it I'd rather just keep feeling this realness.

A common thread in this sub are posts along the lines of “Anxiety after 3 days... normal?” Or “can’t sleep after 3 weeks... anyone else?” More generally, they are of the variation, <insert some mental/emtional/physical problem> after <insert some relatively short period of abstinence (call it less than 6 months)>. I want to take this post to reassure anyone that this is absolutely normal. In fact, it’s a huge part of sobriety. 

We have to remember that our brain is just like our body in the sense that it needs time to heal and recuperate. Rest assured, it WILL recover given a long enough time. When I gave up marijuana I suffered a pyschotic break and ended up in a psych ward. I was told by the doctors that the full recovery of my mind would take AT LEAST a year. As an addict this pissed me off. I have known one thing throughout my life, and that is a quick fix for anything that makes me uncomfortable. Before I found drugs and alcohol it was quick emotional flare ups that provided that, but once I found pot, I never had to feel unsettled again (unless I ran out of it lol). I have never known what it’s like to deal with my problems as a normal person. The people in recovery have taught me that it is okay to hurt. Pain is a normal part of life. People in recovery have also shown me that I need to learn to work through this stuff sober. I have to accept pain as it comes and be okay when I have to sit in it. 

Insomnia, anxiety, anger, resentment, sadness, regret, and fear have been a constant part of my story, and there have been times where I wanted to just say, “screw it,” and go back out. I am fortunate that I never acted on these feelings. The most important thing is that I spoke up to my peers in recovery when I felt like throwing it all away, and they helped me through. So, please continue to be vulnerable and open when things aren’t okay. Today we don’t have to use over those things because we have each other. One of my favorite books says, “sometimes human beings just have to sit in one place for a while and like hurt.” It is 100 percent okay to be NOT OKAY.

I start a new job as an investment review analyst next Monday and I'm tired of not remembering things, solely craving the next bowl or joint, crawling away to be by myself instead of putting myself out there to meet new people, and just overall sick of being a stoner.  Not to mention the cost. Fuck that noise. I need to do this for myself, but I'd like to invite any of you who want to go along my journey.  Relate with me, ask me what I'm doing, skip past this if you don't vibe with it, do whatever you need.  I've tried many times in the past, succeeding for short stints like so many of us have.  But this is it.  I'm going for it.  Hoping to journal as I go along this bullshit.  Here we go!",3

I'm 27, and it's been around 9 years since I started smoking heavily. The first time that I quit, I used to smoke almost every day (morning till night) for maybe 3 years and I struggled to overcome my addiction the first 15 days... it lasted a couple of months since I started smoking again but in that period I discovered all the advantages of quitting, more energy, memory gain, better performance at work,  better sex drive and overall, happiness of doing things i'll never do if i was high. 

Since then, weed consumption for me has been a rollercoaster. I've accomplished many things because I learned to be productive and only smoke on the weekends after the first time I quit. But I found myself over the years quitting for months and then relapsing. What is for sure is after one puff, I start smoking again, it's never a one time experience, and a couple of months later I found myself in the same position that I am now, recognising that I'm addicted to pot and I will never control my addiction while using it, it will always control me.

I've been in quarantine for two months, and I live abroad doing a master. When this started I had three weeks without classes, which means that for three weeks I only smoked weed. When class started, I lowered the consumption throughout the day, but started smoking the same amount as before but only in the night because I was unable to sleep if im not very high.

I know that I can quit and I know what I need to do to make it happen... what I don't know, and would love to hear someones' opinion is:

&#x200B;

* Many of my friends back home, and in my master smoke regularly and I don't feel that I have to stop being friends with them, because i've quitted while staying in touch and hanging with them. Have anyone quitted for good without loosing contact with their friends? Can someone explain a similar situation or whatever... Most of the relapses on the last 3-4 years that I've had have come through close friends. Maybe the answer is pretty clear, but I guess i'm afraid of it.

I guess that there's a reason why I've lasted almost a year without smoking and come back, and keep doing this over time. I just need to find the patterns and hopefully someone could help me.",3

It was a normal day and I had probably already taken about 5 dabs by 9:00. I also drank a mikes hard which isn’t that out of the ordinary. I went to lay down and I felt a sudden panic come across my whole body, like something I’ve never felt before. I shot up and my boyfriend looked at me like I was going crazy. I have a hard time explaining how I feel but at that moment I felt like I was going to die. My bf asked me what was wrong and I told him I had a crazy amount of anxiety, it was even worse because it was like it came out of no where. My whole body was uncontrollably shaking and I felt my heart pounding. Nobody could calm me and I couldn’t calm myself. This went on for about an hour and at that point my bf started asking if we should call an ambulance, which was already running through my head because I really thought I was gonna die. The ambulance came and I told them all I did was some dabs and drank a mike, which isn’t out of the ordinary. They hooked me up to a machine and saw my heart was at about 180BPM. Seeing that made me even more nervous because that is not normal. I asked the paramedic what he thought was wrong and he said he thinks I should go to the hospital for so,e further tests because that’s a high heart rate for even an anxiety attack he said. They gave me some Ativan which brought my heart rate down to about 120 and they ran multiple EKG’s on me. I have a doctors appointment in 4 days. I’m still feeling quite sever anxiety 4 days later and slowed down my dabbing a little. I want to quit but I’m scared. I’m already going through it and I feel like quitting will make it worse. I’m strictly a dabber and have a really high tolerance and terrible self control. It’s been about 24 hours since I last took a dab. I don’t think I can quit cold turkey so I was thinking I could use flour to help my self try to wean off to where I can hopefully quit completely. But when do I quit the flour? Quitting is mind boggling to me though because every hour of every day for 4 years I’ve been high and I don’t understand how I lived before I smoked. Smoking is how I pass time and I don’t have any hobbies to replace smoking with. I’m lost and alone I don’t know what to do. I can’t really turn to my boyfriend because although he smokes, he doesn’t want even come close to how much i smoke. I try telling him that I’m addicted, but he just calls me a feign and says you can’t get addicted to weed. I’m new to reddit and have been reading through some posts to hopefully get some support I need but I figured I’d make my own post. If you’ve read this far I really do thank you, I don’t have friends, all I have is my boyfriend. I don’t think I have the strength to do this on my own and I really need some advice or some wise words.",2

I use to draw every day of my life until a couple years ago when all I wanted to do was get high to get rid of my emotional pain from ptsd. The ptsd just kept getting worst too the point where if I wassnt at the peek of my high.. I was pissed off. I knew it had to stop but I didn’t know how or when. I finally started thinking about my ptsd and if there was anything I could do to help it. The thing that helped me the most was taking responsibility for all of the abuse in my life. Realizing that I could have fought and took better care of myself. I was obsessing over my abusers and wondering how and why that they did what they did. It’s all I could think about for years. Iv always had nightmares. I thought weed helped me escape but really it trapped me in that mind frame. It made me think that out side things caused this and that outside things will help. But you have to realize why you smoke and what you could have done differently even though it’s never your fault. The universe likes to throw you curve balls in order to show you that you are not on your path to staying true to your self and you purpose. We need to not ignore them and learn from them even when it’s not our fault. When you don’t treat yourself kindly, others won’t either. Iv been learning about how to forgive myself and be kind to myself in order to learn from hard ships. Iv also been reconnecting with learning about my favorite things such as art, gardening, witchcraft, spirituality, chakra. The key for me has been to keep myself busy and realize that if i’m in a negative mood it is usually due to my prospective and not Circumstance. I have the ability to control my circumstance unlike most life on earth. There for I wake up everyday grateful and learn how to get what I need in the world. Your vulnerability is not a weakness, it is a power just as important as your strength. Learn too love life but most of all love yourself and all your mistakes. For if you weren’t vulnerable you would not have anything to fight for and you wouldn’t be here. We are all one, find you place and fight to keep it 💚✌🏼🌱",2

Like not to think about the things that were depressing me at the time, and traumatic events. One of these traumatic events won't leave me alone now that I stopped smoking, and it's killing me. 

So on christmas eve I was giving my then girlfriend a lift home, somewhere outside London, I am in london. Long story short, I was going faster than I should have been, and someone tries to come into my lane, write off basically. I cant stop thinking about it. My car went into both the barriers. On both sides, the middle one and the one protecting the farms and that. My girlfriend was sleeping in the car at the time, but woke up after we hit the first median I guess and it was the worst scream I heard in my life. Neither of us were wearing seat belts. It keeps me up at night, wakes me up when I do get to sleep, and when I am awake the thought does not leave my mind. The sound of metal scraping against metal at that speed. The smell of petrol, oil, tarmac... it's all coming back to me stronger than it did at the time. Because I was high at the time. 

&#x200B;

I can not get this out of my mind. at the time she was my girl, now she's my ex, but I still can't get the thought out of my mind. When we hit the first median i could swear to you I saw her go straight through the windshield. It still fucking haunts me and I am realising I am weak, because I would rather deal with it by getting high. Not this time though I wanna work through this, I just don't know if i can ever move on? I almost killed multiple people, not because I was high but because I was speeding. Maybe the weed had an affect on my driving, maybe not, the police drug tested me and it came back negative. I was smoking three hours before, in the car. I am not telling you this so you think I am cool for passing a drug test, rather I want an outsiders opinion... 

Should I feel guilty? Because that's all I feel combined with dread and hatred to myself for speeding, getting high, and almost killing someone I still deeply care for. 

I cant get this out of my mind now that I am sober. The sound of metal on metal, the feeling in my neck of my head being pulled forward, only to be stopped because its attached to the rest of my body. Hearing someone wake up in a scream like that, from your actions. 

I guess this is one of the hardest parts about going sober, facing all the pain you have built up ignoring over the years. 

anyway, stay safe!",1

Ive done edibles 30 days in a row on multiple occasions, including right now.  Ill never be high at work or even consider driving on them.

Admittedly, my fault, the weed made me emotionless and you just can’t be around a woman that way. I went out and bought a sport car to make myself feel better. Material things barely made me feel anything at that point, all I wanted to do is smoke and fuck anything that moved. However with this car, something came back to life in me, just for a little bit. Nevertheless, I suppressed it with weed.

Fast forward to this past Saturday. My first day sober in 9 months. Some lady CLOCKED my bmw. On my first day sober. I’m a 22 year old guy, living alone, and tbh it’s hard to support myself. This crushed me. The only thing I had that was “fun” besides smoking was just ripped away from me. The only thing I had to convince myself that I could beat this thing.

When she clocked me, and I saw the car getting taken away, I lost a little part of me. And my FIRST instinct was “get high, fuck her, fuck the car, be happy”

That mindset is the MOST destructive thing that could’ve happened. And if this was like the other 7 times I tried to quit I would have caved. But something was different this time.

I KNOW the satisfaction of dealing with this problem sober will be unbelievable. I KNOW that when I get my car back I will feel on top of the world. Why? Because I was in control.

Setbacks happen. Just remember the big picture.

However, I’ve always had this haunting feeling in the back of my mind that I will NEVER truly escape it, that weed is “ok” and “a safe escape” and no matter how badly it destroys my life, I think about it before I go to bed most nights, I think about it when I have a shitty day, I think about it whenever I feel depressed and I’m really close to saying “fuck it” and relapsing again. It’s been a month and a half since I smoked last and I can still taste my last toke on my tongue, I can still feel myself floating on that cloud. It made all my problems disappear in my mind and maybe I’m just weak but I feel like I will never escape this addiction.

I’m doing fine for a few weeks and then my brother wanted me to go to the dispo for him. Of course I got myself something. And it’s weird how quickly the withdrawal goes away once you’re high again.. i only got a cheap .5 disposable. But even that made me feel guilty and what ensued was me cutting up my weed card. Point being if you are struggling with addiction you can stop yourself you just have to cut yourself off from what is enabling you to continue smoking... if you are smoking every single day and never accomplishing anything.. you have to cut yourself off and live.

     I’m 17 years old and I haven’t smoked for just over two days now. I smoked for about a year and over time it became more frequent
Since I’ve been cooped up my use skyrocketed and I started smoking first every night, did this for about a week, then realized that I didn’t want to start a habit up so I threw out everything I had, but about a week after that I impulse bought more. That was then it got worse. I continued every night, then started to in the afternoons as well, then it became right when I woke up, than it became all day long. This lasted a couple of weeks. One morning I walked into my bathroom to smoke some of my cart, and before screwed it into the pen, I brushed it with my hand into the sink and down the drain. Immediately thoughts of being caught by my parents raced through my mind, and I spent the whole morning of Mother’s Day running upstairs every ten minutes to work on disassembling my sink to retrieve my cart. Sitting on the floor on the verge of tears from the worry about getting caught, I realized that I was turning into a person that I didn’t want to be. I was overcome with emotions of guilt, regret and overall sadness. Even though my bout of daily usage was very short relative to many others, I realized that this habit did not allow me to pursue the things that made me truly happy, the ocean, the outdoors, and spending time with my family.
       Every night my usage was doubling, smoking until I couldn’t stay awake anymore, and I would wake up the next morning with little recollection of the rest of my night after I stopped.
    My family has a history of addiction and throughout my life I have come to realize that I certainly have an impulsive and addictive personality, and want to use this newfound knowledge to prevent myself from making mistakes that my relatives have. 
    As it is 2am and I cannot sleep as for the past couple weeks I have been basically smoking myself to sleep, this past probably comes off as a poorly written stream of consciousness, so forgive me for that, but thank you for welcoming me into this community.",5

I’m irritable, moody, I have weird dreams, I am suffering a lot of back pain that also contributes to my moodiness. Im a 29 year old female. Been smoking for about 6 years. Always used a vape mostly at the end of the day Because I was not the type that could function high. Just graduated from my 3 year masters program this week and was accepted into my Phd program which starts in October. So I feel like smoking hasn’t kept me from being productive in that sense. 

ALL I have been thinking about lately is smoking! The stress of this world we live in, the fact that everyone is so hateful. I am also getting ready to move across country (Cali to Alabama) for my husband who is military. All I want to do is smoke and relax. The constant guilt that comes from thinking about breaking my streak is whats preventing me from buying a new vape! I also deal w a lot of anxiety and the vape helped a lot.. I just want to know when I will feel myself again. I feel so bad for my husband who has to deal w my mood swings and all my emotions. 

My brain tells me if this shit was federally legal and didn’t have a stigma I could smoke guilt free. Whats the diff between those who go home and drink wine? (What my brain tells me)

I feel more depressed if anything which is not like me. I guess Im asking if others felt the same and how long till you started to feel normal?

I love how clear my brain is and my focus. Its just my mood. Maybe its because the pandemic and everyone’s negative energy that I definitely absorb but I don’t know.

I feel like this is a case of never ending PMS!! I feel good that I made it this far, which is what keeps me going! But my brain is really pushing me closer and closer to going and buying another vape!! 
I always think “everything is good in moderation” but maybe thats just my brain trying to convince me to smoke again.

I'm a little worried about the upcoming week. In the past, I usually find around the one week mark, I start to get depressed and feel very off, but I'm hopeful that this time I'll do better since I weaned off instead of going cold turkey like in the past.

The only time I quit longer than 9 days was when I was pregnant and had a reason other than myself to quit. Babygirl is now two and a half. 

I just am so quick to emotion right now. Crying every day. Angrier than I normally am. I'm scared that I will go back to smoking because I'm a raging bitch right now. I also am drinking more to compensate. Which I know isn't great but I can't imagine being a completely sober human. Huge kudos to those who can do that! 

I struggle with depression and anxiety and have been medicated for 7 years probably. My dad is a recovering alcoholic since I was little. I went through some trauma when I was 6-7-8. When I really think about it, I think I smoke because it helps me numb/ignore the feelings of sadness. When I stop smoking, I get confronted with feelings I don't want to face. 

Most of my friends smoke. I know they will be supportive of whatever I do and they have been when I've quit/slowed down my smoking before. 

My wife is amazing. She and I smoked together for a long time, but honestly I've been smoking way more than her for the past 5 years at least. She gets anxious now, and I guess I do too, but overall I feel like weed makes me feel less anxious. 

I've been smoking before work which sucks since I could lose my job if they knew. I've been pulled over a few times with weed in the car, but honestly I think since I'm an educated, white chick in Wisconsin I've gotten away with it. 

I really want to succeed in quitting, but I also really want to smoke. Each day is really hard. I'm extremely irritable right now. It's easy for me to tell myself, well if I smoke, I will be nicer/happier/more pleasant to be around. That's all true. So how do I go about sticking with not smoking?",10

I’m only 18 years old. I used to always say “I can quit whenever I want, I just enjoy it.” Or “weed isn’t even that addictive.” Over time, I began to realize that my memory was getting pretty bad. I didn’t care too much at first, but it got worse. Not only did my memory fade, but so did my motivation to do my work or even basic tasks. I started taking tolerance breaks, but only to get a better high from smoking. I quickly realized how difficult it was to go without smoking for only a week or two. This is when I realized that actually quitting would be harder than I anticipated. As you can imagine, I started to not gain anything at all from smoking. Every time I smoked, I would only be able to point out the things I don’t like about it. That didn’t stop me. Eventually, I decided “I’ll only smoke on weekends.” That didn’t work. Then it was “I’ll only smoke with friends.” That didn’t last either. For the sake of my mental and physical health, I decided it was time to quit. I lasted almost 1 month... then I went to a reggae festival, and I decided to celebrate what I had achieved for the occasion, then I would stop again. Every time I’ve ever tried to smoke “just this one time” I would immediately fall back into my routine of smoking everyday. It’s gotten to the point where if I smoke, bad things happen. Usually relating to me forgetting something or getting overwhelmed with negativity. I’ve reached the point where I’m fed up. I’m tired of justifying my bad habits. I’m tired of falling into a repetitive schedule. I’m tired of being distracted from the life I want to live. It’s time for me to start making the right decisions and taking actions that will benefit me, not slow me down.
In 2 weeks, I will be 1 month sober for the first time in my life since I started smoking, and I have never felt better. I rarely even crave it anymore. I can’t wait for it to be out of my system. It’s tempting when I’m constantly surrounded by it, but every time I have those thoughts, I ask myself: what are you doing it for? What good is this bringing you. And I can never come up with a good answer. This keeps me from relapsing again. The r/leaves community has helped me so much by realizing I’m not alone. Weed used to make me happy, but not anymore. I’m really determined this time. I will NOT relapse.

I’ve quit before for drug tests as I was a college athlete, however, that was always with an end date to my break in sight. I work at a major corporation, enjoy my job, and lead a pretty successful life on paper. Luxury car, in shape, decent social life, etc.

Despite all of these great things occurring in my life, I have accomplished them all while being high. All day. Every day. For three years. To think about the wasted time. Not to mention my relationship with my ex girlfriend fell apart 100% due to weed.

The point to all this? I’ve tried to quit before but never could. These past 9 months of smoking 2 grams a day has made me utterly insane. I came to a realization a week ago, while high, that this is not an acceptable way to live life. There is so much more to be accomplished, built and seen.

To anyone out there, in my personal opinion, there isn’t a point to taking the step unless YOU truly believe you are ready. Without that mentality you are bound to fail. feel free to disagree but after about 6-7 times trying to quit this is what I’ve found

I will touch base and let everybody know about my progress! Now that I’m ready, despite the withdrawal, I am happier and am starting to find joy in hobbies I would have never picked up.

I have no shame in who I am. I am an addict. And I’ll be ok.

I was so insecure and full of self loathing that I felt I needed to be fucked up in order to accept myself. Not true. I don’t know how many of you are religious, but I’ve also decided since I quit drugs to rededicate myself to my faith. I’ve been reading the Bible and praying every day, and at the risk of sounding preachy, there is a real benefit to it.

There's been breaks before, a month here,a week there but I always convinced myself that 'i can just have one on the weekend' and before I knew it I was back smoking daily again.
During lockdown I thought well it's lockdown of course I can smoke more, there is nothing else to do but it's been having such a negative effect on my mental health it needs to stop. I'm thinking of moving in with family who have all been social distancing during this period. 
 I really hope this is the final time I quit smoking weed, I've tried tapering off before and it never seems to work so I'm going in cold turkey, any of you guys got any good tips for coping with withdrawal symptoms?

Looking back on it now, after only two days of being sober its worrying to see what that could have turned into if I let my addiction run its course. 

I am starting to loose track of the days, like because I cannot sleep without it, so not I am at the point where I am sleeping whenever I can, and it does not really last that long. It is frustrating, but I do feel like it is going to back to normal, at some point, in the future. 

Motivation for anything is hard to find, even to clean my room. When I smoked, my motivation would always be, I will finish this and smoke a joint, and that was for everything. Everything. Now that I do not have this, it is hard to find motivation, really hard to even get out of bed after I 'sleep.' 

I never realised how much time I spent waiting for the dealer, and how much time in the day that actually wastes when you are picking up a 3.5 a day. Its given me a lot more free time that I am not sure how to fill during the quarantine. 

On the one hand its getting easier, but on the other hand its difficult, because I just want to pick up, one last time, get high one last time you know, but I know if I cave it will be another couple years until I try this again.

Weed always gave me the munchies, so without it I am barley eating, which on the bright side, all the shops are empty anyway... its all about the bright side, no matter how small it is lol. Also I do not have any concentration, took me 4 YouTube videos in the background and about 2 hours to write this... hopefully the time to write these will also decrease at some point... even playing games bores me after a couple games on Call of Duty or Metal Gear Solid...

Hi, recently I've stopped smoking marijuana (1.5 monthes), and lately I've been remembering memories from a lot of years ago. It's not even anything traumatic, just random events through out my life. I'm only 22 years old, and sometimes when I day dream I would remember things from like 15, 16 years ago. I remember the last time I was high, I was hallucinating past events from my life. It's hard to describe, but the best way to put it is like how they say when you die, your whole life flashes infront of you. That's how I'm feeling right now. For example, I was talking to a friend and he told me he just recently finished washing the dishes, which made me instantly remembering the first time I ever wash dishes, very vividly. It really is hard for me to focus on anything now. 

Does anybody also have this experience. Can marijuana trigger part of the memory? 

Since stop smoking I've also expereinced some dp/dr too.",7

(Bit of a read)","Hi everyone, I haven’t posted here in a long time but I decided to share a little bit today. Today is day 422 in my sobriety and despite all this crazy in the world, Life is good. 

So I joined this subreddit over a year ago when I was truly in a low place. I planned on quitting weed and was up tossing and turning for days and came here for help. I was offered support and kind words but shortly thereafter my mindset slipped into a place I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy. I believe I was awake for atleast a week straight and continued to have insomnia for nearly a month to follow. Within that time frame I experienced extremely unwanted suicidal thoughts, completely lost all personal identity of who I was, lost 20lbs and entered into a psych ward. 

At the time, I had no idea if this state of mind I was in was going to be permanent. Am I schizophrenic? Did I have a bad batch of dosed weed on my last outing? Was I too stressed from school? Or the biggest underlying factor, what did my shit sleeping habits do at the beginning of my sobriety do to my brain?

Those first couple nights I was stone cold sober I tried to take on every negative thought, every negative experience, that were spinning in my head and solve them. Tossing and turning all night wondering if I’ll have enough sleep to finish this assignment that was due, shit even if I’ll ever finish school. Then the thoughts began into massive negative self talk and even delusions of grandeur. These thoughts led me down a road holding all my failures and the horrid thoughts of should I even be alive? 

Obviously the last part put me in the psych ward and as fucked up as the whole situation was, a part of me is glad it happened. Glad that in that fucked up mindset I was in. Not knowing up from down left from right I knew one thing. And that was to ask for Help.

I entered into an outpatient program and began working on me. I took a break from school for that spring and really put in the work on myself and my mindset. The program I entered had some pretty Intense therapy and I was able to really learn a lot about myself and actively participate in what was asked of me. I remember writing my daily gratitudes at first thinking this is dumb. Shit I remember when I first got into the program that some things were dumb and “nah that won’t work” But I still tried, I still
Showed up everyday and put in some kind of effort. In all honesty, that place saved my life. Showed me how not only is my life worth living but worth living sober. 

From then on I stepped down into different group therapy sessions and eventually got back into my own individual therapy. (Whom I still talk with every couple weeks) i started working out pretty routinely And was able to finish the courses I missed out on. I even returned to my college town for my last year without smoking or even drinking out with friends. I’d still go out occasionally but chose to abstain from any mood/mind altering substance. 

When I first started my PHP and was getting a grip on what real reality is, I thought that me being sober in a party setting would be impossible. Not only was able to manage that this last year, I actually was able to  finish up my undergrad within 4 years this last semester. 

Honestly, if it wasn’t for the place I went to and the circle of support I have from family and friends zero shot I’d be where I’m at today. A sober college grad. Having my friends not pressure me to even have a beer let alone a joint was fuckin huge for me in my return to school. 

So here I am. Little over a year down in the books, regained control of mindset/life, finished up college, and looking forward to more days of sobriety. 

There’s still questions I mentioned up there that are somewhat unanswered today. For starters did my smoking lead to my psychosis? Was it the cause of me not sleeping? Was school too stressful? Did I smoke something laced? The answer to all that I have accepted is it was a perfect storm. Could I have gotten something laced? Maybe. Was I smoking too much? Absolutely. And not sleeping and eating will
Sure do wonders to your headspace. Good news is I am not schizophrenic. I am more grounded with myself then I have ever been. 


TL;DR: My poor habits lead to a psychosis, almost quit on everyone and everything. But was able to ask for help. And learn and grow from my experience.

The appetite loss, headache, body fatigue, chills, sweats. It all sucks. I had to tell my mom what was going on because she started getting worried about me.

Usually when I would go through breaks I would just have appetite loss for a few days, then be fine. However, I guess I didn’t account for my marijuana use this time and the symptoms that could come with withdraw since my smoking was prolonged and heavier since quarantine started. 

I guess I need some help. I don’t have any cravings because I’m feeling the negative effects of the weed and it’s a complete turnoff.  Also, anyone felt it a little harder to breath? I’ve read a few post that it’s the tiny lung hairs trying to remove tar?

I've been smoking daily for about 5 years now. I don't love having a daily habit. Especially when there are days that I smoke repeatedly throughout the day. But I can't seem to make myself really feel that it's time to stop. 

I want to *want* to quit, if that makes sense. 

I want to really feel the absence of everything I've been missing out on, but right now, I don't. When I've taken t breaks or even just been prohibited from day smoking due to stuff like work, I feel sharper and more creative, more confident and smarter. I do more work, start more projects. But none of it feels like enough to incentivize me to quit. 

It feels easy to say ""I'm willing to sacrifice a few IQ points if it means I get to be light up and be numb for a while."" It feels easy to say ""I'm still functional and productive and I can financially afford this."" When this habit started, in college, I was consistently a straight-A student. I almost wish I got bad withdrawals or something, because the lack of withdrawal makes it easy for me to say ""it's no big deal if I light up, I can always quit later."" 

I can white-knuckle through, sure. It's not even hard for me anymore. I no longer feel the same anxiety around being sober that I used to. But it honestly doesn't feel worth it to be sober a big amount of the time. 

It's like there's a big hole in me that I can fill with smoke. Without that smoke I just have to exist with this hole in me and that's terrifying. 

I'm in therapy. My shrink figures part of the reason I smoke is because I'm anxious and hard on myself and my brain goes bad places when it's quiet. We're working on helping it not go those places. He says that it'll be easier to quit if I'm not so hard on myself about my weed use. But that feels really counterintuitive, like I'm just being okay with being addicted. 

What made you feel that it was really time to quit? Especially those of you who never really faced external repercussions for your habit. What did you fill your time with? If you're like me, did it ever feel like the hole in you went away?",1

Just wanted to check in since I am coming up on 2 years without smoking weed!   


Brief background: former heavy daily smoker, smoked weed with tobacco in bongs (called poppers or ""batch bowls"" where I am from) numerous times a day, never thought I would ever quit smoking weed.   


So! It's been almost 2 years! Over the last year, I have not missed smoking weed at all. During the first year, I would sometimes think about getting high and just chilling and watching a movie and eating and having a fun time...but, other than now (writing this) I may have thought about weed...like....10 times this last year.   


I thought that after 1 year, I would celebrate and smoke weed...but the day came and went and I didn't even think twice about it. Then at 1 1/2 years I thought the same...but, again, I couldn't care about it!  


Then, 4/20 I thought I would partake...with the quarantine and the extreme boredom...but, I didn't!  


Now, closing in on 2 years.   


Just know, that you can quit. And you can make it not only hours without thinking about it, to weeks and months on end!  


Trust me...if I could quit after 9-10 years of heavy smoking, you can!

It made me feel better and confident about myself. Thing is i went back to my parent's house because i was feeling unwell because of the withdrawals. And now my dad wants me to go back to my small one bedroom appartment alone to finish my process, i dont know how to explain to him that i dont want to be alone you know. Being alone all the time recently is what drove me to smoke more and numb myself. I was basically trying to make myself sleep all the time. I would take a couple of bong hits and go to bed with the lights on and the tv still playing because it made me feel like i was back home with my parents. I don't know what's wrong with me, i had a good childhood, loving parents and we never lacked anything. I really wonder what went wrong in my life or if i have a chemical imbalance in my brain but i am the only one in my family with addiction problems. Now i have to go back to that little appartment tonight, im scared, im stressed out, i want to escape my life, i want to be done with this. I know i might be rambling but im just so unsure about everything right now. I want to go to rehab but all the programs near me are 6 months long and inpatient, i have a wonderful job that i dont want to lose and i cant put everything on hold for 6 months, well i feel like i cant. I don't know what to do. I just want someone to understand me. Thanks for listening.

I already feel more clarity, like my stupid stoner brain is receding. I acknowledged the times I felt the urge - waking up and getting ready, the drive into work, my lunch break - and reminding myself why I'm doing this until it passes. 

My appetite is shit, but I treated myself to some soup. I've been actually able to listen to my body today, its not just a constant urge to smoke nicotine and shovel food down my throat. I'm drinking water, having small meals even when I dont feel like I could eat. It makes me feel like smoking pot was masking everything my body was trying to tell me. 

Might try going for a walk tonight (don't remember the last time i did that sober), fuck it, maybe some yoga! Just trying to replace the times I'd smoke with happier, healthier, more productive things. 

Thank you all so much for your support. We can change for the better, together. 🤘",10

2020-05-11 13:16:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ghrtxt/last_night_i_decided_to_change_my_life_day_1/,Last night I decided to change my life. Day 1.,"Hello fellow humans, human fellas. The first thing that I want to say is that I went from accepting that today I'd smoke to deciding to quit after 15 minutes of reading posts in this community.

I apologize in advance for the length of this post. 

I (21M) first smoked weed in 2014, just one hit and I didn't even get high. One year later, in the summer of 2015, I started smoking more regularly. Sometimes I wouldn't get high, until I found out it was because I wasn't inhaling it properly. When summer was over, I focused on going back to high school and just smoking on parties.

In 2016 I barely smoked, after getting wasted one night with alcohol and weed and throwing up, I had had enough drugs for the summer.

In 2017 I smoked on special occasions with friends, until I reconnected with a friend of mine, let's call him Jimmy. He had tried it out once, so we started to meet to smoke. First it was on weekends, but soon I was smoking every day, and so was he. I taught him to roll joints, and I feel guilty about introducing him to the abuse of weed. 

I've been smoking daily since then. I've spent more than two full years with the daily urge to lit up just because. The only exception were some weeks earlier this year when I challenged myself to smoke only on weekends in order to lower my tolerance and get higher. In time, I relapsed when I realized that 2 days out of 7 wasn't enough for me. I realized that, through the weekdays, my hope and saving grace was thinking about Friday at 5PM, when I could smoke again. This taught me that I can't live focused on the next hit. Jimmy lived with me as my roommate and he kept smoking, which also made it harder for me. 

In my time with weed, I have thought about lots of stuff, I have embraced, rejected and changed my ideologies. I have indulged in pleasure and hedonism on a daily basis, just to find out that it is an empty life. I feel like, in some cases, such as confidence and social skills, I have gone backwards. I'm sick and tired of not being articulate enough to express myself properly, and I'm so done with the Foggy Mind. 

Last night, like every other night, I went to bed with my head hammering me, telling me that I have to stop smoking, but at the same time telling me I'm not strong enough to do it for good. I felt so much conflict within me, I just wanted the arguing voices to shut up. Until it came to me. 

Those two voices are: The Voice of Reason, which advises me of what's best for me, even though the experience may not be pleasant, and, what I call, The Voice of the Demon, which wants to put me down and make me submit to addiction and the easy road. 

The Voice of Reason can be cold and unpleasant. It will tell you to do stuff that you don't want to do. If you keep avoiding it, it will nag you, at times agreeing with The Voice of the Demon, saying that you are weak. But here's the difference. The Voice of Reason will say that you are weak, and that you must become stronger for your own good, and most importantly, that you can do it. And when you achieve your goals, the Voice of Reason will celebrate with you. 

However, The Voice of the Demon will put you down using those arguments about not being good enough, without offering anything in exchange nor any solution. It will say that you are weak and pathetic, and, when you are exhausted and down for the count, using a soothing warm voice, it will tell you to forget about that and just smoke away your problems. 

Last night, I finally looked at both sides in the face. I recognized my demons taking advantage of my addiction and shortcomings to criticize me, saying that I am a hopeless fool. 

But I also recognized Reason. It told me that I can improve. It didn't attack me personally. It wanted to see me do better. For me, that was it. I'm tired of feeding my Demons. From now on, as the days go by, I will starve them, seeing as I grow bigger and stronger and they shrink to a shadow of what they were when they ran rampant through my mind. I want to be able to look back and say: ""I'm so grateful I was smart enough to stop my addiction when I was 21 and not older."" (not shitting on people who smoke for longer, just read people's personal stories) 

I want to be able to look back and see those Demons as a distant echo of the past. A foe which fell under my will power. 

So there I was, 4:35 AM, when I decided to not smoke today. I had already asked  Jimmy to contact our dealer to get more, and today I told him to forget it. However, I still had some weed in the house. I know it wasn't the best choice, but I decided to roll a huge joint with the rest of my weed and smoke it. I came to terms with the fact that it was my last joint in the foreseeable future. I made my peace. 

I found some things which motivate me to keep going and don't give in to the cravings. First, I've been trying to start writing a story, and one of the problems that I'm facing is that my main character, although having thought of his adventures and conflicts, has no main motivation,which is the basic thing that any good character needs. I know that this is mostly due to me, the author, not having true meaning in my life. So last night I decided to assume me quitting smoking and ending this addiction as a new mission, my personal main quest. In a way, the start of my own hero's journey. 

Ever since I was a kid, I've had fantastic stories playing out in my mind. When I went to bed, I'd get right into a world. Sometimes they were already existing worlds like Avatar: TLA, sometimes it was the real world with real situations playing out differently in my mind, and some other times I'd build a story from scratch. The point is that I have some practice in constructing coherent tales and dialogue without writing any of it. By no means am I an actor, but I can try to put myself in the situation and feel what a character should feel in that moment. 

So, I used this to imagine the Voice of the Demon in front of me. And I summoned all of my rage against it. Last week I was feeling especially down and stupid. Often times I found myself undermining my own confidence in my own home. I portrayed the Demon as that voice which kept insulting me. And then, for the first time in years, I was honest with myself. 

I imagined life as a huge landscape, with ample valleys and treacherous but beautiful mountains. I saw how my actions over the last two and a half years have taken me through a plain, easy road, surrounded by a pale dead forest. I also saw other roads, more difficult, twisting and turning, sometimes going uphill. In some parts the forest was burned and destroyed. There was pain. But in others there were precious and colorful flowers and trees, full of life. 

In that moment, I remembered Uncle Iroh's words: ""IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LOOK INWARD, AND BEGIN ASKING YOURSELF THE BIG QUESTIONS: WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" 

I am myself. I am young. I am stronger than that cursed voice. And I will prove it. 

I want to beat this addiction. I want to be free. I want to be myself. I want to grow as a person. 

I was literally in the crossroads of Destiny. I have the ability to actively shape my life, and it's time to choose the right path. I stood there, face to face with my Demons. And I knew that I don't have to fight them. I just have to prove them wrong. 

This time, there is no 'reward joint' on weekends. There is no price or substance to look forward to and be subject to. There is freedom in that. 


I know the road is not going to be easy. It will be challenging. Some parts will be muddy and slow, others will be rocky and dangerous. But I also know that this path will lead me to beautiful places which I could only imagine if I walked the easy path. 

I have armed myself with motivation, reason and pride. I know at some point I will smoke again with friends and it will get me high. And the Demons will try to seduce me. But I will never again be dependent on weed. I will develop a balanced and healthy relationship with it. I don't hate weed. I hate the parts of me that want to abuse it.

One of the things I kept repeating in my mind was:
""This is the most challenging and difficult thing you have ever done in your life. Do you want to grow and be strong? Then do it. Prove those fuckers wrong. And emerge as a new, better you."" 

Another thing that I do when I'm getting worked up is closing my eyes, breathing deep and saying:"" Things aren't good or bad. They just are.""


As a side note, my friend Jimmy and I, in the current lockdown period, have returned to our hometown. He   is currently not smoking as well to avoid dependability. That makes me feel less guilty and I'm proud of him. 

Also, this summer I went on holiday with my family for a month and I didn't smoke. I didn't have the chance to do so, though, which makes it less difficult. My current objective is to go over 28 days without weed or tobacco in order to beat my previous record, this time at home.

Next September I'm going abroad to study, and I had already assumed I wouldn't smoke. But now I know I won't do it because I have to, but because I want to. That makes a huge difference for me.

Anyways, this post is probably too long by now. I have teared up just by writing this, but they were tears of emotion, not pity or sadness. With this post I strive to motivate and empower people who are in a similar situation, as well as to remind myself of why I'm doing this, and to hold myself accountable. 

I know there are some ATLA references, it's not on purpose. It's simply that this story has truly inspired me to be better. 

From I here I send my thanks to each and every person in this amazing community, as well as my strength. A lot of people say this, because it is true: You have helped save a life. Thank you.

The rest of the path is on me. But I know I will make it.",2

On school/work days I would smoke as soon as I got home, and on free days I would start smoking in the afternoon. I told myself I was a ""productive stoner"" and although that was just an excuse for my bad habit, it was actually quite true. When I was high, I would often clean my room, I would go to the gym, do groceries, cook healthy meals. Ofcourse, I did this because otherwise I would feel guilty for being high all the time and doing nothing. 

I've been ""lazy"" all my life. I've never had any motivation for school, and have never had any real hobby's beside gaming and sports. When I have a day off I am a real couch potato and don't really do anything. I like to write, but never do it. I like to read, but still I spend most time on youtube rather than reading a book. When I used to smoke daily it didn't feel like a problem, because when high doing nothing is the best thing there is, and doing little things like cleaning your room feels like a really big accomplishment. 

When I quit smoking weed I thought this would be my time to shine, and I would start being a productive human being. But the opposite is true: I became even more lazy. I do two workouts a week instead four, I spent all my free time playing stupid games or watching stupid youtube video's, and I don't even enjoy listening to music anymore (I'd listen to music 24/7). I quit my study (nothing to do with weed, I just hated it) and started doing some boring job just because I have to make money to survive. 

I hoped quitting weed would make a difference, but it didn't. I still don't have any motivation in life. Days go by but nothing changes. I feel like I'm not living. I feel apathetic. I don't really enjoy or despise anything. Life is just life and as long as I'm surviving it's OK I guess. I know there are so many things I could do to improve myself but most of the time it just makes me hate my life more. I attended University for 1,5 years but I hated every second of it. Next year I will start a new study and I really, really hope that will be something I generally find interesting but I'm scared it will just be like my last study and I will and up quitting again. 

I have friends, family and a girlfriend who all support me but the only one who can change myself is me. If I won't, I feel like I will lose them all because I'm just not a nice person right now. I'm a boring and uninterested person with no perspective in life. Thank god I'm quite a social person so I'm pretty good at faking being happy. But I know if I don't change myself it will only get worse and I will realize life it not worth it. 

I know I should seek help and I have been to 3 different psychologists but it didn't help. The only thing that would make me feel good was weed, but I know smoking weed only helps me escape reality instead of improving it. Sorry for this long post. I don't know if this is the place for it. I just hope someone can relate and share solutions or atleast make me feel like I'm not alone or crazy.",17

Help?,"Smoking for the past 5 years aside from a couple of months here and there. I know it’s doing me infinitely more harm than good. Now I want to do something about it.

I’m a 23 year old guy and was introduced to smoking about 5 years ago through a friend and his girl. This was a rough time in my life - I had fallen out with my best friend and never thought I’d see him again or that he’d want talk to me again, so was spending more and more time with this group of people. 

Fast forward to today and I am now friends with him again and have been for the past two and a half years or so. Things are now better than ever but one thing I have always tried to hide is that I smoke. He knows I do it now and again, but nowhere near the level that I am - currently, I’m spending around £20 a day on weed and while that might not sound like a lot to everyone reading this, it’s a lot to me and all adds up over the course of a month. I also feel that I am spending more money on food, takeaways, etc than I need to: all consumable shite, meaning I have nothing to show for the decent money I am earning from my job.

I’ve always been big, but I have put on so much weight through smoking and find myself not really eating throughout the day, then eating like mad at night. I don’t have any appetite if I go without smoking, obviously this passes after a few days - my issue is making it that far.

Weed is also impacting on my social life too, as obviously most of the time I’m awake I’m stoned and I don’t want him to see me stoned. Tonight, he asked to meet for a cigarette which would’ve been the first time I’d have seen him in about 6 weeks due to lockdown/ isolating. I declined...because I was stoned. I had to make an excuse. 

I feel like I am completely stuck in a rut.
I’m on decent money, but in a dead end job. 
I’m smoking from first thing in morning to last thing at night, spending around £20 a day on weed alone (excluding other things related to it, like cigarettes/ tobacco, takeaways, etc)
I am keeping secrets from my best friend because I don’t have the balls to tell him and I know he’d be disgusted if he found out. 

My mum has been very encouraging in terms of me stopping, but I really feel like I could use some advice from people in a similar situation. Please reach out via PM or reply to this. I have stopped before, started exercising, and lost weight only to start again a few months later. I need to get off this for good.

Tonight is the first night I’ve had serious insomnia. Just racing brain, kept needing to get up to do SOMETHING - watch tv, play game, build models - but nothing is feeling me relax. Kind of disappointing because my first week of detox really wasn’t that bad at all.

I’ve also noticed that, despite my hopes, I’m not really a ton more productive without weed. I handled my day job just fine as a stoner, but my side hustle projects were slipping behind. I had hoped that without the weed fog I’d have more motivation to knock those projects out and I just... don’t. Which is not making me feel good about myself at all.

My wife did her first week of detox at a rehab facility and she arrives home this evening. I’m worried because I feel like I’m nowhere near the “happy & free” feeling I had this week, and I don’t want things to get bad or weird for her because I’m just out of it. 

Anyone else relate to this? I guess I just didn’t expect to feel this bad after such a relatively good start.",1

Pretty sure I’m on day 6-7 (don’t really remember) and I had probably the worst experience I’ve ever had in my life. Everything was normal until I was watching some weird show on Adult Swim that started giving me these weird vibes. I don’t know how to describe it other than I just felt like I shouldn’t be watching it. I switched to some mindless comedy stuff and the feeling went away. 

About 15 mins later I decided to go to bed. Let my dog out to go to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, and as soon as I laid down in bed, BOOM. Suddenly I felt this weird sensation/feeling. Like I was kind of being constricted in my own body is probably the only way I could describe it. My cat jumped up on the bed, like she does every night for a few mins of pets and cuddles, and I didn’t want to even touch her which really started to freak me the hell out. I jumped out of bed and just started walking around my apartment, which made my gf get up and ask if I was ok. Told her no, I felt weird but not sure what’s going on. I’d had panic/anxiety attacks before but this felt...different. I felt like I didn’t really want to be in my body or that I wasn’t in my body or something, I really don’t know. I eventually described it to her as I felt like what I’d imagine it would feel like to lose your grip on reality.

I was somewhat familiar with the idea of depersonalization, which I figured it was, but didn’t want to actually say it bc it terrified me. I seriously thought “this is it, I’m going insane. I’m gonna have to check into a hospital for awhile” or something, which terrified me even more. Eventually my gf and I sat with me on the couch while we watched TV and talked. My dog came out after a few more mins, and even petting her didn’t help which freaked me out even more. 

After talking about for a bit, I calmed down enough to look up symptoms of a panic attack. Sure enough I saw depersonalization was a somewhat common symptom of panic attacks, which helped me calm down even more. I’m typing this as she’s asleep on the couch next to me, and I want to go to bed but I’m also kinda scared it’s going to happen again. I know it likely won’t, at least not tonight, but it was scary enough to keep me up. I kinda feel like I’m rambling at this point but my brain is still kinda foggy as I’m coming down from all of this. 

After searching depersonalization on here and seeing all the posts I wanted to make my own. Does this ever end? I’m hoping, based on some of the posts I’ve seen here, that it will go away but I’m wondering if anyone has had this continue on indefinitely. I don’t like using medication but if this is something I have to deal with for the rest of my life I don’t see another way to deal with it. I can handle the anxiety attacks I’ve had before but this...this was another level of mind fuck I was NOT prepared for. I’ll tell ya what, after all of my previous failed attempts to quit, this is definitely the thing that will make me never go back again. 

Please someone let me know if there’s anything I can do to minimize the chances of this happening.",13

Oh but it’s too hard... 

It’s hard but not *too* hard. You can do hard things. Set higher expectations for what you can do, because you can do a lot. 

That being said, this is my first post here, and this is the first step towards tackling the thing I’ve told myself I couldn’t. 

A couple weeks ago I had a stretch of 5 days where I was doing all the things I knew would bring me fulfillment. Yoga, meditation, healthy eating, hikes every day, at home work outs, waking up early, reading, focusing on guitar, no nicotine, no weed. I said fuck it and decided to give the opposite lifestyle a trial run, and you know what? 

I hadn’t been happier. That was the healthiest I’ve been my entire life. That’s a better life to live. I had energy, focus, clarity, a smile consistently on my face. I could develop coherent thoughts, was having better conversations, my thoughts and anxiety weren’t paralyzing me into a perpetual state of blah. But yet again, here I am, a couple weeks out and the trial run is over and I’m back at square one. 

It’s an ironic battle. Life was easier living it the way I wanted to. Yeah, there’s upkeep, but I’m the sole beneficiary of it all, and others around were feeding off my new found energy. It’s a win all around.  

The hardest thing I’ve had to deal with up until this point in my life is convincing myself that I can be happy. And it’s time to conquer this broken state of mind. It’s strange how all the things that I run from are the things that completeness can come from. 

No more running. I can do hard things.",6

Originally I got clean so I could pass a drug test for an upcoming new job, but as this pandemic mess has pushed back that jobs start date I’ve been sober much longer than expected. I’ve had a few days in a row where I thought “damn it’d be a nice day to smoke a joint” but I distracted myself for god knows how long (the days just blur together now) and the urges passed. Walking into my best friends room and seeing his bong and ash tray I definitely felt jealous and nostalgic, but after 3 months, not smoking feels like the new normal. I think the most difficult question for most people when they quit is “will I ever smoke again?”. I’ve thought about using weed like I do alcohol, rarely and on special occasions. But then I wonder if that’s what would really happen? would I have the self control to not start smoking regularly? is it worth the risk?
I haven’t come to a decision on that question, maybe some long time soberinos could tell me how they’ve dealt with that question.

Before I quit we used to look forward to the day we'd all get stoned with him mom for the first time. Actually one of the things he said since I quit is that it's sad I wouldn't be able to do that with her. Thought that when this happened I'd at least be able to have a drink to feel less FOMO but I've personally decided to take a break from that, too, for a bit, so that didn't happen. My boyfriend asked me if it'd bother me if he joined his family in getting stoned, and while it did, it would've bothered me more if I felt like I made him miss out on something he'd been looking forward to for a while.

I held out for most of the night, and I think I did an okay job hiding how I was feeling, but I finally ran upstairs under the guise of needing to do work and just cried. I hate myself for getting to the point with weed where I needed to quit cold turkey like I did. I hate that I did such dumb, frankly reprehensible shit while I was stoned that I'm not sure weed will ever be in my life again. I hate that for all the time I was getting high, my boyfriend didn't want to get stoned with me - and only chose to after I couldn't share that experience with him anymore. I hate that, even though I haven't touched marijuana in 10 months, I still feel this way. I wish I didn't feel so jealous. I wish I could laugh with them downstairs instead of hiding upstairs because I don't want to ruin their fun by having a big emotional outburst.

I wish I could use weed like a normal person. While that might be in my future someday, I'm sad it's not today.

I hope I learn something important from how I feel tonight, but right now I just feel awful.",64

2020-05-11 00:29:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ghgrvh/only_place_where_not_smoking_weed_feels_cool/,Only place where not smoking weed feels cool,"Wow. I never knew there were so many of us struggling with some drug that supposedly cannot be addictive. Best online community I discovered in a while.

I started smoking casually when I was around 20 ; first it was for some special occasions, always with a friend/group of friends, anytime we wanted to have some 'fun' or had a reason to celebrate. I hated smoking alone. Then it became every week-end and before I knew it, I started smoking in my workplace on Friday afternoons with my colleagues/friends as well on some workdays, or during week nights with different group of friends.

The worst was yet to come. 

Around 2015, I started smoking every night. Then it became every afternoon and night until it became everyday for every occasion. Eventually, I started smoking even when I was alone. This trend continued for around 4 years, every single day and night of smoking weed for 11 months a year. You see, stopping for one month every year gave me a false sense of being in control, that I was not addicted to it. On some days, I'd be smoking a minimum of 3 joints and on other days, I'd be lighting up at least 5-6, alone. I had to be high whether I was going to uni for my postgraduate, whether I was doing my grocery shopping, playing sports, going to the movies, playing videogames, watching Netflix, dating, going out with friends, fucking, I just had to be high all the time because you know, it makes everything better, it 'enhances' every normal, sober experience of life. At one point, I basically just stayed inside my house and smoked and only went out to resupply for weed and/or food. There were days when I just got up to smoke and be high. Eating was secondary, only did so when the cravings became absolutely unbearable. Was always late for everything, everyone & everywhere and I started becoming more & more lonely, lazy & lethargic and did not really try looking for jobs once I finished my postgraduate. 

Until the inevitable happened. All the while, I became more & more tolerant and I needed more & more finer weed to get the high that I used to get. Back in November, I bought 10g of the finest skunk I could find and man, that shit was good. It was so good that I only needed 3-4 puffs to get the high that I was looking for. Except that I smoked it like I was smoking a cigarette. Day & Night. Daily. For a week or a bit more. I can't remember, because it triggered my first episode of cannabis-induced psychosis. Went absolute mental. Thrashed my apartment, scared & bullied the neighbours, disappeared for days and was living in another reality, seeing and hearing and living a completely delusional reality. Woke up in a hospital and had trouble remembering what I did exactly and the timeline of it all. Doctors said my blood was saturated with cannabis/THC and that I should stay away from it for life. From what I understand, weed triggered my episode, but it was other stuff (toxic relationships) that were responsible for my condition. 

Since then, I have quit and today, I am a lil more than 6 months free. I also gave up on smoking on 1st Jan,  so that makes it around 4 months for cigs. In that time, I've been working on my physical condition, taking up fitness courses & boxing. The high you get from physical exercises kinda beats the high that I used to get from weed, but some days, you really miss it. Especially, when it's so much present around you in the form of tv & movie shows or on social media. Also, I miss it because I really liked to smoke and get high, but then, I did not have any control on it and in the end, it got the better of me. 

I was researching whether it was ""safe"" for me to ever smoke again once in a blue moon or in some years (digged into this a couple of times since I stopped) when I stumbled upon the community and reading your posts made me realise how I was not alone in this struggle & how fighting to stay sober is actually cool in a world where weed is portrayed as the ultimate solution to all the problems of this world, and especially the struggles of millenials.",5

I started smoking at 18, I’m almost 24. I haven’t had more than a few days without some form of THC, and I recently came to understand that I’m fucking addicted to what they said you couldn’t be addicted to.

I’ve told myself so many times I’d quit over the past 2 years of my life. I would say recently over the past year I’ve been even more eager to stop. But guess what? I just put in an order for another cartridge to come. Just right now. I told myself my last one would be it. I’ve gone from flower to wax pens to edibles, back to flower and now back to wax pens. I know the health risks, it’s awful. ESPECIALLY right now. But I can’t stop.

Every time I’m almost done with my supply, whatever it may be, I’m like okay this is it fam. You’re gonna quit. Then my mind downplays the fuck out of everything, like it’s okay, what else are you gonna do? It’s fine, you’re young. Don’t worry, you’ll stop after this.

People who’ve quit successfully, did you go through this? It’s almost like my mind plays games for me to want to continue. I do want to stop. I hate spending so much on weed. I just dropped $60 for a 1/2 cart! Which I can finish in a week. That’s basically a nice dinner right there. I always complain I can’t afford this, can’t afford that since I’m a student, yet I’m blowing my money on this shit.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Below is an attempt to record my current state and maybe a way of me looking to see if internet strangers can be of help:

Im a 33 y/o guy, smoker for the last 12 years. Basically last 7 years of my life has been becoming emptier and emptier and today is the night i sorta went ""well either there is something to life that i should rediscover or i probably actually will commit suicide at some point"" for the first time. I mean i thought of the concept before, even at a personal level, and dont get me wrong i wont kill myself for a loong time probably, defo not before my mom passes, but today was the first time i fully acknowledged its possibility.

Ive had the easiest possible life. Loving parents, not mad money but like i never worked as a teenager or anything, im a designer and when i was out of uni, jobs were plenty and i always had a job somewhat. (having said that currently i am in a medium size debt and no job) And i did ok with the social side and women too, well liked in friend circles and never really was a casanova but i was mostly in long lasting romantic relationships with mostly loving, happy women.

Then for the last 2 years the central issue in my life became losing the abilty to want. I dont want anything, i dont want to eat, i dont ever fantasize about a meal,  i dont wanna go on any sort of social, i literally woildnt have a smidgen of a feeling inside me if i won a free trip on a cruiseboat or whatever. Last year i met this dreamy girl, even started dating her and although all the cells in my body told me this was something nice, i found myself blocked by myself at every corner of that relationship and i proceeded to fuck it up and it crushes me but i refuse to do anything abt it, and we still talk to this day and i cant find the energy to make anything happen, this goes for work too. And life in general, like i learned a lot of shit the first 20 years so now i have some skills in a lot of art stuff but my output is zero.

Sorry for the ramble, writing this i realised i cant really express what i feel in a nuanced way... I see edits are a thing? 

Anyway, thanks for existing, i like this sub.",1

It makes me feel like I’m not crazy and like my weed addiction is “all in my head.” It’s nice to post here and just get everything out. 

This week has been okay, but I am noticing my routine starting to change. I know relapse happens before you actually pick up, and I want to avoid it. I can’t afford another relapse for my mental, financial, and physical well-being. 

I just notice myself not wanting to shower at night, or wanting to clean my bathroom, clean my room, cook my food, take care of myself, or do homework. I’m still doing it for the most part, but I have really needed to push myself to do it. For example, I didn’t shower the past two nights because I was tired (I did in the morning), but tonight I pushed myself to shower. I just don’t feel like doing anything that I have to. I also am starting to forget to take my medication.

I notice the “disease” or instant gratification wanting to come out. I notice I’ve been really feeling a need to impulsive shop. I have been trying to limit that, but it is hard. I just feel like I need that rush of dopamine, and I notice if it’s not one compulsion it becomes another. It’s difficult to not give in to instant gratification. 

I know that my father and grandmother( his mother) both have the “disease.” My grandmother is a gambling addict and suffers from depression. She never got help. My father also suffers from depression and is an alcoholic. 

My father quit smoking cigarettes almost thirty years ago. About ten years ago he started smoking cigars, and he was back on nicotine like he never stopped. He’s also an alcoholic, but never gave up the alcohol. Yesterday he smoked cigarettes for the first time in years, and for the past couple months he has been spiraling out of control. It just proved to me that the “disease” is always at bay, and it doesn’t matter how long you have been sober; as soon as you pick up the first joint, drink, needle, etcetera you will lose control.  

It also made me realize my own mental illness will always be at bay. Thankfully I have not been in a bad depression for over a year. I do have problems, but I’ve been able to manage them. I do worry about having another suicidal depression, and that’s why I need to stay away from cannabis and continue taking care of my physical well-being. 

I see the other subreddit for moderation of weed, but deep down I know I can’t handle it. It also takes way too much effort for me to moderate my marijuana use; I have not been successful. 

I guess everything will eventually be okay. I’m glad I at least had a good weekend. I’m not looking forward to work, but that’s a whole other story. 

Thanks for reading, and if I don’t respond right away I apologize in advance. As soon as Monday happens I’m on the go and don’t check in often. Hope everyone’s week goes better than mine.",2

I know it’s doing me infinitely more harm than good. Now I want to do something about it.,"I’m a 23 year old guy and was introduced to smoking about 5 years ago through a friend and his girl. This was a rough time in my life - I had fallen out with my best friend and never thought I’d see him again or that he’d want talk to me again, so was spending more and more time with this group of people. 

Fast forward to today and I am now friends with him again and have been for the past two and a half years or so. Things are now better than ever but one thing I have always tried to hide is that I smoke. He knows I do it now and again, but nowhere near the level that I am - currently, I’m spending around £20 a day on weed and while that might not sound like a lot to everyone reading this, it’s a lot to me and all adds up over the course of a month. I also feel that I am spending more money on food, takeaways, etc than I need to: all consumable shite, meaning I have nothing to show for the decent money I am earning from my job.

I’ve always been big, but I have put on so much weight through smoking and find myself not really eating throughout the day, then eating like mad at night. I don’t have any appetite if I go without smoking, obviously this passes after a few days - my issue is making it that far.

Weed is also impacting on my social life too, as obviously most of the time I’m awake I’m stoned and I don’t want him to see me stoned. Tonight, he asked to meet for a cigarette which would’ve been the first time I’d have seen him in about 6 weeks due to lockdown/ isolating. I declined...because I was stoned. I had to make an excuse. 

I feel like I am completely stuck in a rut.
I’m on decent money, but in a dead end job. 
I’m smoking from first thing in morning to last thing at night, spending around £20 a day on weed alone (excluding other things related to it, like cigarettes/ tobacco, takeaways, etc)
I am keeping secrets from my best friend because I don’t have the balls to tell him and I know he’d be disgusted if he found out. 

My mum has been very encouraging in terms of me stopping, but I really feel like I could use some advice from people in a similar situation. Please reach out via PM or reply to this. I have stopped before, started exercising, and lost weight only to start again a few months later. I need to get off this for good.

Like 3 years ago, I also developed a nicotine addiction, originally through vapes such as the juul and the suorin. I had friends that took poppers/chops and I had tried a few but never been the biggest fan. Until this past year when I started smoking cigarettes in an attempt to ween myself off the juul, and this evolved into a compulsive desire to constantly take chops as the headrush was far superior than smoking a cigarette.

Anyways, I don't even know if I fully want to quit weed, but I know that I'm sick of feeling anxious all the time and I think that this nicotine and weed reliance definitely doesn't help. I also know that my lungs will be fucked if I don't stop chopping, as after most of them I am legit out of breath. During quarantine, I've been taking like 10 chops a day going through like 5 grams of nug a week and like a pack of light blue American Spirits, but a few days ago I didn't take a single one. Yesterday I took like three at night and today I haven't done anything yet. Wtf do I do? Should I quit one at a time? Just go cold turkey from it all? My anxiety gets soooo bad like gnarly which is kind of a bitch... Thoughts?

EDIT: Was doing good and had been cold turkey from nicotine for like four days and then I got kinda drunk and sad and decided to take a chop. Threw up like immediately after and I think it's a sign. Gonna keep trying I think.",10

Don't let marijuana be the reason your life falls apart. I always had a sense, that voice in the back of my head, that wanted to convince me that I wasn't living to my full potential, I had no ""best version of myself"" in my mind. Life was all about instant gratification while high, and I was always high.

It’s passed for seven or so years, but the cracks are beginning to show.
The reasons for quitting are stacking up to a height where I can’t bargain anymore for one more year or month.

I’ve lurked on here for a while, and thank you everyone for sharing what you have. I’ve never related to anything so much.

My problem, as others on here have also described, is that the challenge isn’t just quitting, or having enough reasons to quit. I have a good fifty reasons I could list right now, and they’re still relevant reasons when I’m going through withdrawal - but every time, I tell myself, screw those reasons, I’m going to smoke anyway because everything is pain without it. I know that’s just the addiction talking, that if I stick it out for weeks and months then I will begin to enjoy life and focus on achieving my goals again. But in that moment, I don’t believe it, and I cave. Every time. 

My problem is knowing what to do with myself and how to deal with boredom and sadness without that crutch. How to shape a life that doesnt revolve around weed, but which also recognises my need for destressing and entertainment.
I’m figuring what I can do instead to relax, and it includes a lot of
* yoga
* long walks and light cardio
* meditation
* engaging my brain with the books, podcasts and study that used to thrill and drive me

I’m girding myself for some misery, but I’ve written this to remind myself that the real misery is this farcical groundhog day loop I’ve somehow turned my life into. I need to remind myself in the dark moments that life could be really fun, rewarding, pleasant and even exciting without weed. In fact, there are parts of life which I can only be rewarded in if I don’t smoke.

And hey, if I can do it, I’ll post here again about all the ways my life has improved.",62

I am realising how slow weed maked me, like fully it slows me down and I am only just starting to realise this after staying sober for only 24 hours. I have been smoking for the last 10 years since I was 12. I am not sure how to go about quitting but i am realising I have a lot more money. Like I do not know when this happened but somewhere along the way I decided I would spend all my money on weed, at one point it included other substances, but they were really never my thing, and so I threw about ten years of savings on temporary highs. Sometimes I wish I never smoked it, and I a filled with regret, but then I think like its better it happened now in a way because I don't have life savings to burn through, if that makes any sense at all. Maybe this is all a crack dream. 

I also have a lot more time. Turns out rolling and smoking many times a day takes up a lot of time... so I have a lot more time to get back into coding, video editing and writing, things that I used to do as a kid for interest, but lost sight of as I started smoking weed. I am sure my life progression has definitely taken a hit because of this, but hey I am not to concerned about that everyone has setbacks, some peoples are a choice, some are not, but whatever, mine was a choice, i gotta deal with that.

I have not slept in a while, I always used to smoke all day, and so by extent before bed, so sleeping was not really a problem, if I could not sleep, I would just smoke till I could you know, and staying up late was never really annoying. Now it is. That is the adjustment period I guess. 

Something else.... all my friends smoke weed, so I guess that has to change... that is going to be fun. This is the furthest I have gotten without smoking weed and I am starting to see what life is like on the other side, I do not remember what my personality was like without weed. I am kind of excited. Take for instance I used to be amazing at maths, and even after just one day I worked out something in my head that would have usually taken me to a calculator... 

Do not get me wrong, this is actually so hard, but the benefits outweigh the hardness of it, if, again, that makes any sense to anyone.  

This may be the greatest thing I have ever done, but I feel like it will also be one of the hardest things I have ever done at the same time. That has got to mean its worth it right? That is what I am thinking at least. 

I a gonna use this as somewhere to track my progress as I go along, see how its going, and hey, if i discover anything along the way I have not heard before, ill let you know, but yeah

Sleep is finally getting better and the foggy mind I once had is clearing out. Currently, I am a little concerned about my weight. I used to get stoned and lift, also run. Last year while using mass gainer and Torrent I reached 220lbs which is cool for a 6'4 male.

I was still in a haze but saw I was at 206ish about 2 weeks ago. I am now at week 2 and decided to step on the scale and today I am at 198, I still exercise the same amount and lift the same weight without issue. It just makes my mind race seeing such a big drop. I am pretty sure it's just this loss of appetite, seems I can fill up on less and even missed lunch a few days without noticing.

I've got to assume my lack of caloric intake is the reason as before I could eat all day being a high on. Even with this assumption, it makes me freak out.  I can't get stoned to calm down so I just need to hear some other people's thoughts.

In the discord, it was said to drink milk and oats before bed which I will be doing and appreciated that input! I just wondered if anyone else has gone through this and if they have any solutions to get that appetite back up. Again, just freaking out and looking for some comfort or advice if I should be concerned.

If you care to read what exercises I perform:

My routine is 5 days a week, I do 5 sets of 10 pull-ups, 3 sets of 12 mil press at 125lbs, a variation of incline(160) or standard bench(180) at 3x12 depending on the day, followed by 3x12 skulls at 90lbs, and 3 minutes of side planks for the left and right with a 10 lb weight above my head. I then run 5 miles between these 3 lift days.

Lately, all I can eat is like 2 eggs in the AM sometimes cottage cheese or lunch meat around noon and about half of what I usually eat for dinner serving of a protein and veggies.",2

It's a question I've been asking myself for a while now. Over the course of the last couple of years the answer changes.

""I need weed to maintain my social life.""

""I need weed to fit in with my friends.""

""I need weed to maintain my brain.""

And other various answers that I would use to justify my continued use of marijuana.


I started smoking marijuana when I was in high school casually as more of a social thing. My daily smoking really became a thing when I went to university and away from my parents.

I'm at the point of my smoking career, which I'm not sure why I smoke any more. While I think I crave it but barely feel the effects when I indulge. In a chase to try to find that super high again I explored dabs and other concentrate but to no avail. The effects of smoking are no longer present or at least very weak. 

I'm 36 now. I've been smoking almost 18 years on a daily basis. 

With COVID-19 running rampant I've been in self-isolation and was finding myself smoking a bong hit at every hour. 

But WHY? I'm not feeling the effects. I've smoked myself so silly that it's silly to keep continuing on this path of wasting my money and my life. 

So with that I'm currently on Day 3 of sobriety. It's been difficult but my mind is made. There is nothing left for me to gain with marijuana. I've run out of excuses.

It’s the best job I’ve ever had, I love the people I work with and the work I do.  Lately I’ve been contemplating sobriety but it is really challenging to take that step when my livelihood is so centered in the world of cannabis as savior. I’ve been an on/off marijuana user for about 7 years.  Since becoming a legally registered patient and now working for a business that supports my use, the stretches of “on” time have become longer.  Throughout the years I’ve gone through several phases of deciding I should take a break.  Usually those breaks last a few months and then I’m back at it like we’re old friends.  At this point I’ve been consuming in some way, whether it be smoking or edibles, every day for a whole year.

I have a qualifying medical condition so when I debate it in my head, I’m often justifying my use because I do believe it benefits me in a big way.  But on the flip side, I also see how it doesn’t.  On my days off, I am smoking the entire day.  Sometimes I stay productive, but just as often I don’t.  I eat worse than I could be, but I also stay smart enough to eat enough vegetables  to offset the junk.  I guess what’s mostly bothering me is just that before I do anything now, I have to smoke or the task feels terribly boring.  Working out? Smoke first.  Cooking a meal?  Smoke first.  Taking a shower?  Smoke first.  I wonder so often if it’s really that healthy for my brain to receive constant manual adjustment.  And consistently over long stretches of time.  I don’t feel dumber or slower.  In fact, I have received promotions, I keep a clean house, I’m generally a nice person.

Overall, I feel like I’m moderating my lifestyle well enough, but I keep feeling somewhat unsettled that I “need” to take a mind altering substance daily to make my days bearable?  My medical condition is not really debilitating.  I could survive without any medication, but should I have to when relief is available?

1. I’ve saved a lot of money in these 2+ months of being weed free that I was able to get my mom a really nice birthday and Mother’s Day gift. I’m also planning a vacation in the summer with friends because I no longer blow my money on weed and now I can spend it on memories! 

2. I started online school this past week and I killed the first weeks assignments! They were fairly easy but one was a pretty in-depth comparison of Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. My brain was working in a way I haven’t felt in regards to homework in years! 

3. Work has been better with less brain fog. I’m getting my projects done and I really want to go above and beyond for personal reasons. 

4. I haven’t done it yet but I’m feeling very optimistic about being more active starting this week. I want to start doing Yoga before I workout so I can stretch more. I’m also planning on returning to the golf range this week to improve my game.

None of this would be possible if I didn’t put down the weed and give myself time to heal. I still have a LONG journey ahead and a lot more to accomplish. But it’s been a good week and I have to keep it up and keep pushing. Good luck to everyone else on here!",9

It was a reference to M3rkMus1c's fake altered ego on youtube)","I'm 18 and have been getting high off of dab carts and edibles, every day for the past two months since school closed because of the coronavirus. I worked at the movies and they too are closed. So every day I sit at home being bored and self isolating. So to pass the time I would get high at around noon. Sober up at around 4 p.m, and around 6 p.m I'd spend the rest of the night getting higher and higher of off my dab pen and or edibles until I was so tired and high I'd pass out in bed (yeah I know, sad). Before these two months I'd get high once a night for a couple of years I only used a dab pen.

Day 1: Insomnia. Tried to go to bed but couldn't sleep too well.

Day 2: woke up damp and hot. With cold sweats through the day. literally had zero appetite the entire day. Only ate once, 2/3 of a Chunky brand soup after being awake for 10 hours. I forced myself to eat the soup because I knew that I needed to eat even though I wasn't hungry. I was slightly antsy and more irritable towards my friends and family. I feel depressed.

Day 3: I'll wake up and my entire body is damp. My hair included. I have constant cold sweats (my nose is always damp). Severe stomach gas with belching and the occasional acid reflux. My mind feels shot in a way. My appetite is still gone. Everyting is a struggle for me. Trying to sleep is impossible, hands are shaking slightly, no appetite yet my stomach has hunger pains. I feel really depressed.

Day 4: woke up all hot and damp as usual. This time however the mid to lower half of my sternum was in severe tender pain. Lasted for only 15 minutes. Can't tell if it's a PAWS or if my inflamed cartilage medical condition was acting up in pain because I stopped consuming copious amounts of thc. Don't feel as depressed as day 3.

The funny thing to me is that if I wanted to include everything from those 4 days then I'd need to write an essay but my finger coordination isn't the best at the moment and trying to think really had takes a toll on me. Going from being high for the majority of being awake to nothing is so hard. My mind is in shambles and and along with that is my physical self. From all of the symptoms I listed the one that is almost crippling at times is my mental health. My mind is taking the Withdrawls the worst.

**-William Makepeace Thackeray**

Today is the first mothers day, since my Mum's passing. In spending the day reminiscing, I really wonder how long it will take, until i start feeling ""too much"" and go looking go looking for the artificial warmth and numbness, provided by weed.

In theory, I know its a bad idea. and have no interest in that at all. In reality...well the day has just started, so its too early to tell. Guess it shouldnt be a problem... but to make things more stressful, the friend i saw on day 10 is in town to see his mother,  and wants to hang out. In itself, this isnt such a bad thing. The trouble starts, when he said he wants to bring that drunktard of an idiot with him.

I can already see where this goes. ""I quit drinking"" but 5 minutes into his visit he will have a bottle in his hands, I will kick him out, actual friend will leave, to take him home, and I will want to smoke.

Ah well. I guess its moments like these i need to practise for. Back to sleep for an hour or so, until first group.

I have had a few breaks in the past 22 years, a year off during my pregnancy and breastfeeding was the most significant, other breaks were under a week and usually caused by not being able to source any.

I am so tired of being a pothead, I feel constantly body exhausted, my words always get jumbled up when speaking, it takes me longer to process information, I have no motivation to do anything beyond the bare minimum. I really want a social life and friends which is difficult when I'm rushing to get home to have a spliff. There are so many reasons why I do not enjoy smoking and have wanted to quit for the last few years.

Today is Mothers day here in Australia and my gift to myself was starting day 1. I've just done 24 hours because I chose to stop. I've thought about smoking all day, and I know the hardest days are yet to come but I'm proud of myself. 

My timing isn't the best, really it couldn't be a worse time. I am single for the first time since I was 18, I work full time in a emotionally draining job (currently from home) and I am also homeschooling my 7 year old twins. But that's on me for waiting until there's a pandemic before finally getting to this point. I wish I did this year's ago and i feel like so many years have been wasted. 

I have lurked here for the last year, reading everyone's different experiences has played a huge part in me getting to this day,  particularly reading the long term smokers and how much better life is without pot. I started thinking if they can do it why can't I? 

Thankyou to everyone that shares, it does make a difference. 

So here I am, day 1 done and ready to start living again 😀",6

Sure, the first couple hours were fun. We were laughing and being silly. But then I started eating, and kept smoking, and then I'm sinking into the couch. After 6 hours of stupid TV and eating almost an entire carrot cake to myself I felt disgusting. It wasn't fun anymore. I was right back to where I was before I quit. 

I'm so angry today. I'm so sad and disgusted. I'm still full from all that food, I'm going to be sad and depressed for 3 days at least now, my brain chemistry is completely fucked again. There go my plans to be productive today. I feel like a bag of shit. 

I want to blame my boyfriend, he likes smoking once in a while and play video games. But he doesn't have the same problem as me. This is entirely my fault. Just because he wants to smoke doesn't mean I have to. 

I'm writing this down to remember this feeling the next time I think that smoking once won't be bad. The ironic thing is, I told myself yesterday that I could smoke as long as I only smoked the one day. That this wasn't going to turn into a week of smoking weed everyday. 

Now here I am. There's no way that I'm going to keep smoking today. I have no fucking desire to do so at all. Silver lining is that I know now that that isn't the problem. I can't smoke at all.

About 2 weeks ago I smoked my last spliff and am hoping this time I can make it stick. I've been smoking since I was about 14/15 and am now 30, I've tried many times to quit but always end up slipping back into it and then feeling terrible. It ruins my life time and time again. I am a solo mother and my smoking habits during this quarantine have made me feel absolutely horrible and just tired of being an inconsistent mother and at times emotionally unavailable for my children and I'm tired of letting them down! I am really quite ashamed of myself. I have slipped into a major depression from the virus/isolation/smoking everyday and am trying to look for that light at the end of the tunnel. I have quit many times before so as hard as the cold turkey thing can be I'm doing ok with that.. but what I'm really struggling with is coming to terms with the people I have to let go of if I really want to make this last. I don't have many friends to begin with and out of them only one doesn't smoke, she is also a mother and has a husband and we don't get to spend much time together (love her to pieces though and am grateful for her). I've had to end my relationship with my boyfriend who also smokes and I came to the realization that weed is the most important thing in his life, it definitely took place over his relationship with me and I think even his daughter. It's hard to say goodbye to someone you love but our relationship has been failing for a while and all our problems stem from the emotional/psychological impacts of daily smoking. But this isn't about him, as his addiction is his journey and his alone to walk and I can only be responsible for myself. (we do not share any children together jsut to clarify any confusion) I am firm on ending the relationship with him and even a few of my friendships because I am not strong enough to resist smoking with them. So just trying to reach out to other people who are also quitting/sober so I don't feel so alone with this all!

It’s a lot more mellow and especially with corona, being unemployed, moving home, I find that I’m just pretty underwhelmed. I’m grateful to be sober, don’t get me wrong, but I think weed is sort of treated as being a placeholder for the problems in life.

Day 3. Work really sucked today, and if my stomach wasn't hurting, my mind was. That alternated each hour as I somnambulated my way through talking with coworkers and cooking orders. Got home and worked on recording a song I am going to send to mom tomorrow. Got the day off tomorrow, thinking about taking a ride on my bike to the shooting range and then watching the wwe ppv.

To be quite honest, I don't want to stop. I start graduate school soon though. It is a health professions program, so they can drug test at random. 

But, also a factor, I am terrified of repeating my undergraduate years which I just finished. Graduated a week ago w a 3.5 in biochemistry, but I'll be damned if I remember anything of note. That really sucks to say. I'm kind of a dumbass for that. While I can't honestly say I would've spent the time studying instead of smoking, there are many other aspects to college I feel I missed out on.

My roommate sells, but he is out of town atm. I am afraid that I'll relapse when he returns. We had planned on stopping together after 4/20, but that lasted about two days lol. This time I'm on my own. My last therapy appointment (student insurance ran out) was on monday.

More than anything, I want to feel integrated with the world again. Or at least to other people. I've retreated deeper into my mind over these past years; that may just be a product of age-appropriate soul-searching. Still, I feel as though I stunted my social growth by obliterating my capacity to have a ""normal"" interaction on a nightly basis. I didn't leave the house after school unless i was baked, on my way to go get baked, or had a pen on me. Ouch, that hurt to type out.

My gf of a year and I broke up in March (right before quarantine lol), and, thinking about it, I can't remember shit from November onwards. I was going through an 8th every other day. There's no way in hell I was being a good partner during that time. The ""official"" reason was mutual lack of desire to do long distance, but with time to reflect, I think my weed habit played a distinct role.

When our relationship began, I unconsciously tapered off. Hanging out felt very organic and we bonded quickly. Didn't feel the need to smoke. At some point, I decided to reintroduce weed. It was great, duh, we spent entire days pigging out, watching avatar, and having sex. Neat! Until it wasn't. We ate some edibles, she threw up and had an anxiety attack. I was too thrown to really be of much assistance or support. She stopped smoking after that, but didnt mind if I wanted to. I should've stopped then. Not because I think we'd still be dating; we wouldn't, but because I would've been able to hold onto a memory with her that wasn't prefaced by ripping a bong...

Previously I smoked heavily for 16 years. I live in a townhome so I have adjacent walls with neighbors on both sides. When I smoked, I smoked outside 99% of the time. I’m not gonna lie, if it was super cold and snowing, or raining awful I smoked inside sometimes. A lot of the time though I would just add extra layers on, use an umbrella or go for a drive. I’ve lived here for 4 years. Anyway we’ve been home due to the Rona for awhile now. My neighbors who never really smoked before have been smoking some pretty potent weed 2-4 times a day. I can no longer stand the smell of it. It’s absolutely awful. They smoke inside and it comes through the vents and stinks up my home. I was taking a nap the other day (I have a chronic illness, so I was in a lot of pain) and was woken up by them playing their music ungodly loud and vibrating my walls. I admit I was super cranky and my inner Karen came out. I emailed the property manager and told her about the music and the weed. They’ve been more considerate about the music and stopped smoking weed for 1 whole day. Yesterday I went to take a shower and during my entire shower I could smell them smoking. Obviously they were smoking in the bathroom trying to use the vent to help the smell. Guess what guys, it doesn’t help at all. I didn’t even feel clean after my shower because the smell was just awful. It’s so bad that it’s part of the reason we are not resigning the lease and are searching for a single family home to rent. It’s definitely not the only reason though. (crime rate going up, 2 police involved shootings killing 2 suspects within 8 hours of each other. Yes it’s probably the one you’ve heard about this week) 
I feel like an old, grumpy Karen. Lol I’m 36(f). Honestly if they would smoke outside like I did, I never would have reported them. It’s still illegal here, but if you’re outside you aren’t really bothering me. I can shut my window until you’re done if needed. I never really realized how awful it smelled when I did smoke! I feel like a hypocrite but damnit please just go outside and smoke! Stop stinking up my home! 
Anyway, thanks for letting me vent! I’m not going to report them again because really all they will do is call them and say you’re neighbors can smell you smoking weed, shame on you. They don’t do anything about it.",0

This clarity is insane, I feel boundless rage, but its good. Rage is... substance, its energy. Anger shows me where i've came from and where im going. And this anger can be converted. I can workout and get fit. I can thrive and push myself.

Weed is great in the sense that it it stopped me seeing this rage, but never again can I afford to forget my anger, I need to accept who I am, and not hide from it. My anger doesnt define me, how I use it does.

And sure I got angry while stoned sometimes but that was foggy anger, undirected, bottled and simmering with no escape, route or cause. Its time for me to grow up and confront my issues.",197

I remember the first time I actually got high, I couldn't stop giggling and I kept on looking at cool pictures on Tumblr and eating Animal Crackers. What started out as once every few months eventually turned into smoking multiple times a day for 6 years straight. When I think about the past 6 years, it's impossible to not think I wasted so much of the prime of my life. So much time and money wasted on a plant. The reason I loved getting high was that it was like a comfy fog - I wasn't anxious, I wasn't worried about all of the things I should be doing, I wasn't concerned with my self esteem issues. What I realize now though is that the person who I think I am and who I believe myself to be is drastically different than how I actually live my life. I want to be in shape. I want to eat healthy. I want to crush it at my job. I want to get a beautiful girlfriend who loves me. I want to have hobbies. I want to travel. I want to live. I'm tired of procrastinating my life away and weed definitely contributed to that. I think it is easy for me to blame all of my problems on weed, but in reality, the problems have always been there. Weed just became the scapegoat that I could blame all my failures on and allowed me to never face my problems head on. It's time to change that. Cheers to the start of my weed free journey. I've thrown away my grinder and bowl for what feels like the 10th time. I'm out of weed. I will journal to track my growth. I will attend an MA meeting to see if that clicks with me. I really want to be clean and I want to be happy. I am grateful for this Reddit community to be able to look at advice and success stories from people just like myself. I am ready to LIVE.",10

In short: I've been able to live a truly blessed life even as a stoner. Great partner, good work, travel the world, and lucky with good habits like yoga and meditation. However, I've been enslaved to weed, not really living my potential, emotional instability, and over the past 3 years when I've been lucky to work remotely, my weed consumption went WAY up (smoking almost every morning).

Quitting has been hell-ish until today. NO energy, motivation, less focused, depressed, grumpy, intense cravings. Have just felt like it was impossible and there's been no benefits.

Today, I forced myself to meditate and do some exercise and felt myself starting to feel bright again, in a clearer, happier way. Still feel the urge to smoke (especially on weekends), but am feeling so grateful for these forums, words of support.

I wrote two days ago about intense lethargy and it's starting to lift. Anyhow, I might not be through the hardest part yet, but if you're in some of the weeds of the hell-ish withdrawl part, keep going. I am feeling it not only get easier, but rewarding.

Personal growth of anytime doesn't happen in our comfort zones, and for those not addicted to weed, probably don't realize what a real challenge this is. I'm actually feeling kind of proud of myself.

Also, meditation is crucial. Really, it made a world of different (I let it slip for the first few weeks because I was feeling so depressed). If you've never tried it, now is the perfect time and it's lifechanging.

Keep up the great work.  Also curious when people began to feel real big breakthroughs themselves.",7

Does anyone have nightmares about smoking again?? 

My nightmares will consist of me smoking and then feeling like absolute SHIT for letting myself smoke again. Just pure disappointment. Words can’t describe how down I feel. 

It’s so realistic that I wake up thinking I actually did smoke before bed. Holy fuck, I get so disappointed in myself. That is, until I realize it was just a nightmare. 

My worst urges so far came about 1.5-2 weeks in (2.5 in rn) and these nightmares have honestly helped me from not smoking again. Being able to associate smoking with these nightmares has actually been really good for me.

 I sleep about 4 feet from my stash and I think being able to resist the urge to grab my easily accessible pen is a huge step towards helping me grow.

I've realized what weed has done to me.,"I'm 34 and have been smoking essentially non-stop since fourteen. All day smoker for at the very least ten years. For a long time I've been aware that I abuse the substance far too much. I've spent who knows how many thousands of dollars on it over the years...I'm also fully aware I don't feel like doing anything unless I've got a bake on. I've tried to quit many times...more, told myself I would try and failed miserably.. it's seems like once I sober up the thought of quitting is laughable. However, sometimes by the end of the day I'm smoking massive bong loads of prime weed just for a slight buzz increase that lasts what, 10 minutes??? Maybe?
Anyway..at one point I was actually without product for just over two weeks because of this covid business. That's the longest I've gone in as long as I remember.. it was odd...I truly had no motivation and I couldn't wait to get my hands on some weed.  
Finally I buckled and bought some weed offline, which I've never done....well....I wasn't disappointed...my first time got me baaakeed. I instantly thought ""ahhhhhh perfect. Let's sculpt, let's play some vids, do some drawing - and I did.
Then I felt anxious and I simply couldnt shake how bad I felt for those two weeks...well...god it's so hard to describe..not BAD, just no motivation what. so. ever. All I really did was sit...and scroll through what was on Netflix, rarely feeling intrigued to watch anything. After pragmatically understanding that what I've been doing is out of control - it didn't really slap me in the face until all this happened.

Now I knowi have to stop.   I'm honestly frightened. I've torn myself up reflecting on how I've wasted so much time faffing around, not paying as close attention to my post secondary education - that's gone no where... And simply thinking about all the times I've likely missed something memorable because I'm too busy packing a bong load.  
I know the road travelled is different for everyone but in my case, I've watched virtually everyone I know grow up and move farther ahead in life than myself. 


It's something I love sooo much that I really don't want to let go bit I know in my heàrt I have to. I would be a very different version of myself if I hadn't spent the last two decades chasing a weed high.

I stumbled across you guys last night and these posts are so inspiring...I'm going to keep a close eye on this sub and will likely reach out more in the future.

I am not going to say coming off weed is more dangerous than other withdrawals (which can be deadly). But I had a way harder time than even coming off heavy antidepressants in the past. My symptoms were intense, physical, and crippling for days.

All of your stories are what keep me motivated to stay in this journey of quitting weed.

I know 3 days is not a lot, but believe me, for me it is!
(Mostly because I recently harvested a few plants so I have a lot of high quality weed at the reach of my hand and I am in lockdown homealone)
I was a little bit scared reading the withdrawal effects (nightmares, anxiety, cravings, etc)
But surprisingly it's been easier than what I thought so far. Yes I have some insomnia and vivid dreams, but no nightmares for now, and my anxiety is in the lowest level I can remember being for many many years.

Should I expect more withdrawal effects in the next days ? What was your experience ? I know every case is different but I thought the first days should be the hardest, and I haven't experienced REAL cravings so far.

I will share to you my technique, maybe is useful for someone. Apart from being really convinced of quitting, and apart from reading this sub when I feel I need some motivation, what helped me A LOT is using lignum vitae (or any incense is ok) this kind of replace the ritual of lighting something up that releases smoke and smell.

For me, today marks 1 year since I last toked. I have one year free from weed and 100 something days from alcohol and all other drugs.  Weed was my drug of choice but unfortunately for someone like me, I tend to get a little too excited about other substances in its absence so I've cut off everything.

Maybe in time that will change but for today I've never felt better being clean.

I spent a decade smoking obsessively and all it really was in the end, was a giant waste of time. I was a pretty hardcore smoker, but I did it before those carts and stuff came on the market though my friends and I sure did dabs and stuff with a blow torch rig when we could get grams of oil. 

What I've learned during my time in sobriety is that drugs do not make me happy, people make me happy. I am not as much of an isolator as I thought. Connections with people make me happy. It is through those relationships that I find true happiness. 

I used to use 1-2oz a month and thought I could never quit. I've learned a lot of ways not to quit.

What works for me is hanging out with other sober people. I love going to my weekly MA meeting (though I also attend other 12 step fellowship). During those meetings I can see that I'm not alone. I can help other people and by doing that, they help me. We do it together.

I am honest. Honest with myself first and then honest with others. Honesty and fellowship.

Started at 15, I remember the first hit from a ""lung"" i bought for 50 pence (2 litre plastic bottle with a shopping bag taped on to pull it). I fell instantly in love, like something connected in my brain that i'd been missing. I didnt want the feeling to end. And so I set about to make sure it never did. Even though I could feel it slowing my brain through college, even though it got in the way of every relationship, even though it destroyed my social skills. I loved the insight it offered, the creative buzz and the ritual.

I kinda drifted through my 20s, got fired from jobs, went freelance, did the bare minimum. But i was making music and getting off on playing in bands. My 30s came and I moved into a warehouse. A great, creative space where I made a lot of art, but thats when the wake and bake started. In my own space ""working"" from home I had no reason not to. I'd avoid phone calls (the devil), future planning terrified me, if I did go out I wouldnt really speak to anyone. I used to have a personality but I replaced it by living in a bubble. The usage kept increasing until the last two years which have been very heavy with weed, getting up at midday, smoking all day, falling asleep around 7pm, waking up at 11pm smoking some more then going back to bed. I felt like a rat in a cage constantly pressing that dopamine button.

I'm 36 now and single living in a mouldy flat with a heroin addict. This pandemic has showed my that my life isnt exactly how I wanted it to be! It's funny i've tried every drug you could name, but I've never had addiction problems apart from the green. I guess some people are wired to really buzz off the stuff. I can have a bottle of whiskey in my room for weeks without touching it, but even a crumb of weed and it'll be gone in seconds.

So this is the time I'm going to quit for good, although I don't really believe myself. I'm still in love. Weed has been the best girlfriend I've ever had, but also the worst and the most needy. This is perhaps the 6th attempt this year. It s too easy to relapse, I have a fetishised romantic vision in my head of it (even the way this post reads will tell you as much). I think I cant be creative without it, that I will lose who I am if I dont smoke it. Its scary becoming a new person when you are middle aged. The thought keeps popping up that I'll be different this time, that I can just have one joint a day like a sensible person, but I know its a lie and the binging will instantly start up again. But its a lovely day and I want to listen to Miles Davis in the park with a fat zoot!! I think addicts will always be addicts.

BUT... goodbye my love! I've found a new hobby in running, its an amazing natural high. I'm going to get my shit together, run off all that cookie dough around my midrift, get a girlfriend, read some fucking books. The unknown scares me, but as Oliver Tremor Control sing ""theres no growing in knowing where you're going"".  But I'll always miss you and the times we had in the glory years when we ran the damn city in my head. xx",5

Find myself missing weed, craving it more and more. but between trying to stay fit (carrying and chopping 20 logs a day, running as soon as my shoes arrive) and trying to clean up the mess from neglect (high, dont care, things deteriorate) i just dont have the time or energy to smoke.

That said, I set up my hookah by the bed. (It was a gift, from egypt by way of Iran. Not a cheap headshop hookah) Some worry that it will be a gateway back to weed, but I have never once equated it with weed, nor would I use a hookah for weed. so at night i may enjoy the fragrance of the shisha, before falling asleep.

Yes... I basically turned it into a $400 incense burner.

Today... I will mop my carpet downstairs... which should be... interesting, but needs to be done. I brought my cat back with me, and for the last.... way too long... Spacey and Ruth, who I left behind with mom, (Named after Ruth from The Blood Opera Sequence, Book Two, Personal Darkness, By Tanith Lee) have been fighting over territory, and turned a corner of the room i put the bed in into a litter box.

So you’ve decided you wanna quit smoking weed. Maybe you’ve been thinking about it for a while and you’re yet to make the change. Maybe you’ve started quitting already and it’s early days. Or maybe you’ve tried and failed multiple times and are just finding it too easy to get back to smoking that shit and going back to square one. This has ended up kinda long but I’ve tried to keep it readable. Besides, spending a few minutes making the effort even if you don’t feel like it at the beginning might be the kind of thing you can apply in your attempt to quit weed for good (more on that later).

&#x200B;

Some background (bear with me). I personally tried and failed a few times; I went about 6 weeks during one effort. There was a week here, a day or two there. I always seemed to go back to it at some point, but I wanted to quit and I didn’t like the way my life was with weed being a constant part of it: During my days of “peak usage”, and even at minimal usage to be honest, it’d be stuff like choosing to smoke after work instead of building new skills, being too stoned to cook so ordering shitty expensive takeaways or avoiding eating altogether, doing the bare minimum in terms of household tasks, wanting to watch a movie/play a video game high, but as soon as I was high I couldn’t even be bothered to choose a film or start up a game; I’d just sit in front of youtube consuming short form videos at the press of a button as it got later into the night and the videos got progressively more useless. Being too lazy to brush my teeth before bed, pissing in a bottle sometimes instead of leaving my room to walk across the landing and use the toilet at night, being unreliable, disorganised, life admin tasks building up around me, putting off social engagements because I’d rather be in my little stoned bubble. It was disgusting. Pathetic.

&#x200B;

I was 33 when I began my most recent effort to quit, and weed had been a part of my life to varying degrees since I was around 17. For a while there it was great. Smoking after work with friends and laughing until it hurt, smoking alone and having all my activities enhanced and just… better. I moved in with some friends and we all smoked every night, played games and just had a great time. I was in my twenties now and weed was just the best. Things were  fun and weed made it even more so. I moved in with a girl and my usage dipped. It was still in my life once or twice a week, but I smoked less (I was never a daytime, wake and bake kind of guy anyway. I’d do it occasionally but always felt a bit dirty being stoned and still having the day ahead of me. I guess I always had some kind of standard about what my lifestyle ought to be). Still, I was getting older - mid to late twenties at this point - and still wasting my time after work and not really making any life progress. I’d sleep in late, play video games, watch movies. My girlfriend was the opposite. The inevitable happened, I moved into a place on my own. It was a dark time and weed came back to comfort me. I decided to go self employed at the time too. Let me tell you, weed and depression do not make a good combination if you gotta be switched on enough to start a business. It was the worst, most shameful period of my life.

&#x200B;

So, after a few more years of being at rock bottom in every aspect of my life, seeing how my friends had transformed over the years from outgoing guys to introverted stoners (they still are to some degree. One of them now lives with me and his weed use is at an all time high) my mindset began to change and I started thinking seriously about how to get my shit together. 

&#x200B;

At this point I’ll offer you what I believe to be an important piece of advice: **Quitting weed will not solve your problems**. **But it will remove the obstacle that’s blocking your chances of solving them**. You land on the beaches of Normandy and start strutting around like the job is done, you're gonna get mown down. You gotta keep moving forward if you're gonna win the war. 

&#x200B;

I’ll also say this: I don’t believe I was addicted to weed. I was addicted to the short term dopamine rush I'd get when I finally sat down to smoke and enjoy short term, shitty rewards in the form of youtube videos, porn, junk food etc. Try rolling a joint and then just not smoking it for a while. It’s not so hard because you know it’s there whenever you want to light it up. Smoking that joint? It’s wonderful. As soon as it’s finished? Boring. Oh well, better roll another. It’s not being stoned that’s fun; it’s *getting* stoned (not counting the early days when you start smoking weed). In fact, if you’re reading this you’re probably at that point where being stoned makes you feel like shit every night as you try to mask the state of your situation. So no, I don’t believe I was addicted to weed. I was addicted to that life of short term dopamine and zero effort, which leads me to what I consider the “secret” to quitting weed, and to a better life than your current one:

&#x200B;

**Discipline**. **The way to stop smoking is to not smoke**. The way I did that is via not being soft and going right back to smoking the minute it started getting hard. If I really wanted to quit and better my situation then that’s what I had to do, no two ways about it. **Nothing worth doing is easy**. The hard times will last a week or two - nothing in the grand scheme of things. But it might feel like everything at the time because you’ve conditioned yourself as a stoner to avoid any kind of real effort. **The weed life is the easy life, the easy life is the shit life**. Expect sleepless nights, vivid dreams, nightmares, a feeling called boredom you might not have felt for some time. The feeling of having nothing to do. Except that’s isn't true. Start using that feeling to do something else. Get up, sort your paperwork, tidy your house, do the dishes, brush your teeth, start a project, pick up a project you left hanging, start some tutorials on something. These amazing feats of productivity are what regular people call real life, something I had been numbing myself to all this time while I polluted my brain with weed. And the more you do these tasks, the more they become normal. So you start picking up new ones bit by bit. They snowball. I’m sure you might find it easy to play an RPG; start a character from nothing, grind along the way, keep levelling up, completing repetitive quests for that sweet reward, getting better and more powerful along the way - as humans that’s what we do to make us happy, but you gotta apply it to your own life.

&#x200B;

One of my favourite motivational guys, David Goggins, calls it callusing the mind. The more hard shit you do, the stronger your mind becomes and the easier those things become. Back then I was soft. I had to become hard. As humans we’re supposed to do shit. We do a task to some degree of difficulty, we complete that task, we feel good about it. The harder the task, the bigger the reward when it’s complete. You even get a reward for pursuing the task in the first place and actively making progress. It’s keeping on top of these tasks and objectives, following some form of path, that gives us a feeling that some might call happiness.

&#x200B;

But back to the weed. I wasn't doing shit until it was gone. It’s a plant. I was destroying my life by smoking a plant. It had to stop. You can make quitting easier for yourself by tapering off for a while. That’s exactly what I did. I smoked one joint a night for around a few weeks before my most recent attempt to quit. And I’d smoke it right before bed. I’d get all my shit done using discipline, reward myself with the joint. But a joint every night is still weed every night which meant weed in my system holding me back, so it had to go.

&#x200B;

I stopped smoking one year ago today and I’ve never looked back. I don’t miss it at all. I live with a stoner; my friends are stoners. The phrase “high on life” always seemed like bullshit to me but it’s accurate. There was a time when watching a movie without weed would have seemed so boring, so vanilla, but I don’t notice it now. Ever watched a film baked, felt like you were completely immersed, then barely remember watching it the next day? I’m 100% dialled in to everything via a combination of zero weed, and effort to keep the plates that are my life spinning. And I’m far from a success, by the way. But I get out of bed with no grogginess, I arrive to work early, I brush my teeth every night without fail, I pay my bills early, I add to/tick things off of my Google Keep to-do list every night, I work out 3 days a week right after work, I sit at my computer after work and build my skillset, I tick that off my Loop Habit Tracker app every day along with “Don’t Smoke Weed” that I added on there exactly a year ago today. I keep on top of household tasks, I don’t nap anymore, I sleep about 8 hours a night of real, good quality sleep with real dreams, I wake up early even on my days off. I look and feel better than I have for years. I’m responsible and I’m organised. I’ve just sat down and typed this out a few days before I posted it as it was on my to-do list and I wanted to have it typed up ready for today.

&#x200B;

Anyway, It won’t be easy but nothing worth doing is. The weed life is the easy life, the easy life is the shit life. Stay Hard, as my man Goggins would say.",292

In my entire adult life, if there is a single smart thing that I did, it was to save up and buy myself a bed and mattress.

For the last 6 months, Since my mothers funeral, I have been sleeping on either a cot or hideabed with exposed coil, with 2 dogs and a cat. You may imagine, it was horrible. But, i was too tired and high to care.

So, after 2 weeks of sobriety, waking up stiff and super irritable, drove up to the capitol, (I know its capital, but I literally lived next door to the capitol) and got my mattress.... Man, I can't wait to sleep.

Reason for not smoking #3775487

Went to town for a moment this evening, and coming home, turned around a curve (going less than the limit, because its half blind) and there was a fucking family walking up the middle of my lane, with their daughter on a trike, in front of them.

If I had smoked, AT ALL in the past 3 days, there is NO way I would have missed them, and would be in jail right now. As it is, I was barely able to swerve into the other lane, and thank $deity there was no oncoming traffic. Just HOLY FUCK.

Despite what I said 2 paragraphs ago... There will be NO sleep had.

Back to the bed thing... When I came back to this town, I tried to 'help' my alcoholic idiot of a friend back to sobriety. (now, Im sober, he's still a drunk idiot who I miss, but refuse to talk to) That kinda backfired and turned into me almost permanently going back to drinking (me + alcohol = me hurt 99% of the time), and after breaking both hands - relapsing to weed for another 5.5 months... But I digress.

One night, I mentioned that I missed my bed, and seemed absolutely incredulous that I would have a bed, let alone a queen. It was at that moment, I knew, that i couldnt talk to him anymore, his reaction to needing (not wanting) a large  bed, because two (or more... long story bad life choices 4684) people shared it, with pets was just... I can't even put words to it... other than, utterly revolting. ... that I wanted to hurt him... the utter contempt he held at sharing yourself with someone so completely, if only temporarily, to sleep comfortably next to them..... Made me remember what I never ever wanted to be like... And I havent had a drink since that night.

I just wish seeing people throw away their lives on weed made me feel the same way back then. Would have skipped the last relapse and be at 3 months right now 🤔

Dont resent or hate him... just, we have different lives, and I have no intention of returning to that white-trash-cesspool-of-a-lifestyle ever again. The big problem is though, after not smoking 16 days... I have the urge to be around humans... and in this town, he's kinda the only option. (reason #478 for staying in this town vs going back to the capitol, was to distance myself from negative influences, who smoked and drank, or worse, every day)

On the way to the cap and back, My dad and were in the truck together, which was... nice. Its not like we talked about anything heavy, or at all at times... but it was nice. Something that never would have happened at all if i was still smoking.",8

I have been smoking for 5 years with certain people whom I always considered my friends. Now that I am about to be done with college and will be back in town while starting a full-time job, I am aware that I cannot be dependent on weed anymore, which has led me to being 7 weeks sober as I type this. I don't know what to do about my friends. I have started taking parts of the CPA exam recently and it has completely altered my perspective on things and now I really just want to be around confident people who have passions beyond the simple stuff that is easy.

Am I rude for being distant with these people lately? I don't have bad intentions for others I just want to invest in myself and be around those who increase my self-esteem. Yet I often doubt myself and feel as though I am being overkill by burning these bridges.

I have made it known to them that I don't want to smoke as much anymore but I honestly don't see what else we can do together besides smoke and play video games.  I guess I am just waking up to the reality of this world we live in. If you took the time to read this I genuinely thank you and ask for your thoughts.

My freshman year, my grandfather passed away and since then I can’t remember a time when I didn’t use marijuana to cope.

For the last 2 years I have smoked nearly every single day, at least 2 times a day. I also suffer from anxiety and depression and I feel that the combination of these things might make quitting a bit more difficult. I’m mainly looking for a community to support me during this time seeing as I’m too embarrassed by my habits to bring this up to my friends. My family has no idea (or at least I think they don’t) but I know I won’t succeed unless I have a community to talk about my struggles with. 

I’ve tried to quit several times and each time I have gone right back to it. I’m almost out of my current supply, and I have already decided that I’m not going to buy anymore after I run out. I don’t know how long this will last, but hopefully quitting cold turkey doesn’t screw me over.

Every person, at some point in their life, will come to realization there's no growth in comfort. How old you are when you reach that point is completely up to you. This is an essay, reflecting on how I stayed in the same place in life because of my smoking habit.

Weed is so weird man. I think it affects everyone so differently. For me, weed possesses absolutely ZERO short-term flaws. I embraced early that you literally cannot die from it. There has never been a death from blood toxicity of cannibinoids. Trust me, I’ve tried many times. I still consider this to be one of the best attributes of the drug. It’s absolutetly safe in this respect. However, this fact also has a very dark side to it – you can smoke weed all day every day and still survive. If I had consumed any other substance with the frequency and quantity that I smoked weed, I’d be fucking dead. Full stop. I would’ve been viewed as an addict, I would have profound health problems, and would be a total degenerate by any reasonable person’s standard. But because I smoked weed I wasn’t an addict! I was a stoner; a non-comformist; I lived my life as I saw fit. I could smoke relentlessly and have no incredibly negative consequence. And I’m the sort of person that needs consequences. The damage it did to me happened slowly over years and I've been mostly too high to notice it. I believed because I graduated university, never got arrested, or have any health/mental problems that I was keeping it together. I was surviving. But I wasn’t truly living. I fell pray to the weed’s subtle seduction, and faced it’s curelest trick. It doesn’t kill you but it still takes your life. Now, don’t get me wrong, it’s definitely preferable to be alive than to die by overdose. But it’s sadder in it’s own way to live in stagnation than to truly live. The danger is how it makes you extremely comfortable in your current reality. Weed has always been a coping method for me. The coping mechanisms was so powerful that my goal was to design my lifestyle so that I could freely dive into the weed habit of my dreams (safe zone environments). I've been in the same spot for 4 years because of how ""content"" I was. I achieved what some would call an extremely cozy weed bubble. I still believe to this day weed is a luxury for those who have already made it to where they want to be in life.

Thing is, I badly want more out of life. I badly want more out of myself, too. A little voice that grew louder in me was desperate to show my flawed lifestlye :

\-It has happened many times that smoking was the first thing on my mind and my hand in the morning.

\- When I use I will literally continue to smoke untill I pass out in my bed from *high exhaustion*.

\- I became nervous when I was getting close to the end of my stock.

\- I used to think about ‘sober life’ and all the better things I could be doing after getting high.

\- Ironically, mundane tasks would require weed.

\- Accepting the fact that weed hadn’t felt ‘good’ to smoke in a long time was extremely difficult.

\- My day would be gone into limbo as soon as I lit up.

\- I have tried moderation that would quickly turn me back into my old self.

\- I’ve been getting high for years and have become tired of that specific, fleeting, only partially satisfying, very familiar type of high that only downregulates with time.

**- The constant feeling of living under your true potential and calibre.**

9 months ago I made a video named ‘why I’m quitting weed’. All I have to say is my 4 month relapse is part of the journey. Addiction will have you LITERALLY fall in love with the idea of doing it again – ‘Just one last time, it won’t do any harm’. That voice is ALWAYS a lier. Everything the voice says is a lie to get me to give in to the bad habit. The addiction never makes you WANT to quit. So I’m not hateful towards myself for slipping up after a hard breakup.

I still struggle to fully accept the damages on my growth weed has caused. What I can accept is the spheres that were affected : Physical, Mental, Spiritual, Relationships, Social Skills, Hobbies, Passions, Personality and Character.  All of those suffered from my smoking habits.

Also, I don’t believe going clean will make my life any better. In fact, I’m sure it’s going to suck fat dick for another long period of time. Shit ain’t easy. I’ve been feeling all sorts of emotions that are hard to deal with, especially boredom. At the end of the day, though, the ultimate goal is to love myself so much that I don’t need to smoke. I get to decide that I can exercise, meditate, keep my space clean and perform well at work without this ‘treat’ I used to give myself, like a dog. It’s a bit like leveling up as a human.

The problem with this motivation is that willpower suffers from ego-depletion. It truly is a limited ressource. And I believe one day I will encounter ego-depletion. I relapsed because I lost self-confidence from a failed relationship. The trigger could be anything. So I’ve changed my strategy from 9 months ago.

One way I intend to reinforce my willpower is to recognize a new personnal written Law: I Will Never Smoke Again. It doesn't require will power for me not to rob a bank. The Law cannot be broken at any point. Any thought that pops in my head that contradicts the Written Law is the Old Man, not me. This Old Man lives inside of me – he’s ugly, smells like piss, chain smoking blunts. Oh, did I mention he’s got cancer lost all his teeth? So screw you old man. My true self is already free of this addiction – cravings only happen to this Old Man, and without me giving in, one day he will die. I’ve been telling him off in a quick asshole-y approach. Human beings can achieve insane feats,so  fuck-off old man I’m trying to stop smoking a non-physically addictive drug here, this ain’t heroin.

There’s never a happy ending in the middle of the story, so I’ll keep on livin’. I feel like I’ve taken care of myself enough during the pandemic to make this decision much more manageable. Again, my focus is not to take weed away from my life, but to concentrate on adding more into my life. I feel like I’ve already done the most difficult part, which is to get yourself mentally where you are 100% ready to leave weed behind and move on with your life. So I’m getting back on that horse and not looking back.",14

Yea I got high and I had nice ass Nic sessions, but honestly I feel like the weed high has created such a dynamic in me now that I just can't be that same stoner and addict me. I'm scared to go back to how I was and the high I had today made me realize that I won't and I shouldn't  (I'm high rn lol). I feel as if this high may be a good thing because it makes reminds me what being high does to you. As such, I know the dangers of overindulging. I'm going to continue this sober lifestyle I don't care about weed or Nic that much anymore I have other things to think about. 

On a final note, my goal is to one day be at a party or social place, have weed offered to me and I turn it down for whatever reason. When I first started going sober I sort of used this scenario to strive for prioritizing the more important things in my life. What do you guys think?",6

Like really bad, made me think I may need meds because of the explosive mood swings I had. And to be fair...I’m not ruling that out either. But anyway, it sucks because I had been enjoying abstinence so much and on that life high and then it changed for a while.

But I came out of it. You always come out of it. That’s the point of this post. It’s all temporary, and even if you’re having a hard month, it’s worth it for the better *year* in your future.

Instant gratification is what we’re fighting here. It’s not worth it to give into hollow temporary pleasures.

What I’m realizing is, Jesus Christ, we’re in a pandemic. A lot of my mood problems were unrelated to being without weed - it’s just a hard fucking time in the world right now and we’re all worse for the wear. We need to be easy on ourselves right now, too.

I'm 25, started smoking at 15, and then once turning 21 in a legal state became a daily all day smoker.

Day 1 was alright during the day, I got a lot of yardwork done and spent a lot of time with my pets, but last night was really rough.

I did my usual nighttime routine of yoga, sleepytime tea and my meds which usually puts me right to sleep but I couldn't fall asleep. Finally made it to sleep around 3am.

I know that there’s no such thing as moderation for me when it comes to this drug. So far, i really haven’t had many cravings, knock on wood. I’m sure that will come when this honeymoon period is over (in the past 2 years of trying to quit, I’ve only had 3 or 4 times where I’ve made it this far.  The longest I made it was a ~100 days, but the other times I only made it like ~30 days, so i know that honeymoon period is going to end soon), but I have a plan for that. I saw another person posting on here saying that whenever you feel cravings, do as many push-ups or planks as you can do, so that your brain will start to associate cravings with physical discomfort. 

Honestly, I think I’m strong enough to escape my dependency, and be free of this drug forever.  But I know it won’t always be as easy as it’s been right now. 

Thank you all for the support and motivation, as well as the optimism that even if it’s your 10th time trying to quit, that might be the time that works!

I woke up about 30 minutes ago and just stood up 5 minutes ago to go to the bathroom. For about 4 seconds i had a splitting headache and then it was gone. I stood up pretty quickly like normal, and it was gone before I could even take a step.

Been clean for a month as of yesterday, and I thought I'd fill y'all in as to where I've got to, I see a LOT of posts where people manage to return to a relative normal after 2-3 weeks and I just wanted to let those that have longer symptoms know that they aren't alone.

I'm in my early 30's, smoking joints with tobacco for about 15 years, with a 1-2g a day habit for nearly 10 of those. I weaned myself for one week and then went cold turkey for both substances.

First a little week by week breakdown

Week 1 - Started off with zero apetite, lots of shaking, lots of sweating in the daytime especially my hands and feet, intense cravings the first couple of days but they died down pretty quick. Fatigue was intense and I spent 90% of my days in bed. Nights weren't too bad, first dream was around night 6 and it was pretty cool, not much in the way of night sweats. My heart rate was racing, standing up it would stabilise at 130-140, sitting down around 100-110, lying down it may have got down to 80 at times, lots of chest pain.

Week 2 - still zero appetite, but I started to manage to get at least 1000 calories in me thanks to huel meal shakes, daytime sweating calmed down but was replaced with night sweats, waking multiple times a night and having to towel myself off and find some dry blanket and mattress, the nightmares began on day 10-11 and I found them very troubling and very vivid for a good 3 nights, often with dreams continuing from where I left off and having a much more real feeling than usual. Heart rate still much the same, I got a blood pressure monitor around this time too, and found that it was at 140/90 most days until the evening, when it would drop a little, chest pains got very intense and throughout the week I had a few moments where I genuinely feared that my life was on the line, fatigue got even worse and just going to the loo would terrify me and I would take my phone, just in case I collapsed.

Week 3 - Things began to get a little easier this week, I was still in bed most of the time and incredibly tired, but I no longer had the fear of death as much, chest pains still very apparent but not quite so intense. Dreams became more normal in their content but did not drop off in quantity, and night sweats continued. I managed to up my nutrition through more huel shakes and got to 1600-2000 calories a day. Blood pressure still high in the morning, but it began to tail off a little earlier in the day, heart rate would still spike when I moved around, but not to the same extent with it rarely going above 120. Managed to do some very light pottering about on my patio for exercise.

Week 4 - Not a huge amount of change, heart rate and blood pressure normalised a little bit more, but still all over the place, heart rate in the evening would sometimes drop into the 50's, still fairly constant chest pain, but lighter. Managed to start eating the very occasional solid meal. Dreams and night sweats still extreme, and whilst I had a couple of days with ~10 hours out of bed, I was still very tired.

Week 5 - Chest pain is intermittent, but still gives me a bit of anxiety, eating one solid meal a day with huel for breakfast & lunch, heart rate staying relatively normal except when my anxiety plays up, blood pressure occasionally high in the morning but not up near the danger zone. Dreams have dropped down to ~2 a night, but I'm still waking up in a pool of sweat each time. Fatigue is very much still present, but I'm managing 12 hours out of bed with the occasional nap.

And that brings me to today, I still feel weird and out of place, and unsure of what I'm doing with my time, I haven't got the concentration or anxiety control to play video games, and a brisk walk still sets my pulse racing with an arrhythmia when i rest for about 15 minutes. breakfast and lunch is still huel, with little intention of that changing in the near future. Because I spent so much time lying down when I was eating I've given myself a pretty bad case of acid reflux, which has it's own set of sharp stabbing chest pains - which don't help my anxiety at all, but I can reason with them as a symptom of GERD, rather than an issue with my heart. I've started talking to an addiction and rehab specialist who calls me every week, and they have been incredibly reassuring that my symptoms are common with those that have a long, rough time with weed withdrawal.

Throughout this process I must have had a dozen phone calls with my GP, the non-emergency healthcare line and even the emergency services, I had ambulances called out twice and whilst they had concerns - I wasn't immediately dying and going to hospital at this time is a terrible idea. I have also been in constant contact with both my therapist and counsellor, who helped immensely in managing my anxiety. I would also really like to thank the r/leaves community, every time my anxiety flared up, or I had a symptom that concerned me, you guys would be my first place to go, scrolling through months of replies finding other people that were going through the exact same, and seeing they were still posting recently really helped me rationalise my symptoms and suppress my anxiety. And being able to share my experiences with others that were a few days behind me, and hopefully managing to bring them some calm, helped me feel like I was more in control of my situation, and that I was improving - one day at a time.

Here's to the next month, and hopefully feeling a little bit better still by the end of it, I've got this, We've got this.

Love, DNW.",20

The first week was just sweating like an absolute pig, I was so depressed and angry and would lash out at literally anyone. I’m less agitated now, mood swings are still there but more controllable. I haven’t had massive cravings to smoke, except after dreams about my bloody ex. I’ve got to say the worst thing about quitting has been the intense dreams, I still wake up around 3/4 times a night, sweating it out, like those dreams were real life, which is sometimes a bit hard to shake. I am finally hungry and able to eat full meals, I don’t struggle to find things to say to people anymore. I think I’m finally over the worst. I slept for 10 hours last night!!!!(only managing 3/4 hours a night before this) 

The thing is, I’ve done something I never ever thought was possible. After 8 years, of being unable to even be me, I think I’m slowly finding my truth, and that makes me so fucking proud of myself. 

I pray I will never go back, that it won’t consume my life again, because for the first time in my rememberable life, I feel like a person again. 

To everyone who thinks they can’t do it, you fucking can. Those withdrawal feelings pass, and once you get past the peak of the physical issues, you will be so utterly proud of where you have come. 

To all the people who have messaged me and spoken to me and supported me through these 2 weeks I am forever full of love and grateful for you. I don’t think I could’ve done this alone. 

We will get through this stronger and brighter and more confident than before.

I actually could imagine myself very possibly getting high today to relieve the stress but I know I can't. I've gone through 9 days sober and I feel like this is just too much. Just knowing I can't makes me cry in frustration, at work!! I just miss it so bad. And it's funny because my previous posts here I'm always saying that quitting isn't so bad. Ugh it makes me want to drink but I don't want to replace my desire for weed with alcohol because it's just unhealthy and goes against me wishing to stay sober (from everything). 

I'm just down, upset, and on the verge of bursting into tears on my break at work. Is it supposed to feel this awful when you can't have what once provided you relaxation? Why did weed ruin some things to the point where I had to quit? Why can't I just get high tonight? I know I shouldn't and I won't but oh my God this sucks!!!

I’ve recently quit regular use of marijuana couple of months ago, however I have had a few hits here and there. Completely clean for around 2-3 weeks. 

I decided to quit due to social anxiety increasing and my short term memory significantly decreasing. 

I can definitely see a change in my social anxiety as I’m able to live my life without thinking people are judging me etc.

I want to know what other effects smoking regularly for the 3 years of my life has had on me (mentally and physically). Maybe things that I am unable to understand now because I think this is normal. I did smoke before 19 but rarely. 

Also how long will it take for me to start seeing more improvements and what improvements can I expect? 

I have also been reading to increase my intelligence however it is pretty hard for me to concentrate sometimes still. 

Also another question, most of my friends still smoke regularly, will the second hand smoke affect my improvements from quitting? If it does I have to avoid being in those situations.

So I guess it’s finally time for me to give back with some words of encouragement. I’ve been seeing a lot of posts and comments from people in their first month of quitting, which is awesome. 

I was an all-day every-day smoker for 4 years. I’ve been without weed for 367 days now and this past year has been the best of my life so far. Here’s what’s changed:

- I can focus! I can sit down and have productive, fulfilling conversations. I remember stuff I did with my friends, even small conversations. I can recall funny moments. This is huge for me as before I really was in a constant mental fog. Now I have interesting things to say. 

- Related, my relationships with my friends and family have improved drastically. I’m so much more engaged in the lives of others around me.

- Lost 20 pounds without really trying, guess the munchies got to me more than I thought.

- DREAMS!! I have vivid dreams almost every night. And sleep, guys. I sleep SO well now. I can fall asleep within an hour and wake up at a reasonable time. I always used weed to fall asleep but it was never satisfying and I no longer wanna stay in bed past noon.

- I have so much free time! I’ve picked up interesting new hobbies (rock climbing and coding) and I run almost every day. I cook and bake cool shit. It’s neat how willing I am to try new stuff now. I had to lose my comfort zone when I quit, and have grown a lot for it.

- My self-esteem has skyrocketed. When I quit, I had to do a lot of reflection. Turns out being high isn’t the greatest way to introspect. My personality has returned, and I like it. Physically, my eyes are clear, my face is bright. And I’m way better at taking care of myself.

- The big one: I’m motivated. I can look into the future, reflect on the past, and make critical decisions about my actions quickly. I guess I didn’t realize how complacent I’d become, but without the crutch of weed I am able to view my circumstances with clarity and certainty. 

The first month (or 2, or 3) was really hard guys. I couldn’t sleep, I was anxious, I couldn’t fucking do anything and I almost gave in so many times. I’m so glad I didn’t. Weed is great, but it wasn’t working for me. The changes are small - almost imperceptible while they’re happening. But holy shit it adds up. I just... feel good. And when I don’t feel good I buck up and deal with what’s making me feel bad. Quitting is the best decision I’ve ever made for myself. It’s an act of self-love, seriously. You’re all amazing and you deserve to feel amazing!

TLDR; It gets so much easier, I promise. If you feel like nothing is changing, wait it out. Much love!",18

Sobriety is terrifying and beautiful.,"I know people who have gone through withdrawals for harder things than weed, but I really never thought I'd have such terrible experiences as the last few days. Day 3 was the absolute worst with the stomach pains, inability to sleep, and fears about my overall health. But day 4 was yesterday and it was better, and I actually slept a full freaking night last night for the first time in two weeks. Today after work I cooked a healthy meal and walked outdoors for 2 hours with some great music. No bad feelings in my heart. No anxiety about my health. Not a single craving for weed or to get high or drink to replace the smoke. No worries at all. It's like all the poison has bled out of my system. I know I'll have to fight these symptoms of withdrawal again, but I am so happy at how good I feel already.  


I checked out the app Grounded and it's been good at keeping me in check the last few days, watching how much I'm saving and logging my progress.  


If you're suffering through the first few days of quitting weed cold turkey after being a heavy ass smoker like I was, I want you to know it WILL get better.

Stuff like replying to texts, writing emails, meeting up with sober friends all were a nightmare to me that I avoided due to being stoned. So much time spent second guessing my words and obsessing over people's responses for no reason.

The only time I could really message people was when I first woke up and wasn't high. Of course I would always reward myself by getting high immediately after.

Today I had this INTENSE desire to talk to people. I've spent all day today messaging old friends and kind of taking them by surprise lmao. Positive responses though mostly, people happy to hear from me. I swear I've been on a people and communication high. Perhaps it's just thrilling to make human contact after being in a dark hole for so long.

anyways, my girlfriend stayed over last night, and left this morning so she could head back home to prepare for a job interview at 1pm. after she left, i tidied around the house, went out and bought a used lawn mower, listened to a podcast, and watched a bunch of youtube videos; mostly educational ones. a little while ago, i facetimed with her and discussed our plans for the next few days. now, i’m about to strap on my headphones and take my dog for a good walk around the neighbourhood, then come back and call it a night. 

i know you guys can’t possibly know me and how hooked on weed i was, but the fact i’m on this trajectory and being this successful with it is something i never could have imagined. if i can do it... you can too. i know i’m only on day 14, and it’s entirely possible i might not have this confidence in the weeks to come, but this time truly feels different.

2020-05-07 19:41:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gfhzdk/45_days_without_weed_my_story/,"45 DAYS WITHOUT WEED, MY STORY!","Hey guys, so I thought id share my story. I felt like success stories helped me more than anything else whilst dealing with withdrawals, so whoever is seeing this I hope this can help. Im gonna start with my addiction and then the withdrawal period.

So ive been smoking pretty much daily for 2 years now. During the first year I thoroughly enjoyed smoking, it made me feel good, was great for socialising and made sex awesome! The change happened around last summer. I came home from university and started smoking weed from London. Typically, I've found that weed in London is much more potent than other regions of the UK. I immediately started getting paranoid every time I smoked, but was too addicted to stop so continued smoking daily. It became so bad the day after I smoke i would wake up with terrible anxiety and then smoke to get rid of my anxiety. This only made the anxiety and depression worse. Fast forward, by the end of summer I had horrible social anxiety, become quite overweight, destroyed my confidence because I would question my every thought repeatedly and depression. I stopped for 2 weeks then relapsed when I returned to university. 

I returned to university, and because i was in a house of smokers I relapsed. As I mentioned above the weed outside London is considerably less potent, it definitely reduced the level of anxiety I would experience. But I found that I had a whole host of new problems. I was so demotivated, stupid and greatly struggled with University work which I would usually find easy. I know that I am capable of a first class honours at university but was struggling because of weed! Weed! Not only this, but I began to choose weed over everything, social gatherings, friends and my girlfriend. This drug almost destroyed the best part of my life (relationship) because I wasn't in the right mind to appreciate and understand what I had. Thank god she was patient with me but I put her through so much unnecessarily. SO THEN I DECIDED FUCK THIS SHIT, I WAS SICK OF ALL THIS BULLSHIT AND WANTED TO BE MORE THAN JUST SOME LOSER SLOB WHO SITS AROUND ACHIEVING NOTHING. Listed below were the the reasons I decided that I wanted a change:

* Anxiety
* Depression
* Severe Forgetfulness (I literally had no short term memory)
* Demotivation
* Choosing weed over other, more important parts of my life
* Losing all hobbies to weed
* Laziness
* Empty Wallet
* Weird thing to say but I kinda forgot who I was.
* Weed and my fellow smokers became my only friends

So then, 45 days ago i quit cold turkey. Quarantine and Exam motivation helped because I had a reason to stay inside. Now its not plain sailing, the first month was probably the worst month ive ever been through. Some people say withdrawals are bad for a week or two but the rebound anxiety peaked for like a month. I would get anxious over stupid shit, like thinking I couldn't read or write. Maybe it was stupid trying to jump from having no brain cells and smoking to doing 3rd year calculus.I thought that I had GAD and was terrified that this anxiety was permanent. However my friends, there is light at the end of the tunnel! Im not saying its over but, through consistent exercise, less mobile phone usage, eating right, meditation and sheer will I have been able to drastically reduce the anxiety. Its not over, but my friends this 45 day journey has definitely been amazing. I may have lost a best friend, but all the new friends, better relationships, new found hobbies and happiness I would choose over anything. It takes time and hard work but its definitely worth it. To the next milestone, 60 days! I hope that whoever is reading this can take something from it, be relief, motivation to quit or anything really. WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER MY FRIENDS, AND WE WILL PREVAIL.",16
2020-05-07 19:39:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gfhyco/some_advice_on_taking_advice/,Some advice on taking advice.,"Hello /leavers!

I'm here today with a friendly reminder about taking advice from people here.

Of course, every single poster, is giving advice from a place of concern and caring, and I don't want to discourage ANYONE from giving advice. All advice is good advice, unless it obviously isnt, and I greatly appreciate the advice and support, since starting my /leaves journey, 15.5 days ago. Wouldn't have made it this far without it. Thanks everyone!

That said, NOT ALL ADVICE WORKS FOR EVERYONE! I know a lot of you are youth, and especially during COVID lockdown, may find yourselves in really hard situations.

It is important for you to take everything said here with a grain of salt, and critically assess whether or not it will work for you. While all advice comes from personal experience, what may work for one, may not work for another. 

If you are worried that something may cause adverse affects... only you know your body, and its important not to hurt yourself unintentionally. 

There's a lot of ""Get away from weed, those who smoke, and throw out everything in the house"" advice flying around, hell, its one of my top go tos, but we understand that is not always possible. You may be living with family who smoke, or under lockdown with smokers. You may not be at that point yet. Please, try not to be discouraged. 

The big thing though, is dietary and exercise advice. If you feel uncertain, if there's a nagging voice saying ""this might not be good"" then its important that you asses it for yourself,  and perhaps, talk to your parents or a doctor (if possible) before proceeding. 

What we say here, is by no means law, or your only options. If something doesn't work for you, please don't be discouraged.. or take it out on those trying to help. Each of us are complex individuals, and its important to asses if something will safely work for you.

If one person's advice isnt particularilly helpful, dont lose hope! You WILL find something that does help, and you WILL make it through this.

Please remember, you are not alone. We are here for you, to support you in any capacity we can, but like you, we are only human.

You got this!

Fn: To those giving advice, please don't be discouraged if someone doesnt take your advice. You are the ones helping keep us sober, and though one person doesnt like it, others are sure to see it, and be like ”This is just what I need!"" We greatly appreciate all of your effort!",3
2020-05-07 19:27:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gfhqog/dependent_on_weed_for_stomach_issues/,Dependent on Weed for Stomach Issues,"I have a preamble and a question, I hope it's not too long. 

Today is my first day making the attempt to stop smoking. I am not happy being a pothead. I have been smoking every day for the past 5+ years, and the excuse has always been that it helps with my stomach issues so much, that I feel like I have to rely on it. It has been a long and hard struggle to get to a place where my health is somewhat stable. My stomach is strong enough now that I was able to go back to work, but I've continued smoking in the evenings, and some days my stomach still flares up and I need to call in sick (in which case I'll do nothing but smoke all day). I haven't yet gotten to a place where I no longer have any flare ups or stomach issues at all. Until now, I have been telling myself that #1 is get my health in order, and once that is strong I will have the support I need to be able to quit smoking. 

Last week, my doctor suggested that smoking weed may actually be somehow blocking me from healing (although I am quite certain it's not the cause of my illness). 

It is so daunting to consider stopping smoking weed even though my health isn't as strong as I want it to be. But I'm using this as my motivation, that if I stop smoking weed, maybe that will be the key to getting rid of my health problems for good. This first day has been mostly OK, but my stomach started to really bother me, and the temptation to smoke weed to make the pain go away is strong. But I feel like the only way to get through it is to just wait it out until I feel better on my own, and cross fingers that stopping weed will help me reach that goal. 

&#x200B;

My question is, has anyone else ever heard of anyone experiencing negative stomach symptoms from smoking weed? My impression had always been that it's supposed to help with nausea and appetite etc, which has been my experience. I am very motivated to stop smoking completely for at least a few weeks and see if my stomach health starts to improve, but when I have an upset stomach it's so hard. 

&#x200B;

I have little faith in the doctor who gave me that advice, but since I have pretty much tried everything else, I feel like I have no choice but to give it a shot and see if it helps! The only way to find out for sure is to try...

Today is day 18 since I quit regular use. The journey's been intense so far, lots of questioning and irritability. I feel super proud of myself for quitting, after regularly smoking for 3 years I thought I'd have a harder time making this decision.

There's a lot of good happening since I quit. I engaged in a bunch of little creative projects, like drawing, journaling everyday, planning (and not doing the greatest job at accomplishing it) to read more books. I feel my head is a lot clearer, it's easier and faster to get shit done, I'm overrall okay with the decision.

However, ever since quitting, I feel this huge emptiness that none of these new habits have been able to fill. I honestly miss it, but I know I'm better off because it's forcing me to look to this void. I don't understand it and I don't really think weed was filling it, just keeping my mind off of it and creating the illusion that I had everything under control as long I was high. I'm dealing with personal stuff too, difficult stuff, and I really miss my crutch. Days like this make me realize that if I had access to weed right now, I'd probably smoke it. It made me very aware that a huge part of why I was using it was to avoid dealing with what I have to deal.

This makes it difficult, makes me angry at times, makes me feel like I'm not enough for not being able to deal with stuff without MJ. But also shows me that if, and hopefully I will, survive all of this, I'll feel much stronger and wholesome for being able to win my fights with a sober and clear mind.

Share your current struggles if you're going through any. This place really helps me vent when I'm in days like this. Day 18 is huge for me, and I wish you guys can continue strong in your decision of quitting. Stay safe, y'all. :)",3

This is my first birthday without weed since i turned 16. Im 50 days without weed and i never thought that this will happen. I have acquintances that doesn’t smoke but no friends.

I was with two of my closest friends today that smoked, I wanted to smoke SO bad, but I didn’t, I bought a beer at the store instead. After that I went to maybe my closest friend, and he is the heaviest smoker I know of; We’re talking 20 grams a day if he has access to it. Thats when I REALLY wanted to smoke, because it was 50 days since I smoked, and he has free weed, AND I have birthday in 4 hours, why shouldn’t I smoke? 

I couldn’t find any reason to not smoke so I just went to a bar and started drinking beer and watching prison break on my phone by myself. And i fucking had fun. I like being sober, and even more, I like not hating myself the morning after.

Now i am 21 years old while I’m writing this, and i am fucking sober. Tomorrow I’m going out with my gf to eat, and then come back home to a homemade cake from my mom. This isn’t so bad.

Stay strong guys. I smoked 2.5 grams a day (500NOK/50$). I thought I would kill myself before I turned 20. I turned 21 8 minutes ago.

If I can stop smoking with all thes weed around me, so can you. Much love from Oslo, Norway!",14
2020-05-07 17:50:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gfg1gm/1_month_benefits_experience/,1 MONTH! Benefits & Experience,"So today is officially one month since I've had any THC in my system and I must say my life feels so much better. On top of not smoking I also stopped fapping so I will be writing about one month off weed and PMO, but focusing on weed. I am writing this because through my journey I like to come on this thread and read about other peoples storys and success to motivate me and remind myself why im doing this. Heres my story

I started smoking seriously the summer going into Senior year (17 years old), I am a sophomore in college now (20). I smoked a handful of times before that but never really enjoyed it or went out of my way to buy it, I would say senior year is when I started considering myself a ""stoner"", and I guess I was proud of it. When I first started smoking it would be late at night out my window out of a soda can (real OGs know what that means), and it was always when my parents were sleeping. Looking back on it, I dont know how I ever got away with that because my mom now has a nose for weed so I couldnt even if i wanted to. I loved how it made me feel. I would lay in bed with my headphones on and forget about everything. My body felt great, the music sounded so much better, and when I jerked off it felt like nothing ive ever felt before. 

Fast forward to when weed started ruining my life... My parents HATE weed with a passion, and ive tried so many times to change their mind but it wont work and i dont try anymore. Ive been pulled over twice with weed in the car and both times the cops never searched, I take that as a sign. I got caught at college with weed and almost got me kicked off the football team, which would have ruined my life because my plan is to make it to the NFL. Overall, my life was just consumed with the thought of weed. from the moment I woke up i was thinking about when I would get high again. Whenever my parents left  I would go outside and smoke right away, then come back in the house, shower, brush my teeth, and put eye drops in. I started to realize that it wasnt worth it and I had a problem. Here are my benefits

Benefits since I stopped

* Less stress
* Enjoy time with my parents (less tip toeing around them)
* More time to do what I want
* Working on my craft
* Better sleep (amazing dreams)
* Clearer head
* Better appetite
* Less social anxiety/better eye contact
* Improved confidence
* Less stumbling over my words
* More motivation

What Ive accomplished

* Meditation
* Reading
* Exercise
* Journaling my life
* Vision board

Basically, I encourage everyone to stop smoking weed daily and see how much better it makes your life. I wish I knew this a while ago when I though smoking everyday and being high all the time was ""cool"". It affects everyone different. Some people can live their life fine with weed but once I smoke, all my motivation and drive goes down the drain and all I want to do is lay in bed and watch Sunny in Philly. I do say I miss the days when weed made me feel amazing and maybe one day ill be able to enjoy it in moderation and feel how I felt back when I started but for now, I need to rebuild my life.

2020-05-07 17:10:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gffar8/4_days_off_after_most_days_for_6_years_couldnt_be/,"4 days off after most days for 6 years, couldn’t be happier right now","After reading this I realise it’s a lot of tangents and insignificant details so be warned.

I’m writing this to remind myself when I struggle in the future, lay out all my thoughts about this that the “cloud” from smoking is stopping me from piecing together in my head, and hopefully it’ll help someone else too.

For the last 5 years it’s been mainly a bong, just a couple pinches after work or a few more on a day off. I always thought I was better than my friends that smoked massive joints all the time, partly due to their surprise whenever I’d tell them how little I was using in comparison, but also because I had stopped for a week or two multiple times. If I was honest with myself I’d know that I was only able to do that because it’s pretty easy when none of your hookups are around, or you’ve only got enough for a ten bag so it’d be better spent on cheap booze for the night. If it was legal here I’d still be on it.

The only reason I stopped this time is lockdown made it impossible for me to get more. The last day I smoked I was so uptight the whole day knowing I was about to run out that I didn’t even enjoy what I had left, when I ran out I text a friend to see if he knew anyone that was around. While waiting for a response I remembered r/leaves from when I frequented reddit years ago and thought I’d read some of that to help me for a few days in case I had no luck. Well I read u/rajatk14’s post on here and i was too familiar with too many of the points they made and decided I should quit for a month. Over the next 48 hours I had no appetite, I had a slice of toast and this went straight through me (sorry). Trying to sleep was a joke and I felt horrific because of it, I can barely remember what else happened the first day, mainly stared at the wall I think because I was too lazy to even put Netflix on. A combination of this and reading more posts here made me realise this is not the way for me to live and I can’t go back after a month or a year or for as long as I want a functioning life.

Looking back now I know that what I always thought was just something to entertain me while I was doing other stuff was actually stopping me from enjoying these things properly, or getting up and doing what you’re supposed to when you’re in your 20s and need to better yourself. In the past I’ve gone months without a haircut because i just get stoned on my day off and say I’ll do it next week, oh wait it’s raining now I’ll stay in, smoke up and do it next week, rinse repeat. I know it’s mundane but that makes me realise the time I have wasted.
I absolutely love film ever since I was a kid I’ve watched loads and of course smoking made them more enjoyable, over this last month I’ve taken the opportunity to watch lots on my list but if you put a gun to my head right now I couldn’t remember more than a few. I used to read a lot as well, when I was a teen I’d have multiple books on the go and probably averaged a book a week, since I started smoking regularly that’s more like a book a year because I can’t read more than a couple pages without having to go over it again and again. In comparison to when I was 18 my vocabulary is shit (for lack of a better word).

In the last two days I’ve read a book I’ve had on my shelf for months, cleaned the oven that should have been done months ago also and watched my favourite film Withnail and I, I can remember it all and it’s the most I’ve laughed at a film for a long time.

Still got a long way to go until I return to “normal” and it sounds like I’ve had it easier than a lot of people on here, but I’m already incentivise ld to keep going and I can’t wait until I can think clearly again. Today I bought a laptop and am going to try and write a novel which I’ve wanted to do for almost a decade now.

If you read all this you deserve a medal, good luck.",8

I've used the excuse that all my friends smoke, so I can't quit. I'm my own keeper. My friends will still love me.

I’ve made some really shitty choices because of weed, and I definitely hurt my parents very badly with my actions and words. And it was almost always driven by my avoidance of my emotions or my inability to confront hard truths because I was high and didn’t want to deal with it.

I have a lot on my mind and no where to let it out. If I don't tell someone I feel like I'll explode. Hopefully this is the beginning of a success story.

&#x200B;

I guess I'll start by introducing myself. I'm a 20 year old college student (m) from the States. I'm a double bio and math major and a rookie powerlifter. At first glance I seem fine. I'm not. I have issues with myself, and weed has made everything so much worse.

&#x200B;

I lived my entire life vice free. I've never drank, smoked tobacco, and until after high school I had never even thought about smoking weed. I didn't want to. That changed very quickly. On January 1st, 2018 I lost one of my best friends, JJ, to suicide. At the same time my father disowned me and broke off all communication with me. We were always very close, even after my parents split. It broke my heart.

&#x200B;

I started smoking shortly after. I remember the first time I hit a dab pen. I told myself it would be a one time thing, afterwards I'd never touch drugs again. I've smoked every day since then. It made me forget about the regrets I had when I lost JJ. It made me forget that my dad didn't want me at his funeral. I thought I had solved the problem and was happy. Until I came down.

&#x200B;

I've known for a long time that weed has been hurting me. The high keeps me going but every time I came down I felt terrible. Weed helps with anxiety and depression, but what they don't tell you is that it's not a fix-all. It doesn't resolve anything, it just covers it up. I thought I was fine, for 2 years I smoked and had a great time. Now I realize that everything I was covering up wasn't getting better, it was getting exponentially worse. I used to be a happy and carefree person. Now, a day doesn't go by where I don't think about killing myself.

&#x200B;

I've told those close to me that I know weed is bad for me. They laugh it off and tell me I'm just overthinking it.

&#x200B;

I don't feel right saying that I'm depressed. I don't have a reason to be. Sure, life is shitty sometimes but it's also pretty great, right? I keep telling myself I'm ok, but I can't stop the nagging thoughts in the back of my head. I contemplate suicide everyday. Last year on JJ's birthday I broke down completely. I wrote a note for everyone I cared about and tried to end my life by downing 80+ Tylenol PM pills. Immediately after the fact I freaked out and induced vomiting. I knocked out for 24 hours and felt terrible for several days, but I was alive. But now I'm scared. The only reason I'm still here is because I couldn't bring myself to hurt my parents, my siblings, my girlfriend, by leaving them. I feel this immense pain, but I also realize that if I'm gone I'm only passing that pain down to my loved ones. I can't bring myself to do that.

&#x200B;

I haven't told anyone, whether close or distant, about these thoughts or my attempt at suicide. Sometimes I wish I could. It gets lonely. I wish I could tell my girlfriend that I'm scared I'll attempt suicide again on JJ's birthday this year. I wish I could tell my big sister that I'm not ok, and cry silently in my room every morning. I wish I could tell my mom that sometimes I don't think life's worth living. I wish I could tell my best friends that I need help. But I don't want to worry anyone. I don't want to cause stress to the people I love. I'll figure it out, I just need time.

&#x200B;

I know weed didn't cause me to end up where I am. I'm not blaming it. However I do now understand that it's not something I can allow myself to enjoy while my emotions are all over the place. I can't keep covering up my regrets by smoking. The lows are too low, and if things continue this way I don't think I'll be able to stop myself next time. 

&#x200B;

Today is day 1. I'm very thankful to have found this community. I spent hours reading different posts from different people all over the world. I hope that by quitting this habit I'll be able to take the first steps toward getting better, just like so many others here. I know it's going to be rough, but this is the only option I have.

This community was a huge help, especially in the first month or so. I wanted to share what I've learned since starting my weed free journey. 

First, the basics - get rid of EVERYTHING weed related. Delete your dealers number.

Write down your reasons for quitting. Separate these into your BIG reasons why and other perks of quitting. Revisit when you're having cravings. 

Tell everyone you feel comfortable with that you're quitting and ask them to hold you accountable.

Be gentle with yourself during withdrawal. For example, I struggled with my appetite, so if all I could stomach was mac n cheese and cake for the day, that was ok. Withdrawal sucks, but the temporary discomfort is so worth it.

If you are able, I highly recommend seeing a mental health professional. It took a few therapists for me to find one that I really clicked with, so if it doesn't feel like a good fit at first, don't give up.

Find a hobby or activity to keep your mind off of weed when you have a craving. For me it was reading and cooking. It helps to make a long list of things you could do instead of smoking. 

Once you've got some weed free time under your belt, your brain might try to trick you into thinking you can go back to smoking in moderation. I'm going to share a mantra that I read from another leaver: I cannot have a reasonable relationship with this plant. Most of us are in this community because that is true.

**- Douglas Adams (The Salmon of Doubt)**

15 Days. seems more half-month-point than 14. Though, the only reason I'm actually counting, is for the sake of organisation. 15 days seems a lot like 1, with less(ish) withdrawl symptoms. Yet... kinds feel just as close to smoking today, as day one. I suspect day 599636 will feel the same.

Am just so completely and utterly, emotionally and physically, drained. Been a lot more irritable the last couple of days. And theres this gaping hole, all consuming emptiness, in my chest.

Maybe in part, seeing the ""success stories"" of how people quit smoking, then fall back into the idealist perfect world, get amazing (to them) jobs, make friends, get married, have kids.. Is super demotivating. 

I can say, with almost complete certainty, that its not jealousy or envy. Though, my mother always wanted grandchildren... Just... The world moves so fast around, and yet... Even after the lockdown, aside from my father,  its unlikely I will see more than 3 people in a weeks time, even in passing. And will certainly wont talk to a single one... and... I'm not sure thats so bad.

Yet, this gaping hole remains, and the outpouring of positivity and support, does nothing than widen it.. Remind me of what / who I can never be. 

Like the person who is always happy all the time, and how you instinctualy want to vomit. Or like Durden says to himself, after savagely beating another, so he's unrecognisable as the handsome youth he was: ""I wanted to destroy something beautiful."" Except, there is no beauty here.

""Fuck, I would kill for a smoke""

Yet even that rings hollow. Smoking wont fill that hole, only turn it into more of a chasm.

Ah well. Such is Life. Another foot forward, even if the path inevitably leads off a cliff.

On the other hand, This morning was the first morning I didnt spit out mouthfuls of blood, brushing my teeth.. So thats... motivating.",3

At Age 13 I was riding my bike everyday to my friend 15 to smoke I would always have to be at a cool smoke spot before I could smoke I remember going far into the woods just to spark up!
I had Love at first sight the smell the color the everything had me hooked! I was a skateboarder and I would skate daily all my skater bros smoked and it was really enjoying sometimes to just smoke with friends and get away from home life.

After the first year I was starting to lose weight and had been chubby throughout elementary school I thought wow this is the weed i started to like the way i looked! 
This gave me alot of confidence I had a new body and new brain ""I didnt know my brain was different at the time"". I started acting out in school getting sent to detention everyday and eventually getting hauled out of school by the police I smoked a joint in the school bathroom the camera saw me going in and out. My first day in juvenile detention I met the most intriguing cannabis user's almost every kid in juvenile smoked weed lol. My father left me there for a week to teach me a lesson, when he finally came to get me out I was sold on never smoking again at least until I could handle it! I went on to take a test every month for two years I was charged with marijuana within 1000 ft of school finally I was 15 almost off of  probation and I started to see this weed called kush I never tried it but I wanted to so bad my probation was almost up instead of waiting until my 2 years where over ,I skipped school with a friend he had some kush we went to a old meth lab house in the neighborhood that was considered to be dangerous we smoked about a bowl out of a pencil eraser metal and a toilet paper tube.
5 minutes later the white police cars parked all outside we try and jump out the back and run but there they are they already knew we would run so they where waiting for us. This gave me 2 weeks in juvenile and an extra year of probation this time I was productive I managed to get far greater grade at school since I didnt want to smoke I knew I would be back in juvenile if I did. 
A year passed I was finally in court that day the judge told me I was a great person and that he saw alot of potential in me I was officially off of probation after 3 years that moment I thought about weed! 
As soon as I got home all I was thinking about is those red eyes warm feeling and I knew it was going to hit harder because that long 3 year break.
 I was a criminal I thought my whole teenage life was being treated like a criminal so what do I do? I started breaking into cars at night to get money it was dangerous i was only 16 and somebody in the neighborhood already got shot for doing this. I would do this to fund the weed until i would fail and one day have a gun in my face he held me by the arm and put me in his car and drove to find my accomplice he said he should have just shot me but he called the police and there I was in juvenile again I began to think this was the devils lettuce but now looking back it was a mixture of a childhood and addiction.
 I would go on to smoke and go back to juvenile several times until I turned 18 I was tired of it.
Tired of spending my money tired of memory loss and tired of not getting anywhere fast so I quit cold turkey .it was so easy I just remember going about the days like usual until a month passed and the urge came to smoke after drinking a little bit of vodka i went back to my old life smoking day by day until i was 19.
 I finally chose to quit forever within one year I doubled my income got a nice place and got employee of the month that whole year. Looking back at myself wanting to go back in time and undo the first puff. 
But now I'm stronger I can tell you quitting weed 30 times was hard but it got easier I knew how to quit I had certain coping methods I can't remember my first withdrawal because I've had so many !

Quarantine has ended where I live. We aren't yet allowed to meet friends but I guess we'll be able to do it in less than two weeks from now. Since January/February 2019 I haven't taken any psychoactive substance.

Spring has come and all these colors, the smell of jasmine flowers, give me vivid past memories, including memories about drugs and especially about marijuana. I have been diasgnosed with bipolar II (its onset has been catalized by my drug use) and since I quit I haven't been having any episodes (only mild depression every now and then, but it's probably related to life events). So it would be really stupid to take drugs because I know it would make me suffer.

I used to distract myself by going to university but now it's closed because of the virus. Unfortunately it would be easy for me to get anything I'd want and friends have already asked me to smoke or trip with them. And even if I can resist the temptation to go back to ""harder"" drugs, I still have the irrational thought that one joint every now and then can't be that bad.

During the last year I've never had these thoughts about smoking. I even started to feel anxious at the thought of doing it. But right now I feel less strong than usual. Anyway, thanks for reading this. I'm sure I won't be smoking anymore, but I needed to share these thoughts with someone who understands the situation. I hope I din't go off-topic.

I would heighten my sexual desires with weed you know. But it has impaired my learning, cognition, and memory to a large extent. I'm unable to feel positive about my life and I've literally made my future bleak. I had no reason to fuck up my life but I still did chasing those petty and temporary pleasures. I've never listened to my friends, teachers, parents, and basically anyone who gave me good advice. I've drunk/stoned texted the girls of my class as well. I've sold a gold ring and my bicycle bought to me by my father to support my addiction as well. Didn't pay the rent for two months at a place where I lived in and smoked as well during that time. Wasted a hell lot of my dad's hard earned money in these substances as well. Lots of time and money wasted in it. All problems of mine are self created, you know.

I think this is it, I’m done with weed, I’m sick of it.","Daily smoker for over 10 years. Bowls, bongs,cones,dabs, you name it I was smokin it. The last two years I’ve noticed just how much damage this thing has done to my body. 

-2 ER visits

-Severe anxiety... probably the worst part of it all
was the anxiety. I would smoke and instantly start thinking about things I have no control over, my heart would start racing and I would get extremely paranoid.

- Grandpa Cough ..... I’m the guy who would hit the bowl or blunt and start coughing terribly. I would split black/brownish phlegm. I couldn’t even laugh at times or else I would break into this massive cough 

- Money..... for the last two years Or so I’ve spent an average of $480 per month. You do the math. I can’t imagine how much I’ve spent lifetime 



I’m just here to say that I’m so over this drug. This is the longest I’ve gone sober and my body feels amazing. My head is clear, I’ve picked up working out/ jogging daily. My cough is gone. I no longer spit brown phlegm. I’ve saved $240. $240 in two weeks!! 
Now I’m excited to see what type of new hobbies I can pick up with all this extra weed money I’m going to have in my pockets!! Lol 
This community is awesome and to be honest I would not have quit if it weren’t for the inspiring post you guys post on here daily!! 

Cheer me on guys please!! Lol I need all types of encouragement right now. I’m sober and I feel
 great!!!! I want to scream at the top of my lungs to celebrate!! Now that they aren’t filled with black and brown tar shit haha. 

Thanks guy. Love",6

I’m writing this sitting on the bathroom floor at 4:30 in the morning because once again, I’ve woken up with a bad stomach ache from munching out last night. I have hated my relationship with weed for years and I’m so sick of my body and mind feeling like SHIT. 

Been smoking (about 2 grams) everyday from a bong for over 8 years! Im so used to this drug; feels like I need it for my body to function properly. I am a 27 year old kindergarten teacher and desperate for change. :( I don’t want to be this anymore. 

My fiancé (33) is a big time functional stoner and won’t ever change so I need to find the power within me to do this. I am trying to get pregnant with our first child so there’s no better motivator to stop than now. Every time I want to smoke today I am coming on ‘leaves’ instead and reminding myself I can do this!  I owe a lot of my motivation to those success stories I’ve read who used to be like me. I always felt I was alone in my struggle until I came here. 

Sincerely, Day 1.",3
2020-05-07 04:03:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gf2ejn/resistance_vs_renounce/,Resistance vs Renounce,"I have been dealing with my weed consumption for a couple of years now. I tried quitting several times, I've set rules, I've taken breaks, I have avoid buying and the last strategy was not getting rolling paper. I believed that putting barriers would help my brain to little by little forget about it but in less than three days I was back on it.

Now I am in a different spot.   
I *feel* that I am in a different spot. 

This came when, instead of applying resistance to smoking I started renouncing to it. By resisting I am putting a lot of effort and applying a lot of strength in trying not to use, I was sort of giving power to my powerlessness, like feeding the fact that I have to resist, which meant that I was not the one in control and some other force was being acted upon me.

This bigger force is what didn't click for me when I approached NA or recovery/addiction books or speeches like the one hold by Russell. 

By renouncing to it I am the one who decides. It feels almost like a 180degree swap in my perspective. I do not apply any force in resisting, instead I gain force by actively renounce to the use of the substance. I gain force by feeling shit on those first days of hell and withdrawal and still renounce. I gain force by pushing through a situation in which I'd be high in the past and now it feels like shit, and difficult, and uncomfortable and boring... oh my, the boredom is the worst part for me... but still I renounce to go to my box and roll one because if I do that I am giving away my power. I am accepting that I have no power over myself or my actions.

This feeling of powerlessness has been with me for a long time, each time putting me down a little bit more and I am thankful for it because I have learned a lot about myself from those. 

There were days where I just accepted my smoking habit as part of my, but I still could hear deep inside me that it was not right. I wanted (and want) to be a strong human. Solid. Capable. Strong enough to be able to govern myself.

Now I feel like coming to a peace point with the plant. Perhaps it is still to soon to say but I am feeling different around it. Yesterday my Gf wanted to smoke and I rolled one for her... and I was fine with it! Of course I wanted to smoke a bit, draw from that sweet cylinder but I actively renounced to it and it felt great, it felt powerful and solid. I begin to see weed as I see wine, an enjoyable and tasteful thing to take when the moment is appropriate or feels good, and just thinking about that sensation of control makes me keep cultivating an attitude of renounce. Actively giving myself strength and confidence, little by little every time desire arrives. 

Thank you all for keeping and nurturing this community. Much love to you all.",1

Smoking with my then "" best friend "", put me in the inner circle of cool older kids, or so I thought. 

I wanted to fit in and have a sense of belonging.

 In reality... the act of smoking, the high, the paranoia, I really didn't like it. I didn't like being all doped out. I was missing out on living life to it's fullest extent.

The initial act of putting a glass pipe to my lips, and having to inhaling fire, awful smelling smoke, & fumes was very devastating. It was not what I had imagined it to be, I didn't like it.

Little did I realize I was already cool, even before all the parties, dangerous behavior, lack of judgement etc. Weed robbed me of my peace and my sanity. True Friendships, faith, and relationships also.

 I thought I was doing the right thing, I sacrificed myself, just to end up as their laughing stock.

What I’ve learned so far...,"1) My brain is still interested in the things I like, even without weed. Gaming, scale model building, reading, weed didn’t give those to me, and it’s not going to take them from me either. Even though withdrawal is messing with me hard, sometimes I need to Nike shit - Just Do It. And the rest will fall into place.

2) My procrastination was greatly linked to weed. It wasn’t that my projects were too work-intensive or complex, it’s that I was high all the time and couldn’t commit to just doing the work. Sobriety really makes it hard to justify putting off something you know will bite your in the ass down the line.

3) The outdoors and exercise are my greatest weapons in this fight. Fresh air is wonderful! I’ve been doing a lot of low-impact exercise like long walks and yoga, and it’s mind blowing how good I feel after, just pure natural endorphins. 

4) If you’re like me and used to smoke before every meal, get you some meal replacement drinks like Boost, Ensure or smoothies. Getting solid food down has been really difficult so far, and I’ve had a couple of days where since I didn’t eat breakfast and I didn’t eat lunch it’s the afternoon and I’m still working but my brain is absolutely useless due to fog from the lack of calories. Which in turn, makes it harder to experience the benefits quitting - reduced lethargy, more work focus, etc. Keeping some liquid meals around is should make it a lot easier for me to handle this whole process. Plus, it’s just nice to not be hangry 😅

I knew it was time for me to get serious about quitting when, like many of you here, I started to do the whole ""want to get high when you're sober but wish you didn't while you're high"" act. The brain is pretty incredible with the excuses it comes up with to continue to partake, I've really surprised myself with the creativity.

My personal reasons for taking such a liking to weed is that I tend to take on others energies and am very sensitive to them, which I didn't realize until recently and it has happened my entire life. 

People who do this are usually called empaths. I try not to label and encapsalate something as multi-faceted as my personality ;) but I can relate to way too many of the empath tendencies that I've seen described.

This has really affected my relationship because I used weed to stuff down my feelings. Every time I tried to quit, I felt like we fought more often so I turned it into a tool to help my relationship stay positive (thanks a lot, brain).

I'm at the end of day 3. It's been tough; a lot of tears and strange/catastrophic thoughts the past few days but how I felt waking up on the second day compared to how I felt the first made it that much easier. Day 1 sucked ass but day 2 gave me a lot of strength and encouragement. 

I wanted to post and see if anyone else can relate to these feelings, because I feel like I haven't met too many people like me in the world.

If you guys are out there, how do you get through the painful feelings? What techniques have worked for you? Tell me about your life and how you cope with the emotions, the good and bad.

Thanks for reading. I'm very grateful that this community exists, stay safe everyone.

I try not to check Reddit/social media too too often for my own well-being but I will respond eventually. Reading these comments feels like a healing experience for me and it's beautiful that because of this technology, I can connect with you. Good luck with your journeys!",28

Being that you can't exercise all day, every day; I find that once I get done with my morning/early afternoon duties and I'm sore, relaxing in bed; that's when I really have an urge to load a bowl. It doesn't help that the little devil voice in my head tells me I deserve a toke for all my hard work. I haven't given in yet, but I fear that I might if I don't find something else to fill up my free time. 

I'm unemployed at the moment, and I can't look for a job because I'm moving an hour away very soon, so it would be pointless for me to pick up a job just to have to drop it. What are some things you've been doing to keep your mind off weed? Would love more ideas other than things like watching movies/TV, because that's a trigger for me as well, even though I've been doing well so far.

Already feel like I'm having an emotional crisis regarding my relationship. (A story of two addictions) [long],"Hey all. I'm using a throwaway because my bf knows my main account name. Maybe this is more suitable for r/relationships but I honestly feel more comfortable with this community, and considering a lot of these issues stem from addiction I didn't really want to put it in there. I'm also not really looking for advice re: fixing relationship issues, but I definitely need to vent and write everything down to help me start processing.

&#x200B;

I've been smoking since I was 19. I'm almost 28 now. At first I would smoke occasionally, I was single and living on my own so it was basically just whenever I could afford it. Then I met my boyfriend, and with the extra income we would indulge in our vices daily. His was alcohol, and he is an alcoholic although I didn't realize it until it was ""too late,"" basically sunken cost fallacy making me stay. I was naive and thought I could ""change"" him, make him not want to drink. I excused the times he did because ""I smoke pot, he can have a drink.""  I'm sure he did what he could to keep me around, as I am younger and only had 1 serious relationship before him, which had become very physically abusive and was my reason for leaving. 

&#x200B;

We have been together since I was about 20. I've been high almost the entire time. He was drinking whenever possible. Our relationship was not the greatest, there were multiple bumps in the road and I should have taken my leave multiple times but didn't, because he never gave me shit for how much I would smoke. Shortly after we got together, my dad was diagnosed with a terminal degenerative illness so I'm sure this just exaccerbated my marijuana use and my dependence on my relationship with BF.

&#x200B;

Through the years, I've wanted to leave. His addiction led to him doing many abusive or manipulative things. My addiction led to me not caring, or downplaying the severity of his actions, or burying them and simply pretending they didn't happen. I am not innocent either, though my issues appeared much later in the relationship and are with infidelity whereas he's got a mark for almost everything from the very beginning--infidelity, verbal and emotional abuse, neglect, anger issues... Though I will say he was never physically abusive, I almost wish he had been for me to realize I needed to go. I regret thinking that there was a ""final straw"" I needed to look for, when there were red flags waving at me everywhere. I told myself they were only there because he was drunk.

&#x200B;

My father died 3 years ago and then I became pregnant almost immediately afterwards. I smoked every day while I was pregnant, though with much less frequency, to help cope with everything going on. (Thankfully, toddler doesn't seem to have been affected by this, he reaches all his milestones early or on time and is in general a very smart, well-behaved little dude) BF started drinking even more. He even showed up to the hospital drunk the day after I gave birth. He was drinking behind my back as I desperately tried to shower myself in my small suite bathroom while my whole body was in pain from labor, begging him for help. My mind kept telling me I was still ""trading off,"" heavily smoking while he drinks. 

&#x200B;

There was a day BF was drinking heavily, and he did something completely inexcusable. That was my ""final straw,"" and made sure he knew. We did break up for a short while. He started going to AA meetings. He still slipped from time to time, but I saw his considerable effort and decided to give him another chance.

&#x200B;

For the most part, he's sober. His current job requires that he be gone for weeks on end, but we speak daily on the phone and there have maybe only been two or three times I've suspected he was drinking in the year he's been doing this. He still comes home and wants to drink. Every single time I forgive a little bit, because he's off-duty and works hard, but he almost always takes it too far and makes me regret giving in. 

&#x200B;

I never demanded that he stop completely or I leave him again, because I was still smoking. If anything, at a higher rate than I'd ever been before as I was laid off from my office job last year and decided to go into the personal service industry just a few months before COVID19 so now I am effectively a SAHM. My consumption ramped up to the point where I would smoke 2 grams of oil or 8 grams of flower in a single week. How could I justify that ask, when I wasn't dealing with my own addiction?

&#x200B;

Recently I reconnected with an old friend I met before I was with my BF. The conversation was online games, I was speaking regretfully because it sounded fun but I don't own the system and it's expensive. They tell me they can get me one second-hand for a reasonable price. I started doing some math. In the 2 weeks before that conversation, I had spent $180 on weed/oil. That could have covered the system/game and then some. Even more math made me sick to my stomach. I've spent THOUSANDS of dollars on my addiction, and for what? Nothing but tolerance for the poor ways I've been treated, and similarly not treating BF with respect. 

&#x200B;

I've been sober for just about 2 days. I'm an emotional wreck. I don't have an urge to smoke, thankfully, but it feels like all the things I've been repressing and everything I KNEW deep down inside is just bubbling up and overflowing. There's so much I didn't deal with from the past that I was hurt from and I'm beginning to question everything. 

&#x200B;

The day before I quit, I told BF my plan and that I was disgusted by how much I spent on weed. He suggested I buy plants and grow instead (we are in a legal state), and thinking that he believed my main concern was finances I clarified that I just wanted to be sober and improve myself. He hem-hawed and I jokingly asked if he wanted to keep me high. His response was: ""You're more bearable when you're high.""

&#x200B;

That kind of just... stunned me. He doesn't want me to be sober. Even if it was a joke, it was an unsupportive one. I thought this last year was probably the best we've had, and then that one sentence gave me a moment of clarity. 

&#x200B;

He rarely wants to go do anything when he's home. He's on his phone playing some BS Candy Crush clone when we're trying to watch something together or when I'm dealing with toddler, zones out and lets me handle most of the work unless I specifically ask him to do something. What he DOES want to do is go out and eat, and drink. Or buy expensive meat cuts and come home and cook while drinking. Inevitably he ends up somehow cooking for HOURS when it should only take maybe 45 minutes. An entire 6-pack in the span of making and eating dinner, or a 12-pack in a night, sometimes even more. He stopped bringing home hard liquor because he knows that makes him an angry drunk, but beer is still an issue.

&#x200B;

He's coming home tomorrow for a few days. I'm not leaving him, I want to sober up and see how my sobriety starts playing into the relationship. Obviously this post doesn't paint either of us in a positive light, but there are still good things about both of us that we both love. We share a lot of interests and world views. I do not regret having a child with him, we both love our son very much. But I know now, in the back of my mind, I'm going to be analyzing and probably over-analyzing every little thing that happens.

&#x200B;

My decision to become sober has just opened my eyes to a lot of things I didn't want to acknowledge. If you managed to read this, I appreciate you giving your time to an internet stranger. I had been keeping myself busy the last few days with chores, but... there's only so much to be done, and after I cleared my physical space I felt the need to clear my headspace. I don't talk to anyone about these kinds of things as I have few close friends (thanks to weed and a toxic relationship) and I know I likely need to see a counselor. But for now, baby steps.

&#x200B;

Thank you.",6

Cant focus, very anxious but trying to keep a positive outlook","So I recently decided to quit smoking after I blew up on my fiancé over something she said that I couldn’t comprehend because I was high at the time. I didn’t realize until then but when I saw her crying after, I knew this wasn’t the person I wanted to be.

I value my mental health and I didn’t even realize how bad I had become. I started using marijuana because it was legal and fun. Then I couldn’t sleep without using it. Then I couldn’t focus without using.

It started out a couple puffs a day but quickly turned into being high 24/7. It’s affected my life, my work and my self esteem. I want to quit or AT A MINIMUM get it under control.

Now, on day three, it’s been the worst. I can’t focus for longer than a few minutes, I have no appetite, and the worst part, all my creativity is gone.

I want to keep quitting and really just need some advice from anyone who has shared a similar experience. How do I get myself back to normal? Most notably, I’m terrified of losing my creativity. 

I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I don’t really have anywhere to turn to right now for support besides my fiancé, but she has difficulty relating to the issue sometimes.

I’ve read through some other posts here and even if this has been answered before, I would love to be linked to resources or even just some tips that worked for others.

Before I relapsed I was clean for 17 days, and I felt so amazing (withdrawal sucks but how much energy I had made up for that big way). Been through withdrawals so many times it does not even bother me anymore. Only the smelly part because of all the sweat.

Regarding hashish you have pointed out that some Persians have become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the soul. How could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree, and by partaking of it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How could one use this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the blessings of the All-Merciful? Alcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of absurdity, but this opium, this foul fruit of the infernal tree, and this wicked hashish extinguish the mind, freeze the spirit, petrify the soul, waste the body and leave man frustrated and lost.[4]",7

On January 3rd, after a months long struggle with keeping my cool, I couldn't stop crying for long enough for my boss not to notice. I was out of it, and I was done. I called in sick the next day and would stay at home, working on my depressive episodes for 9 weeks. 

In that time I consulted several doctors, but waiting times would be very long before I could get any psychological help. I decided to do whatever it takes to fill my days up until March 27h, when my contract would end. 

Realising that I was depressed made me kind of relieved. I felt a lot less crazy all of a sudden. I was ill and had to get over this illness properly, so I did what seemed good at the time. Nothing else mattered. I just wanted to be able to work again. 

I set up a daily routine, got up early, got bread rolls every morning and all that, I felt good, but still had crying fits every once in a while. 

Since I wasn't doing much exercise I didn't really get tired, so I started smoking weed after a long break to regulate my sleep. It became a daily habit. I went from one joint before bed to 4 a day. I did almost everything while high at a certain point. 

Now as I'm typing this, I realise that this is probably the closest to 'drug abuse' as one could get. 

9 weeks and a lot of soul searching (and weed smoking) later, I called work to ask if I could come back for the last few weeks before my contract ended, but with the 'Ronas in the air we decided it wouldn't be a good idea, so I set out to find a new job.

Fast forward to today and I quit smoking weed for 9 days and cigarettes for about 2 weeks. I'm on my new job for almost 3 weeks now and I really enjoy it.

The first few days of not smoking weed had me pretty much not sleeping at all. I cried a bit here and there and got angry with nobody for no reason. Withdrawal is no joke! 

Now that I can sleep again, and my mood swings subsiding, the voice in my head and I were discussing having a good ol' smoke this Saturday.

Realising what was being said, I came to my senses and scraped the entire idea. I'm not going through this again. I am in a good place and I feel like I've never been this content and outgoing as I am now. Mary Jane has been a wonderful support, but my time with her is done. After quiting alcohol for good, she's next on my list of things that I will never want to use again.

Losing her made me cry while playing Animal Crossing. Nobody in their right mind cries while playing Animal Crossing.

TLDR: Depression > no sleep > weed > more sleep + addiction + no more going out cuz high 24/7 > new job > no more weed > no more sleep > final decision to stay clean forever",10

Although I made a decision to quit a couple months ago and was doing extremely well for about 2 months. I was working out every day and doing my online classes consistently. Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, this overwhelming surge of wanting to get high enveloped me. I have an extremely addictive personality which leaves me to little to no impulse control. In a span of about a week, I saw my 2 month progress burn before my very eyes. I ordered a Fake-ID, went on weed maps and bought a 100$ worth of weed and just binged for a good 3 days. Then my parents found out and hid it somewhere in a bush outside my grandmothers house. The next day, I couldn’t handle my cravings so I hatched a plan.

I stole my mother’s car keys, climbed out of my window on my parents 2 story house and jumped. I hit my hand pretty hard and scraped it a little. When I look back on that moment, I’m afraid about how I didn’t really care what happened to my body as long as I could get high. I drove to my grandmothers house and was scouring every bush, looking like a mad man trying to find it. I found it and drove back without my parents noticing anything. 

But after a few days, I had an epiphany. I went to the toilet and flushed away everything I had. I destroyed my fake id and put my mom’s car key back. But this was when I was high.

It’s been the 2nd day since “The Flushing” and I feel terrible. I’ve tried to quit before but after about 3-4 months I usually fallback into heavy use.

I want to smoke. I have been down the road of smoking every day for long periods of time and then getting completely sober for long periods of time. This is probably my 4th or 5th time to get sober again. I have noticed a lot of benefits. However, I have been getting depressed the past week or so. I remember the last time I restarted smoking I would only take a puff or two a day and it was so fun. I really didn't start having issues until I started sharing bong bowls with my buddy which eventually lead to me smoking personal bowls and it was all down hill from there.

Here's the deal -- I have been way more productive and clear. I have gotten so much shit done. However, I just haven't been having much fun. I remember the days when I would just take a hit or two I was amped to wake up everyday. I had fun everyday. Is moderation just an illusion though? I have never been able to maintain moderation without falling into abuse. I even commented on someone's post the other day explaining that I thought the definition of an addict is that they can't moderate. I'm interested to hear everyone's thoughts.

First of all - I would like to express invaluable gratitude for this group. I would also like to thank each individual for their contribution - you save other people's lives.

I started smoking marijuana at the age of 15. Most of the time it was ""normal"" recreational smoking.My nightmare began about 4 years ago.My younger brother heard the diagnosis - cancer. He fought a little over a year. At that time, dividing my life into work and caring for my brother / spending time on oncology, I was devastating myself physically and mentally. To help myself with relief I started smoking more and more. Most often to keep ""straight"". After my brother's death to fill the void.I was addicted (although I didn't know this yet). Since then, I pick up the goods every day after work and spend the rest of the day smoking. On weekends I smoke almost from the morning until late at night. I didn't see anything wrong with it until ...

At the end of 2019, my father ended up in hospital on neurology. The studies were merciless. 15 brain tumors. They gave him about three months to live. I think at this time I began to notice that marijuana ""took over"" my life. I happened to take my father to the emergency department, Stonedlike a pig. After my father's death, I couldn't stop myself from smoking. It took a toll on every aspect of my life. I divorced my wife, socializing without marijuana does not exist. Each of us knows the dark sides of this addiction.

At the moment I'm 25 years old, I'm a divorcee and I feel like a wreck. I spent most of my adult life smoking joints. From morning to afternoon I think that I should end it, the second half of the day I smoke and spit in my face that I still do it. Still somewhere between depression and suicidal thoughts.

I can't break free from this cycle. Every day I repeat myself magical ""from tomorrow"".

I have two questions from myself.
1. Browsing this forum, people mention their ailments after stopping marijuana (from irritation, depression and aggression to suicidal thoughts). How do you endure it? Will I be able to function normally at work?
2. Since I think about stopping marijuana, a thought often comes to mind - do I have to quit completely? Can I smoke once in a while? I don't know exactly how it works (like with alcohol - once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic)

Thank you in advance for all the advice and every good word. I am glad that there are people like me who are trying to fight for themselves and others. Thank you with all my heart.

anyways, the rest of the night was wonderful, like it always is with her. i set up my old wii and we played wii bowling.. blast from the past; right? it was really fun. i think today i’m gonna kick her butt at some other wii sports ;)

anyways, until later today... have a good one, folks!",5
2020-05-06 06:33:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gehjhr/day_16_and_that_little_annoying_gnome_in_my_head/,"Day 16 and that little, annoying gnome in my head.","This is me: 29 years old, weed abuser for the last 15 years straight, highly functioning addict but now on his 16th day of sobriety. 

It all started pretty early in my life. I don‘t know how or why but as soon as I heard of weed, I was fascinated by it. I really wanted to know what that feels like since pot-heads were always pictured as a bit slow but happy bunch of people. One day at school someone had some and I took my first drag on a joint. I felt nothing...it was joint number 3 a few weeks later that made my head go boom. And from that moment I wasn‘t fascinated any more, I was in full-on love with it. The numbness, the mellowness, the feeling listening to music it gave, the „coolness“ it provided...everything was amazing to me. From that day on my consumption skyrocketed to the point where I would choose it over food, activity and even sex. No weed meant I ain‘t coming. Everything revolved around being stoned or getting stoned. And there was nothing to stop me. If my buddy didn‘t have any, the next one did. And if that wasn‘t the case, I would board a train to the Netherlands (2,5h train ride from my home town) and would just buy it there. I would smoke anywhere anytime, all day, everyday. I didn‘t give shit about police or anything. Like a freaking lunatic or „rebel“ as I would have called it earlier in life. It was crazy. I even smoked whilst working and let‘s say, I didn‘t have a job were that wouldn‘t be a problem. You guys would lynch me if I told you my profession which is another signature under my „Declaration of Crazy“. I was highly functioning and did my job that well, that I even took care of the trainees and tutored big classes for it, all while being looked up to. And all while being high as a kite. Well...as high as kite can get after 15 years of daily weed abuse which is in fact not that high but pretty numb. 

It was on 4/20 this year when I had enough of it. I knew it needed to stop right away as I tried it multiple times during the 15 year period but always failed at the 3 months mark. 

It was always that, „well, looks like I got the hang of it now, so one little joint won‘t do any harm“...it was far from that. It never took more than two weeks from the „one little joint“ to be back to full blown addiction with daily abuse. 

So back to 4/20 2020, as I smoked the last joint of the day (Number 12 I guess), I emptied my stash into the toilet and flushed it. Believe it or not, I was in tears of grieve. It felt like my girl just left me. See how crazy that is? It was mental! But it was the right thing to do. 

The first days were filled with self doubt, depression and anger. No sleep, no hunger, no sex drive but a lot of sweat...rivers of it. But I managed to bite myself through that pile of trouble. It all got better day by day. Now on day 16 it looks like everything I lost along the way is back. My ambitions, my feelings, my hobbies, my sex drive, my hunger, my happiness and my will to do better in life. The only thing which is still bothering me is that little gnome inside of my head, telling me every now and then the same lie all over again. „Now you know how stop, so why not enjoy a little weed from time to time?“

But he‘s the devil in disguise. I know for a fact, that there can‘t be any form of consumption because I would‘t manage to leave it alone after just one joint. It would drag me back in an instant just to where I left before. 

I need to find a way to mute that little voice but you guys are doing a great job with it. Communities like this right here are doing me a great favor with all the positive reinforcement, you‘re providing. 

Thank you guys so much for all your posts and all the tips and even the mentioning of all the suffering you‘re going through. This makes me feel like I‘m not alone with it and it is a huge help to me. 

I‘ll keep you guys updated as frequently as I can to make sure, that I‘ll do my part as well. 

Together we can work this out, im sure! 

Remember, you are doing great and even if I don‘t know anybody of you in person, I‘ll be there for y‘all! 

United we stand! 

Yours thankful Satansböserzwilling from good 'ol Germany.",17
2020-05-06 02:43:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/geewky/day_9/,day 9,"finally got through a week and not gonna lie my time of the month has been testing me. i’m glad i picked up running a couple weeks before i quit because now it’s becoming even easier (as i am making my runs harder). 

i have always had to exercise first thing in the morning and could never find the energy to do it past noon. but tonight i took an afternoon nap after a busy productive day and had an insane amount of energy when i woke up, so i decided to go for my first ever nighttime run AND without a pre-workout drink. this was my longest run yet and the high i felt after finishing was BETTER than any high i’ve had from weed in a long time. 

normally on a day like today where i worked early (6:30a-2p shift), i would have came home and immediately gotten super high, ate a lot of food then would have passed out without remembering around 7pm, just to wake up in the middle of the night and have to smoke again to fall asleep.  

anyways just wanted to say how proud i am of myself and quitting has been surprisingly easy for me simply because of how great i feel. i know this is a long road and it will continue to test me but i know i can do it, and so can YOU.",2

I'm starting to lose hope. I think about how I wish I could smoke every day. I just want to be happy, and I wasn't even happy before I ever smoked. I just want to relax at the end of the day. Weed was something to look forward to, and now the days seem so bleak. I know it will probably get better, but I keep thinking about how weed could actually have been helping me with my racing thoughts and constant physical anxiety.

Now I'm on day 3 of quitting and everything about life seems so overwhelming. It seems like there are a lot of things that basically fundamentally make modern Life what it is that I was able to escape by getting high every day and not attending to these things. 

What tasks am I speaking of, you might ask? 

Literally everything. 

There's so much to keep up with in life. I know it's only been there days since I quit, but it feels as if my mental abilities and my ability to control my emotions has basically gone out the window. Taxes, learning new skills (trying, anyways), only living by what I can afford, dealing with debt, filling out job applications, everything about interpersonal relationships and communication...that's on top of all the damn chores and personal upkeep I was already doing. It feels like my brain is trapped in cynicism, resentment, and hatred, for everything about what life demands of me, not the least of which is that life demands I be sober and never ever get high again. 

I'm wondering, will I ever truly recover? Will I ever truly be able to totally accept life no matter whatever comes next? Will I ever truly cope with the fact that I can't get high and escape the demands of reality?

It feels like I have absolutely zero dopamine or serotonin in my brain. I mean really, when I analyze myself these past few days, it's really like that; when I wake up, the first thing I want to go back to sleep and keep harvesting the feel-good chemicals; when I finally wake myself up I either want to work out or go straight into the shower, possibly just a bath while I browse the internet; next thing all I want is a cup of coffee; after coffee I think about all the shit I need to do that day, but I don't do it because videogames, reading, or fiddling with my guitar are so much more rewarding; thoughts about my situation in life beget fear and insecurity; I try to teach myself new stuff but it all feels empty and insubstantial; putting myself to work makes me feel existentially bored and I fail to feel good about accomplishing tasks, focusing on anything or having deep intelligent though feels literally physically impossible etc., Etc.",4

I first started using weed heavy when I was depressed in college. Sleeping, eating and generally enjoying things was not something I was experiencing at the time. Though weed helped me through that period I eventually developed a debilitating habit that’s been hard to shake over the last 10 years. 

Every time I make progress on quitting it is downright devastating to struggle with eating and sleeping again. Eating especially. Food just sounds awful and chewing is gross and I hate the idea of swallowing. It makes my efforts to quit or even just cut back feel like a punishment and seriously hinders the motivation to push through. 

Yesterday I was hungry but still couldn’t bear the idea of eating. It was nice to feel though. 

Today, I am starving. I ate four separate meals! Little mini meals, maybe 300-500 calories each but still I ate and enjoyed it and actually ate more! 

Now as I’m winding down getting ready for sleep my stomach is rumbling and if I didn’t have a puppy and an essential worker husband I don’t want to disturb I would totally be in the kitchen grabbing a snack. Already scheming what I going to make for breakfast...

It’s crazy to feel hunger. Who am I kidding, it’s crazy to FEEL. What are feelings y’all???!!!! I am having them!!!!!

Before the conversation even began he asked me if I needed any weed and I said, No thank you. 

Weed has led me down a dark road where I pretty much sacrificed everything to get high. Weed cost me a great career, my mental health and my financial security. I’m now working a job but it’s nowhere financially near where I once was in life. I could have easily taken my friend up in his offer but I am not interested in going backwards and I’m certainly not interested in remaining stuck in the job I currently have. If I picked up today my life would once again be put on pause. Stagnation would once again rule my life, mired in apathy, being unproductive and unhappiness is what weed has given me. I want so much more out of my life. So today, I am proud for staying strong and on the right path. Each day is a challenge and I’m hoping I can continue to keep on this path.

7 years daily smoker (24yr/o) My 2nd attempt to consiously quit. Longest period of being clean was 2 months as I was not going to risk korean jail. (2yrs ago) now I have better reasons. 

Four months ago I decided to quit for the first time, managed 3 days, 5 days, and then a record of 13 days. 
Then smoked one bc ""Appearantly I can quit for 2 weeks"" so ""I'm good"". After that I fell back into the habit of 1-1.5 grams a day within a week. 

The first day was hell all over again. I cried, I hated myself, I didnt trust myself for a second to be able to perservere. Luckily I had the support of my girlfriend. I literally asked her if I could go and cry on her shoulder, which helped me through the first day. The bottled up emotions are so intense, it was great to let go. (She's amazing)

Day 2 was easier, the amount of cravings dropped by 80%. I already felt more productive and energized even though I had slept for maybe 30 minutes. 

Today is night 3. Almost day 4 as the insomnia is insane. Im shaking, terribly. Only thing I can do is keep my eyes closed untill I feel myself sweat, at which point I reposition, shake like hell, get hot/cold and repeat that cycle. So now I am typing this hoping to feel a bit of tiredness soon.

Long post... sorry.,"I've tried quitting pot before. Oh, I've tried. I've bagged up my grinders and pieces and fresh bud and thrown them out. I've done it several times. I'd just go buy new stuff a week later, spending even more money. I'd smoke through the flu, making things worse. For the last 8 years I smoked almost every day, even after a double hernia surgery. I've spent all of my 20s in a haze. I have a degree in piano and for 7 years I've wasted all the skills I worked so hard to develop. I have stagnated for 8 years on developing marketable job skills. I have spent 8 years chasing a neverending high and playing video games, and not improving as a person. 

My little sister died last year and she knew me as a pothead. She's the only one in my family who knew what I really was. I have held onto that loss so tightly that I feared ever quitting weed because I thought I needed it to retain my sanity and manage my lifelong hypochondria and anxiety. 

Friday night I wasn't feeling so great and went to bed early. The next morning I smoked a little weed and an hour later my heart began racing and I couldn't breathe. I thought I was having a heart attack. I'm perfectly healthy so I was very scared and went to the ER. I never ever go to the hospital so I didn't even know where to park. The doc told me I likely had an anxiety attack... and diagnosed me with pleurisy. My breath is short, and it's uncomfortable in my chest. It is only mild, but any time I tried smoking last week, I felt the symptoms - it took an ER trip to convince me to stop smoking. 

The last few days have been a nightmare. Although Tylenol is making the pleurisy much better and completely manageable, I am having a hard time adjusting to reality sober. I can't sit down and play video games because I get bored quickly. No weed? Can't sit there for hours playing Animal Crossing and Red Dead 2. Just can't think or focus. I want to be high, but I'm a lazy motherfucker who is still dragging himself out of addiction and can't bring myself to concentrate on active hobbies. I am laying in bed with insane hunger pangs even though I just ate.

I cannot remember the last time I was sober this long. I never want to go to the ER again. I just want the stomach pangs and discomfort to go away, I want my appetite back to normal, I want to have a zest for life again. I want to play the piano again and actually learn to enjoy things without weed again. I cannot enter my 30s living paycheck to paycheck, doing nothing with my life under the illusion that it's fine to just do nothing all fucking day all fucking year long. My best friend just had a kid. I do not want that kid to grow up and be more accomplished than I will be at 50.

I want to be free. I'm on day 3. I realize I'm addicted. I realize I will always be an addict. But I'm not going to be a slave anymore. I'm sick of this shit. It isn't worth it anymore. 

If you read all this... thank you. I just need someone to tell me it's going to get better. I'm going to try to go back to sleep now. If you have any advice... please give it. Sleep and Tylenol and bottles of water are my biggest friends. I just tossed out ALL my paraphernalia, again. Hopefully for the last time. 

I can do this. I know I can.

This past year was my worst year yet with weed (or however you want to phrase it) I smoked almost everyday, usually at night with friends and in social settings. However, I began to pick it up more and sometimes smoke before studying and trying to do school. Ever since quarantine started I hit my worst point and was high probably a week straight. This weekend I decided to stop. I have been wanting to stop smoking for so long, but always gave in and always was peer pressured to ""common lets just smoke 1 joint"". I never thought I would reach this point. Before my junior year of college, I smoked only 2-3 times a week and it was just more of special fun thing to do on nights when nothing else was going on. After joining a fraternity I noticed how much more I was surrounded by it and basically began to just smoke for no reason at times. I felt terrible after every time I did. I would regret it. Have a lot of bad highs and increased anxiety. I've have felt foggy for awhile and my brain has been slowing down. I noticed I wasn't able to focus much on school, and I go to UCLA where academics are pretty tough and felt as if I wasn't taking it seriously. I noticed in social interactions I would be slower, slower tone, and just functioning in general. Weed IS NOT PRODUCTIVE. But for some reason my brain would tell me it is. Every time I would clean my room or do dishes ""I wanted to get high before to make it more fun"". 

I just wanted to say that this page has  helped me so much. To see other peoples struggling with the same issues and notice the same symptoms with smoking weed really has motivated me to quit. With weed legal in California, it seems to have such a positive connotation and that ""its better than drinking"" and so on. Yes it is however it is still a drug!  When you reach a point too where you begin to google about it--thats when you know there's a problem. 

its only been 3 days since I smoked weed last and I feel so much better. I want to keep this up as long as I can and I made a bet with one of my best friends who also is trying to stop. Whenever one of us smokes we owe the other $100 bucks.. I know sounds crazy but I think its a good deal because it will force you to stop and not give in! because thats my problem and maybe for many other too. Its hard to say no when you see it in front of you. 

I want to be here to help others and lets all stick in this together guys. Love this page and community thus far and I just recently discovered it! 

Thank you so much everyone.",17

Here's the thing. I'm 32, have been smoking a lot for a long time, and yet have still experienced a lot of success in my life, am recognized for my work, get to travel the world, and have a lot of good things going for me. I have good habits, even as a stoner (meditation everyday, yoga). But I know I'm not quite living my best life, and have felt enslaved to weed. I also feel it's been holding me back in ways, my emotional state and moods felt unstable as they've been reliant on a substance.

I literally don't know how long I can do this though (I know I can if I persevere). Some days have been easy, but yesterday it's a miracle I didn't smoke, as the cravings were so real, and I was in a 'fuck it I'm not doing this anymore mode'. The trouble is, I know it's all or nothing. With alcohol I'm chill, in control, can take it or leave it. With marijuana, which I've been smoking since I""m 13, it becomes an obsession, I could happily smoke every morning, if i have something to do with others, I don't smoke but would think about when I'll be finished so I could smoke.

About 5 years ago I took a month off, and felt so good, it turned into 4 months without weed. That was literally the longest I've gone since I was 13 years old. Then I had a smoke one night with a friend, and within a month was blazing everyday again.

About 3 years ago I was fortunate to get to work online remotely (didn't have to go into work everyday). While it's been a true blessing, I began smoking every morning basically because I could.

I ran into a former student randomly, several months ago, and she shared with me how badly addicted to weed she was, and how she had quit a month ago. It felt like a sign and I felt comfortable opening up to her about my own addiction and have been thinking about quitting.

Then, as Covid-19 hit, I've felt this is an ideal time to make a change. Routine's been thrown upside down already. I'm only on day 12. It's really tough.

Any tips, success stories, benefits of life without weed for the long term are welcome, as wow, this shit is so hard.",4

The withdrawal process is debilitating but to me all the more worth it. I’ve always felt as if I made horrible decisions in life which made it harder than it should’ve been.

However I never let that thought determine my future. I wish I never touched the stuff at all but I did and I can’t dwell on the past just work towards my future. Although i hate paws ( post acute withdrawal ) with a passion, It’s helped me understand just how serious some consequences can be for ones actions. I’d rather be sober and be uncomfortable for a while rather than smoke away my prime years.

I've been smoking since I was 15. It became a daily thing basically immediately, it may have taken 6 months. I'm just so tired of it. All my friends have grown out of it, and I don't like most of the people I meet who smoke. I don't think straight, and I'm happy doing nothing for months on end. My emotions are fucked up and I really just feel helpless. People have been telling me for years that I should stop, that I'm different when I'm stoned, and I always agreed, but later. I've been trying to quit for eight years, on and off.

Eight. Years.

In that time I've struggled through 5 years of school without learning enough to actually do my job right. I'm a fucking physics teacher. When I graduated I knew I wasn't in a place to do well by the students so I work(ed) in a factory, a job I'm terrified to go back to in ten days. Take a guess why. 

Two nights ago I let myself run out of pot. Yesterday morning I woke up at 9:32 and the first time I wanted to smoke was 9:36. Obviously I was out, so I just started playing video games. Time ticked by slowly, soberly. Toward the end of the night I ran out of things to do (turns out 18 hours of video games a day is not as great sober), and I was getting itchy so I went for a walk and reflected on why I want to not be smoking all the time. 

By the way, I do mean *all the time.* Before corona, I would wake up, smoke, shower, smoke, get in my car to work while smoking, fabreeze up, work for 4 hours, smoke during lunch, work for 4 hours, smoke on the way home, and then spend the night smoking. I wish I were exaggerating. At the very least I would smoke 3-5 bowls a day. In the past year I literally smoked a pound to myself, all in bowl packs. It only went up until about a week ago.

So during this walk I reflected on why I smoke. Its because I feel better, and because it's something to do that takes my mind off it. Off the uneasiness and lack of comfort which permeates my life. There's something I'm trying to escape, and that something is everything. I don't want to live in this house, I don't want to be struggling to do basic work in my career, I don't want my degree to go to waste, I don't want to be too stoned to live my life. But it's easier to smoke up and play video games all day than to address it.

So I was on my walk, and I was out of pot. I go around the block, and when I get back to my house all I can see is the uncomfortable living situation weed has created in my house, not only between me and my housemates but between me and the life I live in there. I cried, I wanted to scream but I also didn't want to be the screaming long haired pothead on a walk at 11:30pm during a lockdown. So I walked on by and did another lap. I was calm the second time around but still uneasy, hopeless.

I went inside and sat down with my roommates dog for a few minutes and basically just cried into his fur, hes an angel. 

Then I scraped the side of my weed jar, my grinder, checked to see if my housemate had any weed I could steal (she didn't), packed a disgusting second hand bowl from stems, weed from who knows when, and likely a good amount of dog hair, and lit up. It was just as good as it always is. Comforting for the time. The whole time, I knew I would sober up and regret it, and yet here I am. 

It's been about twenty hours since I finished that bowl, and I've spent twenty hours going insane wanting to smoke. I don't even feel sober yet, I don't think I know what that is anymore, but I'm sure I'm getting some withdraws. I can't get a comfortable temperature and I'm sweating. My stomach feels tiny, all I had to eat yesterday was a bowl of cereal and all I could eat today was about 1/4 of a four egg omelette. That was five hours ago and the thought of eating more makes me sick. I'll eat tomorrow. 

It's so hard not to call my dealer and pick up, so I wrote this instead. This is one of the small steps I'm taking to move forward with my life, and it's important. I expect to fail a few times like I have in the past, but putting something out there that lays out my thoughts and intentions for the near future, getting something in writing feels more concrete and will hopefully put me towards sobriety. Maybe one day I'll be stoned and wishing I could not be, and I'll come back and read this. If I do, here's my message to myself: this is your truth you need to address, and you know it.

I don't know how to end this post, so this will have to do.",19

Growing up I always viewed myself as a self motivated and ambitious individual who used to take pride in doing the hard work or challenging myself with constant self improvement. 
Over the last 2 years. The years that I have been smoking everyday. My real life seems to have been destroyed and I now live in this world where I feel stuck repeating the same behaviors and I even have my own little daily routine when I am not working that’s based around weed and getting high. 
The past couple years my quality of life has suffered, i feel more isolated, less confident and I seem to always repeat the same self destructive behaviors I know I should be avoiding. 
I have even had consistent issues with my gf, and I always brush off the changes I need to make to actually improve myself and this relationship. No matter what stress or problems come into my life. I handle them all with smoking or with thoughts of getting high. 
I forgot what it was like to be more resilient, and confident in myself and the way I navigate through this life. Now i feel so closed in and trapped in this cycle. When I try to quit I always feel so irritated or anxious and need it to calm down even though I feel like shit after the initial high kicks in because I turn into a zombie. 
Guys what’s your best ways to cope with quitting? How long does the cravings usually last and what would you guys recommend to help me through this journey.

I'm going to bed with a full stomach and I'm on the second chapter of a book (I never read and I can even partially remember chapter one!). 

I have smoked north of 3gs every day for 11 of those 16 years, bar 2 when I was stuck in a hospital for a week - I had some delivered for the remainder of my time there. 

18 days ago I read the threads on r/leaves and they inspired me so I want to share my experiences so far and I'll be brutally honest. 

ITS THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE. It may also be the hardest mountain you ever climb but it's possible and its f$%k%&g worth it.

I've had two real phases so far.

1st: 

10-12 days of utter misery, depression beyond anything I've ever experienced (I've been in residential therapy before due to PTSD and this was worse). The anger and rage was unreal, the lack of sleep was physically painful and I resigned from my job in a tantrum and cut off life long friendships for good. It's unbearable and heartbreaking but each day I didn't smoke, or give in and I woke up feeling slightly more balanced. 

There were 48 hours when suicide was the only option I saw feasible. On these days, I took diazepam (Dr's orders over the phone) and slept. Perhaps I cheated but the alternative would have been worse- But... I didn't smoke. 

There were other symptoms I experienced but everyone is different.

Phase 2:

In the last week I'm definitely more irritable than I was when stoned but I'm calming more, day by day. My appetite is returning, and I've slept two nights for 7 hours now without it taking an age to get there. 
My sex drive is non existent and headaches are pretty overwhelming but my physical craving for smoke has 99% passed. Finally. I still haven't had one dream/nightmare though...  

I can say that today I have 'seen a light'. I feel like I can think more and feel more (in a good way). I'm excited about life and my future. 

If I'd given in and smoked, or hung myself, I'd never have seen this 'light' which I'm confident will help me through the rest of my recovery. As deep as it sounds, it really is so real and possible that anyone wishing to quit, no matter how long you've smoked, CAN. 

I've got a long way to go yet and I'm sure there'll be more phases as I progress to gaining my life back. This is new territory for me as a man and no longer someone hiding behind a joint. 

One thing I'd say helped me the most:

Whatever you feel, however dark and physically unbearable, DO NOT GIVE IN, no matter the excuse. Be it succumbing to sadness and smoking - DO NOT SMOKE and I promise, it'll get brighter. The first week, two weeks, might even even be longer for you, it will get better.

Now it's looking like I'll have my job back, and I can start to think of a wider plan. It's a tiny step in paying back the pain caused to myself for over half of my life but it's the beginning. 

I hope everyone going through this journey feels empowered by this community and I'm really excited for anyone getting their life back. 

You can do it. It is possible and your life will be the way you feel it should be. Its just that first step to see a brighter you and cut that shit out of your existence. 

Good luck r/leaves fam- I'm excited for everyone here and send you all the power and courage I can. 

You'll do it.

Hi guys (is this even how you start a post on here? Lol) So I’m new to reddit, well, I’ve been a lurker on the r/modernwarfare sub for a few months now but this is my first time writing an actual post.

I’ve been a weed smoker for about 7 years & started in my first year of college when I was about 17( I’m from the UK). It started out as something I did at weekends as a bit of fun, I’ve never been big into other drugs in fact the only other drug I’ve ever taken are shrooms. Anyway, I started smoking at a time when I was going through a bad break up, at least I thought it was lol. I became almost obsessed with the melancholy feeling I would get when I was high and thinking about my ex, I didn’t really smoke to forget her but to numb the pain I was experiencing. As the months passed by, I began to smoke more regularly and eventually became addicted. I wouldn’t say I’m the worst addict in the world, I have a Masters degree in Pharmacy and have achieved some great things in the 7 years that I’ve been smoking weed, but I’ve always known that I was addicted.

Whenever I was seated deeply in my smoking habit & smoking everyday (the most I would smoke in a day would be 1g, maybe 2g on rare occasions), I would become irritable, angry, emotionally unstable & would often disregard whatever it was I was doing at the time as quickly and as unsuspectingly as possible to go and get high. It became clear to me about 5 years ago that I was addicted, and I’ve flirted between quitting and smoking every day multiple times since then. The longest I’ve gone without smoking in these 7 years is just over a month, which was during a period of time leading up to my Uni exams in my 3rd year. Every other attempt has barely lasted 1 week & I’ve even continued to smoke through a few of my exam periods.

During my final year in 2019, I went to a book shop one with my mother and just happened to choose a book titled The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. I should mention that at the time, I was only smoking weed on weekends so was totally weed free during the weekdays. Little did I know at the time of choosing the book how much of an effect it would come to have on me. As I read through it I experienced the most profound shift in my consciousness which lasted for about 2 months and ironically stopped abruptly once I went back to smoking weed every day. During this 2 month experience I can definitely say that I was miles happier, more present, more patient, more kind & more tolerant of situations I would normally deem as ‘negative’ than I have ever been in my life.

Once I began smoking weed again this whole experience subsided completely and I returned back to my old, habitual and reactive thought patterns & I have been chasing this same deep, spiritual experience ever since, although I’ve never been able to get there again because of my addiction. Any time I’d try to re-read the book or try to become more present and mindful I’d do so whilst high, because getting high every day was what I did.

About 1 month ago I came across a version of the 12 Steps To Recovery laid out by Russell Brand, one of my favourite spiritual teachers. 2 days ago, I said enough was enough and I decided to quit & give the 12 steps a go! I’m working through one step each day & it’s actually really liberating and is a great way to keep reminding myself why I want to quit in the first place (alongside this sub), but it hasn’t been enough to curb my cravings & urge to smoke.

Personally, I find that my urges are strongest when I am bored, anxious, sad or experiencing any other emotional state which could be classed as ‘negative’. About 10 minutes before writing this post I’d been having the most intense cravings for over an hour and almost gave in, but I decided to try meditation for the first time & WOW! It wasn’t easy or perfect by any means, but I felt such a calm sense of connectedness afterwards, with no cravings or feelings of anxiety (which I have experienced in unusually intense bouts at least twice today).

Honestly, I’ve known for over a year that spirituality, mindfulness and presence are what bring out the true essence of my nature but because of my smoking habit, I’ve never been able to experience it like I did when I first read The Power of Now.. until now 🙏

If anybody would like some advice on how to get started on their own spiritual journey to help free themselves from their ego & their addiction, or even if you’d just like me to send a copy of the worksheets for the 12 steps, I’d be happy to do so. I feel like it’s only going to get easier for me from this point onwards and I’m so happy that I just had to share it in this lengthy arse post. 

Stay strong people, do not listen to your ego as it will try it’s hardest to prevent its dissolution and pull you back into your old, habitual and reactive thought patterns which pertain to your cravings and in turn your addiction - In time, your truest nature will show you the way.",2

It’d have to wait till tomorrow! Weed always came first.

Now that I don’t smoke anymore, I’m stunned by how much time I have on my hands, i’m adjusting to it but I’m no longer living my life on a countdown to smoking time. I have more time to work on myself and complete both responsibilities and personal activities.

I stopped smoking a few weeks ago and am determined for it to stick this time. 


Now onto the current issue. As in the past whenever i give up weed i seem to drink more. One reason is I was massively reliant on weed to get to sleep, and alcohol does a similar job for me. This always leads to me going back to weed because it doesnt give me a hangover the same way alcohol does and seems less unhealthy for me. 


It's been 3 weeks since I stopped smoking and have drank pretty much every other night (always leave it till the evening). Both my parents used to drink pretty much every night when I grew up so this seemed kind of normal to me until my bf pointed out how abnormal it is to do this to myself. I'm not planning to buy more alcohol for now but I know in a few days I'll have purposefully forgotten all the reasons why I need to stop and will convince myself I have more self control than I really do so I partly write this as a reminder to myself. Whenever I try this tactic I end up deciding to smoke instead.

Feelings are the perfect examples of this.

I've learned that cravings are too.

When you feel like you are having a rough day, don't automatically chalk it up to your lack of weed. Instead, just acknowledge the existence and keep in mind that you will not feel that way forever. Hell, you may not even feel that way 15 minutes from now.

That intense craving you receive when the thought of smoking enters your mind, if you can get past the initial impact of that feeling, you are less likely to act on it. Instead of filling that first few moments with potentially faulted reasoning/thoughts about your addiction......just know that soon another moment will come and so will another set of feelings/desires.",37

Any help is appreciated.  I look forward to joining the ranks of you who have successfully quit and moved on with your lives to be successful functioning members of society.",3
2020-05-05 11:57:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ge0cva/quarantine_quitting_day_5/,Quarantine quitting (Day 5),"My roommates and I are graduated art students who went to the same school. We used to bond mostly through weed and video games. They actually helped me through some of my darkest times and I’ll always be grateful for that.

It is tough seeing them act so functionally while being high. When I smoked regularly, I did it for the escape but it also dulled my motivation. I always knew I could do better in school without it but all my peers seemed to thrive on work, smoke, work, smoke and they did fantastic work from it. Made me feel lesser cause I never wanted to work stoned but I couldn’t help myself from wanting to be close to my friends. This was how most if not all of college was like. 

I’ve decided to stop because this quarantine has very much shifted my way of thinking recently.
Instead of thinking how little there is to do and how little control I have, I’m instead thinking about the things I could be doing if my mind was clearer like exercise and get back into making art again. I’m also just realizing that I think I’m just a more confident, enjoyable person to be around sober. I like myself more like this. 

With that thinking, I’m seeing my peers work as motivational again rather than making myself feel bad. I know I’ll never function as good as I am sober so why not try and make the best of this and come out the other side with more hope than before. 

Apologies for poor formatting and stream of consciousness writing. These are just pent up thoughts I needed to put on text. We’re together on this.


Edit: if it was unclear, when I said I saw their work inspiring, I meant more in terms of the quarantine and being able to keep normalcy even through this rather than feeling envy. If they feel they can function well enough and keep being motivated, what place do I have to judge them. They smoke for more specific reasons (medical, attention) as well so it is a bit inspiring to see them grow even through that.",4
2020-05-05 11:51:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ge08o9/thoughts_on_weed_as_a_coping_mechanism/,Thoughts on weed as a coping mechanism,"Today I am 18 days clean from weed and alcohol. Just wanted to share my thoughts.
I began smoking daily 3 years ago after about a year of struggling with my mental health. At the time I had insomnia, depression and suicidal thoughts. Weed was the solution. I found myself relying on it to numb myself and pretty quickly I was fully addicted. It started off in a positive way I suppose, I enjoyed being high and enjoyed getting high and doing some things. It pretty quickly became a necessity in my life however and before long I had to get high in order to do anything.

What I realised recently and what lead me to quit is this. While weed allowed me to cope with my life it did not allow me to get better. 3 years ago time stopped for me. I can’t fight my own demons while high and being high made me apathetic to my stagnating life. While bouts of depression were easier to cope with due to my constantly altered state they were also harder to fight. Not harder to live through but easier to ignore. For the first time in what seems like forever I have the energy and motivation to fight for myself. I will not stick my head back in the sand. I am sick and tired of being depressed and I reject it as my future.

Being sober has been hard so far. Of my 18 days sober I have spent around half unable to get out of bed. Even with some intensely bad days though I feel like the past couple weeks have been an incredible success.

Life is hard right now but for the first time in years I am excited to see what things look like in six months.

Thanks you for reading and I wish you all the best.",8

I never thought that would happen because addicts by default are resistant to change.  I didn't realize this because it took me 5 years to admit that I'm an addict incapable of temperance or responsibility in the consumption of pleasures of the flesh and therefore I must abstain from them ever to have the life I want. I always thought I wanted both but now I see the utter foolishness and futility of this desire, that it reflects the desires of my addicted self, NOT my true self, my genuine spirit.

I'm scared of waking up in 10 years and still smoking weed. I'm scared of ever going through any part of my life again in this apathetic haze watching everyone progress while I sink into depression and self-loathing.   I always blamed my depression on anything and everything other than my habits, for that I wanted to keep engaging in those habits because I believe they served me.  They only would have served me long-term had I properly exercised consistent self-control over pleasures of the flesh. Pleasures of the flesh aren't evil in and of themselves, however abandoning self-control to them is the real evil, one of the greatest evils that exists, as the destruction is discipline is the destruction of your spirit, soul, and life. They never served me, they only have destroyed me because they became not recreation, but my entire way of life, which is no life at all.  I have almost no motivation I'm next to broke and think of suicide constantly. And this is entirely my fault because I chose short-term pleasure over long-term happiness for nine horrible years. I refuse ever to let this be my life again!  Because if I wake up at 40 years old still getting high and still not happy with my life I doubt I will reach 50 years old before I take my life. Because a life unlived is no life at all, life without feeling your senses fully and fully experiencing life as it is, is no life at all.",18

He is much stronger than I am in all of this as he was on pills for a while and able to overcome that and really grow through therapy. 

We finally got around to really cleaning everything in our place after months of being too lazy and high to properly care for our living space. As I was cleaning the closet yesterday I asked him what we should do with all of our pieces and rolling trays.. he immediately said we should toss them. My first thought was to give them to friends who still smoke.. but I feel like part of me wants that so there is the option to get them back if we want to smoke in moderation.. but I don’t think I ever want to smoke in moderation. 

He struggles with realizing that and wanted to smoke to celebrate his new job last weekend. I did talk him out of it, but I don’t think he understands how bad this addiction is considering the others he got through were so much harder. 

I just don’t know what to do with the pieces because my mind says give them to friends because they were expensive and beautiful. However, I don’t want to lead him down a path where he does think we can do it every once in a while and not fall into old habits as we have before.

I decided to take a break from weed, and had a 6 day streak going. Had one of the best days this Saturday, and a friend came over who never usually smokes. She said she’d be down to try it that night, so it seemed like kismet and I figured, what’s the harm?

I ended up eating so much food, and woke up feeling groggy and slow. My point of this post is if you do relapse- I think it’s really important to take mental notes of how you feel after. I felt so much better in those six days of abstinence then I felt the morning I woke up after smoking.

This is what I will be carrying into next weekend. Remembering the relapse really wasn’t that great is helping me stay off of it. Thought this may help some out there :)",3

A passage I wrote to myself in 2015, shed light on a scared 20 year old boy, consumed with self hate and addiction. Reading this on the cusp of my 25th was the motivation I needed. I don’t want to be in this place when I’m 30. 

I have goals, to become a person to lead with my heart, instead of my ego. Become a father, husband, leader. My usage wasn’t going to allow me to get the best out of myself. 

I’m going on 6 days of detox, and I head into treatment tomorrow, and I have no estimated return time. 

To make matters more interesting.. I own and founded an up and coming extraction lab and grow facility breaking into the marijuana space in my home state. I used this for many years to justify my abuse. How could I have this occupation, and not smoke weed? (Personally I think it will empower me) I’ve had 9 surgeries since I was 17 years old, and had been riddled with chronic pain for years and also used this an excuse to abuse rather than to medicate.

Two days ago (4 days before I check into treatment) I was ordering take out food on my way back from playing 9 holes, and I began to blurr out on the busiest highway in the state of Minnesota. I don’t know how, or why, but I was able to pull over to the side of highway and I began convulsing. My fingers and palms turned inwards, my arms curled, my legs went numb, my eyes were twitching. ( I thought I was having a seizure). It was an anxiety induced convulsion attack. 7 seconds was the difference between life and death... I could have been going 70mph into a guard rail, another vehicle, or a semi. I don’t know how or why I was able to pull over. My left pointer finger saved my life, by punching the iPhone to call for help. I had looked death in the face at many points that day but something kept me alive. 

I have dramatically impacted the most important person in my life, someone who I want to marry one day. And although she has no reason to stand by my side, her strength has continued to inspire me to become the best version of myself. I have let go of the future, I have let go of us... in order to save me. 

I have received incredible advice and support, but none more than, confront my fear, and begin to lead with my heart, instead of my ego. 

I am thankful for life this week. Cheers to change, new beginnings. You can do it. You are strong. 

Much love.",8
2020-05-05 09:34:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gdxt2p/should_i_throw_all_of_it_away_aka_help_me_find/,Should I throw ALL of it away? AKA Help me find strategies to quit in this LOCKDOWN!,"Yes, I want to quit and yes I have tried and failed several times and still struggling. I might not have succeeded in fully conquering this addiction, but by fighting the monster, you learn and become a wiser general. So here is what I have realized so far in my quest to quit:

Addictions are the by-product of an unfulfilled and unhappy life where you do not have a purpose or passions. If you wake up everyday like a zombie, if each day is the same and if you hate your life, addictions will follow. When you quit, use that time to do something about fixing your life and set real small goals which serve as guideposts for the road you wanna travel. Without changing the external life in some way, you cannot succeed in quitting. Your life should not suck so much that the pain becomes intolerable and you need another escape.

Now, my personal life is in turmoil. I realized in retrospect that I wasn't an alcoholic or a pothead before I got married. I wanna get divorced and move out and start afresh. However, the lockdown fucked everything up and now no one is hiring, the city I wanted to move to is the epicenter of the outbreak, etc. I still have to live with her ""trying to save this marriage"" but in my heart I already know. This emotional turmoil of a failed marriage and still living in that toxicity is poisoning my soul.  

Inorder to find another job, specially the one I love and actually want to do (+ also will pay more), I still need to work on my craft. The recession wont last forever and as they say, some will come out of it with the most skills they ever had, the others will come out as alcoholics. I want to be the first kind. 

Now, I tried quitting and threw everything out except for a 4th I had left and two brand new vaporizers, one of which is still packed. I miss my friends from smoking (cigarettes) days because the strategy I followed to quit was to leave a couple of cigarettes with them. This made them much harder to get -- sometimes I couldn't go, they were not available, etc. and I could still feed my withdrawals if they got really bad. Knowing the suffering was only temporary actually kept me from walking down the convenience store and buying a full pack. Yes, I fucked up but those trips to the convenience store declined very fast. My past quitting experiences with pot made me realize that I get super pissy after day 7, and I am afraid that without any healthier alternatives and literally being locked up at home, without even the work outs I desperately need for my sanity, the withdrawals could really cause havoc, including turning my peaceful divorce to one of spiteful revenge. 

I am really torn if I should really throw it all away. During my latest attempt, I was able to control my use for the first 9 days, then started to get very angry, terribly missed my walks in the woods, etc. and decided to do it for ""atmost twice a week"" . Ended up with a 4 day binge (the experience of getting high actually kind of sucked after those 9 days). So while I fucked up, I am truly happy I stuck it out for those 9 days and braved all the pain.

Like I said before, I don't know if I can quit without changing my external life and with the lockdown in place, I don't see how can I change anything that would matter. Like moving to a new city, getting a new job, buying stuff that I want, taking a vacation, etc. to provide for a change of scenery. The catch 22 is that inorder to get this job that I want, the skill development has to come first or I will end up in another soul draining job as I know my limitations as a pothead. Without the pot, I can just fly and I have good grades in school and a solid track record of working hard and accomplishing things to have more than enough reason to believe that I can easily do it. Without the lockdown, the strategy would have been straightforward with this understanding -- have that last glorious farewell pot session, throw everything away in the bin and head off to a 1-2 month long vacation where there isn't any pot but other exciting things to do. Preferably come back to a new apartment and life where nothing remains to remind you of your old pothead self. But with the lockdown, when everything around you reminds you of the same thing, forget vacations, when you can't even go to the gym, etc. I feel the mental health is already challenged and I don't see another viable strategy.   

Please help me find some alternatives if you can. Please don't comment ""Just Quit"". That's like telling a farmer with a sickle to just go fight a knight in full armor. First off it doesn't work; Secondly, I want to give it up naturally like I gave away many of my other addictions. I've always found that if you just repress the urges, they become an unconscious monster that takes hold of you in a form you won't even realize. Most times, this just ends up switching one vice for the other. I got hooked onto weed because I was trying get on the NoFap bandwagon and without actually planning for it and allowing myself a healthy outlet as in sex, I just repressed it all for years and without me realizing it, I picked up weed as a substitute. When I gave up alcohol, I actually changed countries, got into a top school for a very challenging masters which just resulted in a ""Do or Die"" mentality. By the time that masters was done, my relationship with alcohol as an addiction had ended permanently. While I did get urges during this quitting phase, they were nowhere close to what I experienced when I was a full time alcoholic binge drinking whenever I could get my hands on a drink.

I do remember that I used to dream a lot before though, so I'm not sure if this is just how I am, or if I still have a chance of getting less intense dreams, if it's normal to still experience this after almost 4 months. Before I got sober I missed dreaming, now I find it exhausting and miss the dreamless nights (but!! I don't have the urge to actually begin smoking again)",1

Not sure how to feel.,"I've been smoking pretty much every day with a few 1-3 month breaks for the last five years. I didn't really notice any issues for a while but I've slowly come to terms over the last year or two  that it's making my life worse and not better: Completely insatiable appetite that I can't control making me sick, worsening my anxiety, destroying my memory (not sure how much of that is weed or the anxiety). I've tried multiple times to do the whole ""I'll only smoke once a week!"" but it always leads back to doing it all the time. I guess I finally have had to admit to myself that I might actually have a problem and I can't do this in moderation. 


I've also had to admit to myself at the same time that I don't have the healthiest relationship with alcohol so I've cut that out at the same time. 


My main concern is if I'll be able to stop completely for the sake of the health concerns I had used it for besides smoking recreationally. I have sleeping issues that will occasionally stop me from sleeping more than 4-5 hours for days/weeks at a time that really hurts my cognitive ability. I'd also used it to help with chronic pain on bad days which is what lead to me smoking once last week (I have multiple injuries that still cause me pain years later). I'm not sure how to determine if my quality of life is better or worse without it. I like being in control of my diet and being able to remember better but I'm worried about my sleep never going back to normal and having to resort to meds to manage pain if I can't tolerate it. Perhaps the issues with sleeping were exacerbated by not quitting completely before? How long did it take for sleep to get back to normal? I've been having a pretty rough time with sleeping this week which vivid dreams aren't making any easier.",1

I have smoked on and off for about 3 years.  Thus last time, I started smoking weed hard... like hard hard hard.

I can't afford it and I could loose my nursing license.  I had no motivation or drive to do anything other than to get high.  Now I quit cold turkey two days ago and I have felt the worst I have ever felt in my life.  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crazy bad restlessness, racing thoughts, insomnia, and a general weakness and ""tightness"" in my body.  I can't focus on anything... nothing.  I'm dehydrated and so fed up feeling so bad.  Why did I do this to myself again?  I went through withdrawal once already and it was bad.  This time is worse.  I need to know I'm not the only one out there struggling with quitting and these terrible withdrawal symptoms.  U need you guys to tell me it will all be okay and I will make it through.  I need some serious TLC.  My family has no idea what to do for me... I don't either.  I just know that, right now, the hospital is not the place to go due to the pandemic.  I can keep down small amounts of fluids today... even had half a nurti-grain bar earlier.  It's this restlessness and anxiousness that is just killing me today.

YAAY the longest conscious decision I've made to quit. Today the covid lockdown has been lifted in my country and I decided to go for a jog by the beach with my closest buddies. We all grew up together and they are stoners as well. After my run, I was chatting a while with em and the weather was perfect, cold evening with the presence of double rainbow. As expected, their response to it was ""this would be so much better if we were smoking a joint right now while enjoying it"". They also started discussing about this new dealer who gives a better amount and wanting to bulk order together. I declined although the temptation was real. I love this guys as they're my closest friends but the problem is that I've started realising that the topic that we always talk about seems to be getting high and most things that revolves around weed. I dont wanna stop hanging out with them but everytime we do I cant stop the temptations of thinking that a puff or sharing a joint with them wouldn't hurt. And they playfully shrug it off when I said I wanna quit for real this time. I dont blame them because I've told them that I'm quitting couple times before and always end up smoking again eventually. So they think I'm just going through ""that phase"" again. I know stopping hanging out with my stoner friends would be helpful for me as I wouldn't get reminded about it as much. Hanging out with them while I'm sober also makes me feel like I'm missing out on something and that we are not on the common wavelength. The problem is that most of my friends that I have rn are somewhat stoners. I dont want to lose these guys as friends because I love these guys who have been there throughout my life but I'm finding decreased topics to talk about since I'm avoiding the weed topic. Finding a new friends circle seems like an intimidating idea. Should I maintain decreased contact with them until I'm absolutely sure that my willpower is strong enough to be able to watch them smoke and say no even if they force me to take a puff? Thinking about it everytime I relapsed, it always starts with the thought that "" a hit or sharing a joint wouldn't hurt right"" and BOOM the next thing I know I'm buying again telling myself that I'd be able to control it.

I started smoking at the end of 2016, had my first joint with 2 of my high school friends and it was amazing at first, we would smoke once every couple of weeks when we had nothing to do, and that’s where it all began. We started to smoke more and more until our tolerance went through the roof. The fun dwindled away and now I was smoking Because I didn’t have a reason to quit and my major mistake was telling myself that weed isn’t addictive so I can smoke as much as I want. Fast forward 2 years and I found myself in a hole I couldn’t eat, sleep or even play video games without getting high because “everything’s better when you’re high” Once I got high I wanted to get even higher and that would result in me finishing what I have and having to get more. I would borrow money from family and friends just to satisfy my needs. I started to realise that all my motivation and ambitions no longer existed. All I thought about was weed and when I’m going to get high next. I became very timid and didn’t want so socialise with anyone even family, I would sometimes lay in bed for hours thinking about all the things I’m going to do Tomorrow to better myself but that all disappears in the morning because once again I start my day by getting high and forgetting everything I’ve said to myself until I get back to bed. It takes courage and heart to admit that something like weed has taken over your life and thoughts but the sooner you address that, the faster you begin to heal. The first few days will always be the hardest and the most infuriating thing for me was the boredom and having no motivation to do anything. I suggest you read books, go for a walk or even watch a movie. I am 11 days into my sobriety and I feel alive and full of hope.  we are not all on the same boat rather we are all in the same storm.

It all started in Grade 10 when I fell head over heels in love with a guy; who happened to be a weed dealer.. Bet you can guess how this ends haha. Before meeting this guy, I only smoked on occasion with friends as I had been since starting high school. However, I started hanging out with this guy everyday and I started to get into the habitual routine of smoking weed everyday. This went on for a year, before shit hit the fan and I started smoking batch with my weed. Fast forward like 3 years later, up until about a week ago I was still smoking everyday.  That relationship ended up being toxic and I moved to a new city and joined the reserves after I graduated.  I’m trying to pursue a full time career in the military, so I feel it be essential for me to stop smoking. I’ve cut down a lot the past week, only having a bowl or two at night before bed or with a buddy. Even just doing that, I noticed my body started to change. I’d wake up with clenching hunger and nausea. I’d sweat through sweaters and couldn’t get a wink of sleep. As of now, I haven’t smoked for over 30ish hours and I don’t feel terrible. I’m starting to believe that stopping is possible and I don’t need to revolve my life around getting high.  I want to start working out and saving money for the future. As for resources, I’ve been reading posts on this subreddit for quite some time. And just recently downloaded the app “Grounded”. I brought all my paraphernalia and weed to my boyfriends house in the town over so I literally can’t smoke unless I put in optimal effort. Either way enough rambling, I’m hoping this works out for me as I want to enjoy the future and find success within my army career.

I posted a couple of days ago on here talking about my experience quitting so far. Last time I mentioned the common effects I was feeling.. nausea, insomnia, extreme sweating.. etc. 

The day after I posted that, I woke up in the morning and actually had the urge to get on the treadmill. Did about 15 minutes of jogging/walking and OH MY GOODNESS. Exercise helps. Before this quarantine, my bf and I were heavy gym goers. Every morning at least 5 times a week we were at the gym before we really even had woken up for the day.. of course we would follow every gym session with a quick bowl. Long story short, exercising every morning has been a real help to get me through my day. 
It’s still kind of hard trying to figure out what to do with my day since I used to spend every day high enough where everything looked interesting.. but it’s getting better. 

My hands and feet sweat still, but I’m pretty sure it’s just the lingering anxiety I have from time to time. Last time i said I’m definitely not feeling 100% and I’m still not there. But the improvements are there. I feel so much better. 

Now if it’s one thing that’s been the biggest hurdle, it’s definitely the loss of appetite. After I get off the treadmill I can stomach some food but i always have this feeling that I’m just not full.. except when I try to eat, the nausea comes back. I know it’s different for everyone so i was just wondering.. when did everyone start feeling the urge to really eat again?

I only smoke in the evenings, in the garden, after i've put my daughter to bed. I maintain a good job so have persuaded myself that i am fine smoking. I have always suffered with mental health issues, mainly anxiety and depression, which i suspect come from untreated ADHD. Right now i am so low and wanting to smoke during the day, which tells me i have a problem as i know that i can't function properly when high so it would be counterproductive as i have slipped into a depression and i'm not eating or looking after myself properly. I make meals for my daughter but other than that i am useless.

I don't even know if this is the right place to be posting this, i just need help. I feel so lost but i don't have the energy to put the work in. I want it all to end. Is the weed making me feel like this or exasperating my feelings? I don't know who i am or what i like. Before lockdown i would come home from work and think about smoking. I couldn't wait for my daughters bedtime. I would smoke, eat everything in sight and then fall asleep - usually in my clothes.

How do i give up something that i don't want to but know i need to? It's one of the few things i enjoy.",6

Well I saved the post but it looks like the post is gone.  Does anyone know the name of the book? Was just about to buy it when I saw the post was gone.  I wanna say the title was something like took too much? I'm not 100 percent sure.  She was an addict with lots of drugs but she also talks about how weed was the last thing she quit.

TRIGGER WARNING PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

At some point in the 1980's, the precise time not important nor relevant to what follows, an unremarkable person was giving birth to an unremarkable child in an unremarkable place. 

The birth was a ""natural"" one and as sometimes happens, there was a complication during labour. Nothing extreme, but, without the due diligence of the midwife, the child would not have been born live.

That child grew up in a difficult home. That child was not happy nor thriving.

By the age of 13 they had already given up. Didn't see the point in anything. Cared nothing about anything or anyone. But, even without any faith at all, no belief in heaven or reincarnation or a new plain to go to, they cared not. They'd had enough. They decided to end their life. That child went to sleep that day smiling.

The child woke up the next day. The attempt had failed. No one even knew. The child just accepted their failure as yet another failure as a human.

By the time that child had reached adulthood they had no living parents. Both taken young and so the now adult continued on, empty with no guidance at all.

They'd already dabbled with substances but it was alcohol that filled that hole. ""Filled""

Some years later the now adult broke that hold from alcohol and continued on. For all outside to see, they were succeeding. They had a job. A relationship. They even sometimes smiled. Nothing had changed though, not inside. The smile wasn't real.

A few catastrophes later of which the details matter not, the adult was in the throes of addiction again. They had given up. Yet again they tried to end their life. Yet again they failed. Yet again no one even knew.

Some years later the adult hit an all time low. Every day they said to themself ""I want to die"" over and over and over. But, after failing previously, they didn't even bother to try to end it this time. 

They just kept going. They didn't want to but they did. 

Whether those failed attempts were divine intervention, the birth a miracle no one knows. Least of all, the person involved.

That person is me.

My addiction tore me apart. It also comforted me too. It's funny how that works...

I still don't know what my purpose in life is, maybe I never will, but after having so many second chances it's time I grabbed the world for all it's worth. It's taken me up until recently to realise how LUCKY I am.

I don't know how I'm still alive but for the fact I am? I'm greatful. And now, down the line a tiny bit and finally ready to face up to things, to feel and to heal? 

Even on the darkest days, I go to sleep smiling and hope that I wake up.

💛

(Life isn't always easy. Or fair. And not all days are amazing. For some people weed was a crutch, others a bit of fun that got out of hand.

I realised some time ago that if I thought about everything I am greatful for before I sleep I'm not so sad anymore. My health. My home. My friends. What's left of my family. My future. My sobriety too.

For those who feel like today is awful, you hate yourself, you can't stop that feeling of desolation, hold on. Hold. On.)",22

Felt like the last part of a breakup where you drop off their stuff.,"I couldn’t throw it away (4-5 Gs) and it had been sitting in a drawer. It’s been about 6 weeks now since I stopped. I would smell it sometimes. I would want it sometimes. When I went to give it to a good pal (trade for masks, score) I took a G out and put it back in, like 6x. Feels like the end of a prolonged breakup, where they finally get all their  stuff out of your house and there’s no going back. 

I’m dealing with a lack of identity at times. I’ve always been the chill stoner chick. Party animal. Always up for a sesh or beers or etc. I’m almost a year sober from drink and now, no 420 too. It’s empowering and isolating at the same time.

Sobriety can be lonely and sad some days, but it’s an investment in myself, with dividends. Some days the stocks are down, but they always rebound.",7
2020-05-04 10:24:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gdcipb/30_days_sober/,30 days sober,"I think what's scariest about weed addiction is that it’s gradual. There’s a stigma around substance use disorders, perhaps perpetuated by movies and shows. For me, addiction meant what I saw on Breaking Bad or Requiem for a Dream. Someone smokes, immediately falls in love, and keeps going back for more. Just like that, an addict is born.

What they don’t show is someone taking a hit and moving on their lives. They go through their normal life with occasional use, and slowly ramp up their usage. During this time, your mind starts rationalizing your decisions. “You’ve had a long day, so why not smoke tonight?” becomes “You’ve smoked all week but you shouldn’t have, but you deserve it because it was so stressful”. This feedback loop continues until you’re constantly making up excuses to smoke, which is what happened to me.

One of the direct consequences of this is that you become lazy and apathetic. I did some introspection into opportunities I missed out on. All those nights spent smoking and doing nothing but binging Netflix until 2 am. Those times I thought about doing some self- improvement, but opted to smoke and watch Youtube instead. Those times I said “No” to an outing because I was “too high” — I mean, the ‘Stoner Anthem’ of “Because I Got High” literally sings about this.

I used to think this was all normal, that people can get lazy at times. I was always amazed by people who seemed to have their shit together, to be able to work toward their own goals in life.

I won’t sugarcoat it, it was a coping mechanism. I was using weed as a scapegoat and a solution for all my problems. My “laziness” was what was preventing me from getting better grades, better jobs, a better life. I would smoke more to make myself feel better about the ‘unfortunate realities of life’. It helped me with anxiety, while also perpetuating it. I was a cannabis ouroboros, feeding on my own lies and habits.

It took me too long to recognize the impacts of my weed usage. Canadian Addiction Survey estimates that approximately 1/3 of adult cannabis users suffer from symptoms of Cannabis Use Disorder (Source). It’s a pretty common thing. Whether you realize it or not, it might be impacting your life. I urge you to take a step back, and reflect on your marijuana usage. (Or don’t, it’s your life)

Today marks a month since I said goodbye to cannabis. The first two weeks were hard. It was filled with anxiety and sleeping problems. My mind was constantly filled with “this would be so much better if I were high”, and I fought hard to keep that urge down. Maybe it’s too early to say what impacts it’s had so far, but I started to see change.

I started being productive when bored, a space occupied by smoking.

I started dreaming, something I haven’t experienced in so long.

I started to find joy in learning, a mindset disrupted by smoking.

I started to live life, something I’ve forgotten for so long.",24

This quote from Virgil's Aeneid has always given me comfort, and has been on my mind since quitting. Rather, quite literally in my arm.

Throughout different periods of my life, it has seemed as a constant reminder, that no matter how bleak, impossible, perilous, the future may seem, that there is a way forward, and only one:

By focusing on what is immediately in front of you, the next few seconds, not the ultimate result, and pushing forward with abandon, you may, just may, make it through to the other side.

While this has held different meanings at different times, to me, I find it particularly speaking, currently, to the addict in me.

If I focus on the future which I can not yet see, filled of pain, uncertainty, and failure, I will fail. But by focusing on battling the cravings, the withdrawl symptoms, as they come... as they are immediately in front of me, not before or after... There is a chance, be it a slim one, that I will survive.

Further, by accepting that there is no hope, no chance of survival, one fights with a fervor not otherwise possible, for once you no longer worry about your safety (comfort / familiarity of intixication in terms of addiction) You will take actions that would otherwise not be possible.",3

Finished up a morning workout, checking my emails and replying to notifications I missed from last night, because I slept early on a Sunday night. Got some music playing in the background, and planning on doing some studying later before going on a grocery run real quick. 

A month ago, I wouldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams I could be this kind of person. A month ago, I was up until 4am smoking a joint, ordering McDonald's for delivery, and wondering where it all went wrong. A month ago, I was stuck in the Sunken Place, knowing I had to rid myself of my weed addiction, but either too lazy or too desperate for the high to quit. 

The first 2 weeks after I decided to quit right before my finals began were fucking hell. I had night sweats, super vivid dreams that ruined my sleep, body aches and pains, chest tightness, shortness of breath...I literally thought I was dying from either coronavirus or the withdrawals. 

I'm now looking back on that month, asking myself why the fuck didn't I take the leap sooner? My brain feels almost normal again. I almost feel like myself again, except an even better version of me because I went through the mud and came back out wiser, happier, and more motivated than ever before. 

I promise you, you can do it too. I smoked several J's a night for the better part of 2 years, depressed as fuck and not knowing who I was anymore. I hope this motivated some of you who are scared to try quitting, I hope this encourages those of you taking the leap, and I hope this resonates with those brave souls who are on the same journey as me right now. We're all in this together! We got this! Life really does get better, I promise you.

Didnt want to make this too long that everyone is like shut up but I'm going for it. How the hell do you stop smoking during lockdown? I am trying, I was doing yoga, little jogs outside, but my willpower always gets the better of me and I end up getting weed smoking a joint. It has been about 6 years smoking everyday/ every other day. I had my first joint at the tender age of 13 and was on and off until it became a daily habit.

I am at the point it is affecting my day to day life, my memory and smarts aint what it used to be, I'm only 20 and I feel my head should be clearer than what it is, I find myself picking buying weed over paying rent or electric bills. Choosing over food or weed. The sheer amount of money I have wasted on this habit is unreal and I could be in a completely different place without weed. There are jobs I want to apply for but my habit would stop me. 

Its not even that I get high like I used to, it isnt the same thrill, it really is just to eat sleep and because I feel there is nothing better to do. How do I gain the motivation to do tasks, how to I beat the cravings, the mental effect of withdrawal, how do i do it during this lock down???

I am more determined now than ever to quit and get my life back on tract and gain that control over substance, be able to say no, be able to go a period of time without being tormented by the constant want for weed.

Theres limited resources, help, places to go, people to see. You are so limited it feels alot harder when there isnt work to go to every day, you cant get up and go to the movies or the gym or the shops for the sake of it or at all.

I've been struggling with depression for probably half of my life. I'd been covering it up with weed, wrapping myself in the warm blanket of stupor every night for almost 7 years, just to wake up feeling either nothing or the worst feelings imaginable. I have tried quitting several times, but always ended up going back, because I didn't see the point. Now I do.

Smoking just made me so much worse. It made me stagnate for years and I let depression take over all of my thoughts, my actions, my whole personality. That is now over. Ever since I stopped using, I have felt more energetic, more motivated and simply happier.

However, I feel like the honeymoon period with sobriety is over. It's no longer exciting to be back in control and the normality of depression is setting back in. I feel like shit in the mornings regardless, every day in quarantine feels the same. I'm lonely, haven't felt loved in an eternity and I can't really put this new mindset of mine into practice. It feels like I'm going nowhere. I'm doing everything I can, but it's getting harder every day.

Still, I'm not going to smoke. It's not worth it, never has been. It would only set me back and I would have to start all over. It's hard. And it usually gets harder still. But I can do it. We can all do it. I believe in us.",28

Sorry if I can’t exactly explain how I felt in **that moment** I’m trying my best to put what I felt into words but it’s very difficult! 😁","Hey leavers, first post here! (23M) I recently quit smoking weed (cold turkey) after a good 9-10ish years of daily use on April 24,2020. I smoked about a gram to a gram and a half of concentrates on top of the average 2/3 bowls daily. 

I’ve been clean for a week and the first 4/5 days were a literal HELL. I had almost every symptom I could find on this sub, (insomnia, cold sweats, NAUSEA, constipation, indigestion and very bad anxiety.) and it really helped me realize I am not going through this “alone”. 

On a positive note, about 3/4 of the way through day 8 and I no longer have physical symptoms I.e. nausea, constipation, cold sweats, or insomnia. I figured the physical withdrawal symptoms would be around for much shorter a time then the psychological effects. And damn was I right. Things that really helped me with the physical symptoms were hot baths/showers, steam rooms, orange juice and some pretzels. 

**My only question to you all is this, is it normal to not feel like you’re aware of certain aspects of your everyday life? For example, I was playing video games today with some friends (having a great time), and I caught myself literally SPACING out. Not just the normal space out where you catch yourself and snap back into reality, it was almost like I was in a trance. After that I experienced a major headache and stress. It went away within an hour or two but I literally couldn’t do anything but lay down in the dark until it passed.**

P.S. Thank you to all of the leavers before me for helping me understand what I am going through and realizing it will all be okay. You guys ROCK, keep up the good work!! And to anybody else thinking about quitting, YOU CAN DO IT!!! Believe me, I never thought I’d see a day where my head actually felt clear and normal. 8 days later and I’m feeling amazing other than the spacing out. 

Hope everyone had a GREAT Sunday and is staying healthy throughout this pandemic!!",5

This is my first weekend without smoking - it’s been years since I’ve gone a weekend without it. I accomplished a lot. More than I have in months. I fixed my road bike and went for a few rides, changed my fiancées broken iPhone screen, took apart a broken tv and ordered the replacement boards, fixed my car door handle, and cleaned my car inside and out. I felt really good. While cleaning my car, I found a roach. I didn’t have the willpower to throw it away, so I put it on the dash for later. I was wiping down the dash and moving some stuff around and accidentally knocked the roach down into the defroster vents, totally out of reach. For a minute, I felt grief because I wanted to smoke it, but then, it felt as if a rock had been taken off of my shoulders. It was a sign. I don’t need weed. Weed needs me. Goodbye my friend, it’s over. Hello goals and accomplishments, I have missed you.

After about 4 years (I’m 22) of on and off smoking and I decided to kick the habit. I think I realized I had a problem when it had been well over a year since I started to talk to my friends about wanting to quit. I would go a few days or a week at a time before I just fell back into the same cycle. I found reading through this subreddit has been incredibly helpful and didn’t realize there were so many people out here that felt the same way and had the same problems. I’m low key tired of how much the people around me glamorize weed and think that heavy use has no repercussions.

Anyways....I’m currently on day 7 of no smoking and have generally been doing pretty good. Sleeping has been an issue and just generally my emotions have been at times hard to handle. I find myself getting annoyed at the tiniest of things. It also doesn’t help that I’m quarantining with my girlfriend and her roommate who both smoke a lot. They both respect that I’m quitting and are happy for me, but it’s been hard just having it around. A few hours ago I got real mad at myself over something really stupid and almost cracked and lit up a bowl. I’m really glad I didn’t but I just wondered if anyone had any advice for how to deal with having it around and still finding the willpower to not smoke. I keep telling myself I don’t want it, and 99% of the time that’s true, but I’m just worried that in a moment of weakness I’ll hit the bowl just cause it’s right there ya know?

I got into HVAC service and had a portable herbal vape I’d rip on between jobs and on roof tops. I saved enough for a house and started growing my own to eliminate the financial burden of my habit. By then I got into a role as a service tech at a manufacturer of HVAC equipment. There me and my buddy would drop dabs on break and troubleshoot controls over the phone and email.

I mean the longest I made it was, I think a week? I don’t even know, I always lie to myself and the people supporting my quitting. I lie about how many days I’m clean; even I don’t even remember! It seems like, if I’m honest, I can definitely say I’ve made at most three days clean of weed in the past two years. I was so deeply engulfed with smoking it was my life, my living, At my worst I was smoking ... a day,

Ya know I wanted to post the real amount I smoked, but it’s like I take pride in it, take pride in how smoke I could smoke. I have had that “I can smoke more than you” attitude. It was encouraged in my friend groups and I was probably the he lost guilty. But as time passed I came to realize a lot of those “friends” were just as engulfed as I was. They were not committed to themselves and their goals, if they had any, they, like myself, were just committed to smoking more weed. 

It’s been like this for a while now, I’m sorry in and out of the mindset of even wanted to stop smoking. I find it hard to stay inspired. I realize now I need to change my mindset, on why I want to quit, why it’s important to me, I often choose to forget it seems like. I’ve seen through posts on here and elsewhere that meditation can play a key role in those first steps to making the transition to a better lifestyle. I suppose that’s where it starts.
My life is chaos, yes there’s a balance to it, a balance I have to find along the way, each and every day. Scheduling a real week and even month is something I have also heard can play a key role in maintaining a healthier lifestyle and happiness! Which I guess will lead to me quitting? I find that even with all the information in the world, on how to quit, how to take those first steps in the journey through counseling, NA meetings, Accountability through friends, loved ones, significant others, etc I still fall back into temptation and eventually regret. All of those methods out there I’ve tried, at least that’s another lie I tell myself to keep smoking. But I guess it all comes down to me. Do I really want to quit, and why, why is it imperative I do so. These questions and my answers to them keep me up at night. The constant lies I’ve told myself over the years, I can’t even trust myself. Depression is a new challenge, I’ve never thought I’ve had to face, but I feel, it’s grip over my mind every day, in how I talk to others, the mood swings, panic attacks(of which I’ve never felt, or understood, until recently).

Long story short I’ve just got one thing to ask to y’all veterans out there. How did you struggle with finding your motivation, what was the final straw that changed your life. Or was it a needle in the haystack, something that you’ve had to fight for, with ups and downs(relapse). I need the courage in myself to make a change and control my life again.

Much love to all y’all out there. Keep to your goals, remind yourself of the importance of quitting and what it means to you. I’ll try to the same. Stat strong, and well stay clean together.

I got drunk and stoned all night Wednesday. Then smoked weed all the following next day. I could feel it start to get a grip on me again, even though i didn't really enjoy being stoned anymore. 

I realised that it just isn't for me anymore, I've simply outgrown it. I've outgrown my addiction.

That's not to say i couldn't of easily become addicted and started an all day everyday use again, i could feel it creeping up.

So at around 11pm, last Thursday, i flushed the last half a gram and was done with it.

I have been an almost daily weed smoker for about three years. I am 23 and don't want to continue living my life this way.

I picked up this habit in college and noticed that I could get high every so often and still exceed in school/work/socializing/etc. But my senior year I entered a really dark depression that lasted about two years, and during this time I would cope by getting high every night, with or without people. I learned to love smoking alone, vibing to my own music, being more creative, etc. I have a high-stress technical job (and in college was preparing for this job with high-stress technical classes) so it was always a way for me to shut off my brain for a little.

But now, I feel it has made me unmotivated and anxious. In addition, I am now taking two antidepressants and a sedative for my ADHD (which has only gotten WORSE with my time with cannabis) which I really want to help, so removing this variable of marijuana may be useful. I also miss when cannabis was special to me, getting high with a boy for a super romantic night or with a group of friends to reach a new level of connection... it dissipates when you do it every night. It's not special anymore. 

Lastly, and probably most importantly, I miss dreaming. I haven't remembered my dreams in so, so long.

I live alone so amid this quarantine, I've been using it to cope. Today I challenged myself to go a day without it and wow am I bored. I usually get high, roll around and do nothing until I pass out and go to sleep. Looking back at it, the only reason this is entertaining to me is because I am high. So, doing that sober is not nearly as interesting.

I really, really want to get to the other side of this addiction. I'm admitting I have it, and I want to work on it. I'm doing really well with my mental health but this is one barrier I have been unable to overcome, but wow am I bored without marijuana right now.",117

There’s a void that is more apparent some days than others. Today, it was on full blast. Obviously this whole pandemic doesn’t help and I wonder how much this lack of fulfillment just stems from that...but regardless, the void is there.

But really, weed doesn’t fill this void. I’m done making this same mistake over and over. I know smoking weed will just lead back to addiction like always, and then there’s a much bigger void - I won’t really be living life and will just be high all the time. When I’m high, I want to be sober. When I’m sober, I *sometimes* want to be high, especially lately, but it’s also really amazing and fulfilling sometimes.

It might be hard now. Today was my hardest day in a long while. But a day is just a blip on the radar. Enough of this hollow instant gratification - I need to think for the future. And two years from now, if I continue on the path I’m on now and really achieve a lot in the time I’d ordinarily be high all the time and not present, then the void will surely be filled.

I came across this page during my endless search on how to deal with withdrawal. I’m currently on day 5 of no weed whatsoever. The first 3 days were so rough. We’re talking no sleeping, no eating, constantly feeling uncomfortable. The worst part about the night is the night sweats that I didn’t even know were possible. I don’t sweat that much in general so being constantly damp was something else. I’ve tried to stomach some solid foods, but I haven’t had much luck other than saltines. I practically live on water and Gatorade and the occasional smoothie that makes its way down.

Long story short, I needed a change. I didn’t start smoking until a little over a year ago. I had never smoked growing up but I was at a stressful point with my career and needed something to really help me relax. So I started smoking every now and then. It turned into a daily thing. I would smoke as soon as I got up, before every meal, and basically whenever I really was just bored. It became a habit I was falling into. It was getting harder and harder to get higher because my tolerance was constantly increasing. I consider myself a pretty outgoing person. I’ve never had an issue going out or hanging out with people. What no one Really let’s you know about weed is that if you become dependent on it, you use it and become more content without really doing anything at all.. to the point where you just stop doing everything you used to. I was an empty shell of a person using weed to cope with my anxiety that was always there. 

So here we are. DAY 5. I don’t feel 100% heck I don’t feel 75%.. but I do feel better than day 1. Things are much clearer for the first time in a year. I’m so optimistic for the future and for what I’ll be doing instead of smoking. I know I just need to get past a couple more days or weeks. I do have a fear of sleeping because I know how uncomfortable it is and I have an even bigger fear of throwing up everything I try to eat.. BUT I will keep going. I know it will get better. 

Reading everyone’s stories on here has been such a big help for me. I know some people get anxious reading them but I find so much comfort knowing there are other people trying to kick this habit as well. Good luck to everyone on this journey. It’ll be so worth it when we get to where we want to be you guys!",9

Turned out to be synthetic. I didn't eat or sleep for days and checked myself into hospital.

They had me on anti psychotics for 6 months and thought I was fine, stopped seeing me. Well I recently got my medical weed card in Australia and spent a fortune on weed and my dad is pretty sure I spent like the last four days in psychosis. I don't think it was, I was just high and he's naive to what being high is like, but I think it's time to pull the plug on it.

The annoying thing is I do other drugs that are much worse like oxys and they don't get me high. I do lyrica and my tolerance is ridiciulous where I won't get high. I've got vyvanse (hopefully soon dexamphetamine) and use that as instructed, not to get high or  I get really uncomfortable.

So now that I suffer from psychosis and can't do the old ""I'll quit one day at a time'' approach, how should I quit? I've got an inner desire in me to get high that I can't rid.",2

Any advice?,"Thank you so much to everyone on this subreddit for giving me the motivation and power to stop. I love you all! So a little bit of background 
I’m 22 and have been smoking daily since I was 18. I’ve stopped a few times before (longest was 4 months and this was after my flat was raided because my neighbours falsified that me and my flat mates were dealing (we were just smoking all the time and they hated the smell) and therefore had to have a drug test by my university. I’m a medical student and I have one year left before graduating. I always maintained that I would stop by my third year (4th year now). Telling myself that I was going to stop freed me of the guilt I had when I was smoking, especially since most of my peers (apart from the very few fellow stoners I had befriended) looked down on my smoking habit and made me feel like I didn’t deserve to be doctor. Last time I stopped it was very different as I was only stopping to pass a drug test and I felt like my freedom (to smoke) had been stripped away from me unjustly. Since then I’ve made a lot of progress as I’m now in a position where quitting is a personal choice. I know that having the opportunity to help other people is worth so much more than the numbness being high gives me so this time I’m stopping for good! I’m 3 days clean but I’ve been crippled by waking up in the night feeling absolutely confused to shit. I have nightmares that don’t even make sense and they leave me in such a vulnerable and scared state. I wake up in a semi conscious state not knowing what is happening and my inner devil tells me that the easy way to end this is to smoke but after everything I’ve been through and thanks to this subreddit I know better. I’ve seen some really helpful posts on here which deal with sleep but they seem to focus on falling asleep (which I still struggle a lot with but don’t mind anywhere near as much as the confusing nightmares). Has anyone experienced this and do you have any advice. When does it start to get better and is there anything that might help.

Hey everyone! So I've been smoking since 2010, daily smoking since 2012 with a few tolerance breaks here and there.  I'm currently on day 73 of being sober.

 In the first week or so I felt great, clearheaded, motivated, etc.  Here I am, a little over 2 months into sobriety and about 1 month into quarantine. I decided to go for a drive today and noticed my coordination was a little off.  

It might be worth noting that I'd been feeling this way for about the past year or two while smoking, but I always thought it had to do with my consumption.  I thought my coordination would come back once the weed was out of my system.  I bought an over the counter drug test and I passed, which is why I'm surprised I still feel this way.  I've been doing a lot of walking/jogging since in quarantine and I notice I have difficulty walking straight a lot of the time (not that I'm walking all over the place or anything, just not very straight).   It's almost like I'm a little bit off balance.

My brain fog, while not as bad as when I was consuming, is still around.  I still trip up on my words and have difficulty concentrating.  It's really discouraging since my first week sober felt great.

I’m 18 years old and around this time last year I formed a habit of smoking weed everyday. Over the months I started to realize that I became quite psychologically dependent on it and my tolerance became really high as well. Recently I’ve felt sort of ‘burned out’ from smoking but still continued to do it. It just wasn’t as fun for me anymore. I quit nicotine a week ago and decided 2 days ago it would probably be a good idea to take a t-break as well. I’ve been off of weed a few days now and I must say it’s not nearly as hard as quitting nicotine but I guess what I’m trying to ask is, should I stop for a period of time or quit for good? I’ve never experienced a long t break since becoming a habitual smoker so I’m not sure how much harder or easier it becomes. It would be nice to enjoy weed every now and then (especially with a low tolerance lol) but I’m just not sure how easy it is to relapse after quitting for a period of time. I know every brain is neurologically and chemically different to an extent but some advice would be great. Weed was the center of my everyday life for the last year and I don’t want that anymore. I don’t want to just look forward to smoking weed. I’m glad I came to this realization now because I recognize that many people have been doing it habitually for many more years daily than I have so their psychological dependence was probably stronger.

This is partially due to tax returns and unemployment (one of the great ironies of quarantine). However, I am certain I would have purchased an absurd amount of THC related products and snacks in the last five weeks. Instead of buying weed I have bought - a TV, a Switch, an electronic drum kit, an appointment to the optometrist + new contacts, and a few games. All of that and I still have more money saved than ever. I was always in denial about how much money I was really spending on weed, dabs, edibles, etc.

2) I don't have to stop and double check things like making sure I have my keys, wallet and phone. I just know I have them. Additionally, I always remember whether or not I have taken my medication. I used to really struggle to remember if I had or not and sometimes this would lead to double doses.

3) I don't walk into rooms just to realize I don't remember why I walked in there.

4) I don't forget things I planned on saying in the middle of a conversation.

5) I haven't weighed myself but I definitely look more defined.

6) I have been consistent with guitar practice and vocal warm ups. I am a music teacher and a guitar performance major and these are two things I take very seriously. I have passed some pretty big land marks in the past month or so including: mastering chord substitutions, understanding/memorizing the shapes of modes, and I can tell I'm at the top of my game with speed and accuracy. For those who don't know, high level guitar playing has a lot of athletic elements to it and that shit goes fast when one is not consistent.

7) I have taken care of a bunch of errands I had been putting off -- enrolling for next semester, doing taxes, filling out FAFSA, paying off a debt, etc -- the type of shit I usually let hang over my head for months.

8) I have been reading a book. A fucking book! It's been years since I have done this for fun and I am way into it. I tried many times to read high and never lasted more than a few pages. I was always rereading stuff/losing track of what was happening.

9) My ups and downs in the day are smoother. I have still been taking mid day naps but that is from external factors not worth explaining here.

10) I get joy and interest in things because they are actually fun and/or interesting. It's not because I'm the perfect level of high. Part of this is the fact that it's easier to get into new movies or shows. I don't know why but, being high all the time, I was more reluctant to try new media. I have watched a ton of different movies and shows in the past month and I actually remember what happened in said shows/movies. I find this genuinely enriching.

Before I say anything else, I am on day two of sober-ness and have been doing OK so far and my stash is literally at an arms reach..  along with MJ, I also dropped alcohol & tobacco, all cold turkey so when it comes to physically restricting myself, no worries there as I feel I have a fair amount of discipline in that area specifically..  

To be honest, what terrifies me the most is facing life and more so, myself and my mental capacity sober.. 
I didn’t start to indulge in anything until after high school and looking back, I feel like the trend from recreational to medicinal quickly turned to habitual use and ultimately a complete distraction and avoidance of a number of personal issues and goals I once had.
My goals and dreams, long forgotten or unfeasible now.. my personal issues, still there and stronger then ever! 

I mention these things because I have read a few times in here, being sober isn’t the goal and I like that way of thinking because all I want is the ability to be self sufficient, independent and if I can find some form of relief or comfort in my own skin, well that would be fabulous!  

Sorry, I know I do need professional help with this, which I will seek in a week or two, but I’m choosing to wait because I want to go into it as sober as is possible for myself... 

I guess I’m just venting as these last two days have been extremely LONG...  I can’t believe how much time has slowed in these last two days!

When I smoked sporadically, getting a bit high and having sex was amazing, no doubt. But when high became my normal, it was nothing out of the ordinary anymore. Except I still payed for it by having a schizo dick that could go limp at the drop of a hat, or I would have trouble climaxing. I tried to make the most of it by going down on the girl if it happened, to try and keep the temperature at least luke warm until I got hard again, but I would end up giving up more often than not. Then 10 minutes would pass and I'd get horny again, but same problem as soon as we started.

Then it was always at the back of my mind and I'd find excuses not to have sex, unless I hadnt climaxed in a few days or something so I knew I could keep it up. This messed with me a loooot, I really hope nobody in here can relate cause sex is so important and healthy, for your own mental health and also as a bonding tool with your partner. Getting thought loops about maybe youre not attracted to her anymore (and she would obv think the same, although she wont say and shell be supportive), maybe youre too old and sex is over for you etc etc.... It FUCKS. YOU. UP! Your self worth, your masculinity, your everything. I tried vitamins and nofap/no porn, it helped somewhat but what a boring life and huge sacrifice when you cant even enjoy a wank before sleep cause you have a date tomorrow. What a sad day when youre not able to enjoy fucking. And what a pathetic life when you *choose* that over a getting high.

Now, friends... A month without, Im a different person. I have a different dick. I get rock hard from a gust in the wind, I stay hard as long as I want, and damn I didnt know how much I missed not being able to hold back my climax - which is more intense and longer lasting than ever. The refractory period has gone from a several hours (on a good day) to half an hour. And before, even if I got hard, I couldnt come more than once on an evening. Now I even managed to come from a BJ for the first time since I was a teenager. Needless to say the GF is thrilled, haha.

If I had known, if I could compare and feel this, it would be all the motivation I needed to quit. Sober sex is, pardon the fun, *fucking amazing*.

I want to work with the stress and negative emotions I’m experiencing without weed. Instead I’m using breathwork, Qi Gong, meditation, movement, journaling, and connecting more deeply with myself and others. I want to continue these practices and more, not fall backwards.

I smoked and drank daily (and drugged when I could) for over 20 years.   Getting intoxicated was my release, my escape, my way to amplify fun, my way to soothe pain, my way to stay sane, my way to sleep. 


In short, getting high was my response for everything in life.  


-


I’ve been sober for over 4 years now.  No booze for 7 years.  And the most remarkable thing has happened.  I have learned how to feel comfortable in my own sober skin.  The result of this has been the total loss of any desire to smoke.  


-


I’ve realized that getting intoxicated and high only felt good because feeling bad was my norm.   
Teenage anxiety, low level depression, poor self esteem.  These were all temporarily cured with a good smoking or drinking session.   Intoxication became my instant fix for every unpleasant feeling.  


-


The devastating consequence of this early adoption of drug and alcohol abuse was I never learned how to manage my emotions in a healthy way. 
And I completely lost the ability to enjoy life sober.   How fucked up is that...?!


-


These days, the thought of getting drunk or high is abhorrent.  There’s too much to do, see and feel for me to spend hours hiding up in my head.  


I’ve recovered from addiction and it’s the best high I’ve ever felt.   Thanks for reading.",7

I know I dont have much of a physical addiction because whenever I stop I dont experience most symptoms related to severing yourself. Ive been avoiding smoking for 8 days now and the only thing ive felt is slight mood swings.

Didnt fall asleep until 06:00, and woke up at 07:30, despite going to bed well before 22:00. Not such a big deal. I actually fell asleep after commenting a bit here, something i was feeling a bit guilty for not doing enough of the last two days.

I remember when sober, not detoxing - actually sober for extended periods of time - when i was a kid, I had super intense, often lucid, dreams. Kept a journal of them. It's where my ideas to write things, build things, code things, came from. 

They were often violent, graphic, sexual, and contained a complete story start to finish. I was also never in them. even though they were often in first person, it was first person of someone else, and who that else was changed throughout. Like a movie, or in the case of lucid ones video game. I also don't dream about people i know, but nevertheless have intense emotional bonds with characters in them, and quite often die repeatedly in them. They were... great. A huge source of inspiration of art, stories, and music. It was part of my identity. Many people tell me they couldnt cope if they had dreams like that every night... I strived in it, looked forward to the next adventure, romance, thriller, horror.

I finally had my first dream last night, and it was utterly amazing. It was worth fighting through the insomnia. Unfortunately, right before waking up, my ""partner"" and i were riding a glass elevator, she was hit by a cannonball, and her head was replaced with a squirting stump of flesh, sinew, bone, and teeth, with a 24-pounder sitting on top.  My poor white suit was ruined, and she comically remained standing, felt her ""head,""  then walked out the broken window. Upon awakening, I immediately started to throw up. 

Honestly though... it was great. I hope more than anything now, that I might be able to continue sobriety, JUST so I may possibly go back to my old routine of dream journalling, and developing those logs into full fledged stories.

I decided I am going to go see my old friend. Today. Will ask him to not smoke around me, and I'm pretty sure he wont. It will be nice to spend some time with an old friend... Even if we are in masks and 2 metres apart.",2

(Changed for weed),"It's been almost 24 hours off pure will and desire to quit. Now I need to rewire my unconscious brain to love myself and help myself. You can say these mantras in your head or out loud, do it a few times every day whenever and wherever. Repeat these words to yourself throughout the day and make them your rock. My girlfriends father told me that a very high up hypnosis psychologist taught him how to change his subconscious so that he would have no desires and could prepare him to do anything with mental preparation. He quit cold turkey after 18 years of cigs, if he can do that, we can do this. We're all in this together! 


1.	Create a quiet space (to focus)
2.	Breath in through left nostril and out right nostril 3 times to slow down breath. (Slows breath)
3.	Tell myself “Using weed is poison” *Repeat
4.	Tell myself “I need my mind and body to live healthily and happily” *Repeat 
5.	Tell myself “I owe my mind and body this respect and protection” *Repeat


This will create a lasting subconscious impact that will allow us to love ourself instead of hate ourself, to help heal instead of cure, to understand that this is for our best interest and to make us happy. 

I love you all. Good luck and I hope this helps in any way.

I scored on Day 7 and didn't even smoke it. Having some material close from me isn't helping AT ALL. I wanted to build self-discipline, but it's just making not smoking harder for myself. 

I know I might relapse sooner than later, for now I can cope with it thinking ""that's ok, i can smoke if i want to, but it's gotta be tomorrow."". That positive procrastination works for now, but for how long?

I got some energy back from not smoking, but the hardest is occupying my mind and body, creating and doing stuff. I feel like i HAVE to relapse (yet again) to regret getting high again and wishing i could stop.

I'm making up excuses to smoke again, like ""relapse only gets you closer to being free"", ""only on the weekends is already a huge achievement"" and stuff. Focusing my mind too much on it instead of other things, but I can't seem to do otherwise.

The more i'm told that it is bad for me and that I shouldn't smoke EVER AGAIN, the more i want to relapse.

I know i have the keys to stop, and i already don't wanna be high 24/7 like before, but man it's hard to kick old habits.

I haven't been able to sleep since. Resisting smoking hasn't been too challenging for me, but this side-effect is kicking my butt. I had sleep problems prior to quitting- they were a major reason it became a daily habit. I've never gone this long without falling asleep in exhaustion before, though. 

I would not have imagined it would be so painful. My brain is a beehive, and my body feels like I am intermittently being punched and floating above it, not feeling anything. I've started fantasizing about various accidents I could have involving getting knocked out so that I could experience something akin to sleep (not in a self-harm sort of way). Laying down silently is painful because there's nothing to distract me from the discomfort, but engaging in any sort of active or passive task is overwhelming or disorienting. It hurts just existing. I look like an absolute ghost. My cheeks look hollow like I've been starved, but I'm eating more than ever. I dread that I won't be able to get some sleep before a virtual meeting I have to appear in on Monday. 

I'm frustrated that the methods I have in my repertoire aren't effective. Usually a good jerkoff and yoga session followed by an audiobook will knock me out. I've been scouring this subreddit and other online resources for more ideas, but no dice. Nothing I haven't heard of before and tried. Yesterday I even resorted to jogging until I couldn't breath, even though I regard cardio as a cruel punishment under most circumstances. Today I broke down and took a zquil, but all it did was mix up my thoughts a bit more and make my ears ring. I can't help but get jealous as I'm reading posts on here about others having vivid dreams. I would give anything to experience even a terrifying, violent dream right now, if it meant sleeping breifly.

I got into weed about 5 years ago when I started hanging out with a new group of friends at the job we all worked at. I was addicted from the first few puffs. I loved the way it made me feel. Especially once I started smoking alone. I’m a very introverted person by nature and smoking alone made me feel like I was on a donut floaty just floating down a river of cool thoughts and insights it was sick. Ever since, I’ve been trying to chase those feelings of a free mind, not knowing that I was digging myself deeper and deeper in to a hole. Fast forward to late 2019, a friend of mine commits suicide(we used to work to together, not part of the same friend group but we did hang out). I started smoking more and more to cope(2-4 joints a day, and started smoking as soon as I woke up). I went into a depression that I’ve been trying to get out of since November 2019. 

I started seeing a therapist, it has helped a lot, but I have a long way to go. I recommend to anyone feeling like they are anxious or depressed to the point of not being able to keep up with day to day tasks like I was.

This group has helped me make one of the biggest steps towards recovery yet. I can’t thank you all enough.

I had been smoking ever since I was 14, but I quit about 4 years ago, when I was just 23. And I was able to do so thanks to one person. So let me tell you this story. You might have a good laugh or it will make you cringe and u will quit smoking as well. Ok, here it goes.

I used to be friends with this one guy. Let's call him  Mr. Creeps. He had a legitimate obsession with me. He even had a notebook with facts about me, he was always trying to copy everything I do and say. After a while he stopped having his own opinion and he replaced his thinking process with me. Of course after a while I couldn't stand being around mr Creeps for much longer because I had a feeling I will be woken up in the middle of the night cause he would be staring at me. In fact, he once touched my cheek and said: ""your skin is so soft. I wish I could wear it"". So yeah, you are probably creeped out by him at this point. The only reason I kept talking to him is cause we worked together. I would take my smoke breaks during my lunch. So one day I was standing outside of the office, smoking. This is when mr Creeps came to me, hugged me and said: ""mmmmm my mother used to smoke these cigarettes. You smell just like Her"".

I’m proud of myself for handling so much anxiety- 3 jobs (including one I just started before the pandemic so I’ve been learning it at home alone), moving, and feeling all sorts of feels about the pandemic. If I can be free from weed in this moment during all of this, I can stick to it come what may.


I’m so so grateful for this page. Your support and camaraderie have lifted me spirits. If you’re thinking about it- give it a shot. This clarity feels so good.",5

So far it's been 2 months and 21 days that I quit. I used quite heavily (2 - 5 joints a day) and I told myself that I would quit after my mom and sister returned from holiday. I looked forward to that weekend where my mom and sister went away for a few months, but once that weekend arrived and I had everything set up (fridge full of nice drinks, food everywhere, movielist ready to go) it just didn't live up to the hype i created for myself. I planned my quit-moment a month in advance and went out with a bang, lol. I didn't really think I would manage it but I just stayed in once my mom returned home. And after that night I stayed in again, and before I knew those first (absolutely horrible) 2 weeks were over and it became easier to not smoke. 

Over the last 5 years since I used, I already quit twice for 2 months and 1 time for one month but every time it slipped back in. The main thing probably for me to smoke was because I don't really have any hobbies (except gaming and watching Netflix, but I don't count those as real hobbies). Since I stopped smoking I can't fit in a healthy diet in my schedule, I just don't really care about that I guess, which I should maybe but I don't know how. 

Anyway, back to smoking, I'm debating whether or not I should allow myself to hit 2 or 3 spliffs tomorrow night to lay of some steam. The past times things went south once I crossed that line, but I tell myself that I can control it to just do it once, and just tomorrow night. 

Did anyone here just smoked one time again? And how did you manage to stay on the right path after that? Or did you find a way to avoid it all together and just decided not to smoke.


UPDATE: I slept over it last night, and when I woke up my cravings were gone. I talked to some people from this topic, thanks for the help. You fucking rock /r/leaves",2

2020-05-01 17:13:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gbqjyr/i_threw_it_all_away/,I threw it all away,"I had been a chronic user for about 10 years. I managed to kick the habit back in January of 2019 and I was clean up until late March of this year. 

I hadn't had the easiest couple of years employment wise. I was let go of one job in 2017 because the company was shutting down operations, and then my next one I quit in december of 2018 due to irreconcilable differences between me and my boss. That's when I first quit. But the issue that plagued me was temptation, as I'm sure alot of you are familiar with. 

Nevertheless I was able to stave off the temptation, and I landed my dream job in February of 2019. There was even a preliminary drug screening which I passed. I did it. I was free. I had mastered my dependency on weed. Or so I thought. Then came CoVid 19. 

Layoffs started. People all around me were losing their jobs. My girlfriend works for Kroger and I was constantly ridden with anxiety. ""Will she get the virus? Will she recover if she does? Will I get laid off? What happens if I do? No one is hiring and I cant imagine what I will do if this happens?"" 

All of these questions were buzzing around me like a swarm of bees, and as a result my anxiety had surged to a point where I felt I almost had no control; that I was living in constant worry of so many things that were ultimately out of my control, and yet could so adversely affect me and my stability. 

My judgement lapsed. My mental state plummeted. So I made the call, and picked up a vape cartridge.

That first hit in more than a year was so relieving. I faded into a sense of euphoria. All the anxiety. All the pain. All the worry simply faded. In that moment, I felt in control of my own emotions for once. But as the month wore on, each session became more infested with self guilt. Not because I was worried about things like my job or getting sick, but because I was starting to once again realize what I was putting at stake. 

My job. My relationships. The trust my girlfriend had in me. 

So today, I had a moment of realization. I decided I'm not going to lie to myself any longer. This stuff is only a temporary refuge. A vice. A crutch that I dont need. 

Too much is at risk. Yes I was worried about so much, but that was because it all matters so, so much to me. I love my girlfriend with all of my heart and that was the worst part of it; hiding it from her. 

This temporary state of being was not worth it, and relief had turned to guilt. So, I took charge of myself. I took charge of my emotions. There is too much at stake here that I care about that I won't lose over my own poor judgement. 

So I threw everything away. My vape pen. My weed. My grinder. 

Everything. Gone. 

Now, hopefully I can start the clock fresh. And this page is in part to thank for that moment of self realization. 

Weed, you were something I did in college. You were a vice I used to get through alot of tough times, including an abusive 3 year relationship. 

But now, I know I'm strong enough. Thank you, but its time for me to move on.",14

I just had diarrhea and shit myself, this never happened before when I smoked pot.

The nausea is intense when I try and eat, my appetite is gone after 3-4 bites and anything I try to swallow gets me super nauseous. I just threw up my breakfast this morning. I notice I am super bored, I do miss that feeling of being buzzed and letting my brain get used to the boredom...

I haven’t been able to sleep as well, maybe 2 hours I haven’t had any vivid dreams yet as this is the first day. 
Can anyone please tell me how to find ways to cope without the weed? I know the first few days are going to be hell on earth as my adjusts to its sober state but man...

Symptoms :
Cold Sweats
Hot Flashes
Extreme Shaking
Pounding Chest
Nausea
Fever
Vomiting
Muscle/Body Pain
Fatigue
Difficulty Breathing
Chest Pain/Pressure 
Bloating
Headaches
No appetite

On day 8 my difficulty breathing was so bad  that I went to urgent care. I was diagnosed with pneumonia and tested for COVID-19 (Negative).
Now that I have been taking the medications for a couple days I feel as though I’m finally turning the corner. This past week there had been times in the middle of the night where I was seriously worried with how sick I was. Even with 24/7 bed rest and Tylenol every 4 hours, I was getting worse and worse. Now that I’m starting to feel better I’m seriously relieved.

For those of you out there that are having several symptoms wether from heavy use or not, please get help if you really don’t feel good. I had been searching this reddit religiously to try to back up how poorly I was doing physically. I want to say please don’t do this and see a health professional if you guys are really feeling terrible.

I started when we met about five years ago. Remember when it was fun? Remember when it made stuff funny, food amazing, sex amazing and all your worries go away? It only became every day once we moved in together, but I knew it was problem about two years ago. Stopped being fun. I knew i needed to stop for All the same reasons as everyone else, feeling unmotivated, guilty, anxious, grumpy, but still wanting to get high by midday every day. And then it wasn't high anymore, it was just a part of my day that I needed to not feel grumpy and on edge. But id just convinced myself of this, because five minutes in I just felt sleepy and on edge instead. I hated how fast my thoughts would go, how I couldn't stop myself from thinking about everything I worried about. 

And now. I feel better, I'm proud of myself for stopping. I don't feel grumpy. I just feel low. Like everything I do is just to get through another day. My fiance still smokes. Not as much, maybe three times a day. I miss him. I miss sharing one with him instead of waiting in bed for him to have his. I miss laughing at YouTube and having crazy sex. Now we just sit quietly. And every time we do something slightly sexy all I can think is he's high. I can't let go and enjoy the moment. The urges to have some are getting stronger but not to get high, because I know I won't. My body doesn't like that chemical anymore and I won't get high, I'm get anxious and hate myself for it. Just to do it together is what I miss :(",3

I stopped counting a while ago because, hey, what’s the point if I just don’t smoke again?

I haven’t really been craving weed over the past couple of weeks. I’ve found solace in exercising, meditating, playing music, just doing whatever to make my time well-spent so that I don’t miss it. But I went out to see a friend yesterday (EDIT: feel the need to clarify; social distanced walk. Take the pandemic seriously!) and she was talking about how active she was and that she was doing edibles these days instead of smoking because of the pandemic. She looked really good and happy, and I was wondering if I could reach that same balance, because I had chalked up a lot of my happiness to my exercising. I just wanted to get high one more time; the edible in particular sounded really nice.

After ruminating over it, I knew it wouldn’t be just once (I know that all too well for the million times I’ve fallen into that trap). But the craving took a while to go away. I realized that, right then anyway, I hadn’t been all that happy and it felt like it had been that way for a while.

But I think that was just the headspace I was in...I can’t always be high on life, you need valleys to have the peaks. But it was hard man, I craved that *high* you know?

What snapped me out of it, it’s sad to say, was a Snapchat from a friend. He took a hit from his Pax and blew the smoke into the camera (that whole thing), and had the familiar droned over look on his face and dead eyes. I don’t mean to insult him or anyone who smokes, but it was a reminder of who I’ll turn into the second I take that hit. It’s a red herring to think it would be fun. It won’t. I’ll regret it and fall back into the hole, like all the last times.

Today is a much better day. I’m excited to hike up a mountain later. I just wanted to reflect on this and remind you that urges can come out of absolute nowhere, but then they do go away. Abstinence is worth it. Keep pushing past the urge and you’ll see it that way on the other side.",13

Still, the phrase ""I want to die"" was on repeat in my mind, I could think of it, mumble it or (when alone) say it out loud multiple times a day, every day for the last two bloody years at least.

But the longer into my newfound sobriety, the less I feel like I deserve to die. This feeling of inadequacy, of having no self-worth gradually fades away. I can feel my mental health quickly improving, and I just noticed I haven't said or thought that I want to die for a couple of days.

This is something new for me - not repeating that phrase. This feeling of freedom from this goddamn mantra is a new high on its own. I'm so happy.

After I quit weed I faced my demons which I simply put away thanks to being high all the time and they hit me hard, so hard that I had to went into therapy for 12 weeks again just to get my brain once again together.

I have depression and a personality disorder, so weed was the perfect opportunity for me to shut down everything and pretend it isn't there. I hurt my parents, especially my mother and nearly everyone in my social circles I interacted with thanks to being a regular day by day user for the longest time. It put me in a lot of misery, lifewise and moneywise, and I am slowly but surely crawling back to the surface to once again try living my life.

Please remember that the entire thing of getting clean is a process with highs and lows. If you relapse or face other hard issues on your way, please don't get discouraged on your way.

To preface, I have been  a multi-daily smoker with cartridges or bud since I was 18 to now 23.  Usually starts in the morning, and I'll smoke once or twice throughout work (I work in home repair and remodeling, my boss doesn't know but praises the work I do both high and sober both in office work and in the field) and I'll smoke throughout the night. All responsibilities are taken care of but my workout routine has become scarce, I notice more freetime in front of screens, and I'm not near as social as before I started smoking. 

I am aware of the fact that I have an addiction and I want to quit. However, whenever I weigh the pros and cons, I always justify the fact that I am doing fine, I am in the process of buying my first house, spend time with family,  am in pretty good shape, and have had no trouble with the law.

Everytime I go dry for a day I use these excuses. I recognize that I only feel better if I smoke. 

How do I break the perception that my addiction isn't harming me, Or at least the thought process that leads me there?",5

Being in quarantine, going through a breakup, and isolated from my friends and family (I haven't touched another person in 40 days) I relapsed a couple of weeks ago. I'm only on day 3 of this most recent iteration of sobriety, but the last 2 years have been a huge step for me in constant recovery after 3 years of smoking daily - I know the drill. Call my dad, he forgives me and he gets it (has been almost 30 years straight after a couple of decades buried in pot) go for long bike rides, eat a ton of chocolate, read mystery novels and call my friends. Even if you have to reset the counter all that work doesn't go to waste. Every time you fall it gets easier to get back up and withdrawal is easier. I feel so proud and grateful for the men who came before me and my capacity to bounce back. I'm back in school, best shape of my life, landed a sweet job despite pandemic, and surrounded by people who love me even if they're not physically with me. 

Life is good.

I smoked for more 10 years, abused for 5. It affected in all aspects of my life. Just like some of you here, I don’t even enjoy the high anymore but just felt like I needed a joint. I would lie to everybody just to hide my high and I felt like a real addict.
Insomnia, rage and anxiety are the worst withdrawals for me, especially insomnia, which lasted more then 2 weeks before. 

I will push thru the withdrawals and this will be my last day 1!

(the more consistent my diet is the more solid my stools are) Sorry if thats TMI. Just thought id share incase anyone else has had these withdrawal symptom's.

I’m a 21 (soon to be 22) year old grad student, and has gone around 44 days clean, cold turkey. 

I’ve started smoking since I was around 17, had the occasional joint and then slowly started to become a daily smoker until I was around 19 (3+ bong hits daily). I stopped, thanks to my girlfriend, but I would always pick it up during winter and summer breaks (so three months off, a month or two on, daily). This lasted until I was 21, then I picked up thc pills and went crazy on them (from 25mg to 150mg daily). This lasted for 6 months. 

Ive been reading studies on weed and permanent damage during adolescent use. I currently have bad short term memory, kinda slowly processing speed but don’t know if I’m actually imagining and stressing myself. Funny how I started noticing these things after I started reading into studies.

Does anyone have the same experience? Have I permanently fried my brain? I know I shouldn’t dwell on that, and I still think I’m relatively bright right now but will I ever be as smart as I used to be?

Feeling great for it, cravings seem to be gone and I am getting into a more regular sleep pattern again (also no sweats so far).

Been able to make a lot of positive strides in this 2 weeks alone such as exercising more regularly, doing things I had been putting off, reading again and even having therapy for the first time (these are things I would never do when I was high).

Still having the crazy dreams and also feeling pretty low sometimes but I guess this is part of the process...

Wish I had done this years ago and feel like a real idiot for not giving it a chance before even though people who I love and respect told me to - I guess I was just too stubborn.

But for anyone who is thinking about quitting and like me has smoked daily for years and years, I really recommend you try it and don't waste any more time like I did!",6

I’m the kind smoker who’s into the carts and flower and all but carts have usually been my to go since theyre so discreet. I ran out and I only had the flower, I usually have to sneak out of my window without alarming anyone out of my room going through the door. But i am the laziest person ever that I won’t even do that, I was too lazy to go smoke, and the messed up part was that I caught myself trying to convince myself to go out and smoke a quick bowl. I still had my mind on it anyways and said as soon as i smoke I’ll feel better and not worry about it so much. When I came out to use the restroom really quick before I went out I looked at my cat who I really love he’s a little guy and a month old or so, he heard me coming out and when I looked at him I just broke. I started crying. I felt bad because he wanted to see me, he wanted to hang out and play a little bit. Why would I want to deny that for a smoke. Never in my life will I choose smoking over the things I really care about. I hope that I can permanently stop smoking. I’ve been with this little guy hanging out since 2 am. I just keep crying and crying not believing that I finally woke up again. I’m so proud of myself for getting out of the hole once again.",17

It was so fun at first and I have such fond memories of the first year where everything was exciting and I was relaxed. I thought it was the perfect way to relax after a hard day work and justified it like having a pint in the evening. 

But I’ve been wanting to quit for over a year now and I hate how dependant I am on a joint every evening to relax and enjoy my night. The last few nights I’ve been on the fence about smoking but did so anyway and immediately regretted it!

I hate being smoky and my mouth tasting bad. I hate being slow and unable to talk to people because I don’t want them to know I’m high. I hate that I do exactly the same stuff I would do sober but just because it’s past 8pm I have to be high. I hate how it makes my heart race and every slight pain makes me think I’m gonna die. I hate getting too high and feeling dizzy. I hate how groggy I feel the day after. But I can’t seem to stop. 

Every morning I wake up hating myself for smoking and vowing not to in the evening. And as the day goes by my resolve weakens util it’s 9:30pm and I’m saying to myself I might as well I have nothing else to do. And I get anxious before I smoke and convince myself I’ll only be able to relax if I follow through. 

I want to quit. Today is gonna be my first proper attempt and I’m hoping posting this will make me accountable. 

Any advice and help is really appreciated!!! I don’t want to lose my twenties to this drug.

EDIT: wow thanks so much for all your support, I really didn’t expect this much response and I really appreciate it! It’s so nice to know there’s so many other people in the same situation because if other people can do it then so can I!! Love to you all and good luck on your individual journeys",41

2020-05-01 04:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gbekwc/not_smoking_on_weed_since_last_3_years/,Not smoking on weed since last 3 years.,"Edit: Not getting high on weed since 3 years*.
Hello everyone. Just found this sub. Read some good success stories and got to know about other's problems as well.
Ok lets get started, I took my first joint after my finals of high school. I'm from Nepal so weed is cheap and easily available. When I entered medschool my consumption just skyrocketed. Had some panic attacks early on but I didn't give it much thought. After 3 years of being high every second of the day I decided to cut down. But I failed, after the earthquake, I started again as I used to. 
   What I believe is weed has different effect on different people. (My very close friends with whom Im still close with) They are very confident and comfortable when they are high. Good for them. Before weed, I was very charismatic, positive and joyful person. After 5 years of smoking I became very negative, cynical  and kind of a loner. 
 Then during my internship I changed something. I stopped smoking in groups but still staying and laughing with them. I cant explain it how that started though. I still smoked but when I wanted to. Mostly during night. Smoking just cause others are, stopped making sense. I would have some stash back in my room, so I was okay with not smoking with my friends, cause my subconscious was at peace with the idea of me getting high at night. 
   After this I had drastically cut down on weed. I came to the realization that I am more high when I dont smoke. Weed didn't make me high , it made me low. I started to feel good without weed. The effect had reversed. Then I just stopped smoking alone as well. It took a lot of willpower initially. But when I stopped relapsing it got easier.  
 So after 3 years What I honestly want to share is I smoke weed once in a while. When I go for trekking or if there is a get together of friends or if I am very drunk at a party. Never smoke it alone. 
 Most Importantly DON'T TREAT WEED LIKE A DEVIL WHO IS THERE TO DESTROY YOU. DON'T BE SCARED OF WEED. 
 Don't let weed smoke the life out of you. And never rush to quit. It is a slow process. YOU'LL FAIL COUNTLESS TIME. But you're doomed if you stop trying to quit. Weed has its benefits and it is fun as well but in moderation. Control your emotions that is all you need to do. 
All the Best my friend.",5

2020-05-01 00:45:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gbbrzf/4th_day_in_quiting_nicotine_and_weed/,4th day in quiting Nicotine and Weed,"Hey guys recently I just quit smoking weed and vaping nicotine. It all started 4 days ago when I took a hit of my dab pen and gotten overwhelmed with a hit of nausea. I immediately ran to the bathroom and was puking for like 3 hours till only foam was coming out. I've been smoking really consistent since I've been 15 and picked up nicotine a year later, im 18 now. 

Now being nauseous is quite normal for me after starting to smoke weed, I would always be nauseous in the morning and would need a quick toke to straighten the knots in my stomach. The nausea started right around a year of smoking weed constantly so I've always had it in my head that maybe weed was the cause of my shitty appetite and always being nauseous In the morning, but my love for weed was too much and thought to my self that I could always fix it by smoking more weed so what was the problem.

 Anyways after my three hour puking session, with my head in the toilet I ask my self if this is the life I really want. Do I always want to be nauseous in the morning and puke randomly. I get out of the bathroom grab my pen, rig, disposable nicotine devices, and the last of my wax and throw it all in the trash. After this I went to bed but I was shaking and having cold sweats, as well as anxiety and possibly a near panic attack. I eventually fall asleep and woke up nauseous as fuck, throwing up a bunch of stomach fluids and such. I got up from the toilet and I noticed how weak I was getting from the dehydration and lack of solid food for me the anxiety was getting stronger and stronger.

 However, three hours later my grandma wakes up and starts puking her brains out as well and I realized that im puking more than usual because I caught a stomach bug or got food poisoning. Unfortunately, I kept puking and got scared for my health cause I couldn't keep anything down and went to the hospital. Yikes the hospitals now during this pandemic are 100x more freaky with everybody wearing full body suits with some type of very loud air filter they were wearing. Anyways I was there for like 6 hours just getting fluid through an IV and getting prescribed Some pills for nausea and getting more pills for anti acids which I went to the doctors earlier for because I thought I had a legit stomach problem. But after having a camera showed down into my stomach like a year or so ago and doctors saying im perfectly healthy I knew the stomach problems we're something to do with weed.

 Fast forward to today, was the first time I felt the need to eat anything which I just ate a cup of ramen and that's it. These 4 days have been pretty brutal and im pretty scared, my stomach is constantly in pain, my anxiety is through the roof, and I barely have enough strength to stay on my feet for 5 minutes. Thank God for lockdown right now otherwise I would be fucked for calling off work and school. I really hope my appetite will come back just like before I started smoking. (For people wondering I vaped salt nicotine, high percentage which I think might be a reason for me having such bad anxiety off it and shaking). I hope someone will read this and is in a similar boat and doesn't feel alone. Because I feel alone and it sucks.",2
