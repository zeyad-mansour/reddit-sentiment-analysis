I smoked weed for about 6 years, all day everyday. Im actually at day 11 sober. Its been pretty hard and i was wondering if it was normal to have anxiety attacks ? Like is it possible that my mind is sooo focus about a thing that it makes it true ? I can feel my heart bumping into my chest and it makes me more anxious so my heart bumping even faster, its like an infinite cycle. I cant unfeel it, unless im super focus on something like videogames etc. I was a elite soccer player as a child and teenager so i guess my heart is not that bad lol. Sometimes I think im becoming crazy... Can someone relate or its just me ? Pk

I used to self-medicate with weed, bc I didn't always take great care of myself--I didn't let myself do things like rest and eat, and weed encouraged me to do both those things.

It's not only about self-care, it's about being in the healthiest state of mind so I can be the best mom for my son.

A month ago my grandmother died and i saw this as a sign to change my life. I stopped cold turkey just like how i stopped smoking cigarettes 2 years ago.

The thing i hated the most about smoking weed is that the cravings before the joint were bigger then the reward feeling i had after. I always felt like something could go wrong at any time and i got realy scared and had to calm myself down. 

I dont know what my message is to you. But i start to feel better and i want you all to have this feeling too.

Instead of smoking a joint, i am reading a book right now. A month ago i could not bring up the concentration to do it. But now i do so,

I unsubscribed from this sub after about 2 months just so I could have minimal reminders that weed was even a thing, however I'll always be so thankful for all the stories I read here, and how it helped me feel like I wasn't alone on this journey. 5 months give or take a few days is where I'm at now, and it's the longest I've gone in over 6 years. The first time i smoked weed was out of a gravity bong made from a 2 liter Fanta bottle at the skatepark when I was 16. I fell in love the first time I smoked. Everything seemed better, literally everything. The day after that I smoked weed and the day after that, and the day after....I went around 6-7 years without a single day sober. I mean smoking from morning until night, all day high. Going to work high, class high, every activity high, wasting countless hours watching stupid Youtube videos, smoking myself to the point of isolation and even when i stopped enjoying weed because of the awkward feeling social affect it seemed to give me after about 5 years i kept going. smoking alone everyday. I could write a novel about my experience I think but I want to keep this short in case it can help anyone. Here are some lessons/problems and things to look out for that I've encountered so far. I hope I can help someone like so many helped me on this sub:

1. Be careful that after quitting smoking your brain will search for other ways to avoid being sober, alcohol was the biggest for me and I have gotten it under control but beware of this, your brain will realize weed isn't an option and for some of us will move to the next best things.
2. After a few months, you'll laugh at the fact weed would control your life in the way it did. For my fellow ex 24/7 smokers, only sober when you're asleep, weed seems impossible to live without, however it really is possible, many people in fact the majority of the world goes the day without smoking weed, you can too.
3. It only benefits people in very rare cases, yes weed has proven to help seizures and vets with PTSD fall asleep, but for the majority of us it is not needed, so many of my stoner friends would fool themselves and convince themselves they needed to smoke, that somehow it was helping them...just plain wrong. Weed slows you down, it saps your physical energy, your mind may explode with creativity in the first 20 min after smoking, however all your left with is remnants of those ideas and a body to tired to act on any of them.
4. When weed exits, reality steps in, and this can be that hardest part. Emotion will crawl back in. From everything like getting road rage to crying over an ex or something, feelings you have pushed away for years will come right back. Humans are meant to feel, you're not supposed to be in some steady state all the time. It's okay to reminisce about good times with Mary Jane, i got so many fond memories. But it was time to move on, mary jane when I abused her made me a shell of myself.
5. A sense of determination was the biggest thing that came back to me. Quitting is not a cure all, it is far from it, in fact some things get way worse, but that's because they're supposed to be that way. Quitting simply allows you to start facing these problems. when bored your brain looks for something to do to better your situation, a signal that you're wasting time, weed strips this away because it makes simple entertainment (youtube, tv, video games) so much more intoxicating.
6. So many worries go away. No more worrying about running out, no more grimacing as you drop more cash on an eighth that'll be gone in two days, no more worrying about the smell, the tired look, falling asleep in the middle of the day, no more avoiding family and situations where its not appropriate to be high.

I don't want the post to be too long I rambled on here, I have so many more things I've learned I could share, but we're all in this together and experiences are sometimes eerily similar among us. it's been a  journey of ups and downs from smoking 20+ bong rips of weed and tobacco plus a few blunts everyday to no weed at all for around 5 months. I've got so much more to go and so much more to fix about myself but I hope this post can maybe help some people. Everyone who is trying to quit you're making a great decision, and you CAN do it! The only way out of something is through it, and you can get through this. thanks to anyone who reads all of this, keep posting and best of luck",527,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9930351972579956}"

It feels good. I'm on day 2 now.

My goal is to double my 10 day streak to 20 days, and maybe make it to 30 days or above. By that point I hope my perspective and/or the hold weed still has on me will have lifted to the point where I feel like I don't need it to function anymore. I've been smoking daily for almost a decade now, but I've wanted to quit for about the last 5 years. Now that I'm 30 there's just a voice saying: ""If you don't get this under control now, it will control you for the rest of your life."" I'm finally starting to really listen to it.

While I'd always argue that weed helped me sleep that wasn't entirely true. I always smoked right before bed, it was always the biggest dose of the day and always a powerful indica because in my mind that was what I needed to sleep. Often I would lay in bed for one, two or more hours either with racing thoughts or watching something on my phone. Eventually I'd fall asleep, wake up groggy then slam as much caffiene into me as I needed to get me through the day. I repeated this every day / night. Sometimes I felt okay but a lot of times I didn't.

Now I'm 5 months clean. At first my sleep was horrible, then it got better but still not the best. For the last 3 weeks I had been running on 3, 4 or 5 (if I was lucky) hours of sleep a night - everynight. My anxiety was high, I was becoming depressed and unmotivated. It got to the point where last night I took something (OTC) to help me sleep because I was desparate. I got 8+ hours. It was incredible in the difference I felt today. Anxiety was way lower, my work productivity shot up and I felt good about myself and life again. I'm going to do the same thing tonight, and the next night. I know this can be a dangerous road by so is sleep depravation. Hopefully in time I'll be able to resume normal, natural sleep again.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8033244609832764}"

I wanted to be (and some days was) in a constant high. Every dollar from my paycheck went either towards weed or vape and it got to the point where I would rather blow all my money on those two rather than actually feeding myself. 

Prior to starting weed 2 years ago, I made a goal to gain weight because I am a very skinny guy and it made me hate myself and it made me insecure. I’ve hated myself since middle school. Whenever I smoked, my problems temporarily disappeared, and I fell in love with weed. 

For the next 2 years, I’d spend hundreds of dollars a month buying new bongs, ounces of weed, new vape mods. I even bought enough nicotine juice to last me over a year. All of my money for recreation, while I was living off of munchies and various other snacks. I’ve lost 10lbs of my weight gain progress that I worked my ass off for. 

Everything began spiraling out of control for me. I started to care less about school, which cause me to fail many classes and tank my gpa. I got into several arguments with my parents. Hell I even almost got kicked out on several occasions (I am super thankful for my parents being patient with me and I regret any argument I started with them). It was around this time when I started taking magic mushrooms and lsd.

Eventually the quarantine came around and my dealers stopped selling temporarily and my local vape shop closed. I started some self reflection and I noticed the shitty life I was living. I said fuck it all and went cold turkey. The first months were grueling but I managed to land myself a job which motivated me to keep going. I rediscovered a lost hobby of mine, learning languages. Japanese became really interesting to me and I started my self study. I also regained my lost weight and I even gained more than before.

I'm able to focus more on my music production and I get things done faster. My overall creativity has really
improved in every way and I'm finding meaning in life again. 

I really missed my funny jokes and I'm finally able to make my family laugh again. It's as if I'm returning to my true self after 5 years of heavy bong / vape smoking and I got to be honest I almost lost myself mentally and that got me really scared. I'm happy to say that I will never smoke again and it's all because I want to know what life is like without making any bad choices.

I always wanted to quit but my friends simply did not help me so I had to remove them for my life. With weed I have also been battling with porn addiction so I'm now at a point where I want to get clarity in all aspects of life and approach it from a positive perspective where I work on relationships and my mental well-being, something which is truly underrated nowadays IMO.

Now I'm almost 300 euro's richer from not smoking and my suggestion is if you wanna quit weed is to download an app which counts how many days / sessions / money you have saved and it gives you pop ups when you reach a certain milestone with withdrawals such as anxiety and insomnia. This really helps me and boosts my confidence in how far I have come.

My main motivation to stop is to get my life straight. My girlfriend is helping me a lot with that, living together has made smoking less a lot easier for me in the last two years. But I had drawbacks quite often, up to the point of smoking daily all day long again.
After pausing for a month at the end of last year, just to quickly get back to daily smoking, I felt the need to approach the problem in another way. I discussed the situation regulary with her and a lot of my friends, but it was one particular stoner friend who got through to me.

After a long conversation about what is holding me back in life, we both decided to quit smoking once and forever. Deciding on this together and having someone to look up to if you're down helped me a lot for the last three months. Quitting on your own can be hard, especially in (what I call) the depression phase - the first month for me.

I've had the worst dreams after not dreaming at all for a few years. I was deeply depressed about not having access to the thing I've numbed myself with for a decade. I was just bored by my soberness. And last but not least, I was just sad and angry about myself. That, for literally raping a substance that has given me so much joy and pleasure, so that I can't just smoke a joint for fun without the fear of relapsing.

But I got through all of that. My girlfriend, my friends and especially this one friend helped me alot. Now I can say:
I can do this. I have no regrets. It's time to get my life right - and I'm trying to every day, day by day.


I'm happy to have a platform to speak about all this.

It was hard to realize the extent of the control that weed held over my life. Through the past year I have been unmotivated and lethargic. I was content working fast food, coming home, and smoking.

Before COVID-19 I was working as a hotel receptionist for many years but then they had to close all hotels and therefore, let me go. Right after that I had to go to the employment agency because I couldn’t find any job with my mostly just hotels experience. Last month I got my last unemployment benefit while still looking for a job. Also note that they didn’t offer me any job at all.

My dad said he’s going to support me, and he’s paying my apartment expenses like water, gas, etc. and for that I am really grateful but he’s not giving me actual money. Sometimes he invites me over for lunch or my mom does but when it comes to money I could buy smokes or weed with, I don’t have any. And I basically live from the leftover food I have at home.

I am now looking for a job as hard as I can but can’t seem to find any. Either I’m not qualified enough or the job is taken. Today is my first day without weed after smoking it every day for over 10 years and I feel terrible.

Not only I’m stressed from not having anything to smoke but then all the stress from finding a new job and actually starting to work somewhere with all the withdrawals to come. I’m also suffering from daily diarrheas and indigestion so for me to have a new job now is very scary. I really don’t know what to do and it’s really getting to me.

I don't recall anything in specific that drove me to start smoking weed. Funny enough, it became a vital part of my life.

It started when I was about 22, it was offered to me here and there. Then my only friends were my 'weed friends' and finally I only had weed left. 

While reading other posts I noticed a pattern. At every new job or social circle my mind had this recurring idea 'Do they smoke weed'? It's not like I got myself surrounded my stoners at all times, but it had a crucial impact on who I was supposed to talk to. I even ended up hanging out with people I didn't have anything in common. Somehow I needed to make spaces ""weed friendly"". 

When my brother died I didn't know how to cope with it. Each hit felt like the medicine I was not getting anywhere else. In a way, weed gave the enlightenment to see through the rain and, for that, I will always be thankful. It has also helped me with headaches and nausea caused by medicine... that and also how makes food, sex, games and TV so much better... yeah... That's the good side of weed. 

Then there's the dark side of weed. It helps because pain matter less... Then what's linked to that pain matter less... Then you simply don't give a fuck. It puts you in this little box made out of conformism but with a sense of 'wholeness'. Without noticing, you start making compromises and exchanging solutions for tranquility. If you read 'Brave New World', you can compare it to 'soma'.

The tolerance is when you hit rock bottom. Remember when you hit your first joint and thought you were gonna die of laughter? Well, that never comes back, same for the mind blowing sex or the orgasm-like experiences with food. So you start smoking less to get more high. The weed no longer works for you, you work for the weed.

With few exceptions, for the last 11 years, I've been spending my days smoking. I'm not talking 2 or 3 blunts, I mean at least 12-15. My job has been online for a while(before covid) and I can barely sustain it; though now I'm thinking about all the money I'm wasting.   


I used to think that I was a functional high, but it became after a while it became a necessary high. I think I'm just wasting my potential. Weed makes me lazy and always hungry, so I spend a ton on groceries. Every idea I have, I immediately give up on or sit down and smoke about it till I take a nap.   


The Pandemic made me realize in a few ways that I have a problem. I'm always questioning if I can't breathe; which is a problem on its own, but I have to debate whether it's weed or a virus. I've got more time than I know what to do with, and none of my plans get done because when I have free time I smoke.

I thought I was going to be the “buzz kill” to friends who smoke but they say “I’ve given them HOPE” to push them to quit. Again ME!!!!

My co-worker also quit smoking (Day 3) for her.
WE GOT HIGH EVERYDAY. When I mean EVERYDAY it was morning, noon and night! 
It wasn’t good or healthy for the both of us as we are both battling mental health issues.
What’s interesting is once she saw how much more confident, happy and focused I was — she’s wanted THAT HIGH! 
Our clients have even noticed the change. They’ve mentioned that I’m more of an active listener than a glazed out wake and baked potato.

It’s also made me aware of the emotional abuse my  n-mother has dumped on me and how I suppressed it with use of substances.

I’ve cut people who I thought were my friends but we’re really enablers but I can’t blame them. As the saying goes ‘misery LOVES company’. 
SO, I had to speak up and CUT people for their toxicity and unwelcome comments — even my own mother!

I quit 10 days ago cause I started noticing that I just ended up abusing it and not using it for recreational use. 

If you can just put it in you mind that you don’t need it, YOU REALLY DONT NEED IT!! I noticed that the first initial week was hard but once you get pass the first week it does seem to get easier I learn that exercise is very good to help with the withdrawals, but I also learn that some people might just have gone through things that put them in that situation to use marijuana and the best thing to do is express those situations write it down, speak to people about it, learn about why you have anxiety why you are depress find the the main problem, address it, find a solution either fix it or put all that in a box and maybe just forget about it, put it all behind you and start fresh. Quitting doesn’t help if you have all those emotions bottled up. You need to let it go!! Past is the past nothing you can do to change it, only way to make up the past is to better the future!!

Just wanted to share my news with people who care--I was never super open about my usage, and apart from my husband, no one can celebrate with me!

I'm 1 month sober today. I had been a daily user. I wouldn't say heavy user, but frequent, and it was absolutely a problem in my life, so I'm really happy to reach this first big milestone. 

Overall, I feel like the physical symptoms have subsided. I don't have night sweats, nightmares, or brain fog anymore. I do still feel depressed, but I think that's due to more than just not smoking anymore.

Anyway, overall I feel really good--I haven't had much temptation to smoke, apart from today which is funny and ironic. But again, I think it actually has more to do with my relationship with food and weed. I'm a recovering bulimic and the stress of the world has been really tempting to binge until I can't breathe anymore, and I was definitely having some ""nostalgic"" feelings for getting high and eating pure junk.

The first 12 days were absolutely the hardest, from a physical and mental standpoint. 

I have a doctors appointment tomorrow for a general check-up, and I'm really nervous and weirdly excited to feel like for the first time in 8 years, I really am fully living a healthy lifestyle and I hope the feedback I get from my doctor in terms of my physical health, matches how hard I've worked. Not only to kick my habit, but to eat healthfully and mindfully, move my body, and take care of my anxiety and stress as best I can.

2020-10-29 19:45:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jklpt3/8_days_sober/,8 days sober.,"Hi! Your story probably resembles mine. You got introduced to cannabis by a friend/family member, absolutely loved the feeling and thought to yourself “this solves everything! what’s stopping me from feeling like this 24/7?.” And that’s the thing, nobody can stop you but you.

I’ve been an occasional user for about 3 years, since sophomore year. Been high every day all day for the past 1 year, right after getting my heart broken by my first love. Basically just slept my way through senior year (literally and figuratively). Although I felt content and happy, this was far from the truth. Took shrooms a month ago and it felt like a blind was lifted from in front of my eyes. I realized that although bud seemed to be making me happy, it was actually the source of all my problems and sorrows. Easiest way to put it: although it felt like I was moving forward, I was simply running in place. After that, I started researching marijuana addiction/dependence, withdrawl, and it’s effect on the brain. The research in combination with my crazy realization led me to slowly tone down on the good ol’ THC and eventually stopping its use altogether.

This brings us to right now, 8 days sober (I’ve smoked 3 times in the past 2 weeks while slowing down) and I feel like I’m reviving myself. I’ve reconnected with my family and friends, most importantly my little sister. I’ve begun researching and learning things on my own, through books and the internet. I’ve also been improving most of my habits, such as sleeping, eating and working out. My school and work life have also improved. Another plus is the effect I’m having on my smoking friends, most of which tell me that they’re going to try stopping as well (we’ll see).

Smoking marijuana is simply choosing short term gratification over long term gratification. It blinds you from reality and creates a little bubble of fake happiness around you, which bursts as soon as sobriety kicks in. In order to keep this bubble going, you have to keep smoking more and more as your tolerance goes up. This takes a toll on every aspect of your life, financially, emotionally, etc, but you don’t realize it, you just keep looking for the next high. It’s a never ending cycle and the only way out is by stopping. Thank you for reading, and thank you god.

I always looked back on the fun times I had with my friends in HS with fondness; how silly, fun, and loopy we were. But those times only lasted for an instant, and before I knew it, weed just became a plant for me to smoke alone, only for me to retreat to my room and watch Archer for hours. It became a need -- a crutch -- and it sapped away any chance of me ever returning to the initial 'fun' and 'innocent' relationship I once had.

For this reason, I find myself looking back at high school, or even the years beyond that, and thinking about how many times I wasted, how many relationships I damaged, how many lies I told...all to get high. I was somehow able to rationalize my desire for weed not as an addiction, but as a ""treat"" for myself at the end of the day. I lost so much time, and I know it will never return. 

Nevertheless, weed will still always hold a special place in my heart. It gave me lots of laughs, lots of new sensations, and a new way to experience life. But instead of keeping it as an every-once-in-a-while activity, I let it become my new sober, and it ruined me.

I know I can never return to weed and maintain a healthy relationship, so in many ways, I think I'm mourning not only the loss of time that stemmed from weed, but the loss of ever having a healthy relationship with the plant I once loved so dearly. Does anyone else feel this? When I see my friends trying weed for the first time, or smoking every now and then, I feel a twinge of envy. *Why couldn't I have waited to try it? Why couldn't I have been more responsible with my consumption? Why did I let it control me?*

Maybe one day when I'm old and retired, when I know that I've reached my purpose and I know that I've lived my life to my maximum potential, I will take a toke. But until that day arrives -- *if* it even arrives -- I have to move on and restart my journey sober.

Initially I loved the high and the creativity it gave me. As I aged I relied on it for control of my IBS, aches and pains and insomnia.  Lately I decided to quit cold turkey because I was losing my creativity and it no longer interested me. Then I found out just how debilitating that is.  Now mind you I never just smoked a joint. I used a bong with diffusers so I could remove all of the tar before inhaling. Worked great and with the strength of weed these days it usually only took a hit or two.  I recently learned that a quick cessation of pot significantly raises resting heart  rate and blood pressure to dangerous levels. Know that I've done aerobics religiously for over 4 decades. I'm glad I quit but worry about my health now and may end up on blood pressure medication. I'm only a week in so before I seek medical attention I feel I'm going to have to give it more time, perhaps a month or more.

I didn’t start smoking weed until I was in college. At first it was just occasional hit with a friend at their house but soon enough I found myself smoking every day for an entire year. Even when I came home from college during the summer I sunk so much money and time into weed. I was in this terrible cycle of use and I found myself being lazy unmotivated and disconnected to my family and friends because they didn’t smoke or didn’t tolerate smoking. I eventually realized the mistakes I was making and I decided to quit. It sucked, I felt tired, nauseous (which led to me puking in a toilet for 1-2 weeks), had terrible anxiety attacks and pretty bad depression. The worst part was I felt like a total failure and disappointment. I would ball my eyes out thinking I let my family down and I couldn’t control any of these emotions. However I was able to quit and did so for months. That was last year.

I started smoking again at the end of the school year last year and told myself it was a reward for finishing the year and doing well in my classes. That was a huge mistake. The reason I made it so far and did well in school was because I stopped, and I willingly went back in thinking wasn’t going to smoke regularly again but that isn’t what happened. 

I started to smoke regularly again nearing the end of this summer. I continued to do so even as classes started and now with online classes it just made it easier for me to wake and bake. I smoked nearly 5 times a day maybe more during this time. My grades started to suffer again but I didn’t even care. I was setting myself up for failure even after going through this before. I finally got my wake up call when I planned to go on a break to reset my tolerance and that’s when the withdrawals hit me again. I can’t believe I forgot all the pain and suffering that comes along with it. These last few days I’ve been waking up and going straight to the toilet and puking. I have no appetite but I’ve been drinking lots of water and trying to eat healthier. I’m feeling much better than I did just a few days ago and I know it will get better. I also know how much happier ill be as my body adjusts and I need to power through it. This sucks but I know there is light at the end of the tunnel and I’m almost through the worst of it.

2020-10-29 13:59:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jkf2r5/dating_a_smoker_when_youre_trying_to_quit/,Dating a smoker when you're trying to quit?,"Pretty recently I started dating a guy, only after we made it official I noticed that he smoked almost daily. We often smoked together but I figured it was more a weekend thing since he didn't have a bong at home and mostly just smoked joints with me but I realized he goes by his neighbour, where he keeps his bong, up to 5 times a day and also smokes at his friends and really prefers strong bong hits that have a ton of tobacco. Before I decided to quit he didn't want to share joints with me anymore but instead would leave me waiting when he went to smoke his bong, saying basicly that joints didn't give him what he was looking for from weed. He'd usually ask me if it was okay, maybe thinking it made it fine. And since he let me smoke the way I preferred (pure joints) who was i to nag about his preferences even if it did leave me alone on what I had thought to be a date night sometimes for over an hour.

Around the same time his additude to bong hits started to show and bother me I also took an honest look at my own habbits and though I saw them less damaging decided they were damaging enough to quit and have since worked on quitting and recently doing almost ok!

I brought it up, telling him that his smoking was making my attempts to quit harder than I was able to stand and he vowed to not smoke when he's with me. I didn't ask for it, I started the conversation in the mindstate of breaking up but wanted to discuss before making up my mind. Though after our talk I thought it would be fine cause in this manner he wouldn't compromise my quitting. (I relapsed everytime he smoked around me which is why I started to see it as a dealbreaker.)

The thing is it still bothers me that he smokes. It's not jealousy over smoking when I don't(at least I think, it suprises me all the time how wacky addictive thoughts can make us think!) but more that I see how much it effects him. He talks a lot about how active he use to be, how he use to be more motivated and had many objects of interest and also feels depressed. He hasn't smoked for that long, heavily maybe a year but doesn't see the connection with smoking and his amotivation. Often I feel as I'm depriving him something he would otherwise enjoy, he said he'd never choose weed over me, but that's not a race I want to participate in beside the guarantee of winning.

I feel similarly (I think) with my friends. Those that are happy and productive, who seem content with what and how much they are doing on most aspects of life and don't seem stuck or unaible to reach their goals I feel fine hanging with when they are high. But the friends that constantly complain or otherwise let it known they are not where they want to be and especially not anywhere on the path of getting there, I feel horrible around them if they smoke and I don't. Maybe it's due to the fact that weed helped me to be okay with letting my life slip through my fingers and seeing others do the same triggers the earge to smoke.

I've suggested to him it might have something to do with constantly smoking emphasizing that my feelings are based on my own anecdotal experience, maybe it is other stuff or he just isn't ready to move on. I'd like to think this is his problem that he'll deal with when and if he someday sees it as one, I don't really want to meddle without an invitation to do so(but ofcourse would try my best to supoort him if he asks) and I really really don't want a relationship based on ultimatums. The problem is I don't know if I really want a partner who is fine (and/or abusing weed to be fine) with being unhappy.

(I'd compare it to not wanting to date an obese person who is fine with being unhealthy though recognizing it's affects on his life. A long time I thought overweight people just weren't my type and that it was due to attraction to physical traits, but learned that i could be really attracted to a person that was obese but wasn't anymore engaging in ways that were harmful to his health but respected himself and made decisions accordingly all the while reaching his goals and being happy with himself and the life he was living.)

Even if my boyfriend keeps it in moderation, I don't know how I can cope long-term sharing a life with someone who isn't as committed to becoming the best version of himself. Not that someones best version of themselves has to be sober, in his case though it seems to me regural smoking is really in conflict of his goals and not reaching his goals is making him miserable at times.

We've been seeing each other since summer and he has told me that I've helped him with a lot of personal growth. I feel so stupid wanting to hope this growth would lead to him wanting to quit too, or that it would turn out his smoking habit wasn't part of what was holding him back. But I fear that I'd be ultimately grabbing on to that hope if I'd try to be fine with his smoking.

I stopped smoking because I’m really into fitness and weightlifting, and I realized that smoking everyday was having a significant impact on me being consistent with going to the gym and my energy levels overall, and especially my appetite. I could barely feel like I could eat unless I’m smoking. 

So I’m currently on day 6. Sadly enough this is one of the longest times I’ve gone without smoking (purposely) in a longg time. My withdrawal is pretty shitty. I can’t eat much, I’ve been going to bed late, my energy levels are still very low (cause I can’t eat much is definitely contributing) 

I just spoke with my boyfriend who stopped a few days ago and he said he hasn’t been having any symptoms that I’m having. He said it might be because he’s been out and about most of his past few days, and I’ve been home. But I tried to tell him I don’t think my energy levels being low is due to me being home. I’m honestly not in the mood to do anything right now. He also never had a problem with weed affecting his appetite, he’s always been the type of guy that could eat whatever he wanted regardless of if he was high or sober. 

I guess i’m just writing this because i’m frustrated in a few ways. Firstly because I don’t get how he isn’t having my symptoms and he probably thinks I’m just being a baby because he isnt experiencing what i am (and kind of blamed me feeling like crap on myself being home the past few days lol - even though he did clearly state that my experience might be different from his) . Secondly because I wish my appetite was just normal already because I’m sure a part of my low energy and fatigue is due to barely being able to eat. I just wanna go outside and feel normal again but my brain feels like it’s dehydrated. Idk how else to describe my mental state. I have been drinking water but sometimes when I get up I get dizzy.

My story is I'm 27 and ive been progressively smoking more and more weed since I was 21, I was never much into alcohol as to me the cons of alcohol always outweighed the benefits. Weed was different it would make me hungry, made me forget about my problems my emotions, it would help me sleep, movies were better, music was better and apart from maybe gaining weight and eating trash there really wasn't many cons that I saw to it. Now weed was never a problem until I got into a serious commited relationship this is when i started smoking the most i ever have both me and my gf LOVED smoking it became a daily habit quick for us we've been together for over 3 years and and for pretty much the whole relationship we been smoking together. I really feel like we've become too dependent on weed I mean we been smoking A LOT of it for years so it makes sense why we became dependent on it, since march shes been working remote from home and so have I and since than our relationship has taken a turn for the worse progressively these past 7 months it's gotten more and more toxic and I feel like the weed has played a significant role in messing up our relationship, I say this because we've suppressed a lot of feelings by smoking and so forth. Anyway not to get too deep into the relationship thing, I decided to stop smoking on August 19 and I stopped for 40 days and and when i stopped for those 40 days she kept smoking and still smokes to this day, on day 40 we got into a huge argument a bad toxic one and I relapsed and hit the pen, I felt like such a failure all those days that i kept counting I threw it all away just cause of the stress of this relationship, its a very crappy feeling to know you went through all those withdrawals and now you gotta go through them again. I told her the other day how weed has ruined my 20's in the sense that i could have achieved a lot more and it's made me suppress a lot of emotions, and also it made me have a lot of dark thoughts while i smoked,  this obviously led to a another huge toxic argument she told me she never had any dark thoughts on weed, that shes only had positive effects from it nothing negative and that all these withdrawal symptoms such as not eating and sleeping were all in my head, her undermining it really pissed me off.

I've smoked pretty much all day, every day for the last five years - or my entire adult life, so far. I haven't spent a single day sober (unless I was traveling, and even then I complained constantly). I don't really remember how it feels not to be high, versus sober. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, and when I moved from a conservative state to a weed-friendly one I thought I'd discovered my therapy-less, prescription-less cure. But now it's all worse than ever, exacerbated by COVID and being a Black woman in 2020. And the weed isn't helping anymore, if it ever really did. It doesn't quiet my mind the way it used to, it just traps me inside with my thoughts if that makes sense. I feel more alone and suicidal than I ever have before and I didn't think that was possible.

Last night I smoked **The Last Bowl**, having already decided that I can't afford it anymore. I left a little in the bowl to wake up to without admitting it, even though that would ultimately lead to me 'needing' to buy more; that's how my ""one more bowl"" action plan always ends. As I was setting everything back down on my nightstand, the bowl pretty much launched itself out of the bong and fell into a cup of moldy old juice (one of many that's made a home next to my bed). I joked to my sister, ""it's the universe saying THROW THE WEED AWAY!"", but honestly that's really what it felt like.

So I woke up this morning, remembered that I was weedless, threw a little tantrum, and then googled, 'how to get through the day without weed'. And that's how I found my way here. I already feel like this is the part I was missing: a community of people saying ""oh yeah me too. Try again. It'll be okay"". So thanks.

Back in the early 2010s I experienced some pretty deep episodes of depression - it was really bad. Not go to work for a week because I couldn't get out of bed bad. I'm sure it can be worse for others and I sympathize with that. In comparison to what I've experienced in my life it was next level. Despite remaining addicted to pot and alcohol and through will or the grace of nature I've managed to avoid that again. Following those episodes and I do believe through-out my entire life I've had a tendancy to go through cycles were I'll feel elated and ambitious, followed by lower periods where I'm generally sad, unmotivated and not overly optimistic about the future. That might sound a little bi-polar but I don't think its quite that drastic. Maybe this is normal for people, its definitely the norm for me. Being off alcohol now for several years and weed for several months I had hoped I'd avoid this cycle. Quitting alcohol definitely seemed to improve things and they will probably get better without weed in my life as well. 

I'm just rolling off the end of one of those low points, where I had been for the last couple of weeks. My work suffered, my personal life suffered, I suffered. It wasn't fun but every day I put one foot in front of the other and pushed on as best as I could. Today I'm feeling upbeat and optimistic and enthusiastic about the future and getting ready to put my nose back to the grindstone and pick up where I left off in terms of work, my relationships and family, my hobbies and my view of myself. It feels good. I kept reminding myself I wouldn't be stuck where I was. It's either a coincidence or an affect from getting outside of my comfort zone over the weekend and taking on some challenges that I wouldn't normally that caused the pendulum to swing the other direction. I'm curious about that. I'm going to ride this wave of goodness while its here and the next time I experience some lowness I will intentionally push to make a change for the better and see what happens.",5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9567427039146423}"

I just took a hot bath and crawled into bed, even though it was only 7 pm. I really had to just concentrate on relaxing.

During lockdown I decided to take the opportunity to quit for good! Using all of the tools at my disposal (meditation, mindfulness, this amazing Reddit page & a really cool app called Smoke Free) I actually managed to stop smoking for 60 days, an absolute record considering my tenure as a stoner. Throughout my 60 days weed free I felt the best I had felt in years, my moods were so much more stable and I was as productive as I had ever been. That’s when life smacked me in the face.

My girlfriend of almost 4 years told me that she was unsure whether she wanted to carry on with the relationship and needed a bit of time to herself, which turned in to her (pretty much completely) cutting me off for a good 2-3 months. The reason I mention this is not to get into the ins and outs of why this happened, but to highlight that this was the precise moment when I fell back into smoking on a daily, once again.

3 months later, I’m now 3 days sober & starting to feel amazing once again! The reason I’m back here is because this forum was a huge part of coping with my cravings, honestly having the support of others is such a big part of the journey to becoming weed free! 
I’m experiencing slight cravings, but its still early days. I want anybody who reads this to know that no matter how many times you’ve tried quitting, your truest self knows that there is more to life than the next joint, otherwise you wouldn’t be here reading this right?

You quit, convince yourself you can control it 3 months later, and slowly slide back into the daily habit of 2-3gram per day.  


Rinse and repeat.  


The trouble with weed is that it never drags you to the 'terrible lows' of other drugs, but kind of takes you to a place of comfort, destroying your life over the years as you continue to spend money, time and effort on a drug that doesn't serve your growth.  


I am doing OK in life but know that weed is holding me back and I'm smoking to let go of those emotions.  


The first day always comes with an influx of grieve and sadness, followed by dread.  


I smoke to alleviate myself and I'm still stuck here, consciously wanting to quit this substance, but willfully away of the lifestyle change that must come to sustain this long-term.

This time I am struggling to take the first day.  


I think it's the commitment.  


It's  not the fear of quitting.  


It's the fear of relapse.

I was a habitual dab head for around 5 years and was high almost 24 hours a day. I never thought of any consequences to smoking and dabbing but I was wrong.

smoking led me to neglect not only my children but also my wonderful girlfriend. it led me to be mean and just a totally different person than I was before. I didn't remember things and was lazy. I never cooked or cleaned because I was always too high and I didnt help with my kids like I should have. weed isn't 100 percent responsible but it was 100 percent a factor.

recently we broke up and one of my revelations was I needed to quit weed and become the person I was and always meant to be and weed was not helping me do that.

this is day 2 now my last smoke was before work on Monday.  im getting the chills and shakes mind racing loss of appetite and the anxiety panic attacks and random crying are not cool.

I used to love smoking but then it became more like a chore. before I went places. before events. I couldn't leave the house not high.

vision of what his life will be like in the future if he
doesn't clean up his act?

Recently, my grandparents died and their house
became vacant. Still living at home with mum, I saw
this as a good opportunity to transition into living out
of home. I'd have ultimate freedom - I could do
whatever I wanted. I could smoke bongs and
cigarettes in the house, I could order as much take
away as I wanted without the fair judgement of my
mum. I could have an entire study to work from
home in and set up my guitar and my playstation and
all of that. There was just one catch: my 50 year old
uncle.

A tall, skinny and sickly pale man answered the door
and waived with yellow, nicotine-stamped fingers
towards the room I'd be staying in. The inheritance
he received became obvious when he smiled - I
had never seen him with teeth before and these ones were brand new. Track marks polkadotted his arms and I'd never seen someone be so white and so red at the same time. 

I walked through my childhood second home for the first time in a while and got to the kitchen before I realised that this wasn't grandma and grandpa's anymore. 

A white russian milk trail lead from the kitchen bench to the lonely grey ikea couch parked smack in the middle of a too-big living room; a crease sat on one side of it. 7mate, I believe it was Pawn Stars, blared on the TV screen. The huge windows that the sun set into were covered by black blinds so as to maintain total isolation from the neighbours while also extremely effectively trapping the heat in. Rings from the bottoms of cups of god knows what patterned the table like an abstract art piece, if only said piece was used as one giant plate to chop weed on. 

A foul smell of rotting meat emanated from a dirty pan I walked into the kitchen. The recycling bin was full to the brim of bottles and  flattened cardboard cases that they came in along with maybe 14 uber eats bags. The bin was full of take-out food. Not old takeout food, yesterday's takeout food. Full containers. The sink was chock full of shite. This was going to be an easy life. 

It smelt like 4 days of no showering, 6 cigarettes an hour and about 30 years of mental decay. 

I hadn't seen my uncle in years. My dad kept him away from us. 

We caught up, finally two adults instead of uncle and nephew. It took one conversation for me to know everything I needed to know about him. 

You see, we weren't so different, him and I. 

I liked my me-time. So did he.

I liked to moan about people and so did he.

I liked more than anything to just get high and do my own thing at home, and so did he. 

And that's what we did. 

I can't really describe why I always feel so attracted to the idea of being able to smoke inside. It's kind of like the *ultimate* stoner move - I don't even have to leave my couch right now. I can get away with maybe 100 steps today. Yeah, I thought that sounded like a life. So did he. 

He is without a doubt, unquestionably the most pathetic man I've ever met in my entire life. I'm not even slightly exaggerating. 

He's smart, even funny some times. He's tall, he's blonde, he's privileged. He had the whole world in his hands when he was about my age. 

He obviously went to greater extremes than you or I would, but in this situation, it wasn't really the journey but the destination. 

He wakes up, smokes a joint, drinks himself to sleep by 1pm, wakes up, does the same thing, almost like he has 14 mini-days each week. He bitches, he moans, he blames, he complains, he mopes, he self deprecates, he hates himself and he does fucking nothing about it. He sits there and smokes and drinks and smokes and drinks and tells me the same story he told me this morning and the night before and the morning before that as if it's the first time he's telling me. He cries. He's unemployed. He stinks. He looks homeless. 

He had mountains of opportunity and people that loved him. That is what he chose to do with it. He makes little wise cracks daily, little snide remarks that make him feel better about his own miserable  cry-wank of an existence. He subtly talks shit about how my mum never liked him and I never used to like it when she talked badly of him but now I get it because she's right.

I moved in here 6 weeks ago extremely excited to finally live freely and do exactly what I wanted, when I wanted. 

I'm leaving tomorrow three days sober. 

Don't be like my uncle. He fucking sucks.

To be honest, I wasn’t totally 100% sure that I will see through quitting but I knew for sure that I had to just do it. Making big promises and sweeping statements, like “I will really stop now until forever” has never worked for me. So just doing it and making little steps daily was a new strategy and so far, I’d say it’s working quite well! Each day that passes my resolve to quit is stregthened and I find healthier ways to manage myself.

Today, day 7, has been the hardest by far! It’s not the cravings per se. But the emotional and pyschological baggage that I unearth as I think through the reasons of why and what made me want to smoke up in the first place. Yet there’s no guilt. No shame. Only compassion and understanding for myself. I guess this is what they mean with loving yourself fully, noh? I did what I could to overcome the adversities thrown my way and weed became a crutch of sorts. My weed journey is turning out to be a humbling lesson of self acceptance.

I want to quit, but everytime I try convincing myself to quit I'm stuck with the ""what's the point? Why?"".
I tried going a couple days without smoking, and it kind of worked as long as I kept myself very occupied with other things (preferably things where smoking isn't even an option - like hanging out with friends who despise weed or doing some activity that requires me to be in an environment where I can't smoke). But as soon as I'm bored (and I get bored very easily) my mind starts planning the next smoke session.

When I don't smoke, I feel pretty good, I have energy and a good ""base happiness"". When I smoke, I'm apathetic and get dissociative scares (like ""omg these don't feel like my hands, wtf!"" for a couple seconds) and my brain is just mush.
Even though I know that I want to quit, I'm also very good at convincing myself that I don't really want to quit.
It's like I need to constantly occupy my mind with something else to be able to stay away from the weed at all - the smallest boredom and I'm already convinced that I might as well be high. I can't find enough things to distract myself with for a long period of time that I don't eventually bake smoking into. 

I started building aquariums a year ago to get a hobby. But then I started to bake smoking into it like - ""I'll just roll one while I wait for the salt to dissolve properly"" or ""It's good for the water to stabilize before I start adding it - better smoke some before"". It's like I'm using weed as a measurement of time.


Now I'm soon (hopefully) omw to an addiction help facility. Planning the trip there is at least the furthest I've come to a long term solution. I've thought about looking it up for over two years, but I was convinced that they'd be all like ""yeah, all drugs are the source of all evil and destruction in the world, you must quit NOW and never ever even think about taking any drug ever again!"" And the thought of never getting to smoke again makes something inside me panic, and I start thinking that I just want to cut down a little which leads me to think that I don't actually have a problem and therefore I shouldn't seek help.
Hopefully I get to the place, and hopefully they'll not scare me away.


Thanks for reading this long rant, I felt like I needed to share my conflicting thoughts somewhere I might find others who can understand the struggle of taking the first step.

Was on anti depressants for most of that time as well. My tolerance for weed grew and since I live in a state where it’s legal it was always at my disposal. I smoked expensive OG all day everyday and told myself plenty of successful people do it. I still functioned and have always been fit. I’m a runner, weightlifter,and I do a lot of Mui Thai. I decided when covid hit to ween off my medication. Something I was never able to do particularly because I did it in a rush usually. It was at least a 3 month withdrawal and couldn’t believe I was actually doing it. On the other hand I was smoking more weed but I already smoked a lot so just more then normal. I always planned on quitting and have for a few months here and there in the past. Never easy but I was at least on pills to feed some extra dopamine. This time I knew would be more difficult but I wasn’t ready. 
2months off meds at this point. One day I bought an 80 dollar eighth of some of the best OG I had ever smoked and smoked like 3 bowls. A light went off in my head and I gave the rest of it to my friend and said get rid of this. I’m quitting. I wasn’t even sure if I believed it myself. I wanted to have a better sex life. I wanted to have better relationships. I wanted to not look high and dumb anymore. I didn’t want to hack up my lungs everyday. The first month I had very low sex drive. Lower then when I took meds and smoked all day. Still had a drive then but wasn’t turned on easily. The second months started to improve the slightest bit. 3 month much better then the first two. I’ve always been a bit of a puss when it came to life and wanted to hid from it with meds and weed. Things happened to me last year that affected my self worth and self esteem. I’m grateful those things happened which is still hard to admit but if they didn’t I may have waited another 8 years hiding. Or I may have never stopped. I know I’m not going back on weed or pills. The pills were easy to ween off. The weed was a nightmare as many here know. I’m still getting there as far as state of mind and everything but I look so much better and I actually enjoy the little things.

I just feel hopeless about everything at this point in my life tbh. I resorted to getting high cuz I've had a shitty hand dealt to me and once upon a time it helped. I crashed my car today cuz I've just been in a haze. A haze from smoking a lot the day before and of general sadness. This is how I go about most of my days but I was very inattentive for the wrong moment. Everyone's ok but I use my car for the job I hate. I kinda hope they fire me if it falls apart even more so I can just get on with losing all that I have and move far away tbh. That's where my life has always seemed to be headed. Anyway.

I'm 30 years old, started smoking everyday since I was 13.
Most of my life I've been 'high' 
I've dabbled in the idea of quitting a few different times in my life but nothing seems to stick. (No pun intended)
I had my longest stint last year, I quit for a solid 5 months. I started doing more activities, excelling at work and saving money.

But then Christmas came. I went on a mini holiday and got out of my 'healthy' routine. 
Thought, no worries, I'll just pick up where I left off and then boom!!! Covid hit... No work, no activities.
My gf, who I live with also smokes quite heavily started smoking everyday again, so naturally (with nothing to do) I joined her.
Well it's been about 10 months since I started again and I felt like I wasted the whole year. I could of used this time to practice a new skill or literally do anything else.
So on that note, im throwing out all my smoking stuff and starting again. 
Huge thank you to this sub, I've been a long time lurker and reading all the posts makes me feel like I'm 'normal' and not the only one.

I’ve gone through a lot of what I assume is withdrawal symptoms from my stomach bubbling for the first month, my right knee aching for over 3 weeks, and a cough with phlegm feeling on my chest but haven’t coughed any up.

I’ve got bloodwork done, EKG, ultrasound on stomach, chest x ray and for the most part everything looks good. 

Currently what I’m still going through is having anxiety, random moments throughout the day where I feel the urge to cough, feels like there’s a hole in my chest still, i don’t know if what I’m feeling in my chest is my lungs healing still or what. For the last two days I’ve had what I think others refer to as brain zaps on the right side of my head above right ear, very random throughout the day. My heart sometimes feels like it’s racing for no reason but i don’t know.. that could be from anxiety, I notice it most when laying down. 

My main concern still is probably the chest feeling but the chest x ray on lungs didn’t see anything so I’m assuming it’s from withdrawal. 

I’m hoping by 3 months that the chest sensation will be gone and I’ll be fairly good physical symptom wise, I can handle the anxiety and depression feeling but the physical symptoms give me health anxiety and make me think that there’s something seriously wrong with me.

I take medical marijuana for my chronic pain. I used to be on opiates and was full on addicted, so I know the cycle. I see the signs with my marijuana use and it scares me.

I have lived with my pain for 13 years. Marijuana is the only thing besides pain pills that takes the edge off.

At the same time, it doesn't work anymore. When I started, I could take one 9mg pill and be good for the day. Now, I take four and it's *nothing*. I took seven in a day on Sunday and it was like I hadn't taken anything at all. I am desperate for relief from my pain, so I keep on taking more and more...and then I end up completely anxious. Getting it through a dispensary is also ridiculously expensive. 

Every time I have had a mental breakdown, I was high. It really amplifies my anxiety and I am sick and tired of being so paranoid. I don't know what to do anymore.

Once I realized Cannabis has 0 value, none whatsoever, that being high was a drag on life and made me ridiculously unproductive, the benefits of quitting were just too great to ever justify smoking again.   Its been easier not to smoke than to smoke because being sober made me realize how much weed was actually affecting my life. Here are some benefits that I experienced in my tenure of being 100% clean and sober.

1.My performance at work has been tremendous, I have been hitting my daily sales targets every day and even exceeding what is expected of me which is great because I also earn commission

2. My workouts have reached another level, I was always fit per say, at least more than the average person, but this month I have been killing it at the gym and even at home. I used to workout for 20-30 mins on average but I have been pushing myself to workout for at least 1-1.5 hours now (6 times per week instead of 5).

3. My diet has been wonderful, without the munchies, I have been eating good and nutritious home cooked food. I am no longer too lazy to cook so I do not opt for uber eats or some other junk. I have completely cut snacks out of my diet because I just no longer crave them because Im no longer high.

4. My relationship with my family has never been better. I can go over to my folk's home, play with my younger siblings, listen to my parents and actually spend quality time with my family. I was always too occupied with getting high to ever visit them and actually spend quality time with my parents and siblings. I also began to call my grandparents daily and they live in another country hours ahead of Canada, so I rarely called them because I would always be high at night (morning for them) and I did not want to disappoint them by calling them half-baked.

5. Money, money, money. Who knew saving 200-300$ per month was a great thing?

That is all for now. I am only 23 and being sober was the best thing I ever done for myself.

Something I have not been enjoying, however, is what I can only describe as severe gut/indigestion/nausea since I quit. The worse part is well, erm, let’s just say nothing stays solid afterward. 

I eat relatively healthy, drink plenty of water, and herbal teas; and since I’ve been dealing with this issue I’ve increased probiotic foods/salads/less caffeine, no sugar etc., yet the only things that seem to help or “stay” normal in my bod are salads and ginger based teas. 

I’ve read reports that prolonged use of weed is known to cause gut issues in a small portion of the population that smokes, but I guess I wanted to hear straight from the horses mouth if any of you have experienced this, either now, or in the past.

Day 1 again, but I’m feeling more capable. Maybe I can go for a month this time, or even more. Inevitably, I see it as I’m bound to relapse, but that doesn’t discredit the constant effort I’ll have to put in to kick this thing once and for all. I’ve noticed that a huge part of this battle (for me, at least) is developing more positive self talk that reinforces that this thing is a monstrous addiction, built up by my ignorance of my own feelings and capabilities over a long period of time, and I very well might mess up again once or twice...

My pregnancy was unexpected and happened during Covid of course so life was already kind of weird and was getting hard. I have issues with my family of origin, basically controlling, demanding parents who make everything all about them and who have ruined my previous pregnancies and made my pregnancy losses worse with their selfish behavior. I am almost positive this is my last baby and wanted to make sure I could have as smooth of a pregnancy as possible and keep my parents at bay (I am over halfway there and haven't told them bout the pregnancy- I live far away and haven't gone to see them due to Covid. I am not sure when I will tell them, if at all, because in therapy I'm deciding whether to cut them out completely or keep trying to keep them limited contact although sometimes even that brings me anxiety, etc.)   


I had so much anxiety at first, due to this pregnancy being unplanned and being worried about finances, as well as memories/fears of my prior pregnancy losses and also the fact that pregnancy seems to trigger old memories about my parents and upbringing and such. I sought counseling and have been learning Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I have been reading about toxic parents and self-love and I feel I've been learning and growing a lot thanks to being ""forced"" to find different coping mechanisms and lifestyle changes now that I don't do weed. FYI I also stopped drinking over 4 years ago because it was interfering in my life and my husband almost died of pancreatitis so he can no longer drink at all and I wanted to support him. A combination of MMJ and anti-depressants and therapy and SMART Recovery meetings (like AA but secular and science based) helped him a lot and all of the same things helped me too except for anti-depressants which I never went on.   


I was afraid that if I wasn't using weed I'd want to go back to drinking and I was also afraid that because he does it a lot, I'd be too tempted to be able to stop, but that hasn't been the case. TBH I am grateful that weed helped us kick worse habits and I would much rather have him do that than drink. But for myself personally I have only been inspired to get healthier and happier since stopping weed. At the same time, sometimes I feel a lot more anxiety or depression, with no ""easy"" way to escape/mask it, but I think that being sober helps me feel those feelings and listen to them better and deal with them instead of just continuing to escape from them.   


I never drank or did any drugs in high school because I was raised in a fundie Christian environment and was a super good girl but once in college I started drinking and by graduate school I had become somewhat of an alkie and experimented with other drugs and I never even liked weed because it was too much of a ""downer"" until I stopped drinking and couldn't do harder drugs due to having kids and probably due to not having anywhere to get them anymore, ha. My lifestyle really changed from that of a partier to that of a homebody/mom and weed helped me escape my problems without having to go out and do dangerous things. But it also kept me from exploring my emotions and growing as a person, I think. I realize now that I was using some kind of substance to mask my pain for my entire adult life and even though I sometimes had breakthroughs or worked on things I could never completely deal with them right due to purposefully putting my brain in a fog.  


I sometimes wonder if eventually I might do it now and again at night or if we go out for a special occasion in the future because it used to help me sleep (I have anxiety-induced night terrors) and I also can't imagine being completely sober while everyone else is partying (I have social anxiety and am an introvert but when I drank I became the ""life of the party"" and with weed I mostly could just chill out and relax better around people although sometimes it did make me paranoid or depressed- same as alcohol I guess), but other than that I definitely don't ever want to go back to being a daily/all the time user. And maybe I won't ever feel like doing it again because it feels pretty cool to not need anything at all to deal with life head on. I am hoping I can somehow deal with my anxiety issues and feel more comfortable in my own skin and around people without needing weed, and in some ways I feel I'm already learning to do that. Also I am working to accept myself for who I am and when I was a kid I used to love being by myself just reading books and writing stories so it's okay that I'm not the extroverted type who likes to go out and have a ton of friends but I do want to work on deepening my connecting with a few good friends.

Then I got the brilliant idea to play it high.

Took a couple puffs and then got cozy in my seat. It started out fun but then as I went about my way thinking of what next to master and how much time I needed, I asked myself why I devoting so much time to a fictional character and neglecting myself.

I admired how ripped the dude was knowing full well I could start working out at any minute. I collected books and learned different spells but refused to read the real books I had not two feet away and never followed up on my goal of learning a second language.

I realized it was because it was so much easier to commit time to a game than IRL. Time itself was easier to comprehend, an hour was a day, getting 8 hours sleep was a click of a button, I never had to worry about eating or drinking water.

I joined the military at 22 and one of the good things about that it is that it forces you to stay off weed.  I drank like a fish during that time, however.  I got out of the military four years ago and I began smoking daily almost immediately and I've rarely stopped since, even though I've hated myself for my addiction and wanted to stop badly.  For much of that time, including early in COVID, I was a wake and bake stoner.  

I recently moved to Washington DC and I'm glad I did.  I lived in California and Oregon for the past four years, and the temptation of driving past dispensaries was too much for me.

It was one of the most prominent moments of my life. When I got home I started to think of my journey, and I want to share my story with this great community.

If you don't feel like reading a long boring backstory, please skip to the insights I have made. I would love to get more input and to grow this community.

It feels really weird posting here. I have been ghosting on this sub for a few years. I am a student teacher , and where I stay I would work for a few months then I would have a month holiday 4 times a year. This created a viscous cycle where I would go cold turkey for my working months and indulge when I have holiday. I would love the sensations of getting high, but like clockwork I will start regretting it exactly 8 days later.

I have read many times on this sub that when you don't smoke you think of getting high and when you do smoke you think of getting sober. This brainloop was consistent. The funniest thing for me was being in such strong denial about it. I said that I can do it in moderation this time, or I'm young its okay to get high. This has proven to fail every time and I would just dig deeper into my depression.

The biggest thing that scared me was  the thought of living a life without having to get high. When you are lonely and you start smoking, Its like saying hello to a friend. I didn't have any friends where I was working and It was more fun to get high all the time. Having that ""presence"" of mindfog was my only company. When I was sad he would listen and when I was bored I could just smoke and find something to do. But it was a toxic relationship.

A year later and things have improved drastically. I am more happy and satisfied. I want  to share some insights into my journey with everyone, so please give this a read :)

&#x200B;

* Don't be too hard on yourself. Forgive yourself when you make a mistake. This doesn't mean that you must start smoking every time you feel like forgiving yourself, but be honest with yourself and your intentions. When I accepted my addiction and tried to stop as an act of self love, it sticked.
* I know you are afraid of living a life where you can't imagine it being worth living when you don't smoke. You think to yourself that everything is better when you smoke. Food, movies, sex. How can a sober life be worth it? My advice is to do it for yourself and see. Feeling happy in the moment but emotionally killing yourself in the long run is like putting a band-aid on a festering gun wound. Being powerful is knowing many mindsets at once. If you can sacrifice these small moments of instant gratification, you create a long-term fulfilment that is worth living.
* Things don't just magically change when you stop smoking, but you start to see the destructive habits that you choose to ignore. For me it was not dealing with issues I have created for myself growing up. I hated myself for my porn addiction. I hated not being assertive enough. But rather than doing anything about it, I would just smoke and think about it all the time.
* Get something that works for you. Growing up I realized everyone has something they believe in to make their lives meaningful. Whether that something is religion, art, sport or simply a hobby. Get something that you truly enjoy, and pursue it. Give it all your attention and make sure it is something that is fulfilling. For me it was mindfulness training and it single handedly changed my life. If you are reading this and you don't know where to start,  read about mindfulness practice. I honestly believe that this is the best thing you can do for yourself. The first step you can take to know yourself is by truly looking within.
* Lastly, reconnect with people. Many smokers believe that they are introverts and they don't like or need people. Humans are an incredibly deeply rooted social species. When I smoked it was all I could think of doing, every task seemed mundane. Now I find pleasure in speaking with people. Ask yourself, is it worth it to be anxious all the time when you are in social situations? The freedom you give yourself when you stop smoking cannot be underestimated. Say hi to your co-workers and ask them how was their weekend. Call your mom and dad and say hi. You don't know how much longer time you can spend with them. I'm not saying its that easy to create human connection, but I can say that you can give yourself the opportunity to try.

Last night was the hardest one so far of this sobriety.  I got little pieces of 20 minute sleep here and there, but wanted so badly to just fall into a deep slumber, It just would not happen no matter what I tried.  Breathing, reading, playing nature sounds on a speaker in the corner of my room, a hot bath, a warm milk, nothing would soothe me for very long.

Finally at 5:30 I got up and went for a run, this has made me feel alot better.  During the night I wanted to give up, smoke a joint and give in to what I know would sedate me.  But then I thought about how eventually It would stop working in what I seem to be a beneficially way and keep me up in its own manner.  I yearn to find what I consider a normal routine, and I believe that will come in time.  However, I am realising now that I have to listen to my body, I did rest In a way and the reality is the only thing making me feel good now is staying active.  I'm not even tired, I'm wide awake and focused in a way that doesn't seem possible.

It's an emotional rollercoaster, like many say.

I literally quit every day, but also have also been smoking daily, still. I'm lucky if I can make it 24 hours, which I have, a couple times this week, and made it 48 sometime last week. I'm using the app with the growing acorn (grounded™) to track my quit attempts. I used it last year when I quit for around 2-3 months around this time, until my last grandparent died and I relapsed in grief. It's real easy to feel negative each time I relapse, but that really only makes me want to smoke a little more. I try to see the positive instead which can kill the urge; I'm smoking 1-2 dabs/pen-hits a day instead topping off throughout. Definitely an improvement, and I am harboring the intention to quit much more throught the day/daily than in the past.

There's an Anthony Bourdain quote that goes, ""I understand there's a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons and old movies. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid, and **outwit**, that guy,"" and I relate so hard to that lately. I wake up with a wake-and-bake urge and try to outsmart myself and put it off until i hit the pillow. TBH I have been able to reduce my use significantly. I'm just trying to push past that 24 hour mark, because I'm plateauing there right now.

My motivation is to move from a current day-job to a career-job I am finishing school for, which should be easy, EXCEPT that I would not pass a drug test. I use medical-grade concentrates 100% legally and medically, but for reasons you all probably know as well, many workplaces drug test to maintain a ""drug-free workplace"" in the US, and can discriminate against THC use. Nicotine, too (u-haul, intel...). Obviously you can't come to work drunk, but boy is there a workplace full of ""functional"" alcoholics. I'm increasing the amount of phys. therapy I do by hours/week. And popping ibuprofen/tylenol almost daily. IMO I'm trying to grow from upper-lower-class to lower-middle-class and THC is my barrier.

Pride+power+ignorance= a deadly mix. 2 weeks sober and here it what I learned.,"Hey guys thanks for stopping by to read. I wanted to touch base on this thing call denial. I have seen so many post on here and I’m here to tell you denial can be your worse enemy. It’s easy to say “I’m not addicted” or “I can quit anytime” until it comes down to the day to quit. So many times I sat down and would feel so miserable and exhausted from smoking all day. I would tell myself over and over I want to quit. I can quit whenever I want. But everytime I went to do it something always would give. Whether it was a bad day, a fight with my husband, or something negative on the news I would always find a reason to go back to it. My pride would get the best of me. Pride almost ran me into the ground because I refused to admit I had a problem. This last time I had quit things had to change. I couldn’t keep telling myself I was going to do it and then back right out. I threw all my paraphernalia in the trash and watched the garage truck take it away. One of the hardest decisions of my life. The thing about weed is it makes you feel you have power over your problems when you actually don’t. Ignorance is another issue I struggled with during my addiction to weed. These three things equaled a deadly mix that almost destroyed myself. I truly felt I could not function unless I was high. This was a lie I believed for so long. But there I said it. It was a lie. I was in denial. I know it’s hard to quit. I know withdrawals suck. I know that it’s lonely sometimes and you will have set backs. Keep fighting. Keep trying to quit. Keep trying to better your life. Don’t give up. You are strong. You are courageous. You can do ANYTHING you set your mind to. I’m two weeks in and I am finally starting to sleep good. My appetite is back. I’m happy and life feels normal. I’m not hiding away and staying disconnected anymore. I have joined a celebrate recovery group to connect with those who struggle with the same habits and hang ups. Get connected.

Before you go running in the cold just to smoke outside while your anxiety fills your head with the thought of catching pneumonia... you’re smart, you know the way that you smoke will have it’s consequences even more than the ones you live through now.  Before you decide your life is not worth fighting for, reconsider all the experiences you have yet to live and decide wether your health, peace of mind and future are valuable to you. You only have one life, 27 years lived and I ask you today, how do you want to spend another 27? Do you have the will to live and to change your life radically? To get what you’ve never had? Are you ready to be a new person? Then don’t ride your bike to the hood today.

Earlier on in Pandemic Times I was diagnosed with ADD (ADHD-I to be fancy about it) and it was a game changer. It explained a lot of the things I was struggling with and things I had chalked up to depression, and also helped put my relationship with MJ in context. Realized that, independent of anything else, I’d definitely been self medicating with it and using it to mask / cope with some symptoms. Been working with a therapist and got on medication and its made a huge difference. 

I’d been delaying “retiring” from this routine at the start. It was a lot of change already and this was a thing I’d relied on and felt helped get me through situations that were really hard for me, ya know? But I’m at the point now where it’s pretty clear this is holding me back from becoming the person I want to be and definitely limiting my ability to manage and improve upon my ADD, so it’s just gotta go. 

Bracing myself, know these first few hours and days are going to suck, but looking forward to finding out what the experience is like along the way and then on the other side of things. Gotta come at it curious and open right?

Today is a decent day. I still have some brain fog and I'm really not feeling very well, but it's also that time of the month for me, and ever since I quit, it's been the worst PMS of my life. I can't leave my bed without getting dizzy. But I'm trying. 

I had some therapy work done for the extreme anxiety and panic, and I feel like a totally different person today. We did some NLP for the trauma I experienced while losing my son. It's crazy how much you can mask with pot, or anything for that matter. 

The root of my anxiety was the fear that I was going crazy. Everytime my head felt heavy due to the brain fog, or the hearing was weird because of the withdrawal, I would freak out thinking ""omg, I'm crazy. I've lost it. I'm going to be admitted"" and it would spiral from there until it turned into a full blown panic attack. I have been stuck in flight or fight mode since day 1 of quitting pot. I finally have relief. 

Besides feeling like death from being a woman, I haven't felt much anxiety all day. Seems like flight or fight is finally turned off and I can enjoy some things again. I think if you're still experiencing debilitating anxiety, there is a root you need to address. Weather it's fear, trauma or both, it shouldn't be so bad. Once that's cleared up, you can really focus on trying to feel better while recovering from your addiction. 

This really is the hardest thing I'm sure all of us have been through, but I keep reading from others that it truly does get better. And I hold on to that day in and day out.

Before I started smoking at 16, I was a dorky person. I LOVED Disney and musicals. I loved Broadway and singing and theatre. I loved to dance. I was an active member of my junior high schools chamber choir. I had great breath support. I loved Doctor Who, Sherlock, Supernatural, and other now cringe-worthy cult tv shows. I loved the fandom side of tumblr and canon theories. I loved playing video games, especially combat based games. I was really into Halo, Skyrim, and Destiny. I was teased in school about it and I hated myself back then. Until now. I was unapologetically me, even if I was bullied for it. Then I started smoking and gradually moved away from who I was and the people who brought out that person in me. I started trying to be like everyone else. I started hanging out with people who smoked, listening to music that was about smoking. My whole person became centered around weed. Even though I touted that I was so much more than a pot head, everything and everyone around me was somehow related to weed. Even my parents liked me more when I was a stoner. And I was totally cool with that, like I didn’t care because I was blissfully stoned all the time. I was thinking about this last night while taking a hot bath but I didn’t put too much thought into it because it made me sad. I feel much better today, and I’m filled with a bittersweet feeling. I started reconnecting with my old self a few days ago and it’s so nice. I find myself enjoying video games, and seeking them out instead of feeling forced into it by my fiancé, who also loves video games. I’ve been listening to old musical soundtracks and I can’t help but sing along. I have this feeling of wanting to watch the old tv shows I used to love. I miss my old friends and have tried to reconnect with them, though they want nothing to do with me. Understandably so, considering I just ghosted them to hang out with my stoner friends. 

This realization has just helped solidify my determination to never smoke again. I don’t want to lose that person again. I miss her.

What began as a once in a while diversion eventually became a daily habit.  Over my years of usage, I transitioned from smoking to vaping potent variates with such names as Ghost Train and Brownie Scout, sometimes a few times a day, sometimes even in the morning when I woke up.  I knew my habit was becoming a problem a few years ago, but the escape weed provided became a necessary means of relieving boredom, and dulling the intense anxiety and frustration I was feeling.  Like so many here, I tried to stop any number of times, but went back to using, promising myself that I could handle it and use it only occasionally.  It never worked out that way.  Before today, the longest I had ever abstained was around two weeks but today I see myself approaching a month of being sober.  At Day 27 I am still struggling with mild headaches and some ""brain fog"", but each day I am becoming more and more clear, and facing my frustrations ""head-on"".  I am realizing that weed was not helping, it was actually making things far worse!!!  For those just starting out, yes the first few weeks are the most difficult.  It is not just the headaches, or what I call brain fog, lack of motivation, depression and self questioning, it is finding something to fill the void of the ""ritual"" you are leaving behind.  It is breaking old unhealthy habits and finding new ones.  In fact, at Day 27, that remains the hardest part for me; getting active and not trying to do the same things I did while I was stoned, i.e. watching You Tube.    At Day 27, I am more hopeful than ever, not just about quitting a horrible habit that has robbed me of years of my life, but of finding new and interesting things that are far more rewarding then puffing on a vape pen and watching Netflix.  I had someone tell me recently that to recover I needed a ""Why"".  That person had no idea of how the question of ""why"" would change my perspective on my addiction.  My why at age 56 is simple.  It is to reconcile a difficult childhood and accept the successful person I am as an adult without seeking the approval of a dysfunctional family; my Why is to embrace myself and enjoy without question the activities I enjoy, and to live life being authentic about who I am rather than being wrapped up in what I think I should be;  my why is to be present!!!

After smoking every day for 8 years, since I was 16, I've finally had enough.

 
Based on the wisdom of this sub, and some common sense, I knew I needed to replace smoking with something else. Sitting around all day ""not smoking"" is not an effective way to quit (for me at least), so instead I've been exercising, reading, and focusing on eating healthily.

Not even 5 hours into my day and I'm already full of excuses. I went for a run, did all the work I needed to for this morning, and then thought ""well I've been more productive today than I usually am when I smoke, maybe I can do both"". Once I let those thoughts in, it's like a tiny hammer chipping away at my resolution not to smoke.

Tonight I plan to make a healthy meal, have all my ingredients ready etc. and I'm already telling myself ""you're more likely to enjoy your healthy dinner if you smoke a little before hand."" which is not true. If I smoke, I'll end up ordering takeout and the healthy ingredients will never get eaten.

So I won't do it. I am aware that my brain has adapted to the comfort of being high every day, and so will do everything it/I can think of to get that comfort back, like a baby screaming for a blanket. 

I know it will get easier, so I won't trick myself into giving up.

I suffer from some childhood issues that have affected me growing up as well as hormonal issues and PMDD, so weed has always been a miracle for me, but I’ve overdone it. The past few months have shown me being high CONSTANTLY. It was so bad that I would even take a shot of alcohol to enhance or lengthen my high because I just don’t feel THC like I used to. I can’t smoke once or twice a day anymore because I can’t cope with real life. That’s why I need to quit. Just being married two weeks ago, my husband deserves more than a lazy, high wife. I want to finally get my career off the ground and be a mom one day and while weed seemed to help me achieve that at first, it just seems to be adding to the problem these days. 

My husband even seems to get annoyed at me for being high lately. He wanted me to call room service on our honeymoon while he showered and I was just always too high to do so.

-I don't feel regretful and dreadful all the time. I'm not looking forward to just being high and getting as much pleasure as possible.

-When high nothing ever felt good enough, I would seek pleasure constantly and I would eat like shit because I would be too tired to cook food for myself and my stomach would ache really bad because of eating sweets.

-I can be more social when sober, more sharp in conversations and more interested, and I don't feel the need to withdraw from people just to go smoke by myself and isolate.

-Emotions. I feel so energetic at times and listening to music makes me want to jump. I feel more genuine and at ease with myself.

-Sleep. I'm still recovering but dreams and sleep feels great. I love that I don't need weed to sleep anymore, although I do sometimes wake up from minor nightmares and it takes some time to sleep again.

These are just some things I've noticed. Currently on 7th day and feeling good about this.

I've been dealing with a repulsion to food in the past two days, which I expected.

Today I woke up and within an hour or so I began to throw up. I hadn't even eaten anything yet, so it was just painful dry heaves and stomach acid. I wasn't able to keep anything down (I tried some pasta, and tiny sips of water) for the next three hours, at which point I had a tums, thinking it would help but I threw that up too. I had a hot bath, and it just made the symptoms worse. 

The only thing I've been able to keep down today is some Gatorade and some chicken noodle soup. Still having lots of stomach aches and upset. 

Has anyone else had this intensity of nausea when quitting? I've also been having hot and cold flashes.

   A little background on me: my family has a long history of addiction and I like to think I'm lucky that my addiction lies in weed rather than alcohol like many family members, or even heavier drugs.. I suffer with CPTSD and weed has definitely helped me through some extremely traumatic situations, that being said I think it's not helping as much as hindering.
   I'm 25 years old (female) and never did drugs in highschool, I was just a sugar fiend and a nut job. Then I went to college across the country, things were good, then I went through a really bad break up and I was separated from a lot of people I care about. So I kinda did the classic start experimenting, alcohol never rwally agreed to well with me.. But I fell in love with how weed felt.. This was in 2015, I started slow, getting a gram and that would last a long time, like 2 weeks, I was toking on weekend evenings with a roommate. Fast forward a few months and I'm dating that roommate (still am) and smoking weed daily. Summer of 2015 was so lonely, all I had was music, a shitty café job with coworkers I couldn't relate to, and weed. Since 2015 there's probably been a total of 2.5 or less months I've been sober, and multiple reasons for quitting and then going back to weed because I thought I was fine and could handle it..
  So now, after multiple close family members have fallen down HARD due to drugs, traumatic events around those people, yadda yadda...
I haven't had a job in 2 years because of panic attacks and I think the weed is causing me to dissociate almost 24/7 and forget things that I don't really want to forget.
I wake up and toke twice throughout the night, then in the morning to start my day I toke, and before bed I toke..
    I'm at a point where I want to live a life again, I want to feel present and be able to handle simple situations that I know weed is not helping with.. But I don't have a single clue how to just stop right now..
  I have a 6 month old puppy and live with my boyfriend, i want to feel more present for my little pup so I can give her the attention she deserves.. And I need to be sober to figure out if my relationship is falling apart or not..

I don't know how to quit smoking when it's just an obsessive habit without going to rehab.. I really don't want to go to a program, but I guess if that's my only option, I might just have to do it..
So I guess I'm posting today to ask for advice, or to hear your experiences in quitting a heavy addicting.

Thank you so much for reading this if youhave <3

They were trying to hide it from me since I  live in another country far away so can't easily visit them. After I learned this, things started to go downhill quickly as if the meds stopped working.  I feel that day by day my resistance is breaking, I find myself thinking that I should start smoking again, as if it is for my benefit, for my own good. There is the reasonable voice in my head saying that weed will only make things worse in this situation but it is getting weaker lately.

I've always had a really strong mind, but weed weakend me. 
I tried quitting a few times, with a maximum of 2 months.

This was last year October and I set myself a goal to quit January of this year definitely. 
I had some minor cravings in the beginning, but was doing relatively pretty good. To be really sure I even reached out to therapy after the first month. The guy was really impressed about how I ""just"" quit without having so many cravings.

In the end it was way easier than I expected, no cravings after a month, no insomnia (i slept better than ever) nothing negative. 

It's been almost 11 months now and I cannot imagine going back, smoking is never even an option anymore in my brain.

I started working out, eating healthier and in general was really reaching out my goals.
Until the time that it began to roll backwards, after awhile I stopped working out and also my eating habits are worsening you, now I feel tired again during the day. When i work out for a couple of weeks I feel really good, but somehow I cannot manage to go on with this, same with mediation and making use of my free time. My mood is not consistent and I feel like I cannot go onto the next level in my life journey.

I promised myself beginning this year, to quit smoking and become the best version lf myself in this universe. Become healthy, become fit, become emotionally strong. But i feel like I'm stagnating, the only thing I really did well was quitting, but it's been 11 months now.
I want to go on with my life, meet new people, go on new adventures, explore life.

The only thing that's guaranteed is that I will never touch a joint again, never in my life. That feeling is so strong in my mind I cannot even explain. Not for my one year anniversary, not on my birthday after 10 years, never again.

Is there anyone here with some advice for my situation?

I’m four months and some change into this quit attempt, after a 10 day binge that had severe withdrawal symptoms. I’m definitely proud of myself but I actually find it easy to get to four months once I stop. Then the PAWS hits. Last night I felt like I was back on week 2. Broke my sugar-free diet (vital for my mental health) and smoked several cigarettes. I feel scattered and it feels like I have this intense itch that nothing can scratch. Can’t focus on much and don’t have much motivation.

I’m really not sure if I’ll mentally come back from another relapse, and don’t ever want to experience the hell of acute withdrawal again. I see a therapist, attend 12 step meetings semi-regularly. I don’t see medication as a solution after trying many and realizing that I feel better off any mind altering substance. Some days are fantastic, and any day sober feels better than a day under the influence. But I feel very uncomfortable pretty often and know I’m at risk of relapsing again. I think it will likely take years to heal based on the severity of my addiction, and that the only way out of this cycle is to go through the discomfort.

i’ve smoked since i was 16 (i’m 22 now) and been an everyday smoker for the last 3-4 years. it feels crazy even thinking that it’s been that long. 

i started partially due to teen angst but largely due to the fact i am anxious and experience intrusive thoughts and have the tendency to overthink myself into despair, i’ve been incredibly introspective for my whole life growing up with an emotional unavailable mum. long story short, i live in my head a lot and weed helped me be able to quiet down that voice and actually fully unwind. 

the issues i had with weed before were mainly it making me lazy and meaning i didn’t have that much money in my pocket a lot of the time, which should be enough to make me quit anyway. but i wouldn’t be on this sub if i had that kind of willpower :)

more recently (pretty much since beginning of the year id say) it’s taking a big toll on my mental health. i often spiral into even deeper and more critical trains of thought, i become deeply introspective and consider every single one of my flaws and deepest fears and insecurities, i become nervous and panicky and uncomfortable. a lot of the times this is at night once i’ve smoked a few in a row and often these episodes feel like i’ll never snap out of it but i wake up forgetting them a lot of the time, until it’s back that night and i’m having the same thing again. a couple of times in the last few months i’ve found myself completely slumped unable to move similar to what i imagine a cracked out person is like, swimming around in my thoughts. a few times i’ve thrown up too. i smoke around 2.5-3 grams (6ish spliffs) a day.

i am tired of living this unhealthy cycle. i smoke way too much, can smoke a few spliffs for my wake and bake, will smoke consistently throughout the day as i can work (not to my best ability) high as i’ve been WFH for years, then smoke even more when my SO comes home from work. 

i am finding myself needing more to get me high, and i crave more all the time. it’s like i’ll be high but still wanna roll up. i’ll find myself knowing that if i smoke more my mind is likely to spiral and still..smoke more. the last few months have been like this and i REALLY need to get out. 

i am what you’d call high functioning, i have a good life, good job, good relationship. my addiction is going to ruin all of that, i know this and yet still some part of me can not put it down. my SO and i have always smoked together, but he’s made a few comments about how i smoke too much these days and i know it’s making him look at me differently. because i am different when under the influence, and i’m never not under the influence. 

i just want to hear from anyone that has been in a similar situation, knowing full well that they are harming themselves yet unable to pull away and hear some actual solid advice on how to do this!?

It was a trip. At first, I was pretty disappointed with myself. I accepted my failure, restarted my timer, and was ready to move on again. But all of a sudden, I was feeling so emotional. I saw a box of photos I've had under my bed for a few years that I had taken out on my dresser. Baby photos, family photos, good memories from high school and my days before I became a 'stoner.' I started bawling.   
I realized for the first time how much of life I was numbing out. How much pain I'd let myself collect over these years without dealing with it, preferring instead my comfortable haze. I've been lying to myself for 8 years, convincing myself that my green friend was helping me with depression, stresses of  life - it was my solace.   
Yesterday I realized how much I had missed out on over these years. I realized how much I had let partners in previous relationships walk over me and accepted people treating me badly, because I could just smoke it away after. Every opportunity I didn't reach for because I was convinced that I needed weed more than anything else. I've learned about myself and had great memories with weed, no one can contest that. But that time is long gone and I've been using it as a crutch instead. I cried for hours, and it felt like I finally let myself feel something fully for the first time in years. I needed the perspective change, it was cathartic af. 

I filled an envelope with my favorite photos from that box, of all the people that are important to me. I reminded myself that my life is beautiful and I need to do it justice by living it all - the good, bad and ugly. I wrote a letter to myself and sealed the envelope with photos and letter inside. I'm excited to open it in one year. If I get terrible craving before I reach one year, I'll open it before I decide to smoke, and sit with my photos and letter. I wrote a short list of ""my whys"" on the outside of the envelope - a friendly reminder of everything I have to gain by not smoking.   
I'm wishing you all strength to do this. I've never believed in myself more and I can't believe how much I let this plant rule my life for so long, convincing myself that I did not have a problem. I would go into work stoned, probably reeking of it, and would think that as long as I'm doing my stuff, this isn't an issue. I was so wrong.   


So freaking excited for the rest of my life.",27,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9896643757820129}"

When starting, get out of the place you regularly smoke, for me this was my bedroom. I've been to rehab before and fucking hated it, it's a miserable place. This time I took a holiday with some of my bros and even though the first couple of days really sucked the change of atmosphere and having shit to do every day helped immensely. By the 3rd day I barely had any cravings at all and kept myself constantly distracted from wanting to smoke.

Here's some hard truth, the first couple of months were actually really easy, because the high of not being high (irony) kept me going. It's when that all fades and you slowly return to normal that the real battle starts. I only started really getting cravings a couple of months into my sober state. There were a lot of temptations but what kept me going was taking every day as it comes. Don't set yourself a goal of being weed-free for a few weeks, months or years or whatever. Literally just tell yourself ""I will do my best to not smoke today"" and take it from there. When my cravings were at their worst I just kept reminding myself ""Okay, maybe I'll smoke tomorrow, but not today"" and nearly always when the next day rolled around my cravings would've completely subsided and I had no urge to smoke.

Okay so benefits. I have more money now than I've ever had in my life. I actually have a decent amount of savings tucked away and am on my way to putting my deposit down on my first house. I've dated more girls in the last year than I have in the last 10 because I always felt like I had to date girls who smoked, or I had this fear that once a girl found out I smoked she'd no longer be interested, that burden is completely gone, and it's a crazy freeing feeling. I'm so much more relaxed at work and am no longer counting down the minutes until I can smoke again. I've been able to go out with my mates (not much in the last few months thanks to Rona) and not have to worry about getting home to smoke at the end of the night. The theme to all this, is freedom. I no longer have an invisible ball and chain that I drag around that nobody sees but me. If I want to go somewhere and do something, I do it, without any worry about how I'm going to get blazed at the end of the night.

Will I relapse? Who knows? I'm taking it one day at a time.

It took me a while to get over the paranoia but once I did, I started smoking everyday. At first it was only in the evening justifying it because "" it helps me sleep"" then during the day because "" it relaxes me"" . Soon I started cutting myself from my friends, cancelling with them just because I would rather stay home smoking alone in my room. Once Covid arrived I was smoking from morning to evening, just staying in bed watching films i wouldn't even remember. I felt like a loser at my age being a stoner.

It is only when i found that sub that I realised I wasn't alone and I might not be a loser but just trapped. I read lots of posts and it gave me the strength to quit. 

So far it is the longest I have been without having cannabis. Quitting wasn't hard, apart from the weird vivid dreams I haven't felt any withdrawal symptoms. The harder though, is to find who I am without it. I haven't got any hobbies and I think I forgot what i liked doing before calling myself a stoner.

I feel like I wasted my youth away in a constant stoned daze. Started smoking it when I was 15 and I'm now 34. I'll never be able to get those years back and it's really fucking with my head to be honest. I feel so ashamed of myself. I'm absolutely fucking disgusted with myself.

I always told myself that weed was harmless, ""it just relaxes me bro"", you know the bullshit we all come out with. The irony is I once had a benzodiazepine habit and I found that easier to quit than weed. Here's comes the daunting realisation that weed is just as addictive and harmful as any other drug.

I think what has made weed so addictive to me is the fact that you lie to yourself and tell yourself it's not doing you any harm, when in reality you're an underachieving stoner. Without the weed addiction you'd have a better life by now and would have achieved much more in life. Facts.

The scaffolding is up, surrounding it, filled with workers hard at work. His sons are up there helping out as well. 

However, the budget is beginning to be far over-stretched and the money is running out far ahead of schedule. In addition to this, problems with the structure and foundations of the house are being uncovered one after the other. To make things worse, some of the work has been lazily done and is defective, so freshly built parts must be torn down and re-built. This puts even more stress on the building company, workers and the dwindling finances.

The man sits on his bed in his barely furnished room, his head in his hands as he tries to think of the solution. 

However, at that precise moment, an overlooked safety precaution (something to do with the footings of the scaffolding) causes the whole structure around the house, holding many workers and the man's sons, comes crashing down. They are all tragically and suddenly killed. 

---

If the man has been more PROACTIVE in his worries, he would have put pressure on the foreman to make sure no more mistakes were made, that the essential safety precautions were being observed, and he would have not had so much work done to his house if the budget was proving too thin. 

This is a huge failure that is not completely the man's fault, but he played his part in the tragedy through over thinking and worrying and not enough DOING. 

I know that weed mis-use is not as drastic as this story (paraphrased from The Power of Now i think), but the gist of it is the same. When i was smoking, i was sleepwalking into oblivion. No one was going to die, but my everything was slowly becoming less and less as it should be, or as I had pictured and dreamed my life being when i was a child. In fact, if i had kept on, people would die without me having ever truly shown them how much i loved and appreciated them. 

When i was smoking i was that man, sitting there in the centre of chaos, observing it from the outside, KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BUT DOING FUCK ALL!!

This post is a celebration of 4 weeks. I was starting to lose hope i would ever see this side of life again. I am finally becoming a real man. Incremental improvements are the way forward! Good luck to all of you, much love.

The first joint I smoked was paradise. For the first time, I never thought it was possible to influence my brain to act in certain ways.

I was seeing everything in a different light. The euphoria and bliss were incredible. It slowed time, kept me numb, made me happy, and allowed me to experience the world from the eye of a little child.

Ever since, I don't miss an opportunity to get that feeling again and again. Being a Nigerian, getting weed wasn't easy since it isn't legalized and can lead one to jail if caught.

But I took all the risks, and I was buying them in bags for storage. Covid came and I bought enough weed to last for three months. It was crazy!

In my mind, weed is very healthy and beneficial, compared to cigarettes and alcohol. The fact is, I became a preacher of weed. 

From smoking weekly, I started smoking every night. Gradually, it became a morning and night event. As if that wasn't enough, it became my breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Initially, I will smoke a half joint and I'll be too stoned to take another hit. This time around, two joints weren't even doing the trick anymore. Aside from that, it was affecting my finance, business, family, and friends.

I was slowly changing and I could sense it. Sometimes I talk to myself as if I'm a third person, as if there are two personalities inside of me. 

I began to develop some mental disorder that I never knew was there - Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Weed became my antidote to depression. Also, being high always seems to accelerate my sex drive, and I always end up wanking.

Smoking and wanking multiple times a day for a year changed me. I didn't need someone to tell me, as I could see it myself. I lost all my friends, because I didn't see a need for them anymore. When I'm high, nothing else matters.

I have been wanting to quit, but I keep giving myself lame excuses why I shouldn't, or promising myself to reduce how I take it.

Well, an addict is always an addict. I smoked all my weed last week and promised myself I'm never going to smoke for 30 days. 

This is my 2nd day without weed for more than a year. I am hungry, but I can't eat due to lack of appetite. If I take a bite of anything, I don't feel like taking more.

Last night, sleeping was hell for me. I just couldn't sleep. I tried everything possible and yet, I couldn't despite being 1am in the morning. I had to play some nature sounds on my mp3 before I finally drift off.

My appetite is yet to improve, but being off weed for two days now feels so good. I love how clear things around me feel all of a sudden. 

I always feel disgusted and ugly when I look in the mirror. But now, all I see is an incredibly handsome boy. Seems weed has been messing with my mind.

I thought I was more aware of the world when stoned, not knowing I was clouding my mind and sight with weed.

I don't know if I can beat this 30 days challenge, but I'm sure as hell going to try my best. I don't have anyone to talk to, as no one understands. I'm glad I found this sub, and hoping to make a few friends so we can help each other in this journey.

F/29 here, quitting weed after about 10 years of smoking 1-2 grams a day, about a half oz every two weeks, I never tried to quit before, had a few days off here and there.
So I quit smoking tobacco 180 days ago, then alcohol on the 1st of October (I 100% have a drink problem too) and continue not drinking, and now weed has followed too, as of midnight last night. 
  I am going to see this through for the long run, I have been trying to change my life for the past couple of years and keep getting nowhere, and it’s clear that weed is the main thing that’s holding me back.
I love the comfort bubble, how warm and safe it makes home feel, how easy it is to relax, how much better it’s makes my shitty job...  
But I realised that I need that comfort bubble to pop or won’t make any progress in life, it was fine when I was working bar jobs and I didn’t have to “be there” fully and didn’t give shit, but now I want goals and ambitions and passion in life and I don’t feel any of that right now.
  I’ve felt depressed for so long even though my life has changed really positively in the last 3 years, I’m still struggling with the same shit I was ten years ago, that I convinced myself weed was helping all this time, now I want to see life without it.
  I’m going to start counselling on the 2nd of November too, I know I have underlying trauma that will make it super easy for me to slip back to where I am if I do not deal with that as well.

So I’ve got some hard work to do, but hard work I should have done 5 years ago, I’m turning 30 in December, and I don’t want my thirties and the money I make to go down a black hole like my twenties did.
  It’s super doable for all of us with the right support, hope you guys are bobbing along just fine, shout me for support :)",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8696775436401367}"

I've gone through phases where I will smoke cigarettes for a couple of weeks and then quit and be fine. I know I can stop smoking, I clearly have the will power. With bud, it's just so much harder. I guess it's worth noting I mix my bud so I've been smoking tobacco but don't have any desire for a cigarette.

I've quit weed before for a while. I stuck to it until I faced some adversities and found my way back to old Mary Jane.

I don't know if this attempt is any different but all I know is I want to quit. I smoked all my bud last night - smoked joints instead of bongs (as of late because I threw my bong away in hopes of making it easier to quit the week before, lol) and I'd never smoke the whole thing, would put it out in the ashtray and off I went. I was craving so bad so I went through my ash tray and smoked the left overs. I feel hella gross so Ive just thrown everything related to smoking away and here I am on day one.

It's been real tough, but I'm starting to feel better and more hopeful already. I've been more motivated this week than for months and have been pretty productive considering. My anxiety has been at level 5000 but I largely attribute that to a combination of my partner leaving, withdrawals and dealing with some harsh realisations. I've been to see the Dr to get some melatonin tablets and a referral to the psychiatrist to deal with my underlying issurs - luckily Australia now has 20 free sessions due to covid messing with everyone's mental health.

I'm still lurking for sure, reading and interacting with posts when I can, but I've been so caught up in my daily life that it's no longer become a priority for me which I guess is a good thing. As the title says, today is day 299 clean for me. I quit on NYE 2019 and here I am, almost in the 11th month of sobriety from the sweet 'erb.

For those of you starting your sober journey, I can promise you it gets better. I couldn't give an exact time frame, but take each day as it comes. I would strongly recommend the following ""techniques"" to help aid you on your journey, but everyone's different and this is what worked for me:

**WATCH COMEDY FILMS/SHOWS/VIDEOS.** Seriously, they help a lot. Whatever you find funny, consume it. You may not laugh along, but subconsciously it helped lighten the mood massively and take the severity out of what I was going through.

**EXERCISE.** This one's so important. It hasn't got to be hours spent in the gym, but aim to get a sweat on regardless, whether it's going for a jog, doing some pushups, anything. The endorphins helps massively and begins to set your mind straight. It's also a great excuse for reflecting on where you're at with things in a positive manner.

**TRY SOMETHING NEW.** Take up something that's not part of your ""stoner"" routine, whether it's listening to a new podcast, buying a new book, watching a new series. Anything that's different from what you're used to, but nonetheless engaging. It's a great distraction and gives you something else to focus on.

Since quitting, I've accomplished so much. I've put on a nice few stone in the gym, gotten a new job, started (and almost finished) my driving lessons and saved up a considerable amount of money. All of those things wouldn't have happened had I have stayed hooked on the herb, fact. Some people can hustle whilst smoking, but I've had to accept that that's not me.

Even though I've been smoke free for so long, the fact still remains that this time last year, I was a stoner. 25th October 2019? I would've been stoned. So until I've hit the 1 year mark, every day left this year is still a day that I was stoned the year prior, and that still plays with my mind a little. I've been smelling weed so much more often these past few weeks, and instead of being put off by it, it really brings the memories flooding back each time and smells so damn tempting.

I'm really hoping to keep up this momentum, I have been trying to get to this stage for so long, so any tips or words of encouragement would be great.

I usually tend to relapse due to my anxiety and inability to regulate my emotions well due to a mental illness I suffer from. So I exercised three times yesterday which I feel definitely made a big difference so I will definitely keep that up as much as possible!

The only withdrawal I'm really feeling hard (apart from dealing with anxiety and depressive mood swings) is not having an appetite. I struggled to get scrambled eggs on toast down around lunch time yesterday and I ate some bread chips and dip before dinner, which I ended up feeling really nauseated and threw it all up 🤢 I didn't eat dinner and went to bed early.

I started with meditation before I wanted to quit. But i knew how much of a help it was so it made quitting that much easier. It takes daily practice I do it every morning and night and often during the day once as well. In the morning and night I use wim hof breathing and then do 5-15 minutes of meditation after and during the day it’s just 5-15 minutes. Now I use the balance app so one thing I used a lot was the breaking habits single meditation practice. It’s free for one year (this isn’t a promotion) but after that’s it’s 70 dollars so i guess if you want get the free trial than record the sessions with another device or something idk but I was definitely a help. It still required tons of will power to quit but the meditation helped me to find ways to acquire that power through breathing and just being mindful and aware. I got urges like first thing in the morning so that’s why I started first thing in the morning I would meditate those urges away. Same for at night as that was when I would use. And during the day it’s just extra practice to really help me be able to stop, breathe, and clear my mind. It’s a practice that won’t only help you with this but in general everything will get better. More energy, less stress, a better mood overall, better appetite, and a clear mind. Foggy mind sucks when you quit. Use meditation to help clear it. It’s a HUGE help and you will learn self power and self love. I strongly urge everyone to meditate.

I have had problems with addiction since I was a teenager. Weed has been the most difficult drug for me to manage. I've come to the conclusion that all it does for me is to make me feel numb. If I want to experience the  world in its fullness I  should lose this stupid comfort blanket. 

I am doing a chemistry degree and my research requires me to be focused and motivated. Smoking hash is an absolute spanner in the works. I fear that I'll never achieve my full potential. I need support, I should probably talk to the uni or something but I am scared. If it was a different mental health condition I wouldn't be so ashamed. But because it is addiction I am worried they'll think in the back of their minds that its my fault and I should just have more self control.

I haven't smoked today and I don't intend to but I don't trust myself any more. I wanted to write this post because I feel as though I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't want to tell my family or gf because I dont want to worry them. They've been through enough. My housemates all seem to be getting on with life and all look so happy. I feel like I have to carry this massive weight with me everywhere I go. I'm jealous of them. I feel like I'm a burden on them also. The one with problems who can't manage their own emotions without drugs. I do hate myself a lot of the time. I sometimes put up a front of confidence / cockiness to hide my insecurities. I feel so lonely. 

My girlfriend was going to come to visit but we had to cancel because my housemates were showing symptons. I feel low and I can't think straight. I am trapped indoors. I almost certainly have covid.

So I'm almost at 2 months now, and I'm still having some issues. Anxiety is still with me daily, some days it's tolerable and some days it's not. With the anxiety also comes eyesight and auditory issues too. I still can't focus on much, faces get blurry sometimes, and voices can sound distant at times. I'm having a major hard time focusing. 

I can't tell if this is still withdrawal or anxiety. I don't really know what to do but I literally do not have much of a quality of life anymore. 5 months ago, I was happy, exercising daily, in really good shape, I was a high functioning pothead. And now I can't even relax enough to do anything I loved before. 

Any advice for me? It is very very very slowly getting easier, but I can't live like this. I see a therapist every week, I'm going for EMDR treatment next week for PTSD, I don't know what the hell else to do. I don't want medication cause I'm terrified to be on something like that.

I miss that feeling of euphoria, that sense of complete calm where every muscle in my body relaxes,  no worries exist, and I don’t even care or know what year it is. I felt a sense of eternal bliss. I don’t know if I’ve ever felt anything like it sober. I don’t know if I ever will. 

That feeling for me is like an ocean of euphoria. That feeling is my escape from all the horrible things that make life so hard. Personally, I experience racism, homophobia, job stress, economic stress, and I’m healing from the trauma I’ve lived. The problem is that that feeling is an ocean that I’ll drown in because I don’t know how to swim in there. That feeling is an ocean I get brought to with magic, but I don’t have the ability to swim back to shore. And worst, it’s an ocean that doesn’t tell me when I’m drowning, because the water in my lungs would make me feel happy. 

Right now I’m thinking of something from Sailor Moon of all places. In an episode, an evil sorceress almost kills Sailor Moon by trapping her in a beautiful field of dreams. Flowers tell her to stay safe and not fight the good fight or rescue her loved ones because it’s scary. Her friend can’t get through to her. And the evil sorceress explains to Sailor Jupiter, who came to rescue Sailor Moon, that this isn’t a typical nightmare because you want to wake up from a nightmare. This is a beautiful dream she’ll never wake up from because she’s so happy. It takes seeing and touching a fallen earring as Sailor Jupiter loses and nearly dies, to send a shock to her system and trigger all of her memories of what matters to her to get her to snap out of it.

What I see from here is that that ocean of bliss is exactly like that dream. Luckily I too have memories and loved ones that make me want to snap out of this dream. But it’s still hard. I could easily want to go into that ocean, and explore other oceans of euphoria. I’m not saying that drowning is inevitable; after all, physical overdose on cannabis is extraordinarily rare. Though I have nearly drowned in the feeling I get from alcohol, too. A friend stopped me from drowning in this ocean with prescription painkillers after I was in a motorcycle crash. Even with other drugs like opiates, amphetamines, and alcohol, plenty of people use them and then stop before ever getting to a place of getting lost in the sea. What I’m saying is that I don’t want to expend the energy of building a life boat to get home from a sea that’s an illusion anyways. Visiting that beautiful place in my mind got me through some really tough times, and I got to feel something I’d never felt in my life before: bliss. My view may change, it’s only day 41. But I continue to survive things and heal without it, and I remember now that I am strong enough to withstand this world without self-medicating.

I wasn't able to enjoy weed the way I wanted to *without* having a huge tolerance. 

First time I relapsed, I barely count it, since I took a puff off a joint and I was drunk, and it was before bed. I went to sleep that night feeling extremely euphoric. But, i could have gone without it. I felt foggy in the morning. Second relapse, I smoked with my friend. I took a medium bong bowl. Mistake. I got so high, that I couldn't focus on anything. We were playing amnesia:  a machine for pigs, and I had to ask him to play for me as I couldn't figure anything out. I realised, I couldn't even watch my friend play the game. I couldn't immerse myself in the story. I was just feeling anxious and confused.

I kept feeling like I was being annoying to him, talking too much and letting my social anxiety control me. This guy has been my friend for like almost a decade now, I shouldn't be feeling this way around him. Yet weed reduced me to an social toddler. I truly didn't enjoy it. 

It doesn't help me relax anymore. It just makes me zone out. 

At this point I'm on my 5th day since that night. I have BARELY been thinking about smoking, usually if I do get an urge it's really late at night when I'm feeling slightly depressed from being socially burnt out. I'm an introvert, and for so long I relied on weed to have time to myself and recharge. I'm still stuck in a dopamine seeking mindset at night-- watching YouTube videos for an hour too long, going to bed late. 

But at least now, when I get 6 hours of sleep, I actually feel rested. Before, I'd always have 7.5 hours of sleep, but marijuana messed with my REM sleep. So it didn't feel like 7.5. I believe my discipline is slowly starting to get better, I'm not really that mad at myself for staying up too late. I know it's something I need to work on, but no reason to berate myself over it.

I'm looking forward to when I just don't get cravings. It's easy to overcome them now, I can't imagine how easy it'll be in another couple weeks. Every time I consider smoking, I recognise the part of my brain that sounds like ""Fuck it, just do it"", and I overcome it. It's such a small impulse, yet so deeply engrained. It used to be.. Get up, smoke. Go to work. Get home from work, smoke. Cook. Smoke. Eat. Smoke. Play video games. Smoke. Play video games. Smoke. Sleep.

Now, I feel way more ""there"" when I'm playing games. I'm spending WAY more time talking to my friends and I'm paying more attention to my social levels. I'm learning to take time to myself and still getting used to self soothing without weed. 

That's my rant/thoughts. If you're still reading, maybe you relate. Here's what I've been doing for self soothing/calming me down

- low effort snacks, like crackers  
- Hot showers  
- working out (pull ups and push ups, that's all really)
- Music  
- Youtube  
- reading  
- writing down my thoughts in notes  
- drinking alcohol with friends (keeping this to a minimum of twice a week, i know it's a slippery slope)  
-  calm voice chats (usually late at night if I feel anxious, ill hop on voice chat and watch my friends play video games and stay mostly quiet. it helps me calm down without using too much social energy)

I was wondering if anyone had other good self soothing rituals that I may be missing out on. I know I should honestly be going for more walks, but i still find it hard to gather the motivation to do it.

I also broke up with my fiance and partner of almost 10 years... it's really important to me that I don't fall back into this habit as I feel like it's ruined my life for the past 8 years and unfortunately my fiance was worse than me and kind of a big part of the problem. I'd be crying every night, stoned of course, saying I can't do this anymore, please can we stop... he'd say yes, and then wake up the next day and roll a doobie first thing and that was it. My anxiety was through the roof and I'm not generally an anxious person. We were both working at home so it was an all day, every day kind of thing. I had to go away on vacation by myself just to get sober and think clearly. 

Anyways, for the most part I'm feeling pretty good. My withdrawal symptoms weren't quite as bad as they've been before. The night sweats are gone and the crazy crying is gone and I can sleep most nights alright now. What I'm struggling with is my ability to function... I work for myself and I can't seem to concentrate on working at all, like there's just a big NOPE anytime I sit down to do something so I procrastinate by doing busy things like taking out the garbage or making food or tidying the house or scrolling through Reddit of course. I'm working out 4 times a week and feeling really good in the gym, my lifts are all improving, and I walk my dog twice a day and eat healthy for the most part... so I'm ""doing"" the right things and it helps my moods a bit but I still just feel hopeless and can't get anything done. I'm trying to be easy on myself, but I really need to work so I can make money now that I'm on my own and I just.... can't? It stresses me out because I see my bank account dwindling and I'm just sitting here not doing much about it. When I smoked I could get really into what I was doing (i'm a designer) and work for 12+ hours a day... it wasn't healthy and I would burn myself out but at least I made progress. Now I don't know what to do because I can't focus and my motivation is shot but I really don't want to smoke again. 

I reluctantly made a doctor's appointment for next week so I can get a referral to a therapist but I don't even know if my insurance will cover that. I know that I've had a lot of symptoms of depression over the years which I usually masked with the weed.

My fiancée (5 years together, a lot of it long distance) who is from the US moved to the UK to marry me this year. When covid happened our wedding was cancelled and because of the conditions of the visa, she was not able to work and lockdown prevented her from meeting new people. Her mental health deteriorated badly and because of my weed habit I got into this bunker mentality of ""lets just stay in and let this all blow over"". That was the right thing to do but it shouldn't have stopped up taking long drives or walks to places. It's fine when you like to smoke all day but the situation was driving her crazy. She had a breakdown and decided she couldn't marry me right now.

We didn't break up but she has gone back to the US to seek treatment as she has now been diagnosed bipolar. Of course, this is massive and explains a lot about what went wrong. It explains why she couldn't cope with the difficult, but not terrible situation we were in. She also did the exact right thing by not marrying me when she was in a bipolar depression. 

She said what she needs to see from me is to get my weed under control so that I can live a less isolated life. I have already had two therapy sessions and although my therapist said this might not be the right time to stop, I know in my heart it is.

I have two paths laid out in front of me. One is a long and painful road back to being with my fiancée, the other is going it alone once again when I thought I had found my forever partner. For either of those paths weed has got to go. I packed my considerable stash and equipment into a box this morning and will look to offload it to friends as soon as possible.

I also need to make sure I am doing this for me, and not to save a relationship. This relationship may be doomed anyway and I don't want to go back to my old ways if it doesn't work out.",1,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9934868812561035}"

The past 5 years I now see that I’ve been using as a means to cover up and hide from pain. I try to hide from emotions and any drama by simply tuning it out by getting and staying high at all times. I never come down. I’m always at a peak, when the peak starts going away I smoke again. Even when I’m not smoking - which is only when a I work.. I’m still high the entire 8 hours because I smoke so consistently. I am never sober and it actually makes me nervous about getting sober. I forgot how it feels. I don’t remember that last time I felt sober. 

Well.. a few years ago I was able to quit for 3 months and that’s the longest I ever went. It was really amazing at that time because I was able to quit weed, cigarettes, and caffeine at the same time! I got mad headaches and horrible panic attacks but I made it through. My fatal mistake was that I didn’t toss out what I had left from 3 months ago. I thought I could just take a puff or two since I’m bored, I’m good right? Wrong. 3 months wasted. Everything is linked together. Once I started smoking weed again I started smoking cigarettes. And since I was smoking again before I’d sleep I’d need a high dose of caffeine every morning. Back to square one. 

I’ve tried a couple other times after that. One lasted a month and a half, the other just 3 weeks. What happens is I start feeling bored and like I’m strong enough to compromise a bit without falling. But with me I guess there’s only one way I know how to smoke... and that’s excessively. 

I really need this this time I feel good about it. Mainly because I’m not having to fight myself internally to convince myself to quit. My body and mind are finally on the same page. I want this. I know it may suck bad. But the truth is I’m already in a world of misery and repetition every day. I get bad panic attacks sometime when I hit weed really hard, I get headaches already, I’m tired and fatigue.. I’m already feeling the known withdrawal feelings even when I smoke. So nothing to lose really. Besides all that - I just feel like it’s a matter of mental health now. I don’t want to end up in a substance abuse induced psychosis. I’ve had some really really bad panic attacks while smoking weed and drinking high doses of caffeine at the same time.. where I don’t feel like me. It starts as me getting light headed, then turns to me feeling like I’m going to black out. I sit and try to breath it away but it only gets worse. My mind suddenly loses its grasp of who I am and why it’s attached to me. I don’t understand what I’m doing or why I’m doing it. I feel like I’m having to hold on to my sanity in order not to lose it. Sheer terror is what I feel. I’m going to die. Or worse, I’m actually losing my mind this time. It was scary.

22 years old. 11 days sober. 

my history:  
15 - 17 = 0.5 grams a month  
17 - 19 = 1 gram a week  
19 - 20 = 2 grams a week  
21 - 22 = 1 gram a day (since COVID started)

I ran out 11 days ago and didn't call my dealer. So glad I'm sober now, don't think I'll ever smoke again. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Realizations:

1) THE FIRST DAY ISN'T THE WORST!  
the first day is fine. The second day is bad. Days 3-5 are the worst. If I could do it again, I would have made my last smoking day Thursday instead of Tuesday, so the worst of the withdrawals would be over the weekend. Perhaps I would have even saved a little bit of weed, so I could taper down, rather than go full cold turkey.   
2) I get extremely ANGRY during days 3-6!  
Cussed out my roommate because he asked me politely to wash my portion of the dishes.  
   
Flipped out at my manager on the first Friday during a zoom call when he was politely giving me pointers to do my job better - it was extremely out of character for me and he was shocked to say the least.  (Fortunately nothing bad happened, in fact he even publicly complimented my work on Monday LOL - perhaps he thought I was angry because I didn't get enough recognition)

3) weed slows me down. 

I grew up poor and I want to be rich. I work about 80 hours a week on my dayjob and side hustle and was stoned 24/7 since COVID to keep me going after my 9-5 (extra stress, broke up with ex gf, uncertainty etc). Since I quit, my efficiency has improved about x3 since I quit, I no longer need to work those long hours (but I choose to, because my progress is WAY faster now!)

4) weed gives me false comfort. I couldn't believe how filthy my house was - it was constantly stressing me out and I just reached for the bong to relax. When I was stoned, things were fine and I could work/relax no problem, cleaning up felt like a chore because nothing looked out of place. Now cleaning up is much easier, I feel DISGUSTED at my environment for being so dirty and cleaning up feels THERAPEUTIC. 

5) People like me more

My brain is much sharper so I'm much better at cracking jokes now.

I developed social anxiety from being stoned all the time, I just couldn't keep up with social conversation and people probably looked at me weird because I responded too slowly or weirdly. 

6) I'm making more money. 

I hired a Filipino Virtual assistant to help with my internet business. I used to try and handle everything alone.

After my first week, I spent $120 on her salary - I've already made back $300 and saved 20 hours of time!!!",17,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9952110648155212}"

From having strict parents I loved sneaking around and getting high as a teenager. I felt so euphoric and free. As I got older more people had weed and I smoked more. Then ended up buying my own. Then started smoking without friends. I became a daily stoner. Wake and bake before college classes. Smoke before work. You name it. I loved escaping the real world and being high. Edibles, vape, flower, anything with THC. 

Until 2020...

When CV19 hit, people were staying home and I became WFH. All the more easy to get baked all day. No one at my job could see me. I ended up not even feeling high anymore because I smoked, vaped and ate as much weed as I could. I was spending a shit load of money. 

Throughout this year I have had a variety of panic attacks. They used to happen seldomly in the past. But this year with me being high and all the other crap going on they became frequent. For those of you who have never experienced them, they are AWFUL. 

Imagine feeling like your throat is swollen shut, you can't breathe, and your arms are numb like you are having a stroke. You are in the mindset of thinking you are going to DIE. It is like having a monster living inside your own body. They come randomly. 

I saw a healer that I know. I had to quit smoking weed. It was getting me too into my head. Along with caffeine, alcohol, and animal based foods. All I used to consume where those things. 

2 months in with no THC and I feel so much better. It used to rule my life. I tried quitting several times. But always had an excuse to start back up. Although my anxiety made me absolutely miserable. I think that it was a blessing in a weird way. I probably would've never quit weed without it. I am now scared to get high in fear of the old headspace I was stuck in. 

Just know, that the first 24 hours are always the hardest. You will have trouble sleeping, you will get nightmares, but eventually they go away. You start to become a regular functioning human again.

I have no more tomorrow’s to give, no more moderation attempts and “only smoking with my friends”.

Thoughts from 3 days in,"First time posting on reddit.. it's funny how we can be so vulnerable online when I can't utter a word of this to anyone I know, leaves have been a great motivator no doubt.

It's been 3 years of heavy use... Waking baking and constantly high for everything... Taking tolerance breaks every now and then. 

In that time, my life has not moved a single inch forward.

To be fair I had a great start, good degree, good job, great friends until I was 24. Following the trill with exciting but ultimately people that are bad for me.


The past 3 years have been numb, dumb and fun but at this point smoking 20 joints a day , doing nothing really puts a strain on your relationships and your self esteem... My friends pity me, and I seem to drain them of energy.

I feel so empty/vacant and it really does feel like a dementor circling around me..


I quit 2 month ago for a month through so much pain, of insomnia for a week, depression and anxiety fully on the table but relapsed as soon as my roommate offered some when I got back from my parents house. 


Trying again this time and feels like groundhog days of pain.. am I cursed to repeat this for eternity? Excersicing helps, eating a little bit helps too in the first couple of days. Being surrounded by people who unconditionally love you helps too


My fear is that I've broken myself from abusing this so hard, and will it ever be the same again?


Thank you for reading this rambly post and I hope all here finds balance.

At the end there, I would burn through about an ounce every two weeks, never ever thinking weed could actually hurt me. Even though for the last two years I’ve been waking up nauseous and unable to eat until 2 in the afternoon. Even despite the total lack of appetite and weight loss, I never suspected the weed was killing me. Then one day it all hit me like a ton of bricks. I started puking uncontrollably. I couldn’t eat anything, I couldn’t even smell anything without dry heaving. Not even water would stay down. I’d throw up every 5 minutes like clockwork and that was actually the best part. For a second or two after each puking session I would feel almost normal. But it always came back. 

This continued for two and a half weeks. About 18 days of constant nausea. It was horrible. Easily the worst thing I’ve ever been through. My parents thought I was withdrawing from opiates but the ER tested me thankfully and it proved to them I wasn’t on anything besides the weed. Oh also, I had to go to the emergency room 5 separate times to receive IV fluids because I was physically incapable of keeping any water in my stomach. I didn’t eat during this whole time too. Before I weighed 160 at 6’0”. At the end of it all, I weighed 128 pounds with light clothing. I still feel weak even after returning to normal eating for the last 10 days. I feel traumatized from the whole event. I never thought weed would have any negative effects but sure enough, it’s a drug like all the rest. Before this happened I would have never believed this was even possible but here I am now sober and terrified of even smelling it and getting particles in my brain. 

What sucks though is I was planning my life around chilling out and smoking. My retirement plan was to build a ranch and get some animals just to wake up every day, smoke, do my chores, and sit on my porch and hang out. Now I’m getting used to being sober for the first real time since I was 16. I have zero desire to ever smoke again but I’m finding it hard to do all the things I used to enjoy because I always used to do them high. What’s worse is all of my close friends still regularly use and I’ve had a very hard time keeping close relationships with people so I don’t wanna just burn bridges over this. I’m excited to be sober and clear headed for a while but I feel kind of alone in this because it wasn’t really my choice to quit when I did. I wanted to, I was planning on it at some point, for a while, but it happened so suddenly and partnered with such a horrible way to withdrawal it left me feeling ungrounded and in uncharted waters.

My SO and I are in marriage counselling and the counselor wants him to stop smoking, kind of a last ditch effort to save the marriage.  But I don't think there is anything we can say to get through to him. He's so stoned that he doesn't even know why we are going to counseling... he forgets every time I tell him our marriage is ending. I'm willing to try having the conversation, but I know there is only one chance to get through. The Doc wants to take the route that he has so much potential and creativity that is going to waste. I don't know if that will be powerful enough. But if I lay out the reality of our marriage and all the times he has broken my heart and forgotten about it, I think he will just shut down.

One of the reasons I know I wanted to quit was because I was starting to get anxiety attacks while high and it was scaring me a lot. So quitting had some fear motivation. On top of all the other reasons of course - it was ruining my life. 

Today I had a good day, saw some friends, had a few beers and found myself thinking about my old friend again - weed. My addict brain started to rationalize the thought of maybe going and getting a joint because it wasn’t a negative trigger or me trying to escape. I was feeling pretty good and I’d been doing so well and it almost felt like I wanted to celebrate my sobriety with smoking (!!). Which makes no sense when you think about it! The urge to smoke was strong because I had forgotten about the fear that carried me through the first few days and felt this false sense of confidence. 

I was driving around dispensaries and reaalllyyy  battling in my head. I decided to call my brother and tell him how I was feeling. He helped me remember why I quit and that I am NOT out of the woods by any means. He told me how I’ve seem so much better and more myself since I’ve quit. After our conversation I felt like I snapped out of it and got past the intense craving moment. 

It seems like a small thing but I am SO proud that I got through this. Moral of the story, don’t be afraid to call someone when you’re feeling weak.

I've been an everyday smoker for around seven years now, and even though i never smoked before work it would always be on my mind and i found myself organising my life around when i would be able to get high.

Music is my passion and I've played guitar for the majority of my life, so I've always written off my addiction as just being part of the musician lifestyle. 
We always find a way to justify it. 
Things changed when we went into isolation this year, I'm from a city in Australia that's just coming out of one of the harshest lockdowns in the world, and like most stoners, at first i loved the fact that i could smoke all day with basically no consequences. 
How wrong i was. 

Without any kind of balance in my life i started spiralling into depression. I stopped talking to my friends, stopped playing guitar and was just kinda drifting through the days whilst this huge knot of sadness and anxiety built up in my chest. 
Finally i got to the point where i knew i had to do something, and thinking that weed was the root of all my problems i stopped smoking about three months ago now. 
Thing is, my depression didn't stop after that. 
I hadn't replaced this huge part of my life with anything, so i felt completely lost and useless. 
I'd forgotten who i was before the weed, and finally acknowledging this as the deeper problem i needed to fix, i started making changes to my lifestyle. 
I'm now exercising every day, seeing a therapist, learning a new language, getting back in contact with people I'd thought had forgotten about me and looking forward to the future for the first time in a long time. 

I guess the message I'm trying to get across with this post is that quitting is only half the battle, you have to replace the habit with something meaningful and rewarding or else you're just gonna feel like you've lost a piece of yourself.

One of the managers is a right cunt, and the job itself is extremely stressful. It’s also very hot. I have chronic migraines that are triggered by stress and heat, so every day after work, I have a terrible migraine. Weed helps on that front. It almost numbs the throbbing pain and it helps take the aura away. And like everyone else, it helps me deal with stress. I have a crazy short attention span and it makes it hard for me to eat because I get so distracted by everything I need to do that I forget to eat. Today for example, I have had 6 milk duds and a green apple. That is all. And I only ate the apple because my fiancé reminded me to eat. Most days my lack of eating gets so bad that I end up getting nauseous and throw up, which makes me not want to eat even more. It all sounds like it’d be beneficial to smoke, except I have an addictive personality and severe ptsd, and once I start smoking, I’ll smoke small amounts every 2 hours. I feel like I have to keep the high going. I go through a gram every 4-5 days, that’s how little I smoke. It  gets to a point where I feel like I don’t want to do anything unless I’m high, I don’t want to get out of bed unless I know there’s a bowl waiting for me. I’ve gone a month without smoking before, and it was going great until my abusive mom showed up at my house unannounced after us not speaking to each other for 6 months. That was a trigger. Now I’m dealing with so much stress that I feel like I need weed to cope with it all. I’m trying really hard to focus on mentally engaging activities but the cravings are gnawing away at me. In the back of my mind I’m finding reasons why I need it. Valid and good reasons. I don’t know what to do.

He was a daily smoker for the better part of 20 years. 
He’s doing so well and I’m extremely proud of his decision to end his relationship with chemical dependency. He’s 8 years off of alcohol. He’s happier today and has a really strong outlook. I think he’s going to have long - term success this time. 

I’ve read a lot of posts on here about high blood pressure after quitting. He quit abruptly and didn’t really taper. He’s been on high blood pressure medicine for years. The last few days his blood pressure has been insanely high. I made him go to the ER yesterday morning and the doctor wasn’t overly concerned. They increased his previous prescription and he now takes double what he was. It’s not helping though. He just took his blood pressure and it was 176/102. When he went to the ER it was 180/115. I’m curious if this is how his blood pressure will remain forever, or if this is temporary? The studies I’ve read online leave much to be desired. I feel like I’ve scoured the internet for answers and came up dry, so now I’m looking to folks with first-hand experience. 

From what I’ve found online , in summary: smoking daily can lower blood pressure, but long - term it is causing more cardiovascular harm. Damaging blood vessels etc. he also has a kidney that doesn’t function at full capacity and that is most likely the root cause of his hypertension. My question to myself is, is this how high his blood pressure would normally be without marijuana, or is this due to withdrawal? Of course the doctors don’t know much about this and Were not helpful at all. 

Did you have an increase in blood pressure when quitting nicotine or marijuana and if so, did it return to normal eventually. He’s only 38  years old and I’m really concerned since his is so high.

Another problem is that since I’ve smoked my anxiety is significantly better, giving me reason to continue smoking... I know it’s not the case and that ultimately the weed will exacerbate my anxiety, so it’s a confusing sensation.

So I left smoking weed in last december (went from 14g/week to 0).  I went cold turkey and stoped until quarantine.  I restarted smoking frequently during the isolation.  Now I'm a social/party smoker I have to admit but it's still less than twice per month so I consider I'm not a smoker anymore.  I have a tip for everyone of yall.  When I stopped smoking smokes and weed, I was stuggling sometime with anxiety so my brain was saying ""dude you need that quick puff it would feel sooo good""... So I had to create a tactic to counter that.  I decided I'd make a small locked stash in wich I'd have a joint, my pipe, .5g if weed and 1 cigarette for an extreme situation.  So everytime I need that puff and I want to got smoke, it takes me at least 3 min to find the key, unlock it, take it out and smoke.  In that time generally the urge goes away but I also have the time to think to myself wait, you don't want to buy more cuz it will be easier to retake some knoing you have some spear, but also that amount, you want to keep it for maybe a more urgent situation, I might need it even more later.  So for the past 6 months I've been holding on to that stash keeping me away to fall again in the deep pit of adiction.

At first, weed really helped me lose weight and helped me with mental health issues which is why I got hooked so quickly. But eventually it led to me not being able to eat at all until I could get high after work. Cut to now, three years later, and I am still dealing with severe disordered eating. I can’t eat if I am not high. The most I can get down is a few pieces of fruit throughout the day (half an orange or banana). This is the only thing that is stopping me from being successful in quitting. I’ve dealt with my other issues that pushed me into needing weed everyday, but if I don’t smoke I don’t eat. Considering my history with an eating disorder, the fear of going into a place of completely starving myself again is a lot scarier than giving up and smoking again.

I totally have ADHD, and being stoned 24/7 was certainly not a good thing to combine that with. I'm a full time university student and I get assigned SO MUCH reading. I have two textbooks I'm supposed to read a chapter, sometimes two, out of per week, and there's also a novel I'm supposed to read for a class and then write a paper on it. I'm also in a programming class, and there is assigned reading, but coding is the main focus and the textbook material never comes up - I've never opened the thing, never opened the book last quarter either and was fine.

BUT, it's still a LOT of reading, I ballpark the amount of reading I'm supposed to be doing per day at 3hrs, and I don't get how I'm supposed to accomplish that. I'm also a super slow reader because of attention problems.

To explain a little, I'll just be reading, come across a certain sentence or whatever, it reminds me of something else that's floating around in my brain, and BAM, I'm suddenly daydreaming while staring at a book. And this can last up to a few minutes per instance, and that's why it can take me over even 10 minutes to read a single page. It does vary a bit tho, depending on how interesting what I'm reading is.

(long post),"Hi everyone, I finally, finally, FINALLY hit day 10 after 7383837377384 attempts to quit. I’m very proud of myself! This is something I seriously never thought I could accomplish, but here I am. 

I wanted to share my experience to let people like me in the early stages know that sobriety IS possible and things DO get better, sometimes earlier than you think it will. I hear a lot of horror stories on this sub which are all valid/true, but also not everyone’s subjective truth. 

I was a daily multiple times a day smoker for 10 years. I would smoke 2g flower everyday and when I moved to vaping, it would be 1g every two days. I would literally panic when I was running out, and I was a frequent flyer to my dealers and later to the dispensary. I really never imagined I’d be off the shit, now I’m confident I’m never going back. Ever. 

In the past 10 days, my life has improved considerably. I am much more productive in every aspect of my life. My house is cleaner, my cat is happier, my hobbies are flourishing, my creativity is surging, my social anxiety has gone down (for once in my life I’m actually messaging people first, besides my dealer lol), my ADHD has become more manageable, I’ve changed my eating habits and in general, I am very happy now! 

Which is not to say I didn’t struggle, or that I’m out of the woods yet. The first 4 days were awful. Cravings, depression, sweating, digestion problems, etc. But I kept going. I let myself wallow for those first 4 days, but by day 5, I verbally told myself to get up and do something and honestly haven’t looked back since. It was very much like a break up with a very toxic person who made me feel like everyday was just the same rerun of a boring show. 

But now, everyday is new. I enjoy the small things. I don’t take these moments for granted anymore. Of course I have troubles, and I still get a super small craving maybe once a day, but it’s so manageable, it’s a joke. I’m able to feel the world and my emotions and it’s amazing. I’m dreaming again and honestly I look forward to going to sleep every night just to experience these weird ass visions. 

So what I really wanted to say was that if you’re in your early days or considering quitting, keep with it/do it. IT GETS BETTER. There’s so many benefits that you don’t even realize are there. There are many people who go through withdrawal much harder than me and have been sober much longer than me, and to those people I give the biggest props, but subjectively for me, I am so happy at 10 days. I’m so happy I did this! You have to take into account, those of us in the early days, that you may be one of those people who can make it out fairly easy, as long as you stick to your guns. Even if it’s difficult for you, even if you’re much further in your journey than me, I truly believe things will get better! JUST KEEP GOING! Eventually the fog will lift and it’ll just be you standing there. Make the most of it. Everything’s going to happen for you. 

Thank you, leaves, I couldn’t have gotten this far without you. Best wishes everyone!",204,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.997686505317688}"

I really dont want to be like this anymore and I've tried over last month to quit and done 3 or 4 days here and there. No more!!!! I dont want it. I feel like everyone else when they say once they have smoked since having few days off you feel like crap. But yet I keep going back it's such a vicious cycle.

I can brake the cycle and I'm excited to feel how all the long term quitters feel like and describe their new chapters.

I am a late bloomer to weed having started when I was 33.  For many years,  I felt that it was a miracle.  I am quite shy and bashful and it affected my work performance and my desire to meet a romantic partner.  I began to smoke more frequently at work in order to focus and feel confident before a important client meeting or before a date.   I began to progress really well in my career, all while going to work buzzed.  The weed untied my tongue and helped me get promoted and even to date around and finally find a fiance. Unfortunately, before I got married, I caught her cheating and ended it which was a devasting event in my life that I am still struggling to accept and overcome Smoking weed  helped me through during the initial time after that experience and helped me to start dating again.   

But things changed about 18 months ago.   For whatever reason,  the weed became less and less effective so I choose to quit completely   I gave it about 6 months and those 6 months were truly horrible.   I became very depressed and anxious all the time.   I got into therapy and on antidepressants but nothing helped.   Fast forward,  i've been in a terrible battle for the last year or so. In the periods that I abstain from weed, I lose all motivation and ambition.  It reached a crisis level in June 2020 when I could no longer do my work and I quit my job and really damaged my career prospects.  I have been saving most of my income for the past 20 years in order to someday start a family but I've started to give up hope of meeting someone or becoming a father.  (FYI, saying/writing that out loud is really painful right now.)
Anyway, I could technically survive on those saving for several years if I choose to.  I do think about suicide often but have no plans to act on it.  My parents are still alive and it would destroy them.  Once they are gone though,  I worry that I might just give up completely on living.    

Getting back to weed,  right now I hate to admit that it's the only thing that gets me moving.  Most days I fight the urge to smoke but,  I end up hardly leaving my house and I get nothing accomplished.   But on days that I choose to smoke,  I feel better, more confident and I can go out. For me, it takes one small puff from a vape pen to go with my morning coffee.  I can then exercise, go meet friends or explore new career and business opportunities.  I'm extremely reliant on its effects, of which I am ashamed.

The weed has some nasty side effects that I am struggling with.   For the first 45 minutes after I smoke, there are a rush of emotions and I end up an embarrassing crying mess.  Eventually, I'm able to think my way out of that downward spiral of awful thoughts, compose myself and  get started on my day.  

I don't know what I should do anymore.  I try not to smoke most days because I hate that 45 minutes of hell.  On the other hand, during the weed free days, my mood is so low and despondent that I am unable to even brush my teeth or go for a walk.  

I still meet with a shrink weekly and have explained all this to him.  He is ambivalent about weed and he doesn't explicitly disapprove of my usage.  He has other patients that use weed regularly and are able to have success in love, work, and play.

Have any of  you out there gone through a similar experience as me or have similar conflicted feelings about weed?  Is the only acceptable solution to quit 100% and hope my depression lifts via other methods.

Been a lurker here since end of 2018, when I decided to quit smoking cigs. It’s been such a safe space since! I’m coming back here now with a fresh mission: to quit both weed and cigs.

A short backstory. I kept at quitting cigs for a year and a half. Then the pandemic hit. I have been on and off at both cigs and weed, and struggling to stay straight since June. Tho proud to say that in the first 3 mos of heavy lockdown, I have been sober and never felt really good, physically and spiritually. However, mentally, my baseline was always anxious and I couldn’t really focus on anything except managing the anxiety daily. Granted that all rules of not being okay are out of the window with this pandemic. So I was trying to be gentle to myself. But when the lockdown eased up, it’s as if, I’ve turned back to smoking with a bang! Out of revenge. Like the world owes me! I must have spent equal to a year’s worth of weed budget in the last 5 months. I’m a freelancer in the film scene and with the entire industry coming to a halt, money’s been tight. I shouldn’t really be spending on vices. But my brain does exactly the opposite. Perhaps out of fear and anxiety; or my rebellious streak, that devil-may-care attitude that’s worked for me in many ways. But I feel that with smoking, that has to change NOW. I’m approaching mid-30s and my life is nowhere close to how I imagined it should be at this point. I have bad skin, single, I’m still renting and work prospects are on a downlow in the foreseeable future. Not that I blame all of these on smoking. But I need to give myself reasons to trust me again. And smoking is the one thing I have power over. I hope.

I see windows of opportunities on my table and it’s becoming clearer that to be able to cease them: I need to be sober and ready. Without the foggy high and lure of alternate realities; of imagined possibilities or the life I could have that makes me giddy and hopeful when high. Not those. Because I actually have a pretty promising life right now. If only, I can get out of my own way.

When I decided to quit cigs in 2018, after coming back home from Europe, depressed and broke, I had pondered on quitting weed too. That’s how I stumbled upon this community. At that time, I had already started coming to terms that my weed habit has become unmanageable. After 6 years of being high almost every day. (My breaks would be when I go out and shoot out-of-town or travel domestic and abroad. So say, that would be a total of 6 mos every year.) Almost half of my year, every year for the last 6-7 yrs, always high. And here’s the real kicker, I love it. So in 2018, I knew I could only give up on either cig or weed. I kept the weed and kept out of cigs until before the pandemic. 

Now I’ve come to a point where every time I smoke weed, I get all the more impulsive and it leads me straight to smoking cigs again. Either that or I roll more Js. So, it’s clear: both has to stop.

Seeing all the posts here is reassuring. At first, it was hard to wrap my head around being too dependent on weed. I mean, is that even possible? What with the entire world shifting gears and legalising weed. Now more people have become open to its wonders, and here I am, with my counter narrative. It’s like I’m being uncool and it’s unbecoming of me. As if I’m betraying the entire movement of mind-liberators and freedom-loving kins. It was hard to accept this at first. But knowing now that I’m not alone in the struggle helps me embrace my own truth. I can love weed and love myself too. And maybe that means we have to keep our distance until I can trust myself again with it.

Coming out in here is a way to be more accountable with my resolve at quitting. I see how supportive this community is and perhaps that’s what I need to keep going. I’ve never really talked to anyone about my weed habit. Not in a liberating way, at least. Definitely not as detailed as the things I’ve shared here. Mainly, because it’s literally a life-and-death situation out here. I live in a country notorious for its war-on-drugs. On top of that, I have various sets of friends and none of them get it, I think. There are those I work with in the art scene who revere weed (as I do) and are fine with the lifestyle. Then there’s those set of girlfriends who have no idea how awesome weed is. So I think they will just be judgemental about my predicament. 

Jeez, I said short backstory! I didn’t mean to write a novella out here. So thanks if you’ve gotten this far.

I would love to hear any strategies that’s worked for you on a daily basis. Please share away! I really need more pratical tips to survive the next few months. Because I am fully aware that my real problem will not change: to my core, I love weed. I didn’t smoke until I was in my mid-20s and I’ve since been changed. Mostly, for the better. I’ve opened up in ways that I didn’t even think possible. I’ve become more accepting of many realities and peoples. It has been easier to deal with childhood traumas and all of life’s hardships. With my work, I’ve seen levels of poverty that few people can stomach. I’ve seen death, disasters and misery. I’ve talked to mothers who buried their own children, children who lost everything and I live in a country that disempowers its own people in the most insidious of ways. So relative to what I do, weed has been a sanity saver. I have never really known what peace is until I met weed. And it’s that peace that I keep returning to. But then, it has become like a bubble, and the reality—my actual life—outside of that bubble is slowly and surely slipping away. I feel like that I can do more things and offer more if I can just rise above this foggery.",8,"{'pandemic': 3, 'lockdown': 2}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9966448545455933}"

Not sure what to do.,"I am not really sure what I am writing about in this post, I guess it would just be nice to talk to someone about this as it is something I am battling on my own.

So I have been clean for a few months now. I lost my job immediately after graduating with an engineering degree and smoked for a month or so because of it.  I stopped early August after I ran out because I felt finding a new job was more important to me. This has been the longest break I have ever taken, before that was the stretch between March to May this year to get the job I then lost.  Before that, I had never taken a break for more than a few days and I've been smoking since I was 17. Now, I found a job I really like and am moving to a legal state. They do not drug test and it has made me rethink whether or not I want to smoke again. 

I have always been a motivated person, though marijuana has changed that in me at times. I have always used it in conjunction with the hobbies I enjoy, especially art. However, once I smoke, I usually do not stop until all the weed is gone. I have been on r/Petioles for years, but I have never really taken their lessons to heart. I have always felt completely abstaining works best for me. I really like smoking, it relaxes me, but at the same time it can make me anxious. 

So has anyone else experienced something like this? You leave weed behind to get further ahead and now that you have obtained what you want, you want to go back to smoking?

I (think) I have many hobbies, all of which just do not entertain me the way they used to. I don't want to experience the outdoors. I have not felt real intimacy in a while. Nor joy, nor pain.

I wanted to make this post because I want to share the tips that I’ve read on here that have helped me the most!

- Don’t be mad at yourself for relapsing. It will only lead to more negativity and more cravings. That being said, don’t go back to it everytime you quit 😂
- Learn to find your addiction voice (I read this from someone on here). It is the tiny voice in your head that says just a little.... why not just once..... 
If you give into these cravings, your desire to smoke will immediately rush in along with maybe anxiety. 
- There is no magic number when you become normal again. Recovery is not linear. There are good days and bad days. I have been dealing with lots of depression, anxiety, and my mental health has been quite poor. But this doesn’t mean I go back to smoking weed. It gives me more reason not to. I am improving every day and I am proud of myself for how far I have come. 

And to be honest, don’t replace your weed addiction with another vice (drinking, jacking off, etc). Don’t even go there. It may not negatively impact your journey, but no. Just don’t. 

I know this number isn’t anything crazy but I want to thank this subreddit because it is truly what got me to put it down. I tried quitting before bur I never had the love and confidence to do so until I stumbled here. 

GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE. YOU CAN FUCKING DO IT. THINK OF YOURSELF AS A KID. WOULD YOU HAVE SEEN YOURSELF BECOMING CONSUMED BY WEED AND LETTING IT DESTROY YOUR GOALS AND MENTAL HEALTH? THE YOUNG YOU WOULD HAVE JUST WANTED TO BE NORMAL AND LIVE LIFE. LAUGH, CRY, AND LOVE. ❤️❤️",11,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.904635488986969}"

 I've been 19 days clean right now, and I don't really feel too much of an urge right now. But before quitting, I was smoking ""only"" once a day, about a gram every 1-2 weeks and I feel like I am not really afraid of going back to old habits. I stopped because I was tired of not knowing if I was different without it, I wanted to improve my memory, and I felt like it was keeping me from gaining some better habits (reading, writing..). But right now, when I feel upset or I want to have time for myself, I have a hard time rationalizing that I need to do it sober. It doesn't feel that important tbh.

(Finding an excuse to go back to smoking need some help rationally),"I been sober about 2 weeks now. The urge is getting to me. I feel crippling anxiety in the mornings since i stopped smoking. I smoked heavily since corona lockdown (pretty much high 24/7) before that I smoked occasionally. 

Something about it makes me feel guilty. I want to be sharp and my mind focused. I want to go back to school for another degree but obviously I can’t being high all the time.

However I thought to myself today: well can’t anything be bad in excess? If I was an avid hiker and hiked non stop and neglected my friends and family, isn’t that bad? If I worked out to the point that my knees gave out from the strain of lifting heavy isn’t that bad? If I had non stop sex all the time isn’t that bad? ( if I had a girlfriend haha) 

Why can’t I just smoke? If it brings happiness to my life why should I quit? Isn’t it my life to do as I please? Why do I have to stop this?

Yet... something is telling me to stop. Yet I crave it every second of the day. I miss playing video games and eating my favorite snack while high and being super focused and listening to music and the sounds of the music while high just takes me to another place... I miss the comfort. Like a best friend. I felt like I didn’t need anything else but those 3 things.

Video games, weed, and food (surprisingly I’m not even overweight, if anything I need to eat more haha) but yeah I felt I only needed those three things. It brought me happiness. Anyone can relate? 

What I’m doing now: I’m going to the gym more often and sometimes go for a short walk. It’s also during covid I can find an excuse to smoke: “well there’s nothing else to do” I tell myself.

One thing that's helped me a lot, is asking these 2 questions when I feel tempted:

1. What's the worst that could happen if I smoked?

The answer is, I'd regret it. Because I always do. And it will derail my whole day/week, make me feel sluggish, and throw away all my great progress.

2. What's the best-case scenario if I smoked, and what would that lead to?

If I smoked and it didn't affect me badly, or I actually enjoyed it, I know that would just give me a false sense of security. With that false sense of security, I'd most likely buy more weed and keep doing it. The addiction would fool me into thinking I could moderate, or that something has changed. In reality, it hasn't. 

The moral: all best-case scenarios lead to your worst-case scenario, when you have an addiction.

I'm happy to report that I will be 3-weeks clean tomorrow! 

I've experienced all of the classic withdrawal feelings, both mental and physical, but overall I feel like I'm over the hump. For being a daily smoker for 8-ish years, I think that's pretty remarkable. I'm feeling super grateful.

I do have one question for you all--I can't seem to shake this sore throat. It's not COVID--I genuinely don't have any other symptoms. No fever, no cough, I can breathe fine...

It's also not something that I could treat with antibiotics. About 11 days ago I did a telehealth appt and the doc prescribed me an antibiotic, and as of yesterday, I have finished that round. No relief, but things haven't really escalated either.

Now, I know I need to see my doctor and the good news is, I do have an appointment for my annual exam and bloodwork at the end of next week. 

Until then I'm just trying to alleviate my fears that something major is going on. I tend to go 0-100 when I think my health is in danger and I struggle quite severely with health anxieties. So I'm hoping someone else can share their experience with what may be a chronic sore throat, post smoking.

As I mentioned I really don't have other symptoms. No cough, no fever, no coughing anything up, just a sore, dry throat. Could I have messed with the mucus membranes? I definitely have a lot of dryness in my sinuses as well, and I've done the over the counter stuff, but in the end, I'm still just feeling really worried and isolated that something bad is going on.

Just here to vent. I am 26 years old and having difficulty quitting weed. I love smoking (5 years of smoking) but it is literally ruining my life. Before weed I was an athlete (semi-pro bound) and very self disciplined despite being around people who lacked motivation. Now, i'm constantly surrounded by guys who are smoking all the time. The good thing is I cut most of them out but my cravings keep coming back at night ( i don't smoke during the day). Some of these guys were my friends for my entire life.

The problem is, i waste so much money on food - uber eats (up to 30-60 dollars a meal). I also gained 20lbs because of this. At the same time i can't study even when im sober because of the amount i smoked the previous night. I had huge goals but I keep delaying them because i don't feel like doing anything after a night of smoking. Time seems to keep flying and I had the same thoughts for a couple years now. The biggest disappointment is becoming out of shape and delaying my studies for over a couple years. I also never feel like socializing with anyone including family or women after being high. It's affecting money, relationships with women, family, goals, and health at this point.

I recently bought a home gym so i'm hoping I can start getting back on track with diet and gym since I won't be leaving the house as often.  Any words of encouragement are appreciated.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9963162541389465}"

I ofc have plans to replace the time i spent smoking with another activities, and have been avoiding those friends for now. But, is it possible that i could regain control of it, not anytime soon but 3 years from now?

Everyday after work weed would be my whiskey. Smoke 5-10 bowls between the hours of 5-11pm. To me as a skinny kid that was a lot. Sometimes I'd sit outside just cause it was nice and breezy and finish back to back bowls heavily packed.

Just before I quit I started to have zero appetite to where I would make plain pasta and force my self to eat it. Only consuming roughly 6xx calories a day. It was just terrible. I started to think something was wrong with my health so I went on a bender with Google. Strongly suggest to anyone to never do that. I had panic attacks after panic attacks. I started to check my stool every single time to make sure I don't have any sort of internal bleeding. Checking charts on everything. I seriously thought I had cancer an ulcer diabetes anemic. It was terrible

I eventually when to the doctor's office and got tons of blood work done and test to make sure I'm healthy.  Turns out I was fine.

I went to find some help and got a shrink to help me through anxiety and depression (covid 19 has hard stricken my money where I was negative on my accounts at all times knowing that I had to feed my self and pay bills)

Long time lurker, even longer time smoker. Today is the first day I’m making a serious effort to kick this weed addiction. I’ve been aware of the addiction for a while now but haven’t been able to change the lifestyle. Weed might not be as physically addictive than other substances but shit, the mental addiction is real. It doesn’t help that I started when I was 15 the night before my moms funeral. Weed disconnected my from the weird & depressing reality of my world at that moment. Weed let me concede responsibility for my actions without feeling guilty about it. Weed let me alienate myself from people who went out of their way to help me, people who love(d) me and people who I love(d). 

I’d sober up, feel awful & go smoke another J to forget about the situation. Vicious cycle. 

Somehow I managed to graduate high school & got into college with pretty low grades (DDC). 

I’ve always been good at putting on a facade (at least for a short period of time) which got me into an interview for a college I wanted to go to. After the interview & testing I was given an unconditional offer & a scholarship. After I achieved this, I sort of crumbled, couldn’t handle the idea that I’d gotten over the worst & I just needed to put the effort in. I continued smoking tonnes of weed & somehow managed to complete my first year with literally no studying and about 50% attendance. Second year came around & my degree was to specialise. I hated the specialty which made it easier to smoke since it was my escape from it. In my divine wisdom I completed half the years modules and got an OK grade because the non specialist modules were pretty easy. I didn’t hand a single piece of work in for my specialty & that made me fail the year. I was in the same awful state of mind but was terrified of leaving the safety net of college & student loans so I convinced my uni to let me retake the year. I did nothing that year. All I had to do was my specialty subject but no, I sat down smoking weed and playing video games with my flatmates. I was living with people who went to my college and we all smoked but they all put in more effort than I did. At the end of that year my friends graduated and I didn’t. I dropped out & if I’m honest, I felt better than I had for a long time for it. Apart from the sense of failure & stupidity mind you. 40k in debt to sit down and smoke. Fuck me right.

Now where am I. Nearly 22, Living in a friends spare room & wondering wtf I’m doing with my life. I’ve tried to stop smoking multiple times and only ever manage cutting down or swapping skunk for hash. In recent months, I’ve taken up exercise, cooking, trading stocks, learning Italian & guitar. However, I still feel like a piece of shit because I smoke everyday. I still feel like I half ass everything & am not worth the help my friends have given me. I need to get a full time job & be self sufficient. I’m burning through my savings (student loan debt) and it’s quickly running out. I’m terrified of failure, I’ve lost faith in the world around me but I think it’s time to finally be an adult and take these issues head on. 

My weed problem has ruined the opinion I have of myself, believing that I’m a fake person that’s unworthy of the many good things I did have left in my life as well as thinking I was cheating my way through my education & therefore life. During high school I revelled in the fact I could get away with what I wanted and the things I did would never seem to have any consequences. Ie, challenging teachers authority, skipping lessons, leaving lessons to go make coffee in the staff office. Yes, I really took liberties and even my classmates were baffled. But now looking back, I was an idiot. Capable of the work but wanting to find an easier way around it. 


Fuck it. I’m done with the plant. Maybe one day we can have a healthy relationship but not right now.

Sorry for the rant & the disjointed structure of it all. It do be like that sometimes.

Thought i'd share. Was a really interesting exercise and I'd highly recommend it. Context: been smoking for 13 years, been trying to quit for at least 5.

What I like about weed

1. It means i'm never bored and I don't feel lonely. It keeps me occupied all night
2. It's such an ingrained habit that it feels like home
3. It feeds my addiction to tobacco and cannabis
4. I love the feeling and ritual of rolling and smoking something
5. It makes mundane things more interesting

What I don't like about weed

1. I spend about £150-200 per month on weed
2. It makes me anxious to talk to people, by text or meeting up in person
3. It takes my spare time so I don't work toward things I will value in the future
4. It makes me OK with being adequate
5. It's bad for my health
6. It stops me from making plans with other people
7. It makes me a worse communicator
8. I sleep badly and get up late
9. It makes me less likely to stick to daily healthy habits like exercise and meditation
10. I am ashamed of my addiction and have been for about ten years

What an incredible community, I'm so grateful for all of your stories and advice. I'm on day 9 of sobriety and I've been noticing, particularly at night, how white the whites of my eyes are lol. 

I just finished Matthew Clarke's ""Quitting Weed"" and it was everything I need right now. I highly recommend this for anyone who thinks they have a problem. I'm 30 now and spent much of my twenties battling addiction to harder drugs and rebuilding my life from the fallout, financially and otherwise. While I understand addiction well, I always had this exception in my mind for cannabis. ""If I'm only vaping pot, it's ok in comparison"" is what I'd say to myself. I refused to see it as an addiction. But of course that's not true. The denial is very real. I've been abstinent from hard drugs and alcohol for years but I've always left the door open for weed. 

Looking back and combing my journals this week, it's very clear that the best periods have been the ones when I was completely sober. It has never lasted more than 2 months because I always let weed back in, believing the myth that I could moderate. Summer 2019 in particular was a high point. No hard drugs, alcohol, weed or caffeine and I was at a peak: fit, eating right, making progress in my mindfulness practice, completing the best projects of my life at work, reading tons of books and growing spiritually. I credit that period with developing the insights that led to me quitting this time. It seems so obvious now. I've done so much work on myself in the past decade and it's hard waking up to the reality that I've had this blind spot for weed. It's literally exactly the same as every other drug I've put behind me but more insidious in some ways because the drawbacks are more subtle than spending 50k on powders in 3 years, for example (which I've done...and much much worse).

I've been very fortunate in my professional life that I've still been able to make an okay living and progress to management, despite not finishing university due largely to my battles with drugs. I know I'm nowhere near my potential though. I've had a lot of lucky breaks and I've leaned on people who enabled me, let me live with them for free, loaned me money, etc. I finally rented my own apartment in Toronto this year and I'm paying my own way for the first time in my life. It feels amazing to stand on my own feet and be master of what goes on under this roof. I realize that part of what I was numbing was that suspicion that I couldn't be self-reliant. I felt like a parasite for a long time and that really impacts your self worth. Having the distance and the space to truly sit alone with my thoughts and carve out a life for myself was key to getting here. 

It took a long time for me to understand that I am responsible for my emotions and the way I react to life's circumstances. There is no space in a healthy adult mind for blaming others, even when we have every right to. I ask the universe every day to take my resentments from me. It's a ritual that reminds me to be kind and focus on what I can control. 

It's been a rough week. My stomach is fucked, my moods are erratic and sleep is a luxury weaved in with the craziest vivid dreams I've ever had in my life. I didn't even have energy for sex last night lol. Le sigh. I've been down this road enough times to know withdrawal when I see it. It gets better every day though. The fog is clearing and I have long stretches of extreme focus, clarity and emotional stability during my workday that have been foreign to me for quite some time. I've filled my fridge with groceries and I'm forcing myself to make and consume nutritious meals every day. No more wasted money on garbage delivered food. The weight gain and debt will fall away in time as my activity level increases, I know this and it gives me drive to keep going. I've also stopped watching tv, which is astonishing. I've watched so many reruns of Rupaul's Drag Race you wouldn't believe it! 😜

All this to say, I'm looking forward with optimism and it feels so different this time because I've accepted that it's an addiction and the only way out is to never touch it again. I have a metaphorical box (I refer to it in my journals as ""la boite"") into which I've put the hard drugs, prescription drugs that I didn't need, nicotine and alcohol as I gave them up. The box is not to be opened. Cannabis is now in there too and I know it's the best decision I've made in years. I hope this helps someone as I've been helped by stumbling upon this group. I wouldn't have had the energy to do this 9 days ago and that alone is telling. Thank you to everyone who's taken the time to post here. 

For those of you starting out or starting again, stay strong and take a look at your eyes the next time you're in front of the mirror. Clarity is a beautiful thing. What we're gaining is life itself and that's worth the pain to get there.

Relax and be kind to yourself and those around you. Find humor in your circumstances wherever you can. Laughter is a great pressure release when things get overwhelming, allows you to step back and get some oxygen to the brain.

6 days ago, I got caught by the police and I decided to tell my parents whats happened. So here I am. I'm living with my dad, my mother works at another city. It's hard to live with him. It's hard to live with all these regrets.

I'm the only guilty one here. All things are my fault. I cry a lot btw. I cannot look my parents eyes. I cannot find any tv shows that takes my thoughts away. 

Only programming takes my brain to somewhere.. I got ps4 with no games(I cannot afford it, silly isn't it?). I got dreams with no possibilities.

The other side of that is my appetite and sleep have been shit and even though I've been applying for a new PT job (I also have my own pet care business), meditating, exercising, setting a schedule to distract myself from cravings, and writing/journaling my feelings and progress, I'm just so exhausted and my mind is still constantly telling me to just give up and ""celebrate"" getting through the week. My family has been great about being there for emotional support too, and I know I would feel terrible about letting them down, in a way. 

I turned 30 this year and it really hit me hard that this is the year I need to make the change so I can further my potential in life. I want to learn how to be my real self again. I want to be more attentive and genuinely contribute more to the relationships of those who care about me.

I am on day 2 of my detox.
Last night, I woke up around 2-3 am and I felt so joyful by the simple fact that I was able to recall my dream. Even though I wasn’t able to fall asleep after, I felt fresh during my busy day. 

I reached a certain degree of maturity as I turned 25 . This second wave opened my eyes and put me in the right path to become the optimal version of myself.

There are so many things to enjoy in life.
I intend to try astral projection if someone has some tips would be much appreciated 

I meditate, drink tons of water, run , work and study in my last year at university. As I stop smoking I hope I find more time  to produce my music .
I don’t have much time for friends as they often vibrate on a lower frequency and I enjoy more my own company. 

Can’t wait to find my new equilibrium in life and keep going on a clean path. I do this for myself but I hope I’ll find a girl on my journey. 

I don’t regret anything I’ve done so far in life and look forward to observe what the world of dreams has reserved on stage for me tonight.

Long story short: after quitting hash for 2 months, my throat muscle pain (started after quitting) became unbearable. Then I noticed that smoking hash is the only thing that helps relaxing my throat muscles instantly. I could buy the non-smoking version, but I'm a student with a big debt so I can't really afford it. I've been doing speech therapy for 2 months, but it doesn't help as much as weed. What would you recommend?

Context: For the past 6 years I have smoked some hash about 3 times a week. Sometimes, while going on a vacation for example, I didn't smoke and anything voice-related was fine.

However, during the pandemic I smoked almost every evening. In the end of June I decided to stop. It all went well for 2 months; except my throat muscles started to hurt so much that I barely could talk.

That's when I decided to go to a speech therapist and got diagnosed with Muscle Tension Dysphonia (MTD). She helps me with breathing the right way while talking, resonance and massaging my throat muscles.

Although it helps a bit, I find that the only thing that réálly helps is to smoke hash. That's when I feel like my muscles are totally relaxed; which isn't strange, since it relaxes muscles after all.

My main fear is that l'm doomed the throat muscle tension will never stop.. at least not without hash. But I'm rather not be dependent on the drugs. I feel like I'm ready for a new phase in my life without hash. But the pain becomes so bad at times, that it really feels like that it's the only that helps instantly.

I've been smoking for 20+ years with only a 2 year break while I was in trade school (8 years ago) and a few short tolerance breaks here and there. I honestly didn't feel that much better during that break, but I've come to the realization that at that time I had some other unresolved issues that kept a black cloud hanging over me whether I was sober or not. Since that time I've been taking steps to manage my anxiety and have come to the conclusion that I need to take cannabis out of the picture again to see what effect it's having on me. Other reasons to quit include feeling guilty for spending a good bit of money on it that could go to more positive causes, looking forward to getting away from my girlfriend and her son who I love very much just to get high,  and wanting to retain more of the things I enjoy learning about. For a long time I told myself smoking wasn't an issue for me as my usage and tolerance has gotten pretty low compared to my younger days, but I still stay high all day every day except when spending time with the gf and son, and as I said above, it is having negative impacts on my life. I also have a hard time figuring out exactly what it is that I enjoy about it. At this point I think it's just the ritual, the taste, and smell. Fortunately this time around the withdrawals aren't as bad as they've been through many of my breaks. I've just been feeling numb and totally lack motivation. I'm on my fifth day of a five day vacation from work and feel like I've just been staring at the wall most of the time aside from a failed attempt at a camping trip with gf and son (that's another story). I'm two weeks in to the process, I've only been smoking what little I had at night to help with sleep.

On my days off I would hide myself in my room away from everyone and go down the rabbit hole. Now I am more present for my life and family, and instead of being reclusive I actively look for opportunities to be around others.

  I started feeling the changes 3 weeks in, I started to feel again. I reacted to my successes with happiness, my neurotransmitters weren’t constantly getting bombarded making them desensitized to sober life.

I can’t explain how good life feels again, and even when it isn’t feeling good I’m sober enough to want to fix it. Cheers

Just wanted to say thank you to everyone on this sub- your inspiring stories and motivating words have helped me accomplish something I never fathomed as a reality for me. Today marks 1 week clean for me after 5 years of daily marijuana usage. 

To those just starting their journey, hang in there! Days 1-3 were the worst, but once you get past the hump, you start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Some side effects I've experienced include shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite, and just overall feeling shitty. I found eating soup sits pretty well, and you can convince yourself to eat it (kind of... baby steps), even if nothing else sounds remotely appetizing. 

Sleep really changes after stopping marijuana usage. Weed suppresses REM sleep so when you quit, your brain bounces back pretty hard. REM sleep is when you dream, so I have had a lot of vivid dreams. Granted, it's been mostly nightmares, but when I wake up in the mornings I feel physically different, more rested and less tired. 

I hope my story can help others out there who are taking this step in their lives. As someone who struggles greatly with anxiety, it's been a challenge giving up my vices. I quit nicotine about 3 months ago and weed a week ago, and I feel like I'm a new person. You can do this!

So day 45 for me now. It was our angel babies 2nd birthday yesterday and get this, my support dog ran away the day before. I can't find her anywhere. I'm devastated. But, we have posters everywhere and our community is helping us search for her. I hope she comes home soon. 

It was a rough day full of emotions from worrying about my dog to missing my baby boy and knowing we hit another birthday without him here. I was panicking, shaking and just not having a good morning. We almost called off the party. But I said no no let's push on.

We were overwhelmed by support. Our friends showed up early in the day and stayed until 11pm. They sang happy birthday for our boy when we just weren't strong enough to do so, and the best part of it all, I wasn't masked. I was purely feeling it all without any medication in the way. No more weed to numb me.

This road is painful as hell, especially knowing just 5 months ago I was doing so good. I had my life totally under control. I was smoking every day, but slowly my body and mind started healing and little did I know that the pot was actually holding me back from dealing with the grief. I'm thankful though. Because the pot did show me what a good life I can achieve as a grieving parent WITHOUT weed. That I'm not doomed to live as a depressed person for the rest of my life. I don't have to live by the stigma that people put on those who lose their babies. 

My life is really shit right now, but It could always be worse. I know I'm riddled with anxiety, depression, I can hardly eat and I can't workout anymore. But I know that every single day, im healing. I'm dealing with this properly now and it's going to shape me into a way stronger person than weed ever could have made me feel. That's my goal anyways. 

I see a psychiatrist every week and she works through the grief with me and the withdrawal symptoms. I'm seeking other helpful therapies as well. I know I can be that happy person again without the weed. I know I can enjoy life again. But once you take that pot away, you do feel everything you used it to hide from. You come face to face with your worst fears. And that's okay. You need to fight. Battle. Learn every possible tool, and guess what? This too shall pass. Weather it's a few months, a year or several years, every step you take will be easier than the last. 

I still have a very hard road ahead, but I like to believe that the worst of it is behind me and that the symptoms I'm still experiencing at day 45, anxiety, depression, derealization, insomnia, they will and are subsiding. 

For those of you who have extreme trauma you are masking with the weed and want to face reality. It will be okay. I fucking promise you. It's going to suck for a while, but you will be okay! Get yourself a therapist and a doctor on your side. Let them know you want to quit, they will help you. Build your support group to lean on, you are cared about and loved beyond your expectation. We never give ourselves enough credit. You don't have to be shackled anymore. You are strong enough and you are worth pure, unmasked happiness.

This is the realization that made me quit: I’ll never be the best version of myself if I’m high. Once I accepted that, quitting was easy. Addiction is a mindset problem. There may be some physical symptoms but the truth is that you are smoking for a psychological reason. Most people love to have an excuse for their short comings. You failed that test because you were high, you didn't get that girl's number because you were high, etc. That's what you tell yourself and your friends.

&#x200B;

When you become sober you have to start to blame yourself for everything and that's hard to do. In the first year of being sober I was desperate to blame other things, I would convince myself that I was sick or that my situation was someone else's fault. I went to the doctor like 5-6 times that year. But finally I realized that this was just another mindset problem. Be very careful not to develop another outlet for your excuses while finding sobriety because that will lead you down another destructive path. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*The amazing thing is that when you start to blame yourself for your problems you start to give yourself the power to change. Its hard in the beginning but after a year your confidence doubles and it doubles again the year after that. So now 3 years sober, I don't even think about weed anymore. I don’t even care. I don’t need it. And by the way, life is 10 times better now than when I was smoking. 

&#x200B;

If you are here on r/leaves you've already started to make the right decision. Quitting isn't easy but its a process and it happens over time. It's extremely important to make a commitment to bettering yourself; you need to start setting goals and executing instead of quitting and expecting good things to happen. For the first few months I suggest going easy on yourself, you're going to be very vulnerable. If you want to watch TV, watch TV, if you want a cookie, have a cookie. Don't pitty yourself but instead grow from the pain. Spend less time with your friends that aren't motivated or hungry for success, they probably won't understand what you're trying to accomplish here. 

&#x200B;

Have a dream. One thing that comes with having more confidence is that you start to believe that you can achieve more and more. If you have a dream that you previously thought was unattainable, it might not seem so far fetched now. Start working towards that. I started by setting myself a ridiculous goal and just grinding towards it to see what would happen (when I say ridiculous I really mean pie in the sky ridiculous). Well 2 years in and I'm closer than I thought I would be to my dream becoming a reality, the results have been unexpected and incredible.

&#x200B;

I've become fluent in Korean, I've learned to juggle, I've ran marathons, I've learned to code well in at least 5 languages, I've launched a business and several side projects, met way more girls and more. The more you achieve the more you will achieve and it compounds every year. Who knows where I will be in the next 2 years but I can promise you I'll be making big moves. THAT is what keeps me excited every day and seeing myself grow has been a hugely rewarding experience.

&#x200B;

Smoking weed now just seems like such a waste of time and health now. I regret those 6 years that I smoked because if I had put in work 24/7 instead I would probably own an island by now. Look, the first few months are hard, you're going to have to break yourself down and build yourself back up. But once that happens I promise you won't ever relapse again.

&#x200B;

Just remember, you have the power to do anything you want. The unfortunate thing is that probably only 1 in 100 who read this will understand and start trying to live better. I told myself that I would post a message like this some day to pass on what I have learned. I didn't know when but 3 years sober seems like the right time. If I can give at least one person an epiphany then its been worth it.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I'm not saying everything is perfect for me now, I still have some struggles and areas on which I want to improve. But all in all I am MILES ahead of where I was. To be honest, I'm not even close to the same person I was 3 years ago. Totally different. And I know that you are probably going through some horrible situation now and believe me I've been there before too. We are all human. But if not now, when? And if not us, who?

EDIT:

Thanks for reading! If this post made you feel better, that really makes me happy. This is just to follow-up  and answer a few questions. 

I haven’t experimented with other drugs. I drink a few times a year socially, nothing too excessive.

I learned to code online and through friends.

I would say I started to feel normal again after about 1 year. I smoked regularly for 5 years though, someone who smoked for 20+ years would probably take longer. 

Theres going to be some bad days in the first 3 months but its nothing you can’t handle. Just do whatever you can to keep yourself positive. Watch a disney movie, listen to only upbeat music, whatever. It doesn’t matter, just avoid negativity at all costs. Seriously. 

I’m not saying that my issue was the same as yours but in my opinion the majority of people who have an addiction problem with weed have a fear of failure which is rooted in low self-esteem (you might not even realize it though). Being stoned is a great excuse for failing and it feels good too. Being high is a safe place. If your blazed out of your mind then you can’t be expected to do anything really. And if you keep yourself in a state where you can’t execute then you can’t fail. You can’t win either though.

It took me a long time to realize this. Smoking weed wasn’t the problem. It was a symptom of the problem. Get to the root of the issue. 

Blaming yourself is actually a really powerful tool. Try to implement it as much as you can. Even when other people make mistakes, see what you could have done in that situation. Don’t go overboard but trust me, do it for a year and watch how powerful you become. 

The other key for me was to set goals and complete them. I started by having a list of easy things, clean my room, make a sandwich, etc. And got used to crossing things off. Every item you cross off the list increases your self confidence a bit. Bigger items yield bigger boosts. Keep adding items onto your list and make them gradually harder. Make it your mission to execute things every day. Every goal you complete makes you better. I’ve been doing it for 2 years and now I’m addicted to completing goals. 

Also, people used to suggest that I get on medication or see a psychologist but I didn’t feel that was the answer for me . You might be different I don’t know, but I suggest you don’t immediately try those and instead see what you can do on your own. You got yourself into this situation, you can probably get yourself out. 

Let me just finish by saying that weed is a dead end. You already know this. When I said that my realization made quitting easy, what I really meant was it made it inevitable. I had to make a decision.  If I wanted to start achieving things, quitting was the only option. So then the question became: quit now or later? The answer to that was easy. 

You’ve already decided you want to quit, thats why you’re here. I would urge you to follow through. I chose to post on this forum because I know you guys are the ones that want to improve. I wouldn’t say any of this to the stoners I used to know. Life really is a lot better on the other side. Hope this helped.",507,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9936997890472412}"

2020-10-18 09:09:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jdg2h9/has_anyone_else_ever_relapsed_and_still_felt_the/,Has anyone else ever relapsed and still felt the effects of cold turkey and the feelings that come with it afterwards?,"I have a confession, after roughly a 2 week period of being cold turkey and not smoking, I folded. I wasn’t under any peer pressure, but I decided to myself for my own reasons. I originally went cold turkey because I was tired of chasing weed in a sense and having to always have it, so I said fuck it and no more, at least for a big break. It was only then that I felt my very first withdrawal effects of ganja, learning that this is a real thing.

The first thing I’ll say is that I’m really happy that I went cold turkey in the first place because of the very real lessons that I learned about weed and it’s power, as well as the feeling of experiencing withdrawals and the impact of that reality.

The one thing I have noticed about relapsing is that I don’t feel like I’ve rewound time to before I did cold turkey. I don’t feel like I’m back to square one at all because the impact of the withdrawals and anxiety that comes with it has stayed in my head and those emotions that come with it definitely haven’t left me.

I don’t necessarily think it’s the guilt for me that is a factor at all - I think for most who quit and go cold turkey after smoking throughout the day/night for X amount of time will experience both the anxiety because of withdrawal as well as facing real life problems and worries (of any extent) that one may have, bringing a more ‘purer’ form of anxiety that, for example, I have about my own life. 

It’s almost like a mix between both worlds and it’s not very nice, and I was wondering who else has had a similar experience with this?

It’s like, just because I smoked again doesn’t mean all my thoughts have gone away back to before I went cold turkey, you know, like almost carefree prior to then. For one thing, I will NEVER go back to smoking aimlessly from the early afternoon onwards or everyday, I have already turned that corner and the effects of heavy use have completely scared me off ever doing that again for good.

Being sober for a bit has made my real life worries hit me head on like a freight train but x100. That’s not going to leave me now that the impact of that purer anxiety has hit me because I realise I need to sort my shit out big time, smoke or no smoke.

For example, I was made redundant and then COVID hit, making it virtually impossible to reestablish my working life, let alone finding a good job during this ongoing time. It is making me freak the fuck out even though everyone’s life is still kind of on ‘hold’ in some degree, at least here in the U.K.

The big anxiety comes from the thoughts of change, whether it be finding new work, the future, anything.

I was diagnosed with C-PTSD at the beginning of this year and have been doing therapy since. I'll be moving onto some more intense trauma therapy in around a year or so, which I have to be sober in order to do.

Weed has been a crutch for me for about 10 years now. I smoke every single day, far too much a day. I notice that if I don't have it, my trauma symptoms are way way worse and it helps me to level out in general. I absolutely lose control if I don't have smoke, I can't focus, I'm constantly triggered and in a flashback, my anxiety is raised 10000%
I find it basically impossible to function at all. I guess recently I had a few days off, which were terrifying but they helped me to recognise how much of my mental health I'm masking with weed. It feels like it helps because it masks my symptoms.

I know I've gotta quit in atleast a years time, I've been told to do it slowly because it'll be too much for me to just quit at once. I struggle with chronic pain too and just have no idea how I'm gonna manage without it.

I know in the long run, it is absolutely the best thing to do and it is something I have thought about for such a long time now. But I am absolutely terrified of how long it'll take me to feel the benefits and how much time I will spend feeling awful with the PTSD

So anyways about a month ago i was sitting in my room i had went to perform my typical ritual and roll up some cannabis in a blunt did this around 10.30pm on a saturday night proceeded to smoke half of it seemed ok after around 1am decided to light up the other half which was around 2 and a half hours later finished it off.

I was starin at an article on my tv which i use as a computer screen not really thinking about nothing i decide i might need alil bit more so i take a fresh piece and proceed to put some in my glass pipe and take a hit.

Next thing you know my vision goes blurry my chest hurts i seem worried i jump up out of my chair and its like i am gasping for air i feel dizzy light headed and like i might drop to the ground .

Next thing you know i am pacing around my room i go down stairs to try and talk to someone i live with and i tell them i dont feel good they do not quite understand what i am telling them. i try to explain that i have smoked too much pot i think and i am worried i go outside to get some fresh air feels like my chest is beating hard.

I go back up stairs message a friend he suggests i drink some water so i do that i suck down 2 bottles nothing happens so about  2 hours  later i still feel really off i message the guy again he says try a hot shower so i do that after i feel about 20% better but still off . i try to sleep i pass out but wake up once sweating.

Next day i get up around 1030 am i feel somewhat better and normal for some reason i decide to meet up with a friend and finish off the last piece i had i mix it in a blunt with what they have half and half i seem ok next thing you know i get dropped off at my driveway and i start to feel nervous and worried  only half as bad as the night before panic.  

Now for several days im not able to sleep good hot sweats at night chest pounding ect i end up going to a walkin clinic because i feel off like worried and i want to pass out blurry vision  they just say i seem anxious thats all cya.

So now im completely off cannabis several days at this point but i still feel off chest pain cant sleep good hot sweats at night wake up soaked cant sleep in my own room  even so im calling my doctors no word for 2 days then finally they say  you can come in on this day if any problems before then goto the hospital. 

so  decide to goto the hospital 2 days later they say even thing checks out  good i seem anxious thats all so they give me something for that 3 days go buy docs office askes about family depression ect they try  and give me something  now after 5 days that was hell  i decide to stop that stuff because of side effects and all went threw more hell but i was starting to sleep normal again starting to get 7-8 hours of sleep.

Now im completely sober been 4-5 weeks still very hard some days i feel better then others brain fog vision issues irritable  at first cramps nerve pain comes and goes sometimes a headache dry mouth dry eyes ect sometimes afraid to go more then 25 mins away slurred speech sometimes words do not come out right or i forget something short term.

like  someone told me  one day at a time l keep telling myself this.  thc is not for everyone i guess and after 25 years i guess my body does not want or need it. 

I just hope my body has not went into a state of panic perminately.

After a year of being sober I felt like coming back into the world again and reconnecting but things aren't the same anymore. I was stupid for thinking friendships would be the same. I used to hang with these two people almost every day and now I'm an outsider to their group and feel like we don't have enough in common anymore. 

I'm very much convinced that now since it's confirmed that I'm still trying to be sober they think they have no reason to hang out with me anymore since I don't smoke. I really think that the only real reason they hang out with each other so much is because they're still addicts together. I remember them not liking each other too much and one of them would only invite the other because he wanted to get smoked out and the other just wanted to come over so he wouldn't have to smoke alone. But now they're supposedly super buddy buddy even more than before and I know that all happened because I left the picture. it's honestly kind of hard to watch because I feel like I'm the only one that acknowledges the truth or even sees it. 

I do miss them, but I don't think they miss me. I've become very sad over it because I don't have other friends. I know there's opportunities to meet others and that growing apart is part of life. I'm just crushed bc I really thought our relationship was more than about weed and I honestly think they are so far deep in their addiction that they don't even see that they are probably only hanging onto each other bc of weed. 

One of them has actually made an effort after I reached out, but I think the other one is making excuses claiming to be busier than he actually is. 

I know how life is when you're always high. The days get swallowed up right before your eyes and time seems to go by faster. One moment it's August and the next it's October but it feels like it has only been two weeks. Lots of things you said you were gonna do, never happened and you forgot to keep up with people. I can only guess that's part of what he's going through. 

Maybe in the future they will realize everything, but also maybe not.

2020-10-17 09:44:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jcvcjh/my_dog_jake/,My dog Jake,"Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right sub to write this in but being it ties into why I was so addicted to weed I thought it might be quiet relatable. As a preface, I am 30 now and at the time of this story I was living with my parents. I've never even thought about this and today is the first time I'm putting this story out in the world in an attempt to forgive myself and move on.

So when I was 25 my families dog, a 115lb Rottweiler named Jake began showing signs of his age. He had what we later found out to be a tumor on his butt. In his final 6 months of his life it was clear the cancer was really taking a toll on this body. In his time he was a very playful, happy and kind pup who taught me what it meant to be loved and to love others, how to be kind and empathetic and just to be accepting of everyone. He cared not who you were, what you liked like or where you came from, he cared only about loving you. I try my best to carry this on in my life after him. 

So, in his last few months of his life, it was slowly becoming clear that he couldn't go on anymore. He began with not going to the basement as the stairs are a bit steeper, next not going upstairs, then only going outside when absolutely necessary. He was not longerbinterested in playing or going for walks.  Finally in his last days he was just peeing himself then laying in it unable to move anymore. Once we saw this week knew it wasn't fair for him to go on any longer so we called the vet to schedule an appointment for euthanasia. I loaded him in the backseat of the truck for one final car ride, we took him to his favourite places, Tim's drive thru for a donut being the final stop before the vet. 

Once we arrived I had to carry him from the backseat into the office and wait for their doctor to come out and chat with us. My father was unable to be part of this and so he sat in the truck, this being the only time I've ever seen or heard of him crying. I waited with Jake a little bit but I couldn't bring myself to stay for the actual act of the needle being put into him. I regret, to this day not staying with him right til the end as I know he would have for me, he was so loyal and loving. I never knew what love was and I'm not ashamed to say I learned it completely from dogs, Jake in particular. After this happened I turned heavily to weed, smoking at my most a bit more than a quarter ounce a day (smoking from sun up to sun down, full bowls all day back to back to back etc.).

 I was trying to numb myself completely. I eventually moved back to British Columbia (Whistler to be exact). One day while back out here I smoked a ton of weed and hiked to the top of a very large clip that was a sheer drop to the ocean (in the next town over called squamish). I stood there for maybe an hour or two, contemplating jumping to my definite demise. The only thing that stopped me were these two girls up around the same area in their hammocks they had hung from some trees over the same cliff. Listening to them talk about their lives and past struggles and how they got past them through putting their efforts into something meaningful was the day my life turned around. At this point I had already done school for photography and was sure that if there was one thing I want to be in this lifetime, it is a photographer. I now focus solely on automotive and motorsports photography in the summer months and snowboarding in the winter. 

I wanted to finish this story off with a message I wish I could have seen sooner. Watching the movie Hachi this morning with my girlfriend, her helping me see all the pain I'm holding was finally the moment I needed to realize I can forgive myself for the pain I feel from not being there in my dogs final moments. He lived a great, long life and taught me lessons I could never be more grateful for. I will be 2 years sober from weed and three from alcohol this coming January 1st. Now able to convey this message in a positive light I just want to say ""love those around you, the kind and the hateful, the optimist and the pessimist, the happy and the sad, for we know not what the other may be going through, Show empathy and love to all and most of all love and forgive yourself.""

Your friend, in happiness

IS REAL. Muscle spasms.. Sweats.. Depression... Insomnia.. Nausea..

In my experience, after relapsing in the past and getting stoned again, it just had a much different high to it because my body and mind had experienced that withdrawal effects were a thing for the very first time time. It kind of made the relapse high guilt ridden because my body was aware of the gravity of withdrawals were actually a thing. Not to mention that the high was different in terms of it felt almost like a trip and not the norm anymore, far more uncomfortable instead to say the least.

Sorry if the the description is repetitive or a mess, I’d be interested of your experiences on this and if it reaffirmed your decision to not relapse again.

First off I’ll say I am an anxious person. I look things up on the internet and see the worse possible results and think it applies to me. With that being said, that doesn’t mean what I’m feeling isn’t real. I stopped smoking about 2 weeks ago. Maybe a week before that Sept. 16th I start feeling bad. Very nauseous. A week later i felt better. One week after that October 1st I started to feel bad again. Super nauseous , started to get acid reflux more often and head hurting. This has persisted to even now as I speak. The thing is... it’s hard to swallow, I feel this lump in my throat and I barely really want to eat even though I do. 

A little background real quick before I finish this...

I’ve always kinda had acid reflux on and off. Since a kid in the mornings my stomach would always hurt. I begin to feel this acid reflux / lump in throat/ super full type of feeling once I got in high school. Wasn’t often but it happened. I believe weed masked this or slightly eased it. When I use to get high I use to always feel this fullness (now what I think is acid) in my stomach and lump in my throat. I thought it was the weed irritating my throat. And on top of it in the morning it I start to notice it become hard to swallow ...like I can feel the food travel down my esophagus. Fast forward to the present>>>>>>>



I went to the doctor yesterday because im worried. She wrote down GERD but didn’t tell me “you have GERD” she just wrote it down on her pad. She offered that I take this test that can detect harmful bacteria that could be the precursor to cancer. She also mentioned how people can develop esophagus cancer and other esophagus things. I mentioned to her that was smoking A lot in my past.

Tbh y’all I was smoking almost daily for a couple of years. Minimal breaks.  I stopped in 2017 for 9 months... longest time since I started almost regularly back in 2010.

I’ve been browsing this board and have notice people say things about their stomach problems when quitting. Could it be that? Im not sure. I sure hope so. I hope it’s not cancer. Mind you my best friend died 3 months ago from GIST (stomach cancer) and I remember I’m high school he mentioned having a lot of acid reflux ( also take in consideration he was bulimic back then)

A little bit about me:
I’m a 28yo Male that has been smoking weed heavily (2-3+ grams per day) for the past 12 years. I have never quit or stopped smoking weed for more than 7 days, and my use is daily from Late morning/Afternoon until late in the night. 
Regarding other substances Like, alcohol, I drink one beverage on 3-4 occasions per year, have no interest in the effects of alcohol, I find it obnoxious. Cigarettes, I smoked on and off for 8 years and have not smoked tobacco/nicotine in 4 years, quitting cigarettes was easy it just tastes like poison. 
Though even with success quitting cigarettes and not being a drinker, my attempts quitting weed over the years always fail abysmally. 

Let’s get into it:
I have been stuck for many months if not years now with a burning desire inside of me to quit smoking weed, which I say to myself on a daily basis. Though I never actually quit at least not fore long, The main underlying reason why I seem so intimidated and quite frankly scared shitless of quitting weed, is that every time I have in the last 12 years, after 3-4 days sober I begin to have EXTREMELY VIVID NIGHTMARES which usually wake me up multiple times throughout the night either very frightened, sweating or uncontrollably sad and upset. These NIGHTMARES happen every time and with undue certainty when I haven’t consumed marijuana. Additionally it is important to mention and note that when I smoke before sleeping it seems to prevent me from having ANY DREAMS, literally NONE! I have several friends that smoke most of which tell me they also do not dream if they smoke weed that day, and a few have recalled that when they have stopped for a few days or week that they begin to have or recall their dreams again, though none experienced NIGHTMARES like myself. Therefore I would assume something in weed is blocking the receptors/connections to either recall these dreams or they simply don’t happen, and we could, I believe go deeper to assume that I (we) may not be achieving REM sleep and/or not at an optimal level to have vivid dreams. The topic of dreams and more specifically in my case Nightmares and their correlation with marijuana is something that has been researched very very little if even at all and I seem to have only ever found one which was regarding the quality of sleep for marijuana smokers but nothing pertaining to dreams. 

This experience I have been living through during my attempts to quit has been what I believe is my main anchor keeping me smoking. I finally felt the need to sought out further discussion and insight, so coming across this reddit group has now given me this opportunity and I hope others the opportunity to discuss this topic further. At the end of the day I’m more curious to find out if this is a common thing in a certain percent of weed smokers and those that have experienced the withdrawals or if it’s just me... and if I’m maybe just on the edge of marijuana psychosis.

I continued to constantly be high throughout the entire summer into now, and I have been trying months to slow down or quit without much success.

Hey guys,

I'm thankful for this community, without it and uncommonforum, I would've had already lost it...

**HISTORY**

*Never had any depression or anxiety before smoking.*

I'm 26. I smoked for 5-6 years, basically every day. But took a lot of breaks, ranging from 1,2,3 months etc. My longest break was 6 month clean, this was my last and I got back into smoking when quarantine started. After 5 months or everyday use, I decided to quit again. 

*As you can see, I have a lot of experience with quitting (lul). But I never experienced any PAWS when I quit, withdrawal was always linear and even then very manageable after 2 weeks or so.*

*I used to quit after smoking way more than this time too. This period I would get really high from just a little so my tolerance and consumption definitely way lower than in the past.*

**The only different thing, which I think might be the cause for having PAWS this time and feeling like I lost my mind, might be that this time I bought a vaporizer, which was really good/strong and was using only that to vape dry herb. In the past only joints/bongs. So my theory is that during all the years, my body got kinda used to the burning of the weed and all the chemicals. Now, when I was vaping, I wasn't “calibrated” for it, maybe some chemicals which would be burned otherwise were getting into me...**

**QUITTING**

When I quit, I got one panic attack after 2 days, the next day pretty high anxiety, but got drunk at a party and it went away...this was all the withdrawal I got. 

Then, at 1 month clean, PAWS set in (hope it's “just” PAWS) and I got a full blown panic attack out of nowhere, while mountain biking. It lasted like 24 hours. I even called 911. I was convinced I'm on some drugs which I took by accident (really weird but panic convinced me this was the case). This panic attack only went away the next day after I took some medication to calm down. I never use this type of stuff and was anxious/sceptical about it, but it helped. But the panic continued the next day and the next and eventually I went to ER and then talked to psychiatrist...

From that day, it's been massive withdrawal with the usual symptoms : 
* panic attacks
* anxiety 
* depression
* fatigue
* insomnia (waking up after falling asleep)
* intrusive thoughts when falling asleep
* nausea
* dizziness
* stomach issues
* no appetite

This was really bad and lasted for week or so. Then it got better. Then got hit by another wave. Then better again etc.

Symptoms that I got on later waves:
* dissociation
* derealization/depersonalization
* brain fog
* zoning out all day
* anxiety attack after eating
* visual snow (only had it once i read about it...)
* feeling strange, not myself (like reality is different)
* feels like I'm tripping on something 
* phantom highs (when exercising or walking)
* health anxiety

I was actually getting better, less and less symptoms, anxiety went down etc. 

But the last 10 days or so (I'm on day 64) I got hit with massive brain fog, like I'm high all the time, but without the positive feeling. Can't concetrate, I'm like on auto-pilot. This comes with DP/DR. Feeling like reality is not real, or that it's strange. Like I'm in the dream. I go for a walk where I went 1000 times and it feels like I'm there for the first time. It doesn't even feel like traditional brain fog at this point, but some different kind of haze, hard to describe.

This dissociaton/derealization/depersonalization is causing my panic attacks for the most part. I'm doing something and suddenly it feels like I'm tripping or that I'm stopping to exist and I will get a panic attack. I know that DPDR should be the SYMPTOM of anxiety, but it's this cycle for me. Anxiety->DPDR->anxiety/panic attack.

I'm really scared because after 2 months I would never get any withdrawal. Now I feel like I'm going crazy. Don't want to go SSRI route...

Yesterday I got 2 panic attacks and in the evening I felt literally high (not brain fog high, but actually stoned with all the good/chill/fuzzy feeling). Had red and glassy eyes and I could smell weed from my sweat as well lul...This sweat smell happened like 2 weeks ago when I got hit with “muscle soreness/fatigue/feeling like fever” PAWS wave. 

Today I did intermitent fasting and felt a lot better, was productive around the house etc. But after I ate my first meal at 7pm I'm feeling high again, eyes even more red than yestreday (this doesn't bother me because again it feels like I literally smoked, it's not that fog/hazy/dark cloud over my head) I guess it would be a good thing because my body is flushing out THC, thus making me a little high? Maybe it's just placebo I don't know...

I should be moving to another country in 3 weeks (will be 3 months sober by then) cuz I found a job and I was actually really looking to moving and was happy about it, until PAWS/panic hit me. On one hand, it could be benefitial to clear my head in new city and country and be kept busy by work and everything new (even the psychiatrist thought so), but on the other hand, I don't know what I would do there with these symptoms...working every day/moving in a new place with strangers (I live alone now) and so on...

I'm basically not scared of the things themselves, but having panic attacks there, at at “inconvenient times” if you know what I mean.

I was looking forward to everything, but after that one panic attack that started my PAWS at 1 month sober, it feels like I've not been the same since. 

If someone read the whole thing it's amazing. Hopefully you can relate to this...Did someone experience panic attacks after 2 months sober?

I just need to know I will be okay. I already know this logically, because I read so much, but logic doesn't apply with anxiety/DPDR/panic attacks and these 3 things are the worst symptoms. It almost feels like the longer I'm sober the weirder I feel mentally. I'm getting desperate...

*TL;DR Smoker 5-6 years. Quit many times, never any serious withdrawal or paws. This time I'm fucked up after 2 months (day 64 today. PAWS started at 1 month with all the usual symptoms, but anxiety/panic attacks/DPDR is the worst right now and I'm really getting desperate at this point. It seems like the longer I go sober, the weirder I feel...*",7,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981980919837952}"

2020-10-16 12:51:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jcdhc3/1_year_clean_today/,1 year clean today,"Hi everyone,

I don’t really hang around here anymore, but wanted to leave some encouragement for those Just starting out on the journey. Today, I am 1 year totally clean from weed! And on the 27th, it’ll be one year totally clean from all mind-altering substances.  


A lot of great stuff has happened this year: I got a better job, and then left that job to freelance, which I’ve been doing since the summer and with much surprise at how well I’m doing. I am actually working toward my dreams, and doing what I came to New York (where I’m living) to do. Some days are more productive than others, but I have clarity now that I didn’t. I have drive and vision, and when something isn’t going the way I’d like it to, I’m able to take steps to put things on course rather than smoke away all of my problems for a few hours.  


By the end of my weed use, I was barely even getting high; it was more like numbing out. I’d smoke all day, every day when I’d smoke, often stealing my roommate’s stash. In retrospect, I was living in a complete fantasy. 

The first month or so was pretty tough. Suddenly, I had to face all of the things that I realized were making me miserable: my job, my living situation, and the feeling of being stuck. So I got a new job, moved out, and started to make real changes in my life. Within 6 months I was in an amazing new relationship (that I’m still in) with the best guy I’ve ever gone out with, and was just feeling like I was coming home to myself.  


Now, it’s sort of like autopilot. Sometimes I get tempted; my dad smokes, my current roommate smokes, and my BF occasionally does, but the temptations don’t last long because I remember how far I’ve come, how hard I’ve worked for this, AND how not fun smoking weed was in the end. Surely you guys can relate to that, right? It just wasn’t fun anymore— it was something to do. 

Things that helped, especially in the early days, were going to AA and NA meetings. I don’t go anymore, mainly because I work another 12 step program called ACA (Adult Children of Alcoholics/Dysfunctional Families) that gets to the root of why I‘m an addict in the first place, and grew frustrated with the people in AA/NA telling me that substances were the reason for all my woes. That said, hearing rooms full of people cheer when I told them my day count, or hearing stories that were deeply relatable, made me feel less alone— less damaged, less freaky. I still talk to a friend I made in NA, too.  


Generally, life feels more open, more full of possibility. I still feel the fog sometimes, which is WILD, but I have no regrets. I feel like I’ve made progress in my life, whereas when I was smoking it was like I was stagnant.

I have so much gratitude for all of you on this journey.   


After 4 Years of Daily Smoking, and one previous quit attempt that lasted 5 days, I have reached the 30-day milestone I once thought was a pipe dream. As many have shared before, it was not an easy undertaking.   


**Before Quitting, I gave away all my weed & paraphernalia to a friend and made him promise under no circumstance to give it back.  I also made the decision to pair quitting with meditating (20-40 minutes) daily** to ease the transition and documented  some observations week by week:   


* **Week 1**   
Dreams are Vivid and vary from nightmarish to euphoric. Sleep is irregular. Irritability and Smoke Cravings are High. Emotions & Mood Swings happen throughout the day. Boredom is INTENSE. Meditation helps as a reset button but the positive effect is temporary. Concentration takes soooo much effort. 
* **Week 2**   
Withdrawal symptoms are the same as week 1 but 50% less severe. Mental space to start exploring hobbies. Reading, Nature Walks & Meditation are the most helpful in creating a healthy headspace. Near the end of Week 2, I gain confidence that I never need marijuana again and start to experience a ""quitting high"" 
* **Week 3**   
""Quitting High"" Dissipates in the middle of the week, and the desire for altered states of consciousness & dopamine is at an all-time high. I relapse on my No Fap Streak of 7 months. Boredom feels more INTENSE than ever. Hobbies start losing some of their appeals. Emotionally and Psychologically this week was just as challenging as week 1. 
* **Week 4**   
Mental & Emotional Clarity feels achievable every day with minimum to moderate effort. Random bout of happiness begin occurring throughout the day. Cravings are at an all-time low. I stop tracking my streak days, and I am surprised when I check to see I made it to the 30-day mark. This week has felt the lightest in terms of effort. I am able to concentrate routinely and my life feels like it's flowing in a natural rhythm. Accomplishing tasks gives me a sense of satisfaction that feels more REAL than it ever felt in my years of smoking. 

**Take-Aways:** 

**- Getting Out Of the Usual Environment once a day (In Nature preferably) is a gamechanger.** 

**- Daily Gratitude & Meditation Practice is essential. (Insight Timer is a GREAT MEDITATION APP)**

**- The ""Quitting High"" is So Real and Like Any High was Temporary**   
**- Giving away  All weed + paraphernalia to a friend was a great accountability check, and was crucial in making this quit attempt stick, unlike my previous attempt.** 

  
I wish the best to all of you at all/any stages of your journey. There is true strength in Numbers, and we are Stronger Together.

On top of all of that, I was hitting my vape a lot throughout the day. I've just generally been abusing my lungs for about 4 years and it kind of escalated in the last year. I've been trying to sweat hard every day and excersize, it's definitely been doing me good, but every time I get out there and start running my chest starts to hurt and ache. It feels like a stomach cramp that you'd get while running, but it's in my chest area, behind my sternum and spread to both sides of my chest, where my lungs are. Now I hear stories about people who hack up tar and shit from their lungs after they stop, that's never happened to me, but I'm just wondering if anyone out there maybe abused their lungs like I have, and if their chest pain ever went away.

Just wanna say that after being a long time lurker I want to share my experience thus far, because reading everyone else’s has helped me more than I thought imaginable.

I took me a while to admit that I was addicted, or even dependent, as that word seems to carry no meaning among pot smokers because it’s “not addictive”. Been smoking since I was 16 and I used it for both recreation and a coping mechanism for a lot of issues I didn’t know how to deal with. But knowing that it takes away my motivation and makes me complacent I decided to make a deal with my dad instead of myself, because for me knowing that I let someone else down hurts more than letting myself down. 

Deal was that I would stop smoking until I get a job, and I’m recruiting in finance right now with things going moderately well, a third round interview on the way, I honestly think this might be my way out of kush entirely, and it feels great! For me the hardest part was admitting that it was a problem, and then how to really dedicate myself to not smoking because it really is so easy nowadays. A lot of your experiences have helped me realize where I was and what steps I could take to break out, so really thank you everyone. I don’t know where I’d be without this sub bringing me back to reality. Love y’all",1,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9933714866638184}"

Looking back now I understand why my high felt so awful. I was in a constant state of worry regarding my future, career, money etc. 
The high made me worry even more, it amplified my baseline mindset and this resulted in a very negative experience for me. 
Fast forward to today. I have taken quite some steps to change my worldview to more relaxed and accepting state of mind. Workouts, meditation, tai chi and yoga helped me a lot during this process to align myself with what is and what I want out of life. 
So I am now at a point where I can enjoy smoking weed again and that's quite relaxing aswell. Anyway I still only do it occasionally because the daily use is just of no benefit from my point of view.

Slowly, slowly the purchasing of paraphernalia started entering my life as I continued to smoke out with friends having a good time. But as time passed, and friends moved on, smoking at my house became a method of coping with my loneliness,  long story short, I smoked weed practically every day, for the past 3 years of my life. I am now 20 and realise that I have missed out on a fuck tonne of fun experiences due to wanting to stay home and smoke (along with my gambling addiction). 9 days clean, withdrawals have been pretty bad, with interrupted sleep and scary dreams almost being a nightly occurrence.

It became too much, I craved nothing else and wasted my life away thiking about weed, smoking weed and during the last year, after lighting up inevitably regretting it and telling myself I would stop. One day after flunking 3 difficult classes and having to take them again I finally told myself that that was it and quit cold turkey. Have not looked back since.

It has been 13 months now and I have changed my life a fair bit. Started working out every other day, quit alcohol abuse and realised there is more to living, mainly due to being stuck in quarantine for better part of half a year haha. Lately, I have been thinking about having a chill day once in a while, just lay back, go to a friend's house, light a joint and play chess, some league of legends, kick back and just relax. 

I think my view on weed changed and I can restrain myself from the bad usage and just enjoy it once in a while, however, I am still talking about ending a 13 month streak, so am a bit unsure...
 
Would love some thoughts on it, what do you think? Is there anyone with similar story and experience?


UPDATE:

Hi, I thought I would give an update, and share what I learned - in the end, I did not smoke, however I still had a bit of marijuana. My sister offhandedly mentioned that there were some cannabis edibles in the freezer the day after I made the post and I thought to myself that edibles were the ideal way for me to 'scratch the itch'. It went... okay, I enjoyed it for a bit, then after an hour or two all the unpleasant emotions and anxiety came back in just the right amount for me to realise that I won't smoke, probably ever again. 

It was an interesting experience and one I'm glad I went for, since if I had not had edibles then, I'm positive the thought of cannabis would have gnawed on my mind until I somehow succumbed to it. I feel the need to really stress the difference the fact that I had edibles and didn't smoke make! I did not feel like I was failing myself or the 13 month streak of not smoking, it was a much needed part of the process instead of a mistake. I'm not entirely sure if this would work for a majority of ppl in this way, but if one finds themselves in a bind as I did, having some edibles to remind themselves that weed really is not worth it might be the solution.

One more thing I would like to point out is that the final decision I made 14 months ago to stop smoking and the motivation behind it is what made this recent experience of mine a success. When I finally quit smoking, it was not an unpleasant, internally tumultuous or outright mentally violent affair. It was something I gravitated towards for a few months, however unsuccessfuly, and when the time finally came, I stopped without ever having any cravings or experiencing any sort of a withdrawal. I feel like it is what made it possible for me to try the edibles now and not return to smoking. I just let go of weed and did not have to convince myself, I was just sort of done with it. 

In the end everyone needs to be truthful to themselves and must find the strength to face what they feel inside of them. I think 90% of the time, the brain is just playing tricks on us with thoughts of smoking again and the outcome would be a disaster. I would strongly recommend not smoking, it just is not worth it, plain and simple, if however one finds themselves in the right circumstances, a small enough reminder in the form of a cannabis cookie might help them in the long run. Remembering the waves of anxiety made me swear off smoking marijuana for good, and I am better for it.",1,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9458034634590149}"

I could NOT have done it without reading and responding to this community.  From the bottom of my heart, I thank you and love you all. 

I didn't want to quit weed, nor did I want to start. I was 27 when I had my first puff and now I'm 39 with one year clean. I never smoked an obscene amount. But what I did smoke was enough to affect my personality and mental health. I quit by seer accident; the regular weed shop in my hood closed and it was very cold/rainy for a while so I was too lazy to buy more. Also, I had recently quit booze and thought maybe I'd see how long I could be fully sober (excluding espresso, praise the Dark Lord). 

Anyway, as the weeks turned into months there was never a moment I felt sure of my decision.  I was conflicted. On one hand I was noticing emotional, mental, and physical changes in my new cleaner self. I was no longer uncontrollably anxious, I had less stomach aches, less physical pains, and I was able to construct a new emotional image of my self, and yes DREAMS!! Very vivid and wonderful dreams. But I had bouts of anger, bordering on rage. I was very sad, felt lost, and depressed. It felt like all the emotions I had suppressed suddenly came back and my brain was trying to process everything.   I wanted so badly to just smoke again, and there were a few close calls. But thanks to this sub, working out, running, jerking off (meh, might as well be honest) and the unwavering curiosity of ""what would it feel like to get to a year?"" I stayed on the path.

After 1 year, I can see that weed was partly responsible for slowing my maturity and the growth of my self-worth. But also I'm still me. I'm still fucked. I'm still silly. I'm still working on my shit. I'm still curious about my hobbies. It was never the weed that was causing the deeper issues. It was me. I'm responsible for my well being, my mental health, my emotional strength.  The only thing weed did was numb me to forward motion. It made me anaesthetized to the potential of growth I had all along.  I can't say I won't smoke again either, I can't say quitting is the best thing for everyone. But if you're sitting there wondering who else you could be, what else is inside you waiting to grow.  If you're ready to try a new character trait feed that hunger, plant that seed, believe in that future.

I have been stuck in the cycle of trying to quit for ~2 years now, never making it more than a few days, and one of the hardest parts has always been my lack of appetite. I'm a few days in now and faring better than usual, so I thought I'd share two things that have helped:

Number 1 piece of advice you'll hear from almost everybody is ""exercise to build up an appetite"", and that certainly works. But another approach I don't see mentioned much is getting mentally exhausted rather than physically exhausted. I'm not sure if this is a psychological trick or if there's some biological basis to it, but I've noticed that I get hungry from things that are mentally demanding and require focus. I can watch TV or browse the internet for hours without eating anything, but 10 minutes of trying to learn a new song on the guitar and I need a snack break.

The second thing that has helped is embracing Matt Might's advice of ""optimizing transaction costs"". Basically, structure your environment in a way that minimizes barriers to productive behavior. The whole article (and blog) is worth a read, but his anecdote about the pull-up bar summarizes it very well:

> In my first year as a new professor, I wanted to start doing pull-ups, so I attached a portable pull-up bar to the door outside our bedroom. Every time I passed by, the transaction cost of a pull-up was near zero, so I did some pull-ups. Moreover, I didn't have to remember to do pull-ups, because I saw the pull-up bar all the time. One day (for reasons unknown) the bar was taken down and placed on the floor. The bar lay on the floor for months, and I didn't do another pull-up for years. It would haven taken about ten seconds to re-install the bar, but I was often in a rush, and that ten seconds had become a transaction cost.

For eating, the transaction costs are ""ugh, I just don't feel like eating right now"", or ""I don't want to prep/cleanup"".  Here is how I have been working around those:

* I am leaning on comfort foods pretty heavily - my goals are ""eat enough"" and ""eat healthy"", in that order. Currently that means eating frozen pizza for dinner several times per week, because no matter how unhungry I am, I can usually force a few hundred calories of pizza down my gullet. I have also been getting Chipotle a lot more than I usually would. An unfortunate downside to this is that I've accepted I'm going to be spending more on food in the near future.

* I have also found it pretty easy to force down Soylent (meal-in-a-bottle) when I have 0 appetite. I showed the bottle to my therapist who specializes in nutrition, and he said that the ingredients all looked fine/healthy (as long as it is used to supplement real food that you're eating, not replace it altogether).

* I have had some success with meal prepping too. Once you get over the big initial transaction cost, it's just a matter of reheating frozen food. Although, if you don't cook much, you might not know what to make, so ""choosing a dish"" becomes another transaction cost. IMO a good choice is lentil curry - healthy, tasty, options for variety, and easy to add something like chicken breast to it.

I hope this is helpful, since I see people on this sub talking about the same issues I have with not being able to eat enough.",1,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.929503858089447}"

My boyfriend and I have been together almost a year. I am pretty sexual and he really isn’t, but we still have a pretty good sex life. We’ve figured out how to meet in the middle. But sex has been the only one real issue we’ve had. Everything else is incredible with us. 

The problem though is he gets reallyyyy in the mood when he’s high with his friends. Like texting me and calling me and saying stuff that he never does sober. And I LOVE it. I want to reap the benefits of his high but he refuses to get high around me (rightfully so because the last time he did, I relapsed).

It feels like a cruel joke from the universe that the one problem I have with the love of my life can be fixed by the biggest problem I’ve ever had in my life. Ugh. And now I can’t stop thinking of ways to try and convince him to get high around me. And since he called me earlier high AF I can’t stop thinking about weed. I haven’t fixated on it like this in months. It’s just a slippery slope I already feel myself on. 

Anyway, if anyone has any words of wisdom or kindness or anything to share at all, i would much appreciate it. 🙏🏽

I realised I was smoking to keep a lot of subconscious impulses and emotions buried. The past week has been up and down. Last night was particularly difficult.

My friends have been incredible. After smoking everyday for about 5 years I truly didn't believe I could just stop. But now, I don't want to smoke. I know I won't feel better after. And I know I'll just be more ashamed. Without weed, my social anxiety is 10% of what it used to be. I can conversate with my bosses with no problem. 

Don't wanna get too personal but I've also cut out porn and jerking off. 

Overall, I feel so much clearer, full of energy.

My mornings are amazing. I wake up 1 sleep cycle before my alarm almost every morning, and when I go back to sleep I'm met with extremely vivid dreams. I've been able to turn them into lucid dreams most mornings.

I struggled with taking a couple shots of alcohol here and there over the week. But I'm not going to replace my weed addiction with an even worse habit. When I drink, I feel good for about 30 minutes. After, I get depressed because I feel like I can't deal with my emotions by myself.

Overall, I feel I've learned to turn to others for help a lot more. Before, I used to bottle stuff up and use weed to ""deal with it"".

My adhd meds feel like they work better every day. I don't feel like I'm in a constant fog. 

I want to keep going. I don't want to smoke again. I love the dreams. I love the clarity. I want to keep my smoking to a weekly thing with my buddy when he comes over. I'm never smoking by myself again.

Just wanted to say. If you're struggling, if you don't believe in yourself, if you constantly get set back.. Turn to people for support. it's okay to be distracted. Especially for the first few weeks. Withdrawals are real and you need to overwrite your impulses. 

I'm writing this because I'm proud– but also because I want to stick to it. I feel writing this adds extra accountability. 

Sure, there's downsides. I feel like life is a lot less magical every day. But I realise that I don't *need* weed to wind down. Breathing exercises, limited blue light, healthy food, all help immensely. And I feel like my true self is coming out again. The self that I tried to mute for so long. I am naturally a very hyper person. I have a chaotic mind. But as long as I embrace that, I feel confident in my skin. 

I won't give up. I will be strong. And I know you guys can be too. I love that there's a community for this.

But, here’s a lil list of my symptoms 
1. Health Anxiety, i’ve felt not great for a month (had been smoking less and less) and have convinced myself i have rabies :) 
went to ER 2 times, doctor office, blood tests which all came back normal, prescribed anxiety medicine, referred to a therapist, and going to a Gastroenterologist to see why i’m swallowing so much air. 

2. neck pains, have been swallowing air. (i also have a lot of phlegm, probably lungs trying to heal, but i vape, trying to wain off slowly, just can’t do cold turkey with everything else going on rn)  Back pains, general muscle pains in my arms
3. My hands have been feeling weird, just like. i can grab things but sometimes i just go for it wrong or it just feels, weird. can’t explain it. 
4. really bloated, but it’s been getting better somewhat, i’m also underweight (96pounds 5’2 Female) but i was 93 when i started so, have been gaining! 
Had waves of anxiety last night, panicked for a few minutes, cried, calmed down but, still not feeling the best today from it, worse than the usual pains, just anxious. (i’m still convinced i have rabies in the back of my head lol)
But i am doing better than the mess i was 8 days ago. This stuff is scary but, taking it day by day, drawing, watching youtube, light exercise because anytime i do anything simple i get winded and feel so tired.

2020-10-15 09:58:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jbo1c7/addiction_and_deeper_issues/,Addiction and “Deeper Issues”,"When I first talked with my therapist about weed addiction (I live in a medical state and have a card), she said she thinks I have “other issues” and that weed is not addictive. Now, the weed not being addictive part is something most people here including myself would disagree with to an extent. It’s not comparable to alcohol, heroine, prescription pain killers, etc but it has its own dangers. A few weeks later I gave her more details on my relationship with weed and she conceded that some people can display addictive behavior with it but she didn’t think I fell under that category at first.

However, the deeper issues part has truth to it. Why do I not feel comfortable in my own sober head?

We went on to cover a host of family issues which wasn’t anything new for me. We also started talking about my romantic life (ding, ding, ding!). I am 28M and I have been involuntarily single for 2 and a half years. My last gf cheated on me, lied through her teeth our whole relationship, and gas lit me when I was suspicious of her cheating. 

Before that I was doing really bad at dating apps. Like I would run out of people to swipe and not have a match. I even would pay to see if people “liked” me and I didn’t get a single like for the last month I was on. This has been an issue for me since I was 20. It completely rocked my confidence.

Here’s the thing, I’m not short (btw short guys, there are plenty of girls who don’t care), I work out regularly, I practice mixed martial arts, I genuinely think I’m a catch.

So, my therapist says she wants me to try dating apps again. I protested and told her that she does not understand. I said it has been a deep source of depression for me and I was afraid I would end up even more depressed.

I download coffee meets bagel. I spend three days on it and it’s the same old story. I then went to FB dating - same. So, now I am getting stoned just to get on these apps and not feel like dog shit. Finally I download Hinge. And wow...like wow, wow. 

I’m not sure exactly what it is. I think partly they encourage men to write more on their profiles which helps. And partly maybe I finally got my pictures right. Regardless, I don’t even have time to talk to all my matches on there. I am still floored by it. And these matches are stunning, interesting girls. One girl was so hot I wanted to tell her she should stop talking to me and date an OKC Thunder player or some shit. And she was almost through school to be a vet which makes her even more of a package.

Tomorrow I am going on a date and I have a good feeling about it. So, long story short, dating apps destroyed my previously rock solid confidence with ladies and said confidence stayed destroyed for 8 years. (And wouldn’t ya know that’s about how long I have been smoking)

Yesterday I was pondering this pretty hard. It encouraged me to not smoke my usual evening jay and now I am sitting here pretty damn close to 24 hours sober. You know what? I finally don’t really want it. I would rather be sober today and be better at literally everything. When I want to smoke I can play Modern Warfare and see real, numeric evidence that I am playing 4x as well.

I encourage everyone on this sub to not give up on their “deeper issues.” In fact, work on them while u r stoned. I did for several months. I just stopped thinking about my smoking and started being productive to read self help books, journal, work out, etc. I hope this helps someone.

By day 4 I also couldn’t sleep till 5 am I was just not tired. I got chills and felt sweaty when it was cold in my room. My palms and feet were the ones that were always sweaty.

My habit the last few years were about a half gram of concentrate everyday if I tried to be conservative(sometimes a gram), I would always wake up at 6am and would take a fat glob of wax to put me back to sleep so I basically started smoking heavily at 6am every day.

Honestly I think I provided my own answer, the human body holds onto phyto-cannabinoïds very long, and can even reïntroduce them into the bloodstream from fats in the body.

Came back in my country six months later, jobless, smoked a bit, stopped again, etc. Overall, between january 2018 and april 2020, I probably didn't smoke 80% of my time, which is good.

I knew I could not do that all my life. It was counter productive and coming back from those weekends was so hard. 

During the lockdown in march, I lost it. I bought 150 euros of weed and smoked like hell during the first three weeks. In the morning, afternoon while working from home. Eating shit. On april 15, I finished the weed and decided I could not do that anymore. 

I nearly smoked in july this summer. I was staying with 3 of my best friends in another city, I was drunk af. One of them was smoking and he offered me some.

Since yesterday, my use of cigarettes has increased which is probably expected behaviour but that sort of smoke just doesn’t cut it. 

I didn’t manage to eat any food nor did I have the urge to get myself something simple as a drink of water.  Thirst and hunger were non existent last night but all I could concentrate on was being able to sleep, worrying whether I’m going to get enough hours rest for me to carry on my normal, working day the next. 

I managed to fall asleep but in a very, very light state. A lot of moving around in the night with excessive amounts of sweat throughout the night (which I expected) but not to that extent. I woke up at 5:30am as if I had about 2 hours sleep but it felt like I had a lot longer. 

My first few hours at work were rough but it was tolerable and I was quite surprised on how “social” I was towards my colleagues. I really thought I would’ve been in a serious, down mood all day but it really was the opposite, until I clocked off work and the “Weed urge” creeped up on me. 

I managed to get past that urge after work and as soon as I arrived home, I actually built up the “slightest” appetite so I took that opportunity and managed to have some food. It wasn’t a great amount but I felt like it was enough. 

I’m still getting cold and hot sweats, throughout the day and night but I know that these are passable symptoms. I’ve took myself by surprise by how I’m managing to tell myself that this will not last forever. 

I actually laughed today, multiple times at a variety of comedy and I haven’t experienced that emotion for years, where I have genuinely found something funny. I think it proves that Weed really does suppress certain emotions (Doesn’t impact everybody the same, I understand) and I really enjoyed the feeling of laughing, genuinely, let alone being sober. 

Tonight is “Day 2” for me & I’m going to treat myself to a film of Comedy,  maybe 2 if I decide to take part in #TeamNoSleep 😂 but it really is the best coping mechanism for me at the moment. (If anybody has any recommendations, either Prime Video or Netflix, that’d be great!) 

So that’s my day & I hope everybody is keeping well and steady sailing.

My urge to think about cannabis is almost never there which is good, the vivid dreams are not frequent anymore, sweating overall has diminished quite a lot, I feel like I have moved on and enjoying and embracing sober life everyday. It’s nice to live in this newly created sober world. 

I do read in my 12 step book before sleep, “just for today” and sometimes mixed with war story’s from NA 12 step book or a guided meditation, it helps my peace of mind, and remember where I come from!

It’s like every week that passes, the more balanced I become.

It's because it doesn't give me a hangover, it doesn't impair me so much that I'm falling down trying to walk. Its effects are mild for the most part and that's what makes it sinister in a sense. It started off with me getting a bag here and there and enjoying it with friends. It's was a lot of fun. It seemed to make movies and games and food seem so much more enjoyable. And then it begins. Slowly, I craved it more and more. I started smoking alone. I started to need it. Instead of something I did to enhance my experiences I was smoking right after waking up all throughout the day, if I had the chance. It became less of a fun thing to do to something I felt I NEEDED to do just to feel normal. It was all I looked forward to after a long stressful day. I  needed it to be able to eat, to be able to sleep, to be able to derive pleasure from ANYTHING. It slowly consumed my life, my time, my extra spending money. I started neglecting my hobbies and friends and responsibilities. Just sitting there baked out of my gourd laughing at YouTube videos or movies was enough to satisfy me, but I wasn't living my life to its potential.

A lot of it is because it isn't an overnight thing, it happens so slowly that it's really hard to notice what it's doing to you. Again, this isn't the case for everyone. Some people can drink a single beer and be fine. Some people can eat a single cookie and then put them away. Some people can have surgery and take their pain medicine as prescribed and when they're better, throw the rest away. But for a person with addictive tendencies like myself, weed took over my life but I'm not ashamed of it. It was a long learning experience that I've grown from and came out the other side as a stronger version of myself. 

There are 150k members here, because at its core, weed is actually much more addictive than many would like to admit, based on my experiences both living it and reading others' struggles here as well. I'm so glad to have it out of my life, this time for good. Thanks for reading my long-winded rant. Good luck to everyone on their journey, it's worth it.

My boyfriend smokes and he’s Supportive of me quitting but he still smokes and that’s a big trigger for me. 
He doesn’t smoke near me but every day that I tell myself I’m not going to smoke and then I know he’s rolling I forget why I wanted to stop. Reading everyone’s journey here is definitely motivating me. Yesterday we finished what we had left so today I’m feeling motivated that I won’t smoke because I don’t have any but I am really scared of how I’m going to feel when I go to bed tonight and I know I can’t smoke but I think that’s the best way because obviously I don’t have any self-control right now.",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.923738420009613}"

I quit smoking flower a few weeks ago and just mainly smoked dabs. reason? the action of doing a dab is more tedious and annoys me, thus correlating a more negative tone with the maryjane. 

Whats making this hard is that I have adhd and I think leaving the stoner squad would be beneficial. Even though it has ' helped ' me over the last few years, ex: with encouraging me to get out of bed and eat, focus on projects, and talk to people, I am realizing it's just a coping mechanism for unfavorable situations or a forced stimulant for my low-dopamine brain. 

My boyfriend is getting whiplash from my reactions to stimulation or lack-thereof and I was wondering if anyone (with adhd or not) has any coping advice for the mood swings and the anger? I also have an overwhelming feeling that I should/could be doing something productive while sober and I find myself getting easily irritated about being bored. Those last two may be because of the ADHD though haha

On the bright side, other than the mood swings, I feel quite clear-headed, focused and can maintain several individual different thoughts and can even recall them after a few minutes, as opposed to them drifting off and coming back hours-days-months later! I also really enjoy that I can give people 100% of my attention.

I'm 23 years old. I can't say I've wasted all of my time in the last 9 years. It's started off as an enjoyable experience and a way to make friends. But it soon turned into an addiction, and something I've wanted to be rid of for years.   


I REFUSE to grow up and spend the rest of my life smoking weed. I REFUSE to be that guy. I hate who I've become smoking weed. It's so easy for me to be content with being a loser when I smoke weed all day every day.  


I thank God that all of this pain has helped me realize that 100% sober really is the only way for me.   


I have no job, I smoke weed all day every day, I'm a complete loser. Anyone who lives like I do and calls themselves successful is delusional. This has GOT TO CHANGE. It hurts too much.  


Just wondering if there are any Christian men on here I might be able to talk with. I need help moving towards sobriety. I've done it so many times and failed. Attempting to quit in itself is a painful experience that brings up many past failures.  


But I do believe that a REAL relationship with Jesus Christ is my only hope to ever quit. Granted, I think I do have to make an effort. Something I've been a stranger to for a while.  


Please comment if you're down to talk. Even if you aren't necessarily a Christian. I just need to talk to some people who have some time sober. Preferably at least 30 days sober from everything. If you're not trying to go the 100% sober route, talking might not be that beneficial.

When I was in the early stages I really appreciated when people would share their experiences in respect to their timelines. I'll share my experiences over the last four months, of course your milage may (and probably will) vary:  
**Week 1 and 2:**  
\- Lots of thoughts of smoking weed  
\- Sleep was possible but not very restful. Hard to get to sleep and hard to stay sleeping. Woke up early. Jumpy legs and unrelaxed body  
\- Anxiety was high, it wasn't easy to achieve a relaxed state. I took a lot of hot baths (which I almost never do otherwise). Not sure why, but it really seemed to help.   
\- Lots of sweating  
\- Depressed and low mood. Hard to motivate myself to do much so I didn't really do a lot.  
\- Productivity at work suffered  
\- Almost no appetite  
\- Mood unstable, controllable but present anger and short temper  
\- Focused almost soley on getting clean and that I was a weed smoker anymore

**Week 3 and 4:**  
\- Things started to get better here, my thoughts about weed were still there, but fewer and less compelling  
\- Sleep started to become a bit easier, sometimes I could get a restful sleep.  
\- Anxiety and depression still present but not as severe. It was easier to get through the days now.   
\- I felt better and more alive when I'd wake up in the morning  
\- My outlook on life in general started to improve, I started to feel some improvements and this helped motivate me to keep going  
\- Started focusing on healing, taking up new hobbies and trying to intentionally make improvements in areas of my life such as relationships and my job/career.  
\- Mood started to stabilize  
\- Started to get a little more involved in my life again instead of focusing almost entirely inward.

**Month 2:**  
\- Sleep was still affected but definitely not nearly as bad as before. I was started to get some good nights of sleep in and it felt great  
\- Thoughts about weed were slowing down. Sometimes I'd be caught off guard by this as I hadn't thought about it for a better portion of the day and suddenly the addicted part of my brain is reminding me its time to smoke.  
\- Appetite was back to normal. It was strange experiencing natural hunger actually. I like to fast for 12 hours or so everyday and it was a bit harder to do that I found.  
\- My mood was better, I was easier to live with and more predictable. Anxiety wasn't nearly as bad and depression would come and go. My motivation for life was slowly returning but sometimes my ambition was still pretty low. 

**Month 3:**  
\- This is where things really started to improve. Mood was become more ""normal"" and thoughts of weed were few and far between. Cravings were now quite minimal and easily dismissed.   
\- Sleep continued to improve. Most nights now I can sleep through the night without interuption.  
\- Zest for life starting to return. Starting to feel emotions a little more and starting to get excited about ""normal"" things. Getting to the point where I'd feel ""good"" in general like I would have before when stoned (my old normal).

**Month 4:**  
\- Improvements continue. I know this'll take some time to fully heal from but I really feel like I'm out of the woods so to speak, and I think my progress from here will be very slow and gradual.   
\- Mood is the most stable it has been since... well - forever.  
\- Sleep is pretty good minus my bad habit of going down youtube rabbit holes before I go to bed.  
\- Zest for life continuing to step up. Excited about whats going on in my life and more attentive to all areas of my life. Much more mind space for everything important.  
\- Cravings, while not at zero are few and far between and barley have any pull. I've conditioned myself to not want weed because I do not want that old life. I'm ready to live the rest of my days as a sober person and that doesn't scare me as much. Its just not a part of my life anymore.  
\- My cognative abilities have improved so much. My memory is sharper and I'm way more organized. I can solve problems with more confidence than before.  
\- Its easier for me to separate the cause of any issues in my life, what was caused by weed and what was just a flaw in my character or general bad habit. I don't blame everything on weed, I'm accountable for my actions and don't push the blame on a substance anymore.  
\- My happiness level and feeling of purpose is better than ever  


I didn't expect that my life would just be a breeze with zero problems and a constant feeling of happiness without weed. Its still life and sometimes things still suck like life events that are just going to suck anyway. It's okay though, I know that I can deal with it without weed. I'm focused on becoming a better person to those around me.

Every negative feeling i feel i automatically blame it on these self diagnoses, this is making it extremely hard to go about my normal life, im worried that this panic is making me think that i have symptoms when i really dont and to be honest with you, i have no fucking idea if there's anything wrong with me or not and i think that's what makes it so scary. I just wanna feel normal again.

Im wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience to this, if so please leave a comment, i would love to hear from you. I know that this sounds very confusing and messy but trust me i am just as confused as you. Please feel free to ask questions.

Will i feel better once i've been sober for a while? Is all of this because of weed?  Will i ever stop being afraid of the unknown and possibly untrue?

Hey Reddit users, this may be a long post but I would appreciate it if you read it, this is my first time using this app, I’m making this post because I can’t find any posts relating to this so maybe somebody can relate or have insight, (and no it’s not covid I did the test twice because people were assuming my health problems were a covid thing and both came out negative),

I was a heavy chain smoker with backwoods (blunts) for 5-6 years, smoking about 10-12 blunts a day. I know it’s excessive but I was addicted and didn’t even know it, I was eating 1-2 nice meals a day and drinking water normally. For my last year of smoking I started mixing this tobacco leaf with my weed in the blunt (Grabba) it’s a really strong Jamaican leaf, I would heat up the leaf and crush a lot of it into my weed and roll it up into a blunt which is basically smoking double tobacco / nicotine and would smoke my 10-12 blunts my chest would feel tight but no health symptoms.

July 8th, 2020 I was smoking my blunts and my heart had a palpitation (felt like it skipped a beat) and I’ve never felt that before and the left side of my chest started really hurting, my whole body felt like it shut down and I thought I was going to faint. I’ve never felt like that before. My heart started rapidly beating 24-7 so hard that I always felt it, and my chest was so tight I didn’t know what was going on. I went to the hospital and got myself checked out and they couldn’t find anything saying my EKG, Bloodwork test, X - rays show nothing, I’ve seen countless cardiologist and some stress tests (running on a treadmill for 15 minutes) and did a small breathing test with a lung doctor but they say my breathing test came out fine.

I quit smoking weed since my first episode (3 months ago) It’s now October 14th so a whole 3 months have passed, and I’ve made a slow recovery to my heart palpitations, I don’t feel my heart beating 24-7 anymore , it comes randomly only for a short period of time maybe once every 2-3 days, but last month in September I started getting breathing issues, my chest still feels very tight everyday, and I have difficulty breathing all day, I have chest tightness and difficulty breathing, my doctor gave me a puffer to see if it relieves my breathing it helps a bit but I’m still having trouble breathing, it’s been 3 months from my first episode I quit smoking weed and blunts all together, I started eating 2-3 meals a day and drinking more water and I starting working out weight resistance and I do 30 minutes of cardio everyday, my question is will I ever get my breathing to get back to normal, will my chest tightness go away, will I stop having these weird issues with my body? Any help would be ok. I’ve seen countless cardiologist, lung specialist, and have been to the ER about 13 times these past 3 months but they no one can find anything to the point the hospital is getting tired of seeing me saying why are you even coming back.

Doctors want to put labels and say I have bipolar disorder but imo that’s because they have a single lense into a multidimensional world.

When I first quit, I had realized weed was just making me more impulsive, unbearably overstimulated, and avoidant. I thought stopping would let me live peacefully after withdrawal ended. For me, the purpose of life (ik corny) is really just to live and be yourself and I was not prepared to accept all that I am. I realize I was not living when I was smoking because I was just suppressing who I am with weed and avoiding acceptance. I tried countless meds from psychiatrists for my “illness,” but they really just tried to “correct” me to some unrealistic and biased idea of what most people should think, feel, and behave like. Unfortunately, buying into the fundamental assumptions of chronic mental disorders and treatments was actually just keeping me miserable by the way I was thinking about myself and my qualities and it was very corrosive for me. 

I wanted to escape chronic physical pain, escape the emotional mismatch from trying to think, feel, and behave some way I am not built to, and escape the consequences of choosing the wrong things for the wrong reasons. Now that I have stopped smoking and trying to chemically be and feel...well, not me, I am learning to embrace all parts of myself. Even my impulsiveness was useful when I learned from it.

I can proudly say I am sensitive both physically and emotionally and that is my superpower, I have moods that afford me unique perspectives even with certain costs and that’s my wisdom, and I am decisive and can live with the consequences and that is my peace of mind.

Today marks 60 days without weed and I couldn’t be more excited to be on this journey of sobriety and of  living as who I am.

I was offered a joint with some friends about 3 weeks ago and boy did that ruin the progress. 

It is not my friends fault- I said yes. I don’t know why. I’d been so good at saying no and just accepting it but for some reason I thought if I can do 7 months I can have one high night with my friends. 

Well, clearly I have an addictive personality because ever since then I have continuously purchased joints and have been smoking. I tell myself that I have found a routine for it because I manage to work all day, come home and workout then only smoking at the very end of my day. 

It’s great that I manage to hold off but I still want to get this addiction out of my system. 

My question would be, can someone please explain to me why my weird/annoying addict mind is telling myself that I have somehow managed to productively re introduce this back into my life? Because I haven’t lol. I might hold off until I’m done work and have worked out but you better believe all I think about is how excited I am to smoke when I’m working or working out. 

Man I feel like a failure but I really just don’t know where to start again. And I don’t want anyone to be negative please, it really disappoints me but the addiction has resurfaced and I need help to beat it again. Before when I quit it was during covid, I didn’t have anywhere to get it and I stuck at home and scared to even go and “pick up” plus I was unemployed. Now it’s a different ball game: I have a dispensary in my city, it’s COVID safe, affordable and I’m working full time making good money. So all of my things that helped push me to quit before are gone. Any advice would be so very appreciated.

I have been a daily smoker (primarily hash and tobacco in joints) for about a year and a half. Coincidently this is also the the same ammount of time ive been living with me three best friends in an appartment. Before that we used to meet late at night to smoke together. It was ofcourse an initial relase that we didnt have to worry about what our surroundings thought of us being high. The ground-rule has from the get go been, that we do not smoke indoor or on the terrace. Thats ofcourse not an issue since we have alot of recreational parks in the surrounding area. There have been alot of key changes through these to years. At first we shared our weed (we purcased together and smoked together). At some point we started having everything for ourselves.  Corona only made everything worse. I tried to stop for a few weeks, but it didnt really help - as I only immediatly returned to my previous level of smoking. So here I am - Today is the day. I have come to hate being high, more than being sober. The problem is that it is immensly hard to resist the urge to get high, when my roomies are still smoking as there is no tommorow. I really want to get better, but I find it really difficult not getting tempted. Anybody with experience with this situation

I started in my 3rd year of college when my roommate introduced me to weed. Since then I've had both ups and extremely low downs with it. On one hand it helped introduced me to my best friends, helped immensely with my depression, and is very much associated with the first person I fell in love with. On the other, it tanked my grades, made me abandon my honors thesis, caused unprofessional behavior across several jobs/ volunteer positions, affected relationships, and has threatened and is threatening my career. 

Earlier this year was my 6th attempt and I did pretty well for several months. Then everything going on in the world and the stress of school drove me back and I hate it. I used to use it to escape difficult emotions and cope with ADHD/ bipolar, but now that I have both under control medically, it's just a 6-year-long almost uninterrupted habit I can't break. And I hate how it ruins my studies and social life, and it almost made me gain back the ~60 lbs I lost by dieting. I just want to kick it out of my life for good.

I was seriously injured while high and need to talk about it. TW: description of my injury is a bit graphic,"I posted the following on /r/eldertrees and was told this might be a good community to talk to, too. Here goes:


Weed had been my sleep and migraine medicine for a while. I have chronic health issues and it's been a blessing for it. Something that comes with my health issues, though not very often and only a few times in my life, is fainting due to low blood pressure, or vasovagal syncope. Apparently, THC can lower your blood pressure. 

A bit over a week ago, I had used my dry herb vape and got into the shower to get ready for bed after a long work day. A hot shower, and heat can also trigger vasovagal syncope, but it had been years since I last fainted so I had stopped paying mind to too hot of showers. I felt a little off and dizzy in the shower but just thought it was normal and because I was just feeling a bit high. I got out of the shower, picked up my towel which had fallen onto the floor, and then started to walk out of the bathroom. It was the perfect storm of triggers to make me faint: heat, THC, standing up quickly, and just being exhausted from work. Instead of going to get dressed for bed, I fainted and fell forward very, very hard. 

Next thing I know my husband is screaming my name and yelling ""oh my God, oh my God, wake up!"" There's blood everywhere and I look to see my two front teeth on the floor in front of me. My front teeth had broken my fall and basically ripped through my gums and came right out of my mouth. After waking up, I'm dazed, panicking, probably in a bit of shock, but my husband helps me get dressed and we rush to the ER. I faint again in the car. Once we get to the ER they put my teeth back in, gave me stitches because a different tooth had gone through my bottom lip, and I had oral surgery a few days later to reset my teeth as another one was so our of place it was affecting my bite. I've got weird braces holding my teeth in place, lots of pain, and likely will need root canals on all the affected teeth. But all things considered, you would never be able to tell any of this happened to me. Now that the swelling is down, I just have the weird braces to show for it and a couple of healing cuts on my lip.

But I'm just traumatized. I barely got through writing this and was shaking the whole time. I'm terrified to faint again (a relative of mine died after fainting and hitting their head so that hasn't been far from my mind) and getting injured. I'm having severe anxiety all the time, though I am hopefully getting into therapy soon with my husband as he's traumatized, too. He thought I was dead at first when I fell I'm pretty sure. I'm scared of being high, I'm scared of the panic attack it might bring. But I'm back to my insomniac ways again and it's so frustrating. I can't shower without my husband in the room. 

With my health issues, maybe weed and I just don't mix, which is a shame because it was so helpful before all of this. I still can't believe it happened, it doesn't feel real at all. But it did and this has pretty much altered my relationship with a plant that had been so helpful to me and I used daily just a week ago. And don't get me wrong, I don't solely blame the weed or think it's bad or dangerous in itself. Like I said, it was the perfect storm, unfortunately. But it was a contributing factor to me fainting, which scares me from using it again.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this, maybe just for catharsis because I'm so upset about what's happened. If you made it this far, thanks for reading and keep an eye on yourself if you're prone to fainting when you're smoking so that you don't end up injuring yourself.",16,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974092841148376}"

Cried so much, my emotions almost pushed me to get high but thank god I have my girlfriend in my life, she kept me going strong and held me tight when it got real rough.

The first week was really a breeze for me I didn’t really feel too different. But on day seven is when it really all hit me at once. I’ve been having trouble getting motivated at work, everyday activities that I found to be entertaining whilst being high have little to no appeal to me at the moment, and the depression has kicked into high gear. One thing that keeps me from just giving in is that I want better out of my life. I’ve been working dead end jobs since I graduated high school barely making enough to get by but I’d spend my money on getting high anyway. Another reason being that my mom is so proud of me for the first time in a long time. (Not that she wasn’t proud of me before but I’m actually giving her a reason to be this time other than just being her son) Its just hard to not give in when I’m feeling this shitty for so long I’ve just numbed myself to every emotion and actually having to face them is difficult. I’ve attempted to quit many times before but it was because I lost my and didn’t have the funds to support my habit or I just didn’t know where to get any at certain times. This time however I’ve get the money to fuel it but I really just want to be done with it for good. I’ve watched it slowly ruin my life throughout the years. Before using I used to be such a goal oriented kid I wanted to go to college out of high school and get a degree in something that I would enjoy and would provide me a comfortable income that I could life off of. But all that went out of the window when I started smoking. I also ruined a 5 year relationship with someone i loved more than anything because she wanted more for her life and I was content with just doing the bare minimum just so I could get high. I know this paragraph is all over the place but my mind is 
Not at its best right now. I was hoping maybe I could get some advice from some of you who were once in my position. Like what got you through the rough parts of quitting.

I have been a daily cannabis user for about two years now and in that time I've developed some stomach issues. I experience nausea almost every morning, vomit some mornings, and weed is one of the only things that relieves it. Over those two years, I've occasionally had severe abdominal pain, especially in my lower abdomen, and it's particularly violent this week, preventing me from going to school and work. I've done some research on Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome and definitely think it's a plausible explanation for what I've been going through. My bloodwork always comes back fine and after just returning from the ER, they found nothing on my CT scan either.

I've been attempting to work on my usage with my therapist since March but I have not made a lot of progress as I continually give in to urges and have trouble keeping up with a journal of my use (which is helpful when I can use is consistently.) My initial reason for posting is I'm trying to think of what may help in me trying to cease use for at least a few days (trying to take it slowly.) I've only given it an honest attempt before and only lasted about 3 days because the nausea and vomiting were so bad. I've heard of detox drinks but it seems most professionals say they trick your urine and don't actually help THC get out of your system. My primary question is if there are ways to speed up the detox process and of course any suggestions you have found helpful for the first few days.

Instead of waiting to get home and immediately smoke and watch tv I am able to hang out with people without looking at the clock or feeing like being somewhere else. I can enjoy activities without the need to find some weed. I hang out with better people for sure. I’m present in my life and not hazed out. I can go to school and not sneak in the bathroom trying to hide the smoke. I can do homework without thinking about what Id rather be doing. I can make money and not waste it on a disgusting habit and instead save for the future. I can lift and become uncomfortable and grow as a person. I don’t have a constant guilt anymore, I realized I’m a good person.

Yah it’s a bit awkward when people ask if I smoke or drink since especially at my age (17) that’s what all the “cool” kids do and I’m fine with them doing them but I know for me it only causes problems. I can’t do it occasionally or once in a blue moon, it’s all or nothing for me which is hard to say but true. 

I started my sober journey from a mental hospital struggling with anger after a huge fight with my parents well about weed. Now we have a great relationship and my family is much more peaceful than it was.

Days 1-3 I barely ate anything at all and I'm already thin at 6' 145lbs. Days 4 and 5 I was able to eat small portions of white rice I cooked in chicken stock. Last night I ate a grilled cheese and a bowl of soup.

Today on my 7th day I rode my bike a couple miles and got Chick-Fil-A, I was craving it outta nowhere. I ate around 3/4th's of the sammich and a couple fries. It tasted weird to me and wasn't as delicious as it usually is. Before I stopped smoking I'd just blaze up between getting home with CFA and eating. But I'm so happy I was able to eat some real food/meat today.

I’ve been smoking constantly all day everyday for the past 1.5 years. When I first started I only smoked a little at night but then turned into an an all day thing. I dealt with insomnia and anxiety and it really helped me. For the past 1.5 years I started to notice I couldn’t hold a conversation very well, I couldn’t think of things to add because of constant brain fog and I hated it. I started to notice that it made me quiet and insecure. I thought about a time before I started and I was never like that before. I noticed that all I thought about was going home to smoke a fat bowl and getting super high. I started to feel depressed when I wasn’t smoking all day. ( due to lack of weed/money) Recently I started having really bad anxiety whenever I smoked and couldn’t get out of my head no matter what. It used to be the opposite, I would smoke and all my cares would go away but now when I smoke it feels like all my problems come to the surface and my mind races. The WORST part is, is that my parents supported me smoking and would buy it for me. They also supported me quitting too though. It was just really hard to quit when everyone else is smoking around me and I couldn’t. I recently started to really worry about my mental/physical health from VERY heavy use. I would smoke around a gram a day. I started to feel depressed when I couldn’t smoke and that’s when I decided I needed to make a change. I also started to think about all the damage it’s doing to my (young) lungs. 

Recently I told myself I’m done smoking for good and I only went 6 days. The 6 days were complete hell. I was completely fine during the day (maybe because my mind was occupied) but once nighttime hit and I was getting ready for bed, I would get hit with this VERY HEAVY wave of sadness and depression. I would just sit on my bed and cry for absolutely NO REASON. It felt like my life was falling apart. I couldn’t sleep and I couldn’t eat. It was horrible. So after 6 days I was just said “fuck it, my life is already tough right now (dealing with family issues) so I’m not going to try to quit yet” and smoked. Immediately, after smoking, I felt super guilty and disappointed in myself and felt even more sad. It’s 3pm today and I’ve held off on smoking but I want to so bad. At this point it feels as if smoking is a chore so I don’t feel like shit. I feel like the hardest part of quitting for me is the boredom. I just moved right when the virus hit so I wasn’t able to go to school and make friends. So I was super bored and just smoked all day. Then school started up again and I am pretty occupied until about 2 o’clock then I just feel insanely bored. I feel like nothing interests me. I actually picked up skateboarding to help occupy  me but I can only skate board for so long until I have to come home and face the sadness/depression wave that comes every night when I try to quit...

Am I missing something?","Hello fellow leavers. I have to start this post by quickly saying I do love and appreciate all of you. Its been a while since I posted, but the trials and triumphs I continue to see here invigorate me, and I am typically moved in the best of ways. I feel at home here, something I have not known as much as many.

That being said, I have a legit question for anyone who has experience to provide. I keep hearing the first two weeks of quitting are the worst. The DSM V (psychological diagnosis handbook, essentially) even states the typical withdrawal period of 1-2 weeks.

Is this true? To clarify, what I mean when I refer to withdrawals it is the intense cravings blurring all other thought, edginess/agitation/low patience, mild depression, loss of lust for general hobbies/nothing brings true pleasure (hand in hand with mild depression), etc. I am aware things aren't going to be magically okay, but will the 14th or 15th day really be the time when things start the path to normal again? 

I have hobbies and things to do. I have school, and I have a 3D printer I put together but have barely had time to tweak and use. So its not an issue of not having things to fill my time. I just couldn't care less about doing any of them. I force myself to do what is needed, but its exhausting. 

I'm in therapy for general issues I havent fixed, and thats helped equip me with more tools than I knew I needed. I think this is one of my last real fears with quitting: the way I feel 5 or 7 days in IS NOT how I want to spend life. I would honestly rather spend a life stoned than threaten divorce every time my wife leaves the lid off of the peanut butter jar (not a literal example, but pretty damn close). I guess I just need some clarification from the veterans here, and through that hopefully some inspiration.

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to be as clear as I could be. I also hope some of my fellow leavers find some answers, and maybe peace, through any experience garnered by others. 

Lastly, love you all and best of luck with your struggles. We are individually strong enough to conquer this. Together we are unstoppable.

EDIT: Thank you all for your input and advice. You have given me a lot to think about. The two week rule seems to be a thing, but I think I am seeing what my struggle has been. I tend to go into the quitting period with a sense of dread instead of excitement and wonder. This has been stuck in the back of my mind since reading all these comments, and I think I have made another step towards understanding and health. The real question I should be asking isn't how long all this lasts. I should be asking ""What am I gaining from this?"" Meant in the sense that there is obviously some positive coming out of this decision, and that's what I need to focus on.

Thank you all for your support and incredible insight. I'm going to take some time and meditate on everything you all have brought up. I didnt necessarily get the answers I wanted, but I definitely got what I needed.

To all of you currently struggling, I am right there with you. To those of you who are succeeding, you are an inspiration to us all.

How can I stop?","I was a casual smoker in high school and a daily smoker for a chunk of college. Eventually, smoking started to have adverse physiological reactions. I would shake, get extremely cold (more so than normal), and have seemingly uncontrollable, obtrusive and negative thoughts about the end of the world, or of my own life. Now, I couldn't smoke if I wanted to because of how bad these effects are. I haven't smoked in over a year, despite my boyfriend asking me to try different strains and ingestion methods in attempts to give me a ""good high"" instead of a bad one. 

I've been working in therapy to be more diligent about self care and anxiety management but it's difficult, especially without social support or peers I can relate to. I wish I could just smoke a blunt like they do... It's so hard to feel like everyone around me has a ""relax"" button they can press when things get too difficult for them while I struggle to feel calm. I feel envy and loneliness :/

After stumbling onto this subreddit from Googling “withdraw symptoms of quitting marijuana”, I was blown away by how relatable everyone is here as well as the immense support everyone provides. With that said, I had to make an account on Reddit and involve myself in both sharing my story and supporting everyone else.

Some background here; I started smoking when I was 13 and am now 28. I’ve tried to quit many, many, many times throughout the years and have been unsuccessful. It is to the point where I use the term “fasting” instead of “quitting”. The reasoning for me wanting to quit is due to a number of factors: my mental/physical health, my wife and 3 children and our finances. 

I believe the reason I became addicted to marijuana was mostly due to my OCD and GAD. When high, the overactive thoughts would subside and panic would diminish, enough to relax me and allow me to think clearly. I would consider myself a high-functioning stoner. I typically smoked Sativa for its uplifting effects and was primarily a day smoker. I tried to stay away from the “couch potato” strains and I also worried about gaining a lot of weight and being overly lazy.

I want to be the best husband and father to my wife and children and I know I don’t have the same energy, mental clarity or drive when I’m high. My withdrawal symptoms are irritability, tiredness, anxiety, nightmares and cold sweats. I’ve done reading on how marijuana affects your dopamine production and am hoping I can reverse those effects. It all starts with saying “no more”.

Alright, I’m off my soapbox. Thank you for reading this far! I figure if I share my story and determination to “quit”, that it’ll help hold me accountable, I’ll learn from this community and hopefully I can help keep others on the straight and narrow.

So how does 8 months feel? Pretty damn grand actually! I'm a cross addict and as it's relevant to my weed addiction I'll go into it a little in a sec... But in terms of commitment to my weed sobriety? Stronger than ever and feeling 1% proud. Maybe 5%. Can't be greedy right?! The PAWS seems to be, well, gone. Or mainly gone, feels amazing! 😄

On the 29th September I fell off a wagon. Not THE wagon, the one we're all here for, but it terrified me a bit. No, a lot. It was a lapse of concentration that lead me back to how I'd felt when I was using drugs. It was rapid and it was messy. I've adopted ways of avoiding pitfalls since I got sober by forward planning but didn't that day and so a hole was fallen into.

Looking back now, weed didn't tempt me during it. In fact, at no point during it did I think of smoking. Maybe cos I was too busy drinking myself into oblivion. The morning after however... When I woke and had half a bottle of vodka left but nothing to drink it with feeling worthless... When going to the shop to buy a mixer for my booze would have I'm 90% sure lead me to buying tobacco to smoke weed with cos ""why not, you're a total fuck up already...""

Luckily, a wise man questioned me on whether I had any drink left. I couldn't lie. That was what I did as an addict. And I **hated** being a liar. The vodka met the sink soon after. The truth of the matter is, I was hours away from a total relapse and oblivion. And I knew it. 

I've let myself brood over it all for a bit but ultimately I'm still going. And although a bit battered and bruised I learned from it. Lizard brain was strong that day but only that day. So I worked through it like any other day.

And more surprisingly, once the reality of it all had sunk in (something I'd been denying for a while) I've found I'm still happy.  I worked hard for that, not letting that get away, no chance.

Crazy situation. Just like me.

It was well received and I hope that those who benefited from it are still fighting their fight as best they can. Expecting myself to reach 100 days, I tasted defeat shortly after reaching 60. I'm writing this now in an attempt to be honest with myself and to ask for support.

What halted my march to 100 days was a series of events which left me broken, both physically and emotionally. 

I experienced a sports injury which left me incapacitated for a few days, the pain became intolerable and I smoked, using the plant for pain relief. As most in this community can attest to, you'll not be surprised to read that I continued smoking after the pain became manageable. But without insurance and having no desire to dabble with painkillers, I'm actually thankful that I had a natural pain reliever for the days where I was in the most pain. No shame there.

A few weeks later, I experienced some of the worst emotional pain of my life when the relationship I had been in for 4 years suddenly came to an end. For the first time in as long as I can remember, I experienced the full breadth of sadness, as solitude became my only companion. The darkness that encapsulated my being was such that I honestly thought I might not make it back to the light. At the height of summer, with the world around me bathed in sun, my inner world was the opposite- an existence of grey where nothing survived for long. I smoked heavily in order to dam the flood of emotions until bits of light began to reappear. I felt myself being reborn and sensed life reemerging; I had been entirely broken while at the same time, partially reborn.

I guess I was what you'd class as a heavy user, smoking daily, probably around 10 times a day for 4 years, mixed with tobacco, from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep.   
I decided to quit both weed and tobacco because though I had many positive experiences whilst smoking, it had almost seemed to have ""turned on me"", probably due to overuse, in the last few weeks of smoking. Each time I did it, I felt anxious and my heart rate was pretty high till I sobered up again and I'd experience the odd heart skip when I was sat just relaxing. Once I had quit, I had horrible, constant anxiety and adrenaline rushes that seemed to last all day for at least two weeks. My sleep was affected in the form of an adrenaline rush just as I was starting to fall asleep that would jolt me awake, though I haven't experienced that in the last month or so now.  
Though it seems to be slowly getting better, what I HAVE still been experiencing recently is a seeming inability to relax when the smallest of stressful situations occur. Whether it's bickering with my partner, financial concerns or even playing a video game that gets particularly intense that I used to just take in my stride, I find it almost impossible to calm down for the whole rest of the day and I'll get occasional heart palpitations again.  
I want to clarify that I've seen a doctor several times in the last couple of months who believes it's just anxiety and withdrawal after deeming my heart structurally sound, but I feel like I'm going crazy and I'm not sure how to cope. I'm quick to panic or to cry over the smallest of things and I can feel tremendous surges of adrenaline and anxiety.   
I just wanted to be reassured that this will pass and that I'm not alone in this, so any advice or even just generally telling me your own experiences after quitting is more than welcome.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9939139485359192}"

When I was 15, I was playing Call Of duty really vigorously, but what I enjoyed even more was making fragmovies off of it. I was really good at it tbh. But as I stopped playing cod, so did I stop making videos. And then one year later I started smoking and stopped enjoying anything non weed related.

Fast forward to last year, I started to learn some photoshop, I did edits in one niche I was enjoying at that time. And same story, became really good at it really quickly, but I broke my streak and stopped. On top of it, it was frustrating experience because I was doing it on a shitty laptop and I didn't even enjoy that niche anymore. It was hurting my creativity also, because when you are doing something very niche, you are limited in what you can and can't do. 

But now, I am getting back to it. I have finally saved enough money and I have huge plans, next month I will be buying editing PC and I can't wait to see what I am capable of. 

But what really sucks is that if I didn't let that die out back then, I could be today in a totally different place. I wasted almost 10 years doing nothing and letting that die off. It really sucks.

Back in 2017, I quit smoking weed for about a year. I had begun a job at a healthcare setting and I knew they randomly drug tested, so I decided it was time to put my tendencies behind me and play it safe. 

Fast forward to January of 2018, and I sort of spiraled. My SO broke it off and it put me in a really dark place. Since that day I was smoking weed every single night in order to get some semblance of sleep. Every single night I would retire to my cute lil mini bong and smoke maybe half a bowl to a whole bowl. I know, not that hardcore, but whatever. 

The other thing is that I’m actually a pre-medical student and lately I’ve found that my short term memory has been shot to shit, and that is no bueno for classes like Biochemistry where you gotta memorize 20 amino acids, their structures, and properties. When I realized this (a month or two ago), I started to panic and have been attempting to quit smoking since then but I haven’t been able to do it. I don’t know what it is, and I’m not even sure it’s because of the break up anymore. I think I use weed as a way of taking a break from school. Like “if I get high, I can’t do schoolwork” so it’s like an excuse to take a needed break, if that makes sense.. 

So, as of right now, I’m only two days cannabis free and have been substituting my bong for a book and it’s been all right. Sleeping is still hard though. It takes so much longer to fall asleep and then I wake up at like 6am only to toss and turn and fall back asleep for a few more hours. I’m hoping the whole sleeping thing gets better as I continue to be cannabis free, but really I have no other choice as a healthcare professional and as a student. I need to have better cognitive focus and memory if I ever hope to achieve what I want to achieve. 

Anyway, yeah... just wanted to put this out here and maybe get some support. I haven’t actually told anyone I know that I’m quitting because I don’t want the additional pressure of trying to live up to what I claim, but I needed to type this out and put it out there. Thank you for reading and I hope you get to where you want to be as well.",21,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993815422058105}"

I'm now at day 78 without any type of cannabis after consuming after 5 pm daily for \~10 years.  
I've been checking in every \~20 days or so and wanted to post an update.  


The first \~20 days or so were just focused on not smoking--every free minute I had, I had to keep re-convincing myself to not smoke.   
Then, from about day 20-50, it was a lot easier. Instead, I just got back into the hang of life without cannabis; during this period it was more about finding activities I liked, almost like I was dating myself again, ha. During this time period, I found I got frustrated less, I was able to express myself better, I was keeping my home and workspaces clean with much more ease--generally, I was less exhausted and had energy for regular things that before would make me drained just thinking about (household chores, etc.)  


From day 50-now it's been a lot more about finding new ways to de-stress. At work around day 50, I got a new assignment that came with having to learn a lot of new things, work with a lot of new people. It was stressful. That stress was eating me alive from day 65-75. My old de-stress of lighting one up wasn't there anymore. My typical stress relief of playing video games wasn't cutting it (even though I play relaxing games,  like Animal Crossing). My partner actually stopped me one day and sat me down. He saw the stress was getting to me. He said that he's worried about my health and that we're in this together for the long-haul (been together over 10 years) and I need to find new ways to de-stress.  


He was right.  
So I made a plan. The plan was this: find out how people who don't smoke cannabis de-stress.   


Seems simple, right?  


Well, on that journey I discovered that there is actually a different type of relaxation than just zonking out in front of the TV: deep relaxation. So I started looking for things that promoted deep relaxation. My health insurance offers free access to some apps, MyStrength and Calm, that I've been using and have been really helpful. Calm has guided meditations and meditation series (around topics, like stress relief!) and MyStrength is more of a psychological helper, teaching tools, techniques, and awareness of behavioral patterns.  


Another component of this is exercise, so I'm working on COVID friendly exercises for me (gyms are closed where I am), so I have a plan to start a  jump rope and a stretching routine.  


So De-stress is my focus lately from day 78 on. I realized if I want to keep cannabis out of my life, I have to invest in ways to de-stress regularly and also in the moments I need it most.

So many changes are happening over the past week here. It's almost been a full week since I had a panic attack, I am slowly starting to get a bit more sleep, my sex drive is coming back, I'm in the mood to workout again! The brain fog isn't sooo thick anymore (although it is still there along with a touch of anxiety) 

I really never thought I was going to feel better. At one point, I thought I broke my brain and even went to the doctor to have him do a brain scan and a physical brain test. 

I have been through an ass ton of trauma for a 28 year old. I've been coping with pot since last August when my son died in my arms. Pot was there when I needed it. I was never addicted though, it was just a crutch for me. 

After suffering a concussion back in July, I couldn't smoke as much. Slowly, and unaware that I was doing it, I started weening off. Then September 5th, we went to our gold claim in BC, my husband offered me a joint. I took a hoot and I had the WORST panic attack of my life. I decided that was the last straw. 

Now, like I said. I've been through alot of shit. So taking my crutch away was very hard. I thought I was going through psychosis. I was shivering in my bed every day, I was having very invasive thoughts, I was In and out of my body, I couldn't think, I couldn't eat, I lost 15lbs in 2 weeks because I just couldn't eat the anxiety and stress was that bad. 

I'm working with counselors in both NLP and CBT as well as meditating and practicing rewiring my brain on my own too. I've never really been the most compassionate person when it came to how I treated myself. 

I had one slip up. One day where I couldnt handle the anxiety anymore and I tried a small hoot off my one hitter. I made my anxiety worse but thank god it was only a tiny hit and it wore off within minutes. I can't throw all the green away because my partner smokes too. But it's okay, I don't want it anymore. I made that choice 39 days ago. 

Anyways. I was terrified. I didn't know if these were all normal withdrawal effects, but after speaking with both my psychiatrist and my family doc, I was educated on trauma, crutches, and what happens when you take those away. 

So for those of you just starting and have a load of trauma and are already an anxious person, it will be okay. You are strong enough to get through this. The night sweats, terrors, invasive thoughts, no appetite, pure stress, lack of motivation, exhaustion, insomnia, no interest in music or hobbies, anti social behaviour. It is all normal. I urge you though to have lots of support beside you. I have a homeopath, psychiatrist, family doc and friends and family by my side. You need people who understand and have patience and want to see you get better by your side. Not the opposite

3 weeks sober tonight after 22 years of smoking every day, 37m. I should feel happy and proud. I kinda do. I'm just not sure. My turning point and motivation to quit was having a mental breakdown over a month and getting angry at my best friend/fuck buddy and losing her

First full breakdown
It started off knowing that I needed to change my life. Ive had bad anxiety and depression for quite a while. Never, ever thought weed was the cause of the problem. A few months ago I went to the doc, one I've been seeing for over a year now, and he put me on antidepressants thinking that was my problem. He never asked about drugs or alcohol then or in the past, and I didn't think I'd tell him cause I wanted to keep smoking. They worked for a bit but something was still off, they felt like they were numbing my emotions and making me forget things, a lot more with weed.

Breakdown week 1
I stopped the meds after 3 months just because I forgot to take them for a few days, have my own IT business and was working a lot and smoked a tonne of weed. So I thought I'd try without them after that, didn't see the doc cause you know I knew better.. ffs. Worst thong ever, cold turkey off the meds without medical advice, made the anxiety and depression a lot worse. But weed made it ok to handle, and it did for a week.

Breakdown week 2
A week later I started freaking out again, this time thought I needed to exercise cause I heard great things about providing the natural chemicals our bodies want/need. So I started jogging and doing a few weights. This helped a little, until another week later.

Breakdown week 3
Something was still not right, so I thought what else could it be, still blinded by weed and thinking that's not the problem, i now thought I needed love to complete me. I had a best friend that I was fucking on the side occassionaly, every other month/week sometimes, and I asked if she wanted to maybe take things further, we got on well, have lots in common, and the sex was great. But she didn't take it as i hoped and didn't want that. She stopped talking to me for a while.

Let me also explain that I live in Melbourne Australia and we have been on lockdown for a few months now cause of covid, meaning no travel at all if not deemed necessary, so I couldn't see friends at all. Like a fucken prison in my own house. This didn't help those past few weeks.

So all of these things just sent me on a downward spiral, I was freaking out not knowing what was going to make me feel better. I cried a lot. I made a video of myself crying so I could look back on it if I needed to know how low i got. It then dawned on me that I needed to stop smoking, idk why I didn't think of it before, well I do, i was blinded by it. My friends were all successful smoking weed, as I said I have my own business and weed just made me feel more content. So I never looked at weed being the main problem. and throughout the 22 years, i didnt smoke in the mornings, only in the afternoon or during the day on weekends, but it was everyday.

The thing that hurt me was that I tried to explain to my best friend that my problems were because of weed. I was freaking out for the month and was numbing it with weed, blinding myself of the real problem. Well it was numbing my life for 22 years really. 

But she said to me that she couldn't support me! I knew I needed to do this myself as only I could so I was like that's ok but I didn't understand why, and it did hurt. We didn't speak much again after that, we used to talk everyday about everything. Since that day, she has asked how I've been lately and I had a really good chat with her yesterday and she explained a few things about why she couldn't support me, I'm just not sure I understand still. But she has never congratulated me for quitting and that's kinda all I wanted from her the whole time, it hurts me and makes me feel like she doesn't give a shit about me.

I've opened up to someone I thought I could and I got shoved away.

She wants to give me space, but after these 3 weeks I just want to go back to how things were a month before this, while I go through this, even if she doesn't directly say things about supporting me, just want our daily chats back to take my mind off things. It makes me anxious thinking about how I hurt her and how I changed our relationship.

I know I need to give her space, but I'm not sure if we'll ever go back to being really good friends, but if I don't give her space I'd lose her forever. We have another few weeks in lockdown, but I just want to see if she wants to hang out cause that's when we're best, just chilling. we have a lot in common and do a lot of the same things together, and have a lot of the same friends. She doesn't smoke and hates it.

And I get it, if she's a real friend then we'll be ok in the end, just don't know why it feels like she doesn't give a shit about me.

I'm 100% not going to smoke because I know it won't help anything, my video and thoughts on these past couple of months ensures I don't. I'm just a little lost. If you made it to this point thanks for reading too 🙏 I just needed to say something somewhere, even if no-one reads the whole thing ☮️ I already feel a little better just by typing this. I'll be back in a few weeks to say how good I'm killing this addiction. Leavers thinking about quitting realise that weed is the devil's smoke and it can hide a lot of who you really are and who you can be, it's not worth the high, it creates anxiety or depression and destruction of relationships... and these sorts of rants lol you can all do better than me by stopping earlier than I have in life and live the life you want.

I haven’t posted at all here yet. I’m 23 (like a lot of you!) and have been smoking pretty much daily since I was 19. I always was fascinated by weed but was always too anxious when i got high to really enjoy the good parts. However, after Trump got elected, the entire world seemed to start to unravel, and I experienced a severe unrelated traumatic incident, so I really started to smoke. I began by basically forcing myself to find something to put me in an altered state,,,essentially because I knew alcohol was addictive so I made hard and fast rules about alcohol consumption, but weed seemed safe and harmless. So, I bought a tiny bubbler. 

Four years later, I’ve ruined friendships and relationships, fucked up opportunities, cost myself thousands of dollars, and generally just really fucked things. I’m still doing fine and have accomplished a lot, but am beginning to falter as I move through my first semester of grad school. So, after losing multiple important people and a few opportunities because of my weed-induced irresponsibility, disaffectedness, and apathy, I gave everything weed-related away to friends and am now on night 2. 

I have terrible restless legs without weed, and am essentially incapable of sleep without it either. Which is very worrying for me, as I can’t become reliant on a sleep aid. But that’s a bridge I’ll cross when I arrive at it. I’ve done a (circumstantial) 21 day break in the years since I started smoking and I survived then, so I know I can do this for good this time—even if I don’t sleep for a few days 👎🏼 wish me luck!!!",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9474852681159973}"

I stood outside of my college smoking a cigarette and someone walked up to me with a blank card with a green dot and a phone number and I've been calling it since 2005. 

Man it's pathetic isn't it? I've numbed everything. All of my ambition, my passion, my goals because I've been living on the dark side of the moon for so long.  I've chosen THC over everything. It hasn't cost me everything however, I've been a fully unfunctional user at times but mostly I've learned to be a high level marijuana user. Using constantly no matter what obligation is before me. Most people would think something was off with me if I was actually sober. 

I guess the story peaks in August of last year, new apartment, I decided to downgrade to save money so I took a place with new roomates and learned quickly that I was living with a mid-level weed dealer. Amazing right? Ounces for $140... Sheeeeeeeeeeeit. Everything changed. Then it wasn't long before the world changed and everyone in NYC went indoors and stayed there, and in a large part still are. 

My habit went through the roof. I was smoking more and spending less than ever before. But I knew it was a big problem now, I had nothing to do but rake in money for nothing (Unemployment and pandemic assistance) and smoke smoke smoke. 

Well all good things come to an end and eventually I decided to stop buying from my roommate, just to prove a point to him. That he didn't own me in any way.

So I moved onto carts... 8 carts a month was my average. All of this addiction shared by a wonderful loving girlfriend who was just as marooned as I was. 

She's always been stronger than me and was always the first one to say ""hey we should try and cut down, we should try and quit""... But on September 19th I said to her as we were picking up a new batch of carts. ""I'm doing Sober October and that's that"". She was on board easy and here we are. 

It's 12 days in and honestly I'm doing just fine. I'm tense, overly sweaty, and not sleeping as well as I would like. But I'm not freaking out. I'm in control right now and it feels great. It feels so good to not text that number and wait for my delivery. To have to go out to the car and do the deal. 

Days 1-5 were the worst though. Those days built to a complete meltdown. Where everything I've been hiding for years and years came to the surface. I'd been numbing my passion and my ambition for so long. And I'm so unhappy with my career and my lack of passion for it and ... I'm in a specialized field that you can only make a living in a big city like NYC. You have to have drive otherwise it's a complete waste of time. I'm really excited to hit the ground running when the pandemic let's up. I've bee trying for years to get where I want to be and battling giving up and going back to my rural southern state to have a mundane easy ""normal"" life and job. But I can't live with myself if I don't really try this sober. 

I started my journey on October 1st as a Sober October attempt but after day 5 I knew it had to be a forever thing for me. There is no doing back unless I want to stay there forever, and whew I'm at right now I know that I want to go forward. 

When you smoke all day everyday... Being sober is almost like a high itself. Learning that life is delicious without weed is really fucking cool. 

I can go on a vacation and not have to smuggle drugs on the DL, I can actually be happy wherever I go, so long as I'm sober. I know day 12 isn't a huge accomplishment, but I feel like I've broken my chains. 

One of the hardest parts is saying forever though. My whole identity is wrapped in a marijuana leaf. It's who I've been everywhere I've ever gone. But I do recognize that itself is quite pathetic and there is much more to life than being numb. 

Where am I at?

Day 12

Symptoms of Withdrawal -
Hyperhidrosis (sweating of hands, feet, pits and back)
Sleep issues (I can fall asleep but I toss and turn and wake up a lot)
Lack of sweet tooth (this is a positive)
General anxiety is pretty high (I'm trying to cut down major on caffeine due to this)
Increase bladder production (I may need to get my prostate checked I've herd that when quitting for heavy users this can be a major health issue)

One thing... So far no nightmares. In previous attempts of quitting I had really terrible night mares or even night terrors. 

Im currently not using alcohol, I will though after a full month of complete sobriety. 

That's where I am now. I decided to stay up late tonight to see if I sleep better when I'm really tired. And yes there are several corny Pink Floyd puns throughout this, I just couldn't resist.",7,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997373104095459}"

Made an alternate account to post on here, pretty easy for someone to see my main and connect the dots. Posting now because I hope someone, somewhere can gain something from reading about my journey. 

Today marks 3 weeks weed free after 10 years of habitual use. I quit because my SO had to quit for the career field he's pursuing, not because he asked me to, but because I'm a ""ride or die bitch,"" as my best friend says. I'd started socially smoking in junior year of high school, and turned into a daily smoker in my freshman year of college. While I was in school, I would stay high all day. Smoke on the way to school, between each class, on the way home, before bed... would even smoke on my lunch breaks at work. It never affected my studies or my work performance as far as I could tell, so it never seemed like a problem. I grew up a little in the past few years, and moved to only smoking after work and before bed. I viewed it as my glass of wine to unwind from the day, and it seemed more sustainable than my previous use while I was in college. However, seeing the differences in my daily life even within the short time I've abstained makes me a little upset at myself for not having quit sooner. 

Moving on to the side effects/withdrawal symptoms I've experienced since quitting... The most notable is the crazy, vivid, and sometimes disturbing dreams, which leave me exhausted even after a full night's sleep. They started about 3 days in and I'm still experiencing them almost every night. I can't wait until they subside. My sleep isn't restful and my days seem so long. Other side effects included increased anxiety and loss of appetite for about the first week or so, closely followed by some intestinal distress. I also experienced a good bit of brain fog, which I've found gets less noticable with every day that goes by. 

Onto the good news! As the brain fog continues to fade, I find myself in a more alert state of mind. It's easier to focus and be actively engaged in conversation. I feel so much more motivated, which has helped me transition into a new career. I've all but quit smoking cigarettes as well! I'd always chain smoke 3-4 cigarettes whenever I would toke, and now that that's not happening, I don't feel the need. Haven't had a cigarette in 3 days, and not sure I'll finish the pack I have. 

Another thing I like about being weed free is the fact that I don't have to worry about what would happen if I were to be pulled over or otherwise harassed by law enforcement. I live in an illegal state in a fairly conservative area, where it's not unusual to roll through a license check more than once a week. Search me now, assholes! 

All in all, I feel like quitting was one of the better decisions I've made in a long time. To anyone who's struggling with the thought of what sober life will be like after years of smoking, please know that it is worth it. With every day that passes, the cravings become less and less. Your mind clears up, and you realize that there is so much more to life than the next time you can hit a bowl. Take it one day at a time, and keep moving forward.

This is what I told myself day 1 when I was scared about not being able to eat my pre workout meal, or hit a good gym session, or be able to sleep. I had a routine and stuck to it religiously, something that I see in many posts on here... and it's scary breaking your routine. What is that fear based in? SELF LIMITATION!

My life became extremely unmanageable because of my abuse of weed. I became a daily smoker and although my life looked functional from the outside it was all but that. I was stuck in my compulsion, in a loop of smoking up to deal with anything life threw my way - good or bad. In the end, all it gave me was paranoia and shame and although I was well aware of these effects I would still go back to it - for months, for years - in hope that I could reap the benefits of getting high. It was never worth it, I’d be back at square one, spending money, isolating myself and thinking it was my honorable choice to do so. I wanted to smoke weed, so, what the fuck, I’m going to smoke it and I don’t care if I shouldn’t - tomorrow will be the time. But then I’d wake up with this dread, knowing that I screwed up and that there was nothing left to do but smoke. 

I decided to stop smoking up because I was tired of being tired and the consequences of my actions were ridiculous - on myself but importantly on others. I didn’t exist in a vacuum. The rage I felt when I didn’t have weed? My boyfriend took the blow. Being high all the time? My parents wouldn’t hear from me in days. My negativity, my lack of perspective? I dragged my friends into that. 

The first few weeks were really tough. I sweated so much, had the worst brain fog, cried for no reason, and the list goes on... but then it got better. I got the hang of not smoking up - I enjoyed the bit of money I had saved, I liked having more free time, I appreciated actually owning up to the million promises I’d made about quitting to myself and others. 

What worked, for me, was following a 12 step program. I’m not going to preach, but it helped me get out of my head and gave me concrete tools to evaluate my behavioural patterns. At the end of the day, it’s what’s in my head that got me to the dark place of addiction. The program made me realize that I have no control of people, places or things. All I can control is myself and my actions.

Now, 4 months in, I feel a lot better. I have bad days where I feel like garbage, but I am able to cherish the good days and really live in them. I feel much more equipped to deal with life. I am more open with my boyfriend, I actually look forward to things now, and the obsession has waned. I know I need to keep myself in check though; it’s easy to get cocky.

All I’m trying to say is that it is so, so worth it. It fucking sucks that we’re addicted but we did this to ourselves and need to own up to our actions. We need to take charge of our lives and change the course before even more damage is done. It’s tough and there’ll be shitty days where you’re out of your comfort zone and just want a fucking break, but every time you say no to weed you get stronger and build the muscle. It’s just a drug, you’ve lived without it before and the people who’ve conquered their addictions mostly seem to be enjoying themselves. Cherish the ability to grow and move forward.

Weed was okay at first, but it's gotten progressively worse. When I smoke, all I do is internalize everything. I become so introspective that I freak myself out about my own life. I constantly think about who I am, what I'm doing, etc.

On one had, this introspection is great since it allows me to see flaws in myself or areas that I need to improve on. On the otherhand, it's gotten out of control. I become way too introspective, and it's gotten to the point that I don't know what introspective thoughts about myself are even real. It seems like my grenade of thoughts goes off in my mind, and half those thoughts are just bullshit thoughts to freak myself out.

I feel stable and capable for the first time since probably 2011. I am starting to feel my old self seep back in and these last couple of weeks have been everything I have wanted for a long time. There is a difference in me though as I feel like I have matured and getting to know my sober self is an interesting process. I am not drawn to seeing friends at the moment and I think this is because I am hitting my stride in my projects and don't want distraction but it's also that I'm building myself and I don't need anyone elses input or perception of who they think I am. It's something I need to feel into myself. I think also this is a time for reflection rather than extending myself and that's OK. It's just very different as I used to be all about my friends.

My anxiety is now low and proportionate. The things that would have sent me to bed or a panic attack, I'm dealing with them head on now. It had gone on for so long I identified with this behaviour and I'm so pleased to not have that in my life anymore.

I haven't cried in weeks. Earlier this year I was crying every day as the weed was bubbling my trauma up the the surface and I was reliving hell all the time. It was incredibly dark. Thankfully I had a therapist to help me pull myself out.

I've been consistently productive for a couple of weeks now with long bouts of productivity in the last 2 months. I'm not feeling resistant to chores or like I'm dragging myself through the day now and at the end of the day I can fully relax and be satisfied I've done enough.

The first month was awful - panic attacks, sweats, couldn't sleep, Hulk rage fits, brain fog, deep depression, insane violent dreams. Early in the second month the anxiety, rage and sweats lifted. The brain fog and dreams stayed and the depression was better but still took me to my bed some days. I still couldn't focus on work and was starting to worry I'd broken my brain. Thanks to the leavers who reassured me and gave me advice. In this time I had anhedonia and felt totally flat but that was so much better than breaking down all the time so it didn't bother me. In the last couple of weeks, something has shifted. I am feeling well. I no longer feel like everything is boring and life is drudgery. I was overwhelmed with boredom and was literately bored to tears at some points. I haven't felt that in a couple of weeks. I guess it was the lack of dopamine or something. I am engaged and interested in what I'm doing now.

My life is busy and I would have like to have had the time to have an exercise routine, read more and go down the beach. It felt like a necessary part of my recovery that I wasn't getting and I really struggled with this - feeling hemmed in by my to do list and how boring it all was. But that is life. I am sober in my real life and that is what it looks like. Recovery time and space is mostly for the rich I would imagine and it's probably done me a favour to have real life challenges as I know I can deal with things sober. I might have second guessed myself at some point if I'd done this on easy mode.

I'm currently doing the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction programme which is helping a lot. I highly recommend it for those who are past the first high waves of withdrawal. I intend to start an exercise regime once the bulk of my projects are sorted and I look forward to losing some weight and being able to buy some new clothes to build my sense of self.

I don't have any expectations as I'm sure my brain has a lot more healing to do but this wellness that I'm experiencing right now is golden. Thanks for all your insight and support.

It's been a while since we broke up, doesn't matter but just know that sometimes I'm stuck telling myself that I'll never get over not talking or being with her in some way because I never lose friends easily. It's the same with a former best guy friend that stabbed me in the back: the feeling of losing someone really close to you you just can't talk to anymore sucks ass, man. 

With this girl, she was one of the first people I met who talked like me and thought the same way as me and she just *listened* man, the ways that my family never really could and I miss her a lot. Romantically it was such a major headache and I don't think made the best couple at the time. I always felt like I was 1000% more into her than she was into me, so it was destined to flop once I left for college. 

Anyways, I guess I don't miss talking to her more so than I just miss talking to someone *like* her, that let me go on my long rants and tangents and geek out about a million different things because she liked me instead of my other friends just tolerating it because they have to.

Now every time I see her post whatever it just makes me feel like shit. And I can't tell if she's dating this one guy from our hometown and I don't know why it bothers me so much and I can't keep it out of my head, and it sucks that I don't have the ability to turn my brain off anymore and not overthink and analyze everything.

And all of this just sucks because she reminds me of how I used to be able to talk about random bullsit and talk for hours with my dad, but he's not here anymore and I just feel... alone. So, so, so alone. And I miss my friends back in college and I miss my friends back here before they all moved and I can't tell if I want to go back to high school or back to that fleeting moment of college getting high as shit all the time with my friends. I don't know what I want but I just feel stuck and I'm tired of feeling this way. 

It sucks that it feels like she doesn't or didn't care about me ever. It sucks that I don't think she misses me at all. It sucks missing the idea of someone more than you miss the actual person because for every person who I can't talk to in the same way, it's like a empty mold that I know needs to be filled and I'm always reminded that it's not.

I'm working on my writing and it reminds me so much of how I used to talk to her and my dad and all the friends I lost along the way and it hurts sometimes to just write, you know? I'm sad, dude. I'm really sad. And I've been sad for a long time and this just keeps coming back until it stops before I go on Instagram and I hate it so much. It's hard to not go on it though because I have to run the social media for my club.

Not the first time I've quit. I've had streaks of a few months before, but I always go back to smoking daily. This last time I was smoking constantly was the worst of my life. I would smoke immediately in the morning, and sometimes smoke 3g in a day, because I was buying 1 gram joints from the dispensary. I even developed a smoker's cough, which was a weird experience, since I've never been a cig smoker.

Current status: cough is gone. Sleep is hard to gauge since I've always had sleep problems and have gone through periods of insomnia throughout my whole life, but I guess it's been fine lately. I thinkkkk I dream but not that often or vividly. 

The whole brain adjusting to sobriety is tough. I have ADHD anyways, and my ability to focus has especially sucked lately. I've been having mood swings. I also have anger problems, and with the whole change of brain chemistry going on I can get REALLY pissed for like no reason. I have a bad habit of thinking about someone who betrayed me in the past (it's happened a lot) and getting mad about it all over again.

I finally got enough inspiration to quit because I decided I want to start being politically active in some way and I've been educating myself in politics and history and such along with going to school full time. I was getting stoned regularly last school quarter and still got As, but for some reason this quarter is feeling a bit harder. 

There's also the whole COVID thing and the harsh political climate and my whole state caught on fire a couple weeks ago, so maybe the stress will go away.

37 y/o. Have smoked for 20 years as of last month. Not daily -  though for the last 2 years, daily. And oscillating between daily and random and not at all for many years in between university and when I started daily - university is a blur.

Not the first time I’ve quit, but this time I think it’s stuck. Or it has for now. I decided that I have spent enough time stoned - time to not be stoned. 

Craziest part - I was waiting til day 100 to post a wanted a big milestone. I’ve done a month before back a few years back took 2 months off but then relapsed. But I forgot on day 100 - it passed by without any real memory flaring up!

To anyone thinking about it - I see many in their early/mid 20s. Do it! If you have a problem, or think you do... trust me, you do.  I knew immediately that daily smoking wasn’t a good idea. But it felt too good. Duh! That’s the point!  I wonder what my life would be like had I done this earlier... I hope I can keep it up.

Maybe I’d have kids? My marriage would definitely be happier. I’m happy, but she’s... well I’ve destroyed any trust she had in me through weed.  But I’m doing better - being better.

Feeling sentimental.,"Yesterday marked 4 years since the last time I got high. I wish I knew about this community when I first quit, because I used to spend entire days doing nothing but getting stoned and browsing r/trees. I was so positive that weed wasn't addictive (""not habit-forming"" is what everyone says) that I watched my life fall apart and couldn't identify that the problem was my using until it was almost too late. Flunked out of college, got back in, flunked out again. Ghosted every employer I had. Stole thousands of dollars from my parents, always promising to pay it back.

I smoked all day, every day. I was incapable of facing my day without being stoned. The worst part of my day was the split second between waking up and reaching for my weed, because that was the only time I had to face my actual feelings and emotions about how much of a mess my life had become. I moved back in with my parents and quit cold turkey. The nightmares, the night sweats, the panic attacks all came with withdrawal. I also had really bad diarrhea, which I now know happens to other people too. I spent a few months living with my parents, not responding to any messages from friends asking how I was doing, and I finally got so desperately suicidal that I was afraid of what I would do if I couldn't get high, so I asked my parents to send me to rehab.  


I had no intention of staying sober after rehab. I was just there to figure out my depression, and maybe find some tricks for smoking less. I used to be a destructive drinker, and I knew I wasn't going back to that, so I saw my smoking as a necessary harm reduction to keep me from blacking out and really hurting people. Maybe I could go to some AA meetings and pick up some wisdom from people who'd been through worse shit than me.

I know twelve step isn't for everyone, and I really didn't like it at first. I couldn't get past the God stuff. I felt like a fly on the wall at AA meetings, because even though I might have drank alcoholically in college, I didn't stay up at night thinking about getting drunk. I fantasized about when I'd get high again.

Then, by sheer luck, the drug guy at my rehab told me there was a Marijuana Anonymous meeting within walking distance of the rehab residence. He told me it was a small group, one of only two in my state, but it was right there. A lot of twelve steppers would call this a ""godshot"" or some shit like that, but I don't see it that way. I just really fucking lucked out.

My first MA meeting was a revelation. A lot like finding out this community existed probably was for a lot of you. It turned out I wasn't insane. I heard my exact story told back to me from people I had nothing else in common with. Things that were private sources of shame for me became shared experiences. I thought I was the only person in the world who played games with his stash, setting rules about when I was allowed to get high and inevitably breaking them. 

So I kept going. Still wouldn't say ""I'm (name), and I'm a marijuana addict"" because I wasn't ready to admit that. Just ""(Name), and I'm a stoner"" at first. Then I got closer with people in the program and started working with a sponsor. A dude about my age who seemingly lost everything, and picked it back up. 

My life got better. I stayed in the city where my rehab was. I finished my last 4 college classes here and transferred them back to my old school and graduated. I held down the same job for three years until Covid hit, the longest I'd kept a job before that was maybe six months.

I've spent the last four years with varying levels of commitment to the program, sometimes going to two meetings a week, sometimes not going for months. Since the pandemic hit all the meetings have been on Zoom, which makes it easy for me to hit multiple meetings a day. I work an agnostic program with an agnostic sponsor, and I sponsor two guys. Since my state legalized in January, the rooms have exploded with newcomers and we need all the help we can get. 

It matters so much to me that people understand some of us are not wired to smoke casually. The weed is so potent now, and for some people like us, it just hits the perfect spot of euphoria and detachment. If weed affected all my friends the way it affected me, they would have had to quit too. It makes me furious that people are still suffering out there under this idea that their habit or addiction isn't taken seriously, and I want to do everything I can to break that silence.

&#x200B;

To give yall a little insight at first, im 1 week in of being sober and I am going to be honest, it´s really hard, but with every day that passes I receive new strenght and wisdom to continue my abstinence.

&#x200B;

Man today was really tough for me, I met up with some friend, we drank some alcohol and had a good time. A few hours in a few friends decided to roll up a joint and smoke it, the urge to partake and take some spliffs was so great, I really was close to giving in, but luckily I had a friend with me who also decided to take a break from weed and we both together could gather the strenght to pass on the joint and continue our streak. Man it was so f\*\*\*\*ng hard, I still wish I did take a puff of that joint, just to take the weight off of me , but I know when I wake up tomorrow, I am going to be really greatful for my past self, which decided to not give in.

Man I really know how yall are feeling, I know its so hard, but it gets better day by day, the first days were really strenous, but with every day that passes, I get stronger and stronger and get to choose what course my life is going to take.

&#x200B;

What did I learn in the first days ?: It´s hard, it is a battle, a war with your inner demons, but with every day you decide to not numb your feelings and thoughts, but to face your inner ""construction sites"" and to find ways to better them, the journey get´s easier and easier, and your future self will be really greatful for that, REALLY REALLY greatful.

&#x200B;

I know, living a sober and concious life seems really distant for somebody who is stuck in this cycle of smoke, sleep repeat. But even a week after you quit you will see some benefits, I 100% guarantee you that, just try sticking through it for at least 5 days and from there on compare yourself to your past self from day 1, how did you improve ? Take notes and I hope for all of you reading that life gets better, YOU get better, you will, everybody has the inner strenght, YOU want the best for YOU and only YOU can help YOU.

keep strong guys

I'm 24, almost 25. I started smoking when I was 16.  Back then, my friends and I made up a gram and that was enough for a long time.  We only smoked on the weekends.  Unfortunately, we were slowly getting lost in this stimulant.  We smoked more and more often.  Not only for weekends.  Around the age of 19-20, we seldom did it together.  Everyone took a gram or two and smoked on their own.  The biggest breakthrough was when I learned how to make blanks.  I was allowed to smoke in the house then, which turned out to be very bad.  Often I didn't see any reason to go out with friends, I could smoke alone.  From around the age of 21 I smoke almost every day.  I was desperately looking for smoking money from my parents.  I often lied to them and I am very sorry for that.  I missed my second year of college with MJ.  I went to work.  I even got good money and was already smoking a day.  A lot.  Today I am 24 years old.  5 days ago I moved to a dormitory because I am starting my second year of new studies.  I told myself that I had to end this forever.  The change of residence was supposed to help me with this.  And for now it helps!  5th day!  Record for several years!  1.2 days was normal.  On the third I felt depressed, angry at the world.  I saw no sense in anything.  Same thing on the fourth day.  Heavy Head.  I couldn't focus on anything.  I felt lost.  I have had some psychosis and felt  such pressure in my head.  Today I got up and as if taking a shower while sleeping.  I finally sweat it out.  I feel much better.  The head is lighter.  Clarity of mind is slowly coming back.  I want to fight on, I see the sense of it.  Finally, I have an appetite.  I even went to the gym to help support the process.  I am very pleased.  I'm not so muddled anymore.  Keep fingers crossed!

My greatest fear is that I have damaged my brain forever by starting to smoke at that age.  I do not know.  I will try to train my brain.

I am also foolish that since the age of 16, I really only counted herb.  We rarely went to parties with our friends, and what for.  Better to smoke in your own circle.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.960182785987854}"

3 days ago I had smoked a spliff for the first time in about 5 days and just after I got home after a stroll I laid down in bed and I was immediately hit with the most scary thing that’s ever happened to me. For context I have been waking up quite annoyed recently at friend problems and not being where I want to be in life (I’m 27) combined with losing my job due to Covid and money issues/debts. I avoided smoking for this reason as I know that any problems whilst smoking are enhanced by a thousand so I took a little break. On Thursday after playing football/soccer I got home had a wash and rolled one up. I went for a stroll and smoked the spliff and everything seemed okay... then I got home. I laid down and immediately all of these problems entered my brain at once causing me to start hyperventilating, sweating and shivering, feeling nauseous, intense headache and an overwhelming anxious feeling I could not shake. The most scary part about this was that it lasted all night and I could not shake this feeling away, I felt at that moment that you could have given me a million pounds and it wouldn’t of helped. I felt numb and depressed, feelings I have never ever felt before. I finally understood what some people go through 24/7. A feeling off constant fighting with yourself and never being able to escape your own thoughts.
I went into my mums room and told her about all my problems and laid down whilst she massaged my head and spoke to me calmly but at that moment I was scared that this was gonna be me for the rest of my life now, I would never be able to escape this feeling which I’ll be honest I don’t think I could handle if that was the case.

Fast forward to now a couple day’s later, I still have a pressure in my brain which feels like a headache but the thoughts that bothered me are nowhere near as dominant in my thoughts as that night. It put me off smoking weed for good, I never want to smoke it and feel like that again. In fact it was so intense I don’t even wanna see my friends again who caused me stress, I don’t even wanna be around weed no more because that feeling was an incite into what will happen if I carried on smoking. I needed to share this because it was so scary and I think people may benefit from this story. The moral of the story is don’t smoke if you have issues you need to deal with, it will enhance everything by a thousand and will really damage you. I pledge to never smoke weed again, I won’t demonise it but I can’t do that too my mental health again.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9928433299064636}"

I have been smoking since I was 13. Now I’m 24 and I have realized it is prohibiting my growth personally and spiritually. I am moderately successful in life. I am my own boss, I pay all my own bills have my own business, my own car, look good, eat good, exercise. 

However, I am not at my best version of myself. I know it. My biggest problems are social. I have friends but I could do better. I don’t talk to family enough even though we love each other. I am not going on many dates because I don’t really put myself out there enough. I don’t hang out really on the weekends that much. 

I want to start making leaps and feel like I’ve lost my way in life. Career-wise, I’m good. I’m talking socially and personally with friends and hobbies and such. I have some hobbies and things I’m good at, but not excellent at. I have a hard time pushing to excellence and tend to stop at “good.”

I quit smoking two weeks ago and I have really been feeling great. At first, the clarity was amazing. I felt more energy, too, and drive to be even more productive. However, I kind of bottomed out after about 10 days and now I’m feeling weird, like I have so far left to go and a little unmotivated. It’s funny I’m even less motivated at the moment than when I was smoking. 

I am not about to relapse because of this but if you can relate I would like to hear some of your stories on these feelings. Is it because I am feeling what’s underneath my external layer of emotion? Is this a common phase of recovery?

I've been smoking since high school. it's always been nice but I've discovered that smoking has made me unproductive, uncreative, and over all a little numb to the world around me. I've taken breaks here and there but i've never smoked as consistently and intensely as i have been for the past year. went through a break up in August of 2019 and took up smoking as a tool to help me deal. I started smoking every night and then a few times a day. after moving to the city I'd be smoking very consistently, multiple times a day, every day. well, I'm on day 10 of cold turkey quitting smoking for the first time in over a year and even though I have no cravings or had any problems quitting, I have begun to experience really bad migraines (or headaches idk). today at work around 11am out of nowhere I got this severe headache that just kept getting worse and worse. I don't think I've ever experienced such a bad one like this before. the day before I got one too around the same time , but not nearly as bad. today it was so bad I had to constantly close my eyes and press my temples for very little relief. I always avoid taking medication whenever I can but it was unbearable enough that I took an extra strength aspirin, which only worked for about 35 mins and then I had to take another one. the pain eventually faded but I feel it coming back right now. the intensity of the pain makes me a little worried so I've been trying to analyze any possible changes in my life in the last few days and the only the thing I can think of is my sobriety. Does quitting weed really have these kinds of withdrawals symptoms? I've been doing research but I can barely find anything that says it can be this bad. Has anybody experienced this? any information would be greatly appreciated as it will help me feel more at ease and less worried that there is something seriously wrong with me. any tips to deal with would also be great! thank you!

Started as a fun pastime and slowly turned into literally all day everyday. Vaped no less than 10 bowls a day. Was beginning to make me anxious and guilty, I wanted to quit for so long but always made an excuse to not. About six weeks ago I “quit” by throwing away what was left in my grinders. Then after a week or two I smoked the keif and the little baby bits left. Then I threw away the grinders themselves. Then I took an edible. Got super paranoid. Gave them away. That person gave me a mug in return, and my dumbass smoked it a few times a day for the next few days. It made me feel shitty, so I flushed the rest. I am now almost two weeks into not having anything, including alcohol. I am going through the hardest depression and anxiety I ever have these last two weeks. Plus insomnia with very vivid dreams, headaches, no appetite, nausea, I feel as though i am literally losing my mind. 

Long story short, what has helped any of you with withdrawals? What techniques did you employ, what did you read, what helped you get through this?

I used to draw all the time and had dreams of becoming an animator. I never thought I was addicted, even after I dropped out of highschool or stopped trying to socialize with others. Even when two years passed and I didn't put pen to paper once. Even when I spent hours scrolling social media mindlessly because I didn't even have the motivation to play a video game.

Weed made me live day-to-day. I didn't care about what happened yesterday or tomorrow, just getting high and floating away in slow-time bliss.

One day I had a horrifying and ugly moment of clarity. I had become what I never wanted to be when I was younger. My child self would be ashamed of my habits and my lifestyle. I cried over all my wasted time - but I realized it's not too late.

Nobody is going to look out for you the way you look out for yourself. I decided I was quitting, because I didn't want to die all the time anymore and maybe there was something better out there for me. I also had nobody in my life that was going to tell me to quit. I had to tell myself. But it was hard.

I tried it three times over before realizing why I couldn't stop - I didn't want to. I don't know what makes this time different, it just feels right. It's the longest I've been clean cold turkey. Nothing in my life has drastically changed except my mindset. I was ready to realize my potential. Maybe this is something many people have experienced. An ""Aha!"" moment.

2020-10-10 00:35:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/j8eajx/smoking_just_to_live/,Smoking just to live,"Dear Redditors,

I (24m) have been smoking pot since i was 19 .
It all started as a pain relief back when i lost a very dear friend to a stupid accident and I've been hooked ever since.
 It went from party smoking to 1G a day real quick and I haven't been able to stop for more than a week or two and to be frank that only happens if I'm short on cash or there is no dealer to be found . 

Weed is my drug of choice and i used to enjoy every second of being high . Hell , even boring chores were fun and relaxing under the influence but for the past couple of months every time that i take the first hit an immense amount of guilt and displeasure kicks in and I don't even smoke my spliff to the end but when i am indeed out of weed i start panicking and all i can think about is how where and when to get some more because i feel like shit , can't sleep and can't even get myself to get out of the God damn bed in the morning if I know that there is no weed to come back to once I'm back from school . 

I started this school year knowing fully that it's a very important one with big exams that i can not fuck up so i decided i would only smoke during the weekends or when i got a lighter day ahead of me and enough time to sleep , it worked out or atleast i thought it did untill the pandemic hit the planet and i had this 5-6 months of isolation just staying in and blazing it up , this led to me being completely out of it once my school started again and missed so many classes that i got into big trouble and had to face concequences . 

I know that weed is the main cause of my laziness and over all the source of my anxiety , depression and heavy mood swings but i just can't imagine myself without being able to smoke  .
I moarn for a good night sleep and i miss dreaming but I'm also terrified of the sleepness nights and the nightmares that follow when I don't smoke....
It's been 2 years since i cut contact with all my friends except for one (which i see maybe once a month and it's always him showing up on my doorstep) and been in a relationship cause I've been too busy getting straight home to my window to roll up blaze up and waste my time either  on endless games ,videos or music .

My dad is addicted to opium and I've been around that my whole life as well so my parent's don't give any ultimatums and i can freely smoke at home without getting into trouble . 

I'm terrified of becoming a loser pothead still living with his parents doing entry level jobs and ending up with a bellow average life but i can't seem to kick the habbit cause everytime i stop there is this urge this cunning little fucking voice in my head that tells me that it's just for the weekend or that man life is pointless we all gonna die anyway so just smoke up cuz i know that you love it . 

I had a joint just 1 hour ago and I'm about to have my next one when I'm finished writing this , i know that I'm never going to stop smoking it as long as i have some on me and i know that no one can help me except for me but I've been literally just breathing and not living for the past year , day to day hoping to just die in a way that is not sucide because i couldn't do that to my parent's , not when they sacreficed everything for me and moved to a new country for me to have a better life and a better future but i feel stuck .
I hate weed and i love it , it's a source of my depression on one side but a reliefer on the other and it really seems impossible to get away from . 

Please wise and kind people of reddit give me wisdom and knowledge .

We all know we can’t smoke pot. We all know there is no moderating.

I’ve gone back to it so many times, the escape of a good joint. But you always want more.

It’s funny how people say it’s not addictive, I have been acting like a junkie, spending all of my money on pot, neglecting friends, relationships, letting the paranoia change my whole perception of reality.

I’ve quit so many times I actually feel like I’m slowly learning how to quit at last.

There’s just one quote that is keeping me going.

You either learn the pain of discipline, or the pain of regret. The only difference is discipline weighs ounces and regret weighs tonnes.

I’m twenty. Already this habit has ripped my life apart and I’ve had to keep putting it back together, life has enough obstacles to over come, why have I been adding this needless addiction on top of it all?

I just want to feel the pain, to feel the exhaustion.
I’m sick of running away.
I’m sick of being stoned.

I lost my job, so that made the decision way easier, my 401k plan didn't call to tell me that a loan I took out wasn't able to be taken out because I was let go....which freaked me out because I am moving next week. I had to expedite my withdrawal and take a bigger hit  on my taxes but that's OK.  Then my grandmother died last Saturday. The funeral home didn't have the Dr sign the papers for her cremation so we held the memorial without her present. Just photos. Very aggravating about whoever screwed up. My cousin, who is a minister held the service and did a wonderful job. Now Sunday we can bury her ashes next to my grandfather, although that was supposed to take place Wednesday. 

Oh and I'm an idiot as well about school. I hit take quiz to see what kind of camera I needed. Apparently you had to take it then and there, no camera and I  was not prepared and had to run my dog to the vet for more medicine fifteen minutes after hitting that button. The dog has a yeast infection in both ears and this was her second dose of medicine. So my midterm was 0, as it stands now. I emailed my professor this morning and still haven't heard back from her if I can try and retake it. Otherwise I have an f currently, when I used to be a straight a student. I hope she will help me, but I know I can raise it to a c if push comes to shove.

I don't. Mean to toot my own horn, but I'm proud I haven't smoked. I have really wanted to at times but kept reading or watching to TV to distract. I'm in therapy to help me learn to cope with the problems that made me want to smoke in the first place. And to be honest I realized something about myself and said it out loud to my therapist about feeling inferior. It never dawned on me but that is how I feel around my friends and family. So realizing that and going through those uncomfortable emotions have been rough this week as well. This has been one of the hardest years of my life, not including covid. And I'm happy to be trying to cope in a healthy way. I'm happy to have this group and the discord channel to talk to everyday. I know I'm in therapy, but it works wonders talking to others in your same situation.

I wish you all the best, wherever you are in your journey. If it's day one or a relapse or two years later, you are strong for making the change in yourself you want to. Not many people can do that. Remember to be kind to yourself. That is one the things getting me through this rough time. Instead of wallowing in self pity, I'm understanding I'm not perfect and that's OK, as long as I learn from my mistakes and try my best.

Again thank you for all of you here who are so supportive. Good luck to all of you on your journeys, and bless you with whatever higher power you believe in or don't.",6,"{'infect': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9663573503494263}"

For as long as I can remember weed has been a big part of my life and there’s been many months where I’d do smoke every single day. 

Weed definitely hasn’t ruined my life or anything, its been more of a blessing and a curse. I graduated 2 years ago with a degree in computer science but was unfortunately laid off due to COVID a few months ago from my first software engineering job out of college. Since then weed has slowly crept more and more into my daily life.

It got to the point where I was taking hits from my bong every day and while it wasn’t as bad as when I was dabbing multiple times a day in college, I could still feel its effects on my mind and especially my lungs.

I decided to buy myself a nice vaporizer a month ago which definitely helped me feel a bit healthier. However, even vaping is still bad for you and so two weeks ago I switched to purely doing edibles. However, I’ve now been unemployed for about 4 months and am not receiving as much unemployment funds from the government as I once was.

I need to start taking my career and health more seriously and for this reason I decided to stop doing even edibles last weekend. It’s been nearly a week and I can feel my brain starting to get sharper and my body having more energy. Hopefully soon I’ll get my life back on track and I’ll find a job I love.

Decided to finally take a break and stop smoking for a while. I've realized my THC intake was out of control and that it just wasn't good for my body.

When I stopped at the beginning of this week, I started experiencing CWS (cannabis withdrawal symptoms). Stuff like loss of appetite/fcked up appetite. Throwing up or having a feeling of nausea/ vomiting sensation after almost every meal. Struggling to sleep and getting cold sweats out of nowhere. Having to deal with phlegm build up in my throat. It really feels like I have like a stomach infection or something but it's just my body reacting negatively to this sudden change of stopping weed for some reason. I'm not sure why. I've asked some of my friends who smoke very frequently as well and they haven't experienced something like this before. Maybe it's just me..

The craving for weed hasn't really been there. It's just mainly these symptoms that I've been dealing with.

I know that it's just the process my body has to go through to release all the toxins and stuff and get my system functioning back to normal.

So I told the group that I would bin my stash before this morning’s group. Now I feel panicked about it. It’s obvious that part of me has not fully committed to quitting. Part of me is in denial.

I work as a teller at a bank making a decent wage but it’s not enough for me to be financially free. I am living paycheck to paycheck, paying bills hurts, I can only save $300 a check and not touch the rest if not im fucked. My parents live with me, my dad is losing his vision, has hypertension, and is slowly becoming weaker. My mom is working but its not consistent work, she helps around the house mostly. My job is super fucking boring, we aren’t even allowed to play music which is a big thing for me. I’ve been working there since the end of May and I dread waking up. Its 1:32 AM right now and I’m supposed to be at work at 9:15 when its at 40 minute drive. I really miss smoking. The stress of me feeling like a complete fucking failure is getting to me. I’m making $2200 a month after taxes which isn’t shit in the US. My monthly expenses alone are $1650 not including food or gas. I literally feel like I’m just scraping by and it pisses me the fuck off thinking about it. The worst part is that this is my highest paying job ever and because of my expenses I can’t afford to leave. Have I thought of going to school? Yes, but it would take me a year just to pay ONE SEMESTER of school. I don’t even know what I want to study or do in my life. I quit smoking because I was hurting my mom emotionally and mentally and I hurt me know that. Its been 11 days and today, right now I feel like crying and wish all I could do is smoke a fat ass joint and forget. I want to make happiness my #1 priority in life but Im a hypocrite because if this was true to me, I would not accept where I am right now, but I have and I hate it. I don’t want to work, I don’t want to get up in the morning to do the same fucking bullshit and hand entitled assholes their thousands of dollars while im over here accepted into a system of workforce slavery. I want to have FUN and get PAID TO HAVE FUN. Why is that so fucking hard to do in this life? I wish I could have a form of passive income like having many properties and rent them out and never work a day in my life again but to do that you meed a whole fucking HEAP of money. I feel angry at myself because I know deep down I am worth MORE and can do MORE but the issue I have is that I am essentially trading my time: my life for a mediocre entry level job with slightly better salary than minimum wage. I want to make movies, I want to race cars, I want to study physics and become a physicist. I don’t know how people chose to one thing to do forever. I cannot, I refuse and I reject that. I want to help people but not in this shitty bullshit way. I don’t know what to do. I only have my highschool degree and theres mot many jobs out there that pay more than $20/hr as an entry level job that’s FUN. I really want to smoke my mind away and just forget and not feel. Please, I really need help. I need advice. I need guidance. I have nowhere else to go for help.

Edit: Just want to thank all of you guys showing love and understanding. I did not smoke and don’t plan to. When I read all of the comments I couldn’t help but cry. Life is hard as hell and thats it. You guys really helped me see why I started this in the first place and even though I wanted to smoke my mind and emotions away, I realize now that it is better to just go through my emotions and actually FEEL. I guess I’m just getting used to my mind sobering up. Im going to start taking action and actually try. Try to get myself out of this situation but picking up something to study and strive for, something worth while. You are the kindest, wisest, and most compassionate folks I’ve ever come into contact with and I am eternally grateful for the kind and uplifting words. In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength. I am strong and I will do it, I will keep pushing, and I will become better.

Ended my 1st year of college w/ a 1.7 gpa and a lot of wasted money. Felt like my life was falling apart, which gave me more motivation to quit. Luckily it stuck, and now I love being sober. I haven't craved weed in forever.

Since I've gotten sober I've found a deep passion for science and math. I was already interested in these subjects, but now its something I willingly learn about everyday, even outside my classes. With all this acquired knowledge, I find myself really enjoying being able think clearly about random things I've learned. If im  bored somewhere, I'm able to ponder and think about different aspects of our universe, physics, or math, and i love being able to do that. Its something I could never do while high.

Since my first year of college ended awfully, I've been terrified of checking my grades, and today for the 1st time, I checked them. I honestly thought I was still failing all my classes, but it turns out I'm doing great. Got an 86 on my calc 2 test (which I really thought I had severely failed, even though I had studied more than I ever have for a test), I got an 80 on my history test, and a 98 on my programming test! It feels so great to finally be succeeding in college.

A little over a year ago was the last time I smoked weed. 

It was a terrible cycle. I smoked, or wanted to smoke, every single night. I planned my days around having free time to smoke at night. The worst part is that I lied about it. I lied to myself and I lied to my significant other. I was convinced it wasn't a big deal. If I was braver, or perhaps more emotionally mature, I would have admitted to it. But instead I insisted that I only did it because I had the free time to do so, and because it wasn't affecting me in any negative ways.

Reality was the exact opposite. The weed itself wasn't the problem. I truly believe that weed is great for those that can handle it. But I had made weed an idol in my life. All my thoughts revolved around manipulating the events of my day so that I would be able to smoke in the evening. Not only did I manipulate events, but people too, namely my significant other. I used weed to escape from tough situations. It had become the only thing I looked forward to every day. My significant other, my friends, my hobbies, my mental wellbeing - it all became less and less important.

The worst part is how I allowed myself to stunt my growth as a human being. I was not becoming a better person when I got high. Being high makes everything seem ok. It means I don't have to think about the things that are hard in my life. I don't have to learn to deal with hardships, or confront pain, or manage my emotions. My character becomes stagnant, and that is not how it is supposed to be. I should consider trails and hardships as joy. As people endure trails and persevere, they build character, they become more mature, and they become more complete. Weed keeps this essential character growth from taking place.

This complacency in my life bred terrible consequences. My significant other and I had conflict, and I wasn't taking responsibility. There is so much I needed to do differently, but instead I prioritized getting high. I became ok with my actions, and my actions were not ok. Conflict was becoming more frequent, it was largely my fault, yet I took no responsibility. How could I? I gave myself zero time to sit with my emotions and process them. So there I was, living a life full of conflict and being convinced that it wasn't my fault. Can you guess what that means? It means I blamed my significant other. My weed problems were out of control, causing me to blame the love of my life for my own problems. And worse than blaming my SO...is that I lashed out my SO constantly.

It all culminated a year ago. Conflict got too bad. My eyes opened, finally. I had to stop.

I have not struggled with physical cravings. It's not like that, at least not for me. I just miss smoking weed. I long for a reality where can I use it sparingly, not as a twisted idol that allows me to ignore life like how I used to use it, but just for the simple fun of smoking on a peaceful walk at night while thinking up hilarious ideas. I miss that. I know I've lost all right to ever smoke weed again. I've proven to myself that I'm irresponsible and that I can't trust myself, yet I still find myself missing it all the time. I feel like I've lost a friend. I constantly wonder whether I'll ever be able to try smoking again. I shared this thought with my significant other recently. I was so scared to do so. I thought my SO would be upset with me for secretly wanting to smoke again, given how much pain I caused in the past. I was so scared to hear that. But instead my SO thanked me for sharing this feeling, empathized with me, and said that this is something for us to continue thinking about as the months and years go by. I truly do not deserve this person in my life.

I am so glad I am not the person I was a year ago. If you've come this far, then please don't get turned off by hearing me say that it is 100% to God's glory that He began opening my eyes to my sin in October 2019. It wasn't my doing. I was content living in my ignorant denial. But God is real, God is merciful, and God never gives up on His children.

**There are two things I've learned in the last year that really stand out to me:**

(1) Hardships have to be confronted. We all become better and stronger people by persevering, not by avoiding. The easy way out - whether it is weed, alcohol, working, TV, video games, or anything else - stunts character growth. Whatever it is that you are avoiding, I challenge you to stop running. And trust me, I know it can be hard and even terrifying. The last year of my life has been a living hell. That's what I get for avoiding my problems for so long! But I can tell you with honesty and integrity that it is worth it to do so. We all have different feelings we avoid confronting. End of the day, we are all running from taking responsibility for ourselves and our actions. Don't be scared to seek therapy, especially if you've suffered from trauma.

(2) This may be more specific to my situation, but I urge you all to be honest and consider how big a problem your smoking habit is. Here are some things I wish I knew earlier. If you primarily look forward to getting high again, it is a problem. If you schedule your life around having time to get high, it is a problem. If you get frustrated when you lose an opportunity to get high, it is a problem. If you are disingenuous to someone about how often you smoke or why you want to smoke, even if you think you have a good reason for doing so, it is a problem. If you sober up and regret getting high, it is a problem. If you get high and never process negative feelings, it is a problem.

I live in a state where it's completely illegal. I come from a pretty strict household where my parents would never be ok with me smoking. My brother and sister are both weed smokers and I think moved out to smoke freely. I chose to stay living at home because I like not having the freedom of rolling and smoking whenever I please. I would spend most my hours smoking in parks in my car. Recently, smoking in a secluded street, 7pm, just a casual Monday after work. My black car has tinted black windows (looks suspicious, but just my style). I knew I shouldn't of rolled the street looked so quite. I'm rolling a joint and the next thing I see is another black car. 2 guys get out of the car and demand I get out. I was high as fuck. It was undercover cops and I was shaking from head to toe. I immediately stepped out of my hot-boxed car (smoke blowing out everywhere) and started crying. They told me it's fine since my records clear and I was using the weed recreationally not selling and that I should just smoke it at home. They actually felt bad for me because they knew I had so much potential with a masters degree, I felt bad for myself. They let me off with a cannbis warning and I caught an Uber home. Even after that experience I still didn't quit. I've been smoking for a year and a half. Recently an ounce a week (28 grams) and cost me around 1000 a month. It's such a joke, you start with a 20, 50, then quarter, then ounce and before you know it your life's a mess. last weekend, I took a trip alone for 3 days and took MJ with me. I basically sat in that house smoking all day. I realised, ""wow, in my own space, this is all that I am"", this experience is so boring and taking yourself out of an environment really makes a difference. You realise that you're just conditioned to smoke, and taking yourself out of the normal space makes such a difference. So I didn't quit on the trip. When I got back home, today, I threw it all out. It feels so weird, the truth is, you need to die before you die and realise there is no death. I think I certainly felt my heart drop when the bin slammed shut after I threw my shit. Literally like a part of me left my soul. I died inside but there is no such thing, we must kill addiction inside us to realise that we are always going to be addicted to a man, a thing, an object, before we really look inside ourselves. We are all afraid of death (especially the ego), but to die now in this way is better than to die knowing we were high. Wish me luck",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9776591658592224}"

Pretty much daily, with only the few scattered breaks that involved business travel, an impending drug test, etc.  And those scattered breaks were long ago.  In this time I've married (twice), had a family, started a business, divorced (twice), even achieved a high rank in a martial art.  All that while I was stoned.  I wouldn't smoke before a workday or a training class, but the moment I entered my door I was firing up.  I'm quite sure I haven't missed a day in the last decade.  I turn 50 in a week or so and am starting to think that maybe it's time to call it a day.  

In a sense I've done reasonably well, I have a decent home, a nice car.  I felt there was no reason to stop, but I'm painfully aware at the confusion and disappointment I caused many times when I wouldn't participate in... well, things I should have participated in.  I'm concerned about the withdrawal.  I'm also concerned about the ocean of reality that I'm apparently going to be confronted with.  I truly don't know a life un-stoned.  I was a teenager the last time I had that level of awareness, and now for the first time ever I really know with no doubt that I'm not a young man anymore.  

Practically 100% of the time I 'smoke', I smoke alone.  Been that way daily for 3 years since my wife (a smoker and alcoholic like me) moved out.  So there's no socialization involved.  None.  The last 20 years have gone by in a flash, and they haven't been pretty.  I think of my poor children that suffered at my stoned decisions.  My relationship with my oldest son is very terrible.  And all those coworkers and friends I repeatedly let down.  I'm certainly not that guy you can count on.  I'm a selfish, socially inept, addict that has finally painted himself into a corner and can't pretend this is fun or what life was supposed to be.  As I mentioned I also have an alcohol problem, going into my 2nd week sober after a mostly daily unhealthy amount of alcohol (but that's another story).  So pot is all I have.  I can't even imagine a life without it.  

And that's all I have to say.  I can count on one hand the people that even know I smoke, so there's really no one I can say all this to, and this seems to be the place to say this sort of thing.

I'm now in my Junior year and I want to make a change. Last November I again tried to stop (or slow) my weed intact and I managed to succeed. I managed to stop smoking for November but soon began again in mid-December following the end of finals. I was extremely apprehensive to begin smoking again and for the most part* I was ""under control"". After December, I no longer smoked during the week, only on weekends but the beginning of every new week would feel like hell. I would basically be feeling all the symptoms of withdrawal from mon-wed. then my body would adjust and I would smoke again at that weekend. However, ""the weekend"" soon began to start on Fridays and when COVID hit in march, consumption increased dramatically and I feel like I'm worse off than before. These last ~8 months feel like a blur. I'm tired of what Marijuana is doing to me and my social life. I feel dependent and trapped. I no longer want to feel stuck in place. 

I don't want to fail again but I'm worried I'll fall back into similar patterns. I live with 2 other guys and we all smoke.

I listened to the lyrics, obsorbing the screams onto my philosophical mind and find profound meaning in many of my favorite songs. The music was angry and depressed so that I wouldn't have to be. I always used to rule the mosh pit at concerts and let the breakdowns obsorb the pain of being punched and kicked. Metal music was my source of inspiration and joy, and I saw the beauty in the darkness. I understood every word that was screamed and growled like it was a second language.

I started smoking weed a little more than a year ago. Each night I would roll off my THC vape cart and chill out and listen to metal. However, only after recently quitting I've realized that I wasn't able to understand the words of many of my favorite songs, and listening new songs, it was impossible to understand the lyrics were without googling them. I think I drifted away from metal music because of that. The poetry and meaning of songs became a blur in the unintelligible screams. I lost one of the very things that truly connected with me.. as if the language part of my brain that was fluent in screaming erased itself while high.

Yesterday I took a walk to help clear my mind, and decided to explore some Killswitch albums with my buds in. (I never was really into KSE before)
Suddenly that poetry came back. It was like Howard was screaming into my soul, telling me to wake up from whatever I'm currently not able see. I felt inspiration again. It felt like getting off my highschool bus. 

Now that I'm sober, bits and pieces of who I truly am and was before are coming back to me, each one giving me hope that I will be able to meet myself again. Im glad I see how much weed fucked me up. Im glad knowing how much time I wasted being high and the people I pushed away, because now I have an adventure ahead of me. The more negative my realizations get, the prouder I feel of myself quitting. Darkness is truly beautiful and this community has helped me SO much.

If any of you are currently struggling with withdrawal, please let your inner conscience know that the pain you suffer through now will make you so much stronger in the future. Soon you'll look back to the battle you're fighting today and it will be one of the proudest, most memorable times of your life. You will thank yourself and know that your pride is well-earned. 

Struggle is the greatest mentor. Love you all.

A little background: I’m 28 and have had an unhealthy relationship with weed for the past five or six years. I’ve tried quitting but always experienced the same withdrawal symptoms that you’ll see time and time again in these posts: anxiety, depression, insomnia. My biggest struggle was with insomnia and because of it, I could never truly leave weed in the rear view mirror.

My story is one anecdote but at a certain point, I said enough is enough and sought medical help. I first tried to manage this through my primary care but after a few months of continue to struggle to fall asleep, I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. Our initial conversation comprised of me sharing my history with marijuana and my struggle with sleep since trying to quit. He immediately recommended I stop following the advice of my primary care and has worked with me and given me the tools to finally get past the challenges. I’m not going to share which medications were used bc I think there is a tendency for those of struggling with this to internalize our struggle or only reach out to our support networks (this subreddit included) for emotional support. All I can say is that there are professionals that are uniquely positioned to provide us with the tools to overcome the withdrawal symptoms and live the life we’re trying to by quitting. I know not everyone has the financial means or insurance to pursue these but all I know is that if I would have kept trying to manage this myself, I’d likely still be struggling and relapsing.

 I'm sure I missed a lot, and would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! For those lurkers thinking about quitting, and people who feel like they may cave, I really hope this helps! 

**The Great** 

* Don’t need to hide your addiction from people you love 
* If you smoke your weed, your lungs will thank you 
* You become a more dependable to friends and family 
* Saving a stupid amount of money (\~$60/week for me) 
* You wake up feeling well rested and can wake up earlier
* Eventually all the negatives of quitting will disappear (even if it takes time), and all the positives will still be there!

**The Good** 

* You find new hobbies and having more time in general
* Feeling more in control of your life  
* You will eat healthier (no munchies) 
* Within weeks, you will notice your memory improve 
* If you live somewhere weed’s illegal, not having the fear of legal ramifications  
* Having dreams again 
* Finding more meaningful relationships  
* You smell better/ look better & no more black circles around eyes 
* Quitting does something for your self-respect 
* A lot of people realize they have underlying health issues masked by smoking weed, and only notice once they quit (from what I’ve seen on this sub) 
* Quitting does something for your self-respect and esteem
* Having more emotional range  (may not seem good, but god dammit it's what makes us human <3)

**The Bad** 

* The boredom (especially if you use to get high to get things done) 
* When you first quit, you may have troubles eating/sleeping 
* Looking back at everything you lost because of weed and feeling like a loser 
* Some good/great outcomes may take longer for you to experience 
* Feeling left out as you watch others smoke  
* Feeling regret for the time you lost 

**The Ugly**  

* You must face trauma/hardship that you were trying to escape with weed  
* Random moments where you feel sad/lonely  
* Some people experience bad/ugly outcomes for years, and there's no way to know when negative symptoms will stop.
* There may be people who are supportive, but you need to distance from because they also have a problem 
* Having night terrors again (if applicable) 
* Stomach pains and throwing up 
* Being kind of an asshole when you first quit",39,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8654887676239014}"

Shit I picked up heavily since my wife left a few months ago and have found myself with nothing left.. it was nice at first as I found the escape enticing but the escape seems to become avoidance tactics wrapped in saintly robes..
I really enjoy the highs as it helps make my ASD much easier to cope and manage.. though at the cost of my motivation and will power.. sometimes I wanna stay stoned stupid to try and forget her and the pain but I know that i need to process completely and this is a temporary bandaid..
Smokes since I was 16.. on and off with breaks of course am 30 now.. 
have stopped over the years and pickup usually out of boredom(which I have embraced):. 
I guess I’m really not looking for the withdrawals, I don’t want to have to deal with them and I live with someone who smokes regularly and has no plans of stopping he firmly believes and this is his quote:” life sucks and then you die, so fuck the world let’s all get high!”

Now part of me wants to do that and just opt out of society go full hippie and live off the land.. 
yet I want a companion again eventually(when I get through this limbo hell while I wait for the filings..)
So yeah I guess to make something of myself as I have no career I like to think I am decently intelligent.
I have wanted to get into coding and web dev for the longest..(cannot even afford a laptop so I have been reading coding books on my phone(well working through my first still on eloquent JavaScript)..
Anyways yeah Mary Jane and I have had one hell of a relationship but I think today may be quitting day.. though i was in Colorado and again am worried I will have a high tolerance and shit..

I'd been smoking a bit in the morning before work, and then in the evening I'd light up pretty much all the time until I went to bed. The problem was that I never actually went to bed, I'd just smoke another one and another one - to the point where I'd pass out at 3-4 am, and obviously woke up really late - 10-11 am.  This didn't affect my work, I could just get there when I wanted and get the job done. No one at work had noticed a thing. I didn't smoke at work, so I had about 8 hours of day without smoking, and at the end of day I just couldn't wait to get home and smoke.

Then came Covid.

I started working from home, so even during work hours I'd smoke. I would smoke before I brushed my teeth. Before (zoom) meetings, after meetings, and when there was no video, during meetings. Before eating, after eating.

At some point I realized I was smoking weed as if it was cigarettes. It stopped affecting me - I was never stoned or high. I was just smoking as a habit, out of boredom. I had forgotten what being high was like. 

For the last 6 months since this shit storm started, I've been smoking almost 3 grams a day. Weed is pretty cheap where I live, and I can afford it so it didn't bother me financially. 

All of my friends are heavy smokers, but even they couldn't believe me when I mentioned how much I smoke. Truth be told, even I couldn't believe it.

About 3 weeks ago I decided that I was going to stop smoking alone - and only do it with my friends, during the evenings. The amount I was smoking caused me to panic. Every month I would buy more than the previous month. Much more.

It was one of the hardest things I could do, because literally everything I did involved smoking. I couldn't imagine waking up and not smoke right away. Go through a work day (at home) without smoking was really a crazy thought for me. 

But I did it anyway. And after 2 days I had realized - I CAN'T EAT. anything. My body just wouldn't take food, it was used to smoke before food. I only managed to eat at evening, after smoking.

I was experiencing heavy weed withdrawal. I came here and read some stuff, to understand what was going on, and at that point decided I need to stop smoking altogether, because my body is messed up and i'm driving it crazy.

I actually got really excited about the possibility of completely stopping. And at that point it became so easy. I literally cut the habit in a second.

I haven't smoked since, even though I'm around smokers every single day (all of my friends). It just doesn't bother me anymore. 

So it's really easy now - I don't think about drugs at all. I don't even mind when my friends smoke next to me. I can go thought a work day without even looking at my stash (which I kept at home, just because I wanted to see that I'm stronger than that).

But my body doesn't like it as much as I do. It took about a week without smoking to be able to eat again. I think I lost 2 kg during that first week. Now my appetite is back to normal.

Then came tension headaches. I'm suffering from that as I write this post, and i'm on pain killers.

My doctor didn't know what it was about, I did a CT which showed nothing abnormal. Then I read here that some of you had the same symptoms so it calmed me down a bit.

Now i'm just waiting for it to pass - i guess it can take a few more weeks but I really don't mind it that much. If at all, these withdrawal symptoms only make me more motivated to keep clean. I can't believe I messed up my body this much and i'm so happy I managed to change my mind about it.

I want to thank everyone in this community who share their stories, it was really great for me to know others share some of the stuff I've been going through.

they were crushed over and over, because of weed.

i lost my best friend during the withdrawal when i quit, just when i thought it couldnt get worse.

2020-10-08 02:41:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/j789pg/checked_in_on_this_sub_after_500_days_sober_and/,Checked in on this sub after 500+ days sober and felt a ton of old emotions.,"I quit smoking weed on May 27th 2019. I had wanted to quit for a while. I'd tried maybe 100+ times to quit before, but I had never been successful. Sometimes, after deciding ""today is the day"" in the morning, I would be smoking again by that evening. Living across the street from a dispensary didn't help at all.

I decided to go out for a sober walk in the morning and it hit me. My mind was wandering and I started to think of my weed use. All of a sudden there was a deep part of me asking myself how much I smoked. To truly be honest with myself, and really face how much I smoked, cut me to my core. I painfully admitted to myself that I could easily smoke over half an ounce of flower a week, with a weed vape pen mixed in for good measure. I was a shell of myself, and it left me more alone than I had ever been. I completely broke down standing there on the street. I walked home and never touched the stuff again.

All my willpower in the world couldn't get me out of it. When it comes to addiction, willpower often fails. For me, it took an unplanned snap to break me out of addiction. It was only after that snap that I could summon the willpower to be sober. Don't get me wrong, there's still a part of me that wants to smoke, and it rears it's ugly head sometimes. But I know I can't go back to that old life. It would destroy me. This is where the willpower kicks in.

I wish I could say that now that I'm sober, I'm absolutely kicking ass at life. But honestly, life is pretty average. It's far better than it was don't get me wrong. I have so many wonderful and positive things that have come from sobriety, but I still suffer from loneliness and depression. And that's okay.

Being sober won't fix all of your problems, but it allows you to really experience a real depth of life. There's richness in those moments where I'm enjoying a TV show sober. And in a weird way, there's something beautiful about feeling lonely, sitting in my bed at night. I can't explain it well, but weed was holding me back from feeling the full spectrum of experience. In feeling it all, I find myself much more content.

I see people here posting about just starting their sobriety. I see myself in these posts. I remember what it was like to make it three days sober, and heavily relapse. I remember going on trips without weed, coming back, and smoking myself into a stupor. I see many posts on this sub just dripping with guilt and self-loathing, and I *deeply* know what it feels like to be there.

To my friends in this community who are on the journey, I know your struggle. Reading your posts reminds me of how I once felt. The text of this post isn't enough to even begin to explain how much I care, and how much I'm rooting for you. I truly and honestly believe that you, yes ***you***\*,\* will see this road through the end. Sobriety won't fix all your problems, but if you pay attention, sobriety makes life significant, and sacred to it's core.

You have all my love. I wish you more than luck.

Having the mental capacity to *try* and do things is amazing. Am I working 8 hours a day, reading, exercising, studying for the CPA, and talking to girls? No. I did work for 5 hours today, worked on this presentation for work that has been giving me anxiety, went for a 3 mile walk, hit bicep watching the debate and now I'm about to play Warzone. 

When I was high, I'd have like 2 hours to accomplish shit then the rest of the day is gone. 

There is not enough time in the day to do everything you ought to be doing in your life. Just map it out. I want to excercise daily, meditate, read, work, learn a new skill, study, watch tv, play games. There isn't enough time in a day to do all that unless I really manage my time and stay diligent. It's possible and I'll get there, but instead of doing 10%, I'm now doing 60%. Over time it will get better. 

You do not have the right to be depressed about your situation if you sit at home like a stoner zombie and accomplish nothing. Seriously. How can you want and expect and do 0 work to achieve it? It makes no sense.

I was studying Law in 2014 and then exchanged to Psychology and I was already behind my classmates but now with the pandemic I won’t graduate very soon and now I have no job, no college for a while (the whole year basically) and Brazil is going through a recession (yes I am Brazilian) and everybody is kinda screwed. 
And even though I have enough money to do therapy and deal with it, I still feel stuck on the habit, even tho I understand the whys and what to do to change. 

Im doing exercises, ended a relationship based on addiction and codependence , take meds for moods and depression, use essencial oils, yoga, meditation, am trying to get a job as a tutor also doing online  courses but there’s this impulse, this emptiness that has to be fulfilled, if not for weed is food, or sex, or technology. 
But with weed I want all the time, I start to feel panic when I don’t smoke for 2 days and I do everything high mostly, it’s a reinforcement for each accomplishment or pain experienced. 

I don’t even get high since I’m always high, I smoke about 5/6 joints a day and also with friends since 2017 when I felt a big psychological trauma.
Changing is hard and it is scary to face who you’re going to be as an adult. 
24 years and I get so ashamed of it all, still can’t stop, I feel as same as I felt with seventeen and it is sucks.

What if there is no better version of this? Is this the best I can be? My parents are excepcional beings very hard working and intelligent and I feel like a failure, as if when prefer I didn’t exist deep inside. 
I though I would be a writer, an artist, a good psychologist, an explorer and lover of life, a true bon vivant, but now I feel incapable.

I am 26. I've been smoking since I was 17. A few times a week socially. I went to college and started smoking near daily with my roommate who had been a daily smoker for a couple years at this point. Near the end of my sophomore year we started mixing weed and tobacco (either paper as spliffs or in a bong as ""mokes"") and I became a daily user. The initial rush of euphoria from the bong rip followed by the complete empty-headedness was a nice reprieve from school stress and divorcing parents.

I did fine in school and graduated. I lived at home for a year and got a job that could support an apartment, social life, and smoking habit. At this point I was moking everyday, multiple times a day but always at night after I had completed my day. I was no longer using the gym regularly and put on 50lbs that I had lost in high school initially. I had no real long term career aspirations, although I was doing fine in my work everyday and even getting promotions. But it was a dead end I knew that deep down. I've been in that job for four years now.

Over the past four years I've quit cold turkey maybe a half dozen times. Each time is spurred by a deep dissatisfaction with the direction of my life. I thought I would have achieved more, or lost weight, or read more books, or had some clue about the direction of my life and goals. I throw out the tobacco and weed, put away the bong, and struggle for the first two weeks. During those two weeks I would feel a deep emptiness, like my life didn't matter if I wasn't obliterated at the end of the day. But that feeling would subside and I would feel great - clear head, no morning fogginess, more motivation. This lasts for maybe 2-4 months and then I start getting that itch to moke again. A bad day inevitably hits and I pick up more tobacco and weed and pull out the bong and make all the stress of that day fade away. It becomes a routine again - come home, make sure my basic needs are met, and then moke the rest of the night. In another 4-6 months the dissatisfaction returns and I start over.

I'm working through this in therapy right now. I quit 2 months ago and started feeling very depressed 2 weeks after. I started taking anti-depressants and, now that I'm feeling better, am getting the itch to smoke again. I recognize that to do the work I need to do in therapy, I cannot be high and I'm okay with that. But I hold onto the notion that once I'm on the other side, once I've worked through the road blocks keeping me from achieving the potential I know I have, I'll be able to have a healthy relationship with weed. That fact that I have weed in my room and have abstained reinforces the notion that I'm not addicted to weed and that I just need to deal with the underlying issues and I'll be free to smoke in moderation. But the pattern I laid out above tells a different story.

This post might be me struggling to admit that I am addicted and should get rid of the notion that on the other side I will be able to have a healthy relationship with weed. That it's the tobacco that really forms the unhealthy relationship, I tell myself. I'm not sure what to think.

I've been looking at r/leaves since the beginning of the year, long before I was willing to admit to myself that I actually need to quit. It's almost like my unconscious mind knew I was going to have to get sober in 2020. My story with weed goes like this:

I was terrified of weed (and all other recreational drugs) ever since I was a child. At the same time, I was fascinated. It scared the shit out of me and intrigued me at the same time. The idea of smoking a substance to get out of your brain for a little while was terrifying to me. I told myself that I would be the last person to ever try it.

I started experiencing anxiety and depression in the eighth grade. I didn't know the feelings by those names at the time. I just knew that this unnamable fear would come in heartstopping waves of pain, sometimes for weeks on end. And then, just like that, it would lift. I couldn't control when it came, and I couldn't control when it would leave.

In tenth grade, a friend offered me weed. I said no, on the basis that I had an addictive personality and family history of drug abuse.

In my first year of university, a different friend asked and I said yes. I was curious, and all my friends really liked it, and everyone at my liberal arts university smoked. 

And just like that, I found it: the switch that could control my anxiety and depression. When I smoked, my racing thoughts finally stopped. It was easier to laugh, easier to enjoy food, easier to enjoy life. It was so much better than my antidepressants, which kept me from feeling awful but didn't make me happy. Weed gave me the dopamine I craved so badly. Slowly, over the course of three years, I became a daily smoker because as long as I was high, I wasn't hurting.

By my third year of University, I was smoking almost every day. And then my University closed down due to COVID-19. I moved back to my childhood home (where I am right now) and nothing is keeping me from being high all the time. 

I've tried to cut back and it doesn't work. I end up breaking all of my rules. I took a 27-day break earlier on in the year (May) and the withdrawals were absolute hell, sent me into a depressive and anxious episode that made me feel so much shame and anger towards myself for letting the dependency get so far. I couldn't believe that the little kid who was afraid of weed had turned into a stoner. I swore I would never smoke again, but you know how it goes. As soon as I started feeling like my old self, I forgot about the promises I made. I felt totally fine, so it was fine if I had an occasional joint, right?

Well, occasionally became at least two joints a day. I work and do school remotely from my computer. During all of the summer + September, I showed up to work and school high every single day. My partner is long-distance, so she didn't know how bad my addiction has gotten. My parents work during the day, so I'm alone most of the day.

Folks, I really want to break this cycle. I don't want to numb my feelings with weed because it only makes the anxiety + depression So Much Worse when I stop. 

I'm 1 week sober today. The panic attacks and low mood have been constant companions over the last seven days, and knowing that smoking a bowl would only delay the withdrawals a little longer keeps me from getting more. 

But I'm so scared that once I start feeling better, I will fall back into the weed cycle of being high and loving it for a couple of months, being high and hating myself for a couple of months, going through the hell of withdrawal, feeling a bit better, and then getting high again.

My job is really stressful right now. I called out today so I can rest. My stomach is a nauseous churning ball of anxiety. My brain is throwing everything at me. Most of the anxiety is based on real actual things but my anxiety is blowing everything out of proportion.



This is the very first time I’ve ever actually decided to stop for good. In the past whenever I quit, in the back of my head I always thought “yeah I’m stopping but this is just until I finally get to a good place”... lo and behold whenever I start smoking again my life slowly degrades in quality. This time I decided not to go back ever, no matter how good life gets or no matter how confident I am I can “just smoke a little” or “just hit this J a couple times and that’s it”


I feel like everything else is shit and I can’t change it right now. So I’ll stop smoking. Because I can manage that even though it’s hell. I’m anxious about living without smoking but excited to get past all this fucking shit.


I have to quit so I can finally become the man I could be.


I know I can do it. But holy shit... it’s so rough. I keep telling myself not to listen to my anxiety right now because I can’t trust my head right now.

The only true withdrawal symptom I had was coughing up phlegm but I also have asthma, so I'm not sure if that played a role.

In 2015, once I graduated and ended up with a job I hated, I started smoking more and more. It became a daily habit and now in 2020, I'm determined to kick it to the curb.

Overall, here's what I noticed:

\-My concentration and focus is significantly improved. I completed the Beginner's Google Analytics course in one day. That's something I wouldn't have been able to do high.

\-My eating habits are getting better. No more late night cravings or munchies.

\-My emotions. Outside of that time of the month, I'm able to recognize any negative thoughts and stop them more quickly. I can recognize when my anxiety starts and what's causing it instead of immediately wanting to smoke and cover it up like a bandaid. I will say that around my designated smoking times, I would get this anxious feeling in my stomach and I knew that was my body's way of wanting to smoke. I had to push past that , tell myself it was the weed talking and keep myself busy. So far, so good.

It's what I would do when I was sad, when I was happy, when I was anxious or calm... nearly any situation I could reason out a way that weed would improve it. But I don't even get high anymore, and yet it continues.

I'm doing worse at work and at school, it's ruining my relationships with most of my colleagues and teachers/supervisors. I look like a lazy, flaky piece of shit. Maybe I am. I know I need therapy but I'm going to be kicked off my parents' insurance in the next year, and who knows when I'd even be able to visit in-person (therapy just isn't the same over video).

I wake up one morning, feeling normal and go to the bathroom to drop the kids at the pool. As I sit down, I start to feel sick and sweating bullets. Within 5 minutes I have a sharp pain in my stomach, going up to my throat and then I start vomitting. I must have retched and vomitted at least 10 times in the first hour. I was so dehydrated and shaking so badly I had to be taken to the hospital. 

The doctors did all sorts of tests - ultrasound, endoscopy, biopsies, poked and prodded for 2 days. I was given a cocktail of basic antibiotics intravenously, as well as anti nausea and massive painkillers (morphine) for the pain. The pain, nausea, and vomitting all slowly stopped so I was allowed back home and told to change to a low fat diet. 

2 months later, August 2020. Exact. Same. Situation. 
This time I was in hospital for 3 days, sent home every evening and having to come back because I couldn't keep anything down. When I was home, the only thing that helped relieve the symptoms was having long hot showers every 40 minutes (which I've done for nausea since I was a kid!).
Another round of tests, antibiotics, and painkillers. Results came back completely normal other than my gall bladder, but I had no stones! I was then told I have something called Gilbert's syndrome which can come up like gall stones in your bloods.Was sent home and told to stick to the low fat diet and no fasting (I was doing IF 16/8 to lose weight). Cannabis was never mentioned. 

Both of these times I waited at least a week after my recovery was underway to start smoking again.

Third time unlucky? I've just started my recovery from having another attack. Hospitalised for 2 days, potassium levels were so low my muscles were cramping and I had to be given diazapam as well as pain killers and a potassium drip over 4 hours. Every time I was admitted over the last 4 months I told the doctors about my habitual smoking (daily) as I knew lying about anything would only make diagnosis harder. Only the sixth time I was admitted did they say that's what they think it is. CHS.

I'd never heard about this before, and even though it's not life threatening, it means giving up weed for good. 

It's now been 3 days since my recovery started, and the cravings are coming back hard and strong. But I haven't given in. I've been wanting to stop for a while, but have never had the willpower to do so. My body has made the decision for me, and I'm going to stick to it.

I wanted to write this post for anyone who's possibly going through the same thing I did, but is in the stage I was in 2-4 months ago. The not knowing was the hardest part, I felt helpless and like everything I was doing was for naught. 

It's not a 100% confirmed diagnosis, but it seems to fit the best, so I'm going to give this my best shot!

I hope I can come back to you all when I'm struggling, because I know we're all in this together ❤️

I'm already in recovery from alcoholism, so I don't think I can BS my way around this anymore.

Around ~6 months sober I started taking some THC oil. It was mostly recreational, but I did notice that it took the edge off sobriety. I had a hard rule to not use it during the day, and usually I wouldn't even use it during the week. (sound familiar?)

This pandemic has been a motherfucker. I've lost multiple friends to relapse, and I came about as close as I have in 23 months sober on Sunday to relapsing myself after a celebration of life for a friend/coworker.

It was during the pandemic that I started to go beyond the 10mg max, weekend-only stuff. I'm a PhD student, so I control my own workflow. All that to say that I have close to zero accountability as long as I meet deadlines. I've been working from home or doing remote field work now for most of this year. At first, I'd never use it when actually working on anything that requires thought. I'd limit it to taking ~5mg and mapping data, which was a sweet spot that I loved hitting. 

Fast forward to Sunday. It took 35mg with a fatty supper to feel anything. My anxiety is out of control, and I'm no longer engaging with my life. I decided to stop, at least for a bit. 

I'm on day 4 now and I think that stopping for 'just a bit' is no longer in the question. I purposely didn't google what THC withdrawal symptoms are, because I  didn't want to key into things just because I'm open to suggestion. I never used when I was drinking because I was still living in the States where it was mostly illegal at the time. I'm a working professional, so I'd fool myself into thinking that legal whiskey was the way to go instead of interacting with shady dealers (I'm naive, I know). 

I have been FANTASTIC during the day. I'm engaging with life again, connecting with colleagues over Zoom, and I'm overall happier. 

However, the nights have been shit. I live in a cabin in northern Canada right now, and it was 1°C when I woke up. Despite that, I woke up COVERED in sweat, and I have been all week. 

THC habits are real. Withdrawals are real. I didn't think they were, and I've been deceiving myself that I wasn't using it problematically.

I had been free from weed for about 8 months and my confidence was through the roof. I nailed it, but I had to do a few of these presentations as we couldn't fit everyone into the meeting room.   

So muggins here decided to have a smoke after the first successful presentation. Why not ey? I know what I'm doing right?  

Now I had started to get really bad anxiety off weed before I quit. I was a long term smoker and I was suffering with pretty bad social anxiety.   

Now after that one evening of smoking, the next day (2nd presentation) I was a complete mess. In between my words I felt like the whole room was judging me. I was stuttering, going red and just didn't make the impression I did in the first session. 

It was very odd how much it affected my confidence after that one session. In fact it affects me for a few days afterwards now. Call it placebo, call it learned behaviour but I 100% feel that weed makes me too self aware to handle anything sociable these days.

After yesterdays AWESOME live chat session, I wanted to share my story.

&#x200B;

First off, backstory.

Before a couple of weeks ago, I would smoke every evening (bowl after bowl) to relax and decompress. I would use it as a way to enjoy movies etc.

When COVID started, I really felt isolated. My girlfriend and I were not longer together and my closest friend took a trip to Atlanta. I really felt alone. What did I do? Smoked! I could smoke and watch YouTube and create adventures of my own, and never be the wiser as to how it was impacting my mental state.

Fast forward to two weeks ago when I had a sleepless night. This is uncommon for me, but it does happen from time to time. The next few days, I got little sleep as well. Now this is different.. why all of the sudden am I having a hard time sleeping? My mind was racing, I couldn't relax and just drift off..

Keep in mind, I was still smoking at this time, but I had decided to ""taper"" off how much I was, just to see if it would help. Well it did not.

This is when the panic started to kick in. 4 or 5 days of little to no sleep really scared me. I called a doctor and told him about the insomnia, my weed habits and how I just need something to help me sleep. He told me that even slowing down on weed can cause insomnia and anxiety. He told me that long term use can actually bring on anxiety that you might not have had noticed before. We agreed I would stop using and that I would seek therapy for the onset of anxiety.

So now I am on day 3. I have spoken with a therapist once and have a follow up on Thursday.

As of now, I do not have cravings for the weed. The big issues I am facing right now are sleep and food. It's so hard to stomach food and sleep has been super spotty. However, last night, for the first time in a LONG time I had really vivid dreams and feel like I actually got DEEP sleep, even if it wasn't a super long session. 

Few questions for the community:

\- Did anyone hit a wall while using? I mean, did anxiety trigger a need to stop smoking for you? I ask because im worried that my anxiety might not be from the weed but was an underlying issues that was being covered up by it. I dont remember really ever being anxious before I smoked, so I am hoping this is temporary. All of the withdrawal symptoms ive read here say that anxiety started AFTER quitting. I am actually quitting because of the sudden onset of anxiety.

\- What did you do for sleep? How long did your sleep issues last? (severe issues I mean.) I can handle 5 or 6 hours but I cannot handle not sleeping at all. The doc has prescribed me a sedative to assist with my anxiety while I get through this, but I dont want to take it longer than I have to.

I've smoked for about 1.5 years to get over and happy with being alone. I smoked to ""escape"", which is what I think many of us do. I'm 23 girl with have an amazing career with 2 jobs and saving good money. Life gets lonely being single and I just like smoking to be with myself. I've been reading and part of this group for a while now. I tried to view this ""addiction"" from a psychological perspective. Most of our thoughts about weed are really emotional. ""I can't live without it"", ""everything is boring"", ""this would be so much better if I was high right now"" and my favourite one, ""this is the last joint then once I've smoked it I'm quitting"". I can relate and I feel like it has taken over me like black magic. Most of this is due to thoughts our minds are producing in this very moment. But our thoughts are 90% are memories of either happy or sad pain (which is always a form of fear), if it's pain it causes us to worry and get anxious, if it's happy then it's probably worried about the future, ""I'll be happier when I have more weed"". Always past or future, never present, which probably explains why most of us smoke. I had a shitty childhood and my dad was a heavy smoker, so I know why some addictive tendencies passed down through genetics. I know it's my responsibility and that's only one piece of the problem. We all need to figure out what we are feeding our minds to make us feel this way towards weed. It's the addiction to the feeling. Theory says, the substance isn't the issue, It's the relationship we have with it. I feel like if weed was a person I would've married him and had 100 kids. Lol.  It's an illusion, our thoughts are not working in clock time, rather running on psychological time, which is way worse because we're dwelling, deceiving and fooling ourselves. YOU ARE NOT YOUR ADDICTION. I can't speak for everyone, but I think some of us and most of us are in pain.  Here are some notes from one of the greatest books I've read and it's really helping me. It's called the power of now; 
- The greater part of human pain is unnecessary, it is self created, as long as the unobserved mind runs your life.
- The pain you create now is always some form of non-acceptance, unconscious resistance to what it is 
- On the level of thought the resistance is some form of judgement, on the emotional level it's some form of negativity 
- The industry of the pain is the degree of resistance to the present moment 
And this in turn depends on how strongly you are identified with your mind 
- The mind always denies the NOW and tries to escape from the PRESENT moment 
- The more you're identified with your mind, the more you suffer 
- The more you're able to honour and respect the now, the more you're free of pain and suffering and free of the egoic mind 
- Why does the mind resist the now? Because it cannot function and remain in control without time, which is past and future 
So it perceives the timeless now as threatening

Anyway, I recommend that book. It's helped me so much. Whether it be from trauma growing up or recent bad memories. I read a lot of theory and if you look up Maslow's hierarchy of needs, we all have five levels to be fulfilled. Psychological needs (water, food), safety needs, belonging and love needs, esteem needs (feeling of accomplishment) and self-actualisation which is the best mental state to be at. If you didn't feel safe growing up, you most likely suffer from anxiety. I have a Masters degree in teaching and I've seen kids who grow up in this way and it breaks my heart. I try to do good for these kids what teachers never did for me. It kills me to have this addiction eve cause When you smoke it takes you out of the present moment. I can't describe it, it's like trying to explain swimming to someone who's never been inside water. Imagine this, a fish is born and we call it jack and give it a birth certificate with a date of birth, then 2 minutes later he gets eaten. He isn't going to remember that his name or anything, but you made it into a mental idol so you dwelled on it. Point is, we need to move away from the mental labelling and conditioning. You are not conditioned to think about weed in that way, go deeper. Find out what causes these thoughts come your biology, triggers and individual environment. All these play a role. 
I know quitting is hard, especially because hard if  you've been high you know it takes you out of the present and into a ""happier place"". But Are we being present? Are we actually living or escaping? It's no wonder 80% of us lose the high feeling. Because we've spent so much of our time getting high, it became our normal. But when and why did we stop living. That place we got to when we're high is not present and that means we're stuck in our minds. When we try to quit it won't work. You can't solve your problems on the same level of thinking you created it try

If we all keep thinking in these unhealthy ways then we leave no room for growth and change. We can't control our thoughts or feelings, otherwise I think we wouldn't be in this situation. 
but we can identify them and make b
My point is, just because you ""feel"" a certain way doesn't mean it's true. Your feelings are a mental projection reflected from your thought patterns. If you cannot control your thoughts or ignore them, you will constantly be a slave to your misleading thinking.  

I was watching a show yesterday called strange addictions and this 53 year old lady was obsessed with mice in cages all over her house. Reality is our thoughts drive our emotions. If we don't realise that WEED has no future or past, it just is what it is, we will continue torturing ourselves with this mind made idol. You can be addicted to anything you tell your mind, so get addicted to being present.

Other things might seem more urgent, but getting high is the biggest overall block towards progressing in life, and I'm tired of not making any progress.

I won’t make this long but I’m 29 years old and been smoking weed for about 2 years casually and everything was good. However, the last 7 months have been smoking all day every day. I was constantly high because I was trapped home from lockdown and working from home so I ended up smoking a lot.

Anyway, I been trying to quit and every time I do I wake up with crippling anxiety. I never experienced this anxiety before, even before smoking weed or smoking it casually. 

The anxiety is so bad that I relapsed into smoking again just to not feel that terrible feeling. Usually it’s worse in the mornings and then resolves itself in a few hours, usually by late afternoon. I been able to tolerate this for a few days before going back to smoking and trying all over again.

Is the anxiety normal? There’s no specific “thoughts” that are causing the anxiety, I can’t tell you what it is, but I just wake up feeling like super nervous as if I’m about to give a speech in front of a million people  type nervous with no racing or crazy thoughts. Just that feeling in the pit of your stomach.

Please help me with suggestions, is this due to quitting weed? Or perhaps the weed hid my true anxiety due to this crazy ass year?

I know many have followed my PAWS threads. You can search my history to see the long PAWS history. And I only used weed for 3 months, but I had a large dose on my birthday. Suffice it to say it has been a brutal year.  I said in my last post I would stay away from posting for awhile but I thought I would come back to share some good news and an important update.

Things have been improving over the last month. Most notably, my eye floaters and clarity of vision seems to have improved. Tinnitus is gone. And the pressure in my head is becoming much more mild. I also yesterday had what seemed to be the best mood I've had in a year. I honestly felt like the old me for a little while. No anxiety and just enjoyed listening to music. 

So perhaps the most notable news is my dentist diagnosed me with bruxism (Night time teeth grinding) and perhaps a TMJ problem. My symptoms of late have been similar to TMJ problems, so I asked the dentist and she thought that I do indeed have that problem. I'm not surprised. All the anxiety over the months probably led to this occuring. They made me a night guard and I have been using it for a week. I do seem to feel improved but I'll give it another full month or two before reaching a verdict. The head pressure might be from Bruxism, so I hope the nightguard will help rid me of it. 

However things are coming along. It's hard to believe I'm feeling as good as I am now after enduring months of headaches, electrical tingles, burning pains, and many other godawful symptoms. I feel mostly normal now. I'd say maybe I'm an 8.5 out of 10 now. Getting close to saying 9 out of 10 but not quite there yet.

I've been a heavy smoker for 22 years now. There wasn't a day or an activity that I thought that weed wouldn't make better. Wake and bake every day. Take my dugout to work. Take a hit (or 5) when I got home. A few more before going to bed at night. Weekends were always just a blur. I have only successfully quit 2 times in that 22 years, and never for more than a month. 

I'm one of those dreaded ""successful"" potheads. Never got in trouble. Have a decent job that I've basically been on autopilot for 19 years now with (even though I know I could do better...quitting long enough to pass a drug test sounded awful so I never tried.) I feel like I've been dormant for most of my adult life, and I feel like time is quickly slipping away from me both professionally and personally.

I will be the first to admit that smoking this much has lead to diminishing returns. Even worse, it has made me very paranoid. About my romantic relationships. About my friends and family and what they think of me. About shit that I can't control (politics these days, am I right?) I would smoke and just sit there and think of the worst fucking case scenarios possible. ALL OF THIS WAS IN MY HEAD. But God, it felt so real. My anxieties were at an all-time high and so was my depression. I could not escape my own mind fuck. My imagination, especially when high (which I was all the time) was out of control and so was I. Everyone in my head was after me. Was about to leave me for someone better. Was giving up on me or just didn't care about me any more. All of this was 100% bullshit. After a lot of soul searching I figured out...

The one common denominator was weed.

Labor day weekend was the final straw. I had a 3 day pity party for myself over NOTHING IMPORTANT and smoked myself stupid, until it was all gone. I was ready for change. I was begging for change. 22 years is a LONG fucking time to be lost in the fog. I knew that the REAL me was not this man. He was just hibernating somewhere inside my head this whole time. I have an addictive personality and have always had problems with self-discipline and self-control. This was about to be the biggest positive change in my adult life, and by damned I wanted it to work and I was ready to really commit to making myself better.

This community has helped SO much. Reading your stories and hearing your tips has been my support group. On the advice of a few posters on here, I downloaded the ""Quit Weed"" app for my phone and have kept track of my progress. That app has been a godsend, because it made me feel accountable and it has given me plenty of advice on just what to expect physically, mentally, and emotionally during each stage of my detox. Knowing that what you are going through is common and what to expect next in my journey really helped. Reading the success stories and struggles and encouragement from this incredible community has really helped too :) I told my friends and the family members that knew of my hobby that I was quitting. I told my dealer too. All have been very supportive and I feel that by telling them it holds me more accountable. I don't want to let them down and relapse.

Today is day 28. Four weeks in, I feel like a new man. I feel like my brain has rewired itself. I'm not out of the woods yet, I have no delusions that those cravings will go away completely. But I have a mental and emotional clarity that I haven't had in a very long time. When one of those cravings hits, I ask myself ""ok what triggered this?... am I hungry? Tired? Thirsty? Stressed? What do I need right now, besides weed, that can ease this craving back down to nothing?"" Exercising helps tremendously. The mindfucks and paranoia are just about completely gone....and when those voices whisper in my ear I tune them out, or logically rip them apart (something I could never do before).

I don't want to go back. I don't want to smoke again. It's great for some people but even one hit will send me spiraling and calling my dealer. I want to take this 28 days and double it. Triple it. I feel like a bear waking from a very long hibernation. I want to make new hobbies, be SOCIAL again (smoking made me a hermit) and not feel like I have to have this crutch in order to get anything done in my life.

For those of you thinking about starting this journey, DO IT. Fight through those first two weeks of hell. Do it for YOU. It's never too late to change. Keep evolving, keep fighting. For those of you that have shared your stories and written words of encouragement for others who are down....THANK YOU. From a long time lurker, you don't know how much that encouragement actually means. 

The fog has lifted, and I feel almost stoic. May the Force be with you on your own journey. Be it day 1 or 100.

Strengthened my resolve.,"After 4 years of near-daily smoking, I made my First Real Attempt to quit. I made it to day 7 before I got some unexpected news that really wrecked me emotionally and brought up some traumatic memories that I hadn't thought about in years. Couldn't think about anything else all day.  After several hours of crying, I was over it and decided to smoke. I just didn't want to think about it or feel it anymore and I knew that would work.

I didn't feel guilty, I even logged it in Grounded to hold myself accountable with every intention of that being the ONE time I smoked and didn't reset my quit date. 

Aaaand then I smoked in the evening the next 3 nights, too. 

This is still progress, I'm telling myself. In those first 7 days it was impossible not to notice the difference in my body and emotions. If I went a week, I can definitely make it 2 weeks. And previously, I would've smoked several times in a day, not just in the evening. So all was not lost, but I was certainly set back.

I think the experience helped me realize my triggers: being upset, sad, or bored. I'm not sure what it is about the evening that makes me want to smoke, but I crave it so much worse once the sun goes down. It also dawned on me for the first time that weed wasn't my first vice. Before I began smoking, I was dating an alcoholic and drank heavily and often, because that was just what we did.  We were young and free and within walking distance of bars. I had normalized it, just like I normalized smoking so excessively. I never felt dependent on alcohol, and I actually quit almost cold turkey once we broke up, so I knew I wasn't an alcoholic... but I realized that I replaced one vice with another almost immediately. Which means this started when I was \~19, and has continued to now (27). 

I also finally got to realize the difference in my quality of sleep. HOLY. SHIT. I already have a sleep disorder, so my sleep isn't great. But previously I thought the weed \*helped\*. Each night that I smoked I had absolutely terrible sleep. Waking up 15+ times, sleeping past the time my body normally wakes up if I don't smoke, and one morning even got up at 4:30 AM after falling asleep after 12 AM. I hadn't ever made that strong a connection before.

Yesterday morning I reset my quit date in Grounded. Last night I had extreme urges to smoke, and instead of giving in, I logged onto reddit and started reading posts in Leaves. I didn't smoke. I slept and had crazy vivid dreams. Nothing has helped more than reading other people's stories about why they're quitting/how hard it's been/how rewarding it's been. I realized that when I want to smoke, thinking about making it through that day - just that day! just get to sleep! - was highly beneficial, as well as continuing to fill my brain with other positive things - like this sub.

TL;DR: Adult-led weaning of MJ, that's it!

I am an addict of about 10+ years daily (1.0 to 1.5g) use. I started using as a teenager and it quickly became something I really enjoyed: I convinced myself the substance made me more confident, and hence more intelligent overall as some psychological/social barriers fell.  I never was the couch-locked smoker,  I used it for making music, studying, working, going out: a super productive stoner! It became something I did in order for something tolerable to become **enhanced**. When high, boredom would cease to exist, I was looking forward to the whole spectrum of activities with an excitement and a crazy-level of motivation.

About 3 years ago, I started to work seriously on many aspects of my personal life so as to become a 'better' person. I had a list of things I wanted to improve: Binge eating, never again! Slouching due to cell phone use, never again! Cigarettes, no more! etc. But using MJ - that one had to wait...but still I switched to daily vaping rather than smoking so that was good on the wallet (1 monthly ounce to about 3-4 ounces per year) and less worse on the lungs. But with that I  became this 'undercover' stoner...creating excuses to actually vape. Around that same time I also started using sublingual THC tinctures.

Now over the summer, I wanted to improve again: can I let go of using? Not yet...but in order to improve I could let go of vaping and rely solely on tinctures. But, having this motivation to change I decided to go all in: let go of my stoner-self and I've decided to **not use at all**.

Right now, I need to **deconstruct** the very idea of it allowing me to create stuff and be excited about things. This is the greatest challenge!  It's been a little over a month of sobriety...I've never been *that sober* as an adult, I must keep on to reach the state of being high on 'sobriety' if that makes any sense...

I’ve grown up throughout middle school and high school smoking pot. The first time I got caught, my dad says”it’s ok to smoke sometimes” and so that was surly noted. Throughout highschool I smoked all day, hanging with the burnouts and losers, just thinking that all of this will fade away and pot will be just some kind of fun hobby when I was young. Sadly that never happened.

I started dating this girl after high school and felt so amazing because she also enjoyed pot. We even traveled to rec states just to see their product and get high(I live in NC). Sadly throughout College, we couldn’t make things work out and we went our separate ways.

I sadly fell into a downward spiral as friends were showing me how much money they are making and I’m just sitting here in college, so I almost overdosed and died. From that moment, I swore to be sober. AA meetings, sobriety clubs, and psychologists helped me stay on track for 4 months and I was doing and feeling better than ever. 

After I graduated, I moved back to Charlotte with my parents and received a not so great job. The stress and no support got me back into the ring of alcohol and weed. One of my best friends reached out to me for a Roomate and was deeply interested!

I thought that my two friends grew up from drugs and drinking, but it was actually worse. I partied with them about every weekend where excessive drinking and cocaine was the answer to them. 

I actually hated cocaine because it reminds me of crack and never got into that. So I stayed away and made excuses on certain weeks why I couldn’t hangout with them until last weekend.

I made up that I was going to a wedding that weekend, but it’s actually this weekend. I just couldn’t handle the partying because I’m starting this new job and it’s a lot I need to clarify/understand. 

Last night, they were asking me all of these questions about it, and I think they know I was lying. 

I also work remote at my parents house and what’s extremely hard is that my parents got back from Colorado and bought some high grade back with them.

-How can I stay sober from all of this for the sake of my well-being and my job?
-how can I tell my close minded friends that I cannot smoke when before I’d always be down?
-should I tell my friends that I lied to them?

I stopped smoking weed 3 months ago and life has gone into high gear it seems. I think this is partly because I stopped smoking weed and the stuff that is happening in my life is good, but it is a lot:

\- I found a new job, I will start next month. 

\- I'm moving to a new city next month, my girlfriend and I are going to live together (first time for both of us to live together)

\- Friend needs support because of relationship problems

&#x200B;

This gives me some stress:

\- I need to pass some courses for my new job this month. If I don't pass them it will look really bad at the new job. I think I can do it, but it worries me.

\- I resigned last month at my current job and want to finish my projects before I leave.

\- I have to arrange the moving, I have to sell stuff, pack everything, buy stuff together with my girlfriend, contact the municipality, lots of paperwork, etc. etc.

&#x200B;

To summarize, it's a lot of things I need to do and have been doing the past couple months. Also a lot to think about. Because of all this the urge to start smoking again is noticably increasing. I haven't done it and am not planning on smoking, but I feel like the extra stress is making it harder to keep the course. 

The weird thing is that by not smoking weed I have been able to start all these things that give me stress right now. It's very noticable for me in the little tasks, when I was regurarly smoking I would always procrastinate, but now I just do them. However, it all seems to pile up right now. Weed was kind of my own little space where I didn't need to worry about stuff. Now that escape is gone and it's a bit difficult.

You know how when people have been traumatised over something that when you try to talk to them it’s like you can’t cos all their attention is focused on something. They will be staring at a wall and you try tap their shoulder but they don’t respond. Just full-on spaced out. That’s me but I can fight the spacing out bit and still function and do something unless I decide to actually space out(which feels better for me).

Last Saturday was in my day 21 after quitting.

They started to smoke and i don't know why, but i thought that maybe i would feel better if i smoked those joints. And i did. 

I was so wrong about feeling better. I felt really paranoid and disorientated, and i lost my short term memory. Being high was not better at all! It made my feel awful, awfully paranoid. Also, i had a headache on Sunday. 

So i'm back in day 4 but that was such a lesson. I still want to smoke, and i don't know why. Because i don't enjoy being high anymore. Such a pity, but it's the reality.

There were points where I smoked over a gram a day and spent almost all the little money I had as a student on weed. Every plan I made by myself or with friends always had weed involved, and importance was always given to weed in order to make sure that we can smoke joints, blunts, or rips wherever we went. I noticed my anxiety (especially social anxiety) as well as depression increase - I was never like this before, and think I am quite an out-going person by nature. This (along with many other reasons), is why I decided to stop smoking weed for good.

After my 4th day of not smoking weed, I felt great physically and mentally, managed to eat more throughout the day (awesome for my training and well-being), and was also improving in the way I communicate with others. However, after my 11th day sober, I started to experience nightmares revolving around my insecurities and fears almost every night, I get moments where I feel really depressed and anxious throughout the day, randomly out of nothing. Not to make this a long post, I was wondering if it's normal to get nightmares, feelings of depression, and anxiety after quitting weed. I know it says so online and there are quite a few posts on here that mention these as normal side-effects.

I was wondering, how long am I to expect these feelings to happen, I'm willing to tough it out, but would be amazing to know if there's an end to it and if it's normal or not. I'm going to the gym almost every day (that feels great), doing yoga every morning, meditating daily, not drinking coffee, drinking a lot of water, and taking a variety of different vitamins (so I should be zen as fuck lol). 

Any insight on this would be highly appreciated and would help me push towards a happier and healthier version of myself.

 I've got weird headaches all day (nothing like a ""normal"" headache I've experinced before, my brain feels heavy and my whole head hurts) , I'm tired and feel like sleeping all the time, and I got these weird fevers every evening (It's not just regular weed sweats)

I also feel extremely tired and foggy when I wake up in the morning,  even with 8 hours of sleep,  but this may be due to waking up during REM sleep.

Besides from that, I fall asleep in 5-10 mins! I was afraid of not getting much sleep when I decided to quit, but that is luckilly not a problem :D

I felt amazing the first few days after quitting, I finally felt like the old me again, lots of energy, focused, talkative, and I didn't live inside my head.

Ever since I quit 9 months ago, I often have dreams of badass smoke sessions in exotic places with all sorts of people.

I think of it as a positive to quitting, it keeps things interesting without being addicted to it. I wonder how long it will take to wear off? I have no intention of smoking again. Sometimes I wake up feeling high from a dream and quickly snap back to reality.

But it’s my last 6 months going all out and finding out how hard you can crash. I’ve trolled this sub since 4/20 knowing my time was coming. 

I’m 30M. Two kids under 3 and a beautiful wife. Started my own business in March 19’, did alright for a year and watched covid shit all over that and my wife’s income. We needed to come up with a plan.

Thankfully we bought a house before the kids came. Bad news is we couldn’t afford the house and our massive amount of debt that just kept growing ($65k between the two of us, no student loans). 

The plan was simple enough, take advantage of all covid relief problems, don’t pay any bills and pour the money into the house in the hopes of selling for enough to get out of debt. Any of you aware with the remodeling process will know that a complete house flip while working a full time remodeling gig is just plain tough. Long nights. Every night. Long weekends. Every weekend.

Thankfully I had good ol’ Mary Jane and Tito (vodka) to keep my spirits up. I smoked and drank regularly before, but nothing like the last 5 months. Wake and bake daily.. waiting for the clock to hit 11:01am because I eat lunch 11 and drinks are ok with lunch - and if you’re going to start, why stop? I was able to gut an entire tiles surrounded tub, install new tub and plumbing, wallboard, waterproof, tile and grout the entire thing in 36 hours. I couldn’t be fucking stopped.

The house is under agreement for a great price, we’ve moved north to my parents house as it’s our only option for now and things were getting great. Until Tuesday night into Wednesday morning when they stopped being great. Wife and I ripped our new dab pen a bunch before bed. Stoned and happy to be starting to move on. I knew that moving wouldn’t *really* change my habits too much, but it would help cut back and that’s all I needed. Fuck, was I wrong.

Wednesday 4am I had the worst stomach pain I’ve had in a while. Followed by relentless vomiting. Couldn’t keep even water down by Friday morning so off to the ER. I’m feeling a fist sized hole in the middle of my stomach and the constant urge to puke. Even when you do pule, zero relief. Got my fluids, got my meds, just food poisoning right? Saturday feeling good. Been keeping things down. Take a shower, have some toast and hit my pen to bang up that appetite. I felt great, for all of ten minutes. The pain in my stomach came **roaring** back and I was right at the place I started at Wednesday morning. I knew it was the pen, and that was the end of it. This morning I woke up feeling like a whole new man. I was at my work computer getting crews set up for the day and thought I had put this one behind me. Took a bite of food, and everything went downhill immediately. Back to the ER.

The pain was/is still pretty intense, but doctors came to the conclusion that the weed (pen) is to blame. Too much, too long, too hard, etc. I’ve now got 2-4 days of a liquid diet to follow now as to re-train my stomach to eat food again. It’s going to be fucking miserable, but I couldn’t be happier. Thankfully it wasn’t life-threatening, but it was a wake up call nonetheless.

The truth of the matter is I probably could have finished my house just as fast had I been sober. I wouldn’t have stayed up as late, but I wouldn’t have made so many mistakes and I *DEFINITELY* wouldn’t have sat in rooms for 5 minutes wondering why the fuck I went in them.

There’s not much to this story other than saying that this shit is dangerous, and people just don’t realize the power it can have on you. Without this event it would’ve been really hard to quit, but I’d really like to have the last 5 days of my life back. My wife and kids have had to look at daddy like a useless sack and it hurts me seeing how down they are, just wanting me back to normal. Back to dad.

I’m going to explore hobbies and the like, and I know the temptation will always be there, but I’m done with this shit for good, because it is absolutely no good.

This shit doesn’t give you super powers. It’s just taking a small part of your day each time and storing it, waiting to crash on you when your body just can’t handle it anymore.

I hope someone can take even one thing from this and have it help them. I’m incredibly lucky is this game and I know it. Not everyone can say they have a loving family ready to show support. Shit my parents are conservative Christians, telling them (while living at their house) that you’re in the middle of a detox was tough, but they surprised me and were excited to hear about the positives coming out of it.

If I see someone smoking, I want some too.

If I’m going to enjoy a film, I want to smoke beforehand.
I want to smoke after a meal

Now that I don't smoke I absolutely love a nice meal. Even if it's sub par I can still scarf it down. It's just a really good feeling knowing I can go out to eat with friends and not take little baby bird bites and struggle to finish some child's portion because I happened to be sober.

I almost always smoke alone, almost always at night, and I almost always watch TV or listen to a podcast and just ""shut off my brain."" It's become the main or only way I deal with stress and I have a hard time dealing with difficult emotions or going to sleep without it. It hasn't become a huge problem: I have a good job, I don't feel like it's impacting my career, and in some ways it can be a useful motivator for getting through the day. 

However, I've felt like smoking has been a problem for a long time. Smoking makes my life really boring - all I want to do at the end of the day is smoke and I don't really enjoy doing anything else. I don't have any hobbies, and there have been a million times where I'm hanging out with friends and everyone is having fun, and I leave to go home and smoke. When I have an afternoon free on a weekday or I take a vacation, all I want to do is smoke. Also, I don't feel in control of smoking - even when I know it's inappropriate to smoke, like if I'm visiting family or something, I'll find a way to sneak out and smoke at night. For the last 8 years my life has become completely wrapped around working and smoking - I work long hours and then when I come home I eat, smoke a spliff, and watch TV. But I feel like that has shifted my life and priorities in a way that is really destructive. It's also been a problem with my girlfriend, with whom things have gotten more serious. Unsurprisingly, she doesn't love spending every evening with someone who just wants to dissociate from reality. 

I've tried to stop smoking - both cold turkey and cutting down - so many times. And every time I come back to smoking every night. I don't necessarily want to quit completely, because I really enjoy smoking still and I don't want to cut that enjoyment out of my life. I just want a better, more balanced relationship with it. I fantasize about being in a place where if I have an evening free I might actually not want to smoke. Right now that feels impossible. 

Anyway, this site has been really helpful and encouraging. I'm going to try to not smoke every other day, and I'm using some tips people having given.

The two most important things - complete honesty, and a willingness to ask for help. Whatever you do, do not lie about your addiction, and don’t keep secrets. Secrets and lies lead to excuses and compromises which inevitably lead to failure. And I was constantly lying and keeping secrets. It feels so much better to live your life feeling like you have nothing to hide. That’s one of the best parts of it. Addiction is painfully lonely, and refusing to let it keep isolating you is key to overcoming it.

I'm 17 years old and first smoked pot sophomore year of high school. I've ran cross country and track since my 8th grade year and have always had a love for running. 

Ever since I first smoked, I always had some type of obsession over weed. It wasn't until this year (2020) when I realized that this might not be the best thing to obsess over. When the quarantine started, I bought a thc pen that I would hit everyday, because we were all trapped inside. Once that ran out, I switched to flower and smoked that till about May. Once May hit, I started using the pens and vapes again and that didn't stop until June. Basically, since June, I have smoked pretty much every week and on some weeks, I've smoked multiple times a day.

I recently learned that one of my older cousins now has severe schizophrenia, so I started doing more research and found that smoking pot at a young age can increase the chances of contracting this horrible disease... My family has broken apart because of his disease, and it's not something I would wish on my worst enemy. 

As my research continued, I found out about this subreddit and the clarity you get when you're not smoking pot. I know I'm not as far into this than many other people on this subreddit, but we all share a commonality in that we have all abused and may have been addicted to pot.

I've taken long breaks before due to my running seasons and I always remember life just feels better and so much more natural than when you are smoking pot and being in a state of artificial happiness. I've started having vivid dreams (pot suppresses REM sleep btw), I feel like I can run so much farther and faster, and best of all, I sort of feel like myself again. 

I don't really know how long I want to quit for, so I'm taking this day by day and week by week. Every time I buy pot I try to tell myself to ""use it in moderation"", but I always end up having no control with it at all.  Anyways thanks for listening to my story and I really appreciate everybody on here and the strength they exemplify in their day to day battles with quitting this substance.

I was a daily smoker for many many years. On August 30, we ran out for the last time. I knew in my heart that I couldn't keep living like that. 


In the last 35 days:

1. Emotional breakdown resulting in overnight hospitalization. (don't drink if you are on meds, kids!) 

2. Suicidal ideation following breakdown

3. Worst depression episode I've ever had.

4. Major life shift: Daughter moved out (a positive step for her, just sad for mom)

5. Young cat is quite possibly terminally ill.

6. Financial issues caused by pandemic unemployment additional funds ending.

I did this all without weed. In this time, I've also become sober from alcohol, and will need to remain so for the rest of my life. 

I've cried. I've yelled. I shout-sang hours of music. 

I've also been filled with enormous pride and hope.

Guys, it was all tossed at me and I didn't cave.

If you want it out of your life, you CAN do it. I know it's possible. Keep on. Last five more minutes of craving before you relapse. Wait on more hour. 

You can only resolve 'today I'm sober from weed.'

I'm telling you from the other side: it's worth it.

All week I kept complaining that this was the worst time to quit, and maybe I should wait until things calmed down. I talked it out with a friend, and he gave me the best advice:

""There's never a good time to quit weed. If you can make it through this rough time, then the easy times will be a breeze.""

Experienced severe anxiety and a panic attack on the 3rd week of quitting. Was able to see a psych. He was convinced it was withdrawal. Symptoms beginning to ease after the end of 3rd week. Update; Shortness of breath is back 3 weeks after initial withdrawals ended. 

Details:
After reading several posts here on leaves, I am still pretty concered about my mental health and what I have been going through during the last couple of days. 

A little bit of background: I am a 22 year old male. I have never had mental health issues in the past. I started using marijuana recreationally about 2 years ago, but nothing too extreme. I would probably smoke like 3-4 joints per week. I took a month break in between because I left to meet my family and could not use there. During this break, I experienced no withdrawls except for minor cravings. 

After a month break, I started using again since January 2020. This time, I used heavily, and in the past 5-6 months, I was smoking/flower vaping everyday even maybe like 3 times a day. About 3 weeks ago after a bad high, I quit cold turkey. 

During the first week, I experienced body aches, difficulty breathing (difficulty taking deep satisfying breaths) and very minor anxiety during the night time. I had no trouble falling asleep and had no loss of apetite (two symptoms I discovered were very common symptoms of withdrawl experienced by most users and I never experienced these). These symptoms slowly went away in the second week. 

During the third week (that is the past week) I started getting super anxious somewhere between 7PM and 9PM everyday. During the past 4 days, my heart rate randomly goes up as high as 160BPM and stays between 130 BPM and 150 BPM for a good 20-30 minutes (I am able to monitor my pulse trends on my Apple watch). When this happens, I am emotionally stable except that my heart rate is fast and my breathing is fast. This always happens in the time window of 7PM-9PM. The entire day I feel completely normal until somewhere between this time window, I notice my breathing is shallower, faster and heart is racing. 

I was concered about my heart health and I thought getting it checked would be a good idea. Went to the ER twice. They did Xrays, Ultrasound, EKG/ECG, blood tests and everything came out perfectly normal, the doctor said there was nothing wrong with me physically. No signs of arrhythmia or anything concerning. 

Day before yesterday, I smoked in the evening to see if it helps with these dreadful symptoms in the night but no, I still got racing heart rate at 8.15PM. Yesterday I was at the hospital luckily between 7PM and 9PM (my second visit to the ER) and was hoping it would happen again so the doctor could have a real time look at it, but to my surprise it never happened. 

Today I was coming home from groceries at 8.30 PM when I noticed my heart rate faster and breathing shallower, pretty usual stuff since the past 4 days (except for ofcourse yesterday when I was at the ER). I sat down on the stairs outside my house and waited for it to pass as it usually does in like 20-30 minutes, except this time I started hyperventilating, my hands got cramped and numb, I couldn’t think clearly, and my face got numb. Once this happened, I panicked and called 911. I felt like my heart was stopping and I was going to die. Paramedics told me this was a pretty common symptom of a panic attack. 

This was the first panic attack of my life and it was absolutely terrible. I feel completely hopeless and concered. I feel like using marijuana again won’t help me as I did try once but still got the anxiety/racing heart rate. I am worried that this will happen again tomorrow night and I feel like it could be worse. 

I am not sure if anyone out there went through this. I would appreciate if someone out there who has went through this can give me some guidance into dealing with this, as I am simply not in a good state of mind right now. I used to be a mentally stong individual, and would not take stress or worry no matter what. After these episodes, I worry on little things and I don’t know if things will get better. 

Overall I am a strong individual and have a high spirit to live and grow. Any help would be highly appreciated. Thank you so much :-)

UPDATE: I was able to see a psychiatrist. He was pretty convinced that it is just my body reacting to the withdrawl and no treatment is necessary at the moment, as long as this passes in a week or two. He prescribed me Ativan to ease with the anxiety attacks. I will only use it as a last resort due to its side effects and dependence liability. So far, breathing exercises are doing wonders. I practiced those the entire day yesterday. I did feel a little anxious during the two hour window but I am happy to report that my heart rate was in completely normal range throughout. I put this out here if it helps anyone going through this. Remember, this shall pass and we are strong. :-)

I voluntarily stopped smoking weed because it was giving me more anxiety than not when I was high. I found myself not actually doing the things that I really wanted... the things that make me truly happy. The first time I quit was as a challenge to just see if I could, but I slipped back in really easily. That first time it was out of desperation and financial issues to get my life sorted. But this time... this time I felt ready to not have it in my life. This time I lost the connection to it that I once had so deeply.  I had about an ounce of flower, and I gave it all away as presents. I told everyone important in my life about this new lifestyle change so I would be held accountable. And now a couple of my friends have been smoking less and less because they've felt encouraged to do so by my efforts.

There's been so many challenging moments of boredom or things just seemingly not going my way. These are the times I ""want"" to smoke and get high, but it's not me actually *wanting* to... I realized it's me being so uncomfortable in my anxious states that I don't want to feel, that it's so overwhelming to feel all of this feeling. Every time I have a moment where I say, ""ughh I wish I could just get high,"" I just remember it is not me really even craving the high anymore, it's me wanting to live in ignorance. But I've realized, for me, ignorance is no longer bliss... ignorance is stagnation, and I'm not meant to stay in one mode... I'm meant to ride this ever-changing wave. 

What a fun and cruel rollercoaster of emotions these past few months have been. There's been few days where it's been completely joyous and happy. There's been few days where it's been completely and utterly unbearable and grueling. Most of the time, though, it's a  wobbly balance of self-doubt and confidence. (Whoever said to take it one day at a time was right haha!!) And coming into these three and a half months, I am starting to get the hang of letting go of control, of just enjoying those few moments of bliss, of recognizing my strength in those moments of doubt and disbelief. This teeter totter balancing trick is one that I will never be comfortable with, but slowly, as my ambition and drive come back, and I relearn how to use them, so does the effort to put in consistent work, making it a little less wobbly. Don't get me wrong, there are *those* moments... the heaviest of the heavy, but just remembering why I stopped smoking weed is the reason I keep going.

So 100 fucking days man! I wanted to share it with people who really get this difficult ride, my people. I am truly proud of myself today, and I hope I am just as proud of myself tomorrow. I never would've thought that I could last a week, so I am just excited to share with you all :)

Its been about a week since I gave it up, and I am beginning to remember why I started smoking so heavily in the first place. I don't know if I have anger issues or what.. Its not even that I am angry or that I am getting angry, its that I feel violent. There is some anger too, over very silly and insignificant minor things. But I don't process anger loudly. I get quiet and its like time slows down and I just feel like I am holding back the flood gates, and that were they to release I might end up hurting someone (or myself). I feel dangerous, and I don't like it.

I always liked to smoke because when I felt like this, it helped me to step back and relax and realize that there is no need or place for anger like this, and that everything was going to be just fine if I just let go a little and smiled. Smoking reminded me of the good things in life. It helped me feel better. It really always was medicine for me and I still feel that way to this day. Its not just that I miss getting high, its that I don't like feeling this way and I have such a hard time letting go of this red rage. It feels like constriction in my chest. I don't even have a reason to be angry right now - I feel like I am looking for one. Like I am angry and that all I need is a reason to snap.

So why did I stop smoking? I really want to join the Navy. I want to be a pilot more than I have ever wanted anything in my life. I need to piss clean in January, so I have stopped smoking weed now but I feel SO ANGRY about nothing. It probably doesn't help that I always used to smoke spliffs (gave up cigarettes a long time ago, but I always liked to mix a decent amount of tobacco in my rolls) so I am probably having some nicotine withdrawls in addition to lack of THC.

I don't know what I am looking for on here. Advice? Sure, let me have it. I just need to externalize these feelings inside me because they don't feel good. Maybe these feelings will benefit me when I am in the military. Maybe they will give me the edge I need to be a killer. But for now, when I am surrounded by family, I don't like feeling this way.

I'm not actually going to hurt anybody. I just don't like feeling this rage daily. I was much more laid back when I was getting stoned daily. Now I am itching for a fight to find its way to me. I don't know what to do. I don't like feeling this way, but I can't keep smoking pot because then I am never going to accomplish the things I want to accomplish in life. I'm so frustrated.  


Edit: It's worth noting: I have felt this way my whole life. It isn't just the absence of THC talking, its that THC always shut this voice up in my head. That's why I became so fond of the chemical in the first place: because I am a lover and I want to be a peaceful man by nature. I am not afraid of this part of myself, just that I would rather it not have such a grand place when I am participating in ordinary life. Once I am in the military, I am not so concerned about it.

My roommate has been saying for the last 2-3 weeks that he wants to take a “T” break. Today was the first day he was actually low on weed. We were sitting watching some football (Go Eagles) and he was smoking his pipe. It smelled nice, but I didn’t have any real cravings. He said, “I’m gonna smoke this bowl, get super high and super anxious, and then stop. Might pick up some CBD because it’s not the weed itself I’m addicted to, it’s the smoking. Anyway, I watched him finish his “last” bowl.... and no longer than 10 mins after he finished it he had decided that he was going to pickup again. No less than 20 mins later, the weed dealer stopped by. Also, he happened to come by right when my friend and I were in the final four left of a battle Royale video game, and he had to leave to go meet the dealer in his car, and so we lost the game which was a little annoying, I will admit. I also am struggling with some *minor* feelings of annoyance about him saying he will quit and then immediately picking up,  but I realize these feelings serve no positive purpose for me and really I shouldn’t be annoyed about it. 

I had some immense cravings and feelings of “fomo” but am happy to say I was able to prevent myself from picking up. Anyway, the point of this post is not at all to bash my roommate, he’s a really good person and has less of an addiction issue with weed than I do. However I just wanted to point out that what we are doing takes a lot of willpower and strength, and not everybody is willing to take this step.

It very quickly became a huge part of my life and I would smoke on weekends in the beginning and by 20 I was smoking everyday whenever I can. It just becomes part of your life and there is such a culture around it. A lot of my good friends also smoke weed everyday and for at least 5 years I have wanted to quit but never had the willpower to do it.

&#x200B;

I'm a comic and a writer and weed completely saps all my momentum. I realized that there is no rockbottom with weed. I am never going to lose my house and ruin all my relationships, but it does have a glass ceiling. It prevents me from actually making something of myself. I want a lot in this life time and weed just seems like its an anchor around my neck.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I think I ruined my brain, smoking all through my developing years, but I try not to think that way. I do not even think weed is inherently bad for you, it just my personal relationship has become very unbalanced and has encroached into an addiction.

&#x200B;

On top of everything I only would smoke spliffs (weed and tobacco) so I am quitting both substances at the same time.

Been smoking weed about 10 years now, I'm 33. First 2 years smoked joints only on weekends, with my boyfriend. He stopped smoking, paranoia was his problem, and did not wan't me to smoke, because he knew what it would do to my brain.

Then I smoked joints 5 years every now and then, but kept it hidden from everyone. After I smoked, waited 5 hours before go out public, because did not want to look like a stoner. I had my own apartment the whole time, still do. 
He was abusive, and the violance was vile. 

Got courage somehow and left that asshole finally, and met a new man, who was a stoner. Suprice, I thought it was great. What a mistake. 
Been smoking with him daily 2 and half years now. I smoke about 0,7 grams per day. And I use a bong, mix tobacco in the weed, and I smoke 10 full bowls a day.  

I kept a break from weed last spring, cold turkey, it lasted 6 weeks, I haven't felt that strong willpower in a while. It was quite easy to stop, but now I see the irony. Weed is patient. Relapsed, cos cheap weed came along.
Now I'm stopping, but it's really hard, because I'm doing all this alone, and he doesn't really seem to want to stop smoking. 
He has problems that he hid from me. I don't even know who I'm dating, haven't seen him clear headed not once, I mean, he's not stoned, cos he's got tolerance but he's not clear.. 

Now I haven't smoked for a week, because felt so sad that I have became an addict. Because i cant stop=addict. I need to take control while I still can. Weed cost 20 euros a gram in Finland, so alot of money wasted. 
Been a bitch since I stopped, moodswings, sweating the first 4 days and feeling strong hot's and cold's. Can't sleep and I'm so tired, and hunger for food is huge but it's good, could use a little meat on my bones. 
I feel nausea time to time, even when my stomach growls I cant eat. 

I did not even feel the highs anymore, just smoked because it was a habit. Felt nothing, even one beer made me feel more dizzy. I used to think weed is good, because of all that legalization, but it's a lie. It stops me from living my life. I have a part time job, but I want to go towards my dreams. And that man of mine.. Here is the real guestion, can he really do better, and will it last? We will see..
I even miss my ex sometimes, because he really did know what he was talking and cared at least. This current man is a hedonist, and only plays call of duty on free time and the sex is gone, I know u know what I'm talking about.
 
I want to stop smoking, because the main reason is that I don't want any of this mess anymore. Been numbing my problems with weed, digging the grave underneath me. 

Someone wise in here said, ""You can't open new doors with old keys.""  Been thinking that a lot. Can't wait to see my vivid happy dreams again, and looking people in the eyes, feeling the connection. I'm very sosial and I wan't more of that. And traveling with friends and having new hobbies. And my  parents are over 70, wan't to see them more often, make memories, I love them so much. And Halloween is coming, my favourite! Thank god my friends don't smoke, so that's good for me. Great to see all of you so supportive, this place helps, little bit struggling.

Firstly thank you all for helping me keep up for so much time.
I started smoking when I faced rejection in my love life. 
It helped in keeping my mind away from pain but made me stuck in that frame of mind for too much time ( a proper closure allows in moving forward)
Covid19 lockdown helped immensely as supply got cutoff and I did not go outside to buy because of infection risks. Also I moved back with my parents along with two siblings.
It has been quite difficult because living in a home with family leads to lot of friction and fights. So many times I have wanted to have a joint to keep these things off my nerves. Once I even dreamt of smoking and feeling the soothing effect of weed.
With the lockdowns opening everywhere the access to weed is restored for some time now but i have been successfully able to keep myself strong.

I have been cycling, cardio exercises provide similar soothing effect as of weed ( for much shorter span but a healthier alternative)

This is my first time posting on here personally, although I have commented on a few others posts. I want to thank everyone on here sharing their stories because it really helped to keep pushing me to get to where I am now. I had been a daily user for about 7 years since middle school, but today I am 3 weeks clean from any type of cannabis product. I work out now, I am more focused in my classes, & overall feel clearer and mindful. I have tried quitting many times before this attempt, as many of us here have & I just want to echo a few words that I always see on here: There will NEVER be a perfect time to quit. For me, this time was much easier because I eased into it with no weed supply, eating daily edibles and cutting down. If you want to try doing this, thats what worked for me. All in all I just want to say, don’t buy more just because “this week is going to be stressful” or “you have a lot going on” or “im just gonna cut down”. Buy some edibles & start your sober life if thats what you really want. Because buying more isnt gonna break the cycle you’re on. You have to want it.

Cheers to my sober life and a good life :)

This is long, doesn’t really offer anything to the world, but I need it, sorry.

I’m a shadow lurker, as I’ve never really posted on any public forum. I’ve been reading this sub and others throughout a sleepless night and have come to the sudden, jarring, and emotional realization that I have a severe problem. 

This could get lengthy as I’ve never discussed this with anyone, wife included and it may feel good to get it out. All this comes to a head as my marriage is in shambles and my career is in jeopardy. But, it could be much worse. Changes need to be made.

Started as everyone does, fun on weekends, when appropriate, and only small amounts if I bought any. I was in control, I would stop if it was a problem. Well the problem is you won’t know it’s an issue until too late. It was a gradual rise the first few months. Years later I now find myself going through 1/2 oz a week. It is to the point of me only NOT smoking to be “good” for work...time it accordingly (obviously b.s. but I rationalize it) Pre-commute at 4am, post-commute, and all evening at home. Weekends are a marathon of sitting around smoking and then bitching that I didn’t get anything done or that I don’t do anything I love to do.

I’ve had depression and anxiety issues all my life and started smoking to relax. My now wife had her mmj card back then when we started dating, and since then weed has been a part of my life. Funny thing is she doesn’t smoke anymore.

Here’s where it gets fun. I’ve literally been stoned for every major life decision I’ve made from 30 on up. Where did that get me? Anxiety, depression, regrets, resentment, and a bad habit of not taking responsibility for my decisions. Cross country moves, career changes, fights with family and friends...all of it under scrutiny by me now that I have had only a day sober. 

Each time I would make these decisions I was sure to be stoned. I thought it would clear my mind and I would make decisions true to my heart. Instead I just stopped really caring what happens, so long as we could pay bills, save a little for a home and I could smoke. I put the weight of decisions on my wife and I’d simply agree. Then I pass blame for my unhappiness. Totally asinine, reading this back to myself is upsetting.

Regardless I find myself at 40, questioning absolutely everything about my life and myself. 

Reading your stories has really awoken me to things. I’m done being a shell, crying (yes, waaay to much for anyone thats not an infant) and being unhappy but blaming everyone else. I tried a few hits at 4am today and the feelings of despair and depression were almost
immediate. 

At this point I’m rambling because it feels good.  That’s it, long but still just a small view of the mental soup sandwich that marijuana has been a part of.",27,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978182315826416}"

Before I start I just wanna say reading through posts and comments in this subreddit have helped me feel at ease so thank you all very much.

I'm 21 years old and used cannabis daily for 2 years, smoking around a gram a day. I've recently decided to quit as I have moved back to my university and the quality of weed here is terrible, meaning I don't even enjoy smoking and just get annoyed at how much money I'm spending.

It's day 3 since I went cold turkey, I wake up in the morning with a feeling of extreme anxiety in my stomach, which usually results in the feeling of nausea. This is annoying me as I want to start working on assignments but can't because of this feeling. I've been having trouble sleeping (Which I expected) and I have ZERO appetite. The combination of the anxiety plus lack of munchies means that I haven't been eating properly. Since day 2 I've probably only managed to stomach 300 calories.

 Day 2 was the worst, I woke up and threw up every 2 hours because of the anxiety. I ended up just trying to sleep as much as possible to escape the feeling.

Used to smoke randomly since 17, sometimes daily, sometimes once a week/month, it really depended on my work/school schedule, but never really screwed with my life. 

Past 2 years I have been smoking pretty much daily (in the evenings during weekdays because of work, all day on weekends), and all of a sudden it just doesn't give me the happy high it used to - well it does, for 20 minutes, followed by 2 hours of heavy paranoia, which I never had before (I did get paranoid, but nowhere near as much/often as I do now). Funnily, at the same time it stopped being as good as it used to, I felt the need to smoke weed for the first time in my life. 

To be 100% honest I just wish it went back to the way it was, as it has never really affected my life in a very (I would be lying if I said not at all - my memory went to shit, got moodswings every now and then and kept eating nonstop while high) negative way, but as of now weed is starting to feel more like a drug I need than a drug I want. That feeling scares me. Tolerance breaks made no difference, guess I gotta stop for good even though I don't want to. 

Didn't smoke for 9 days now, today I felt a (heavy) craving for the first time - mind you I live with a stoner and have really easy access to weed lying around pretty much all the time (free, to make it even more difficult), but still haven't smoked. 

Just decided to share to make sure I don't smoke tonight. 

Also a first positive effect I have noticed, since mentioning that apparently seems to help - I wake up really easily since day 3. 

Good luck to anyone trying to stop, gonna try with yall and see if my life improves in any way ✌️

before smoking, i had never had anxiety before so it was a huge adjustment and took a lot of getting used to. i hope with time, i will become less sensitive to stressful situations but i am glad i have gotten to the point where i know what to do to get rid of the anxiety. if you guys are also struggling with anxiety i recommend that you go for a walk outside and make sure you eat something. keep yourself out of stressful situations and know that that feeling is not permanent.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.990656316280365}"

Like many of y'all I've been using cannabis daily for years and need to stop. I love the stuff and am envious of people who can have a healthy relationship with it. I am just not one of those people. I have   tried to quit several times over the past 5-ish years of daily use and never succeeded. In the past, I have repeatedly deceived myself into thinking that I can just take a break and return to weed responsibly and with moderation. It's been sinking in lately that a healthy relationship with cannabis is probably just not in the cards for me, as I fall into the same patterns again and again of overuse and reliance. Getting high became a solution for every unpleasant feeling, bad day, or challenge in life. I am acutely aware that my dependence on a drug that tends to make me (or at least amplifies my tendency to be) lazy and apathetic is holding me back in life. I am limiting myself by continuing this way. I recently turned 30, and have reflected a lot on the last decade of my life. I have half assed basically everything, personally and professionally. There is more than just cannabis abuse at play here of course. However if I am to be honest with myself, I know that the way I use the drug does not bring out the best in me.

I don’t want my decisions to affect everyone else, and I respect and recognize that my friends don’t have the negative weed experience that I do. Unfortunately, more and more often, I find myself starting to feel a little bit resentful. I feel left out and they don’t really care.

Mentally I'm done with weed. I feel free...","Last night was a huge win for me. My mom was shaken up so bad. She doesn't understand weed and was asking if I wanted to move home and if I needed to go to rehab lol. I explained to her why I'd abuse marijuana and it comes down to short term gratification, not being discipled, taking the easy way out, and just coasting in life. However, even though I have been coasting, I've been getting promoted in my career and have only got outstanding reviews. I maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle and have saved up over 6 figures as a 29 year old. Inspite of all this, weed abuse still drove me to depression. The cycle is: get stressed and feel I can't be 'successful' -- smoke -- get low -- go sober --- be successful --- get overwhelmed --- abuse weed except this time I get lower --- rinse and repeat. It's been progressively getting worse which makes sense because I'm now 29 and turning 30 in 2 months and I'm wasting too much time.

I'm done guys. Like I'm fucking done. I'm SO READY to move on. I went to a psychologist and he prescribed me pretty strong anti depressants and after telling my parents about it, my mom made a good point of how doctors are quick to prescribe and how I should start therapy. I wanted to be honest with them and tell them that I am feeling abnormally low because of withdrawals and I don't want to get on anti depressants when my mind will start to lift in 2 months or so. So I told them about my weed abuse and they were taken aback, but, I told them it's huge for me to tell them. I told them it's in the past. I swore to my mother and more importantly, my grandfather who passed away 6 years ago, that I wouldn't smoke.

I'm ready for life. I'm ready to put in that work. There will be low days and low periods, but it's ok. I have family to rely on that I can speak to, I can work out, I can go for a walk, I can meditate, etc etc. I have so many tools at my disposal to deal with feeling low.

Man, there is so much to do in life. So much. Marijuana abuse holds us back so much. We cannot experience the ups and downs of life as intended because we lock ourselves in non-emotional zombie like cage.

So ive struggled with weed and other addictions for around 8 years. Weed is a real problem for me - i cant moderate, i binge eat, i do absolutely nothing productive when high. Yet quitting isnt really a problem - ive quit many times, my longest being 7 months, a few 2 or 3 months, and many smaller attempts. Basically ive realized it all comes down to my environment, and im not in a position to change my environment, so im seeking help...

My most recent quitting attempt was over the summer. I had smoked excessively from the UK lockdown - hell, what a great excuse to smoke weed and do nothing. My flatmate also smokes, as do a lot of my friends who live nearby. After a couple of months i felt depressed with this lifestyle,  lazy, unhealthy and fat. I was financially fucked due to furlough , and i had to return home to live rent free with my parents to prevent getting into debt. I decided to take this as an opportunity to stop smoking weed.

It was a great summer, and for the most part i stayed away from weed. I smoked twice in three months, and they were both special occasions so i didnt really feel bad about this, twice in 3 months felt like a healthy balance. I felt great, my mood was stable, and best of all i was so damn productive. Im a freelance musician and its really important for me to have a self-driven attitude and grab any opportunities that i can if i want to have a successful career. I started new projects with new clients, applied for some dream jobs and generally stayed pretty focused.

But eventually, i got my job back and had to move back in with my flatmate. I hadnt seen my friends in months, so i felt a smoke-up was well overdue. I was pretty sensible to begin with and only smoked on mondays and fridays, but this didnt last long. Its become pretty obvious that my friends are a bad influence - i was getting calls to hang out daily, and this resulted in daily smoking again. I still hadnt bought any weed after a month so still felt id kept it somewhat under control, that was until the classic routine of feeling bad that i was smoking others weed, and that i should buy some to contribute.

I had 3 days off this week. I spent them smoking weed all day, eating junk, jerking off and napping. I woke up today feeling guilty and depressed, and once again want to quit weed. The number of times i have had this thought loop of 'quitting, smoking occasionally, smoking others weed daily, buying my own weed, binging, repeat' is insane. I need to regain control, but i am not in a position to mive elsewhere. I wonder sometimes whether i should have moved city this year to make a change, but ive committed to being here for another year now. 

My flatmate is a good guy, but hes hopeless to talk to about this stuff. Ive told im before that i want to quit weed, but he always tries to convince me that i need to learn to moderate. I CANNOT MODERATE. If i have a day off and i have weed, it will be consumed whether i enjoy it or not, along with binging on anything else that makes me feel good.

So this is the problem - i cant moderate, and i want to quit. I have no problem with weed when im not around it, but as soon as im back in a weedy environment im fucked. Im gonna try to quit in the flat either way... my longest attempt of 7 months was in a weedy environment, so its definitely possible. But my god am i sick of this cycle.

Any tips or support would be hugely appreciated. Many thanks in advance",6,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9245414733886719}"

The first couple of weeks were challenging. Headaches, loss of appetite subsided after the first few days. I had lucid dreams for about 3 weeks, so getting a solid night's sleep was a challenge for me. 

What helped was keeping my mind busy. I worked A LOT. I put in many extra hours at my job because my job has always been one place I could never toke at. When I was off, I did stuff around the house like yard work, pressure washing, washing and waxing the vehicles, etc. I couldn't play video games for a little while because it would trigger me into wanting to smoke. Today, I no longer have that problem. 

It has been a journey much needed. For those looking to quit, my biggest advice is to break your routine and stay busy. Idle hands are the devil's playground. Don't set a goal for yourself as it will seem insurmountable and will discourage you. Every new day is a new goal achieved. Do these things and eventually you will find yourself at the 100 day mark. A sober timer really helps make the goals feel tangible and reminds you how far you have come.",7,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9914045333862305}"

What happened was not the high I was expecting, but the high that made me realise I'm just not into it anymore. The moment I vaped I started burping and having a stomach ache, which was one of the reasons why I quit weed in the first place. After I almost finished my vape bowl I just set it aside and kept it on my bag and didn't touch for the rest of the evening. I slept fairly well and today I'm not even thinking about it, aside from now that I'm writing this post.
All in all, the best high now is to do a small chore and have those chemicals in the brain rewarding you for a job well done, for having this clean headspace to do other things besides staying at home and being a couch potato.
I don't consider this to being a fail like many out here portray, I consider this to be a small personal victory, one that I can proudly say that I don't like weed anymore.

- Started getting bad panic attacks from too much and lowered the dose to 20mg about a month ago.
- Started getting scary chest pains and heart attack-like symptoms even on nights that I didn't take any.
- Stopped taking them entirely two weeks ago. Still getting all symptoms.
- Went to emergency room one night. Cardiac stats are perfectly fine, but doctor seemed unconvinced about withdrawal symptoms.
- Seen two doctors since and both have different opinions. One thinks it's just stress related anxiety and I should start anxiety meds and that the thc is unrelated. The other thinks that it IS edibles withdrawal and that by the time meds start to work the withdrawals will be over.

I am 23 years old, and have been using marijuana consistently since when I was about 16. Although I had some earlier experiences with it, due to an irresponsible father giving it to me as a means of sleeping. Anyway, due to COVID I have been unemployed, which allowed for a lot of time to sit around and smoke pot. I would say I was smoking about 3 grams a day for the last 6 or so months. Last week, I realized that I was being extremely lazy and unproductive and that I was able to justify it through my marijuana usage. It was also making me anti-social, as my roommate would have our friends over and more often than not, I would stay in my room just to smoke in peace. I don’t want to live this way anymore. I stopped for the full week (not including the weekend) last week, but on Friday, I had a few drinks with friends and then of course my inhibition was lowered and I immediately wanted to pickup, ended up picking up, and then picking up twice more. I stopped again this week on Tuesday and am hoping that I can stop for good. This community has been extremely helpful thus far. I just had a few questions. 
How do you deal with being around friends who are smoking? I’m sure it’s not intentional, but if I do choose to hang out in the living room my friends will be smoking a joint and just pass it around me, not knowing that I am truly struggling with quitting. (I do think there’s a tendency for people who are using to think that they could quit easily anytime, and so it’s no great feat for me to avoid smoking; while this could be the truth for them, it is simply not for me.) 
Another thing, sometimes I have these flashes of emotion or anger in which my brain goes “god damnit I don’t have anything to change the way I’m feeling right now.. I did see a post yesterday about how the uncomfortable times are where the most growth happens, but what do you guys do when u get those feelings? 
Also, have others found it’s nearly impossible to drink (albeit responsibly, not drinking to excess) without wanting to pickup? I can’t manage my cravings as well when I’ve had a bit to drink.

The first month was filled with ups and downs. Suicidally depressed laying in bed hating the person I am to the next day being overly confident and feeling like I could take on the world. It swung like this for about a month. I’m surprised I didn’t slip.

After about a month I realized I was starting to stabilize emotionally. My confidence was staying instead of coming and going, and my suicidal ideations began to drift away. I felt like I was at the beginning of a new me. I started to crave relationships and to work towards being a better version of myself. I knew I had a long road to go down but I felt like with time and hard work I could become the person I was meant to be without cannabis in my life.

I began to call friends again. I began to pick up the phone. Be able to be accountable to my friends and family which I had neglected for a long period of time.

The story doesn’t end too happy though.. I slipped visiting a friend in Colorado in March and began smoking.

At first it was okay.. I felt good about smoking again. It cheered me up and helped me bond with my friends. I felt good about slowly smoking weed again.

As soon as I got home though I went back to the races. Slowly starting to isolate myself back to a life of.. go to work, come home, smoke, watch Netflix, smoke again and then smoke some more. Meanwhile my phone is missing calls back to back. I didn’t want to hang I was perfectly fine being high and by myself.

A couple months went by and sure enough I had gone back to being miserable, full of shame, and alone.

So I quit again.

Moved into a new place right after I quit. Was starting the ball rolling again. Confidence coming back, friends called back this time, family not wondering what I am doing cause they haven’t heard from me in months.

That didn’t last either.. convinced myself to smoke about a month and half into quitting. And slowly but surely right here, right now.. I am right back at being alone, depressed, and seeking weed on a daily basis.

Weed makes it incredibly hard for me to maintain relationships with people including myself. I become isolated from the outside world and I know it does this to me yet I can’t quite seem to pull the trigger and not do it anymore. Now I’m sitting here thinking about how I haven’t called my friends in months, and how they are probably so fed up with me not returning their calls or reaching out. It’s not like I don’t love them I just get high and don’t want to talk or hang with anyone. And for the most part when I’m smoking.. I’m always fucking high. So I’m ALWAYS not seeking out friends and family. It has really taken a toll on my relationships in my life and I don’t know if at this point I can repair them. I’ve done this cycle for years and I think my friends are fed up with me. I’m sad that I’ve let this happen and that I can’t quit smoking weed. It’s hard. It’s my crutch. It’s the shitty life I have created for myself. And I’m having the hardest time letting this plant go.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9515565037727356}"

I wanted to touch base today to get your thoughts on the new ways people are trying to keep us hooked on THC. 

I have been sober now for 2 weeks and I will admit being quarantined for 3/4 months ( I live in the UK ) really did not help. I was basically stuck inside my house for months with my family but I am grateful we have our health and that the time has been spent getting closer to them. 

The reason why I mention that like some others, I am sure your family are not too please with the fact you smoke the devil's cabbage on a daily basis ( mine wasn't! ). It has some major setbacks, for example, the smell, coming back in from a 'run' with bloodshot eyes and no energy, having to sneak out to buy the stuff and so on. 

So, naturally, I set out to find some alternatives. And one day a miracle happened... I was introduced to 'THC VAPE JUICE'. I gazed at the bottle in awe as I received it thinking this is going to change my life. 

Anyway, 2 months of smoking the stuff go by and  I am told by one of my friends that what I am smoking in fact is not actually THC. It is a synthetic form of it ( not spice as it didn't make me act a weirdo ). Then I notice that I am completely losing my appetite, I would literally look at the tastiest food in pure disgust. In addition to that my sleep is completely broken, I wake up at 2:00 am, then 4:am then 5:30 am it was absolutely awful. 

Since my 'awakening' I have packed it in completely. I do still get the urges however I have thrown it all away to stop myself. The moral of the story is to KNOW what you're consuming! most people who smoke weed or thc do not even know what they are smoking and that is the biggest problem with it in the UK. Even flower buds can have pesticides and seeds all in it. I appreciate this may be different for people in the US where they have the proper testing facilities and trusted suppliers but please guys do your research before you turn something into a habit because it can really affect your life.

Its easier to focus.

I am a more enjoyable person at work for my colleagues.

Walking more with my dog and appreciating nature deeply.

I am building a social life, actually making an effort to have friends.

Starting to realise there is a huge beautiful world out there.

Increased awareness about my destructive way of self critiquing.

I have more love to give.

Increased will to quit sigarets.

Better quality of sleep and I have vivid dreams that I can remember now.

Eventhough my emotions are still definitely a rollercoaster and I still have a lot of personal work to do. Overall I feel happier.

A couple of years ago I met a guy and I instantly felt something. We worked together and soon began talking more and more, we eventually ended up seeing each other. I soon learnt that he had issues with substances in the past and he had been sober for many years, which I thought was amazing :)

We had so much fun together, he was the love of my life and I adored everything about him.
We would do things together, go out to eat, go fishing, spend time in nature and just enjoy each others company. 

Months passed, and it seemed almost too good to be true. We would never fight and we were best of friends until he reintroduced the weed back into his life. At first it was just to sleep and he would only smoke at night before bed, and a very minimal amount at that. Sometimes we would even share some and have a great night !
After a few months the weed became more easily accessible and he fell back into the cycle of smoking from the morning to the night and I followed in his footsteps.

The man I once loved began to turn into a careless and lazy person and I felt as if each day he was becoming more and more distant.
Life became all about smoking weed and it was all we did together to the point that we weren’t even being intimate because we were both too stoned out of our minds. We were both addicted and it was breaking us apart.

It seemed that with each day came a new issue or argument, we just didn’t seem to understand each-other anymore. He became mean spirited and seemed to enjoy tormenting me. Eventually I left 

I was now alone, and I had never missed someone so much. I began smoking more and more, smoking bongs all the time. What happened to him began to happen to me.
I became distant with my family and friends and I became lazy and felt so lost. Now I can see so clearly that marijuana changed us both to the point that we were no longer compatible.

I can’t help but feel so incredibly guilty about the person I became. I am so sorry to my family and friends that I may have hurt and I feel so embarrassed I let myself believe that weed was this harmless fix for my problems.

I am so beyond happy I found this support group and I thank anyone who takes the time to read this !x

Soo I've been smoking weed since I was around 13, I am now 21. It started off as me just smoking it casually with my mates every weekend or so until a year later i started to get into a rather heavy cycle of abusing it. 

It got to the point I was growing it, selling it and smoking upto around a half z a day with a friend or two for the next year or so. Me being a young, naive teenager never thought there would be any consequences to this as you've all heard ""weed is not addictive"" which in my eyes I now know is a load of s**t.

 Little did I know I was slowly losing myself, falling out of touch with what I was really like as a person.
I slowly became more introverted and started to develop bad anxiety problems, never felt like going out, socialising etc.

It must've been last year I finally realised that weed is doing nothing for me except for burning a big fat hole in my pocket and giving me some of the issues mentioned above. I've also realised that smoking it constantly makes you so content with life that you would be happy doing nothing but smoking it. I used to be so motivated and determined to push myself in life and it took me a long time to realise how I used to be.

From that day last year i decided to pack it in. I chucked all my stuff away, i told my family and friends too. I find it crazy that due to me quitting I basically lost a couple friends because that was the only thing that tied us together. All for the best though.

I've got to say quitting isn't easy, it's a constant fight with your inner self. When anything bad happens with work/family/friends the first thing I think about is going to get some and light one up to forget about everything.

Without doubt this past year has been a vicious cycle of going without it for 2 months (my longest ever) to smoking it every day again.

I turned 21 last month and had a good long think about sticking to quitting it this time so I joined this subreddit. Its lovely seeing everyone being supportive and it helps a lot reading everyone's stories. Here's to my first day, one step at a time.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9845927357673645}"

Every time I stop smoking for more than a day I inevitably have and autistic break down. That happened yesterday and I crashed my car because of it. I'm fine, only a stone wall and my car were hurt.

I am determined to stay off it this time, I have managed to get out of my usual cycle of intending to quit every day then giving up by the evening and I just downloaded a sobriety app to help me stay motivated.

I'm just so anxious, my misophonia has come back with avengance, every little thing is making me furious and I'm having panic attacks at the drop of a hat and there is nothing I can turn to to make it better.
I've been trying to get help from doctors for years for my mental issues but if it's not a quick fix they don't really seem interested in trying, which is a big part of why I resorted to weed in my teenage years.

I know I will be glad I quit eventually but what do I do until then? 😩

But I am quitting cannabis again. The last time I quit, which was 2 years ago it was for almost a year. In that time of 9 months I went from snowboard bum/anti-cop activist to becoming a state certified firefighter with HAZMAT Ops, Swift and Ice water rescue, First Aid/CPR certified, Wildland type 2 fire and was studying to become a pumper driver/operator. I achieved higher scores on my tests than 80 percent of the academy, who were all 20 year olds. Passed every single physical test required.   


Then I saw my 6th dead body and decided fuck it, life is short. I went to my exes house and smoked. I felt so weird. Not like it did when I get high, but something like a Salvia body trip coupled with light anxiety. That was over a year ago. I am no longer a firefighter because I broke my leg and tore my MCL slightly after leaving a friends house. After smoking of course. Had I not been smoking, I would never have been at this person's house and never have broken my leg. Now I smoke daily again. Dabs and flower. Yesterday I scraped my bong and was smoking disgusting residue that barely got me buzzed.   


So, let's do this again, and this time for good. Day 1. I am jittery already, and I am anxious. I worry about my willpower, but I shouldn't.  I quit every drug I was ever addicted to. Alcohol after 20 years, Nicotine after 10, and for a very brief stint as a young man, meth. All of these things refused to hold their sway on me, however none of those things have been such a part of my life, and culture and perception of self. I have always been a stoner. I have always been a part of cannabis culture and the fight for legalization. Leaving all that feels like abandoning a part of who I am. But, I cannot continue letting a recreational and medicinal drug define my existence.

I always wanted to not be dependent on it and I wanted eventually to have a ""healthy"" relationship with it. I'm happy that I have the ability to have it and not go straight back into the cycle.


*However* I don't even know why I've done it. I don't find it enjoyable and the night is spent keeping the buzz going. There's no real joy to it more just compulsion for the night. If I had some at home if probably feel the hangover the next day and smoke all day. Luckily I haven't gone out and got any so I've kept the boundary up.


Each time I get a bit of a hangover the next day and a couple of days after I get quite anxious. So I don't know why I even have it considering I don't enjoy it, it has negative impacts and I'm probably risking relapsing into my old ways each time.

So, started buying regularly my freshman year of college (2012) and have been cruising comfortably (or so I thought).  Life has been okay, nothing to brag about, but I felt happy.   I got laid off at the start of covid, which was actually nice because I was planning to quit my job and unemployment was not too shabby.  Saved a good amount of money and I also started dating someone I really love. 

Recently, I had to get a tonsillectomy due to constant sore throats and it forced me to give up smoking due to complications it can cause.  Unfortunately, the surgery compounding on not smoking, I feel unmotivated to do much.   I don’t plan on starting again, but being sober is reminding me how lazy I can get and how I did not develop many healthy habits after college.

I know a decent amount of successful people who toke regularly, so I try to justify it to my self every chance I can.  I would love to do it in the future once I feel more comfortable in my career, but who knows.

I finally mustered the courage to quit FOR GOOD on April 20th (ironic) and was able to not smoke, not touch it at all all the way until about 2 weeks ago. 

It was a terrible habit to kick and boy did I experience withdrawal and could not eat for awhile. I managed to not think about it and I felt like my life was moving on for the better. I started a new job and I have felt so productive. 

Flash forward to two weeks ago and I allowed myself to have a puff from a joint. Now, I think that restarted my urge somehow. I bought some joints over the weekend that just passed and managed to smoke 5 joints in 2 days. I don’t know why, I just kept going back to back for them. It made me realize that I really don’t have any limits with this and I can’t casually do it.

I am beginning to revitalize friendships and relationships with family members, and am slowly starting to open up again and force mysef to talk to strangers. I never realized how weed made it okay for me to be bored and spend waaay to much time alone until now. It made me okay with staying home all day, or most of the day. It made me want to smoke by myself and it made me really selfish. Now having to ‘feel’ that boredom and emptiness at home, even after being active with my day, I began to feel sad and lonely and it made me miss connecting with friends and loved ones. So I am now making an effort to open up again and connect with people and it feels badass :) It’s definitely hard but I end up fighting the discomfort off when I socialize and end up feeling relaxed.

Thankful for this subreddit, for books, my jump rope, comedy podcasts, and my skateboard for helping me cope. I can finally say I’m done with that stage of my life, and y’all’s stories made me want to keep fighting and sticking to this.

I’m choosing to quit for good because smoking is killing my career goals. I get no work done past 5 because I’m instantly getting high once I think I can justify it. I feel like my brain is permanently clouded. What little impulse control I had gained over the few pre-Covid months has been shatters. 

It’s purely coincidence that I’m making this post on 10/1. I’d been planning it for months but every time I ran out I would find a new reason to pick up “just one more time”. 

But now I’m done. I’m here for good. Getting through the morning/afternoon won’t be the hard part. It will be at night when I have nothing to do. 

I guess the only good(?) news is that I woke up with a sore throat and think I could have COVID. I’m in the process of getting a test scheduled, but having to quarantine until then will be a good incentive to not pick up. 

I do want to thank this subreddit, even if nobody reads this rambling and slightly incoherent post. Seeing it pop up everyday reminded me that I had problem. It made me feel guilty, like I was cheating myself and everything I cared about. 

If anyone cares about my progress I’ll update this post this evening. 

Love you guys, stay strong!

Update: Thanks to everyone who upvotes and comments, makes me feel like I can’t let you down. This is normally the time of day where I would be high out of my mind.

Since the age of 14 I've smoked every day (now 23). I once stopped for a couple months, a couple times limited myself to only evening smoking, but every goddamn time I subtly work my way back up to smoking all day every day. It does and doesn't make sense to me. It's such an easy escape, seemingly harmless compared to other escapisms, but it has sucked the life out of me. I've lost touch with reality, developed intense paranoia, isolated myself from many people, given up genuine pursuits in the things I'm interested in, and a number of other shitty side-effects. The things I thought I had been gaining from weed became a debt that I could never pay back. I couldn't see it before, denied it, tried to justify or reconcile, etc. etc. I couldn't admit to myself I had a problem until I began to notice how negatively I was impacting my partner. I watched the distance grow between me and the last relationship I cared about at all about. It sucks. I couldn't be there for the person I care about most and it sucks beyond what internet words can convey. However, this gut-wrenching realization pushed me to pursue actual support. I started poking around this subreddit and attended my first MA meeting and am now getting serious about getting clean. I want to stop using, for good.

Almost everyday I would have 1 or 2. The problem was that I lived in the dorms so I had to walk about 10 min to get to a safe place to smoke. I also had to roll the joint. Overall it just took a lot of effort to get high so I saved it for the end of the day usually and I think that’s what kept my lifestyle in balance. I recently moved to Colorado and got my own apartment. After buying a bong and weed from a dispensary it became so easy to just pack a bowl and smoke on the balcony.

Threw away my bong I had for like 7 years (even through 4 of probation while my friend kept it safe for me) and gave away my $200 grinders.,"I really didn’t know if I was going to be able to stop. Before I got in trouble (non weed related) I never had any of the issues I developed when I started back up. After I got off paper, I didn’t smoke for like a month. But fond memories and the relatively harmless nature got me back into it, then boom I was high for 10 months straight. I was always able to get clean piss from a friend for pre-employment screens, but always worried about randoms. And even being able to get clean piss, it was so stressful trying to get a new job and fake out the piss test nurses and stuff. 

When I began this journey I had quit 3 jobs in a row because they were dead end or I wasn’t getting acknowledged for my quality of work, the amount of time I did it in, or the amount of work I did. I am a welder. Sitting around the house with nothing to do, hardly any friends, feeling depressed about how I’ve wasted 10 years of my life for various reasons and in various ways, made it seriously almost impossible. 

The first day was hell. Literally every second wanting to smoke. The days never got better until I hit a week which felt like some minor accomplishment. I hadn’t even been able to go a day voluntarily ever. Like EVER. If I had weed, or money to get weed, and someone to get it from, then I was smoking. I’d take like a .2-.5 rip about 2-5 times a day. I only smoked flower and the highest potency I could get. 

I started to lose weight, I think because my brain got overloaded with dopamine by weed and didn’t care to get any from food. I’ve always been in above average shape and condition and this really fucked with my head to see my muscles and strength and stamina disappear and even my body fat. I got down to 143lbs (I’m 5’9”) but I never even weighed that much since like 8th grade. (I’m 29 now.) Being unemployed I have had no way to get any supplemental protein, creatine, or nitric oxide boosters, or pay for a gym membership. It seemed I was stuck. I thought to myself countless times “I’ll take a day off” and it never happened. There was always an excuse or something that drove me to smoke out of frustration or anger or happiness. 

My lack of control of my use, and the physical effects it has had on my body are the main reasons I quit. I’ve never been in trouble because of weed. It’s never stopped me from doing anything or learning. So it was very hard to justify to myself why it was bad for me. This kept the cycle going. 

I either full out lost my ability to derive happiness from anything, or it was greatly diminished. Music wasn’t the same, activities I enjoyed weren’t the same. And when I quit it only amplified this effect at least temporarily. 

All the chips are stacked against you when you quit. We live in a society that is inundated with substance use and weed is a big one. And in itself it is really relatively harmless. It has many pros even. And for some no negatives. But for others, negatives can develop. This happened for me, somehow, without me noticing until it was too late. 

I think I used it to cope with depression and a sense of unfulfilled aspirations, and feeling like I’m too far behind to even start in some senses. I’m 29 and didn’t graduate college but went to private school my whole life and am pretty intelligent, and have not held a job for longer than a year for whatever reasons. I cannot place the blame on cannabis solely, but it was surely not helping and has been an aspect to some of my shortcomings.

I am extremely hard on myself and tend to make small things into big things. I am my fiercest critic. I beat myself up so bad about shit. Cannabis helped me to not do that so much. It helped me to let go of these feelings somewhat. Now that I’ve quit, I have nothing to do this for me. I have to take it all on full bore and it’s very hard sometimes. 

At this stage, I don’t think of it often, but it’s often brought up to me via one medium or another. Be it in passing conversation, memes, friends, people I play COD with ripping it in the background, etc. When this stuff occurs it passes very quickly and I haven’t really had the urge to smoke. What I DO have is thoughts that maybe I was in such a psychosis due to depression and shit and heavy weed use that I read too far into my own issues, as I have a tendency to do. I for sure blamed weed for things that now I see had nothing to do with weed. Which makes me think “maybe at some point in the future I can smoke again and not have these issues.” Sitting here now I still think this way and am not sure which way to lean. 

I am 100% done for a good while. But I’m not 100% convinced there will never again be a time and place in my life where I can “safely” use it again. 

I don’t drink anymore, never desire it. I do desire the same feelings I’d get during times I used to use alcohol, mostly in social scenarios. However the past 5+ times I’ve attempted to have a couple beers or even just one shot of liquor, I am disgusted by its taste and the effects are not desirable. I do not enjoy losing my motor skills and shit. I feel like unhealthy trash and hungover when I drink, even a couple hours after doing so. 

Now I am stuck with a nicotine addiction that seems unbreakable. I was sub ohm vaping the highest strength salt nic though and I did manage to quit that but only to drop down to like half a pack of cigarettes a day and now I’m down to like 2-3 black&mild’s. 

I’ve decided to not even attempt to curb this addiction until my piss is weed free. I’ve been testing myself for the past 2 weeks because I thought at my current body fat ratio and metabolism rate I would maybe be clean in 2 weeks. False. Tried again last Sunday which marked 3 weeks, I think I maybe saw a faint line but didn’t want to trust it. So I will try again this weekend. It is really disheartening to be hoping so hard to be clean and then not being so. I just want to be able to walk in any job and be able to piss all over the place without fear of failing for weed. 

I have a good friend I met in jail that used to be a meth head, and he has been clean for probably 2 years now. Although he is on probation still, that is an accomplishment I look up to him for. He is like 4 years younger than me but I have leaned on him for support in this time. If he can kick fucking meth than I can kick weed right? We have worked together but the job didn’t hire me full time due to politics with the other shift’s manager who had it out for me since day 1 of me working there. I produced better quality work and at a faster rate than his guys and guys on my shift and it really sent me on a downhill skid when they told the staffing agency January 2nd 30min before my shift that I didn’t have a job there anymore. Ever since then I’ve been on a downhill slide. Fell deep into weed use and every job I’ve had since has been shit and not worth staying at, except one, that didn’t want to pay me fairly. They tried to hire me permanently after just a month of me working there, had me specifically doing work for customers that wanted high quality work for structural steel, had me doing jobs without the proper equipment and I still got them done to high levels of quality, yet they wouldn’t even raise my wage at all when they tried to hire me on so I told them to shove it up their ass. This job was 2min down the road from where I live and I got an hour lunch every day. I sometimes feel I messed that up, but someone has to teach these people they can’t just use and abuse everyone and not show them any thankfulness at all. My line of work is one where nobody can help you, and lots of guys don’t progress past a certain level. Those that do are often taken advantage of. I think I may try to go back there once my pee is clean, but idk. 

All I know is if I don’t get something good that gives me incentive to stay clean, I’m not sure I am strong enough to stay clean. Life is such a magical mystery with so many facets and aspects. Sometimes it’s just too much. I’ve felt like giving up frequently on everything over the past 4-5 months. No job, no significant other, and no hope. 

Somehow I have managed to make it this far in my journey and I hope anyone else in my shoes can do so as well. 

I don’t know what the future holds for me. I just want to be successful and make enough to support myself. I just want to be happy. I want to be able to have other hobbies I can indulge in but they take money. 

This turned out longer than I intended, but I hope some people read it. Believe me, if I can make it this far, anyone can. Good luck and Godspeed.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989632368087769}"

Pros: One thing that had been good about quitting weed is my productivity has been on the up.  I am actually focusing on my classes, taking notes and while i still need to get my homework done i just feel better about school and the things I’m doing in my life.

Things that are still hard:  my anxiety is still really high, i have troubles sleeping bc I’m thinking about things that i need to get done for the next day or possible scenarios that could happen.   I was really depressed yesterday but today has been better, just trying to get the most out of quitting.  

I just want to let all of you people just making the choice to quit, its a hard road but only even after day 12 it feels worth it.  I hope you guys make the choice to better yourself and not be stuck on a substance that brings you down...

I've been waiting to post because no matter how well things were going I just knew that I would slip up again. 

Until today.

My sleep cycle is off and my energy levels are all over the place. One day I feel like exercising after work and going out to do something, the next I can hardly go through the motions and feel intense body pains. The dreams are bizarre, very surreal dreams mostly in which I'm with old friends I haven't seen in years. When I awake there's no going back to sleep, I always wake up drenched in sweat. I'm lucly if I'm averaging 4 hours of real sleep a night. 

These symptoms and general anxiety when I have nothing going on are the only downsides though. Psychologically I feel better than I've ever felt in my life. The cravings aren't very strong anymore when they do pop up I'm able to shake them off pretty quickly .

Anyway, I feel like I'm rambling. Just wanted to share that I'm over the one month hump and cant wait to start checking them off a month at a time instead of a day at a time.

Best of luck to you all and I will share again when I've got month 2 under my belt.",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9871941208839417}"

2 weeks clean today after smoking daily for 4 years. The first 3 I was smoking at night or with friends, but for the last year I really let things get bad. For the last 6 months I threw everything in my life away except for weed. Nearly flunked out of college, let go of all my friendships, hobbies and interests. My life was going to class when I had to, going the bare minimum on homework and smoking the rest of the time.

I say all this because recently I was telling my therapist that for the first time I felt like I was choosing sobriety, not just forcing myself not to smoke. Since I'm thinking more clearly, I realized I could choose the life I described above. I could work full time doing some meanial nonsense and smoke the rest of the time and eventually die. No friends, hobbies or relationships, but none of that matters when I'm high. There were many days where I thought I wanted that, as long as I could keep getting high it would be okay.

My therapist said that he isn't here to judge, and there's nothing wrong with choosing that life, as long as it's an intentional choice. It wasn't a choice for me, it was almost automatic, as I'm sure you all can relate to.

Hearing that really helped, it's helped me feel like sobriety is an affirmative choice, and it feels so good to finally be making choices. I hope this helps someone else out there

Best of luck to all of you, friends.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9671249985694885}"

Then I proceeded to fly home and smoke it up like nothing was different even though a week prior I had smashed all my paraphernalia and sold all my drugs.

I got back to town, hit up a dealer, got some papers, and started smoking joints.

Well now I'm going on day 11 after almost committing to quitting 5 years back.

It's surreal.  I'm trying not to dwell on how I almost quit back then and instead just focus on the now and how my mindset has changed.
