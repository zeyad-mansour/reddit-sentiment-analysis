I have a story, possibly one that you've heard 200 times already. The story of how I started smoking to have fun, and now I'm trying to quit because it took a lot from me.

I started smoking around 2002 and was an on/off user until the year 2012 when I was able to find a reliable dealer who was always there for me and taught me many ways to smoke and enjoy the high. Since then, I've smoking almost daily, several times a day... I was doing about 1oz per month. I should have been visiting a psychologist. I wasn't having fun. I was constantly trying to escape from myself and the anxiety (about 2 years ago I was officially diagnosed with depression, and since then been on treatment). During this time, I got divorced (she was sick of my lack of drive to improve and tired of my sadness), I lost a great job due to being a slack and many friends who were not into it.

I lost it. I lost control, I became addicted to the act of smoking (the weed had always been mild since I couldn't afford anything stronger) to the point of excusing myself during meetings, during family dinners, during the time I have with my 3-year-old to have a hit. I am a teacher, and I saw myself turning off the camera during zoom sessions to smoke just a bit.

This is the 3 time I try to quit. I've taken some extra steps that I didn't in the past, such as deleting the contact info of any known dealer, getting rid of anything drug-related in my house, and writing. Writing a lot, writing everything that is going through my mind.

Today is day 3 of not smoking. Weed withdrawal is real, the symptoms suck, and it was the excuse I always had to have ""just one more hit. I am angry, I am anxious, I am sad and I am hopeful.

I am here, seeking your help to get back on track and be the best version of myself I could dream to be, because I have a beautiful son and I just want to be the type of dad he deserves.

Thanks for reading. I can't really sleep, so I hope I can read you back and tell you in a few weeks, that I am still fighting, and that seems like I'm winning.

Love. J

It's funny--I don't want to smoke, but I don't know what to do with the buds.  He's gifted me before and we would talk taste, smell and effect, so I know he will ask me about it later.

2020-11-29 20:14:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k3lpt2/30_weeks_paws_update/,30 weeks! - PAWS update,"*TL;DR: PAWS is now slowly slipping out of sight, I’m beginning to feel good as weeks pass & am excited for the future without flower* 



Well, I made a promise to myself a while ago that I’d update at 30 weeks give or take how things are going. I’m hitting 7 months clean in 2 days. I feel great about reaching this milestone! For the first time in my stoner career, I’ve been clean for this long & have not looked back at using again. Cravings come, but just as they set, they leave. My PAWS now is very weak, not near 100% yet, but I’m feeling more or less at 85-90% of the way there. 

Current symptoms:

Tinnitus:  (gone during the day, mainly gone but is there when it’s very quiet in my room at night & only if I fixate on it) 

Body aches/pains: this was here & there the first 4 months, then for the past 2 I’ve felt it get bad, pretty bad, to eh, to tolerable. It is now just associated with high intensity sports as I play soccer. 

Anxiety: was mainly gone for 4-5 months, came back in month 6 but has been very random & extremely tolerable. Easy to diffuse. But, feels like a weird, fuzzy feeling in my stomach or chest randomly. 

Brain Fog: this had surfaced in month 5 after exercising, it comes & goes now & it can be associated with poor sleep sometimes. However, I can work through it & go about my day just fine with it. 

Insomnia/Sleep Disturbances: since day 1 of my quit, I’ve had some awful sleep. Months 1 to 3 saw disturbances with waking every 2-3 hours. Now it seems as if my sleep is slowly bouncing back. I get 3 or so nights where I sleep a full 7-8 hours (which is fine to me, I was never much of an oversleeper) then I get hit with 1 night where I wake every 2-3 hours. This is fine. I am up by 8-9am anyways. I feel that as the weeks & months pass, this will begin to adjust. Just very slowly. 

Brain zaps: first 3 months was full of this, now it randomly comes but extremely weak. I dont mind it much anymore, I just know my brain is trying to correct smaller pathways now which could just be itself correcting any damage left. 

Muscle twitches/spams; for 4-5 months this was ranging between really bad to moderate, now it is slowly leaving me. Very faint as well. Talk about a highly disrupted CNS. 

Visual issues (snow, distortions, lights, afterimages): this as well has recently been somewhat of an issue but is slowly getting better. Somedays I notice a lot of floaters, other days I get very heavy & painful eyes, but nonetheless, manageable. 


I’m so happy to make it this far! It’s been tough but I’ve managed through it all. I know it is only going to get better & I have to let time do it’s thing. We are all very unique, & with PAWS, each experience is very different. However, not everyone gets PAWS. I just got dealt some pretty difficult cards but hey, that’s life. Not everything will always be easy. I turn 22 in 2 weeks, & being sober for it will be great in its own. Lastly, I’ve found a girl. She’s great. She knows about my struggle, & she is fully on board to keep me away from using. She makes me extremely happy & I’m glad that in the midst of so much darkness, I have my own little light by my side.

My mind is running and I start to feel pressure in my chest because of anxiety. This was the reason why weed seemed so appealing.

What’s up everyone, been a while since i’ve been on here, i broke and started consuming again. This past 2 weeks i went on a vacation, knowing i wouldn’t be able to smoke that much (illegal state) i brought 10 300mg chocolate bars. daily i was having 1 for breakfast no questions asked, some days i’d push 600-900mg. By the end of the trip my 300mg baseline was now my sober feeling. After the trip i instantly cut off use, and i instantly fell into the worst and longest panick attack of my life. I feel so de personalized since seizing use, i feel out of body, my anxiety is 24/7. Just wondering if this is because of the edibles or some life stuff. Anybody who has experienced please share what happened to you, and how long it took to return to “normal”. Currently quitting all weed (continuing non thc  use for smoking habit reasons) and hoping in a week of being sober i’ll slowly come back.

I wanted to write something when i got to the month mark. This community was a fundamental pillar in staying away from weed, reading about your success and failures, there was something to learn in everyone of you.

This was my experience, i hope someone can get something good from it:

First week, i was really depressed, i was in my lowest point, feeling unmotivated and having a volatil state of mind. Whenever i wanted to smoke i come here and read some post to keep me going. I conviced my self that all the dopamine i generate from smoking created receptors in my brain that were asking for that stimulus, so that was the reason i was depressed. I kept saying to myself that i need to give my brain time to balance his chemical's, TIME.

20 day mark, i felt a lot better, of couse you want to smoke, but the fear of relapsing and feeling like shit after the first puff just kept me away from it.

Month free, i dont have any kind of remind of weed in my house, i clean a lot more and cook also, my grades went up, and work is still preety much the same, but i really feel better, like i got a big weight out of my shoulder´s, also now i know that i didnt need weed to see a movie or go to the park o listen to music, everything is the same.

Something that help me was keeping record of the days weed free, i download an app and waited to the end of the day to update the record, it was like a small succes in everyday.

Hopefully my story helps someone. 

First, my background so you know where I'm coming from. Smoked daily for 6 years straight before marrying my wife, and went clean cold turkey because we moved to a new area where I had no hookups. Once I started traveling for work to legal states, I relapsed and went back to daily vaping concentrates, which I hid from my wife. Then my state legalized so my use only got easier to maintain, while it became harder to hide from my wife who was pregnant by then. My son was born at the start of the pandemic, and the stress of parenting in quarantine ramped up my dependence. I had several breakdowns before I realized my using was only digging me deeper and masking real mental health issues. I started therapy and an antidepressant at the recommendation of my doctor.

After about 3 months clean with no looking back, I can give you some insight.

First of all, you need to want to be clean. Not just ""I can't afford this habit, so I should quit"" because you'll find a way to pick up a bag and there goes the cycle again. You have to accept and convince yourself that this is something you can't do anymore. I **LOVE** cannabis, it is my favorite thing, always will be. But I had to decide my family was worth more, and realize that I wanted to be happy again. 

The biggest difference for me from sober to addiction was how *good* simple things feel again. I hung christmas lights this week, a chore I would normally dread. While I wasn't stoked to get started, once I was done there was a sense of content and satisfaction that I previously longed for. I was getting high just to feel good, and it got to the point that only getting high made me feel good. Literally nothing else, including watching my son grow up, made me happy. That realization was what made me decide to change. 

I had to accept that this shit was not good for me and not sustainable, and the pain I felt from not being able to enjoy my life and family was enough to push me to get clean. Sometimes it takes a great deal of pain or conflict to force someone to change. That's what it took for me, and I hope it doesn't take that for you.

I think what I'm saying is, don't hit near rock bottom like I did. Accept that this habit is bad for your mental health, accept that it's going to be difficult to quit but not impossible, and convince yourself that you can quit if you try. Remind yourself that once your brain readjusts, you will start to feel actual joy again, often about silly little things. Your life will have more meaning, and you'll have motivation to pursue important and life-fulfilling goals and dreams.

I don't want to stress myself out by saying I'll never use cannabis again in my life, but I have ZERO desire to go back to it.

I think the 20+ years of smoking weed were a form of ""self-medicating"" for the see saw of depression and anxiety. Little did I know, the weed was merely covering up the symptoms, and was keeping me feeling mellow and complacent so I never felt the inner push to look at the root causes. 

Things that have helped me stay off the bong:
-eating decently (I'm no health nut, but I shy away from fast food and junk food whenever possible)
-getting outdoors (walks, hikes, runs, getting out into water, or floating on top of it)
-meditation (a quick 10 minutes with a guided meditation app: I recommend ""Waking Up"", ""10% Happier"", ""Headspace"", or ""Calm"" -- all good; each has strengths and shortcomings)
-exercise (weights, yoga, tai chi, HIIT)
-relationships (really showing up for people, clear-headed and attentive, with heart -- the people in my life are what keep me sane and bring me joy)

Check how inherited family trauma plays a role.,"Growing up, I had a parent who was secretive about their pot use and I hated them for it. I was angry at them as I noticed the smell in the basement covered in air freshener and perfume and I vowed to never be like them. A decade later in college as an adult, I found myself doing the exact same thing. I was invited to go hang out with classmates after lectures and I always found a reason to say no. I, too, had my secrets. Eventually one joint a week turned into daily use, before I ate, before I hiked, before I slept, before I enjoyed anything. I would always want to quit when I had plenty of pot in stock and when the stock ran to its last joint, I unconsciously knew I would go out and get more.

2020 has changed all of that. I focused on healing and uncovering the root causes of why I smoked even though I didn't want to anymore. I learned about inherited family trauma that goes back 2-3 generations and how the unconscious insists, repeats, and practically breaks down the door to be heard. The only way I could resolve it would be to hear it, invite to the room, and locate the origin in the past that might not even belong to me, but rather a family member. Once I was able to comprehend that I was being loyal to that pot-smoking relative, I felt released. 

2 months later and I still feel unchained to pot use. The thoughts I had before about not ever being able to sleep properly again dissipated. I feel so connected to family, friends, and myself than ever before. I am not responsible for fixing my family's trauma as that's their work and this work on myself could only be assigned to me.

Now that it's been over a month of not smoking, I cook all the time, think through my thoughts more clearly, confront problems head-on with better communication skills, go to bed early, dream ultra vividly and get to live out awesome and wild experiences in my dreams and wake up feeling human again. I am saving money, getting up earlier to enjoy the stillness of the morning and drive out to see the sunrise. I no longer have the fear of being pulled over and having it in my system as it stays in there for months even when you're not high.

I feel free. I feel like I can do this. I read your stories and I know a better life is possible for me and you.",48,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9637158513069153}"
2020-11-29 10:06:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k3atdx/day_4/,Day 4,"Hey guys. This is day 4 for me. Quitting weed is probably the hardest thing I've ever done but I'm determined to get through it. Early in the morning after Thanksgiving my cat passed away and it made me realize how life is too short. I know Kingston would want me to be happy which means quitting weed. The weird thing about weed for me is that from the first time I tried it, about a couple years ago, I've never understood it. It never made me happy or funny or calm. It has always just felt like a numbness to me and maybe that's why I can't do it. In the beginning, I would only smoke every once in awhile and didn't really feel anything from it. Then I got my pen. It was amazing for the first month. It was my baby and I brought it everywhere. But I started to use it more and more and my self-esteem, which was already pretty bad, just went completely downhill. I was dating a guy at the time that I never would've stayed with if it hadn't been for weed. The first time we had sex, and the very first time for me, I was not even conscious. Both of us overdid it with weed and alcohol. He treated me like absolute shit and when he broke up with me, I realized I had no idea who he was. The weed definitely contributed to me thinking this relationship was more than it was and I didn't realize till the end that he could've actually cared less about me. However, this was my first serious relationship so I was a complete mess for about a year after the break-up. I started using my pen even more which just made my anxiety and depression go through the roof. I hated myself so much and I was prepared that I would have to kill myself eventually. I knew I was digging myself into a hole and I kept digging I think because I knew it would be harder and harder to climb back up. And I think I really wanted to die. Life seemed way scarier than death. It got to the point where I was just smoking and sleeping all day. Most days I wouldn't even get out of bed. I couldn't talk. Even just saying a few words to my family seemed so pointless. Finally, it was time to go back to school; I went to college at the time which was about 4-5 hours away from home. My whole life I have been close to my family and leaving home was the most stressful thing for me. Going back to university, I can't even remember moving in that much; I don't know if that was from the weed or me just blocking it out of my mind. I didn't know what to do though and I just remember crying the whole way and begging my mom to take me back home. I brought my supply of weed up there because I wouldn't have been able to go without it. I had several carts but ended up smoking way too much and they were gone within 1-2 weeks. I was basically forced to quit up at school because I always got my weed back home. This was one of the hardest parts of my life. I went from basically being always high to cold turkey. I didn't mean to do it this way but I couldn't control it. For months, I couldn't sleep and I could barely eat. I was so extremely anxious and whenever something bad happened, I would have a complete break-down. I now realize that weed doesn't allow you to deal with your shit. Everything seemed like such a big deal and it made life so scary. I had 0 assertiveness and confidence and felt completely not in control of my life. I had to find some kind of replacement for weed because I didn't know what else to do and that, sadly, was alcohol. I got my hands on some and started to drink every night. At first, just 1-2 drinks. Then, I started to get black-out drunk every night. I would watch sad shows and look at old pictures and just cry. I thought it made me feel better but I felt terrible and my poor body. I was still barely eating anything and lost a lot of weight and basically the only thing I was consuming was alcohol. Then break came, I went back home, and things got slightly better just because I felt more comfortable at home. But then I had to go back to school. I knew I couldn't do another semester like the one before and decided to drink almost an entire 1.75 liter bottle of Bacardi. I don't know how I woke up the next morning. I was supposed to work early but I also wasn't supposed to wake up. I freaked out because now I would have to deal with the aftermath of my decisions. After that, my mom forced me to come home and I took the semester off school. This was the first stage of my healing. I was still drinking and smoking a lot but at least I was safe at home. My mom was my best friend and got me to go out and do things once again. I went to Brazil with my second mom, meaning I also had to quit weed for 2 weeks, which was really hard, but I started to find myself again. Then I met my boyfriend, we'll call him Joe. Everything changed when I met Joe. He is the best thing that has ever come into my life. I went from feeling sad and anxious everyday to oozing happiness. He loves me so much, flaws and all, and showed me what a real relationship was. We both struggle with the same mental health issues and weed addiction. But we are determined to be happy and live our lives fully. I don't know if I believe in God or not but after I met Joe, everything made sense. Everything I had gone through and done in the past was meant to happen so I would be with him. I know that he's my person and I don't know what I would do without him. He made me want to live again and try to be better. I had given up before but slowly, with Joe, I have been healing. We are both staying sober from alcohol and weed. And in a way, I'm kinda thriving now. Sure, I have my issues still but I'm twice the person I was before. I can deal with stuff and stick up for myself, things I've never been able to do before. It has not been easy but life's not easy. I think I wanted it to be smooth sailing but to appreciate the ups, you have to go down sometimes. And when I'm not smoking weed, the goods far outweigh the bads. If you would've told me a year ago that I was alive and happy, I would've never believed you. I have made a lot of dumb decisions in the past so the fact that I'm here now, I am eternally grateful. I love my life so much now. I love my family, my boyfriend, my animals, and even work is getting better. Sorry this is such a long post but I just wanted to share my story for anyone out there that doesn't think they can make it. YOU CAN. YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH. I know you can't see it now but the universe DOES have a plan for you. And I promise one day it will all make sense.

ANYWAYS.. since having this little light bulb moment I've also realized that I have a hard time GENUINELY feeling happy when I smoke. Sounds easy enough to be like ""okay then why keep smoking?"" I guess the answer is I don't really know. I guess the habit is easy to fall into??

I am 23 and at 18 I started smoking weed.
At the time, I was convinced I had discovered the best thing in the world.

Marijuana relaxed me like no other thing and every time I was stoned, I got a huge amount of inspiration.
Because of this, I started writing a blog at the time.

That’s when my smoking became a routine and I associated it with my creativity.
I always smoked before I wrote anything.
In fact, my blog was liked by many because I wrote about my life experiences and lessons.

I wrote over 55 blogs, got over 30,000 readers and that gave me the confidence to get down to writing the first book.
The  book is talking about how pointless it is to complain and talk about things you have no control over.

I even wrote the book completly stoned and I was so proud of it that I even wanted to write it at the end of the book, thank god I didn’t.
The book became a bestseller and I was convinced that marijuana help me with writing and inspiration.

At 21, I moved on my own and soon started living with a girlfriend. I also introduced her to smoking weed with me.
We smoked every night together, for a year, until one day she told me that if that was all we were going to do in life?
Whatever we do, wherever we go, will we always get high?

And then she said she doesn’t go for it anymore and won’t smoke anymore.
I still smoked alone for a while, but I felt bad and stupid.

To shorten the story a bit, in the meantime I quit smoking myself, for about a month, then soon my girlfriend and I ended up and that’s when I became seriously addicted to weed.

I smoked from morning to night, 20+ joints.
And so it’s been a year since, you know how fast time passes if you’re stoned all the time.

And the more honest I was with myself, the more I realized that weed no longer brings me inspiration, creativity, and good things into my life, but quite the opposite.

It started to bring me procrastination, I wrote less and less, I hung out with others less and less, I started to isolate myself from everyone.

Most of the time, I avoided contact with people because I felt uncomfortable.
And when I quit my job a month ago, I got a huge amount of free time and you know how I used it.

This led me to start asking myself ""Seriously? You wrote a book that helped thousands and you can't help yourself, you run away from yourself, you avoid responsibility, you don't face problems""

So my brothers, the greatest thing we can do for ourselves is to be brutally honest with ourselves.
Let’s ask ourselves, are we happy with our lives, will we be proud of ourselves in 10 years, if we continue like this, will we leave anything behind, will we contribute anything to this world if we run away from ourselves every day?

The weed was an escape for me.
And I chose escape whenever I had to face problems and responsibilities.
I used to have a huge circle of people who loved hanging out with me. Because I was positive, inspiring and enjoyed talking to people.

I receive a message from the readers of my book almost every day, and because I've been feeling so bad about myself lately, I often don't even know what to reply because I'm no longer feeling like the man who wrote this book.

So I tell you honestly from the heart, is it worth it that one plant has such a negative impact on your life?

It’s now been a week since I’ve been clean, I’m training every day, I’ve started eating healthier, i'm more motivated than ever, I’m preparing a new board game about relationships and if I want it to help other, I first need to help my self.

Somehow I felt like I wanted to share this story of mine with you in the hopes of making someone think and motivating them to quit smoking or remain clean.

I'm looking forward to that and I thought I might put aside money I spent on weed to reward myself with a cool experience after 3 months clean (an helicopter ride).     

Those who hit this mark, did you feel this change on your reward system or not really ?

In the early years of my smoking life, i used to talk weed up like it was the supplement of the century. Hungry, happy, sleepy, what else could you want right? I would rave and convince my friends on how this was better than doing any other drugs, and why it does no harm. Little did i know, that while i was raving about weed and its properties, i was subconsciously using it to supress emotions, or feelings, or to just simply fall asleep. After a few forced detoxes caused by job drug tests, i realized how much i needed it daily to function. This alarmed me, causing me to have more anxiety everytime i smoked. So here i am, day 2 about to begin. Already experiencing insomnia, anxiety,  irritability,  and already got into a stupid fight with the wife. I'm determined to get my mental clarity back so i can focus again! Learn again!! I want to live life without the rose colored glasses,  and I'm hoping that posing this here will hold me accountable.

This is first time for me showing something and telling about something. I belive, there is someone who will understand me.

I'm 28 years old man. I'm a alcaholic. From 14-21 year I had very serious alcahol addiction. There was a times, when I was able to drink month without stops, homemade vodka with my alcahol friends. Drugs, of corse, but it wasn't the most important. Best friend was a alcahol, with who I can run away from anyone,- family, responsibility, work or school, problems.

I stopt to drink at all when I was 21. From that time, I'm smoking. 
I changed a country when I was 22. (Baltic country to Finland) 
Married in 25, divorced in 26. (married for less than 2 years) 
Tried to understand God's wish in a church for some time. 
Changed about 10 living places and 5 cities. 
Traveled every year to some country together with family (mom, dad, me, sister) 
Listened about 50 audiobooks about psihology, self motivation, life... 
Sport drones, BMW. 
Morning trainings, meditation.
SEO, programming. 

Everything what I'm doing in my life I'm doing with passion. If I'm drinking then I'm drinking so hard, that everyone already things that I will die soon. 
If I work, I work so hard that body can't handle the speed how I'm managing things.

If I want something, I'm can work sooo hard, but when I get it I just stop to do what I was doing. I have that thing what get me so inspired and I don't need anything more... 

First 2 years smoking for me was chilling, audiobooks, nice friends and people's, car fixing, music, everything. 
I really believed, that it's lifestyle, that it's me. Cool smoker.
Then 4 years it was 1-5g per day smoking where I understand that I'm doing wrong thing. 3g cost 50€, so it's expensive, very. Big part of my salary always goes nowhere, but I don't care. Money is only money, cues I'm addicted and lost. 

I was trying to quit a lot of times. Mostly every night I will go to sleep with bad mood because I have been smoking last 6 hours. 

One day I found out that that it's possible to buy everything what you need to grow a weed, even its not legal to grow in this country. I spend 4 months reading, watching, collecting money and... As I said, if I'm doing something I'm doing with passion. I have 2 big tents with 5 big LED lamps, lot of pipes, fans, many nutrients, 17 plants. 

I don't know what kinda problems I can get, don't know anyone with who to talk about this. I'm scared some moments, but then I'm trying to smoke and not to think about that. 
It's like: ""you can take me to jail, I don't care. If I am living in world where addiction is a crime, I'm a top criminal. Fuck it"". 
I'm so afraid to do bad to someone that I'm doin bad only to myself. 
I'm trying to sort waste, I'm opening doors for old people's and woman's with children's, I'm never throwing anything on the ground, I will never tell any bad word in public, I will respect every person and hees needs in this world. I am driving with car daily last 6 years. I didn't had any accident and had 1 bill for speed (radar).
I speak in 4 languages, so always helping to people's around me to understand each other. 
I'm not a bad guy. ""Guten Morgen"" 

I can smash growing equipment, throw out plants and weed I have, but... Does it changes the way I'm thinging? I will find other way to make myself pain in other way. Stuck. 

3 months ago I had small accident with my hand at work, so can't work anymore. Out of money. Out of everything. Still waiting some decision from social help, but I guess it takes much more time as I thought. The worst thing is that I don't care. Don't have nothing and don't need nothing. There is comming lot of bills witch I can't pay anymore. One of them is Gym, where I made mambership 5 months ago and that was the last time when I was there. Had a nice plan to quit smoking and start gym. This was my fifth time I think. 

I'm still smiling and same time crying, only nobody sees it and won't.

26F here and one week sober today after smoking daily (mainly; quit for about 30 days beginning of 2020 then fell back into old habits) for about 8 years now. 
Funny thing is when I first tried weed I HATED it. Didn’t try it again until I went to college in Colorado and became a huge user. 
Told myself it helped my anxiety but really it just made me fat (damn you munchies!) and eventually more anxious (the 30 days i quit this year was cause i started having panic attacks and thinking my heart was bad and religiously watching my heart rate on my Fitbit and even went to get an EKG done one day then found what types of weed made me less anxious and started again)
Really want to quit for good. Lost 20 lbs this year and have about another 30 lbs to go. Find it impossible when smoking to eat healthy. Never really had any other bad effects like it affecting my school or work so never really cared to quit. Heck I mean I got a Chemical Engineering degree in college while smoking almost 1g of dabs every few days. I don’t even know why I enjoyed it and did it daily to begin with honestly. My tolerance got so high I never really felt “high” at all the last couple years but continued to do it. I just know quitting will have major benefits on my health mentally and physically. Physically it will help me reach a healthy weight and mentally I hope to lower my panic attacks/anxiety and get my memory back. Used to have the best memory of anyone I knew and now I can barely remember what I ate for dinner yesterday. 
Anyway, looking forward to coming here for support in those times I feel week. Anytime I’m bored or anxious I think “man really wish I had some weed right now, that would help!” and want to break that cycle cause I know it’s not true that it would help. I know I can do it.

I’ve been lurking here for a few months, but I’m making efforts to make this time the last so I thought it could be helpful to post. The only way I can talk about my addiction with my friends is through jokes and I don’t want to do that anymore so I’m glad to be candid for once.

I’m 20 years old and I’ve been a daily marijuana user for 5 years now. I’ve been *saying* I want to quit for 4 years now, since the first day I got high. I actually think I stopped really enjoying getting high and started romanticizing the feeling around then too. I almost made two weeks this summer, but I ended up telling myself that I can be a responsible recreational user like I see others do. I can’t. I get sucked in harder than every after each failed sobriety attempt. And I’m ready to quit for LIFE. 

What’s different about this time is that I asked for help. I told my parents how hard I was struggling and they quickly helped me move back home so they can hold me accountable. My family is incredibly supportive and I’m so blessed for it. I wish I could extend that support to everyone here who doesn’t have that. My 21st birthday is in a week, and they’ve agreed to spend the day watching musicals with me and not drinking. (Drinking is a trigger for me to smoke) 

I have huge goals and aspirations and right now I see my life going one of two ways; I kick this for good, I make up for 5 seemingly wasted years of my life and become who I want to be, or I spend the rest of my life quitting and relapsing. In the latter, I only see myself sleeping in, missing work, letting people down, and hating myself. Same as now. 

Today I feel optimistic. I don’t want to smoke. But I’m scared to experience inevitable urges and I’m glad for my support at home as well as the support I hope I can find in this community. My questions for you all: did you ever have to reach out to friends/family to hold you accountable for your smoking? Did it result in any conflict? Also, do you *really* notice a difference win yourself after the drug leaves your body, after around 6 weeks or so? I imagine it’s a slow change. But in your experience, what changes did you truly notice?

After taking a look at myself over my life (I'm 25) I've began to see patterns in my behavior that, if I'm completely honest, scare the crap out of me.

Its not the weed, its me.  

I was abusing liquor from the age 17 until I was 22. When I started to lose friends I quit drinking, though it was quickly replaced by weed. But even before all of that, my whole childhood I abused food, i was obese from a very young age, then when I was 14 I reached my peak at 330 pounds due to gorging every day.

See my mother back in the 90s, had breast cancer, she survived thank God. I love her, but the chemotherapy she went through has knocked off her brain chemistry, ever since she has showed massive signs of bipolar disorder/ moderate narcissistic tendencys. I realized that I've had to walk on eggshells my whole life, I become dependent on things I find comfort in. Listening to the screaming everyday, having anger.. more like rage.. directed at you every day, its more than I can handle. She refuses to seek help as she think all tharapists are quacks, and that anyone who can't take care of themselves is pathetic. Apparently its more healthy to make everyone around you miserable😑.
 My self esteem is none existent, I can't manage relationships, I can't handle any type of stress without breaking down. How many grown 25 year old, 6'4"" men break out crying when they see a slightly negative email? Or crying in any confrontation. Hell it takes me days to convince myself to check my voice-mail due to how weak my shoulders are.

My decisions are mine, I'm not trying to place blame, just trying to add context to myself about how i got here.
I'm just ashamed at how I've developed. 
All I know is, this is day 5, and I'm going to keep going, no parent, drug, or even myself is getting in the way this time.

I’m setting my intention today to not smoke or take any edibles.  I just had laparoscopic surgery and was diagnosed with endometriosis, so I had a lot of pain this week.  After day 1, I used weed to manage instead of the hydrocodone but it’s a slippery slope.  I’d love some tips on how you are handling staying sober while quarantined.

I have been waking and baking and ended the day on Thanksgiving and yesterday with a few drinks.  I didn’t get drunk or anything but I’m aware enough to know this is not healthy.

I’m concerned with this becoming a real problem ... I am a very high functioning addict and I have really severe chronic pain - migraines & endo are pretty awful, so I always struggle with holistic vs heavy duty pharmaceuticals.  I take a lot of both.

It’s hard to be isolated in recovery before and after surgery too ... I’m also looking at a long painful road w the endo and very likely more surgeries.  It’s been a rough week emotionally because I just don’t know that I’ll ever get better.

I’ve gone through periods like this in the past and came out on the other side very well ... I actually tend to be surprised at how not bad at all it is when I quit.  I’ve gone months, years without smoking - once I get it out of my system and if I’m not around it, I’m fine.  But it’s the long hours at home, being isolated, holidays, lots of pain, the mental struggle I’m going though because of the diagnosis ... these are all triggering me to WANT to smoke all day every day.  Like purposely escaping this mini-hell I’m going through 

The pain gives me the excuse, the self-pity does too .... i must feel I deserve to go into a fog of pills and weed because this is just HARD

I can always make it for a good part of the day but I always crack ... typically I get through a detox by keeping busy and active — sitting home the days get long & all & being alone at home is a major trigger for me - I’ve got some neglect issues from growing up.

I just wanted to say something to all of the new people and anyone who is struggling with the mentality of ""I've quit like, 100 times now"".

When I quit the first time, it lasted 5 days. But that was 5 days of being sober for the first time in almost 4 years. Then I ""relapsed"" of course, and ""tried to quit"" maybe another 20-30 times before something finally stuck.

I was ""sober"" again for 6 months (least I wasn't smoking weed) before I smoked again. Then 2 months. Then 1 month. Then 1 week. Then daily.

Then I quit again. 9 Months. 2 months. 1 month. Daily.

Then I quit again. And again. And again. 7 days completely sober right now.

This post isn't to tell you what you will learn and accomplish by staying completely sober for #523 days. This post is to tell you that by struggling for my sobriety for more than a year, not only have I won more often than I have lost, but that **I am getting better**.

The first time I quit, it was a nightmare. But every time I learned tools about how to get sober. I learned lessons about the addiction. I learned more about what it was doing to my mind. And most importantly, I learned more about how to get sober.

This post isn't to say that ""moderation is okay"", for a lot of people, including myself, it's just not. But it IS okay to fail. Relapsing isn't even failing in my eyes anymore. By struggling and failing and struggling and failing and struggling and failing, I am getting better, not only at being sober, but at becoming a better person.

So if your day #1 is unbearable, if you're depressed because you've relapsed for the 100th time, I just wanted to tell you that it's okay. ""Failure"" is part of the path to recovery. I know very few people who were completely successful the first time. Focus on learning and improving, you will eventually be successful.

Just, never stop getting back up and fighting to be sober. Don't stay down and you can try again. Better.

This led to literally smoking 24/7 (not even exaggerating), only time I wasn’t stoned was when I was sleeping. Became a shell of a human. Too high to process emotions, too high to take action, too high to do my class work, too high to lead a regular social life, too high to check on family members who were also struggling with mental health issues, too high to ask for help, too high to budget my money.

This is obviously a combination of a multitude of things, mental health, history of abuse of marijuana and other substances to numb emotions, all combined with the fact that I’ve been cooped up in an apartment because classes are online, gyms are closed. But it all led to the familiar downward spiral.

Just wanted to gain some additional perspective of what I am currently experiencing. Like many of us here, I have always had an internal battle with weed. It worked so well for me in almost every situation that it was THE solution to my problems. I've tried taking breaks and ""quitting"" but I realized I wasn't doing it purely for myself.. for the betterment of myself.

This was the obvious problem I had and was in denial for a long time.. but recently about a month ago my partner of 3 years broke up with me.. because I would continually lie and hide the fact that I was smoking by myself some nights. What shocks me is that I am an honest person and have been transparent to my partner about everything, except for weed.

A blessing in disguise, this break up made me realize I had an addiction, and the reason why I had to hide it from my partner was because I hid it from myself. I'm over a month sober, and although I do think about weed often, I always think back to why I've quit in the first place. I don't necessarily get a craving anymore and I just feel guilt, anger, and sadness that I let myself slip like this and lose the person I love so so much. Please let me know if anyone has had similar experiences as myself. And as a side note I'm continuously working on myself to becoming the best version of myself, and giving the time and space my partner needs at the moment from feeling the constant betrayal and emotional pain that she had to endure because of my selfishness and addiction that I hid from myself for so long.",3,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7607315182685852}"

I can feel my anxiety and panic fill my chest, but I will press on because I NEED HELP. 

I’m currently 2 months sober from alcohol and 3 days sober from marijuana. I’ve been smoking everyday for at least 3 years. I started smoking 10 years ago. My 2 roommates are also trauma victims with untreated, undiagnosed, not in therapy and not professionally medicated PTSD/BPD/and symptoms. You can’t live through these types of extended violent trauma events and not have PTSD. One roommate depends on alcohol, the other depends on weed. We all have access to any illegal drug we want from long years in the food service industry (cocaine and hallucinogens are common and recreational in our friend group). I love them very much. They have given me the most understanding support. We have all experienced assault within our home at some point in our lives. It’s a terrible trauma bond, but we all feel unsafe alone at home. So we support each other through those times. They are also trying to be better in their lives, but I am the only one seeking therapy for my trauma. 

4 days ago I left that house and that state and I’m visiting my childhood home for several months. I went from a legal to an illegal state, so I figured now would be a good time to try to get 100% sober. 

I haven’t slept more than 3-4 hours in a 24 hour period since I stopped smoking. How long does this last for? The exhaustion is getting really extreme. I can’t sleep because my flashbacks and nightmares are SO intense and vivid. I tried 3mg of melatonin with absolutely no effect. I tried 5mg of melatonin and had the worst, longest, most vivid nightmare yet. Sometimes I wake up and I’m not breathing. Or even just sitting and watching tv and I realize I’m panicking because I’m not breathing. 

I love yoga and meditation but in my current state, my 8+ years of ‘focus on your breathing’ just evaporated. Every time I close my eyes now  I see the face of my perpetrator and I relive the experience.

Since that, no weed, no edibles.

Like, if nothing else, maybe just, y'know, quit and like once a year around my birthday for a week I'll smoke yknow? yeah, that's a plan.

That was a *great* plan when my birthday was almost a year away

And the closer I get the more I want to smoke, I'm so close to Christmas and that magical in-between time of years and my birthday is only a few days before and why not just go get some now? get an early start?

The obsession is back.  Sneaking in at moments of stress saying ""why not...?"" and ""just go for it..""

Managing to quit didn't make me capable of moderating.  I've received no certificates in the mail saying ""congratulations on your abstinence, as a reward you've earned the right to use marijana again"". So why does my brain feel like it has.  Like I've been so good I've ""earned"" something.

My life is shit, feelsbadman.jpg, and I can definitely smoke again but I don't know if I can quit again.  quitting has never been easy and almost always driven by large external factors.  My life is demonstrably better than it was last January, waaaay better, so why can't I make the connection between ""not smoking"" = ""better life"".  Yeah my life is shit but it was waaaay shittier before.  

The whispers tell me about all the things I'd gain? What about all the shit I'd lose.  The whispers tell me I'm breaking a promise to myself. by *not* smoking.  What about all the promises I broke to myself *while* I was quitting.

So, what, maybe next year?  Like, I was triggered immensely when the air got chilly and the snow started to appear.  The seasons of the fucking planet are enough to trigger me.  It's *not* the fault of the seasons, It's any excuse my addict self can latch onto.

And I don't trust that I could pull myself out of it.. I don't know that I'd stop.  I have no evidence from my life to suggest I'd be capable of stopping.  Living a better life sucks some times.

2020-11-27 09:15:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k21u2x/new_relationship_with_weed/,New relationship with weed,"Hey guys!

Im a 26 year old guy and my life can be described with one word: catastrophe. Really. Every aspect of my life went to absolute shit in the course of the last 4 years. I had an accident and since then have to live with various, chronic health issues. Im unemployed and have a huge gap in my CV. I have no girlfriend and never had one ( at least im not a virgin anymore but it was more luck than anything else ). I only have 2 friends left and every other one turned out to be no friend at all... Well and in 2 cases i was the asshole that was not a worthy friend, but i didnt see it until it was too late.

I could go on and on. Theres not a single aspect of my life that im successfull in or thats even remotely ok. I have a talent to fuck everything up, me and my life.

&#x200B;

Im not naive: I know that weed isnt the cause and that these are issues that are deep within and have to be adressed. BUT it definitely made it worse in my case, because i used it to flee my problems and to be ok with living shitty, essentially doing nothing about my problems. 

It used to do me good. I am depressed since im a teenager and as i think thats where my social anxiety started to, it just wasnt really apparent in a crippling way. In the beginning, i had a very good time with weed and it made me, my mind, ""free"" in a way and everything was fine, funny, cool... That carried on for some years.

Then weed became addictive and i started smoking way more than it was good for me, for several years.

&#x200B;

But now i made my way to a point where its not sustainable at all. I have way too many problems to sort out, get my life back on track ( if thats even possible ), and the negative effects of my weed addiction now vastly outnumber the positive ones, it made a complete U turn. 

Because now weed is just a source of heavy anxiety 90% of the time i smoke. Also i constantly indulge in my problems and feel like an idiot because im still not doing anything about it and rather smoke.

Its not like im unproductive, i make a lot of music when i smoke... But i realized i do everything to run away. Be it smoking or even music... It seems like i do everything just to run away from my problems and fuck my life up more and more. Uncosciously sabotaging myself is definitely a big problem for me.

Weed also seems to fuck heavily with my brain nowadays, as if its making me crazy. Its really weird and i never felt that before.

&#x200B;

I think everything is just adding up now and reaching its sad pinnacle. It really cant get much worse from here, only if my health detoriates even more or die. But aside from that my life cant get  much worse, although i learned it can always get siginificantly worse, even if you think youre already at rock bottom. Problem is rock bottom goes always deeper, theres no limit to how shitty it can get.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yeah and thats it. Last night i smoked my last J and although i dont want it to be the last one in my life, i know i have to get completely clean and stay away from it for a loooooong time. And then maybe i will start to smoke once in a while on a special occassion, if i feel like its a good idea and doesnt spiral me back into the shit and addicition. 

But as things are right now, the best thing i can do is quit weed and get some fucking help... Because i thought i can sort my problems out on my own, but im way more fucked up than i ever thought. If i dont get my life back on track theres literally no sense in living at all and i might as well end it right here.

&#x200B;

So thats it. I just post this to hold myself accountable and remind me that theres no way i can live on like that.

We were profoundly in love like for 2 years and then it just fell appart, but instead of breaking up for good, we still were in a relationship for 5 years more, 5 years when we would just hook up, have sex, fight again, we both knew it was dead, but we were together just for the sake of habit. It's funny that looking in foresight I think I didn't love her for the last 4 years, but I only managed to realize it few months before breaking up for good.

Weed is the same, I used to absolutely love it around 2011 to 2013, but then the problems started (with both weed and my ex), I started smoking 24/7, I wouldn't enjoy life without both of them. Then when I broke up with my ex (first of a hundred times) I just couldn't handle my life without weed. Fast forward to 2015 I was absolutely depressed and tried to stop smoking, just to realize I wasn't able to. Since then I've tried to stop like a hundred times, but always came back for the sake of habit and every time I came back I thought ""this is just so nice, why did I wanted to stop?"" Just like with my ex 

So that was my life until 2020 when I managed to stop from February to May when I smoked for 2 weeks and leave it again until July, the I smoked few times until October and thought ""I can handle this"" and now I'm stoner again.

This week I broke up with my girlfriend (a different one)and I instantly realized that most of the relationship issues where exacerbated by my weed consumption. I became irritable, everything she said was a pain in the ass to me so I ""escaped"" from her last weekend and smoked a lot of weed. Tuesday we broke up, and I decided I would break up with weed as well, so I gave all my stash to a friend and dolled big time for the last time in my life.

Being sober for the longest time since 2011, this year showed me that I can reach my full potential without weed. And this 2 months smoking showed me how bad is weed to me, it affects me in ways I couldn't imagine, can't handle my feelings, my energy it's as t floor level, my brain is sluggish and my lung capacity is clearly reduced. For that and more, today is day 2 in what I hope is my longest sober streak, may be a few years, or even all my life, what I know today is I don't love weed and haven't done it for long time.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9704079627990723}"

My reason for quitting is that I’m a singer and the phlegm build up really effects my ability to sing consistently and I get a sore throat often.

I’d noticed over the past few months my sore throats have been getting a lot worse, after checking my throat in the mirror I noticed a lot of small red lumps at the very back of my throat,behind the dangling thing and tonsils (which obviously scared the living shit out of me!) went to see my GP and she stated it was cobblestone throat due to acid reflux or all the extra phlegm I was producing from smoking weed and it will clear up on it own.

I’ve also noticed I’m coughing up a lot more brown tar than when I was smoking. Which I’m assuming is a good sign and that my lungs are clearing out all the shit from years of smoking.

I just wondering if anyone had encountered cobblestone throat from smoking before and how long it took to clear up? And how long can I expect to be coughing up all the brown stuff?

However a week and a half later my pain and pressure in my head is almost gone however smoking now sends me into what I can only Describe as allergic reaction - dried airways heavy white mucus pooling in my throat and  constantly spitting or trying to shluck it, in an attempt to spit it out this is almost chronic for me. All of the above has made me want to stop smoking despite a heavy dependence and the fact that a lot of if not most the people I know smoke especially now during covid when no ones really doing anything (finished high school last year) I smoked a bong yesterday and it literally caused my cheek to swell up like I just been punched in the face - I realised this is something that’s happened almost regularly when I smoke I previously attributed  this swelling too sinusitis and post operation swelling asWell as a poor Tmj however weed irritates this to the point where is just unenjoyable i just sit there high af stressing about why this is happening or what could be causing it.

Any help or advice is welcomed and appreciated - I’m sick of feeling like this , could it be severe TMJ iv had braces and use a bite plate at night which doesn’t seem to do much but it does help from grinding my teeth which I very possibly to in my sleep as I am a generally anxious/tense individual ?

Marijuana helped destroy my mental health almost as soon as I started using it when it became legal in my state about 5 years ago. 

My life revolved around my vape pen. I didn’t go anywhere fun or exciting because I don’t drive high. It made me binge eat into oblivion almost every night. I needed it for literally everything I did but it only enhanced my experience for maybe 20 minutes before the bad thoughts always began, especially reliving cringe or not good moments from my past. The obscurity of the triggers were ridiculous. I would get paranoid about making huge mistakes at work and second guess all of my decisions. While I was high, I would wonder why I kept putting myself through this day after day but the first hint of being sober made me reach back for it without a second thought. My relationship with my spouse has suffered because of my use. 

I’ve been trying to cut back for probably 6 months with literally no effort. I kept telling myself I needed to finish my cartridge before I would quit to save the money. Today I threw it in the garbage only half used. Then I threw out the thanksgiving food scraps on top of it to resist the temptation of going back for it. And shamefully, I’ve thought about it more than once today. 

I’ve realized I’m not ever going to be a casual smoker. This is it. I’m really afraid but I’m ready. I quit nicotine about 2 months ago which seemed almost impossible and I did that so I guess it gave me the courage to quit this as well.

He told me that sometimes when smokers are going under they have a lung spasm and that they give medicine to stimulate the airways. He said he would have to do that in the event that I had this reaction, and I did. 

Maybe it's easy to forget how bad cannabis is for our lungs when we compare it to cigarettes. But what I learned yesterday is that its just as bad as smoking cigs. I was scared when he told me that...and it's all the incentive I need to quit completely despite my cravings. I just dont want to put myself at risk for any kind of health issue associated with a substance that offers me nothing but negative side effects anymore. 

Overcoming any type of addiction is so good for mental health and physical wellbeing. I know its difficult but all of you have worked so hard and I admire you for it. I downloaded the ""grounded"" app and put my first entry in today.

As above, I am a new member and this is my first ever post on Reddit. 

I have been smoking weed consistently for 18 years albeit not everyday but the majority of them.
If I have work then I do not smoke until the evening. If I have no plans, I will wake and bake. 
My justification being that I can function and be really productive when I am high. 

I completed my hair & beauty qualifications whilst high. I passed my driving test high. 
I completed a qualification in social care whilst high. 
I now have 2 children and have been in construction for 8 years. My company agreed to pay for me to go to open uni and gain a degree - I want this so bad and I will be the first person in my family to gain a degree. 
So far so good, I have studied and submitted 3 assignments in 8 months but it is getting too much.
I go to bed late after studying, cleaning and showering and get up early to go to work everyday - having 2 children with hobbies, my weekends are not dissimilar. 

I recognise that I smoke to cloud my feelings and I have not been able to cry for around 2 years.
My ex husband is a malicious narcissistic arsehole and despite using researched techniques to respond in an appropriate way the courts would appreciate, it does get to me sometimes. 

It doesn’t help me that I also used to smoke cigarettes and have been addicted to nicotine mints for 7/8 years so even though I don’t technically smoke cigarettes, I still intake nicotine from mints and how I roll my weed. 

When I don’t smoke or use mints, I feel either numb or irritable. I researched various methods to cope and one was to recognise and sit with the ill-feeling. 
I can’t sleep if I don’t smoke weed in the evening and more and more I’ve started to feel so groggy in the mornings.
I use weed as my wine because I don’t really drink much alcohol but if I don’t have weed then I’ll drink and smoke cigarettes.

I don’t want this to be my life anymore but whenever I have extended breaks from smoking, I always go back to it. 

I’m at a loss and can’t currently afford hypnotherapy, psychologists or similar.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9966412782669067}"
2020-11-26 09:43:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/k1gcw8/thankful_for_being_1_year_clean/,Thankful for being 1 year clean,"I don't remember the exact date but I know it was near Thanksgiving last year that I gave up marijuana after 15+ years of smoking straight. Longer if you count the years before I gave it up for a few years back in my 20s because of probation. It was this subreddit that convinced me not only to give it up and move on but that I was addicted and that addiction was ruining my life. Looking back now I realized my whole life has been my wheels spinning in the mud going nowhere. I quit smoking cigarettes in March of last year. I joined r/quitsmoking for support and that lead me to this community. At first I wasn't ready to quit marijuana. Had no thoughts on doing it but for some reason I joined just to see what would come up on my feed from it. The more I read your stories the more I began to understand.

The biggest one that did it for me was from someone saying they had to smoke before doing any activity. Before going anywhere. That was me. The person went on to say that after smoking 10,000 times it was all the same. They weren't actually experiencing anything new. I looked at myself and realized it was true about me too. That that is what I was doing. The more I looked at that the more I realized that my days off were all the same. I got up, smoked a bowl or two, got high and after a cup of coffee I just needed to smoke more because the high was just turning into that blah feeling that many of us here almost certainly all know. Then the rest of the day was wasted chasing after that feeling I had for at best 30 minutes that morning. I smoked the rest of what I had and then vowed to buy no more.

I stuck to that.

And then that is when the magic started happening. I usually take public transportation to work and I noticed on my rides I was actually awake and aware instead of just being in my marijuana induced stupor. Not long after it turned into when I was at work I wasn't just going through motions anymore, I was actually focused on work. In less than 6 months I got a promotion and a few months ago I got a semi-promotion. It's still the same position but I am in charge of the work coming in from a smaller company we acquired.

Looking back now, I can see how different I am now than then. I actually am experiencing life. Instead of just eating the same old cheeseburgers I have a new taste for food and enjoy cooking better things. I'm eating vegetables I would never have even considered eating before, like radishes, because I am finding that life and all it offers as my high. Before I used to think that people that said ""I get high on life"" sounded silly but now I know exactly what they mean.

Looking back now, I can truly say that leaving is the second best decision I have ever made in my life. Quitting tobacco still remains number one but leaving is a very close second. Thank you all of you leavers for being here so I could leave as well.

I hope you all are having a very wonderful Thanksgiving day.",56,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9893737435340881}"

I used to smoke before everything: going out eat, park, work, gatherings, movies. I would roll blunts and I would grab one and have it with me in a small container. I would smoke when j was walking the dog and take a few hits and try to be discreet and than put it out. I would smell like weed so always have mints with me and brush my teeth. I would spend $50-75 a week religiously and would also stop at 7/11 or Wawa everyday yo get swisher or white owls and you know when I was high, I thought man I need to stop, but when I was sober, I’d say man I need to smoke. I would get irritable if I didn’t smoke or when I ran out I would have to hit up my dealer to grab some. Now, I don’t worry about any of that.

I started smoking when I was 15 and I don’t think I’ve ever gone a month without getting high since then. I’m 22 now. It never felt like a problem or addiction and I never saw it that way, but a couple weeks ago while I was slightly hungover I just.. lost all interest in weed. 
Some friends gave me dabs and a cart for free (which is something I used to jump for joy over) and they’re just collecting dust in my closet. I forget they’re there. The idea of being stoned is so off putting, when I imagine being high it just gives me a feeling of being out of control (mostly in terms of eating) and a feeling of being mentally watered down. I don’t think this is a negative thing, I actually see it as the opposite but I’m just trying to understand.. wtf happened? Getting baked has been one of my favorite things to do for years and just suddenly the idea disgusts me?

I have struggled to deal with life for the past 120 days. I quit, due to a barrage of symptoms, leading to 3 ER visits. I genuinely didn’t think it was the weed, rather I quit to rule that out as a factor and that I was now under increased threat to employment ramifications. Shortly after getting a bag of “Kief” off the dark web, I broke down. I felt like my sympathetic nervous system was on overdrive for a month straight. I thought I might have had toxic acetylcholine overdose due to pesticide in whatever I got online was.

After quitting and even before I went through intense withdrawal: sweats night and day, headache in the temples and what felt like migraines after. Tremors and feeling like acid was running through my veins. I couldn’t sleep and then I couldn’t sleep enough, 1-12 hours a day.

I work in a specialized field, with strict guidelines. But bc I’m a people person and smart, I’ve been able to smoke my entire career. This destroyed my ability to work. Raise my family. Function.

Something told me to quit after the second ER visit. Lucky for me I did. I got requested to pee in a cup about a month later. I passed.

Unlucky for me, I felt just as bad as I did the month before. 

Symptoms after 45 days: 

Nerves constantly aching after any moderate use - specifically calfs/lower leg and arms.

Loose shit every morning.

Feeling like I couldn’t focus

Red in the middle of my eyes 

Panic attacks

Massive health anxiety



 
All of that continued until I started drinking around  60-70 days. Drinking seemed to help a lot in the moment. At night all my nerve pain would go away and I would even be able to poop normal. But the mornings slowly got worse and worse. Until I couldnt wait for a shot of whisky at 5pm. I quit drinking once that happened.

I’ve saw my doctor and an endocrinologist repeatedly. They have done multiple 24hr urine and blood tests. I’m healthy as can be. 

It’s now 125 days. I still have mild nerve pain in my legs daily. I have headaches now that have started since I quit drinking 3 weeks ago. Eyes are still a bit red. I think it’s mostly histamine/inflammation.

To anyone out there who reads this site, it does get better. But it’s slow as shit. I regress often. There is no relief in weed. I smoked it all. Vape/butter/dabs as long as spaghetti.... I broke something in my brain. I’m sure it’ll get better. But I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.

Once I sat down for dinner and a TV show (my boyfriend and I are currently watching The Vow on HBO) I was distracted, and even after dinner the craving seemed to have passed.

Something to think about. I told myself I was using weed to manage various medical symptoms, including the eating disorder, a mood disorder (PMDD), plus period cramps. It was partially true. But I also just loved being stoned. My mother once asked me why I smoke. I explained life is like a donut; its ok on its own, but wouldn't icing make it even more exciting and delicious?

No part of me actually wants to do this. I'm just a big baby who wants food and a warm bed and to sleep my life away. 

But I'm getting old now and if I keep sleeping my life will be gone. I just did a timeline of myself, and I wasn't too bad until 26. Then I started a business. At 29 I had my first kid and I was just stuck. I don't know why but I told myself I was stuck now and just concentrated on making money. I was unhappy, so I drank constantly and smoked weed when I could. 

By 34 I was so fucked up. I think it was obvious to anyone who saw me drink that I had a problem. 

I realise now it was all anxiety from my childhood. That's when I found that if I was uncomfortable, I could always modify my feelings with drugs and deal with it wasted. And I got into the habit of being wasted all the time. Because I was always a bit anxious. But eventually the amounts of the drugs that I'm using just become unworkable. 

Anyway so 36 I had my last drink. Thank fucking god. I was going to die honestly. It was just getting worse. But now I feel weed is doing the same thing. I just don't want to be stoned anymore. But if I have weed, I'm always stoned. So I have to just not have weed. At all. I can't be around it. If I possess it, I just get stoned and watch movies.

I know to most this probably doesn't seem that major, especially considering that I've only got 4 days up however, this is fucking huge for me! I've never been a daily smoker (every 2-3 days), but I think this has been the reason I have been able to justify it for so long. I smoked all through high-school and well into university, now at 28 years old I've only realized that this substance is **no longer serving me**.

The reason I know the grass is greener so to speak, is because I clocked four months of complete sobriety when I was in my early twenties. Pretty uncommon I know. I'll explain why...

I worked in cafes through school and I always hated regular customers. I've always been a bit of a cynical prick and after reading several posts on this thread I noticed that it isn't uncommon to be angry at the world. Anyway this guy use to come in and sit a table by himself on his laptop for hours, have one cup of coffee and then leave. Didn't have a problem with the guy, it was the entitled customers that I resented.

Anyway I was wondering around the city one day after class and I saw him... Needless to say I pretended not to notice him. He approached me stuck out his hand and introduced himself. We had a chat and ended up catching the train home together. At that point in my life it was typical to boast about the bender I had the previous weekend but this time something weird happened... He didn't respond like most of the people I knew commonly did. He nodded his head and was clearly unfazed.

Jump to around three weeks later and I invited him around to watch the footy with a few mates. He arrived 3 hours before I was expecting anyone. He explained to me that he met with this group every Friday afternoon to talk about drug/ alcohol use. He said he was driving past and thought he would extend the invite. At that point I knew it was either NA or AA but I was like fuck it, this could be interesting. As you would expect a lot of it revolved around personal horror stories or hitting rock bottom but beyond that there was something that resonated with me.

I just wanted to say that I'm not pushing these programs on anyone, I went to a handful of meetings but ultimately it wasn't for me. My intention here is to break the stigma around it as I do believe that there are some elements that may resonate with some of you. First of all, how is marijuana serving you? I recently asked myself that and I realized that it was only having a negative impact on my life. Don't get me wrong I love the 'herb' but right now under current circumstances I know for a fact that I am not gaining anything from it. The reason I am mentioning any of this is because I was able to justify my bud use for such a long time and I didn't even consider that there was a life outside of drug use and drinking but there is. Sometimes we have to go from one extreme to the other to break the habit of compulsive use. I soon discovered that he was a full-blown marijuana addict, in and out of rehab because he couldn't control his addiction.

I’m currently at day 6 of my quitting journey - I decided to make the leap mostly because of the financial burden (I could afford the monthly payment on a Lexus with the money I spend on weed for Christ’s sake 😂) and just generally coming to the conclusion that this is no longer a “recreational activity” for me but rather a full blown addiction. 

After 6 days, I can feel the intense cravings and tweaky thoughts finally beginning to subside a bit... but the boredom remains unbearable. 

I would consider myself to be a “high functioning” addict (even though there is no such thing.... you’re still just an addict). I have a successful job in finance where I’ve been able to excel very quickly. I have lots of friends and great relationships. I’m living out the dream I’ve always wanted in NYC. Life is good for me - and I am immensely grateful for the situation I am in. 

Yet I am still so god damn BORED - and quitting has reaffirmed that. To me, I think this has always been weed’s main purpose - cover up the boredom and make myself feel okay with the stagnation of day-to-day life. Now that my crutch is gone, I’ve realized that I want more. And I’m realizing that I’m never going to get it if I don’t stay off this god damn drug. Whether it’s my fitness, career, love life, or friendships - they’ve always been just good enough for me to justify my use. 

But truly committing to quitting has opened my eyes that it can all be so much more. If I was able to attain the level of success I’ve had all while managing an addiction on the back burner of my brain, what will I be able to do without that constant tether? 

I am so excited to get through these initial withdrawals (which fucking SUCK) and eventually come out the other end hungrier than I’ve ever been. Going through these realizations will lead to me finding my passion - there is no doubt in my mind. 

Weed is great in moderation, but unfortunately some of us don’t have the genetic disposition to maintain that moderation. Please, please don’t let chasing a daily high keep you from reaching your true potential like I did for 7 years. I will not go back.

I won’t lie and say this as been easy. In the course of life I have quit cigarettes, painkillers, booze (almost a year at this point), and now finally weed. My brother asked me if coffee is next. Since quitting booze I’ve lost 50 pounds and have never in my life any felt better than I do now.

The first few days my anxiety was through the roof. I’ve been smoking pot for 30 years, starting in the early ’90’s. In the last few days I have been a shithead at times. I’ve snapped at my kid and wife, have been a selfish ass, and all around jerk. I have a supportive wife and she has been great while I haven’t. She is proud of me.

There have been a few times where I have just needed to make it through the moment, much less worrying about making it through the day. By day 7 my anxiety started to ease up a bit, where I have moments of anxiety instead of hours. I’ve had some emotional moments where I have looked back at my life and asked WTF. I know we all probably tend to do this, but I can’t help but to think it is useless to do so and unhealthy at best. The present and future is what we have now.

Yesterday I broken down and cried in my car while driving. I’d like to say I’m not sure why, but I do. I have finally come to the conclusion I am an addict. It doesn‘t matter what the substance whether it be booze, food, tobacco, weed, pills, particular hobbies, scrolling news sites, biting my nails, buying shit on eBay, you name it. I go all in. I’ve lived a life of selfishness. I have ignored my wife, my kid, my family, and my friends. I’m so blessed people that have stuck with me. I owe them everything. I realize I can’t turn all this around overnight. I have to work on this each day, to start living for others instead of myself. 

Instead of being sad at the time lost sitting around getting drunk and high, I am looking towards the future. Reading these stories and experiences from this community has been very helpful. Thank you all for that. I know some of you on day one might read this and hopefully something will ring true with you as well. I am a 50 year old professional that has been very lucky to have stayed out of trouble, kept a family, and functioned reasonably well. A couple of things I read that hit home with me were:

“I found myself drinking more and more and enjoying it less and less.”

”I smoked myself sober.”

I’m not sure who gets the credit for these two quotes, but it sums up my situation pretty well.

If you need some encouragement, message me. If you are here reading these post, all I can say is that you are taking the right path or may already be much further along than I am. It gets better, everyone is different and not everyone has a difficult time as some of the stories you may read. Embrace the suck because the sooner you do, the sooner you will put it behind you and feel better.

Music has always been a big part of my life and we all have our little life’s soundtracks. I have probably listened to one song about 100 times the last couple of days. I can’t listen to it without crying, but it feels so good: “Back in the High Life” performed by Warren Zevon. Not the yacht rock Steve Winwood version, but by someone like us/me, an addict. Zevon did it so well, he knew the life. Give it a listen, maybe it will inspire you as well.

We'll be back in the high life again  
All the doors I closed one time will open up again  
We'll be back in the high life again  
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in  
And we'll drink and dance with one hand free  
And have the world so easily and oh we'll be a sight to see  
Back in the high life again

Tried couple times and could go 4 months without it. Feels good but I also like to feel the high.

I really like the late night hype of smoking while vibing to a good song before sleep, but I don’t enjoy feeling hazy in the morning.

Neither do I enjoy spending around 100/200 per month. At the end of the year that money could be invested or spent on travel.

So my point is, I like the feeling I just think I need to cut it a bit in order to not spend so much money but at the same time I always have a little voice saying to quit.

I figured it might make finding a job easier though since I could pass a drug test so there would be more jobs I could apply to.

I hate to say it, but it feels like my life only improved because of weed. I used to not be able to sit still long enough to watch tv, play video games, read, write, or draw. I used to do all these things when I was younger, but as I grew older I was too anxious to sit still long enough to do any of those things. 

Now I feel like I’m back to where I was before. All I do all day is clean. I sweep, dust, and vacuum every day. I can’t sit through a 20 minute YouTube video. 

I keep checking to see if the doors are locked. When I check I tell myself “look, the door is locked, you are checking it right now and it’s locked, you don’t have to check anymore” but no matter how hard I do this a few minutes later my brain says “but what if you weren’t paying attention? What if a tiny earthquake that you didn’t feel shook the lock loose?” And I check and check and check. 

I try to wash my hands for only 20 seconds but my brain says I miscounted, I need to do it again and count very slowly to make sure. I count very slowly and then I think what if the CDC (or whoever) is wrong and I need to wash them for 30 seconds? What if I missed a place because I’m focusing too much on the counting? 

I wake up in the middle of the night and I can’t go back to bed until I’ve check the locks and washed my hands multiple times. My fucking knuckles are bleeding because I keep washing off the lotion I put on them. 

I am so paranoid/anxious sometimes it feels like I’m having a heart attack. I’m afraid everyone is dead or getting into a terrible accident. I text the people closest to me everyday and when they don’t reply immediately I have to force myself to do breathing exercises to keep from having a panic attack. 

I feel like I’m going fucking crazy. I thought I “grew out” of all of these terrible habits but maybe I was just high and didn’t worry about it? I’ve been unemployed for so long and I can’t get unemployment money anymore, so I’m going to have to be weed free for the foreseeable future.

Can anyone give advise on how to deal with the anxiety and paranoia? I don’t even feel like a person anymore, I’m just fueled by fear 24/7 and, not to sound melodramatic, but I kind of want to die? I’m not suicidal, far from it, but I’m having trouble even remembering what it was like not to be scared like this all the time. I’m sorry if this was long, I’m just really stressed (about nothing) and I’m going kind of insane about it.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989757537841797}"

Started working there in high school and I’ve been there for a couple years so I know everybody pretty well. i’m the youngest employee there(19), and almost all of my coworkers are over 35. we have a good camaraderie and they are my good work friends, we talk about a lot of personal things, know each others likes and dislikes, etc. If anybody has ever worked in the service industry, you know that unfortunately drug use is very normalized in restaurants. almost all of the front of house (where i work) and back of house employees smoke weed constantly, and a handful dabble in pills. I came into the job just smoking on the weekends and after a few months I was smoking constantly. Mainly just before work and as soon as I got home, and occasionally I would hit a coworker‘s dab pen in the bathroom. In february I had just stoped smoking for 2 weeks, after 2 years, and then they closed down due to covid leaving me out of work. to keep my rent and other bills paid I started doing Tele-marketing from my computer. It was stressful and a really shitty job, so I found myself texting some friends looking for a cart dealer. I found one and I started smoking on a dab pen again, but this time only taking one small hit each night (as opposed to 4-8 big hits each sesh which was normal previously). fast forward until 10 Days ago. I came into work as normal and at the end of the night my best work friend (41) and I were walking back to our cars in the satellite parking lot. He pulled out his dab pen and started chain-smoking it. As he was getting near his car he started talking about how he needed new brake pads, but he jokingly said he needed to weed more (although he said it as a joke I could tell that he was being serious). I laughed, and he offered me to hit his dab pen. I declined, and he grinned, pulling some xanax out of his pocket. “need some of these huh” I declined again, and told him to have a good night. on my way home I pulled into a convenience store to get my nightly soda and $3 lotto scratcher. I took my dab pen out of my backpack and threw it in the trash. Because I realized that if I kept up this habit, that’s what my life would probably look like in 20 years. And I owe myself a better life and a better outlook on life then somebody working at a restaurant, getting high before they drive home, in a car that needs brake pads which they can’t afford because they spend too much money on weed. not trying to put anybody down who works in a restaurant, I know how well suited the service industry can be for certain lifestyles, But I definitely want to go down a different track in life. I know that weed is only going to either entirely change that track, or make it way more difficult than it has to be. So 10 days ago I finally went off weed, and made a decision to myself to never, ever, relapse, to get my sleep schedule back on track (used to stay up until 4am), and stop thinking day to day, and making a real, sober, effort to better my life to not end up in that position in 20 years. just had to get that out of my system.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9957039952278137}"

Think of a suitcase. This suitcase is big, there's a lot of room for your problems and no matter where you go, you carry it with you. Each time you smoke to escape, you put a negative thought into that suitcase. While being high, the problem is out of your sight and out of your head. It's in the suitcase now. And there's plenty of room for more.

Now think about years of smoking and all stuff that you put into this suitcase. Think about the luggage you carry with you all day, every day. Some of those problems you carry with you will resolve automatically, as time goes by, so they will leave the suitcase on their own. But not all problems will do that. Over time, there will be many root problems you carry with you that will not leave the suitcase on their own. One day, your luggage will be so heavy, that carrying this suitcase around will be too exhausting or you simply run out of space. 

The only way to make it easier is to unpack this suitcase. Take the items out one by one, and most importantly, stop putting new ones into it.",39,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988512992858887}"

This summer me and my friends had a 3 month long bender we went through more than 150G weed, mostly me and my one friend but other friends on and off. after those 150gs were gone I haven't been smoking as much but I did smoke almost daily. I became very unsocial person, I'm very lazy even to go out it takes me very big effort unless it was going out for weed. I stopped enjoying things a while ago, nothing would bring me pleasure other than getting high. Movies didn't feel same, tv shows wouldn't drag me in as much. I became disinterested person. This is my 4th day and I think I am feeling better, I don't know yet though. For past couple days my face feels like I've been crying but I have not, maybe it is because I had flu last week I don't know. Anyone felt same ?   
And what changes do you see after quitting weed? I don't see anything just yet, other than I went out today and didn't smoke just hung out with people sober and I didn't say no when my friend offered to hang out.   
And quitting hasn't been hard even, I was fed up with smoking to be completely honest I want to live sober life for a while. Maybe it's not hard now and I will miss it after a while. I'm 21 as of now just for the context.   
I did other drugs past year from September to February, mostly molly every friday, which really fucked my head up but I haven't done molly for 10 months already.

Seems everyone is chilling with people they love and I'm here alone not allowing myself to hide from all of this emotional turmoil by skinning up. 

I've had easier times this year, sure. But the same shit was going on. I hid from it while pushing people away as they tried to help. All those people I was close to I pushed away so I could smoke without their judgement. Those are people I can't apologise to enough, these are mistakes I've made.

However, as most smokers do, I realized some time ago that this habit was having negative consequences for me, and for sometime I was just ignoring those, but then I started to research more about it and eventually found this sub, which helped, I must say.

As of now, I successfully stopped smoking by myself (I had my first panic attack last time I smoked alone), but once a week when I'm with my university friends, I will smoke with them (This is because once a week I have to visit my uni city for a class that I still didn't finish, thanks to this lifestyle of course)

This is problematic as these weekly sessions are enough to keep me from properly using my time during the rest of the week, be it a lack of good sleep as I'll spend more time in bed, effectively wasting my mornings, a lack of exercise, and generally not doing other things I would want to. In sum, this is working against my well-being.

I want to mention that these friends of mine wouldn't stop hanging out with me if i stopped smoking, and my interest in them is deeper than just some smoke buddies.  
Knowing this, I could just do the weekly visit and be with them without partaking in the smoking part, but I find it difficult even to just decide and try to do it, and I believe I would easily succumb to the temptation.

So, the solution I see is reducing the time I spend there, just going for the class time and staying the minimum needed while I wait for my bus or something.  
This is not something I want though, as I like to spend time with them.

Here's what I learned,"I already talked in great length about me quitting weed, here was the post I made :  [9 days sober now. Seemed impossible a month ago. My (modest) advices for you : leaves (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jm4r01/9_days_sober_now_seemed_impossible_a_month_ago_my/) 

I stopped on the night from October 23 to October 24 and it's November 24 now. Exactly a month ago. Here's what I learnt : 

&#x200B;

\- I still think about weed everyday. However, I think less of weed that I used to when I smoked 8 joints a day. It means that in a whole month I received no THC in my body and I still think about it less than when I was rolling a joint while smoking the end of the previous one. Makes you think.

\- Stopping weed doesn't make you motivated. However, it makes you realize what a dumpster fire you let your life become while you were smoking. It forces you to act and do stuff instead of smoking it out. This might seem bad but this is a very good feeling, accepting reality for what it is.

\- Leaving weed is kind of like becoming an adult, you have to take responsibility for everything now. there's no crutch. There's sadness or anger in failing and there's true joy and happiness in winning. The thing is : you win everyday. Everyday is a victory. It's an other day where you fight against your addiction. It is a very rewarding feeling, you feel really proud. You feel even better if you do something everyday, like cleaning or working or studying or whatever, do something that makes you feel productive at the end of the day and you're good. 

\- You might think that weed makes you dumber or that you lost your short term memory forever or stuff like that but there's one thing you need to take into account : The effects on your mind do not only come from the fact that you smoke weed everyday, it also comes from the fact that you are high everyday. It is normal to have a bad short term memory or feeling unable to focus if you're high. Being high everyday makes you think that you are your ""high"" self. You're not. You're much more than that.

\- You will not erase all of the consequences as soon as you stop. One month in and I still have insomnia some nights, I also have a lot of brain fog and unability to focus hard, but I still try everyday and it improves everyday, trust me.

\- Your real self is not that anxious about everything. Weed is making you like that

\- Dreams are literaly the best thing on earth, so vivid and true-like. Way better than any high you can get with weed. Stopping weed is worth it for the dreams alone.

\- You really don't need it to have a good time my dude, life is much better when you're in control. I know this seems kinda dull but it's true, it's much better to be yourself and to accept everything than to hide everything behind a cloud of smoke.

I hate that I've been smoking for so long. I hate that I was introduced to it by someone who should have been protecting me from addiction.

I think there may be some deep seeded issues regarding weed that is making it more difficult. I don't know.

I just feel like I'm at rock bottom. I skate by in life by doing just enough to make it seem like I'm driven but in truth I'm capable of so much more. I could have a better job. I could be even more present in the moment with my children. I could take my writing more seriously. I know in my heart I don't want to smoke but I'll be damned if I'm not scared to death to take that first leap. I don't know where I'm going with this.

We became probably best friends at the end of middle school (13-15 years age at my country) then we weren't seeing each other very much, and then we started smoking weed together. We were seeing ourselves just when we smoked or went drinking and last year also as a gym buddies. But we don't workout anymore and now I am sober for 2,5 months I think I should get rid off him. 

After some time of sobriety I became to the conclusion that I should get rid off that guy for good.

Here are my reasons for it and I would appreciate your input... if you think that I am overreacting or not.

Before I start  let me say that my only way of obtaining weed was through him because I didn't have my dealer anymore. So everytime we were buying, or I needed werd, I had to obtain it through him. 

1) When we were buying weed together and I was giving 40$ and he 60$ to buy 100$ together, he refused to give it to me for that better price (because we were buying for 100$ together which means better price)

And then, when we switched positions, he had no problems with me giving 100$ and he giving 10$ and   suddenly he took it for that better price, which we got because of me! Because I was giving more money.... Really fair dude... 

This happened several times, not just once. 

2) I also think he lied to me. Because I was giving him 20$ to get me 3g  he got it to me and then next day he suddenly had weed also. Which means that he also gave him 20$ and got 7g instead of 3 and he gave me only 3. Basically same situation and when I confronted him about it, he said that he didn't buy it at once, when I was giving him those 20$ which is completely bullshit. 

3) Then, from time to time, He starts to call me names for no reason, just to feel better for himself I guess. This is the biggest reason why I want to get rid of him. He acts like it is just fun, but no one laughs, not even him. He thinks that he is ""tough"" for playing games like these, pathetic af.... 

4) When we were smoking, I always drive with my car there, for the past several years, he drove to my place just once when we were smoking. When I wanted him to come to my place because I was drunk and couldn't drive, he told me that it would take too much time.... It was Friday at like 3 PM and it is 30 min long drive with a bus. 

5) When I am sober, I don't even want to talk to him, it gets boring with him pretty quickly. 

6) He isn't even able to admit how often he smokes weed before some random chicks he never saw before.... fake ass 

7) Last time I smoked weed, it was with him and we were scheduling lunch tomorrow. That we will go on a lunch because I will have night shift on that Saturday . I call him the next day (Saturday) and he tells me that he doesn't have time right now. He acted like he forgot or whatever... I could have confronted him that we were scheduling it like 12 hours ago but I just had no energy to do that, I just said bye and have not contacted him since. 

He wanted to go to the lunch like 2 weeks after that, I said no and we haven't seen or chatted with each other since that. On top of it, he irritated me way too often with his behaviour. 

I dont want to see him anymore. But am I overreacting? What do you guys think? I think I should have get rid of him long time ago, but he was like my only source for weed, which is now thing of the past. 

I would really want him to be like he used to be, but that guy is probably gone for good.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998953104019165}"

I haven’t smoked for 12 days and it’s the longest I’ve ever gone since I started smoking when I was 18 (21 now). The two exceptions are when I went on vacation with my family and I was a crazy moody touchy anxious bitch for the first 2 weeks every time. I started smoking weed to sleep and would be a night thing but two summers ago is when I started to wake and bake which eventually led to smoking weed every day all day. I smoked when I woke up, to feel hungry, when I was bored, when I was stressed, when I was tired... I couldn’t function without it. 
Last winter, the peak of my depression, is when that habit was at its worst. I realized I could do everything, even my schoolwork high (the only exception was my job, I could never be high for that-too much social interaction). My grades did not suffer so I just kept smoking uncontrollably, thinking I was just living the functional stoner life... but It got to a point where I felt empty inside and depressed all the time and started to isolate myself and not want to be around people, i was living in my head 24/7 with all my thoughts (not all good). Being high wasn’t the same and just brought more emptiness... It hurt me and the people around me to witness because I’ve always been super outgoing and full of good energy, and everyone misses the “old me” (I hate hearing that, makes me feel like an empty shell). 
University has negatively affected my mental health and that combined with weed made me hit an all time low. I knew for a while smoking was bad for me and I finally broke down and quit. It was awful the first 5 days, I was an emotional, anxious and sweaty mess but now with day 12, the physical withdrawals are almost gone but it doesn’t change the fact that I still miss weed so much... when I’m bored and my mind runs off I can’t help but think about it. I’m determined to quit cold turkey and smoking has not felt like an option, which is great and all but I gave myself a whole month no weed as a goal. I’m setting boundaries to not go back to my old ways because I want to have a healthy relationship with weed like everyone else around me (only smoke here and there) but I’m scared I’m too weak and will use it to deal with my mental health and get addicted again.
Also, I still feel emotionally not as stable as I want to be and still get bursts of feeling empty and kind of hopeless. I just want to know if there are any more and better changes I should expect in the next few weeks and if it gets any better... will I ever go back to my old self? How long would that be considering how long and how much I smoked (21, F, 5-10 bong rips a day). Will I ever find satisfaction or will weed always feel like the one who got away? I just want to know how long I should restrict myself to get to where I want to be- no better. Any advice helps, thank you so much!!!",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976803064346313}"

sorry for the word salad;

Hello, hope you are good. This might be a lengthy one so buckle down. When I was 15 I was an incredibly naïve child, my cousin was the first to let me try weed in the Netherlands where it's legal and I thought ""well fuck it might as well"", this has lead me down a path of total self destruction and mental health issues. I had started really getting in on smoking bud all day every day when I was 16, everything was totally fine but by March 2019, just after turning 17 I fell into a heavy depressive spiral. I entered a relationship with a girl I didn't even like just for sex and this caused me to have very deep OCD thoughts that were never before prominent and heavily exacerbated by bud. My life had consisted of getting in trouble at school, weed and other bullshit that now looking back on was a terrible mistake. Around July of 2019 I fell into a deep psychosis and started to hurt myself in various ways which I now regret due to scarring and because I was in a deep depressive dream state from the weed that I just held on to dearly and would not admit was a problem for me, this lasted for a fairly long time. Around Sept. of this year I had decided that enough was enough and that I'm cutting weed out of my life. I finished my last spliff, ashed it, put it out and decided to move on. For a month I was sober, and decided I want to light up again and so I did, this caused a nightmare high where I was seeing all my worst fears come true and thats when I decided that that was it. I fucking hate weed now, and I hate how all my buddies are just now starting to smoke it and are having the time of their lives. After 2 months (one relapse) I still see no improvement in my mental wellbeing at all but I can only hope for a better future.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975519776344299}"

Earned a masters, have a good paying job and a family.  But I've also been to jail and feel like I have settled for so much less than what I could be.

It's crazy how this drug brainwashed you into believing things that just aren't true.  You think you can have it all.  You can smoke and be creative but lack the follow through to do anything worthwhile.  You think that you need it to help your anxiety but it really is making it worse.  You think you need it to be social but it really makes you socially dysfunctional.  You think its normal and harmless but then you realize you just think that because the only people you've ever been close to are addicts in denial.

I'm 26, still in school, and I can't seem to put my life together cause all I wanted to do was escape from my problems and get high.

I’m finding it hard, very hard. There’s nothing to do, especially now that we are in lockdown. I have picked up reading again (starting game of thrones books) but when i feel these boredom spikes coming on, my mind instantly reverts to “get some weed, you won’t be bored anymore” even though my boredom is most likely product of not having weed in the first place. 

Will this feeling ever stop? The feeling of emptyness when your stone cold sober with nothing to do but lie in bed and stare at the ceiling. I just want my mind to stop defaulting to weed whenever there is nothing to do.

Every day last week I've been telling myself that tomorrow would be the day that i stop. I figured if I took the first step in making an introductory post then that might assist with me getting started.

So I'm 27 I've been smoking weed on a regular basis since I was 18 with the longest break being last year for 6 months. The ONLY reason why I was able to abstain for that long is because of some very close and intensive help I was given from my family. I plan on making a post sharing my experience about that at some point in time. 

Most of my issues I face are self inflicted and maybe 90% of the issues are a result of my abuse of weed. The abuse leads to me being fiscally irresponsible ,lazy , unmotivated, socially limited. This plant has literally controlled my life for the past 10 years. My entire adulthood. 

On a positive note , Im blessed to say that in May of 2021 I will be bringing life into this world. A beautiful baby girl will walk this earth because of me and I have to make sure that I'm the best version of myself possible. 

Tomorrow 11/24 will be my Day 1. ( My day 1 was supposed to be last week Wednesday. Smh ) The good thing is I started working out again last week and I’m already seeing progress so I will be using fitness to replace weed. With that being said I have to get used to not hitting the blunt a couple times as a pre workout before the gym or a run. 


I think it helps if I'm active in this community by posting and sharing my experiences with sobriety as well as sharing negative experiences from my past which can help with closure. So I will be keeping you guys updated on my progress throughout the course of this journey as I've seen other members of the community do.

I just increased my medication the night before so obviously that played a huge part. The tachycardia was incredibly intense, and one of my personal anxiety triggers. I got super introspective the whole time and spent the high trying to figure out why I was so fucked up but ended up just feeling grossed out. I couldn’t even look at my dogs without my brain trying to find little things about them that triggered me to think about my own shortcomings. 

Then the hunger kicked in, but halfway through eating the disgust became too strong and I got sick. I think it was also in part my medication, because it’s supposed to give you nausea, but obviously everything I was doing right then was a part. 

I got so delusional and paranoid about myself and it kind of sparked an identity crisis, because now that I’m sober I’m realizing how much I was letting myself slip, in terms of mental health, and I hate the person I’ve become.

Holy shit I made it to 4 months. I'm getting into the swing of my new job, which has made this month brutally difficult, but not one slip up.

Okay so rehash because my past posts have not been very detailed.
I started experimenting with weed at 16 (I'm 23). It honestly was never my favorite drug (I'm already pretty bad attention/processing speed wise and I can't really socialize on weed). But somewhere around 18-19 it became a really bad habit. I quit for the first time at 20 but eventually convinced myself I could do moderation. Don't try that shit. Before you know it 2 more years went up in smoke. About a year ago I quit after hitting dab pens for a month. Those pens made my memory/learning ability go to shit FAST. I HAD PANIC ATTACKS EVERY NIGHT. I eventually caved and went back to flower and another year went by. I finally quit when I graduated from uni 4 months ago. 

Now symptoms.

Month 1:
Daily panic attacks, constant suicidal thoughts. Almost unable to speak. Paranoid, splitting headache, some random fits of intense euphoria. I was lifeguarding, luckily nobody died. Insomnia

Month 2:
Calmer but still constant headaches, anxiety, depression, apathy, low libido, repetitive thoughts, ocd tendencies. Memory worsened during this period. Disorganized thinking. Insomnia

Month 3:
Worst month. Still crippling headaches. Tennitus kicked in this month. I had to switch adhd meds to reduce anxiety which helped some. Started having ""nonsense thoughts."" Just words and phrases swirling around in my head. For example ""ducky ducky"" over and over. Like what the hell brain? Chill out. Cognition continued to worsen. On the plus side my sleep improved. Now all I can do is sleep. Started trying to socialize again despite head pain.

Month 4:
Tennitus is just about gone. It was partially caused by allergies. Still in sense brain fog and lack of memory. But my ability to think coherently has improved. I'm just thinking... Slow. The headaches have lessened to a dull throb and ive been more able to get help. I'm getting checked out by a neuro. I visited the ER after an intense panic attack. The CT scan came back normal and they referred me to a psych. I'm getting blood word done to check for diabetes (I have a family history). And I'm visiting an allergist to make sure nothing in my lifestyle is worsening the brain fog. Also I've been getting intense excersize induced brain zaps. Mood is still low. This process is very tiring. I've managed to repair relationships with my parents and home friends enough to have a support network, which helps.

Possible brain damage symptoms.
Okay In terms of permanent changes my doctors say they will probably be very mild and all/most of it is probably my brain readjusting and anxiety. In terms of what I still notice every day/all the time.

Brain fog
Awful recall of places and events
Poor vocab
Even slower in conversation than when I was smoking.
Very poor focus and energy
Sometimes my coordination is off
Dp/dr especially after panic attacks. 


Positive advice.
1-make no weed/booze/caffeine/nicotine a rule. They will all make things worse quickly
2- drink LOTS of water
3- excersize and sleep as much as possible
4- change is slow, if all you can manage right now is a walk after work that's better than crashing on the couch.
5- if you're anything like me reacclimating to ""normal"" society has been brutal. What works for me In social settings is to bring a water bottle to keep my hands busy, smile, laugh, and just don't say anything too stupid. You'll be fine, nobody is gonna be like ""look at this fucking drug addict, where are your drugs drug addict."" I've actually picked up some decent friends during this process and I am 100% not fun to be with right now. 

Hardest part
Depression/anxiety. Goddamn just the length of time I've had these symptoms is draining. If anyone has any tips to make anxiety/brain fog dissapate faster please hmu.

Peace y'all,
Stay safe stay sober",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998954176902771}"

Things are calming down now. My life has a more solidified routine. I'm started to get excited about normal life things again. I no longer think about weed all the time. It would be difficult for me to explain how I did it. In years and indeed decades gone by I had tried before, many times. Each of those times I knew in the back of my head that I would be back to my old lifestyle. I wasn't ready to leave it behind yet I knew the damage and destruction it was leaving in its wake. The guilt I experienced because of the choices I was making and knowing I could do better were probably the largest contributor to the fuel that stopped the addiction. The second biggest thing, I think, was changing my mindset. My whole life changed, I did it on purpose. I took on new hobbies, I pushed harder against my fitness goals, I began to improve my relationships with other and my relationship with myself. I started viewing myself as someone I should care for and treat better. It was a vast and far reaching change, the biggest change I ever made in my life without a doubt.

But it was time to say good bye, I can't jog more then a few steps without my lungs burning, the pile of shit I keep missing was piling up. I used to brush it all off, but I just can't do it anymore.  Weed brought me and my friends together, in past my girlfriends all joined me, I saw absolutely no reason for me to quit. Without going into the lurid details, i finally had my come to Jesus moment and realized I needed to quit. I'll be honest at first i thought, I'd be done in 3 days, then boom! I'm normal ( for lack of a better word) but uh uh, nope, each day has brought lows and with each day passing, i realize how much of my life ( and money) i wasted on weed.

I gotta admit, day 1-3, were hell, zero sleep, zero nada, i woke up with a headache and went to sleep with a headache, it felt like a band of pain wrapped around my head. By day 4 i realized I needed to take some time off work and work from home ( I'm so grateful I had that opportunity) it seemed like sleep and the headaches were the worst aspect of this ( besides the realization of how much of my life i wasted) I'm now on day 9, my sleep has got slightly better, but every night, my sheets and pillows are soaked from sweat ( if anyone can explain this I would be appreciative) I get up to pee at night and when I get back in bed, its freezing because the pillows and sheets are wet. On the bright side, I wake up with a boner, which say what you will, I'm calling it a good sign. I'm working out now in the hopes of getting my heart back in shape, I'm sleeping longer, still not 8 hours, but a respectable 5-6, the fact its progressing makes me think I'm on the right path.

I also have a very supportive wife, who has never smoked in her life. Good side she understands, bad side, I don't think she actually realized how much i actually smoked. She's trying to be supportive and because of that, I'm working my rear off to not let the emotional ups and downs I'm getting effect her.

I have so much work to do right now im stressed and I think I'm trying to avoid that. I spent the whole day masturbating basically as an equivalent to not smoking, but its pretty much the same waste of energy.

Over the month and a bit I've not smoked I've deepened my commitment to being sober and stopped smoking tobacco, touching other drugs and drinking alcohol, even caffeine. I guess I feel besides the occasional pack of crisps, masturbating is the only form of instant satisfaction in giving myself. If that makes sense? Like sure I can watch a video or spend time with a mate but its not the same instant satisfaction based off pleasure receptors as drugs, food and sex. 

I really am struggling at the moment cause I'm swamped with all these deadlines and I'm behind on my work. I just feel overwhelmed and want a relief. 

I know it might sound excessive dropping even caffeine, but I've been happy knowing that all my energy is coming from myself. I've needed to feel more in control of my body for a long time. Right now though I don't feel that control, because I can't get myself to work and the masturbating always has me turn to smoking, not cause of any inherent disappointment in myself, love a cheeky bash lmao. Just because I'm in a pleasure seeking to avoid the stress mood and when I'm spent the only way to get back to it is to smoke... 

Not really sure what advice I expect to hear or encouragement especially with all the jerkin' gherkin chat in here, but any support is appreciated rn. 

Bit of context of the type of stress I'm under: studying a law degree (behind on reading and deadlines upcoming), living mostly alone (I'm mates with some neighbours), obviously off drugs, just got news my mum is being made redundant, also working part time but might lose that job myself.

Tldr: been over a month since I smoked, I'm really stressed with study, family and work rn and feel like I want to smoke after a long day of doing nothing. Support would be nice.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975335597991943}"

I find as soon as I do it regularly (which is to say any time I have some on me), it becomes so central in my life. I'll still more or less manage to get my obligations out of the way, but any personal project or ambition takes second place to smoking. It might get done, it might not. I'll think about it after the joint.

In the past, I've never managed to stop/take a break from smoking without physically eliminating the substance from my home. Having weed in the house makes it so that I can't just forget about it. It is a constant little ""devil on my shoulder"" tempting me, and I prefer to eliminate it. 

For the past couple months I had been doing alright. I would sometimes fall into the trap of buying a bit. Bad week, but at least I knew I'd be fine once I got rid of it. 

&#x200B;

A month and a half ago, I rented out my spare room. The roommate is jobless and always home. I am also home a lot, as I am working remotely. He smokes & consumes edibles.

I've told him before that I struggle with limiting my weed intake and that I'd like to stop. I've asked him to keep the weed out of sight. He's agreed to this, but still smokes himself. When he does, he usually asks me if I'd like to partake. I sometimes stay strong and refuse the joint. Even then, I know there's gonna be a half-joint left on the windowsill the next morning. Again, I might resist the leftover joint in the morning too. Key word ""might"". 

His stance is that we are each grown men and can take our own decisions. Live and let live, basically.

Now that's all fine and dandy in principle, but at the moment his lifestyle choices make mine a whole lot harder to live by.

-when I smoke, the other, irresponsible me takes over

I think so anyway!  

First let me start off by noting that I hadn't told anyone I quit smoking. This is because last time I quit, I was doing so well, I made it a month and a half!...and then quarentine happened and I convinced myself it wasn't worth staying sober anymore and that maybe I could be a weekend smoker or at least save it for at night. This was a huge mistake. I went right back all day every day smoking. It affected every aspect of my life yet again, the very reasons I quit in the first place. 20 years of smoking daily! Quitting for a month and a half was the hardest thing I've ever done, and I immediate regretted choosing to smoke again.  

Getting back to the point of this post, the reason I chose to quit and not tell anyone this time, is because I still didn't trust myself to stick with it. I didn't trust myself to stay accountable so I didn't even want anyone knowing I'm attempting to give it up again.  

So when an amazing opportunity came into my life to go on an awesome road trip with my two close friends, I couldn't pass it up! I was however extremely nervous because they are both stoners and love to smoke in the car on road trips. I told myself 10 days into quitting, well, I'd rather go on this road trip so might as well start smoking again (like immediately since I was setting myself up to fail on the road trip anyway).  

Well, instead of keeping quiet about my anxiety and disappointment that I didn't actually want to stop quitting but felt so weak, I did the opposite. I reached out to some people and told them I quit and how I was feeling about this upcoming road trip. They were so supportive and asked me how I'd feel if I happened to get through the trip without smoking. I was like, ""I'd be so proud of myself, I'd feel like I could accomplish anything!!"". So we we went through the pros and cons of giving into the urge, and I started to think, hmm what if I did challenge myself?! 

So the morning of the trip I decided to tell my friends I was trying to quit. I told them I was going to let myself have the option to smoke if I really wanted, but I'd like to challenge myself not to. I let them know, ""no pressure to smoke less, I want you guys to smoke whenever you want"". They were very supportive.

So I challenged myself, joint by joint (they had to have smoked more than 20), just to get through each joint, go with the flow and see how I felt.  

The first joint I was anxious but started to relax after the next one, realizing I was kind of enjoying the smell but WASN'T even craving it! I started to realize, hey I'm being a lot more social with them since I'm not high! And joint by joint I got through it! 

We ended up going hiking and seeing waterfalls. This experience was so exciting and therapeutic, my adrenaline was so high from nature that I DIDN'T EVEN CARE about the weed!!! In fact on the way home I was so damn proud of myself that I knew I wasn't even going to want to smoke because I made it that far!!!  Today is day 14 and between the hiking itself (scary and challenging) and not smoking, I feel UNSTOPPABLE!!!  

I've realized personally, the thing that's working for me is the freedom to let myself slip if I want to. This freedom led me to take it into my own hands and CHOOSE not to smoke, instead of I'm not allowed, it was I don't WANT to! 

Today I feel empowered and I really hope perhaps my story can help others feel inspired to be creative with their own quitting approach. Cheers to freedom and gaining our power back! If I can do it so can you! 💪",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.5700585842132568}"

I’d also recommend not putting any pressure on yourself with what you could/should be doing, go at your own pace and don’t feel bad if you can’t live the sober life you want straight away, starting the journey is something you should be immensely proud of in itself, and you can gradually build up to it.

I've been subscribed on and off for 2 years, sometimes reading quit stories when I'm high and thinking ""fuck yeah, I'm gonna do that too!"" to actively ignoring all the success stories to sooth my own guilt whilst sparking up. 

This year has been rough, for everyone. And my biggest and only vice has been weed. I ran up a massive debt (that I would never have admitted to anyone, especially my husband) but my dealer was my mate, and thought he was helping by laying me on so much on tik. It was my big cozy hug. And nothing mattered as long as I had my weed. 
Last week I went round to my mates to pick up and bitch to him how my alkie father had, that day, been admitted back to hospital after a few weeks of nothing but laying on a sofa drinking red wine. I got no answer knocking on his door. Then his neighbour opened his window and beckoned me over to his flat. He told me my mate had been found dead on his bathroom floor that morning. I'd only seen him a few days before, and he did look like he had lost weight. But refused to see a doctor because ""covid"". His neighbour told me they thought it was cancer and he'd been suffering quietly for months. I hadn't even noticed, probably because I was too concerned with getting my fix and not on my friends wellbeing. It's knocked me completely sick. And the most disgusting thing that flashed through my head was ""well, at least I don't have to pay that money back"". Fucking revolting. What a fucking sick puppy I am. Horrible. 

And there I was 2 days later, bawling my eyes out down the phone to my brother because I didn't know how I would get through the night without weed. And I picked up. And I've spent the last week stoned as fuck. 

I've just opened a business with my best mate. I've got a wonderfully accepting and loving husband and two beautiful, caring, funny, clever little girls. 
What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. Me? 

I used to smoke because I had nothing. Now I have it all and I'm still doing it. But I'm going to loose it all if I go on like this. How much more of a wake up call do I need then my father being hospitalised for addiction and my friend/dealer dying on the same day? 

So in spite of my father and in memory of my friend, not one more puff. My anxiety is already churning at the thought of going home from work and having no weed but I'm so determined to get through this and be free from it. 

I'm going to look into exercises to help me exhaust myself and help me sleep, and try and get back into regular mediation. I'm also going to increase my water consumption and watch my caffine intake. Has anyone else got any other tips on easing withdrawal symptoms? Especially when the voice comes whispering tonight about how easy it would be to climb in the car and, half an hour later, I could be smoking. That's the hardest part. 

Thank you to anyone still reading, a lot of this was to put it in black and white for myself, but I will take any words of encouragement or advice.",8,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988760352134705}"

After getting sick of wasting money and having the climax of my day being waking up and smoking, I decided to take drastic measures. Long story short, I moved across the country. Can't get green if you're socially challenged. Can't get green if you don't know anyone. Especially in a rural area like this. Even if colorado is next door, I see no point.

Ngl, it was fun while it lasted. I do miss it, and I don't plan on being some sort of anti drug god fearing loon. I do plan on smoking again. Just not nearly as much. And not making it a habit at all. Like how it was when I was a teen. Like, once a year, or twice. But anyway, I don't think I'd have time.

As soon as I got here, I bought multiple drug tests and as soon as I was clean, I'd go get a real good job. And I did. Kinda. It pays well, but the managers are complete trash. But it doesn't matter. Tomorrow, I'm swearing into the Army. It was an uphill battle to even get in. It was like climbing a mountain getting to this point, being clean ""or else"".

I'm pretty sure that dark part of my life is over... Looking back, it's really odd thinking about how much that stuff controlled me, how much it had its own say in ""my"" decisions.

I’ve been browsing this sub for over a year looking for support in quitting. I actually joined reddit just to post here today in seek of some good advice and support. I’m not actively involved in social media of any sort for years, so this is my attempt at finally reaching out to get help. 

28 year old guy here, started in high school. Was actually kind of anti-drug up until grade 10-11. Around then I was intrigued by weed and what it would be like. I did it. And did it some more... through different experiences in my teens and 20’s (jobs, moving to new places, relationships) weed as always there.
But as time when on it became clear I had a problem that was getting worse and easy to justify.

I have a great work ethic, and drive. Through those 11 years I’ve achieved some personal/career goals that took hard work and nothing less. But I could never let smoking weed go. Over those years came lost opportunities with jobs, financial losses, anxiety, addiction, lack of social skills without being high. The list goes on and on... literally 

I’ve wanted to quit for YEARS! I truly feel like a slave to weed. Every night and weekend when I’m bored I pace my apartment and get high wishing I could quit. It’s hard to admit real addiction but this is where I’m at. 

There’s so much to say but I’m at the point in my life where weed doesn’t work and I want to close that part of my life and move forward. Enough is enough. I want a sober and healthy life again. 11 year is where it needs to end. I’m starting this journey of sobriety and r/leaves has been a great source of motivation.

I decided to sit in the car.  She came back with a vape pen and a few different carts, and immediately started hot boxing (well as much as one can with a vape) my car.  Shit did it smell good.  She offered it to me repeatedly (I think more out of courtesy rather than pressure).  Ultimately I declined but struggled each time.

2020-11-22 19:47:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jz7e47/a_turning_point/,A turning point,"I've suffered from addiction problems most of my life. My substance abuse never really went beyond marijuana and alcohol (I've been to in patient facility for alcohol 4 years ago while I was enlisted), and I had a really bad marijuana problem in my late teens; but I've always had a pattern for self destructive behavior and taking the easy way out. I also have a mild retail/shopping addiction, though thats under control for the most part. 

During COVID, I started smoking regularly again on weekend nights, and hiding it from my S/O of almost 4 years. We've lived together for about 3. This was compounded by my inability to have difficult and constructive conversations, and in the last year, I emotionally cheated on her twice. There was never any flirting on my end, never any nudes or anything sexual. They were more just seeking comfort and validation from outside sources rather than dealing with the underlying problems in myself and my relationship. Over the last couple days, I've begun revealing the secrets I've kept from my S/O, the most critical of them being the emotional cheating and the marijuana abuse. After some long talks and her confiding in close friends, she has decided to try and go the path of forgiveness. I realize that I am extremely lucky to have received that sort of grace from her, and that others may not have the fortunes that I have. Nevertheless, the pain I feel now for not only letting down the love of my life, her friends, and my friends but also myself continues. I know I have a long road ahead, and there's some light at the end of the tunnel, but I feel so crappy. More than anything, I was guilty of not being open and honest with my S/O. The panic attacks are always a breath away, and its scary to try and work on my relationship and myself at the same time. I don't know how others feel about addiction being a disease that we inherently have a biochemical disposition towards, or it being a result of not learning coping skills (Asian American so yes, tiger mom and perpetual disappointment to family). I, for one, believe the emotional cheating ie finding comfort in unhealthy and sketchy ways, the substance abuse, and the shopping addiction stem from a lack of the ability to communicate and cope healthily. COVID-19 hasn't been too bad on us (again, I understand how lucky and privileged I am in that aspect), but I felt isolated and lonely from the lockdowns, and smoking weed was a way to cope. The lying was to not hurt her. But I can't live like that anymore. I can't always take the easy way out. Facing my fears head on, and learning to actively work towards positivity is something I've avoided my whole life. My journey began yesterday when I finally came clean about everything (that I can remember.... I'm sure some smaller stuff has been compartmentalized), and I just want to say this:

Whatever you're going through when it comes to addiction to marijuana or substances, or life at large.... I feel your pain. I may not feel all of it because of my privilege, but I get it. You are not alone. And I hope I give someone some posi vibes that we CAN be better. Its not easy, but its there for us. What you go through is real, and I am praying/thinking of you.

I still love weed. Of course I do. Who would consistently do something for so long if they didn't love it? But it's been holding me back, for fucking years, and I've always known it. I remember writing down ""Weed is my kryptonite"" in a notebook in 2002. I remember throwing a bunch of weed out my window in '97 because ""I just wasn't getting anything done."" Well It's now 2020 and I think this has to be my.... 6th month of smoking non-stop, less than a 2wk break between all purchases of weed. The things I could have now done with this time. I'm pretty mad at myself to be honest. Cos I've done nothing. 

I'm actually a pretty decent writer. I've written quite a few screenplays in the last few years. How many you think I worked on since the pandemic. If you said FUCKING ZERO congrats, you were SO RIGHT! 

Weed makes you dream big, I have cool thoughts all the time, but my actual world? Is quite small. I have just spent too much time playing computer games and getting nothing back. If I don't make a change soon, I'm going to be a 50yr old guy smoking weed all the time, still talking about his dreams, with NOTHING to show for it. And that just seems so sad.

I just want to do something with my life before it's too late. Because we don't have forever. I probably have 25years more to do something, but only if I start now. I mean, what am I waiting for? There is literally nothing now to wait for. I'm a fucking grown man paying taxes and working jobs. Tbh it's not that great that I should be just kicking back and chilling all the time. If I actually put some work again, I could make big things happen. But weed is antithetical to getting shit done. 

I've had decent periods of sobriety over the years so I know what to expect. The last times I stopped the worst things for me was 1- everything is a drag for a while afterwards and 2- I have to resist the self mental nagging to maybe just try a little, maybe this time will be different, I've been so good I deserve a reward, that kind of stuff. 

When it comes down to it, I've been getting high or drunk for 25 years now and it hasn't really helped me out. I DID almost die more than once from acute alcohol ingestion, and I also feel like I've wasted almost a decade of my life on weed. I know I would have a very different skill set and bunch of life experiences now, if I'd never gotten into it. Honestly I wish I'd never tried it. I would make a lot of decisions differently if I had my time again. Basically since I got into drugs and alcohol, I've always been looking for opportunities to do drugs and alcohol. Which has meant always taking the easy path through life.

I have been moved to Tears three times by that poem that keeps getting posted around here (""My laughter is sweeter when I am sober""), but never stayed sober. 

I've been smoking the last 4 years of my life, started when I was 16. I'm done. I have always been high functioning (hehe). I  kept telling myself I could smoke and do everything I dream of, edit videos, work out, draw and read, play the guitar like a muscial fucking genius... Well I couldn't. Here's a small timeline of my thoughts these past days:

&#x200B;

* Wednesday: Me and my friend studied for 2 hours - I didn't want to smoke, since I had planned on quitting, but my friend kept pushing me, so in the end we did - I felt like a tool.
* Thursday: I wake up with a foggy mind due to smoking the day before, but it's sunny outside for a change, so I feel motivated. Noon rolls around, I take a walk with the same friend. We both say It'll be the last time for this year. So we each roll up and toke the day away, not being productive like we planned on.
* Friday: I wake up with an even foggier mind and after being unproductive, unmotivated and all around  lazy the whole day because I smoked the night before, I do what any sensible person would do - I decide I still have cravings for weed because I haven't properly said my goodbyes yet and need to do so ceremoniously. I buy some again and promise my dealer I'll give the rest to him if I dont manage to smoke it all. I plan on smoking the whole night away, playing the guitar, drawing, reading and and and. I smoke even more than I usually do, eat, watch a dumb sitcom and fall asleep by 12pm.
* Saturday: I wake up hazy as hell, I still have weed left - of course I tell myself friday wasn't the real deal, I have to use again and have an absolute blast. Well, I didn't. I didn't do shit. Because I was high and lazy, I just sat around like I have a can of beans for a brain and fell asleep. All the while listening to dump trap music about taking and trafficking drugs and killing people, like ""yea I'm cool, just chillin'"". Then cried before I went to sleep. No apparent reason. Maybe my body just processed my situation faster than my mind did. Didn't give the weed back for simple reasons - because I'm addicted and I wanted to smoke it.
* Today: I wake up absolutely destroyed, eat junk food the whooole day and watch netflix. Not because I particularly enjoyed binging shows and food, but because it made me forget I don't enjoy it at all. Kept thinking about scraping together bits of weed. Thinking about it right now actually.

This is the last straw. I'm out this bitch. I'm craving as I'm writing this, but honestly fuck that.

Just a bit of background info:
I’ve been smoking none stop every day for around 5 years now. Obviously there has been the occasional break when going on holiday and not being able to sort any, but other than that it has been pretty much been none stop. 

The main reason I’m quitting is because I’ve already been disqualified from driving and if I were to be re-disqualified, that would put me in a very bad position with work etc, and of course the length of the ban would be, well, pretty lengthy. And I don’t know about anyone else, but I think driving around constantly scatting out and looking in your centre mirror for a fed just cruising behind you is definitely the last thing you want to be doing.

Another reason is because smoking is no longer the same as it use to be. I now smoke to get by rather than to get high. 

So my prior bad choices have now led me to right here typing this haha.

2020-11-22 17:29:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jz522q/35_days/,35 days,"Ive always been a loner and was bullied a lot in school so I don’t really have a lot of friends I can really talk to....I’m married to a wonderful husband and I have a pretty good support system when it comes to family but...it would be nice to have a few more friends to talk to 

Here’s the nitty gritty story....

Around August/September 2020 I stopped using my mental health medication completely cold turkey. My reasoning was that I was diagnosed with IBS a few months prior and I honestly thought that my medication was causing my GI issues (it’s a very very small factor but the main cause of it was years of extremely poor nutrition and a sedentary lifestyle with little to no excerise). Before stopping my medication cold turkey, around a year prior, I became a very heavy pot user. 

I kind of fell in love with pot. Like a bad relationship I always came back to it even when I wanted to stop (mainly for financial reasons) because I have convinced myself that it was ‘medicine’. My usage became so heavy and problematic that I was smoking about an oz of weed every day - every 2 days. Not just smoking too; ontop of all the smoking (up to but even MORE than 20 joints a DAY) I was eating edibles like it was NOTHING and also smoking carts. My tolerance was INSANE. I used to joke about how I could challenge Snoop Dog and Willie Nelson to a smoke off...and WIN. 

The main reason why I started in the first place was because I have IBS (the nausea kind not the other kind) and I just HATED with an ABSOLUTE PASSION feeling nauseous everyday. It was the kind of nausea you couldn’t ignore, up to the point that you have a voice in your head telling you that you should induce vomiting because it would make you feel better. Thinking back now I probably reacted like this because I kept eating multitude upon multitude of trigger foods due to constant munchies. It was a repetitive never ending cycle. Eat, get ‘stoned’ (which became essentially my new ‘sober’), eat, get stoned, sleep....

My life essentially had no meaning during that time. I was a shell of a person, I stopped going to school for my Masters degree...all I did was sit outside from sun up to sun down just...smoking. Through all this I also essentially got my husband into debt due to my habit. I want to say this; when you’re struggling with a substance dependency issue...you’re not yourself anymore. You become almost this calculating manipulative person where if people are attempting to warn you of the dangers of your activities...you just start crying on cue to get them to ‘shut up’...atleast that’s what happened to me. I kinda was a shit wife for about a year...I’m just very happy my marriage is strong enough to pull through that year....

So around October 16th; my husband had a very strong and adverse reaction due to our cannabis use (he used with me but very sparingly) and I had to take care of him for the few hours that he was having this experience. The morning after I had some of the worst anxiety and panic attacks EVER. I mean I couldn’t say ANYTHING besides the words ‘Yes’ ‘No’ and ‘I don’t know’. All I did was pace around the house and beg to the sky to ‘make it stop’. It got to the point about 3-4 days later where my husband decided to take me to the mental health urgent care that was 30 minutes away from us. 

I’m glad he did. I was able to get back on my medications and after a long and hard talk with first the practitioner, my husband, and then my mother; that same day I threw all every single piece of paraphernalia and product I had in the house.

I’m now 35 days sober and 35 days back on my medications. It’s been kind of hard; the sleepless nights, the constant heart palpitations. Throughout this whole experience I’ve also connected with a bunch of new doctors and went through a mental health IOP (they kind of messed up and the prescriber from the IOP kind of turned me into a science experiment...) I do have to say I’m doing a LOT better. I’m now on medicine for my heart palpitations (I think those are caused mainly from me cleaning out my system). I feel healthier, but I still...I guess I’m still having issues. I feel kind of empty in the sense that I don’t know what purpose my life has, what I should be doing. I know I’m currently in recovery and should be taking it ‘easy’ but I’m afraid I’m going to go back to my lazy habits. I want to improve and be a better person...Im also seeing a therapist...I just don’t know what to do with myself sometimes. I do understand as well that this is a process and I just have to go through it, with time and patience in my heart. It’s just so hard...and I guess the reason I’m making this post is to reach out...maybe get a few pats on the back and telling me good job for what I’m doing...I don’t know...

I do feel a lot better writing this all out...and hopefully maybe I can get some friends out of this...I basically lost all friends I did have due to them being of a similar lifestyle choice that I was having before and they did not respect my decision to quit...

Started smoking at 18, and I’m now turning 29 in a few months. I started slowly realizing how bad weed was for me at 22 and have been “trying” to quit ever since. I was previously engaged to a college sweetheart I was with for 9 years, and my complacency is what caused my fiancé to leave me out of the blue. I had been a stoner the entire time I was with her. 

I always blamed myself for prioritizing weed over my relationship and I absolutely hated it. During times in our relationship, if I were at her house, I would start getting anxiety because I wanted to go home and still have time to smoke and watch tv (because I had work the next morning). I hated that feeling. It was as if weed was my second girlfriend and I spent more quality time with weed. That’s just one of the issues I have with weed but it’s the one that bothered me most. I would rather be by myself and smoke weed than spending time with my significant other, friends, or family. 

After the breakup, I tried going to therapy and got sober for 3 months! After COVID, I decided to stop therapy because it was all over FaceTime now and it just wasn’t the same as going in person for me. After the 3 months of sobriety, I had relapsed several times and had a few mini streaks of being sober. Like 1 week off, 2 weeks on and so on. Fast forward to today, my smoking has gotten completely out of control. As soon as I get home from work, I get hella baked until I go to sleep. Often times I’m just sitting on the couch watching tv, eating junk food, and smoking until I go to sleep.

I feel like I’m at an all time low, and the feelings of depression, loneliness, and anxiety are extremely high. The first few days are ALWAYS the hardest for me, as the only thing on my mind is “I wanna quit,” and each time I fail I beat myself up even more. If I can just get a couple of weeks of being sober, it definitely makes it easier for me. Of course cravings still come up, but it’s easier to not want to break the streak. 

Today is the start of the second day for me, and I’m concerned I won’t be able to make it. Trying to take this a day at a time, so my goal is to just stay sober just for tonight. And tomorrow, to stay sober just for that night. Hopefully I can break this down into smaller goals, and get over this habit forever. I want to say that in the future I only want to smoke during special occasions, but I don’t even know if that’s a good idea given that I am an addict. 

I find that this community has helped me a ton. If I have cravings, going to try to come back and post each time. Good luck to everyone out there starting their journey of sobriety!",14,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990363121032715}"

My mood sucks today. I feel pissed-off, angry, reactive; find myself wanting to make biting, sarcastic remarks (that would be my anger); want to shut down, close off; say “fuck it” to everything. 

I’m already pretty isolated with COVID-19 and my area is going to shelter in place again today because of the spike in cases, and is imposing a curfew again. 

I’m not going to smoke because I really can’t afford it. OTOH, I went through my “budget” today and I’m going to be a couple hundred dollars short on rent on the first. Addict Brain says, “You’ve already fucked-up. What does it matter if you fuck-up some more? You’re already a loser, just own it.” Everything feels so f’g hard right now. 

I’m really fighting the shame cycle right now. I’m angry at myself. I’m embarrassed. I’m ashamed. I feel like a loser. Part of me wants to say “fuck it” and blow my system out with something that will numb me out. Rational Brain is still onboard and reminds me that will solve nothing. 

I’m trying to stay focused on seeing that the “shit days” are part of recovery; that my Addict Brain still wants to go to escapism; and am just generally in a funk (probably due to still detoxing). 

I’m eating good. Getting plenty of sleep (although have had insomnia the last few nights). Keeping myself hydrated. Have been jumping onto the Discord chat in the mornings at least. That’s a new thing for me—had never used that platform before. 

I’m sorry for the negativity today. I usually try to be uplifting and supportive, and can do that with other people. I just feel like I’m under a steaming pile of shit today and that really sucks.

Around two years ago I starting smoking pretty regularly. Eventually this developed into a habit of me using weed to go to sleep almost every night, and I did this for a few months. After a few weeks or so, I started to develop constant fatigue, depression and anxiety, and an odd pain in my right lung. These symptoms got progressively worse to the point where every waking moment in which I wasn’t high was torture. I somehow kept trying to deny the fact that I was addicted or that any of my symptoms were caused by weed. At some point I quit cold turkey, and I’m grateful I did.

It was initially extremely difficult to sleep, and I really struggled with my anxiety and depression, since I couldn’t use weed to numb it. I think I used melatonin the first few nights to go to sleep. After a few weeks, my symptoms started to go away.

There have been only a couple of times (literally only 2-3 times) where I’ve smoked since I initially quit, but extreme anxiety always ended up rushing back to me. Because of this, I decided to really quit for good.

Some people can live happily smoking. For others, we’re better off without it, and there’s nothing wrong with either side. But don’t let your friends’ actions convince you that weed = happiness. Stay committed to your own smoke-free path, and I can guarantee your quality of life will improve greatly. I am in an infinitely better place than I was at two years ago. I am much more in touch with myself mentally and emotionally, and I’m much happier.

My advice is: find ways to deal with your symptoms outside of smoking (I used melatonin briefly), and distract yourself with healthy activities like exercising. Stay committed to yourself and constantly remind yourself that you’re doing the best for you; never forget that.",32,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9238964319229126}"

I’ve been a habitual, daily smoker for about a decade with random bits of being totally weed free and enjoying it thrown in there. One was the summer after I graduated college and lived with my parents. I actually had a decent amount of weed with me and just had no desire. Moved to a new city where my only friends were stoners, fast forward through a year of daily smoking. Jan 2019 I did a sober January that carried over a bit into February because it felt good and then fell back into daily smoking until Jan 2020. I was totally weed free from Jan 1 to mid March when I moved and we found a random bag and figured, fuck it, nothing else to do in quarantine. Here I am 7-8 months later starting from scratch from, once again, daily smoking. 

We finished our most recent purchase yesterday agreeing to make it our last. Like that recent post mentioned, I’m a fully functional addict. I go to work on time, I pay my bills, I handle all of my responsibilities. I’m just sick of spending money on something I don’t even enjoy anymore. 

I had thought maybe knowing that being sober feels so much better would help but every time (I’ve told myself I’m quitting over and over these last few months) I’m shocked at how empty time feels. I’ll give myself credit for the fact that this is the first time in months I’ve made it as far as not purchasing more when I’m about to be out.

As you can imagine my finances were incredibly tight. 4 months sober, and financially I'm doing so much better.

And I am SO ready for christmas this year folks! Ive not thrown together last minute gifts for family members like I do every year, I've an amazon list put together, I've asked people what they want instead of going for the cheapest option I can. The kids I made sure always got a decent Christmas, but this year I've spent that little bit extra, I've gone a little wild, truth be told. 

My eldest loves minecraft and dan TDM and I've been able to afford lots of merch for her, some new ps4 games, a whole nerf set (ok admittedly it's a twin pack because it's for me too, LOL) , craft supplies, a new rose gold controller for her ps4, hair chalks, and more. My son loves baby dolls (he's like a proper little dad with them its adorable) so hes got a full toy travel system for the good quality realistic doll I've got him, and hes got everything for the doll; nappies, bottles, change bag, clothes, bath, you name it. We are even doing home made advent calendars with proper mini chocolate bars and little toys! (Mine will contain Yankee melts, expensive but affordable. Yay!) 

My family have wonderful gifts also, usually I scrimp and buy only for people I will be seeing over christmas, this year I've bought for everyone regardless. I've already ordered most of my kids things, most of which are already wrapped already and hidden in my wardrobe. The last of the needed funds are here Monday and I've a wishlist ready to go on my amazon account. Waiting on photos of my kids together when they see each other weekend coming, for photo gifts (youngest lives with dad as me and son share a physical disability) , and some parcels to arrive, and I should be all set for december the first! That's not like me at all, I've NEVER been this organised.

 I've never been in the Christmas spirit until the day of, because of stress and panic, and being so broke. It's usually a depressing month, and full of resentment everytime Christmas is mentioned. Not this year, my friends. Quitting weed was the best thing I've ever done. I've been able to go all out and be ahead of the curve for the first time EVER. I'm like a big kid again, I'm actually excited! I'm obviously not going to be smug about it as I know it's a hard year and people are struggling, however wanted to share here about my success since quitting weed as I knew you guys would understand.

When an episode occurs is random but typically it happens every few months if you continue smoking cannabis. And when I say the nausea is extreme, I'm not exaggerating, it is the most excruciating nausea you will ever experience in your life. Most episodes will end in multiple ER visits and a few people have even died because their kidneys shut down from the dehydration caused by the vomiting.

During days 25-35 my sleep was terrible - I often woke up in the middle of the night from extremely vivid dreams. This is finally beginning to stop recently. 

I can actually remember stuff without writing it down now - I'm no longer dependent on a notepad to remember things. 

I am used to waking up at 6am now and plan on waking up even earlier (445) so I have more time to work on my personal business before starting my 9-5 job - financial independence is coming soon.   


I stopped listening to violent rap music and have become more calm. I still listen to hip hop, but only music created by ""enlightened"" artists, even songs talking about smoking weed, but just treat it like a metaphor now. 

I now exercise twice a day, a very light and short half-mile jog in the morning, some pushups if I feel like it, just to get my blood flowing and brain working. NOT to get fit. 5pm I'll go to the gym and pump out a weight workout, or kickboxing/wrestling

TIP: chug 2 cups of water as soon as you wake up! Many people confuse dehydration from exhaustion. You can go back to sleep for 20 minutes after drinking water and wake up feeling 10x better. 

TIP2: Get sunlight exposure (particularly the white parts of your eyes!) your brain releases wakefulness hormones in response to sunlight. 

TIP3: Walk at least 5,000 steps daily, preferably in nature. Nassim Taleb Nicolas said: ""walking is poorly understood, but walking deprivation is as bad as sleep deprivation. I walk about 2000 steps in the morning, 2000 after lunch, 3000 to/from the gym after work and 1000-3000 more after dinner. 

These 3 habits have CHANGED my life as much as quitting weed

I have also abstained from sex for 6 months, this has saved me a lot of time and money. I also quit social smoking and drinking completely - this has helped my mood, skin, health and money. I also learned who my true friends were after doing this. The final step is to quit porn and masturbation to get even more energy back to chase my goals.

2020-11-21 22:10:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jyofma/3_am_sobriety_and_whale_analogies/,"3 am, sobriety and whale analogies","Hello there!
Its 3 am, I'm sober (as the title suggests) which hasnt happened this often lately. The reason I am sober is because i slept all afternoon after smoking this morning (starting at 7 am), so when i went to buy some at night they were already ""closing"" and didn't have anything left. 

So i recently became a teacher, this is my first year. And this year is the year i got better at getting sober, because a lot of things changed for better in my life, and because i've read so much about addiction and read people sharing their experiences.

So 2020 has basically been one month sober/one month smoking for me. And when classes started i quit, then i relapsed at fall break.

September was great, i was sober, lucid, discovering a new job (that i enjoy a lot)... I've never put a lot of effort into anything so working on my classes was a good feeling of accomplishment,  and i was feeling great, didn't even remember why i used to smoke.

Then came the fall and i got bored. Then i got covid a few days later (i barely felt sick but had to stay alone for two weeks). So i relapsed. And classes have started again and i'm still getting high every day. And my work is sloppy and I'm feeling overwhelmed again. It's like your life gets so much better when you're sober you forget how you are when you relapse...

So now I'm back at it, every day i decide not to buy more, rolling my last joints, only to struggle with the cravings for a few minutes before going out. The fact that there are dealers 2 min away from my apt doesn't help... The dealers see my at least 4 times a week (10 bucks gets me through a day) . It embarasses me bc if i smoke that much, why dont i just buy more once instead of a little every day? Not bc I'm confident it's the last time I buy but bc if I am gonna buy, I need to convince my moral self that its exceptional. I'm kinda like a 5 year old that wants candy and the parent that goes ""okay but just ONE"" . Both of them negociating inside my head the whole day, every day, until I get high.

I feel like buying strong liquor (i was watching something and people were drinking scotch), sometimes i feel like experimenting with other stuff. Not because I think it would be good for me. But because of that ""voice"" that just wants to be dead without dying. And I dont even feel that bad! I just feel bored and dont remember how to live life sober. Even when i quit i still had to have some beer/wine at home ""just in case"" i craved something. 

I could go on and on and on (i forgot why i wanted to post in the first place). But what really bothers me is the feeling that there's nothing I can learn (from books, from my therapist, forums etc...) that will make me different. I love to analyze things, and myself. So i try to look at this thing rationally. I know it's related to my emotional stiffness. I know it's something i use to regulate myself. I know the effects it has on my brain. I feel like a whale that gets stuck on the beach on purpose: I can see my actions leading me to a bad place but I just keep swimming. Maybe they're afraid to live their lives in the ocean with other regular whales doing regular whale shit. Maybe they dont want to be a regular whale but they're conscious they can't be spectacular so they sabotage themselves... 

Maybe sometimes it's not about what you don't know but what you can't admit. I'm afraid of failure so i smoke so I can't really say I failed because i didnt really try. That's what I did throughtout college (any other gifted high schoolers who couldn't get shit done in college then got high?), give minimal effort and be satisfied with a minimal result. Then being ""proud"" and looking down on people that work hard for their grades bc you're a fragile snob. 

But now I feel too old for that attitude. And while I don't care a lot about college grades I do care about the quality of my work and what the students get from it. Plus time flies soooo fast when you're high daily. September felt like 3 months and october like a week to me. I don't want to finally quit 10 years from now, regretting all the stuff I didn't do/learn how to do. 

The hardest part is not finding out how the addiction works (although it's necessary, of course), or why you smoke, or what triggers it... The hardest part is convincing yourself that you can be sober. Imagining yourself living another life and actually liking what you imagine. My problem is I'm not sure I want to be sober, although I know I dont want to be high.

The dude's face lit up!  He said, ""Really?""  

""Yes, sir,"" I said.  Handed him the bag of paraphernalia, and the lighter too. 

Dude is SO happy.  He says, ""Thanks!  This is great.""

""My pleasure.  Be safe and be well.,"" I said. 

Walked away.  Walked to the grocery and bought potatoes, Brussell sprouts, onions, and some creamer for my coffee in the morning.  Got a nice veggie dinner cooking on the stove as I type this.

I'm not bragging, but it was a minimum $100 when I went to the farmacy.  Almost always bought an extra bat (large joint) or two, because, gee, I didn't want to run out.  Always needed that extra supply on hand.  

I just feel angry at myself about it right now.  I know, I know--you can't recover sunk costs, and there is nothing productive about dwelling on it either.  

About the best I can do is every day:  Draw a line and remind myself today is a new day.  Today I stay clean.  Today I am making better choices and decisions.  Today is all I got.

It’s been 4 months since I quit and have been doing cardio for the past 2 months of it by running on a treadmill, eating 3 times a day and tryna drink 2-3 L of water a day. 

My symptoms I’m still battling with is : 
1) Shortness of breath 
     • I get this from time to time it’s gotten a lot better but my breathing is still long not as short or normal as it was when I was smoking, but like I said ever since I’ve been doing cardio my shortness of breath has gotten better but I still deal with it everyday 

2) Chest tightness 
• now this is one of the worst feelings ever, before I quit when I was on month 1-3 of quitting my chest was so tight I thought I was going to die, it was hard for me to focus but now I see it getting a little better, but I still deal with my chest being tight everyday from time to time 

3) Heart palpitations 
• I believe I got rapid heart beats and sometimes it feels like my heart is skipping a beat , due to heavy tobacco / nicotine abuse and now that I quit it’s getting a little better but I still deal with it

I was wondering if anyone has dealt with these problems and have any stories that are encouraging or anything like that as it’s really hard for me cause no one I know has gone through this at all. My friends are still heavy smokers but don’t seem to be getting affected by it at all. 

Notes: when I was smoking I was 115 pounds smoking 10 blunts a day filled with tobacco and weed I barely ate max 2 meals a day and didn’t drink that much water. I am now 126 pounds drink 2-3 L a day and eat 3 meals a day and do cardio and weight resistance everyday or every other day at the gym . Been sober for 4 months now.

Made the decision to stop smoking weed 3 days ago due to a mystery night sweats issue.

I have been smoking weed regularly for about 6 months (I know, not as long as some people in this sub, but for me it’s pretty significant) and the past 2 months have seen me get the night sweats every single night. I stopped for 1 night a couple weeks ago and still sweated so I figured it wasn’t the weed.

I have been to the dr and they are running all the tests on me to see what the underlying root cause of the sweats is, and I’m hoping it is the weed giving me the sweats because then I don’t need to stress about it being something serious. 

Tonight will be my third night no weed and i have seen on this sub in the past that night sweats are a symptom of weed detox. On the first night no weed I sweated, but it wasn’t the worst night sweats I’ve ever had. On the second night it was only a light sweat, but enough that my blankets were a little damp.

1. Did you have night sweats from smoking weed?
2. Did you have night sweats from detoxing from weed?
3. If yes to Q2, how long did they last?

I’d really appreciate any info you can give me - the whole night sweats ordeal has been very mentally taxing and I’m kinda losing my mind!

So my trajectory for a crutch started when I was 18 and deeply afraid of the world around me and having absolutely no confidence in who I was. I went to the casino with friends and **loved** it. Like, I will never love anything as much as I used to love gambling.

Well that never ends well does it? 11 months off the bet now after six years in active addiction and four years of various degrees of trying.

Problem is I turned to alcohol during the Bad Years and **loved** that too. I could write my own version of ""Drinking: A Love Story"" and fill hundreds of pages with memories from the Glory Days, which were 10% about the bonding I had with friends (none of whom I even speak to anymore) and 90% my all-encompassing internal universe blooming into this warm, ethereal world upon contact with alcohol. I was gambling, thinking about gambling, drinking, or thinking about drinking for the vast majority of the time and I honestly didn't think too much of it, even though I had a vague sense of unease  about my life and my future every day. I didn't believe the future would happen to me.

And then right before the peak of my gambling addiction where shit just hit the fan -- I mean it was just flying everywhere -- I discovered marijuana from a Spokane Valley dispensary and it scared the piss out of me. Absolutely blasted me away from this world and did it in about 5 seconds, from a single puff on a pipe. Could not walk for the first minute; I remember stumbling toward the couch and hitting my head on the wall. And then two minutes of panic, then thirty minutes of giggly fascination with the universe I found myself in. And then when the trip started to fade, I realized that the whole experience was unbelievably cool and I wanted that again **right now**. And so I smoked more.

It was shortly after then that I had The Summer From Hell, where I had no job, everything in my life was deeply wrong and I felt it in the core of my being, and I tried to placate myself with weed, constantly. Not just daily, but constantly. I'd wake up and tell myself ""today was going to be different"", then get high and when noon rolled around and I realized I hadn't actually done anything, a dark cloud would grip me until nightfall. I'd try to pretend it wasn't there, but it knew that I knew that I felt its presence. Then at night everything felt okay. Rinse. Repeat.

My finances were in shambles, I was being kept afloat by monthly checks from dad and those often went into a slot machine or a dispensary and Ramen noodles. I missed rent twice. I had absolutely no confidence in myself and I could not see a path out.

I continued smoking and started becoming convinced that my breathing technique was wrong because I could not get anywhere near as high as I used to. If I was being honest with myself, I saw no noticeable effect at all. I became suicidal and my behavior started becoming more erratic with each passing day. Near the end I would take long drives around the town I was living in at the time trying to feel any sense of calm at all. A drive used to give me that. Now I just felt like I was grasping at straws to keep myself sane. Sometimes I'd get so frustrated that I'd go 100 down a residential street just to try to feel anything remotely good. I remember feeling, really feeling, that the world is a cold, calculating place, that existence itself is not just burdensome but evil. I would call the suicide hotline and sometimes that would help.

I finally broke down and began to recover for my gambling with the help of the only two guys at the Gamblers' Anonymous meeting that one night. I moved back home and started job hunting, no weed was available (that I knew of at the time. I've since learned that weed is *always* available.). I was actively enjoying my recovery. But two months later (still cannot believe it only took that long) I relapsed.

Since then I found the ideal job for someone in my exact position, with coworkers who I click with and whose company I pretty much universally enjoy. Shortly after I started this job, I found out my cousin smokes and I got back on the weed train. It was nice. 

Then one day in the following February, I smoked a batch and after one particular rip, I felt a deep pulsing pain in my chest. I felt my head go ice cold and my heart start to thump. I was absolutely certain I was having a heart attack. I came out and told my dad, he called 911 and then as soon as he connected with someone, I realized that maybe it was just the weed fucking with me. We cancelled the ambulance and I drove myself to the hospital. My dad followed, which I wasn't expecting. So when the doctors asked what was wrong and my dad was right there, I just told them I had a panic attack and they gave me a $50 Ativan. (It turns out that I love Ativan, too.)

The past three years have brought me professional success. I continued smoking off and on during this period and every time now, I get into deep monologues in my head and feel a vague sense of shame that I always try to brush off. I have a hard time parsing out what is authentically me and what is the weed. I come away often feeling disoriented and confused. 

Last year I fell in love in Colombia with my first boyfriend and Sinalgen Max, which towards the end I spent $400 on in a single month. During this time I had my first real professional bomb and fell back into gambling at the ground floor casino in the building I was working in. When I came back home, I felt like I was being ripped apart from my own world and coming back home yet again was a traumatic experience, placated by the Ibuprofen bottle full of $135 worth of Sinalgen I had prepared myself with. I regretted not bringing more.

It's been a rocky road since then. My work life is not exceptionally good now: between that and my dive into proper non-functioning alcoholism during the first round of quarantine, I've lost a lot of trust. And my plans to move back to Colombia and live some more months with my boyfriend have been squashed by COVID, which could not have happened at a worse time for me. I miss him everyday and sometimes have a good cry about how much I miss my life down there, but sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to miss it, or that I don't actually miss it and I'm playing tricks on myself. Who moves to Colombia on a whim??

Lately I've been using kratom. A lot. (Me? No!) Like, 'withdrawals when I first stopped' a lot. I quit it for a 3-week span during a time in which I presided over my friends' wedding and it was such a special moment. Immediately after that wedding, on the ride home, I had an honest conversation with myself about how even though I was grateful I was fully immersed in that day, facing my normal reality was making my tummy turn. That cloud. There it is. So I bought a bag and smoked it when I got back home, and the conversation continued.

I'm in Idaho so I'm surrounded by **idiots** of the highest caliber in this pandemic and god dammit if that just doesn't piss me off and make me want to run away and I can't. So I stopped my Antabuse 11 days ago and I drank and got high again last night and got so, so gloriously fucked up. But I couldn't even maintain a conversation with my boyfriend and in my heart, didn't feel like I even wanted to. I was feeling all the love I needed already within myself from the crossfade -- my absolute favorite high of all.

That realization bothered me this morning. So I smoked to try to ease the disconnect and immediately fell back into the headspace of guilt and feeling disoriented and confused and scared about my life. I don't want to be confused and scared anymore, I've had enough of that feeling to last my damn life. I can escape it for months, even a year or more on some stretches, but it claws its way back into my head and I recognize it like an old friend right away, and I know that once it's lodged in my head it's not going anywhere for awhile. Unless I tell it to be quiet for a bit with a substance or a bet.

Now that I'm not high I Just wanted to get all this out because I always think about typing this and never follow through. Is it stupid that I still feel like my usage isn't the worst thing in the world? Like after typing all this out, my heart is still not convinced. I tell myself that this is in no way hurting me as much as the gambling did, but is that true? I'm in my late 20s now, am I going to be traumatized when I'm 30 because I still don't feel confident in my life trajectory?

I open my journal that I only write in when I'm sober and I see a guy who sounds happy, who is ""so grateful"" he's ""doing this"". But I also know that that guy had a constant sense of unease in his heart when he wrote that. Or do I? Does my recall of how I felt back then matter more than what's on the page? I guess that's the thing: I don't trust myself and my own perceptions anymore. And I don't know whether that's my underlying anxiety, the weed, or a genuine judgment about who I am.",26,"{'quarantine': 1, 'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9947579503059387}"

Almost everyone that i used to see during the day (friends) smoke  so now I don't see anyone anymore bquz i don’t want to surround myself with people that smoke. i feel very lonely now and the lockdown bquz of corona is only making the feeling worse bquz i don’t know in how many months i can go back to work.
I know this is better for me but the lonely feeling is really getting me depressed. If i know that i don’t have to do anything during the day i just can’t get myself out of bed . what are you doing to fill your day? 
thanks again for this page, it has already helped me a lot and whenever I have a hard time I can get motivation here to keep going.

It's so hard to break and I probably sound like I'm just making excuses for trying to quit this long, but I somehow keep finding myself drawn back into this life along with issues of depression, anxiety, and having a messy disorganized mind and life.

I also got a addiction to a nasty otc substance that I actually found out about on a subreddit and it is horrible. I went to rehab for that twice. I've managed to get my job back that I quit without notice. I also managed to cut down to just 3 hits off a roach a night. And then it became a full roach. I also went through a nasty nicotine addiction that I thought I had beat. But here I am, sitting with my disposable vape again. I was doing good on cutting down caffeine, but here I am again drinking 3+ cups a day.

I also managed to cut off and get away from old bad influence friends I had. And now, here I am. Hung out last night and smoked a shit ton of weed, esp. for my tolerance. Woke up today feeling terrible. I'm also on antidepressant and a sleep aid medication so I know I cannot be doing this while I'm on this stuff.

But still nothing seems to heal my addiction. I primarily smoke weed but I find I have an addictive behavior towards everything. And here I see myself, slipping again. I have to be at work soon and I smoked this morning with my ""friend."" I keep asking myself as I'm doing these things, ""WTF are u doing and WHY!?"" but I keep doing them. Cognitive Dissonance at its' absolute finest.

And now tonight I already agreed to come to his 20th birthday party, which he'd announced is gonna have loads of alcohol and weed, which is just the norm for the old crowd of people I use to hang out wtih. It sucks because he's a good person deep inside and a good friend, but I know I have to let go of all the times we shared because we are going on different paths. He's not really going anywhere and partying or video gaming and smoking his life away staying inside all the time while I have plans to live a great, prosperous, adventurous life. He's content with having no life while I'm not content with this life I've set out for myself.

I just want to break free so bad man.

I'm very spiritual and it feels almost as if the devil, or this negative energy is just holding onto me so tight and I'm trying to escape.

I know I can do this. I just have to stop making stupid actions.

Ugh. I'm very frusturated because this addiction and mental health issue has been the overlying topic about my teen and adult life now. Well, young adult because I'm only 18 lol. But seriously man, I've been smoking since 13 and I'm tired of this. Ever since 14 I knew I wanted to stop but couldn't and just continued to hang with those people, try new drugs, and live in mental torment all the time.

I'm tired of this life.

I used to be ( until now 🤣) a daily smoker of weed, it has been part of my life for the past 4 years, since I went through a difficult breakup. 
I just stopped once for eight months when I lived in Qatar, as the law is super strict and it isn’t worth the risk. 
Still, I found the way to spend all my holidays or free days in countries where weed was accesible. In a way my life and decisions are determined by the addiction.

I literally smoke from the moment I wake until I go to bed, one blunt after the other 😓 my tolerance is crazy right now, had to spend lot of money to actual y feel the way I used to at the beginning. 

The only person who knows I even smoke weed is my boyfriend who lives with me, who by the way is so healthy he doesn’t the even drink alcohol 🤓 
My family doesn’t know about this and would never understand and I don’t have friends who smoke. So you can imagine how lonely and hard has been keeping this addiction to myself. I really wonder how nobody has ever noticed, I sometimes stay in my mom’s house for weeks and still find the way to be constantly high.

I have a a successful online business, that allows me to be my own boss and work anywhere I want. For other people I might be well balanced and successful, but I know I am far from that. I get constantly frustrated for not working at my best and giving my full potential. People don’t know I have a big anxiety when I need to travel far or spend many hours out of my house. The fact that I must go home to satisfy my secret addiction has make me isolate from many people and activities I love. 
So, I decide it’s enough. I want to do it for the little me, maybe the 5 year old Mila who dreamed about doing big things in life. I’ll do it for her, because I know my reality wouldn’t  make her happy. 

It’s not the first time I’ve tried quitting, I’ve even succeeded a few times. But it’s always the same, something bad happened, my mood goes down and I find comfort in weed.

Let’s see how this story continues. 😊
All the best for all of us!

Smoking multiple times a day, everyday. This is the first time that I have ever done this well. 

Some things that helped me:

Long walks: Long walks in the morning with some tea and some music have definitely helped calm my nerves in the morning and it helps me think about what I want to accomplish and adds perspective. 

Cardio: I have been doing cardio in my room every day towards the evening. Towards 6 -7 Pm. It really gives me the relaxation I need that takes away that physical stress towards the ends of the day (When I crave weed the hardest)

Melatonin: I have been taking melatonin pills to help with my sleep, it wasn't very helpful the first few days but now that I have been sober for a while, it really helps.

Fun Fact: I still have all my weed. I found that I kept throwing it away and then buying it again, leaving me broke! Now I have it in my closet. In a strange way it takes away some of it's power. Instead of thinking ""I don't have it and I want it"" I think ""I have it and I don't want it"" which has been a healthier and less stressful mindset to have.

I’ve been smoking heavily daily for over 5 years now. I work nights at a club and I always excused the habit as something I needed to be sociable and fun in work, and something I needed to get some decent sleep after I finished work. I noticed my tolerance and usage sky rocketing but I always told myself at least I wasn’t drinking every-night or doing hard drugs like a lot of my colleagues.
Due to covid my club has been shut since March, and everyday since then I have sat and smoked from the minute I woke up from the minute I went to sleep. I carried on making excuses for myself over the past 8 months, what else do I have to do other than get high? The worlds way too much right now I didn’t want to be sober for it. 
I tried to quit a few months ago after realising just how much money I’d spent on weed when my income has dramatically reduced but I just couldn’t deal with the withdrawal. Headaches, hot and cold sweats, shakes, no appetite, throwing up, my vision changes and I get a beautiful hive like rash all over my face. So I quit quitting. 
After that I couldn’t stop thinking about what the fuck all this weed I was smoking was doing to my body if I was reacting like that from two days of no smoking. I’ve been consistently high for so long that I don’t really remember who I was before. I grew up around addicts so I don’t know why it took me so long to recognise myself as one. Weed has been my coping mechanism, and it’s also taken priority for a long time over friends, socialising and my responsibilities. 
So second attempt. Day 5! Feels much different this time, I think because this time round I have better reasons than just saving money. I wanna figure out who I actually am and I finally have accepted I have do in fact have a problem with weed. I saw a post on here that’s really helped me push through the withdrawals, once I’ve done it once, I won’t ever have to do it again. Because I’m NOT going to smoke again. Really kept me going through the sweats and shakes and thank god they seem to be on their way out. 
I thought I’d struggle sleeping much more than I am but I’m beyond emotional. Which I don’t think I mind after not feeling much for so long. Found myself hysterically crying about things that happened years ago, which I must have needed. 
The only thing really bugging me is this huge rash on my face (I don’t think there’s anything I can do other than wait it out) and I haven’t been able to stomach anything but cucumber over the past 4 days. any advice on high calorie food would be so appreciated. Sick of being hungry but not being able to swallow anything I eat.

I was a good kid, never drank or smoke until I went to college. Within a month, I started drinking heavily every chance I could to the point where I was hospitalized twice. No more alcohol for me, didn't need a depressant on top of my depression so I moved to weed. It started with just occasional usage at parties until I started work at whataburger where my coworkers invited me to smoke after every shift (sometimes during).

It turned into daily use, lighting up in the morning, before work, during work break, after work, before sleep, repeat. I got another job as a pharmacy technician, what I wanted to be my main career, but my addiction got me fired thrice. After each termination, I stopped smoking only long enough to pass a drug test for the next job. For the last one, I had relapsed and ended up cheating using a friend's piss. Having another person's piss inside you is a low I wasn't expecting to reach, but I kept smoking. 

Weed wasn't the only drug my whata friends got me hooked on. One got a hold of some acid tabs and I bought one and had an amazing experience. I didn't know the rules to tripping safely and was too high to be bothered to check, so I ended up tripping 7 times in five months with the closest trips a week apart. The last trip was my one and only on two tabs for a friend's birthday. I got sick, had a meltdown and just a horrible trip. I knew I had royally fucked up when the psychosis started. It lasted 6 months, probably would have been shorter if I wasn't still smoking weed every day. I got fired from my last pharmacy job over the summer, now I'm working at a bowling alley. I tried to quit smoking after my last termination, but my boyfriend was still smoking and let me join occasionally. By this point I haven't had a good high in almost a year, I'd just get paranoid and anxious, and I still couldn't stop.

I found this subreddit a little while ago and have been lurking, getting inspired from everyone's stories but still not having the motivation to dedicate myself to quitting. Well, it finally happened and I'm so angry at myself for letting it get this bad. 

I had a psychiatry appointment this morning where I asked him to read off my diagnoses and found out I have panic disorder and severe cannabis use disorder (in addition to my MDD, PTSD and ADHD). My CUD has worsened if not created my panic disorder. I'm on new meds that will help but my quality of life is completely (hopefully not forever) altered. I'm a paranoid anti-social hermit who's been high in hiding for the past two years. I don't know how to exist in society and just came here to share my story.

     Today marks 75 days without weed. I am 23F and was a daily, chronic, and addicted smoker for 8 years straight. I couldn’t imagine my life without being high and every time I tried to quit (over a handful of times) I couldn’t never make it past a couple days. If you’re trying to quit, I realllly suggest sticking out the first couple weeks. I truly believe the body gets physically addicted and gets really sick without the weed at first. The night sweats, the nausea and poor appetite, the fatigue and anxiety, ugh...everything was terrible. The physical withdrawals are the  hardest part in my opinion. But it gets better. It truly gets better. It happens day by day and everyday you just say “no” is a day you won’t regret the next day. 

About two weeks ago I was offered a hit off a joint in a really abnormal situation and I was so detached to it that I was like sure... (and I wanted to know how it made me feel because I had no idea anymore what it was like to be high even tho I had done it so many time) and I took a hit. One hit. And I hated the way I felt. Disconnected and out of touch with my true emotions. My heart rate went up and I got the feeling of dry mouth. I literally went dumb and couldn’t think or talk like normal. I am so glad that I took the hit because it clarified all of the thoughts I had about smoking. I can’t believe I used to smoke 3 blunts/joints back to back and now just one hit is enough to have me wishing I could be sober again! So many times during this journey I wanted to go buy weed but now that I tried it again I want nothing to do with it. I don’t see my hit as ruining my progress, but progressing my progress even further. It was a lesson I am grateful for. 

Now I don’t even have those thoughts of “maybe smoking will make me feel better” when I am feeling depressed or anxious. I have no desire to smoke and I love the sober life. I have a clear head and feel more confident in myself. I am able to feel through my feelings, moods, and emotions. I’m not worried about being high and I am not putting off my life to chase a chemical reaction in my brain. I am so grateful to be alive and able and I don’t want any substance getting in the way of that! 

This is a journey and there will be hard times but if you stick it out there are great things waiting on the other side. Keep pushing through guys. 

According to the app “grounded” I have avoided 228 joints and saved $1,142 dollars. My health is better, mentally and physically and emotionally. I’m not worried about being high or smelling. And I have no FOMO about weed. I really can say I feel free from the shackles of weed that restrained me for so many years. Leaving was one of my best decisions ever.

2020-11-20 23:31:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jy4mqd/my_experiences_with_weed_over_the_last_few_years/,My experiences with weed over the last few years.,"This is the first time that I have ever felt the need to write a message on Reddit, so here goes nothing I guess...(I apologise in advance if I ramble on)

Over the last 3-4yrs I would say that I've become addicted to weed, which is something I never thought would be possible. For many years it was the 1 drug that I didn't like, if it didn't get me 'fucked up' (in a good way) like other substances then I just wasn't interested, I always found it to be 'boring'.

However, this all changed a few years back and before I knew it I was smoking everyday. Being able to perform day-to-day activities and upholding a job when smoking weed is quite easy to do. At my worst I would say that I was smoking around 1oz (28g) a week. 

I have a very hyperactive mind and weed soon become the one thing which would calm me down, and let me brain switch off for a while. For me, weed has always been about relaxation. However, without knowing it, it slowly became an integral part of my day and the idea of not being able to smoke would make me feel quite irritable. Food wouldn't taste as good if I wasn't high, and TV and films wouldn't be so enjoyable if I wasn't high. 

Things with my girlfriend recently began to suffer because of it, and in no uncertain terms she told me that I need to sort my life out, and she's right. Sometimes it takes someone close to you to tell you that enough is enough. Even though deep down I knew that weed was beginning to become my downfall, I always told myself 'i'll quit tomorrow' but tomorrow never comes and the cycle continues.

Now at the point of writing this message I'm on day 5 of no weed. I set fire to all my weed related products in some sort of weird ritual and vowed to quit, and so far I've done just that. It hasn't been easy but it's not impossible, it just takes willpower and the ability to say 'NO', and not crave into temptation.

I often read other posts from other Reddit users on the Leaves page and have taken inspiration from them, so I guess the message that I want to convey to you all is don't wait for tomorrow, quit today if it's what you want to do. Don't waste time, because let me tell you now, the last 3-4 years whilst I was smoking weed every day has flown by. Time has never gone so quick. All the days seem to merge into one and time is the one commodity we don't get back in life.

On the surface weed seems fine, and to 99.9% of people who can smoke a joint once a week as a Friday night treat, or with their friends occasionally then sure, carry on. But for most of us in the Leaves page we don't have the ability to do that, and have since become consumed by it.

Hit the gym if you're finding yourself with too much time to think! It's the perfect thing to replace weed with, at least for me it seems it is.
Drove past my dealers house on the way to a friends house yesterday and thought about getting some for the night. So glad I didn't, I woke up early this morning and went straight to the gym, smashed a workout and had a 30 minute sauna and 10 minutes in the steam room. Feeling HAPPY AS FUCK.

Still working through the PAWS and depression. 

Month 1: manic, angry, very anxious and depressed, suicidal, very bad physical symptoms. Everything I had repressed over the years surfaced.

Month 2-4: Same, physical symptoms gone after 2 weeks.

Month 4-6: working through the issues I had repressed for years, got revenge (bad idea). Had to delete Facebook to stop my angry rants. Put on mirtazapine, seeing a psych team from the hospital. Anxiety lifting, still very depressed. 

Month 6-7 (present): new job, I'm holding it down ok. Depression on/off. Anxiety pretty much gone.

Weed wasnt the soul course of my issues, but it definitely made me worse. I isolated myself and loved to be on my own, just making music and watching shit on TV. Met an amazing woman in Sweden who made me realise how empty my life really was. 

Quit and tried turning my life around, but everyone at work hated my new found confidence and wanted to beat me back down (people don't like to see you change, it shows them how they haven't got the guts too themselves). Started smoking shit loads again, had a psychotic break down because of the ""bullying"", ruined the chance of a relationship with a coworker because everyone was jealous of me. I basically couldn't handle the preening and completely snapped, called my narcissistic, jealous-lesbian, man-hating boss a bitch and walked out. Coworker/love interest now thinks I'm a complete nutcase.

You really don't understand how bad it got with them.

Used to be involved with gangs and a lot of naughty shit back in the day, I dealt with the PTSD by smoking, but I can't live a ""normal"" life stoned out of my face. I really just want a family now, but I can't handle my emotions living in a cloud 24/7.......

The thing is, I've been smoking weed every day, in a very dependent way, for the last 5 or so years. The first time I smoked was about 9 years ago, and before 2015 I smoked occasionally. Eventually, though, I became addicted. As of last week, I smoked about 4 or 5 bowls a day, though never more than that thankfully. Still, I started to depend on it in order to sleep and eat, which of course makes it pretty complicated for times in which I'm not able to smoke, such as a trip with my girlfriend's family, for instance. Abstinence during these times has resulted in some pretty unenjoyable situations. Still, if I was free and alone I would smoke whenever I could, and then read or listen to music or podcasts, or play a game, or really do anything I wanted to enjoy, or even stuff I don't enjoy.

The big problem for me began last saturday (so 7 days ago). I smoked as usual before sleeping, it had been a perfectly normal and actually excellent day, but as soon as I closed my eyes, I felt a rumble and a pain in my stomach. Now, I've been having digestive problems for a couple months now, which I ascribe to stress and the pandemic, but this time it was a painful gut wrenching sensation. I immediately panicked and thought I might have gotten a stomach virus or food poisoning, which sure enough developed into what I think was a panic attack. Chills, my body tensed up, and of course felt the gut wrenching sensation along with some nausea.  My mind associated it to the weed, and decided that I would quit it for a couple days. It wasn't the first time I quit weed for a few days or weeks (did it once last year) so I was familiar with the withdrawal symptoms. During the next few days, however, I still felt the aftershock of the panic attack, as I would get random anxiety during certain parts of the day, and fear of basically having another attack, coupled with even more stomach pain. A couple days passed and I started to calm down and feel a lot better, although I had been sleeping and eating like crap due to the withdrawal.

Stupidly, I decided to smoke again yesterday. The first time was actually enjoyable again, although still not completely normal. Like the remnants of the anxiety were still lurking behind the high, but I could actually distract myself and feel normal. At night I smoke again, but this time the ""panic attack"" happened once more. I'm happily watching a Youtube video when suddenly my stomach rumbles audibly and instant pain strikes it. This time, however, I actually didn't feel any panic. It was so out of nowhere that this rather felt like I actually did have a stomach virus or gastroenteritis of whatever. My body tenses up and I get the chills, but I'm calm, looking for these symptoms on Google. Afterwards, the pain subsides a bit and I'm able to fall asleep. A few hours later, I wake up from the stomach pain. I don't feel any anxiety though, except for the worry of whatever stomach sickness this is. I go to the bathroom, then take stomach ache drops. The pain immediately fades away and I fall asleep. The next day, (the day I write this), I take a doctor's appointment but 4 days in advance since there were no available hours for the next 4 days. Today I actually felt good (except for my stomachof course), but no anxiety, with a lot more energy and actually happy. Again I decide to smoke another bowl, but it's still not completely right. The anxiety is still there, though not as strong. I still feel a little nauseated as I'm writing this. I think that even if it's a virus or food poisoning and not related to the weed, something has broken between me and the herb. It's no longer the same as 7 days ago and the fact it was so out of nowhere and sudden shocks me. Might as well be time to quit for good.

Both substances were used daily and I was noticing the negative effects of heavy daily weed use before alcohol became a problem for me. 
I've been quarantining for 2 weeks at home and the boredom has made me think that smoking wouldn't be that bad. It was alcohol that ended me up in a detox, not weed. It was alcohol that ruined my life, not weed, right? Weed's harmless and since you don't have anything to do today, it wouldn't hurt. My brain has been telling me these things but I know they're not true. If I picked up weed today, I would get back to the level that I smoked before eventually. Weed kills my motivation, slows my brain, and eventually I get to the point that I have to smoke in order just to feel normal. It wouldn't ""ruin my life"" short-term, but benefits me in no way.
I've have never been more clear-headed in my adult life and now my addict brain is wanting me to go back to the smoke-filled muddled mess that my thoughts used to be. Also, if and when I would quit again, it would be at least a week of withdrawal hell.

I smoked my first joint at 14 and smoked sporadically through my teens (alcohol was easier to find) I’ve been smoking daily and heavily since I was 19 yrs old. Through my twenties I’d smoke an 1/8oz per day!  It has slowed down to an 1/8oz per week these days. I’ve tried most every drug under the sun and with the exception of a (thankfully) short love affair with cocaine it’s the weed that has grabbed me. I think because I’ve always justified it as “not that bad”. I have worsening asthma symptoms that I know is from weed but I still can’t stop. I’ve quit three times in as many years making it 4 months at the longest (I was getting tested at work during that period).  I have a two year old son and I’m terrified of looking back and having missed his childhood. I’m currently on day4 of sobriety and really want it to stick this time but I have to be honest that I constantly wonder what’s the point?  It hasn’t killed me yet. I function ok on it. I’ve never lost a job because of it (being self employed helps). But I know it’s muddling my brain and I’m not living life to my fullest potential. I devour addiction and sobriety books and websites for inspiration but it all makes me feel more like a loser. Like the scene from the movie Half Baked where the stoner gets booed out of the NA meeting.  I read these addiction stories and think “damn I don’t have a problem”. After I take a break I can usually moderate for a week or two but eventually it gets to the point where I’m literally smoking 3-4 back to back bowls at 5am as soon as I wake up. Every single day. And that’s just the start of my day. By evening I’m so fried from smoking all day that I’ll usually eat edibles and start in on the alcohol to “mellow” myself for the evening.  A sober friend told me about this forum so I downloaded the app and here I am. First time on Reddit and really the first time coming clean about my problems to total strangers. I think it might help. My wife is supportive of my quitting but she also asks me why and what’s the point and says “why don’t you just go smoke” when I’m cranky and irritable.  Of course she also gives me a hard time about all the money I spend on it as well. Can’t win. When I’m stoned all the time I desperately want to be sober and clearheaded and when I’m sober I desperately want to be stoned. Anyway. That’s my story.

 I have been trying to stop cannabis DEFINITELY for several months now, and even if I have made good progress, since I no longer smoke on a daily basis like last year, I still have periods sometimes, generally after to difficulties in my life, where I resume smoking daily, 3-4 joints a day, and of course, each time it completely destroys the course I had accomplished so far. One of my biggest challenges is not being tempted when a friend is smoking next to me. So of course I know the advice to get away from my smoker circle, at least initially, but I really care about one friend in particular, whom I see regularly and who is going through a difficult time. He's a lot more addicted than I am, smoking about 15 joints from morning to night. I would like to be an example for him, to motivate him.

2020-11-20 05:43:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jxmvs9/my_long_story_32m/,My long story (32M),"Hi everyone

I don't know if this fits here, because technically I didn't 'leave'.  
Quick overview: I had surgery on a herniated disc in 2012 (at 24). I found out that the only things I could do to maintain the pain was drink alcohol (not an option if you're working fulltime imho), painkillers (messed with my stomach and made me fear a Dr. House scenario) or marihuana (managed the pain, and kept me clear enough to still go to work).

So I started smoking. I had smoked a little in high school, but that would've been like 5-10 times total. At first it was one joint every evening, to make the pain bearable enough so I could sleep. That turned into 2. Then 3. And so on. I'd be aching to get home from work, stressed even, because I wanted to get high. I always smoked joints with tobacco (hi, I'm European), so two addictions nestled themselves together inside my brain. So I basically started abusing my painkiller. Something I had used for medicinal purposes became an addiction. It's a classic tale, but it's a scary one. I became 'a stoner'.

Now, I'm what most people described as a very productive stoner. I have a full-time job, several creative endeavors, a decent social circle and athletic hobbies (The hernia's - I have 10 now - made me waterfall from basketball, to running, to now yoga, cycling and hiking). However, I felt hollow. Every accomplishment at work just passed by. I would launch a new initiative, get praise, and feel absolutely nothing. Maybe some contempt and self-loathing, but no sense of pride or anything like that.

My creative work felt like a drag. I would perform well, get fist bumps and high fives from my peers, but just couldn't shake this feeling that ""I could do better"". And this feeling sucks. It made me feel like a loser, even though people around me assured me I wasn't one. But their opinion was meaningless, when my self image was so troubled. It made me unable to hold a relationship, because ""what kind of a sad woman would want to be with a loser like me?"".

In the meantime my weed intake had gone from 1 joint a day, to 4-5 joints, to a full gram each day. 2 grams on horrible days. I could always use the chronic pain as an excuse to toke up more.

Most of my friends got high too. It's an evolution that came gradually, but it come nonetheless. I no longer saw a lot of the people that knew me the longest. People that know my potential, because they saw me grow up or grew up alongside me. I was left with people - great people, don't get me wrong - who had a very 'live and let live'-attitude. It's a great way to view life, but they aren't necessarily the most motivated bunch. (and spoiler alert: I don't see many of them anymore).

So I got high all the time, and then Covid came. I was locked in the house, by myself. And I got high. A lot. Like, an unhealthy amount. I hid it from my girlfriend and my family. And I would plan meeting up with people around my weed and not the other way around. And then, the most wonderful thing ever happened: my dealer's supply dried out. So I was out of weed. And my homegrown stash had gotten mold. So I was out. And I could've found a new dealer, of course I could've. But I didn't. I just decided to not buy any weed anymore. And that went great! ...for about 3 days, until I had difficulty sleeping because of my back pain. So I found a random dealer online and bought some more. But I also asked my physical therapist to write me up a rigorous training schedule, to strengthen my back. And then the weed ran out again. And I re-upped for a gram. And then it ran out again, re-upped. And so forth. But at a certain point, I can't even tell you when, I decided to not buy any anymore. I decided to just have the pain and deal with it. It sucks. It made me realize that my reason for starting smoking was not a bad one, but my reason for continuing was laziness and addiction. I still smoke, from time to time, when someone offers (about 2 joints a month). And I'm ok with that. There's no more cravings. And clarity is returning.

I guess I wanted to give you all of this perspective, because sometimes, on this board, I have no idea how people's addiction progressed. There's a lot of 'started smoking daily at 15 and now I'm 22'-posts, which I feel very little affinity with.

The feeling I've been experiencing these last couple of months is a feeling of melancholy and nostalgia. I miss the friends I had growing up. I had some clear depression indicators growing up, that were never addressed properly. I went from abusing alcohol while studying, to abusing marihuana when grown up, to now thinking clearly for the first time in a very very long time. So... I cry a lot. I feel saddened by the fact that I missed out on a lot. My best friend growing up has a wife and kid, both of whom I've never met. People have gone through tragedies and celebrations, without me by their side. I have no idea if I was depressed or addicted. It's kind of a moot point. I just now that lately, I like the guy looking back at me in the mirror. I've given up on many of my projects and decided to just focus on a couple. I've felt more pride at work. And my relationship with both my SO and my family has improved dramatically. I'm an all-around more happy person, but I experience the sadness of life so much more. I have a lot more pain, but I manage it differently. I'm feeling optimistic and motivated about my future, whereas, I used to just 'not care'.

I guess this whole year has been weird for most of us. Some of us took a very hard look in the mirror and didn't like who we saw looking back. But it's never too late. I sent that friend with the kid and the wife a message today. And he left me on read. And you know what, that's ok. He's probably busy. Or the water between us has gotten too big. But at least I tried to bridge it.

Hang in there everyone. Writing this off my chest made me feel better. And to end with a quote of my favourite poet ""and if one kid, out of a hundred million, who are going to a struggle, feels that it relates, that's great""

Full disclosure:  my post history will reveal I used to post here pretty regularly.  Then relapse happened because ... well, relapse happens.

I have been lurking again for the past several weeks, and, damn, but I miss being a part of this community!  There is so much real here--and I really love y'all for that.

Shout-out to u/Subduction, human being and moderator extraordinnairre.  I thank you, kind sir, for helping me find the courage to expose my shame and relapse, and post again.

Will post more later.  Just wanted to dip my fingers back in the posting pie and reconnect.

I know I have a couple weeks clean, but will have to figure out how many days.  Recovery is a One Day At A Time process, and I have been stringing some clean days together.

This is the best sub on the platform and I am soooo grateful you are here.

So early in October I found this subreddit and I decided to stop smoking THC and tobacco products. I was successful and posting daily on the Reddit, but 13 days in I relapsed when I hosted a drunk karaoke party 😅 
Since then I smoked occasionally, but none like my before use. I was extra high because of the major TB. At first I would smoke every few days, but then I I got back into my old habits of smoking daily because of my roommates use. Which led to me buying again.

On top of all of this, I basically gave up on school and stopped doing my work. I was working and pretty much just blocked school out, and didn’t even wanna acknowledge the consequences. By ignoring the shit but also knowing there was a shit storm coming Mande me smoke even more to numb my self. 

So my internship ends this week and now finally I’ve decided to do something about the school situation. I emailed one of my professors basically explaining how I had personal issues going on plus work, so i didn’t do any work (since late September). I mentioned how I was willing to do all of the assignments plus any extra to make up for it. THANKFULLY she was very understanding and excited to allow me to make up my work. Also she’s my professor for 2 of my classes. I’m going to try this method if 2 of my other teachers though I think I’ll be successful with just 1.  Back to me quitting weed. This feels like a victory so I really have to tighten up and get my shit together.


Since Tuesday I’ve began listening to motivational 
talks. I figure if I do it every day I can program my brain for positive thinking. And if quitting smoking if my mission then that can be the goal I will affirm.  Also, I have a lot of internship and academic experience in Computer science and technology but without a degree it’s useless. I could get certs, but those are just stamps. The degree is the tag. I’m 22 and In a place in life where I really have to figure out my next steps. I refuse to work laborious jobs for life, so i Need to get back on my shit how I was freshman and sophomore year of college. I can get any job, but I have to really put the weed down, so I can focus because it makes me lazy as fuck. I am motivated to get myself back together because I read a lot of y’all’s posts and it made me realize we really are in this together and should be there for each other.

Over the 16 years Ive quit many many times for jobs/breaks... etc. The withdrawal gets me everytime and it was a hell run everytime. Now that I'm done and haven't looked back, I wanna share some tips for quitting and hope everyone can have an easier time. Disclaimer: Everyone is different, this is what worked for ME(hopefully for you too)

1. (First Night) I usually don't sleep (can't sleep lol) and if I do for 2-3 hours, I wake up in a pool of cold sweat. So for the first night, I do push-ups/sit-ups everytime a depressing thought or a craving kicks in. Drink water > take a piss > drink more water > take more piss. Music, anything that you like, try not to listen to emotional love songs tho lol. I recommend Two steps from hell.
2. (First week) Hell week, pretty much First night feeling for a whole week. Again, every time your brain send you a negative thought or cravings, DO PHYSICAL TRAINING! Higher intensity is better, even if you drop after 5 push ups, do them super fast. And water water water, even if you hate it. Down that bottle.
3. Talk a friend or anyone that understands what's going on. (Post here if you have no one to talk to)  

Weed can be beneficial if you can have a set schedule and balance it out. After all, too much of anything can be harmful. Good luck and NEVER give up!",0,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.982727587223053}"

I made this rationalization with myself ""You have done well the last 12 days, let's celebrate and go pick up some weed tomorrow.""

So I sat down to unwind and watched some Breaking Bad. In this episode, one of the characters said ""The things you do have an impact on other people."" I felt really... uneasy. It resonated and it hit *hard*. I can't explain it, but I got nervous.

This might be silly, but I did a Tarot reading for myself. I asked what my journey would be like if I went through with it and got myself weed. The reading warned of depression, uncertainty. But the last card stuck with me: inverted Ace of Wands. For this deck that meant wasted talent. Ouch...

Then I did a second reading. What would happen if I *didn't* go. The card that stuck out was an inverted ""Tower"", meaning that I had an opportunity to avoid disaster. The card right after that was Knight of Swords: ambition and driven to succeed.

It was settled, I am not going.

Now look, I am not one of those guys who reads the stars or reads daily horoscopes... but this worked. The craving vanished out of thin air, gone. Honestly, I think my conscience knew all along what it wanted and read into it what it wanted. Fucking fair enough, because it saved my sobriety.

I am damn proud of myself for that, I am getting a bit misty-eyed sharing this (even if the process was unorthodox).

Some history: I am now 30 and I started smoking at 14. I loved it immediately- much like every other drug I have ingested. Acute habits to opiates, alcohol, cocaine, benzos, and amphetamines are included in that list. I was able to quit weed for 3-4 years while I was on probation to avoid breaking my terms, but was using alcohol periodically throughout that time while going on week long binges of uppers, that would leave my system quit enough or I could mask with some shady \~science\~. 

I have managed to quit all of these other habits since getting off of probation some 4-5 years ago, but weed now stands alone now as my one vice and it is absolutely hampering my cognitive abilities, depleting my bank account, and derailing my goals.  

Although I have a decent full-time job in education and am halfway through an MBA program, my motivation is shot and although I feel driven to accomplish my goals, I rarely put in the effort needed to really make the change I want to see in the world. 

I am sick of having no self control and acting impulsively. I know my brain demands more when it gets a taste of something it likes, it it demands my attention. 

Excited to have this community in my corner as I look to get this monkey off my back, and please know you are not alone but you are stronger than this substance. 

Take it one day at a time.

Remember your thoughts do ~~not~~ have to turn to actions.

Now since the events of this year started to unfold and the shit show started , I found that getting high has only sent me into a wave of extreme anxiety , overthinking and paranoia. The times I did get High this year, I’d go into deep thinking about the the state of the world, like the pandemic, the riots and protests, the new way of life, and everything else that has made 2020 a disaster. When things were normal, weed was enjoyable and there wasn’t too much extreme events that gave me anxiety to begin with, I mean not any events like this year . 

I never thought I’d stop getting high. Part of wants to smoke again, but I know it’ll only give me more dark highs, and send me into a hellhole spiral of extreme anxiety while high.  The 2020 conspiracy theories about new world order and all that other shit has definitely not helped one bit and actually has made me want to stay sober even more.

Like lots of you, I'm trying to quit using cannabis, with reddit being like a motivational tool for me. 

Unlike most of this posts in this tread I feel like it's necessary to bring some positive news about quitting weed.

For the last 7 years I've been smoking weed day in day out. As I went to college I felt like it was commonly accepted en never had any issues/problems buying/using it.

Now for the last months I'm experiencing severe anxiety and dependency throughout the day. Naturally I'm a very extravert person who loves socializing, making new friends, things that aren't really associated with potsmokers... Nevertheless last months I felt like I wasn't living up to my full potential and I might be disappointing my parents, family and friends. 

As this has build op throughout last months I really felt like it was time for change, so I did. 6 days ago I threw everything down the toilet and gave away all my weed accesories. 

The next 3 days were really difficult => no sleep, no appetite, no excitement, feeling like a total loser junkie. (bet you all know the feeling) 

This all sounds quite depressing but after the first 3-4 days I started to feel like a new person. Sleep is still terrible and probably will be for the next couple of weeks but my mental awareness, happiness don't weigh up against those disadvantages.

Most of my cravings/disconforts are becoming easier and easier to cope with every day. Today, day 6 of withdrawal I visited my best mates and they were really positive, telling me I walk and talk like a different person. For me personal these are the biggest advantages since I've made the decision to quit smoking pot:

- Enhanced mood
- Appetite
- I'm glowing, starting to have some color
- Expanding vocabulary 
- Socially very strong
- Indepency
- Mind and body are finally fitting together 
-... 

As I'm Belgian my native languages are Dutch and French, this might explain some errors I made regarding grammar/vocabulary. 

Nevertheless, my message should be quite clear: hang in there and you will recognize quitting MJ is the best decision you've ever made.

(When I was stoned, I regularly slept 8-12 hours a night (usually 10+) for comparison. I also took naps frequently.)

The worst part about all of this is I am homeless and living in my car in a cold climate. The last 2 nights were in the teens and I woke up and could not go back to sleep. Today I took melatonin and slept most of the day, so I could at least be warm while sleeping. I should be working (delivery services) but I just can’t bring myself to clean my car out enough to do it. I’m still tired now, so I’m probably going to go back to sleep again.

Does anyone have timeframes on when the exhaustion ends? I feel like I’m at the end of my rope. I am contemplating going to a mental hospital just to be able to sleep, but I am resisting because I can’t stand most psych nurses (very abusive). Yes, I have extreme mental illness on top of all this.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992775321006775}"

Our smoking is very much habitual and tied to our routine:
On weekdays, sometimes but more often than not, we will smoke at 5pm, after work. 
Another straight after dinner 7 or 8pm
and once more before bed at 10 or 11pm. 
Weekends are similar with the addition of 1 after breakfast and another after or even either side of lunch.
All of these are usually enjoyed in the comfort of a table/sofa/bed accompanied with the latest series/YT reccomendation.

(Sorry if this is long just want to share my progress) TL;DR at the bottom

What **has** changed:

* Physical Health
   * No longer eating 2000+ Calories every night past 10 pm
   * Started tracking my calories/macros each day and making sure I eat enough/don't eat too much
   * Eating full complete meals, with multiple healthy snacks throughout the day
   * Started working out again and I picked up a 6 day split
   * Lost around 10 pounds!!! Something I am so excited about, but still have ways to go!
   * No more pain in my lungs/trouble breathing after walking up a flight of stairs
   * Wake up most mornings feeling like I actually got sleep the night before
   * Don't have a lingering head/lung cold
* Mental Health
   * No longer depressed/anxious every single day
      * Still have lingering signs of depression and anxiety but they are no where close to as severe as they used to be
   * No more suicidal thoughts every single night before going to bed or each morning when I wake up
   * I am starting to feel more confident in myself
      * I am able to share in class without overthinking everything I say, I am also able to share during my MA meetings without feeling an overwhelming sense of anxiety
   * I can be pretty emotional at times, this can be good or bad but basically all the emotions that I suppressed using weed never left they were just tucked away. 
* Hobbies/Habits
   * I started meal prepping/Cooking multiple times a week
   * My dental hygiene has gotten much better
      * I brush my teeth multiple times a day, and no longer stuff my face with junk food after brushing at night
   * I make sure my room is clean at all times, and don't let things pile up
   * MEDITATE DAILY
      * Highly recommend this. Without going into it too much, I started each morning and night for one minute a session and moved forward from there. I find it so beneficial.
   * A little bit more organized with my schoolwork, still not where I want to be at though.

What **has not** changed: (I feel like this is necessary cause not everything is butterflies and rainbows.)

* I still experience cravings/desires for weed near daily. The only **difference** is I now have the tools and proper desire to manage it. 
* My cravings have expanded beyond weed but to prior drugs I used to abuse. Seems like I am trying to fill a void that has opened up since quitting weed.
   * Again, I am now able to **manage** these cravings through proper tools and practices that I utilize.
* I still procrastinate like crazy with my schoolwork
* I have cravings for snacks late night, but at least I am able to control them now.

TL;DR

My life has **changed for the better**. However, not all of this has changed because I quit smoking weed. This may sound tough but it was up to me in order to change the things I did. Not smoking weed didn't magically change my life in one day. 

A good analogy to understand this is think about driving a SUV everyday and each day you throw all your trash into backseat. Then one day you decide to stop and slam on the brakes. All that trash comes flying forward hitting you, and you must learn how to deal with it. All that trash is your emotions and life issues that you threw into the back seat with weed. Now you must learn how to deal with it in effective manner, one little bit at a time.

 I don't mean for this to discourage anyone. If you are on this subreddit looking through these posts you have already made great progress by understanding that you **may be an addict and weed has made your life unmanageable.** While quitting weed is definitely a step in the right direction, it is up to you at the end of the day to change your life for the better.

This has been the longest time off the stuff. The hardest thing for me was to change my attitude during everyday activities. I've noticed that I would light up prior to pretty much ""any"" activity with family or friends to get myself to enjoy anything. Being a regular cannabis user for the past 7 years I thought it was a way to cope with everyday life (it made everything just better). Fortunately having a clear mind for once I can honestly say that it actually pushed most of my issues aside and I neglected to deal with them. Now that I'm older I can only imagine what opportunities I have missed out on and the people I have let down but most importantly myself. 

I found out the other day that Nov 19 is a day for people across the nation to also quit smoking cigarettes, I want to do that as well. The strange thing is I have an urge to also stop drinking. I've noticed my alcohol consumption has increased since I stopped smoking weed. I now have learned what I have is an addictive personality. I want to be 100% sober because this is something that I want to do to make myself a better person for me. Not for anyone else because all these years I've been mentally pushing myself aside. 

I've noticed that I am also less defensive over all and less pensive. I feel like I am connecting more with life and people in general. I forgot what it was like to be sober and I think this is my new addiction. This is the only addiction that I want. I don't want to slip again or anymore. I enjoy feeling my feelings and I enjoy this clarity of mind. I know I can't go back and fix the relationships that I have ruined but I know that I can move forward. I know I can love myself and start taking care of myself the way I thought I needed to take care of other people. I no longer want to smoke to feel happy or any of the other reasons why I thought smoking was a benefit to me. I hope I can come back to this post in another five days and eventually my goal being a year and help others the way r/eaves has helped me. Reading the messages of others have really gave me hope so thank you r/leaves.

I've been keeping track of every day that I make it, and every day that I slip. I managed to not smoke for 41 of the 60 days.  But it was really exhausting. Every time I would slip, I would have to go through the entire process of quitting again. Restarting day 1 over and over. I really want to quit entirely. Looking back at the days that I managed to not smoke, it is clear that I'm having a lot of trouble around the 7 to 10 day mark. I just can't seem to push past that. In my head, when I'm about to slip, I rationalize to myself that I'm really stressed and I need to relax my mind in order to think more clearly. I'm having trouble dropping that limiting belief so that I can quit entirely. Does anyone have any advice on how I can keep pushing longer?

I think another one of my challenges is relaxation. Although I try different methods, I feel like they don't help. At least, not nearly to the extend that weed relaxes. I wish I could find a good solution to replace marijuana with a different relaxing activity. Maybe I just haven't found the right method yet. Or maybe I have found the right method, I just haven't been able to follow through with it every day. A few methods that I've tried are:

* Mindfulness meditation - I think this kind of relaxes me, but also I feel like I'm burning a lot of self discipline just to sit there and try to clear my mind. I keep winding back up at this solution, but I just haven't been able to make it work yet. It's just not enjoyable. And in some cases, it makes me even more stressed after, since I just forced myself to sit and do nothing for 20 minutes.
* Accupressure mat + aromatherapy + relaxing music - I think this has helped in the past. I enjoy relaxing back on my accupressure mat. But I don't think I've ever done this for longer than 3 days in a row. And then I just stop. Or forget about it
* Walking around the park - It's about a 30 minute walk. I think it could be relaxing, although usually when I walk around the park, I listen to music. And my mind usually wanders as I walk, which almost always leads to rumination or negative self talk about whatever is going on in my life at that moment. Usually I find that by the time I get back from my walk, I am no more relaxed than when I started. Maybe one possible solution would be to listen to an uplifting audiobook. But then, listening to an audiobook feels like ""work"" and then I feel like I'm burning self discipline. I think when I'm actually going for a walk and listening to an audiobook, it can be enjoyable. But I never look forward to it.

(+ A little backstory on my addiction),"So for the beginning half of my consumption of weed I would only smoke at nights. Once I got a stoner girlfriend, some stoner friends, and started hanging around my stoner gf's family (all HEAVY smokers) I got out of control and smoked all day everyday.

We eventually broke up; but I was still smoking all day everyday by myself. Even though I was still smoking, I cut off all my stoner friends because most of the time I was smoking (5 years so far) I've wanted to quit for like 4 years of it. I've always known this was an addiction for the most part. It only helped in the beginning.

Anyways now I've managed to cut down to just one roach a night. My dad is a stoner and I live with him right now and that's where I get my weed. And I'm not making enough money to move out, nor do I want to because I'm happy with our home and my dad is actually a really great person. Plus I'm 18 yrs old and don't even have a vehicle yet or much anything; I'm still trying to get on my feet. It's just a bit of a challenge that he happens to smoke at night, so the source is always readily available just 10 steps out of my room.

But the thing that keeps me coming back to weed night after night is the fact that I COMPLETELY depend on it to get to sleep.

Without weed I will lay miserable and bored in bed for hours upon hours and get maybe a good 3hrs worth of sleep a night. I was at a rehab for a pill addiction and man, without weed, even after a month I still was getting 3-5 hrs sleep a night and it was miserable.

I even take a sleeping pill, but if I don't smoke with it, the sleeping pill will not do jack shit to get me to sleep. Even melatonin dosen't work. Benadryl. I've tried it all.

And I don't have the motivation to try to meditate or something before bed because once I get off work doing 2nd shift I don't really feel like doing anything but smoking and eating food.

It feels like I'm trapped and I'll never get out of this maze.

What do I do?

Can someone please give solid advice on how to fall asleep without weed? It feels almost impossible. Not to mention I'm also on an antidepressant medication that is known to cause insomnia which does not help my case at all. Especially because I've dealt with insomnia since a young child. But this medication helps me so much that the benefits far outweigh negatives. So I'm confused and stuck.

Clarification: This is something I wrote 12 days ago but for various reasons I couldn't post it then. I hope there are some nuggets here that might help you on your path.

\---

**Background**  
I've been thinking about writing a longer post here for some time to share my experience in this challenge, and today I'm turning 30 so I feel that this is the perfect moment to write this, especially since I broke my own promise I made about 5 months ago.

I've been using, and what later on became abuse, this substance daily for about 9 years. I was doing very well in life: I was young, had a great job, great flat, nice car, good relationship with family and friends. Every day I came home from whatever I was doing, I made sure to give myself the gift of soothing when coming home. Almost all of the days were the same cycle containing the same things, in different orders, only thing I made sure of was to be high when doing these things: eating restaurant food, playing video games, hanging out with same group of friends, eating munchies, lazily making music, watching porn and masturbating, watching movies. I had a very expensive bed that was never used. I would do these things until 3-4 in the night, wake up from my alarm at 8 in my couch, TV still on, mouth dry from no water and too much sugar, still stoned, stressed to get dressed and brush my teeth and go to work. 

**The start of my journey**  
Eventually last year, I started realising that I have a problem. I met a guy in a club, we started talking about pot in general and he said something that stuck with me: ""*Embrace your addictions*"". Yes, this sounds so strange to hear and at first glance it is basically like he was telling me to indulge and not care about the consequences, but that is not how he explained it afterwards. The reason you are smoking is because you love it, or did love it. Now it has become this compulsion where you have to smoke even though you don't love the feeling you get from it. I could come home very late, drunk from a night out, starting to roll one while almost passing out, knowing it will just make me sick like it had done so many times before, but: ""No!! I have to smoke this before I go to bed!"" After two puffs, everything started spinning and I would go to my bed, pass out without brushing my teeth or getting changed. After hearing his discourse on that specific phrase, I stopped with all the super-compulsory smokes. This is where things really started for me, where I started asking yourself what the reason for using it was.

**Noticing triggers and compulsion**   
I realised that I had this compulsion which is an action that is not out of love anymore, and that set me off in a very clear direction as I started recognising more and more of the unnecessary joints. Then, about 5 months ago I promised myself that I would give myself an amazing gift for my 30th birthday: The gift of having been sober for 5 months. It went well in the beginning, life was going well, I had pot at home but didn't even touch it because I didn't want to. Friends offered while they were smoking and I was able to say ""No thank you, but you enjoy please"". Just that feeling of saying no, because you know it is not helping you, is incredible. This held for 2,5 months. Then, because of different triggers and also seeing other people smoke without any problems, I relapsed. ""How much can it hurt, fuck it, we only live one life it is not that bad, everyone else is doing it"". Boom, right back into the spiral that took me further down. As I was starting to pick myself up again and was sober for a time, I got caught again, this time when I met a girl who was sexually very wild, and also liked smoking weed. I've had some great experiences with sex and weed with previous partners, so I was triggered by my desire to replicate those experiences with her: It didn't work. Replicating something NEVER works since you never have the same experience twice.

I came clean, told her that I have trouble with weed and that it doesn't work for me. I need time to heal. We broke it off, I felt like shit, wanted to smoke but I resisted, and now I've been sober for two weeks and I am already feeling like the universe is starting to send me gifts.

**The universe always sends you challenges, and looks very carefully to see if you can handle the challenge.** If not, you get another round of the same challenge, in a different dress, in the future. If you handled it: Good! The universe acknowledges this, and sends you a gift. But the gift is something that you will be happy about, but it comes with the next level of challenge for you too. Everything that we are supposed to do in this life is to learn from our challenges and build our strength. Get yourself to the next level, and look for the challenges in everything and make yourself a better person.

Here are some ideas that have been very helpful for me during this period.

&#x200B;

**I'm addicted to my irresponsibility**  
I'm not addicted to the substance itself, I don't believe that one can get addicted to the substance but I am addicted to the irresponsibility I feel when I'm stoned. I've taught myself that whenever I am high, I don't have to be productive. I don't have to answer peoples phone calls, I don't have to eat healthy food. I'm basically indulging in carelessness, and that is what most children do. Therefore, maybe one might try...

**There is no use in being angry with a child that does not understand better**  
The part of you that wants to be irresponsible and just smoke all day without caring about anything is there, and always will be. We have to teach it. Think about this scenario for a moment: A 3-year old child is playing with a toy, throws it on the ground, you pick it up and give it to the child. It plays with it for a couple of seconds, and then again, throws it on the ground. You pick it up again. No matter how many times this happens, you will probably not get to a point where you get angry at the child. Why? It does not know better! We have to teach it with patience, how to behave, what is right and wrong in life, and when the child gets older explain that everything has consequences. Don't be angry at your inner child for wanting to indulge, it doesn't know better. I've started having friendly conversations with the 13 year old me, imagining myself giving it a high-five and seeing it for what it is rather than neglecting it and offending it. It is just a child who is just interested in indulging and not caring about consequences. Whenever I hear a thought saying that it just wants to be reckless and smoke and do the same old cycle, I answer with a mental smile in the kindest way possible: ""Oh, I totally understand that you want to do that. But the consequences of that is not something we can handle unfortunately. Isn't it better to be productive, and achieve what you want to achieve? Remember when you make music without doubting yourself? Or when you actually remember what you read? Yeah, you see, those are the things that you gain from not indulging in something that gives you pleasure for a short moment. It is OK that you want the pleasure though, I feel you, but it is not possible. Thank you for understanding."" 

**The hangover from smoking**  
Everyone talks about the hangover from drinking alcohol, or other substances, but basically no one actually talks about the hangover from smoking pot. For me, I've realised now that it takes me days, even weeks, to get back from just one night of smoking. Brain fog, stuttering when talking, tiredness, demotivation, constantly catching myself in psychological time (thinking about events in the past or future). You probably already know, but it is good to realise that it takes longer time with pot, because it latches onto your body in a different way. 

**Don't blame the substance**  
The substance itself is not a bad thing. It is a medicinal plant, so appreciate that you have had the possibility to take part of it and gain something from it. If you didn't gain anything from it in the beginning it wouldn't have become a pattern that you repeated. No creature will ever indulge and keep doing something that it immediately feels is not giving them something. But abusing something that is good for you will eventually turn into something that is working against you.

**Counting days is a risk**  
Be careful when counting days as it has the potential to make it worse if you eventually relapse. I have started applying this to everything (caffeine, sugar, PMO, etc.) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jj85k5/so_have_some_sober_time_behind_you_but_you_just/) by [u/PotIsntAddict-ohcrap](https://www.reddit.com/user/PotIsntAddict-ohcrap/) (thank you, and amazing name haha) was just an incredible analogy for this whole idea. Just because you relapsed once, doesn't mean that you lose all the progress you have done. Take it day by day, focus on keeping yourself occupied today.

**Don't ask for advice, ask for presence from friends/family**  
This addiction has been a topic for me for such a long time now. I've talked about my issue with friends and family, told them how bad it is for me and how I my life changes in the most positive ways when I'm sober. They see the aliveness and progress in me when I don't use, and are always happy for me. But then I get triggered by something, or someone, or something bad happens (break up, bad result on exam, a day where things do not go as well as you hoped etc.) and I fall back into it. When I tell them this, they get frustrated. ""You know it is bad for you, why do you keep doing that"", ""Can't you try doing this or that"". Bam, right in the gut. The feeling of shame. Why am I so fucking useless? I feel like a bad person now, what can I do to feel better? Oh yeah, I can smoke because my brain automatically knows that it has worked before. All of a sudden, you are in the vicious cycle. **When talking to friends and family about this issue, just let them know that you don't need their advice or words because you already know how bad it is for you, otherwise you wouldn't bring it up. Tell them that what you need from them is their presence. You just need them to listen and not judge you.**

**Comparing yourself to people is like shooting yourself in the foot**  
Comparing yourself to other people is not really OK in any sense in this world. I keep hearing and seeing people who use the substance but still manage to be successful and happy with themselves. What you don't really see is that they might be have the same issue you are having with this substance, with some other substance. Every relationship (or addiction) to a certain substance is unique, because you have conditioned your mind to associate this substance with certain things. I have, through years of laziness, unhealthy eating and time wasting, taught my brain to associate smoking pot with these things. 

**The technique of A/B-ing and making the best decisions**  
As human beings we perceive and understand reality by contrasts. I am a musician, and there is something producers apply to sound: A/B-ing. Basically, you have a sound that is dry (no effects), and then you add an effect to it. Hmm, okay it sounds like this now. Then you turn the effect off, to hear how the sound is without the effect again. You continue to **listen to the differences** by turning the effect on/off to understand how the sound is affected. Aren't you curious to see how your life will look without the effect of this substance? Maybe you can give yourself a shot at making a good decision by knowing how your life looks with it, and how it looks without it. 

**You are not too late**  
Accept that you have been in this spiral of abuse for a long time, but also that it could've been longer. There is no need for saying: ""I wish I would've stopped earlier, I wasted my 20s with this bla bla bla"". You are early already, what if you got to this point that you are today, in 15 years instead? Or never would get there at all? Be happy that you have come to this insight NOW: There is no sense in crying over spilt milk.

**Imagination is the key to success**  
I work a lot with manifestation and my own imagination, and I believe you basically mind fuck (or program, for a gentler word) your mind into certain things. If you imagine the feeling of something, your spirit will work harder to make that feeling a reality. Something that has been working for me is to do this: Imagine the feeling of pride you feel when saying: ""No thank you"" when someone is offering you a puff. Or the feeling of not having anything to hide when around people who would judge you for being stoned. Or that feeling of aliveness and freshness of your lungs. These are some of my techniques but I'm sure you'd have maybe similar, but for certain your own reasons to what makes you feel good about not using. The more I imagine these feelings, the more likely I am to actually get them in the future. 

**Meditation, training your mental strength**  
Meditation is, IMHO, a major key to life that will help you recognise your own thought patterns. With meditation you basically teach/train yourself to be aware of what is going on in your mind. The more you do this, the better you get at it. If you feel like meditation is tough, that you have tried it but ""damn I can never get my mind to shut up"", I'll give you this nugget: The purpose of meditation is not to ""sit down and have a silent mind"", the mind is doing exactly its job: To throw you ideas. A meditation practice is to encourage and enforce your ability to discard an uncomfortable thought without escaping through any other experiences (such as looking at something else, browsing your phone etc.). When you sit for a 10 minute meditation, you train yourself to handle all your inner turmoil with **only** the power of your brain for ten minutes. 

**Don't be too harsh on yourself**  
You are human, and we have our weaknesses. Give yourself a pat on the back because you are still trying. You are here and have come this far, you have come to these insights and are on your journey to be able to walk away from this for good. You are doing well, give yourself a high-five. Addiction is one of the biggest hurdles in life for many people. What you are attempting right now is to rewire your brain and it takes time, so give yourself props for the effort!

**Last of all, my personal letter to MJ**  
Hi love, 

Thank you. Thank you for all the good times we've had together, and for you being there for me when I needed someone. I've learned so much from you, but this relationship is not working for me anymore. Thank you for staying by my side but I have to move on to experience new things now. I can't let you hold me back as I want to explore the world, and unfortunately I can't do that with you by my side. We will meet again, but as friends and not lovers. I know you will be all around me in the future, and that you will just be one ""Yes"" away at certain times, but you are not for me anymore. Thank you.

Best,

Firstly, I would just like to say that I appreciate every one of you guys who are a part of this group and I have been following the posts here for a good few months now and it has certainly helped me in many ways.

Okay so a bit about me- 

I am a 26YO/M, who has been smoking every day without fail, the only times I wouldn't be smoking for a prolonged time would be if I was travelling on a flight or have family over (I would flake out of these situations as much as I can just to get that quick smoke in anyway lol). But yeah, lets get into a bit of a backdrop of WHY I smoked, and HOW I stayed strong in the process of limiting and then eventually quitting.  

Around the age of 21, I think it was the first time in my life where I had really started experiencing life. I had experienced loss in which I lost a few dear ones in my life, also my dream career was looking like something unachievable at the time which took away much of my direction and confidence. I started to smoke for reasons which I deemed as 'spiritual reasons' at the time. I used to smoke for meditative purposes, I would exercise, do yoga, fuck, eat, do everything whilst high. 

As I started increasing the amounts and building up my tolerance, the high didn't feel as good as it once did when I first started, it became more of a ritual, combined with the addiction of it all. Anger, mood swings, restlessness, anxiety kicking in, I would literally run back home from in excitement just to blaze up wit the boizzzz. 

A few years ago, I had started working in and around the 'weed scene', which further made things hard for me, I enjoyed the lifestyle, especially as its a scene that's taking off more and more here in the UK, despite its illegality and I guess I enjoyed the thrill of things. I was constantly around the smoke, so if I wasn't smoking, I was deffo 2nd hand smoking from all the fumes around me. 

I started having my first doubts at weed last year where I started realising how much time I was actually wasting getting high, especially with people that don't necessarily have my back or people that I aspire to be around, I guess weed lowered my 'standards' as I started losing my own self-esteem. I realised I would only hang around with stoners and feel confident just with stoners like myself. I would avoid non-stoners as I would think that they can't relate to me, or they would be less fun - but this is where it got dangerous for me. I started becoming more distant from my family, i was avoiding, also I would spend less time with the girls I was dating throughout my stoner days which took a toll on many of my relationships, many girls absolutely hating the fact that I smoked the amounts I was smoking. 

Long story short, i smoked for these reasons - to feel high during my lowest points, to numb my work pressures, and to make sex feel better. 

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!! I became reliant on weed before having sex which isn't very smart! I will explain later lol...

I quit once before but it didn't last very long, reason being - I didn't remind myself of why i water to quit or appreciate the benefits that sobriety brings to me. I think if one really wants to quit, they must really want to and have something or some passion waiting for you on the other side, whether it is a healthier state you want to be in, a new job you want to apply for, your relationships with your loved ones. Personally, I didn't want to spend another day avoiding my family who I love so dearly, it used to break my heart knowing that I have argued, avoided, lied, cheated ALL in the name of weed. 

I am certainly not anti-weed or anything, its a plant with great medicinal powers and can deffo help many people in their own ways, but it just isn't for me anymore. I wasn't a user, I was an ABUSER!! Rather than getting that nice high, I started getting paranoia, confidence levels went down, became reliant on it during sex so if I wasn't high I would be avoiding sex which would be very stupid. 

on October 1st, that was the day I started my quest in quitting. From then till now, I had one slip up! On October the 14th, I went on holiday to Lanzarote with my lovely GF who I have been with for a few years now, I had a smoke at one of the weed cafes in celebration of landing myself a new property (I managed to get into real estate). I enjoyed the high for like 10 mins until the paranoia kicked in, anxiety and then general fogginess. Before this I was 14 days sober so I slipped up and undone some of the hard work. HOWEVER, when i look back at that slip up I am glad I had it. It reminded me of why I wanted to quit and how crap the high has become for me. That one celebration joint made me DETERMINED ASF to keep sober. 

Okay so now the ugly parts of quitting and my withdrawals:

weeks 1-3 : Insomnia, belly aches, intense mood swings, lack of appetite, sharp headaches, night sweats, unbearable hot flashes that kept me tossing and turning allllllll night.

around weeks 3-5 : better sleep, weird kidney pain/cramps/ still the occasional mood swings (usually morning). still night sweats (not as intense), same with hot flashes.

I am around 7 weeks sober ( minus that 1 holiday spliff). I now have 0 cravings. The quality of my sleep could be better. I am now enjoying my new career path and as daunting as it is, i wouldn't be able to face any of the challenges I am facing today with weed. Can only live the life I want in a Sober state.

My friends, you got this. YOU deserve a better version of yourself and so do your loved ones! Feel free to get in contact with me, would love to help if I can in any way and can give you guys more details if required when it comes to my withdrawals!

Then I started working and that was what I did. I smoked. Every day. I would rationalize it. Like it’s not alcohol. I can smoke at 6 in the morning and still function the rest of the day. If I smoked once in a day I would smoke multiple times. The longest break I took was almost 3months and I don’t know why I went back to it but I did. 7days sober, going on 8. Day 4 and 5 were the hardest. I don’t want to feel that way again. Every day I add a day to my sobriety and it feels good. I look forward to changing that number on my white board. Like others have said I raeally smelled. The weed just oozes out of you and you don’t notice when you’re smoking but it stinks. Your body odor smells. The second hand smoke smells. My advice to those who are trying to quit. Don’t rationalize your habit. If you can try to quit when you can sleep in the next couple of days. That really helped me every time I’ve “quit” which was quite often recently, I’d “quit” for a few days and then rationalize it to myself after a hard day of work or school. Get past that first week and things will get better. I started smoking sociably and as I got older the social circle went away and I just smoked because it made me feel good.

I've been wanting to quit for sometime now but convinced myself since I wasn't technically smoking plant material, that the pure sap vapors were pure medicine since I personally grew it and knew it contained no pesticides, grown in awesome soil blah blah fucking blah. 

Then one day my brother comes over and I torch the rig up, swirl it up and hear him utter, ""dope fiend"" under his breath. He was right. I was cracked out.

I was serving it, as if it was a spiritual entity that lived through my connection to it.

I don't drink, do any other drugs, haven't eaten meat in 5 years if that even means anything, take hella other herbs and would exercise more if I didn't live in a neighborhood where gunshots don't make you flinch.

I started smoking marijuana about 5 years ago. I started smoking everyday during this five years. Personally, I have always enjoyed the high, and have had some great times doing it. It was only until a few months ago, after doing some live resin where I had my first panic attack. It was an intense attack, but i was able to be aware and focus my mind to some degree. I took a break for a few days and then tried to start smoking again (just herb and a bong). Unfortunately, I ended up having another panic attack, this one was much worse. Almost, like a really bad lsd trip. That night i ended up on youtube listening to a lady telling me to think happy thoughts lol, it was not good. So i took a break for a few days, and I could build up tolerance sometimes, but most of the time now when i try to smoke i begin to shake, sometimes very uncontrollable, this becomes a fine line between shaking and another panic attack, also a real sweaty feeling in my hands and feet. With this, comes a strong sense of nervousness, and uncertainty. So now i told myself it was time to stop since i was not experiencing the past enjoyment of marijuana that i had once experienced in my previous years. Inevitably, it was time to quit. So I have quit for almost a month and a half now, cold turkey. But now I live with this strong feeling of anxiety and uncertainty that was never there before. I believe what i am experiencing is marijuana withdrawals symptoms, and even a disconnect from the mind and body, this is all self-diagnosed. Sometimes I weirdly can't feel my toes, even though my toes are clearly there. Along with this, I have had nightmares every night since quitting, which I read is common. I am curious to know if anyone has had a similar experience given what I have shared. I read it takes 4-8 weeks for the symptoms typically to run its course, for me it has been around the 8 week mark but not much relief, today in fact felt the worst. My goal is to get back to my normal self, and find a way to cope with this new anxiety, as well as scattered thoughts. What I am looking for is any insight/advice or perhaps medication recommendation that might be suited for my situation. Thanks!",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9924213290214539}"

So I use to be a daily smoker years ago, I quit and haven’t smoked in over 5 years. And 3-4 weeks ago I decided I’d like to smoke one night I live in CA so I went to the dispensary and bought a disposable vape pen. I’ve ended up enjoying it a lot and continued to use and bought a couple more .5gram disposable vapes and would use 2-3x daily for the last 3-4 weeks.  I decided it was time to stop I had my fun but was being to lazy and unmotivated. So Sunday night the last vape was empty and I was going to quit. 

As I’m trying to go to bed I’m getting hot and cold sweats, chills, I’m slightly irritated, and maybe slept 1 hour that whole night woke up for work Monday feeling super emotional, just general feeling of being overwhelmed I almost called in sick. I was thinking I had the flu. Then I remembered years ago when I smoked daily and I’d run out I’d have issues sleeping. But never the sweats or this level of emotional side effects. So I found this group and did some reading on thc withdrawals and learned this can be common. 

So after all that I guess my question is I’ve only been using daily for maybe 4 weeks it seems my withdrawal symptoms shouldn’t be this severe?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9946597218513489}"

My last time sober was around june-jully 2019. On it for five years then. Got a job, changed some things about my life but still, i feel stuck and ashamed of myself. I got back into using telling myself it was fine, i deserved it after working hard. That i could just use less. When covid hit, doing home office high became the norm.

There is one thing, though, that i can say with pride! I am 20 days nicotine free. Buuuut my weed consumption has skyrocketed. Smoked around 30g this last week, and **i can't get high.**

I alreasy started doing a lot of healthy stuff this last month (eating leafs, walking an hour a day) but i still feel anxious, fucking depressed, underachieving. I can't get personal work done due to anxiety and fear of feailure. Then what do i do? Smoke. For some time i've been daydreaming about getting a motorcycle and traveling, and after boss gave me a raise i started putting some money away. I live n the third world with a lower-middle class salary, so for a cheap but new one i'll need to save an entire year or even more. Pen on the paper (google sheets, actually), quitting pot could help me buy it a few months earlier, and the pot money for next year could be spent on two months on the road. 

Then i think about being sober, and i feel so lonely. I don't know if loneliness was what got me into weed to begin with. I'd have to be by myself, dealing with this boring person. ""oh call your friends"". it's hard when their stuff is now out of your league, or they are still in that teen head. Even when i'm with people i feel like i can't connect.  


Thanks for the attention. I'll try to do it. I think doing both nicotine and weed in a short period of time may be overbearing but maybe a boot camp is what i need.

I feel like quitting is the right answer and I dont know how to do it. I chase dopamine. So I naturally struggle with trying to do anything that makes me feel good, whether its porn, video games, gambling, etc. These arent excessive problems but they still exist.

I don't know if it's marijuana is making it worse or bettee or neither, but, and I know this may sound crazy, but I feel like if I quit pot, I'll just run to something else.

Before I started smoking weed, I’d just drink at the bar a couple times a week. I’d almost never go there two days in a row. After a while of going to the bar, the weed vape pens started becoming popular. Somebody let me try it and I really loved the effects of it.

I did some research on weed and a number of sites, graphs and people online said that it was less addictive and harmful for you than alcohol. So I figured I’d have a go at it and buy some. I was wrong to believe them. What they said did not turn out to be true, at least for me.

I bought an eight from a dealer. I figured no big deal, I’ll just smoke a little bit every once in a while... nope. I smoked it every day until I finally ran out of it. I kept doing it every day, sometimes staying high for 6-7 hours a day. The first day it was great. After that, I got a bunch of paranoia and anxiety. I was burnt out constantly and I could hardly remember anything.

When I finally ran out of it, I was relieved. It no longer had a vice-grip on me. And to my luck, the dealer ghosted me. I knew no-one to buy it from, I was free at last. Fast forward a number of months and then Delta-8 THC is made legal by the farm Bill. People say it’s even less addictive than the “regular weed” which is Delta-9. I have no idea what I was thinking, but I decide to buy some.

I buy a tincture bottle, 1,500mg of D8 and a vape cart with 500mg in it. The tincture bottle lasts much longer than smoking, now allowing me to stay high all-day long instead of 5-7 hours. A month later I run out. That was 4 days ago now. And I’ve been withdrawing for the last 4 days. It sucks. I’ve had mild nausea throughout the day, anxiety and trouble sleeping.

The first day of withdrawing I got no sleep whatsoever. Since then I’ve been getting about 3 hours a day. First day my anxiety was so high I was panicking for no reason for most of the day. Now it’s calmed down a bit and it’s just mild. Anybody strolling through this forum who has not experienced this before... a word of warning my friend. Weed can be very addictive and the withdrawals can be rough. Don’t start smoking it, drinking tinctures or taking edibles. Do not do that unless you truly have a need for it and doctor’s permission.

It seems like my withdraw’s are waning now. I should get better soon. Anybody else who is withdrawing... hang in there. You can do it. It’s tough, you’ll want to smoke some to help you sleep or reduce the nausea. Whatever you do, do not take a single puff of it. Throwing up or not being able to sleep is not the end of the world.

Luckily I survived and I don't have psychotic or schizoid symptoms anymore, I stayed at the mental hospital for a month and well, I 'recovered' and came home to my family for further recovery. 

Sorry for venting this much, the thing is I know exactly when my trauma started, and since then my consumption is peaking, fooling me and making me think that I might be better, and functional (I take my meds and have psychiatric help, but I cant discuss my addiction yet, I'm so ashamed not to be able to quit even when my whole body tore apart).

The thing is, now that I'm quitting again, I see how my heavy smoking was only a distraction not to focus on a trauma that I still can't discuss with my therapist or friends, but I feel that its the first step towards healing and looking at your demons right in the eyes, and quitting has helped me putting in words feelings that I used to benumb. It's been only a few days this time, and don't take me wrong, I had to move back home in order to stop buying and smoking, and now that I have been readmitted in my medicine graduation and gotta go back to the big city, I don't know if I'm going to be able to keep it going. 

Anyway, everytime we quit, is a step towards healing, even when there's no motivation left, and life burns harder when we are sober.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975702166557312}"

What the ever loving fuck?,"I smoked every day for about a year and most days for 3 years before that. It used to be fun. What made me decide to quit was the panic attacks I was getting while high. I've always suffered with anxiety and always had panic attacks. The ones I had in the last couple of weeks of smoking were absolutely horrendous and nothing like my regular panic attacks. This felt like coming face to face with Death himself, the panic attacks lasted way longer than my regular panic attacks and left me feeling like I wasn't 'real'. So I decided to quit.


 About 4 days after quitting I started getting those same weed panic attacks while not high. I spent every waking second battling with my own brain to try and not have a panic attack. If I thought about the wrong thing for even a second my mind would descend into all consuming terror. I am excellent at hiding a panic attack. I'd be at work (I work with disabled kids) And because I can hide it I did. Then I'd spend the rest of the day feeling like I was watching through someone else's eyes as they worked with my kids. I'd come home from work and my husband would hug me and I could feel his arms around me but it wasn't my body. That went on for about 2 weeks. 


I won't lie, I was considering suicide. I couldn't live in a state of constant terror. I also never tell anyone when I'm having a panic attack. It makes it a million times worse because what I need is for everything to be absolutely normal but the second someone knows you're having a panic attack they start to act differently even if you tell them not to, they can't help it. So the easiest way to get people to act normal is to not tell them! Im past the worst of it. A week ago I couldn't have even thought about writing this. I do still have to be extremely careful with where I let my thoughts wonder but no panic attacks in about 36hrs.


My husband has quit too, today is his first day. He gets anxiety when he smokes but not panic attacks. I'm so worried for him and I'm still nowhere near back to being mentally stable so if he does have similar problems I don't know if I'll be able to support him.

I guess I thought it would be easier for me this time because I ""only"" relapsed for some months and the first time I quit I did it after over 6 years of heavy use and started therapy to deal with my emotions and the quitting phase. 

So.. it is not easier, it actually feels harder this time. I was at school the first time I quit, and my family was still helping me pay bills, I didn't have as many responsibilities as now so I was able to basically show up at school and do the strict minimum which gave me time to deal with the quitting period. 

At the moment, I cannot function because I feel overwhelmed about the tasks I need to do, and I am not able to think clearly, making decisions is really tough, even very simple ones such as what to eat or what to reply to a friend.. I also feel depressed, even if I know my life is much better than what it was when I was smoking I am not able to get rid of this feeling. My mind is not clear or organised.. to give you a metaphor it's like a huge library where all the books collapsed on the floor and I have no idea where to put them back + it would take a long time to do so.

I spent the last 3 days in my bed.

I have come to the conclusion that I should try and replicate that time when I didn't have too many responsibilities in order to get back on track and then be able to deal with all of it. That would be to basically pay all my bills one month ahead of time (I work as an independent/I have the luxury to be able to do that), deal with the admin tasks I HAVE to do and then take a month off, during this months I wouldn't be doing nothing obviously but I would be able to take care of myself and focus on things that will make me feel better. Seeing friends, going on walks, clearing and organising the mess I call my home, eat properly, and so on.

I know that a lot of people would disagree with this way of dealing with what is going on because in our society we are pretty much used to quick reactions and if there's an issue it has to be solved straight away but I do feel like this would be a solution to gradually feel better.

 I would be grateful if I got replies or reactions on this post but if I don't it's been good for me to write things down anyway.

Not gonna lie, its not been great. I derived my self esteem/worth/ sense of self through my accomplishments and thought I was something special since I did it while high. Turns out I was mirroring some internal process of resisting parts of my being. 

&#x200B;

Basically I have not matured much emotionally at all these past ten years and these last two have really showed me that! I guess they call it paws, but coming up on 2 years clean (only smoked once during this time and it was terrible...) I still dont feel completely out of the woods, all though lately its been getting exponentially better. 

&#x200B;

I dont really know what to say. My name is... Im an addict. I have also quit drinking and stopped having casual sex. All of which I guess has caused a major gap in my systems expectation and caused the depressed mood Ive been in for some time. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes it feels like coming out of a ten year long panic attack, and when that feeling hits, when I can hear my tinnitus or just my environment without the buzz of thought or anxious energy wondering ""what now, what next"" then its really worth it... 

&#x200B;

The most important thing motivating me right now to not continue using I actually think is my dreams. After quitting I started routinely writing down my dreams and working on them, and this process has given me insight, I think, and helped speed up my growth. I know that if I start smoking again this will stop. Also, is it just me, or is it like the act of getting high was way better than actually being high?

I have been routinely going to this site for support and reading other peoples stories, so figured I should chime in. I am enough, you are enuff, we are nuf

I thought I'd share a check-in as I've recently passed the 60 day threshold. I'd really like to emphasize two things for those of you that are just starting out or struggling:

1) As others have said, if you tried and failed in the past...KEEP TRYING. I was a regular smoker for 6 years. Found this sub a little over a year ago. Tried and failed many times and this is now the longest I've gone without smoking in a very long time. Even though I failed in all of my previous attempts, I keep pushing and eventually got to 60 days. YOU CAN DO IT. I do not crave marijuana anymore and the idea of getting high becomes less and less appealing by the day. The key is to not beat yourself up and allow yourself to experience the struggle. Lean into it, it's part of the process. 

2) For those of you in the 30-45 day range and still struggling, KEEP RESISTING. I've only started feeling ""better"" in the least 1-2 weeks. Depending on your usage it could take longer. Hang in there. There is light. If you're dealing with extreme anxiety (I was convinced I was going to die or something was horribly wrong with me for the first 3 weeks), go get a check-up at the doctor if you have the means. If you can, take time off of work and relax. Sleep if you need to because of the exhaustion. At the 60 day mark, I'm only JUST now starting to regain interest in all the things I loved to do without getting high. 

I hope this helps. Keep FIGHTING. We're all rooting for you.",3,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.973574697971344}"

I’m new here, and I guess hoping for a place to learn, vent, find motivation and accept that I have a real problem. I’m sorry this is gonna be wayyy too long, no need to read it all! I have just been completely overwhelmed lately with the realization of exactly how horribly I’ve let weed effect my life. I need to let it out and actually really say it for the first time. 

I was surprised, but am so happy to have found this subreddit. Ive spent hours & shed many tears reading through success and struggle stories from the wonderful people here that I can so closely relate too. 

For way too long I was confident in the belief that weed was in no way a detrimental or addicting drug, and that it had little to no negative impact on my life. My peers, media, legalization and personal experience only further confirmed this in my mind. Ive been smoking everyday for 10 years, and casually for a few years prior. 

After about a year of regular use, I could tell it left me more irritable when not high. I also had trouble with eating sober- although my appetite has long since evened out. If I had to be away from it during travel it sucked, but I in no way felt withdrawal besides minor trouble sleeping. In my mind, the benefits blew those things away. 0 problems sleeping, allowed me to control & lose weight, meals taste 5x better, cured cramps or a hangover like nothing else and I loved to just chill & laugh for the night. 90% of my friends, many acquaintances, the few relationships I’ve had and even my family smokes. 

I saw no issue with my life as a smoker. I honestly didn’t plan or think I’d ever want to stop, except in the case of a pregnancy break. I excelled in life in my early-mid twenties all while smoking at least every night. I graduated from an extremely difficult program with honours, all while working almost FT, having a great social life, taking care of myself and all my chores with a great man who loved me. 

Maybe 5 years back things slowly started to fall apart. I’m not sure if this first clue was directly related to smoking, or just me changing, but I have my suspicions. The first thing I remember is becoming unhappy in so many aspects of my life. Although already thin, I started to starve myself in hopes of being prettier. When that didn’t make me happy a new relationship would, right? I left the person who was there for me more than anyone else, and have continued to do stuff like this back and forth only to always regret it. Maybe if I make new friends, maybe if I move, change jobs.. I started craving attention and affirmation that I never needed before, and its always short lived. There is always something I need and obsess over that I’m convinced will make me happy, but it never does.

A couple years later the anxiety came. I became anxious while driving and being around new people. Little things like being a minute late would have me in tears. I hated any kind of change to my life or routine. I lost all confidence in myself concerning my serious career and abilities to succeed. Then the loss of motivation followed.. could barley keep my room clean and laundry up-kept, never mind starting on one of the many projects I’d always need to have done. I stopped cooking and doing self care routines I loved. Instead of just at night I started smoking when I woke up and as long as I could while just laying in bed until I had to go to work. Then I’d be an anxious mess getting there in a rush to not be late. 

The social anxiety came last but is whats killed me the most. I used to be the most social popular girl, friends with everyone. Would do anything for my friends and people I cared for. I loved to talk and would never have a problem upholding a conversation with anyone. 
So then I also started drinking semi often about 2 years ago. I used to only ever drink on a weekend for a party, until I realized it made me less sad (haha, ya right!). It did make me more confident interacting with people the way I used too though. The last year has got to the point that I would drink anytime I needed that anxiety gone. Going out with friends? I’m drinking before we even meet up for the pre drink so I don’t have to talk to anyone for even a minute as my sober self. Send a text, have a convo that makes me even a bit nervous? Get drunk. Date? Event/Outing? That’s a given. There’s been times that I’ve had to drink just to open someone’s reply to a message. Sometimes I don’t respond for days, or ever, or just randomly end conversation. This has taken a huge toll on all relationships in my life and of course ruined some too. All of this has also been extremely unhealthy and has drained even more energy and light from me. 

Although I am thankful to have at least kept my work ethic and have a good job, it’s not the one I struggled and worked so hard for. I wasted all that time and money just to deal with the embarrassment and anxiety I get whenever someone brings up why I’m not doing that. I barley drive, I have trouble even keeping up with my absolute favourite hobby that used to just put me over the moon. I have trouble giving my dog all the attention he deserves (not needs, he is well taken care of don’t worry) and I cry thinking about how I should play with him more. I’m scared of losing my dream of being happy with someone and having a family, I’m getting older now and I’ve always dreamt of being a mom. I feel like I’ve failed to become a self sustaining adult. I think about all the things I’ve held myself back from, all the hurt I’ve caused and felt, all the passion and love for life I’ve lost 

If anyone has read all this I appreciate  your time. I’m hoping that finally writing this all out and really admitting it to myself (even though I’ve known it to be true deep down) will help me finally pull myself together. I hope I can get back to that girl I used to be. I don’t even know her at this point, but remembering all the hopes and dreams I used to have, seeing pictures where my smile is so genuine and my eyes are shinning gives me hope. I try and remember and convince myself that even though I’ve wasted so much of my time and ruined so many good aspects of my life, I can still turn it around, and I still have lots of living to do.

I never thought weed could effect my mood, personality and life this way even when I’m not actually high. It took me so long to realize weed was a big part of the problem, because I did great as a regular smoker for many years. I am currently stuck working at home for lockdown 2 so it’s even harder to not smoke and drink without getting out of the house to distract me. I haven’t been drinking much, and am on day 3 of only 1 bong right before sleep (compared to the 5-15 I was doing). I don’t know how I will let go of that bedtime bong, by that time I’m desperate to knock out and not think, but it is a start for now. Hopefully soon I can start thinking about cutting that out too.

Also please forgive me if my paragraphs are not top notch.

I'll quickly set the scene, I'm a 25 year old guy that basically gets very apathetic when I smoke. I started at about 19 socially and eventually switched to solo smoking basically all the time. The first breakup was years ago and I have self-developed quite a bit since then, so I won't elaborate beyond the fact that it ruined a solid 3 year ltr.

Flash forward to june of this year in the heat of lockdown. I met my now ex and we very quickly fell into quarantine infatuation. I was not smoking and was generally very healthy and happy. We connected a lot and made a lot of plans together. But after a few months mary jane found its way into my life again and I immediately became a different person. My once vibrant self became lethargic and lacked much of any energy. My ex is outgoing and artistic but needs lots of support with her mental well being and soon became jaded. She did not know about my smoking bc I was ashamed, and inside of my haze I didn't notice I was neglecting her. 

About a week ago she became very distant and it sobered me up so fast. I quit cold turkey but, unfortunately, in the heat of the withdrawals last night she asked me over to talk (about breaking up). It went generally well because we are both similarly even tempered and still care for eachother. She said she didn't feel we were compatible anymore and I told her that it was my fault for smoking and expressed my intention to give my all to reconcile, but she had reservations and felt she needed to work on herself alone. 

Anyway, now I'm stuck with 2x the withdrawals and so much regret. I know I will heal, but damn.

Please, whatever you do, don't be like me. Don't let this drug take everything from you.. twice.

I have done this a few times before and I’ve noticed that it was the same all of the times. At first, it did not think that my “withdrawal symptoms” even had anything to to do with quitting, but after this recent time, I’m beginning to think it’s related. Any advice or information would be appreciated. 

I have been smoking on and off soft a few years, but I have always only smoked during the night time. In my 4 years of smoking, I never once had an urge to smoke during the day. It’s always been a very casual “I feel like smoking tonight” sort of sesh and I would end up smoking between 8pm and 12am. During 2020, I began to smoke almost every day, but it was always during the nighttime hours. It has been mostly wax that I have been smoking, but more recently it had been flower. At any rate onto my point...

All three times that I decided I wanted to stop, I would feel like absolute garbage. At first, it was confusing because I thought that weed never had any super noticeable physical withdrawal symptoms. They all started out the same. Day 1, I would start to feel a loss of motivation and feeling sort of cloudy even though I had not smoked; mainly psychological symptoms. By day 2, my appetite would be completely gone and I would end up feeling sick and sometimes throwing up. But here’s the catch; I only felt these symptoms as soon as the sun went down and it was time for me to start “thinking” about smoking again. During the daytime hours, I felt completely fine; still hungry and motivated, but as soon as night rolled around, it was like I contracted a fever. I had very bad headaches, nausea, chest pain, appetite loss, sensitivity to light, and I felt I had trouble catching my breath. Lots of symptoms, but not many of the typical marijuana withdrawal ones such as insomnia. This would continue for the next 3-5 days before I would return back to normal. 

I have suffered from a few point of anxiety in my life, but I feel like whenever I stop smoking, it comes back. Some things about these symptoms just never made sense. Why was my anxiety flaring up when I stopped smoking? I never used weed to cope with anything, but strictly recreational, so I’m not sure why this would happen. Also, why are these symptoms only during the night time? I feel I don’t really even smoke enough to be having these withdrawal symptoms in the first place. I always read about people smoking all day every day for numerous years and then having these symptoms, but I seem to be getting them for smoking only 5-7 days straight and only at a particular time a day.

I am hopeful I can get support from this group as I’ve seen so many successful stories and positive messages! Thank you for reading this in advance! :)

I’ve been smoking about 5-10 bowls from a bong daily and overnight for the last year (about an ounce a week), and I’m cutting back over the next two weeks to quit. 

I have tried quitting cold turkey twice in the last 2 months without cutting back and ended up in the hospital both times for malnutrion because I have so much intense upper GI pain (spasms, cramping, tightness), vomiting, and nausea when I stop that I am unable to eat or drink or hardly function. Does anyone experience this when they quit or even when they try to cut back? My GI doc recommended cutting down my heavy use first and then riding out the pain when I quit in two weeks. 

Also, the GI doc gave me an antispasmodic pill to try for the pain but it doesn’t touch it. The ONLY relief I get is from a hit or a rip. I also have had excess burping and acid reflux since I have cut back. He gave me meds for that and it has since gotten so much better!

Over the last week I have cut back to 3-4 bowls a day (going to do 1-2 bowls a day next week before I quit), and I’m really suffering. I cannot believe how much I am suffering from cutting back to still smoking 3-4 bowls a day. I’m completely ashamed of myself. The top of my abdomen is completely cramped up. That pain is by far the worst withdrawl symptom. I’m nauseous constantly but I am keeping up my nutrition this time with shakes, smoothies, bland foods, etc. I admit I can really only tolerate this because I am still smoking (although at least 75% less quantity), and that eases the pain. I can’t be in this place in two weeks. 

I am extremely committed to stopping in two 
weeks for very important family reasons, and I could use some support for this horrible upper tummy pain I experience. I have even considered going to an in-patient type of rehab facility so they could help manage the pain (is that even possible?), but I am so ashamed and feel very weak and wimpy doing that.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973441958427429}"

Quitting weed coincided with losing all my friends, going vegan and starting to exercise for me. It feels like I changed so much at once and I felt really good about it for a while. Now I’m stagnant again and I am craving some kind of relapse, whether it be a pizza or a joint or both. The solution is to excise more indulgences I think. We all have too many vices. Food and weed were my major ones, but now that I’ve settled into a routine without them, I can see pretty clearly that laziness is my remaining vice. It takes the form of sleeping too much, having ridiculous amounts of screen time and being addicted to PMO.

As many of my Dutch peers did, I started smoking weed around 15. I'm 24 now and have been smoking on a daily basis for the past 6 years. At first it seemed to help my mental state of mind but it actually drove my depression further and further. It took me a while to become fully aware of the extent of the problem and I have suffered the loss of people who cared about me and couldn't see me destroy myself anymore. My problems kept piling up resulting in debt, severe depressive episodes and  inability to feel real emotions. I was also unable to solve anything while I'm still using. I have made myself believe for too long that I could function with this drug in my life. I can't. 
I realize now fully how much I have destroyed in my life while life had so much potential. Unfortunately, I can't go back to change that. But to see this community of people who are all trying to move forward (hopefully, in acceptance of the mistake they have made) makes me feel less alone in this fight. I have tried to quit numerous times before but I'm blessed to feel fully motivated to endure this for the last time. 
It's not easy. Not even close. But I hope we can all together realize that the benefits of staying away from this 'silent assassin' will keep piling up.

I’m a 31 (f) – I took my very first toke when I was 12 years old.  I was trying to be cool and was hanging with the wrong crowd.  Coughed up a lung and hated it.  Didn’t touch it again until I went to university.  There, I would smoke the occasional joint after a night out or the morning after to pacify the hangover.  It wasn’t until I met my fiancé that I started smoking daily – I was 23.

I wasn’t the kind of stoner who smoked all day, but I’d smoke all night and all weekend. I own a few bongs, I’ve dabbled in dabs and I didn’t mind a good edible every so often.

When my 30th birthday rolled around, I didn’t take it well.  I started to feel the fog; notice the clouds occupying my mind and the general haze that seemed to dull out my memories.  Where had my life gone?  Where did all my hopes and dreams go?  Where did my motivation and ambition go?  Was this the best it was gonna get?  Is this the best version of me?  Am I truly happy with who's staring back at me?

I saw someone on here once say (I’m paraphrasing and probably not doing it justice, so whoever you are, sorry for butchering it, but thank you for sharing it because it stuck with me), when you go on a bender, whatever your choice of drug, you see a noticeable difference in your appearance within days—but marijuana, she hides in the shadows—first making you feel good, then hooking you unknowingly to you, and then years later, you look in the mirror and wonder where the time went.

That’s what marijuana does; it takes time.  It convinces you that it’s better to stay in than going out.  It convinces you that you’re better this way.  It convinces you that it'll protect you from all those bad feels.  It convinces you that you need it to sleep, to socialize, to decompress, to manage your stress—whatever you need it to do for you at that particular point in time.  It’s an attraction that grows slowly, pretty much consuming you by the end of it.

For me, it feels like fog.  A thick, ever consuming fog.  Everyday I feel like that fog has taken more of who I am and hidden it somewhere deep within.  I wake up and I feel like I’ve failed at living the life I always wanted – and it’s not that I’m not capable, it’s that somehow, I convince myself that I’ll just do it tomorrow, after this hit, this toke, this joint.   But tomorrow turned into a week, a week turned into a month, a month turned into a year and, here we are, 8 years later.  Where the fuck did I let my time go??  Who am I anymore?

I made it 32 days last time--that was almost 4-6 months ago (the haze makes it hard to be certain).  Making it to 32 days was like ice fishing, fucking exhilarating (points if you get this reference--best movie ever lol).  I caved – work became busy and the stress kicked in and I decided to feel sorry for myself and thought that just one more time wouldn’t hurt all my progress.  But it did, and I’m here to say not again; not anymore.

Today I pledge that this is my last day one.

This time will be different.  I feel different about it.

I will check in next Monday.

Because of the move, I don't have a support network here at all - no friends, family, coworkers, etc. that I can lean on who aren't 1500 miles away. The lack of social pressure has been really noticeable, especially since I'm an asocial person to begin with and have admittedly very few ""real"" friends. Since March, I've slid from a session every day or two (already far more than I was comfortable using) to 3 or 4 sessions daily, and basically my entire daily life has become architected around my use.

Most of the time, I'm drawn to use because I want to feel motivated by the energy I hope it will imbue me with. I've dealt with depression and anxiety problems since I was very young, and they usually manifest as a lack of energy and motivation to do anything. The rush of motivation from using rarely happens, but as I type this, that's the strongest feeling I associate with my use despite the enormous damage it's done to my life in such a short time, and how often it devolves into a bad trip of guilt, shame, and anxiety about my use.

I keep falling back into using after I've had enough time in sobriety to take full stock of the damage this illness has caused and the sheer amount of effort it will take to return to a place in life that I was already unsatisfied with. Work, friends, family, my relationship, everything has firmly-rooted tendrils of lies that I told and terrible decisions I made to hide my use, and seeing the whole iceberg is so overwhelming that I give up hope.

I reached out to someone I trust today, and they were supportive and understanding and strongly encouraged me to seek out help. I have hope that I can move on from this and I want to capitalize on that hope to begin my recovery, but I have the benefit of foresight and I'm afraid of the very long road ahead. I'm usually avoidant of difficult, emotional conversations, but I know many of those lie ahead of me if I want to get out of the secret-keeping business that got me in this position.

Not really sure what I expect to get out of this post or its responses, but I would appreciate any advice from those with similar backgrounds on coping strategies to avoid hyperfixating on the idea of using again? I'm also looking for advice on how to mentally pull myself out when I realize that I'm in the middle of thinking about using. When I've recognized it in the past, I've not had a plan to deal with it, and the thoughts end up running rampant.

I've been drinking caffeine since I was about 8 years old,so I know my withdrawals probably won't be over in a week or 2. And ofcourse I've upped up my caffeien use the older I got (23 now). As for the weed, it helped me alot in the begging ( reason #1 why I quit alcohol completely) but now it's getting out of hand. Wasting money and not even getting high anymore ( high tolerance),aswell as negative thoughts while high,I just don't visit my ""happy"" place when I smoke anymore.

I don't know why, but I feel like I'll never let these two (pot + coffee) out of my life. Any suggestions ? Why is it so damn hard to quit. What's the best way you managed to let go? Was it gradually or cold Turkey? 

FYI caffeien has been harder to quit for me than weed. I've done 28 day tolerance brakes in the past but end up going back to the same pointless getting high daily till I just waste money routine. With coffee I'd say max was 9 days, then I had to drink a cup of joe.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.99864262342453}"

Hopefully we can all come here and share our little tips.,"1. You need to have solid reasons for why you NEED to quit. Wanting to quit, liking the idea of quitting WILL NOT cut it. Creating ideas of why you need to quit, identifying real issues you have because of your addictions is the best foundation for a new life. 

2. Your thoughts truly to become who you are. If you tell yourself everyday that quitting is so hard and so miserable, it will be hard and it will be miserable. You have to tell yourself you can do it, tell yourself you have things to accomplish that smoking prevents you from doing. 

3. Connect your addictions, goals and dreams. Realize your addictions slow or stop your goals and that process is the very reason your dreams may not be coming true. 

4. Use resources like this to talk, vent, and communicate with others who are going through similar issues. People today in the western world will literally ridicule you for struggling with quitting and even tell you to indulge with them. I recently had covid and one of my closest and dearest friends told me to smoke up and feel better. Yes, people are that indoctrinated that they will suggest it for covid. Keep your journey to yourself and others on the same path and make more friends who live a sober lifestyle. Sadly, a lot of your stoner friends will have to go but luckily they will most likely remove themselves from your life as your use to them will be gone as most stoners literally revolve around weed and once that is gone, so are you in their mental space.

5. Relapsing is totally okay. There's no reason to give up the war because of one lost battle. Success isn't a straight line and there's nothing to be ashamed of. 

6. Pay attention to how much you spent on it and how much more money you have to invest, save, buy things you never could before.

7. Watch your eating habits change. For some people it changes for the worse, but most of the time your entire mindset toward food changes for the better. This was huge for me as a person who has been wanting and trying to lose weight for years. I am down almost 20 pounds in a month and a half and I just eat so many more healthy food and have stopped eating junk food so often. 

8. Track your social engagements and general sociability. For many of us, we have seen big improvements in communication and especially listening. Everyone tells you that weed makes you so in tune with things but it couldn't be further from the truth.  You are just waiting to smoke again and you'll ignore that you've just glazed over other's points more than your eyes are. 

I honestly have more but this has gotten so long. I hope that any of this can help people out there! If I've gotten anything wrong please let me know.",9,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.968703031539917}"

I started smoking my senior year of high school after a friend finally convinced me to try it, right before going away to college. It immediately became a bad habit and coping mechanism I couldn't get away from. I ended up dropping out of college after a year, because I felt like my memory and brain had taken a shit and I struggled with the social aspect of college. Fast forward 12 years, after struggling a lot with depression and anxiety severely for the last 3 years and using weed and food to cope, I eventually received a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis and that was my wake up call to get my shit together. I've lost 50 lbs since March and am regularly active for the first time in my life and my mental health is so much better than it has been in a long time. I feel like a new person, but I also have finally realized that weed is still hindering me from becoming the person I'd like to be; so after running my stash out and throwing away all the paraphernalia, today is my first day weed free. Planning to stay close to this community as I inevitably struggle with withdrawal symptoms and cravings.

I have been clean off that for months and it wasn't on my radar. But I got drunk and on auto-pilot contacted an old plug. 

Fast-forward after a week of horrible relapse, and using weed to get off it again, and I am back to square one.

I am currently on day 2 of quitting. I am 20F and smoked for the past 5 years and smoked daily for about 3 years. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety a year and a half ago. This is all caused by childhood trauma due to my dad abusing me mentally and sometimes physically. I have tried quitting before but always caved and I think that was because my only reason back then to quit was money. Recently however I have realised that I truly am an addict. This caused for a lot of emotions but I also realised weed isn't what it used to be for me anymore. I realised its holding me back and no longer helping with my anxiety but rather causing more reasons for this anxiety. Both my and my boyfriend of 2 and a half years have made the decision to quit together. I dont have any cravings so far but I get these sudden panic attacks and it just leaves me incredibly sad. I worry about choices I have to make that are still 2 years in the future, I am worried of losing all my friends back home (I am an international student). I am just wondering if this is a withdrawal symptom and will leave or is this sadness just what my life is gonna be like sober?

Strangely though I’ve had very little of that. Sure my anxiety is a little elevated but nothing crazy and I’ve actually had good sleep.

Even stranger, I’ve barely thought about weed. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had some cravings but usually at this point it’s a battle to stop myself from going to the dispensary. Yesterday evening I realized I had gone the entire day without thinking about weed.

The things is, I don’t necessarily want to quit. I want so badly to be able to moderate and keep it to weekends or special occasions only. But I’ve proven time and again that moderation is not possible for me. Once I get over the first week or so I find it’s MUCH easier to abstain than it is to try and moderate.

Like many people here I struggled with loathing myself when I did get high, And wanting nothing more than to smoke when I was sober.  I struggled with this for years before I took the final steps to quit.  The most important aspect to quitting for good is to finally make the decision of your own volition,  to do it for the betterment of your future self.  Quitting has been miraculous, I am sleeping better, more energetic, I can focus on tasks, I am more efficient with tasks, I enjoy my hobbies more, I am more engaging in social situations,  All my relationships have improved across the board, I had a bad habit of being too stoned to answer phone calls of people that needed something, or wanted to see me.  Eventually people, even my own family, just gave up on calling me.  To be frank if you are abusing the drug, you need to be honest with yourself and distance yourself.  Trust me its causing more problems than you realize.  After you make it through the toughest parts you really will connect with the old you, the positive, motivated you that isn't scared to go out and handle your responsibilities.

2020-11-16 04:40:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jv43jj/the_reason_why_i_quit/,The reason why I quit.,"Well...like many interesting stories on here, I would also like to share some light on my own experiences and what I learned from my relationship with Marijuana.

To give a little context of myself, I am a socially anxious person, with a very hyperactive mind. I have struggled with depression and difficult emotions for most of my life, and have long suffered from these psychological problems within my mind for as long as I can remember.

So when I first got high, and found this God given flower can help calm my mind, make me less anxious, masking all those negative psychological emotions and experiences, while at the same time stimulating my mind and for the first time... I felt a sense of bliss, wonder, just being happy to be present in that moment. Being in that higher state of mind also increased my self awareness, my appetite, and my desire for life. To me, it was like a breath of fresh air, a new life, a new me, a better me...I was in a state of Joy. 

This new found experience was profound, powerful in its realization, it was like I found something that can instantly cure my depression, warm my soul, relieve me from the dreadful state of suffering and tribulations that burdened me. At this point..my life completely turned 180, I began to create a new self narrative story in which it has slowly became ingrained in my psyche and identity. 

Marijuana gave me a new sense of Me, it was nice to me, it is my friend and it was at this point where I began to develop a very close and strong relationship with it. Marijuana has become my new brother, sister, a good friend whose always by my side and will always help me when I need it to. So I thought, ""Why would I ever possibly give this up?"" 

As with all relationships, the beginning is always great, fun, enjoyable, and more will later be revealed as the relationship begins to unfold in the years to come by. As I move on and grow with Marijuana, my tolerance with it also became stronger, and so, I saw myself gradually smoking it more and more, until recreational usage with it became all the time, anytime, anywhere, everywhere. I began to use it and be with her everyday, every thing I did, whether having fun times hanging out with friends or it was doing mundane chores at home, studying, enjoying my own company. Marijuana as pure and innocent like a flower, was ALWAYS there with me and for me in all aspects of my life.. from my highs and my lows. It has become something that I NEED in my life, just like the need of food for survival, I needed this to become functional. In fact I began to self medicate with it and at the same time heavily abuse it for its medicinal and healing powers.

Fast forward few years, living alongside with Marijuana for so long and having it preoccupy my mind and thoughts over time, I began to see my life and my psyche radically change. I became increasingly more paranoid of myself socially or at home, my addiction was so deep that I became obsessed and in turn developed selfish behaviors as my addictions drives my actions and attitude. I am becoming more forgetful with everyday essentials for example, leaving my car keys inside the house, or and simple reminders such as telling someone about something I was going to say just a minute ago before that thought would vanish from my mind.  

The great high I once had at the beginning was never experienced again and I found myself chasing that bliss, feeling of self confidence and self esteem I once had with Marijuana slowly starts to fade away. Gradually my life, my family, my friendships start to break down and I become increasingly harder to be around and live with, on or without Marijuana. And It was at this point that I began to lose myself and my sense of presence. 

Then one day...I came to a sudden realization, all those years, this thing that I once thought served me best and greatly in so many ways of my life has conversely wasted my life and most importantly my time in between. I realized Marijuana has never given me a chance to heal my mind and strengthened my spirit. I never developed and learned the skills to get through the pain and psychological challenges that I have struggled with originally and during my years being with Marijuana, I would always smoke to write the pain off. Marijuana, told me that everything was okay, not to worry about the problems I had to deal with just have a smoke. This epiphany, was a massive wake up call. 

Marijuana had not healed me, instead it had put a soft, warm blanket over my old problems and current issues. I inevitably knew that if wanted to be better and seek redemption for my soul, I was going to have to eventually deal with these demons myself. and so now, after three months of sobriety and en route to self recovery, I am beginning to see and think very clearly.  There's no longer a mist which clouds my judgements, and now I find myself doing things which are more useful to me, which my future self and people that I care about in my life can benefit from. 

I have now entered a new world, new found freedom of will and wisdom to pursue a better life, a path to new kind of legacy which I can look back upon and be proud of.

TL;DR - It simply did not serve me any purpose in my life. In my own experience, Marijuana has taken my free will away and diminishes my soul, my spirit over time.",109,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9971868395805359}"

With only taking a hit or two from a pipe I’d feel fantastic. I was always excited to indulge back then. Every chance I had to smoke I would. Every time my friends and I would hang out, our intentions to get completely baked didn’t need to be spoken as that was the routine at that point. The high was clouding my judgment as to what I actually need to be focused on. 

I had quit around my birthday in sophomore year as a self promise and one that made my then girlfriend happy. This lasted till I got my first job. Where I started to smoke again with my coworkers. Thats when consistent smoking started for me. I was spending a lot of money on weed, losing drive in life, and putting stress on my family relationships. 

This kind of behavior continued and once I turned 18 a couple months ago, I finally went to get my medical card. To say the least I was absolutely ecstatic and thought of the advantages were intoxicating to me. Once I got the card everything went downhill. 

The high isn’t fun anymore. I spend more time thinking about what Im doing with my life than enjoying it. I smoke just to feel better now. I have been having such existential dread thinking about my life choices. I desperately want to get my life back on track. So now today Ive decided to finally quit, November 16th, 2020. 

I just want to say I have no hard feelings toward weed itself. I know there are many people out there that can lead great and fulfilling lives with weed. However, Im not one of those people. Maybe one day I’ll have a reunion when I’m at a better place in life.

Man, I was soooo wrong.

It was like my body went into a super asthmatic attack shortly after the high wore off. Despite the coughing and chronic wheezing, I used my inhaler and continued to vape for a total of two days before I told myself, okay no more. It made me realize just how strong the pull of weed was for me. I know it's causing destruction on my body but why was I still choosing to smoke?

This short relapse in the past would've made me SO mad. I would've been kicking myself, telling myself how stupid I was and asking myself, ""Why can't you be better than that?"" I think in some of my older posts, you can see how hard I am on myself... Now, I'm choosing to be more kinder to myself. Honestly, this experience showed me that I'm not 18 or 21 anymore, I have to start taking care of myself and my body. I needed more self-respect. I'm glad I relapsed because it taught me a lot. I realized that it just turns me into a walking zombie...

I'm back on track to being one week clean and the whole experience has truly been eye opening. As far as my asthma goes, I'm barely using my inhaler now and I can see a huge difference in my motivation. The wheezing has calmed down and I bought a cough/mucus suppressant and taking 1/4th of the dosage recommendation has proven to work for me. The coughing has stopped which I think also triggered my asthma.  I will say that I was depressed the first three days. I cried a few times which is not normal for me. This withdrawal was more terrible than the first few times I quit. I thought the crying was a withdrawal symptom which could be true but I also started my period a few days later.  That was another sign too....listen to your body, it's telling you a lot.

Overall, my mood and productivity has been improving. I'm more focused and more motivated to accomplish different tasks. Boredom strikes but I've been staying busy and learning all kinds of things off Youtube and TikTok such as basic etiquette skills, flipping real estate, how to style clothes, how to do my hair and so much more. I also started my notary loan signing course and I'm trying to get back into my aviation books as my pilot dreams are still alive. I know, I have a lot of goals for myself...

Cheers to everyone staying strong, staying busy and getting away from this plant. We can do better and we all deserve to live happy and healthy life. Don't follow the crowd, follow the calling.

I found it enormously difficult to moderate my intake, and so I’d smoke during all my free time. And even when I wasn’t high, I suffered from a distinct sluggishness and lack of clarity that directly tied to my cannabis intake.

Since I’ve quit, my memory has improved dramatically, I’m reading more — in fact I replaced my smoking habit with reading (I strongly recommend replacing smoking with something else you enjoy doing —although I’d warn against other drugs/alcohol) , I’m a more attentive friend, and I’m much more articulate (which, as a writer, is super important to me).

Last year I stopped using cannabis so I could focus on a project and ended up going without for 7 months. Long story short I indulged a little, then a little more; and then we’re in a pandemic and there felt like no downside to smoking to my heart’s content. In reality I’ve been heavily self-medicating. 

My relationship with weed has changed constantly, and I owe it to myself to stop and take inventory. I just think so highly of everyone who has stayed clean and/or sober during this time. I’ve fallen off the wagon hard. And while I am in a privileged position to be able to work from home, that feels like such a pernicious excuse to just smoke myself senseless. Sometimes it makes the bullshit feel more manageable but I know it’s not that simple. 

There just feels like so much trauma all around. It’s more than I can bear sometimes and I’m no doubt one of the lucky ones. I’m trying to weather the storm... I worry sick about loved ones who are less secure. Thankfully I’m still in counseling so I feel like I have support. I just hurt for the world right now and it’s so sad to see tragedy engulf my community and the world, with little end in sight... I wonder if that’s all the more reason to show up in a more authentic and present manner.

Went home last week after a year abroad. Part of going abroad was wanting to quit weed. The first months were hard, I even dreamed about weed and didn't know what to do with myself. 

Had to go back home for 2 weeks this month. It took me less than a day to talk myself into visiting the shop (they sell weed over the counter here). Told myself that I'm here for 2 weeks only, so no risk of getting addicted again right? Right??

The first joint didn't even taste that good. I bought 5 grams so forced myself towards the second one. I got too stoned, felt anxious and sick and had to sleep it off. I felt stupid. Stupid for buying weed, stupid for not just buying one joint but buying 5 grams that I now will have to finish, I'm not going to let good weed parish for another year while I'm going back abroad.
And stupid for getting too stoned, what kind of crap is this, I could easily smoke 2 grams a day, did I really just get too stoned to even move? I turn my Nintendo Switch on, too stoned for that even. I'm annoyed. I just sit here and feel weird, anxious and in a black hole.


Third joint the next day, wake and bake like the good old days. Nothing comes out of my hands that day. 5 hours later another joint. I'm bored, constantly bored. I thought that my year of sobriety would at least grant me laugh kicks, anything I had when I started to smoke because my tolerance is gone. But no, I either get too stoned and anxious, or I get lethargic. Nothing changed.

Also I'm diabetic and my munchies don't care at all. I ate more this week than normally in a month. I lost 25 kilos, but I don't dare to touch a scale right now. What am I doing to myself, what do I win with this?

Day 3, day 4, day 5. Back in my routine from years ago. Smoke, bored, play music, be lethargic, don't feel like answering texts from friends, eat a lot, nap time, roll another joint, smoke it, rinse and repeat.

And now im out of weed. Im sober now. I hate it. I hate being stoned, for the first time I see how lethargic I am when stoned. I always knew it but thought it was in my personality. I'm in my 30s and just this last year, my sober year, I realised my range is more broad than just being tired or lethargic. 

But I'm back in my routine. I'm home, I'm out of weed, it's in the middle of the night, and I'm anxious. Because I'm out of weed and I want to smoke, I need to have it in my house, I'm nervous and anxious for not having it.

One week. It just took me one week to get back to the lethargic addict I used to be for all those years.

I'm very tempted to just get another 5 grams tomorrow. Even though I know that it will shush my anxiety, I also know I will feel lethargic, tired and hungry all the time again. And I don't know why I choose this. It's a choice. 

In 2 weeks I'll be traveling again, be clean again. No access to weed there, it gives me an excuse. 

I'm so, so, so disappointed in myself. I really thought I was done with it.

I will quit again.

I just hate this feeling, this duality in wanting it so bad and at the same time hating it so much. I thought this would be easier after almost a year of being clean.

I had to vent somewhere, sorry.

I've never posted on reddit, but I'm really excited about joining this group and not going through all of this alone. 

I quit weed 4 days ago and the withdrawals have been absolutely brutal. My body temperature has been going up & down like crazy which has been crazy uncomfortable and making me miserable. My emotions have also been completely out of whack (crying for no reason, screaming into my pillow, unreasonably agitated, etc...).

I know that I am 100% addicted to it and have been using it all day every day to curb my quarantine depression & anxiety. It helped me feel less alone since I live with my senior-aged parents, and have been pretty much in total isolation since moving back home in May after graduating college. I felt like I NEEDED weed to manage my situation and numb by painful sense of loneliness. I already have and take medication for anxiety and depression, but nothing worked as quickly or effectively as weed. I truly felt like I needed it to survive or make it through the end of the day.

The truth is I know that weed has been harming my brain and greatly affecting my memory and mental functioning. I constantly forget what the topic of a conversation is midway through it, even if I brought it up in the first place or was speaking about it passionately just 30 seconds before... it's embarrassing plus truly frightening how easy it is for my mind to go blank. I feel like I'm just floating meaninglessly through life, self-medicating through weed even though I know it doesn't work in the long-run and is causing more harm than good.

I'm really happy I'm finally quitting, and although these withdrawal symptoms scare the shit out of me, I know it's not forever and I can eventually get through this. This seems like a really amazing group (I'm not sure if this is the official term as a novice reddit user) and I know it will make it easier to go through this one day at a time.

I have been a smoker for about 7 years (21M) and I mainly smoked to numb my brain from constant anxiety. I would have awful, anxious thoughts about interacting with people, (social anxiety has always been a problem for me) so I used weed to numb my brain into feeling nothing at all. I used to feel at home when I was in my bed, watching a movie, so toasted out of my mind I couldn’t even think or feel anything. Finding this sub helped convince me I needed to make a change and face my anxiety/depression problems head on, and not use a drug to make it feel like those mental issues were going away (they were never gone just numbed away!) First week was honestly pretty rough not gonna lie. Couldn’t eat to save my life, had trouble sleeping and I randomly cried a few times just from normal pressures that I usually deal with (school, finding a job, etc) but just reading through the posts on this sub made me feel like I HAD to keep going, cause I knew there was light at the end of the tunnel if I kept going. One thing that really helped me through it all was reminding myself everyday, when ai felt like shit and wanted to give up, why I wanted to kick the cannabis out of my life for good. I would ask myself, would the best version of myself really give in to the cravings and go smoke right now? the answer has and will always be NO!! and just like that I could convince myself that I chose the right path and was onto being the best version of myself. 2nd week and I started waking up happy and excited about life, I started eating more and more normally, and now I sleep pretty much like a baby every night. Now I wake up feeling refreshed and not groggy, my head is clearer, i’m reading everyday, and the motivation for school and work is on the come up again. To anyone struggling through right now, simply ask yourself: “would the best version of myself cave in to my cravings to smoking/dabs/edibles right now, and continue down this dark path?” The answer you tell yourself will keep you going down the path towards a fulfilling and enriching life, without the need for a drug that numbs ur brain.

WHEN I make it to next weekend I am going to treat myself to a massage (as long as they’re open from Covid). I was spending about $600 a month on weed so now I want to treat myself differently. Anyone else reading this that might be struggling, I feel you, it’s not easy, but I really am started to be proud.

I have an anxiety issue that compounds it a bit and I was constantly worried that the anxiety I felt was going to send me back to panic attacks. Unfortunately, I wasnt able to do a whole lot all week but luckily, my roommate was near an ""exposed"" person and was home to spend the week with me. 

I smoked about an oz/week since I was 15 so quitting was a huge change but I can already tell I feel more confident in myself even if I still feel depressed and sort of anxious. This is something I've been telling myself I should do for 6 or 7 years but could never convince myself to do it. Now that I have, I'm so glad but I keep having fears that this is just who I am and how I feel now. 

The biggest thing now is a mix of anxiety, mood swings, and constantly feeling cold. I'd like to get my appetite back too but anxiety always makes that difficult anyway. I think this is all consistent with quitting but it's still stressful. Any ideas how much longer it will be until I can go about pretty normal life?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9804377555847168}"

Since then I’ve pretty much being doing that, but with some periods of smoking/drinking more or less. This whole time, I have struggled with SEVERE memory issues that have only gotten worse over time (I’m talking, we’re having a conversation and I forget what I just said to you and what you just said ... in every conversation). The memory issues got worse even though I significantly reduced smoking. 

For the past month though, I haven’t smoked or drank at all (intentionally). And I feel waaay clearer mentally and I feel like I’m slowly beginning to actually remember things again. I thought I had permanently fucked my memory from all the weed, but maybe it’s possible it’ll come back with complete sobriety?

I started smoking regularly in my second year of university (2017). I learned how to order massive amounts of weed online (Canada) for cheap, so I never really needed to learn how to get in contact with a dealer, and never learned how to cope with dankruptcy because I never was.

Weed became a catch-all coping mechanism and largely a solitary activity. I smoked after class, before homework to “get myself in the right frame of mind” to study. I would smoke after studying as a reward. I would smoke with friends to socialize. Smoke before bed to sleep. This lasted until my last year of university. Weed never stopped me from getting my work done to an “acceptable” level, but I look back and wonder how much I was really missing because I was so concerned with getting high. 

Then, the pandemic really messed up my routine. I left my university and moved back in with my parents to finish the semester virtually. I started smoking all day, every day. After graduating virtually, I was unemployed, had no friends in my parents town, long-distance boyfriend and very few distractions - suddenly everything was about weed because I had nothing better to do. Who cares if you’re high all the time when you have no boss, no friends, no boyfriend that would notice? Everyone was saying “COVID is stressful! Self-care!” and I guess I equated self-care with self-medication. My parents were unimpressed with me, but didn’t say much because I was paying for it myself (thanks Daddy Trudeau!) and it isn’t like I was being disruptive or stealing from them. 

Finally, my circumstances changed. Despite my weed habit, I just got a full-time job in the field I studied. It’s my first grown up job and I relocated over 1200 km away from home to take it. I desperately want to be the employee they saw in the interview, and I know I can’t when I have my weed issue holding me back. Working for an organization like this has been my dream and goal since I started preparing for university in high school - and I’m finally doing it! 

So why am I still craving weed? Why is my brain saying “It’s Sunday afternoon, you don’t have anything going on, why not have a smoke and chill”? I don’t know how I’m supposed to fill my time? Even now as I’m writing this on a freakin’ quitting sub, I’m having thoughts about heading to the cannabis store and just buying one pre-roll to keep me sane for the rest of the afternoon.

I've smoked for 9 years and vaped for half a year. I've been meaning to quit but for whatever reason I couldn't myself. From my early teens (like 13) I had this very weird conviction that I will absolutely need some sort of substance to get me through life. I started smoking weed when I was 15. Vaping made me outright stop smoking both cigarettes and weed, as it tasted purely of tar, I loved it for the 6 months I did it. 

The real nail on the coffin of my cannabis abuse was my psychiatrist (I've only met him once so far). Admittedly, the first 3 days that I were on meds (he gave me bupropion and pramiracetam for my yet undiagnosed ADHD) I still smoked because the cravings were unreal. Afterwards, I muscled through the cravings and felt sick for the first 3 days of sobriety, then suddenly it all stopped, and I realised one thing - I only got high because I couldn't enjoy life sober. 

I found out that actually I don't need to be high at all to enjoy anything in life. It's very weird (strike contrast to what I believed for almost a decade). I also started going to the gym 5 weeks ago to fix my obesity, that probably helped a lot. I started doing research on why I was feeling like shit, and apparently, from what I understood, the endocannabinoid system gets lazy/spoiled by THC and in turn it is in distress when not being fed a constant amount of it.

What's crazy is last Friday I got wasted and (again, admittedly) high with some of my very best mates, celebrating one of them getting his new place, and the weed was just so ""meh"". I've never had such an uncaring reaction to weed, I always loved getting as high as possible without passing out and enjoyed cooking my brain, for lack of a better term. But now it's just ""meh"". I don't consider it breaking my streak as **I always felt the need to smoke when I was alone** \- I could either sleep or be high and somewhat functional.

So yeah, this is my bumbled mess of an introduction, sorry if it was an annoying read but if you've went through it, thank you for the read!

First of all i tried to convince myself that i was okay if i was around people smoking because i didn’t want to be left out considering all my friends smoke regularly. Don’t do that to yourself. It’s okay to chill inside while they smoke outside it’ll only be about 30 mins tops. 

The next part of my relapse was thinking I could smoke in moderation. At first i was thinking “only every few months” but that quickly turned into “once a month, okay twice a month, okay once a week, okay three times a week, okay once a day” then before i knew it i was smoking all day every day again. Moderation works for some, but it’s not as common as you would think. 

I thought i could keep my issues with addiction to myself. I thought no one needs to know and if i tell them it might freak them out or they’ll dismiss me because “weed’s not addictive it’s medicinal”. 

Turns out when you pretend you dont have a problem to other people you end up believing it in some capacity. Keeping a few close friends that know the extent of my issue and also my triggers around me whenever i’m in a situation where weed is going to be around is incredibly helpful. Sure some people will be assholes about it but i’ve found that they’re in the minority. 

Also i never realized how long it would take to make me stop craving it. Took probably 6 months to finally not feel the need to smoke or anything. But it does go away. Never 100% but the voice that tells you to succumb to smoking gets really quiet after a while and you’ll be able to drown it out with positive thinking. 

Final note: THERAPY. If you are in the position to receive mental health care USE IT. It is immensely helpful for every situation.

2020-11-15 10:31:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/junlvi/28_days_today_still_really_struggling/,"28 days today, still really struggling.","Hey all,

I'm nearing 30 days off weed (no other substances either, though weed is the only one that I've ever had a problem with) and I'm still having such a hard time. I'm feeling really hopeless and demoralized and having trouble getting through the intense, obsessive cravings, the anhedonia, and the insomnia.  I'm really struggling to hold on to why I'm doing this to myself when it feels like, if anything, I'm getting worse, not better.

I had almost 40 days last year before relapsing after the holidays (family, ugh - both my parents are severe, unrepentant alcoholics and also not nice people). I finally got myself restarted last month and went headlong into it -- I go to an MA meeting on zoom almost every day, sometimes two. I have a sponsor who I meet with 3 hours per week to do step work. I'm in an out patient substance abuse recovery program which involves 3 hours of group therapy and 2 hours of individual therapy per week and is DBT focused. I also have a separate trauma therapist and a psychiatrist who I meet with 1 hour per week each. Altogether I am doing between 15-20 hours weekly of recovery related stuff, not even counting the time I spend reading posts on this sub and chatting with other recovering marijuana addicts. It's legit like a part time job. I do not see any of the people I used to smoke with anymore (it's been basically just me smoking alone since I moved for work after finishing my degree), live far away from my parents and have very little contact with them, and I live with my amazing, supportive, loving husband who is totally uninterested in weed/alcohol/etc. after trying them with me a few times a decade ago. I live in an illegal state so it's not in my face all the time or anything. I'm also doing journaling and meditative yoga every day.

It was so hard to finally reach out for help and I felt so relieved to realize that it really was available to me. The first two weeks of sobriety were great -- I felt better physically and mentally, and I finally felt like I could do my actual job again, which was my biggest reason for quitting. Especially now that I'm working from home, I was finding myself frequently feeling too overwhelmed and anxious to work and just leaving my computer signed in to make it look like I was working and just smoking all day. I honestly love my job when I  am not feeling like an inhuman piece of garbage and I have worked very hard to get to the position I'm in, and while I've been able to keep up with the minimum I have to to hide how little I'm working, it is going to catch up with me eventually and just makes me deeply hate myself.

But after those two weeks, it was like all the negative feelings just came pouring back. I can't work. I can barely think. I feel better when I'm in therapy or a meeting but almost as soon as I leave all I want to do is smoke to stop feeling. To be able to sleep. To just... have a break. And if I can't work like this anyway, why am I putting myself through it? If it's not the weed, and just my mental illness, maybe I just need to give up on this career I've wanted all my life and get an easier job where I can smoke all the time and feel okay...

I know it never helps to compare yourself with other people, but I listen to all the people in group and in the rooms who have around the same amount of time as me, and they all seem like they're doing so much better than me. I have so many people helping me, I'm putting so much time and energy into this... why can't I feel better? Am I just too broken? I was miserable for the first \~20 years of my life before I found weed, why did I think it would be different 10 years later coming off of it?

In any case, sorry this post is so long -- I've been thinking about writing it for a few days now and just needed to vent I guess. I really want to stay sober, I'm just so scared that it won't get better for me. I miss feeling numb. Thanks for reading and I'd love to hear if you have any thoughts or support.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968132376670837}"

I stopped smoking around 2 or 3 days ago after I realised my tolerance was crazy high and I had to smoke a LOT to feel much at all (but at the time I assumed the strain I had was just weak, because I was getting high just fine a couple days before). 

The final time I smoked, I had an anxiety attack that lasted around 3 hours, and since then I've been filled with anxiety and incredibly strong derealisation. I sleep about 8 hours a night but the quality is terrible, waking up every 2 hours etc. I'm not having much trouble with eating, but I do sometimes feel dizzy and nauesous. I'm also getting tired much earlier in the day than usual. Headaches too. 

I've gone through periods of smoking a lot and suddenly quitting before and have never experienced withdrawals, and I'm worried that maybe this is something more serious? Or maybe I just pushed myself too far for the first time?

Showers make me feel much better until I have to get out, but the anxiety and derealisation are almost unbearable :(

Are these normal symptoms? How long will they last? I can handle the poor sleep and dizziness, but the anxiety and derealisation are so overwhelming and scary, especially living by myself with nobody to talk to. 

The symptoms come in waves too, I'll feel relatively normal (besides the derealisation) and then an hour later feel anxious and dizzy again.

I've recently decided I should stop smoking weed after my depression has suddenly started getting worse. I'm also going to be moving back in with my parents after Christmas as I lost my job in June and can't afford to live with my friends any more. They are very anti-weed and will probably throw me out if I start smoking, so this is my only option really.

I wanted to start mental health therapy through a UK organisation called IAPT. They helped me a lot when I was younger - I was suicidal after breaking up with my high school girlfriend and it really helped me, but I was also smoking weed to numb the pain. As much as some of you may disagree I think in part weed saved my life because it gave me an hour or two where I would feel at least slightly happy.

IAPT have refused to help me this time because of my weed addiction and they say it will counteract the behavioural therapies they want to try with me. They asked me to get in touch with an addiction centre first and sort out my weed dependence. I understand this but felt very angry and resentful at getting turned away.

The addiction centre have been really supportive but obviously their speciality is not mental health support. I've gone a week without smoking now but I'm completely miserable and questioning why I'm even trying to be happy.

The headache and appetite loss stage has subsided, but I hate being alone with my own thoughts. I've been having vivid dreams of a girl I never got over from university and it crushes me. I can stop myself thinking about her, but when I have dreams I have no control. 

My view on life has become so pesimisstic. I can't seem to stop myself drinking more now or watching violence, gore and death videos. I wonder if I'll ever be truly happy again as I was with my high school girlfriend. I know I shouldn't link my happiness to a girl but that was when I was truly happiest.

I feel like I will have to fight depression my whole life and that seems agonisingly daunting. What is going to happen when my mum dies or my cats that I love so dearly? I will be so crushed I feel like just giving up now before I have to suffer more of life's perpetual misery.

I've gotten over pretty much every common withdrawal symptom aside from having next to no appetite. It's been almost a month and I can still barely eat anything. I'll feel hungry, take a bite or two, then my stomach turns and it becomes difficult to even get water down. Is this common for heavy concentrate smokers? I read around online it should have lasted 1-2 weeks but its nearly double that timeline. I consume maybe 800 calories per day, not even close to enough for me as I'm a 200lb guy. I've also noticed some foods taste horrible, even food that other people find delicious is disgusting to me. I did dab 1/2g daily for around six months straight and I did dab before every meal so it kind of makes sense.

It’s really hard to quit cold turkey, and good job to anyone who can do it!! if you struggle with quitting cold turkey like I definitely do, try smoking less and less everyday! I went down from at least 20 tokes a day to 1 every other day, which made the physical side effects less intense. of course it’s different for everyone, but for someone who has been trying to quit smoking for over a year and a half.... it really helps. my mental health was being affected by weed for a long time, but I also smoked as a way to escape the way I truly felt. now, I’m trying to address these problems head on rather than smoke them away. 
to anyone struggling with stopping, YOU GOT THIS. I truly believe in you. whatever you put your mind to you can achieve. please remember this!! it’s important to take care of your mind and body, weed has it’s positive effects, but if you have an addictive personality it could be dangerous. 
stay strong, and stay toke-less!!! you guys can DO IT!!!!",8,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9980054497718811}"

Iam going to make it 6 months in 10 days ... is this a valid count ? 

should i restart the count every time i slip ? 

I've passed the withdrawals i guess ... but still feeling a lot of void on my days off ... weed was filling everything ... and making boredom and lack of achievement seems okay ... but now it's stressful ..

maybe i didn't slip on the first months as i was very aware of the consequences and the hell i had to go through ... 

I am trying to stay on the right path as hard as i can ... life is sort of stressful ,,, like really .. i have problems...

I dabbed rather frequently but the majority of time was smoking flower out of a bong or bowl. Freshman year I smoked almost daily and was blown away by the dream like state weed induced. Sophomore year I developed full blown panic attacks and vomiting from weed while smoking on a couple occasions but I persevered. This is when I began to notice social anxiety and being depressed. Likely tied to poor academics as well. Junior year, smoking was fun in my own apartment but I had turned into a person who feared social outing. Senior year I knew this stuff was only hurting my academics as demonstrated by my poor grades and school effort as well as highly introverted personally, but I still smoked. Week long t breaks during my senior year showed me glimpses of what I could be.

I stopped after a fresh heartbreak and a return to my hometown in March, when COVID started. Looking back, this combination of events was a blessing in disguise. I look back occasionally when noting my monthly milestones and realize from an introspective perspective that my whole persona has changed. When interacting with people, I sometimes recall old paranoid thoughts of social interaction. ""I would usually be afraid of what to say at this moment"", or ""it's so interesting that I'm NOT overthinking this person's facial expressions"".

I want to share my story full of failures and false hopes, because I bet many of you can relate to it. I started smoking 5 years ago and never had a break from smoking longer than 1 month. I really enjoyed smoking but nowadys I have a constant feeling of exhaustion and fatigue. So with the beginning of the year 2020 I was very unhappy with my life, because I realized that I started to neglect everything in my life including my family, my friends, college and work. I also realized that i would loose everything if nothing changes. So I had a strong motivation to really change things but there was one problem.  
Do you know the one guy who keeps smoking every day for years but still manages to get all his shit done ? Yeah thats my friend. So if he can do it, i can do it too right? I just need to control or limit my weed usage like him and everything will be fine. So for the past 11 months I really tried everything to control my addiction. For example I  set rules to myself where I would only smoke in the evening or weekends or to special occasions etc. This was fine for a few days maybe a week but after that  i was back to smoking all day long.  
Now after 11 months of failures and no changes and being closer to loosing everything that I have neglected, I finally realized that I am not my friend or a person who can do it both smoking and having a good life. So today is my first sober day but with the intention of quiting weed not only for week or till weekend but hopefully for ever.

So quick about me;
Born, dad moved out raised by too young a mum who didn't have time for me in her attempts to get a degree though my childhood, very poor and a bit autistic bulied for it for a number of years 
Saw mum almost dead from being passed out through alcohol multiple times, other childhood trauma 
Very few friends in or out of school and low self confidence until about 15 (which came back not long after)
Get a stepdad who hates me and causes a lot of home stress just when starting to make friends through being myself
Essentially bullied at home, try weed and aren't too fussed by it but use to get some kind of social contact  for the next 10 years, the last 4 of which have been prety solitary 

Find out to have a daughter on the same day stepdad kicked out and start having 'issues' 
To to uni under daughters mums advice to 'better provide for her in future', reluctantly go along but very depressed and very fat, go to lessons until christmas break and when I returned to city not go to lessons and just see the girl I was seeing at the time as she seemed worth it but she never trusted me which led to us falling apart 
Spend a long time after uni in crappy job single and depressed 
Find someone I'm intetested in but in relationship so eh
So do another crappy job that doesn't help mental health when the Corona strook 
Mental health sick leave for a long time during the pandemic
Smoked a shameable amount of savings 
Toward end of pandemic above mentioned girl really messes with my heartstrings 
Start another crappy job that I started to enjoy then they've moved me to something that I hate 
I'm smoking a LOT and I don't know if its in response to me being so depressed or a symptom of me being so depressed 
Whoever said 'it gets getter' didn't forsee the Corona outbreak 
But I'm breaking down, I've tried therapy, weed is relaible but it doesn't help me any more and I can't afford thr amount I'm smoking
What do I do? 
I'm heartbroken, damaged frim childhood, damaged from adult relationships, distant from my daughter and family and I hate my job in a shit economy and all I've done today is smoke 12 joints before dinner time
I know I have a problem but I don't have anyone to talk to about anything, I feel so lonely and idk if its because of the weed 
I just honestly don't see my life getting any better so I think its more acceptable to smoke than feel the way I do without it 

But everything is affecting everything, realistically I'm a decent looking guy but I don't really have the self confidence to share myself eith social media 
Also recently started sertraline 

But yeah if I say any more I feel like I'd be talking in circles, but have any of you guys been through similar stuff? Any advice? Thanks in the mean time",3,"{'rona': 2, 'pandemic': 2}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994413256645203}"

I've been lurking on this sub for about a year reading stories here and there but never fully taking them in, I'd read puffing away pretending I was different, until recently, think I've had my epiphany, or not?

I now realise I have an addictive personality possibly my whole life, I'm always striving for a high or some sort, that rush of dopamine, instant satisfaction I crave it deep in my soul. But now I realise I'm just empty inside. Context, been smoking 8 years almost daily since I was 15/16 now I'm 24f with nothing to show for my life, I went to college but skipped out on university cause I was unsure of my career path and what I actually liked doing. 

It's just dawned on me today maybe idk who I even am? my whole adulthood has been a blaze, literally, I've given up 4 months max in maybe 2017? I'm not even sure my memory is so bad :L and that was for a bf who refused to kiss me if my breath smelt like tobacco/weed even after brushing/mouthwash etc. 

I kinda enjoyed those months, I saved so much money, but eventually I treated myself why not it's Friday High day! then I was hooked again smoking maybe 10g a week idk, maybe not as much to some but for me yes.  

I always make excuses that I'm always broke though I have money to live (I just budgeted my weed into it and would rather have than other things) so I'd find myself round the 20th of the month with friends asking me to come out for dinner and drinks and think how the hell will I afford that?? that's a sad existence. I can't do my driving lessons cause it's like £300 for 10 lessons and I'd rather sit at home smoking watching law and order and guessing who the murderer is than socialising.

I had my last joint Thursday night, and I'm mentally preparing for what withdrawal brings, not looking forward to it though lol, but I want to start living not just existing.

so I call this day 1/2 cause I'm still not there with deleting numbers of dealers and throwing out all my smoking stuff but I want to get there, because the anxiety of sleeping without my nightly smoke is seemingly unbearable, so now its 4am again with minimal sleep (2hrs sleep yesterday then to a 15hr shift) but I haven't smoked tonight.



TL;DR I want to quit, don't want to substitute my weed addiction with other bad addictions. Any motivational books out there about this as reading used to be a big passion of mine, might help, or any stories/motivation will help. Thanks",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985711574554443}"

I decided five days ago I was going to quit Cold turkey and I want to help individuals who feel they two are also dependent on marijuana.
Marijuana isn’t a bad thing but if you do too much of something then obviously it’s not good for you. We shouldn’t drink alcohol every day so why should we smoke weed every day?
I’ve been feeling random muscle aches especially in my left arm that radiate to my hand. I was curious if anybody else have felt the same symptoms?

I can't believe I'm finally here. I can't believe that the last time I smoked weed was 10/31, my birthday. I have eaten edibles (20mg, and 30mg) twice since, but have resisted the temptation thus far about buying more weed, a new vape pen (I have bought and huffed my brains out, decided I was done, and thrown away a pen device probably 10x over at this point) or dabs.

Adding up all the $ I have roughly spent $25-30k on marijuana products if I had to guess. I could have literally had a house or put myself through graduate school by now. I could've done a round the world trip traveling with that money. 

This is not some side activity or thing I do occasionally or socially, it is a fucking addiction. I am one of the unlucky few, one of the ""10% of people who become dependent chronic users"", and I should've known because I do have a habitual personality. I overdo anything I like until I damage my serotonin receptors from doing it so much. (binge eating disorder as well)

My journey started when I was 15. I wanted to try weed. It was out of curiosity and wanting to be a little ""bad"" push out of the box a bit, at my Catholic school and chaotic family. No surprise from my childhood that I have a messed up personality and abuse things. Alcohol has been a similar issue, but still nothing like weed. 

I walked up to my bestfriend in the hallway and said ""I want to smoke weed, do you want to do it with me?"" We got our hands on it from some weird guy a year older, but never had to pull such strings again, as her older brother smoked and began to supply us. Mind you it was still limited and we had to be sneaky.  sophomore and junior year we experimented many times, a little in senior year too. But then we went our separate ways to different colleges and nobody at my school or in that state really had access or desire for marijuana. Drinking culture was big though, and when I hit 21 I started to incrementally fuck up my life with that substance as well. But that's now what we're here for.

So from about 17-23 I never smoked again. I started again when I moved to a new state that was very very weed friendly and my boyfriend at the time smoked. I hated it about him when we first got together and was very critical about it, but then we did it a few times together and my brain loved it. I loved getting high. then I moved to be with him and it became more regular. We were both so poor, but he'd always surprise me with an 8th and we'd share it, but it quickly lasted less and less and time. Toward the end of our relationship we were at a party and his friend brought out a rig and asked if I wanted to try wax, I was absolutely floored, shot to the moon, I was so high and I loved it. that was the true start of the downfall. 

We broke up some time later and I spent most my time and money buying weed and dabs and just getting high. Not focusing on work or trying to level up in my career or health or social life. I sat alone home and bored and lonely just getting high. 

I have turned off many potential partners because of this habit, and attracted other just party fuckboys for this reason. The habit is no longer cute, and I hate what it has done to me mentally and physically. I don't like who I am when I'm high, I'm worthless and my anxiety and paranoid heightens, but I continued to do it. 

Now I'm 29. I think about buying more the last few days constantly, but I'm trying to keep it together. I hate feeling enslaved and trapped, and the only way out is to stop. To develop some self control and to get stronger against this temptation. If it wasn't weed it would've been something else, and intermittently there were other things sprinkled in, but dabs kept me hooked. I'd still kill right now to have a fat dab and lay down and let the room spin, I know that's not a normal craving. Writing this makes me want to go to dispensary right now. I need some support, friends who smoke do not understand this, and friends who don't smoke also have no way of understanding this.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977272152900696}"

2020-11-13 12:59:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jtkndq/the_first_48/,The First 48,"Hey everybody, I've been a lurker here for a few months now but finally pulled the trigger this week and got rid of my stash and started working on developing those habits, routines and attitudes that will help keep me on my chosen path. 

I was a regular smoker, with no break longer than a day or two for about 10 years now, and for the past four years its been a daily part of my routine. I held my shit together, coming as close as one can to being a functional addict, but even in the midst of that I knew that smoking was in large part to blame for the areas of discontent and frustration I had about myself and my life. 

I have of course tried to quit multiple times over the years, and those attempts were pretty much the only breaks my body had from smoking over the years. Yet inevitably the craving, the wanting, the fear would drive me back. Its embarrassing, it feels like addiction is supposed to be reserved for the ""hard drugs"" and if I cant handle weed then I'm just some weakling who should stop my complaining. After all, I haven't sold my shit to pay for weed, I haven't stolen from my family to finance my addiction. Yet I have made more poor decisions and bad choices than I care to count, both to provide for my habit and to protect myself from having to come to terms with its true impact on my life and those I care about. And while I may not have done terrible things in pursuit of my habit, I have lied and hidden my relationship to using and how often I do use, from everyone. When you have to hide how often you are getting high, when you have to pretend you are just ""tired"" or ""not feeling well"" to explain your sluggishness and disinterest, then there really isn't much different between you and any of the other addicts, regardless of your ""drug"" of choice. 

I have spent the last three years developing many good habits and trying to inject positive, constructive and wholesome ideas and practices into my life. Picked up meditation, have a daily gratitude journal, use my journal/planner to make sure I'm staying on top of my shit, read 10 pages of a good book daily, prioritize giving time and attention to my relationships, spending quality time with my dog and so on. And all these are good things, that have had tangible positive effects on my well being and overall headspace. 

Yet weed was always there, waiting for me to start on a binge where I wouldn't engage in those habits, when I wouldn't take the time to do the small acts of daily discipline that I knew were moving me closer to the place that I really wanted to be. My problem with drugs was linked also to my usage of porn and video games, and once the binge started it was like getting trapped in a vortex. Use, feel pain and remorse about using, use more to hide from the pain, continue on until such levels of shame and regret coalesced that I would find myself pulled violently from my binge and placed back on the path towards my best self. 

I know for some people weed, porn and video games are not a problem, and I wont demonize them. Yet I have come to realize for myself that I simply cannot use them responsibly. In the book ""Recovery"" by Russel Brand he says something to the effect of, ""When I started using I wasn't sure when I would get control back, or what sort of state my life would be in when I did."" This struck a note in me as it seemed to sum up my relationship to using and binging and the guilt that followed. Eventually I would wake up and realize ""This is not what I want for myself,"" but in the time it took me to come to my senses how many opportunities did I flake out on, how many responsibilities did I ignore, how many times was I a dick to my wife or my dog or my friends, how many times did I let a problem fester and rot? Whenever I came back it felt like I was spending days or weeks just putting the pieces of myself back together. And even in the midst of that reconstruction, I was still smoking, still justifying it by saying it was the binges and the lack of engaging with my life that was the problem, not smoking in and of itself. 

Part of what makes this whole struggle worse is the fact that I'm a moderate asthmatic. Weed has never been ""good"" for my lungs, but it also hasn't really seemed to make them ""worse"" in any measurable way. Yet in the age of covid its impossible for me to ignore the studies that show that habitual weed usage is linked to dramatically worse covid outcomes. As an asthmatic who works in healthcare it makes NO FUCKING SENSE for me to still be smoking or using at all. Yet the combination of anxiety, dread and fear has made it feel like I have no choice but to smoke, despite the fact that I know it only makes the situation more perilous and dangerous. To the point where my wife has made multiple comments about the fact that she wants me to stop, wants me to protect myself, and the guilt of betraying that trust is just one more nail in the heart that I want to hide from by getting high. Explain that bit of logic to me, cause I can't wrap my head around my own stupidity. 

But This past week I went on a personal meditation retreat in the mountains, and spent a great deal of time reflecting on what using has become for me. Its not the ""chilling with my homies"" thing that it used to be, its not even about ""relaxing"" but instead its become about feeding the beast, about quieting that small incessant voice in the back of my head that tells me, ""If I were high, this would be better right now."" And in a fit of rage I tossed my stash off the edge of a mountain. I later climbed down to get it, but only so I could put it in a dumpster instead of littering. 

There isn't much that can mark this occasion of ""flushing the stash"" as compared to those in my past, nothing except my intention to make this time different and a few bits of luck. I just moved to the city I'm living in back in July, and thanks to Covid I haven't found a dealer here and have been intentional about not seeking one out. I live about 2 hours away from my family, and I was relying on my brother to be my plug, but he just moved halfway across the country. So for the first time I don't have easy access too weed, but I know this isn't enough. I've driven hours before just to get to a plug, spent more money then I care to count and spent more time in a car then I want to remember just to reach that place where I could get some grass. 

And so I'm here, pouring out what's left of my tattered soul to a bunch of other users on reddit. One thing my struggle with drugs and addiction has shown me is that in Isolation I cannot remain sober. Without community the voice of craving, the desire to hide from pain and discomfort, the shame and guilt about being less then I could be, all will eventually drive me to crack and use again. I've reached out to one of my best friends to create an accountability partner, I've spent time cultivating ideas and practices to help keep me centered, and I've made it my priority to take this one day at a time. 

And now I'm past the first 48 hours and it fucking sucks. I worked 15 hour shifts the first two days of my sobriety, and to be honest the crazy schedule helped to keep me from realizing that I hadn't used, or how bad I wanted too. But now its friday, and I have the day off. And that small voice is back, saying I could drive the two hours to hit up one of my old plugs and ""reward"" myself with a night of indulgence. I'm sitting here at 11 in the morning and the only thing that keeps playing over in my head is that ""There is a whole day ahead of me, how am I supposed to endure it without getting a little high?"" 

Thing is I KNOW this voice is fucked, I know its logic is cancerous and flawed, and I know that I don't want to do it. But that doesn't quite the voice, doesn't lessen the weight in my chest. I know I wont use today, cause I CAN get by without it. But FUCK. This sucks. So instead of driving the two hours, I'm sitting here writing this out so I can at least distract myself from the craving and desire to just say ""fuck it' and use. But I wont use. Not today.

It’s almost as bad as that feeling when you get blackout drunk and say and do a bunch of stupid shit and are filled with regret the next morning. Anyone else suffering in this manner? It’s torture. Yesterday was day 4(ish) for me, and I felt pretty good most of the day, but then my husband mentioned how he discussed me quitting weed with his friend and that I should’ve tapered instead of going cold-turkey. I flew into a paranoid rage because I didn’t want them talking about me behind my back.  I was irate because I’m going through so much agony, and I didn’t want to hear, “Tapering would’ve been better.” If I had the ability to taper, I wouldn’t have let my tolerance get as high as it did. I’m addicted and CAN’T TAPER. Anyway, we got into a heated argument that turned into me telling him all this stuff that bothers me about him. He felt totally attacked. I woke up this morning wishing I could’ve controlled my emotions better. But I feel SO OUT OF CONTROL. It sucks, because I’d been going to therapy for a few months and was really making headway with self-care, self-love, trying to create better thought habits, etc. And now everything feels wrong and my brain is trying to sabotage all the progress I’ve made. I HATE THIS! I’m so angry and paranoid and I just want someone to tape my mouth shut until I’m done with these withdrawal symptoms, so I don’t do any lasting damage to my relationships. Blerrrggh.

I don’t want to go back, and it hasn’t been difficult at all to abstain.

I've tried quitting weed so many times in 2 years (I've been smoking weed for almost 4 years).When I don't smoke I start to get really ANGRY ! i don't know where it all comes from.

I have issues dealing with my emotions, with a diagnosis of BPD (now called EUPD).

I'm actually pretty scared of my anger because I can have some pretty intense meltdowns with suicidal ideation/attempts. I am currently receiving therapy (DBT), but my therapist hasn't been able to see me in two weeks.

At the moment I'm having withdrawals from reducing how much i smoke to less than a quarter of the amount. But why drag it out? I want to quit now.

I am finding I can't STAND company or someone being in close proximity to me. I can't stand being spoken to and I also become too hyper-sensitive to every sound, smell, light that it all feels inescapable. I do have ASD so I am sensory-sensitive. I have to wear ear protection almost all day.

Regardless, I want to stop using weed to 'numb' me. I so badly want to get to Day 1, for the first time ever. I'm done with smoking and don't even enjoy the experience anymore.

I'm also nervous that I'll get through the rest of the day without smoking, and then tomorrow I will not be able to resist. I have to start somewhere and I want to start changing my life now.

Does anyone have any advice how to deal with anger/ get to Day 1?

I really wish you to see this situation with the same eyes as I do right now, so you can realize how bad it is affecting you.

Truth is, if you are here, it means you already have that inner side you screaming to stop, but you just lack this extra motivation or reason to do so, so maybe who knows, my situation can be similar to yours and this can wake you up somehow, I would be super glad if it did so!

&#x200B;

**So who am I? Why did I stop?**

I'm a 23 college student that also works part-time, and I'm not the average guy that would smoke a toke or another once in awhile.

I smoked regularly since my 17/18 and since quarantine started I got myself into this shitty cycle of smoking more and more and unconsciously and the less I noticed, I was already an heavy user that was burning 5g each 2 days. I was in this shitty cycle of being high 24/7, when I was waking up until I would fall asleep.

I wasn't able to save money anymore. I wanted to go to restaurants, I wanted to travel, be normal, but I felt myself trapped, where every single penny that would land in my pocket, my brain would automatically see it in grams quantity that I could smoke.

I noticed myself way more greedy, with a worse personality, someone that was really extroverted, I just wasn't anymore, I wasn't myself anymore. I would skip classes to go with my car to some spot, be on my own, listen to music and just burn some. My life didn't have any meaning, any purpose anymore, I wasn't achieving anything at all, I was living in a bubble where I was literally just surviving with the only desire of burning more and more weed.

I started seeing how severe my situation was, when I started feeling lonely, and I had my exams at the door, and my brain was just literally ""fuck everything, let's smoke the problems and the stress away"". I would stress out because I know that I should study, and focus on my future career, but then weed was literally killing any motivation and making me super lazy, and after I would realize that I should study, I was getting stressed, but guess what, I would smoke so I could reduce my stress, but then I was seeing myself even more fucked because I should have started way before, and again, puff puff pass pass. And that's how the cycle started.

I got to the point where I thought that I was supposedly making something that I loved and made me happy (smoking), but after all this years, and this months of heavy smoking, I felt like I did nothing, time just flew, and it was just nothing but an illusion. I felt a hole in myself, this lack of realization, this lack of satisfaction still. Why? Because I chose the easy way, the instant satisfaction, and real satisfaction comes from hard work and sweat, which I wasn't doing. I asked myself, is it that image that I would like to pass to my future kids? A motivationless dad that just cares about smoking? That probably can't provide a decent life for them or for myself because I make weed my priority?

I came to the conclusion that I had to make a decision NOW, stop giving myself excuses, stop waiting for tomorrow, I had to stop now if I wanted to make a change and some positive impact on my life.

I tried to stop few times in the past, but for you to succeed in this, you really have to not only want, but realize how bad it is affecting you. Judge your life, with and without weed, and imagine what you could possibly have done if you didn't spend all that money on weed, all those infinite hours smoking and spending those hours on useless shit such as netflix, or bla bla bla

I knew that it wouldn't be easy, and **trust me**, it's not!

Note, I don't want to demotivate you in any way, I'm just trying to be 100% real in all of this, and not lie to you!

I didn't sleep shit for some nights, I had vivid and weird dreams, in the first 2 days my body kept asking and craving for a smoke, and it was even worse because I realized how I finally had so much free time, so much free time to think about it.

That's right folks, it's been exactly a week **today** since I stopped and threw everything away (I think it really helps), and since then I've been trying to replace the bad habits with the good habits, such as eating healthier, practicing sports, focusing more on my projects and etc

And after this week, I can finally feel this **satisfaction** that I've been craving and describing above!

I promise you guys, this feeling of overcoming an hard situation makes it all up for everything.

The truth is, we can't be the kind of people that starts whining and bitching around, and let some fucking substance control us, **we control the substance**!

I love weed and all of the things it done to me when I was feeling hopeless, but it's time to grow, it's time to evolve as an human being, it's time to self develop in the good way.

I believe all of you have the potential inside you that's being wasted because you're letting weed affect your life for the worse.

I promise you, the first 2 days are hard, the rest will come way easier. After a week you will start to know yourself better, you will see money finally growing, you will see that you're finally more outgoing and not scared of being in social gatherings. And all of that in just in less than a week, imagine what kind of impact it will have when we are mentioning years.

If you need to let it out and talk this through, I'm here, just trust me in this, trust the process, and greatness will come.

I hope this can motivate you somehow, I just wish I had found this community before, it had a huge impact on me, seeing how other people changed for the best after stopping, because trust me, you will only change for the best afterwards.

And just one more thing, don't be scared of changing, **embrace the change**! You will be surprised.

Days are getting easier to manage. I had my birthday on the 11th and it was a pretty good day. I forgot all about my withdrawal side effects because they were hardly there! It was nice to be totally present and in the moment for the whole day. 

I'm still experiencing derealization and anxiety. But not all day long. They only pop up when I'm dealing with stress, and that's okay. I'm just learning how to manage stress without the pot now and that's why it's happening. It all makes sense if you break it down, and once you fully understand it, it's not as scary anymore. I guess like most of you said, just understanding it's there, but it won't be forever. 

I found covid to be a big trigger for me, so I've had to distance myself off social media. People are awfully mean right now, and the stresses from life being so far away from what our normal was only a mere year ago are very anxiety riddling at times. I'm having a hard time coping with it, but really, who isn't right now? I think we all miss that taste of normal life. Sigh. 

Hopefully we won't be stuck in this world too long, and people who are really struggling, like most of us, can get a break in soon. 

We are also moving to a new home tomorrow. I can not wait. I'm hoping a new start is exactly what I need. My current home hasn't felt like my sanctuary since our son died here. I don't know how I will feel once we leave and settle in, but I'm hoping it's better than I currently feel now. 

Anyways, lots of feeling sharing. I hope it can help some of you. If you saw my first post, you'd see that change really does happen and it does get better. You won't stay stuck for very long. Chin up friends, you're all doing great in a world that's scary and dark right now. You're one hell of a brave soul if you can throw your crutch away through this storm.

I’d been really struggling with my living circumstances: my partner made the decision to move back to Australia (I live in London, UK) in case anything happened to her family and now they’ve shut the borders - it’s been 9 months since I’ve seen her and will be another 6 at least; I’ve started a new job and that’s been all from home so don’t have any social connections at work and feel isolated and lonely whilst also struggling with the increased responsibility and workload. 

I’ve been numbing out daily after work and nearly all day on the weekends. 

I have been trying to cut back/quit by coming up with superficial rules like ‘only on weekends’ or ‘only on days I’ve worked out’ but never ever kept to them. I decided enough was enough and I just needed to STOP. whilst I’ve cried every day from the suppressed anxiety and depressive moods that have been coming up, I know I’m doing the right thing for myself and also the people around me. 

I discovered this page on day 1 and it really encouraged me to know that I’m not the only one who has this struggle.

I know there will be days coming up where I just want a spliff but I’m trying to come up with alternative coping mechanisms like meditation and putting in more time into my passions.

Over a number of years I’ve grown more and more dependent on weed for what I told myself was to help sleep and just relax but in retrospect was obviously masking deeper seated denial of my emotional self.

By any objective measure I could easily convince myself that I am more than acceptably functional on weed, I’ve got a great job that I can do easily even when high, plenty of money, and two amazing kids that I am a good parent to even when high, and an awesome wife though if I am being honest weed has been a strain on our relationship.

I’ve always been somewhat able to tow the line on moderation but it always seems to creep back up on me and I find myself using more often than not and telling myself it is helpful in making me relax and get sleep when I now see it has been insidious and actually making these issues worse.

I hope the mods don’t delete this part as it was an important piece of my journey but I started by trying to cut back and had some moderate success there before realizing that I was just bargaining with myself and doomed to a vicious cycle unless I just totally get rid of it from my life.

It was a couple months ago that I wrote the following in my Journal but I am finally at the point where I am moving on:

“I feel like I’ve let both myself and my family down by settling for stagnant comfort instead of striving to be my best self.  Finally acknowledging that there are bigger problems here and seeing myself this way for the first time I feel like the absurd punchline to a cruel cosmic joke and I hate it.”


I know from voraciously reading everyone else’s experiences how likely it is I could have a relapse and how I will probably feel great for a while and then have setbacks etc...

All that said I am one week clean and feeling better than I have in years, my energy is back, I’m not taking naps in the middle of the day, the low level constant brain fog is slowly lifting, and most importantly my motivation to actually confront and deal with issues in my life is slowly returning.  As much as I loved the way I felt and I could see the world when high I accept now that it was actually just making me numb and bland and that the awesome feeling I would get when high was like taking out a loan that I would inexorably have to repay with expensive interest.

I truly think my mindset has shifted fundamentally while accepting myself and the fact that I could backslide one or more times while still being committed to this journey.  I honestly think I am fucking done with weed though and will report back once I’ve got a lot more time under my belt.

The most important thing for my journey was finally realizing and and actually wanting to get weed gone FOR MYSELF and not for any external reason.  Keep up the fight fellow leavers, THC is an insidious drug that certainly has some benefits but can also sneak up on you over months and years and trick your subconscious into thinking it is helping in ways that it is actually hurting!",54,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8722439408302307}"

# Dear r/leaves users

Here is my story about me smoking for years, trying to quit and finally changing my life. I used this reddit when I was struggling with quitting so I've decided to come back here and share my story with you.

Btw. English is not my native language but I hope it's okay to read.

# Years of addiction

I was smoking almost everyday for about 8 years (from 16 years old to 24). I started smoking when I was at school. I've always had that state of mind that weed is so good, its nature, its healthy and you can't get addicted to it, however I've got addicted very quickly.

My life came down to smoking weed and playing video games, I've had only friends who smoked. If you were not a stoner - I had no business in being a friend with you. If you're a smoker but we can't get any weed - there's no point on meeting each other today.

I had a pretty decent job that time, I was enjoying it because I could smoke weed at break time and still do well (it was a telesales job so customer couldn't see that im high). I had a group of colleagues that were stoners as well. My earning were pretty good but it didn't matter at all, if I earned more money in given month than I would spend more on weed and fastfood.

I had a girlfriend - a stoner, all we did was smoking everyday...

I was studying at university but I left since I was smoking too much weed instead of studying so I couldn't make it through.

As you can see all my life was about weed. Movies about weed, music about weed, friends who smoke weed, girlfriend who smoke weed, smoking weed at work, smoking at university...

I've lost my driving license because I was driving drunk and stoned with weed inside my car...

At age 22 I moved to UK where basically you can get weed almost everywhere and earnings were so much better than in my native country. I went there to save lots of money as most of people from abroad do. Guess what? After 2 yers of being there I didn't save anything! All the money I had I've spent on guess what...

And same story again... friends who smoke, smoking at work, smoking all the time. The only difference was that me and my gf broke up.

Finally I've realized that my life is a big mess and all that mess is because of weed. I tried to change that...

# My attemps to quit

After about a year of being in UK I decided to quit weed. I remember I found r/leaves. I was reading a lot about quitting, about all the bad stuff that weeds does to you. I've realized that I have so much side effects caused by smoking for such a long time and not doing anything else.

I can't remember how many times I've tried to quit, but I was basically trying every single day.

I could wake up in a morning with a good mood, telling myself I won't smoke but few hours later I'd end with a join in my hand.

The more I tried to quit, the more I wanted to smoke.

At the end of me being in UK I didn't enjoy smoking at all, I remember I felt so bored when I was sober, but at the same time I felt very guilty if I smoked.

I've had enough... I felt I have go back to my country, live at my mom's house and try to get my things together.

# Trying to be a super human

When I came back to my country to live with my mother I decided to put everything on one card - I have to become a super human. I've started to read books, study, medidate, gym, swimming, running, rollerblading, diet, cooking healthy food, no weed, no cigarettes, no sugar, drinking only water. Oh god I was feeling like a god. I didn't even suffer from not smoking weed, I was getting so much motivation when I was seeing a progress of myself, I just stop smoking one day and start doing all these good things for myself.

I didn't have a single friend at this time, I've decided to break up all my relationships because all of them were weed-related.

Now I know that this is something about me - If I start doing something, I do it for 100%. But that's not always good, when I loved smoking I gave 100% of my life to weed.

When I started healthy life - I gave 100% of my life to that.

But after few months I started to quit my healthy life... I missed gym 1 day, than another day, than I ate junk food, than I smoked 1 cigarette...

Than I started to smoke 10 cigs a day, quit gym.

And guess what... I met with my old friends and start smoking again.

First I smoked only a few puffs, I was telling myself same lies that I've been telling like you know...

1 puff is nothing bad... 5 puffs is nothing bad...

But even if I took only 1 puff I had this feeling of being super guilty, I was feeling like everybody is looking at me - you know what I am talking about, I'm sure you have the same.

So I was meeting maybe once a week with my weed-related friends and smoked a bit. Every time before I smoked I was happy that I will see somebody, that few puffs is nothing bad and I will have a great time, but everytime after I smoked I had same guilty feelings, voice in my head was telling my that these friends are just a band of idiots who enjoy only smoking and we don't have anything to talk about if we're not high.

So I started to slowly quit again, but this time I didn't want to become a super human. I wanted to be a normal guy. I still smoked from time to time but very occasionally, maybe once a month.

At this time I met a woman...

# Family and university

We fell in love quickly, she became pregnant after about 2 months of our relationship. At this time I knew I don't want to smoke weed. I have to become a normal, responsible person, a good father and a husband.

She knew that I was smoking a lot in the past and she didn't accept it. She said that if I will come back to smoking than she won't be with me - it gave me additional motivation to never do it again.

Since then I didn't smoke a single time (almost 2 years now). But I wasn't a super human either.

I became the guy I've wanted to be - a normal, responsible guy, with great loving family.

At the meantime I started to study IT at university. I was really successful. I became that kind of student who always score A's, who sits in the first bench, always know all the answers. I even got scholarship because of my great grades!

# Career

Today I am changing my career - in 2 weeks im starting my first job as a software developer, in about a year I will get my It Engineer degree. I was working hard, learning everyday for about 1.5 year and my another dream came true, I will do something what I really love for the living.

# Future

I know I have to be careful. Temptation is everywhere. I don't even think anymore about smoking but I'm not going to any places where I could be around people who smoke. I'm not meeting with any of my old ""friends"". My whole life now is about my family and my career.

I know that If I would've smoked just 1 puff the story would happen again. I'm not telling I won't do it, I don't trust myself when it comes to weed.

Even that I'm doing so well in my life I still have lots of defects like a bit of overweight, lack of sport activity, lack of good sleep etc. But I'm okay with that. I know that at certain point I will solve these problems as well, but at the same time new problems will come, that's okay, that's what life is about...

# My advice

I think that quitting weed is not like a switch which you turn off one day and you stop smoking. After all that time I've realized that this is a process. Process of getting better everyday, of getting smarter and more overwhelmed. This is a process of learning to live with your past, to know what mistakes you've done and what are the consequences of it in your today's life.

Find something that gives you happiness, something which develops you as a person.

If you like drawing than get that 100 hours course about drawing, learn it, move on. Do something for yourself! Find your hobbies, your passion. Find out what kind of job you want to do in your life.

Find out something that will give you true fun, not like weed.

YOU HAVE TO PROGRESS.

Avoid all the bad stuff

2020-11-13 00:52:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jtbqbj/i_want_to_quit_so_bad/,I want to quit so bad,"Hey everyone! I've been smoking weed and tobacco together regularly since about Grade 12 and I'm 23 now. The first few years didn't cause too many problems because it hadn't become a ritual yet. I would just smoke with my friends and that's it. Now I can't function without being high and only made my anxiety and depression worse. After high school I went to college for radio broadcasting and that's when it got bad. I was blowing money on weed with the money that was supposed to go towards my well being. I dropped out and moved back home and worked solely for the purpose of buying weed. After my Grandma and Poppa died within months of each other from lung cancer, smoking started to become my ally. Woefully ironic. My time with my grandparents was cut short and smoking suppressed my grief and guilt. Retroactively it didn't and still doesn't. 

I never knew what I wanted to do after high school. I never took it seriously and coasted with passable to sub par grades. I rarely showed up for a full week. All I cared about was playing basketball and video games and eventually getting high. I couldn't fathom and didn't want to think about moving away from my sanctuary. When I went to college I came home every weekend. The only place I've felt comfortable being myself (my real self). My mom, sister and I are very close. Mostly because of my childhood, where (in short) I lived with people that made me and my sister wish that it would just be the three of us (and our cats). Our wish finally came true and we were finally free to be our own family. I didn't want to leave already after so many years of wanting to move away from my previous life. Anyway, there's two things I know I would rather be spending time on right now rather than smoking. Basketball and music. I've played basketball for half my life and my love for it only grew stronger. I was always one of the best players in school but my main passion wasn't really playing, it was analyzing and teaching the game. I've also always had a connection with music. I love to sing and I'm damned good at it (if I don't say so myself). However, I can't sing consistently without clearing the shit out of my throat. I also love animals and have a soft spot for them, as I have five cats. I would love to work with them.

Basketball and singing are my passions but there will always be that one thing to get in the way of my development and potential. You guessed it. Weed. I've no time for anything except for smoking. I wake up from my bed, go outside to smoke and then come right back to my bed to play video games and repeat. I've lost all motivation. This has been my life for a long time and it's really sad. I've wasted years of my life in my bedroom and I'm sick of it. I'm ready to live a normal life, but I can't without eliminating my greatest demon. I felt that the only way to get me to stop smoking and stop being a burden on my family was to die. 

When I'm craving, I become frantic. I can't do anything until I've smoked. From eating to even playing video games. I need to be high to enjoy what I'm doing. I've physically harmed myself to transfer the pain in my mind to my body. I've cut myself all over my body leaving multiple scars. I've smashed a mason jar over my head. My mom had an ambulance pick me up because she was afraid of what I'd do to myself without weed. I've left my house with the plan to not come back. I think I know what insanity feels like in a minor way. This is horrible shit that I've put my mom and sister through. Emotional blackmail. Seeing the terror on their faces, seeing someone they love hurt is horrifying, and I feel terrible for them. I haven't hurt myself in a while and I don't plan to. I feel like I've improved mentally but I'm still not where I want to be. I know I want to quit now when before, I never saw it as a possibility.

It's easy for me at night when I'm high to say ""Alright this is it. Starting tomorrow, I'm not smoking anymore."" I wake up and have nothing else to do. I've been unemployed since before covid and I can't and don't want to see myself working until I've improved my mental health and well-being. I also have had multiple crap jobs (like everyone) and want to see where I can push myself independently with my passions in mind. I want to stop smoking, eat healthier and work out all at once which would be difficult for anyone, especially for me. But that's just the way my mind works right now. Things need to happen immediately. Everything is too complicated and seems out of this realm to achieve. I always felt that I needed someone to push me in the right direction. I now know that it's ultimately on me. I just don't have the strength to push through. I have no confidence in myself because I've never personally developed it. I've been in the same rut since I was a teenager and I don't know anything else.

If anyone has any advice or words of encouragement I would appreciate it greatly. I'm proud and happy for everyone who has quit and is living a better life, and I hope to post about how many days I've gone without smoking soon!

Re: If there's anyone with a similar situation as me please let me know! I know this is a thread for sobriety advice and my post doesn't talk about my sobriety but I just wanted to get my story out there. Thank you everyone who commented!

First off I’d like to say I’m so grateful for this sub. It has made it possible for me to get this far! After 6 years of every day smoking this is the longest break I’ve ever taken, and I have no plans on going back.

First of all the difference in the flow of time still surprises me 4 months out! I know back when I was smoking every night I’d blink and a month had passed and I hadn’t achieved anything I want to.

Now I have the motivation to make a big career leap and move cities, something I’ve wanted for almost 2 years but could never seem to do.

It’s not all sunshine though. I’ve had to crack down on my drinking habits because they got out of hand to fill the space. Quarantine + drinking every day turned in to 20 pounds of weight gain.

Thoughts/learnings:
- I didn’t actually have social anxiety, weed gave that to me
- I don’t need as much alone time as I adamantly said I did (to avoid doing things so I could get high)
- I haven’t had any issues with acid reflux since quitting (because I’m not eating trash)
- speaking of eating trash, the stuff i used to consume on a regular basis grosses me out now
- my short term memory loss is basically gone 
- I’m dreaming SUPer vividly almost every night. Thankfully no nightmares 
- I am actually not a flaky person at all. Weed made me that way. Haven’t flaked in anyone since I’ve been sober 
- music is actually better sober 
- I’m not self conscious about people knowing I’m high or worrying I’m going to lose my train of thought (and then actually lose it lol). 
- I am much less emotionally reactive. My emotions used to go 0 to 60 when I was smoking so much, now I feel like I can handle things better, especially stress.
- food tastes BETTER now. I am able to eat in the morning and balanced meals every day 
- weed doesn’t make me creative, I am creative on my own
- I can breathe so much better and I don’t have a chronic hacking cough anymore 
- my motivation to workout and be healthy has returned 
- my relationship with friends and family are improving so much 
- I don’t look so tired all the time 
- I feel more like myself.. the person I was before smoking

With all this being said, it’s still a journey. I still deal with cravings and have to stay strong. But each time I make it through a craving, I feel more confident in my ability to stay sober.

Hi everyone, I’m on day 4 of not smoking and I’m using the Grounded app to stay on track. I really want to give it up for good. It just doesn’t feel as good as it used to. I also want to perform better in school, work, my relationships, etc. I kind of blame smoking and my reliance on it to numb the harder emotions and relax with my dissatisfaction now with where I’m at in life. It’s become much more a disruptive force in my life rather than a fun, momentary way of escaping that it once was.  
I wasn’t expecting all these crazy emotions to come up so soon after quitting. I’m not sure if this is an experience shared by others, because I know there is the physical side of it like insomnia or appetite change but I didn’t consider my emotions to be so heavily affected. I’ve been mainly struggling now with anger and sadness, over the littlest and biggest things in my life. Regret would be another major recurring thought. I don’t want to feel this way, but I also know numbing it with smoking isn’t the answer anymore. 
I was wondering if you had any tips or tricks that worked for you to balance yourself out or make yourself happier through it. I also am wondering for people who haven’t smoked for a couple months, when they really felt back to normal emotionally and if that’s even possible.

2020-11-12 15:01:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jt1yyn/looks_like_the_end_again/,Looks like the end again,"Hi fellow leaves,

Third topic since discovering this subreddit a few months ago.

My first topic was about me quiting and I did succeed for two weeks. Second topic was made the weekend I had my two week celebration. My friends and I were doing a citytrip to Rotterdam and I was asking how dangerous this could be: eventually decided 'what's the harm right?' and after that weekend I went back to smoking on a daily basis. 

So first of all my profile: 25M, high-functioning job, social life isn't what it used to be but i'm kinda fine with that. Used to be one of the more popular and known guys for most of my high school / university years and was kinda done with that. I used to be pretty OK in sports: one of the better on amateur level but that's gone to waste since starting to smoke. I've been smoking since leaving university 4 years ago on a daily basis. Never really quit for a period longer then a few days and that was mostly cause I had to travel somewhere for work or cause I couldn't find anything that was smokeable.

The two weeks I managed to quit in september where really important for me. I love the feeling I was starting to develop - regaining control of my once so loved brain. I had few withdrawal symptoms cause I knew how to deal with them. Only the nightmares were something to cope with - had a reoccuring one about a certain house with some paranormals things. Without going into detail. Last weekend I smoked alot of very good pot and I had the same dream. Just a random detail. I made sure I had a busy agenda and went so see alot of family and friends and really enjoyed that. Work was going great. I enjoyed gaming at a 'higher level' again. Long story short: those two weeks were amazing but I messed up and couldn't get myself strong enough to do it again.

But now I finally managed to find the strenght. Although, it's not strenght actually. It's necessity: I feel so depressed after smoking. Like really really bad but still I do it every single day. And the amounts aren't normal anymore. Think I'm spending like 500-600€ a month on it right now. I start skipping work (working from home so you can imagine what I do instead of work then). I don't enjoy eating if not baked AF and having junk food. I don't enjoy television anymore - not even while high. I don't enjoy music. I don't enjoy anything while high anymore. I just want to crawl under a blanket and have my 'high-nap'.

Anyhow: decided this pathetic way of being has to come to an end. If I read back my topic made when I was sober for two weeks I can't see why I relapsed. I'm gonna try again and not gonna give in - I don't want to say forever yet but for a while atleast since I proved there's no in between for me. That's all actually. Noticed It helped last time to type it out so trying that again.

Good luck to everyone out there and once again: 'it's better to feel pain, than nothing at all! We can and should do this. Let's take our pathetic little being and choose our sacrifice and bear it!",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9507300853729248}"

Don't get me wrong I know there'll be times when the cravings will return for a short while however I've 9 months worth of practice at ignoring them now so, I know I'll win. I've had the odd off day as happens in life and not once have I thought smoking will help. Other things did pop into my head which could lead to smoking but I ignored those urges too.

I must say I really felt like I was gong to be one of those people who had to go the full 2 years to beat PAWS, but I'm not, I'm one of the lucky ones. And God am I grateful.

I guess what I'm trying to say to anyone who *does* read this is, don't give up. You don't know when the tide will turn but as long as you keep going it will. Just keep adding those days.

I don't really get ""high"" anymore, just get relaxed, but I prefer it this way as I am able to do homework or read or workout. 

I have an interest to quit smoking regularly and save it for weekends. I'm worried about the affects on my health as well as chronic feelings of being tired and a ""muddy"" mind. I work FT and go to school FT and I feel tired all the time. I use weed to help me relax when I'm stressed, but I don't like the idea of having to rely on a drug to relax myself. 

I watched an interesting TED talk that stated that the opposite of addiction is connection, and this blew my mind. It's very true that I feel disconnected from ppl when I'm high. They can be directly beside me and I feel like I am a million miles away. I leave my home to go smoke and I miss my family when I'm gone. I can't get that time back. 

I also feel as if my mind is cloudy and it's more difficult for me to think and comprehend things sometimes. Then, on days when I haven't smoked yet, I feel surprisingly clear and intelligent, until I start the wake and bake. I have no energy once Ive smoked and it leads to a lazy day. 

When I'm high, I tell myself that I want to quit smoking. I'm not really enjoying the feeling, so what's the point of keeping up with the habit? Yet once I'm sober and craving smoking, I can't stop myself. 

I do believe I have an addiction, although some would argue that one can't be addicted to weed. I think of addiction as continuing to do something even though you know it's bad for your health and you want to stop. When you can't stop yourself, you have an addiction, and that's where I am now.

Long time lurker, first time poster.  I come to this sub for motivation, and in hopes of finding people with similar struggles and advice for my situation. This is a long post, but I hope some of you will read it and respond. 

I have been an everyday smoker for 5 years now and have been using for about 10 years.  The first 5 years of Marijuana use didn't seem to be very problematic and I had little issues with overuse. Once I got married and had my own house, I started smoking every day.  A couple important things to note about me is that I have struggles with severe chronic migraines for over 25 years. I have been prescribed countless different medications to try and help, but none of them were very effective. 

I started smoking when I had a headache or migraine and realized it would get rid of my headache or migraine about 75 percent of the time! This was a miracle for me. I experimented with different strains over the years and was convinced this was my miracle drug. I then decided to smoke multiple times a day to try and prevent headaches and migraines from happening. This helped but didn't solve the problem.  

Now I'm into a full blown ""addiction"" to my miracle drug. I spend a significant amount of money every month to keep my stash from running out, and my wife absolutely hates the smell and the fact that I use it every day.  She says she doesn't know who I am without it anymore and I am starting to wonder the same thing. I have struggled with depression and and anxiety as well and I feel like the weed helps somewhat, but it could also just be feeding the fire. 

I really want to take a break from the weed for a while to see how my body reacts and how I feel but I am terrified of the side effects of not using for me. I just can't stand having headaches every day and having the weed to help with the pain and nausea had been a blessing. However this is a double edge sword situation. My body and mind is super dependent on this drug, and I feel like I'm trapped. Has anyone dealt with something similar in the past? What worked for your situation? Is using occasionally even an option for me? I feel like I'm so dependent on it for my health that I cant function without it.

I have moved from smoking to vaping, thinking that this is somehow a step in the right direction, but have realized that my use has actually increased with this method, due to its' extreme convenience. The funny thing I've noticed over the past week is that THC is the best part of my low days (little energy, might not even get out of bed, shitty eating...etc.) and the worst part of my good days (feeling productive, doing things to take care of myself). Both of these kinds of days I end up going for the vape (it's habit), but I reach for it MUCH later when I've gotten out of bed upon waking up, made some food, and have done even the smallest tasks. When I do eventually reach for the vape on a good day, I quickly slip into a ""buffering"" headspace where it's difficult to see through more than a couple of tasks before I feel a pull towards the couch and a screen.

After falling victim to the addiction a number of times. The longest I have quit is 2 months. Each time during the time of quitting I feel amazing. But the craving and the desire leads me to smoking again. I immediately would regret it once I smoked. 

I got to a point where the high isn’t doing anything for me anymore. The moment I smoke, I instantly regret it.

It is not worth it! The fear of missing out is ultimately what I am dealing with.

I have major sweats at night, and since I decided to quit before shark week starts (ladies y’all can relate) my pms symptoms are going to be heightened!

One tip I noticed that got me to quit for 2 months last time. Was I constantly would come on to this thread and read. Seeing others who are doing it or have done it really helped keep me motivated on what my goal is.

Im 28 years old and I’ve held off asking anyone for any advice and help for a very long time... I’m just scared now, if it’s been too long...

None of my friends or family (they’re highly religious and would probably disown me if they knew) are aware of extent of my addiction, psych’s & doctor’s look at me like I’m a junkie (probably well justified), and my habit has got to a point where I’m high literally all the waking hours of my day,

I’ve been smoking every day for the last 10 years, to a point now I am at an ounce every 4/5 days. I can’t remember a time when I didn’t wake up to a bong. 

I never use to be an anxious person, but now I’m anxious about more things than I can name, I’m depressed about scenario’s that probably will never be, and I can no longer form meaningful relationships with anyone... I feel like, at least for the last 10 years, It’s had to be a 3 way relationship, me, you and my weed. Even going on a coffee date, I’d smoke before hand - and I can’t even tell you why,

My god... even writing that just sounds ridiculous...

I’ve worked really hard at my career (not a boast, just context) and have started to travel for work in the last few years, and, whilst I should be really excited about that. I’m not.. These periods have been the only time in the last 10 years where I’ve had any sort of break from smoking. 

I’m now ALWAYS nervous when I know I have any upcoming trips overseas because of the withdrawal, even just a few night’s interstate.

Every trip is like ground hog day... 

The first night I’m usually with clients and drink a copious amount of alcohol (from which I just black out and sleep), but from day 2 onward, when I have to work, I’m nauseous all day, can’t sleep... I’m sure you guys know all the symptoms. But, they kick in for me day 2, guaranteed, every single time I don’t smoke.

The longest I was clean was for 3 weeks while I was overseas but the withdrawal symptoms didn’t stop, I spent all the days when I didn’t have to work, sweating and throwing up in my hotel room...
I experience every single withdrawal symptom associated with stopping it, at a really really exacerbated level... for me personally though, the no sleep and nausea are the most debilitating,

I don’t want this to be the rest of my life, but I feel like this is who I am now. I don’t have any identity without weed. I’ve lost any sense of enjoyment of life and I’m worried about myself, as my thoughts get darker and darker about the future everyday. So I repeat the process... 

Pack a cone, smoke it. Then the cycle starts again.

I think, I’m really just asking for the reassurance, and advice, to see if anyone has smoked for this long, got clean (and not lost everything in the process), and actually enjoys their life again - 1 year/2 years down the track?

2020-11-11 15:20:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jsfwsd/its_been_five_weeks/,It’s been five weeks,"I began using cannabis at the age of 17, and within a few months, certainly by my eighteenth birthday, I became a daily user. Since that time, in the last thirteen years, I consumed cannabis nearly everyday. There were a few rare periods within that timeframe where I abstained for a day, a week; or even on a couple occasions, a few months.

Gradually my tolerance grew. But for the most part, I never considered it a problem. Just over a month ago, I basically used about a half ounce a week. I lost the majority of my employment with the pandemic in mid April, but for months I continued using regular amounts. Years ago I had gone through job changes before, being unemployed for a couple months, and it didn’t bother be that my savings all got smoked up. 

More and more this time, the financial aspect was pressing me, internally, to consider abandoning the habit. But use continued. After all, I wasn’t likely to be getting tested anytime soon. So I just blazed on; I let things slide. Totally messed up my unemployment insurance with my laziness; f if you know, just blaze it and whatever. 

Increasingly, I had this nagging feeling that this wasn’t sustainable. And so, in the beginning of October, I decided once my supply was diminished, I would go cold turkey. Of course, it would be better to have disposed of the buds and edibles etc around the house, but... that wasn’t gonna happen in my mind. Especially since I had gone through withdraw twice before and knew the difficulties I would go through. 

In previous times going through withdrawal, the symptoms were not easy to cope with.  Sleeplessness being the most troublesome; random bouts of sweating, coughs and phlegm for a month. Strong craving for weeks.  The sleepless would take about 2 weeks, followed by extremely vivid and often intensely scary nightmares; to the point where I was nervous going to bed, which lasted maybe a week or two. This time, I was heavily plagued by sleeplessness and the painful headaches it brought. After maybe 10 days my sleep schedule returned to normal. I have begun dreaming again (pretty much never did in the many years of use), but haven’t had the nightmares. I had a cough for about two weeks. And some hot and cold flashes/sweatiness (obviously worrisome symptoms in the covid era). This time, the cravings actually weren’t as much an issue. 

I think having gone through it before helped; I will say though, the sleeplessness and headaches were debilitating. I’d say I started feeling “normal” again after two-ish weeks. In previous experiences, I never felt fully committed to quitting for good; and when the appropriate moment presented itself, I started up right again. Of course I’d tell myself: “I’ll regulate. Only use in the afternoon. Not go to work high.” That would prove false within two days, max. I do not have the capability of regulating my use, period, even if in other aspect of my life I have self-control. 

So this time, I must recognize this fact. Part of me wishes, gee, wouldn’t it be nice if after all this, I could just blaze here and there; maybe twice a month; feel the good vibes, and just stay clearheaded the rest of the month? Kind of like my relationship with alcohol (not that I’ve never overindulge there; but I can have beer in my fridge for weeks and just pop one off when if feels right). You know what: it would be nice. Props to those who can regulate cannabis use in that way. I know I cannot. That first time again would bring me right back to the days of the wake-and-bakes and blazing all day, driving high risking legal consequences; etc. In a way I’m glad it was cannabis instead of alcohol or something else. After all I still consider myself “pro cannabis.” But, frankly, I must finally acknowledge: it’s not for me. 

With all that said: withdraw sucks. Certain symptoms can persist for even up to a month. The cravings can last much longer. Ignore anyone who belittles you for saying you have withdrawal symptoms. Those of us who have gone through it know they are real. Keep fighting and moving forward. Within a few weeks, you can regain “normal.” Hang in there!",19,"{'pandemic': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979172348976135}"

I do have friends who don't smoke weed when chilling, but do smoke baccy, which I don't want to pick up either.

This is the first post I have ever really made on reddit, but here goes! I am currently a university student and frequently smoke weed. Recently I have done a lot better in cutting down however find it hard to not give in. Everyone else in my house is a strong smoker so when I am also being offered it is hard to say no.

During the UK lockdown I felt like it was a good time as I do not smoke when not at university, maybe occasionally meeting friends for a spliff etc. It allowed me time to better myself in lockdown, as I am someone who does suffer from mental health and I am on SSRIs. I have even taken up gym (when opened) to improve my mental health which has worked so well. However, I have entered this loop again where I depend on weed and my withdrawals always feel so strong. The people I live with do not really understand mental health so cannot really tell when I am depressed as well as feeling anxious.

I was just wondering on the best way to quit, recently I have cut down a lot more than what I was smoking however giving in to temptations when drunk or sober just makes me worse again in the long term. So I came to this sub reddit for help and wondered how other people managed to quit. I want to get pass the stage of getting the withdrawals but with so much temptation around me I find it hard to quit, but I have noticed how much its ruining my life and ruining all my progress with my counselling.

If anyone had any advice or tips for me to quit for good it would really be appreciated and guide me in the right direction

Alcohol was the real problem for me. I drank daily for 10 years. At the beginning it was 2 glasses of wine a night. At the end it was bourbon every evening until I blacked out. 

At 31 I eventually became so depressed and anxious I couldn't function. I quit drinking. It took years to build up to quitting. Not gonna get into that.

I used to hate smoking weed... why would you smoke when you could drink and truly numb everything? I forced myself to learn to enjoy weed. It seemed like a perfect substitute. I heard from everyone weed is not addictive....... SURPRISE!!!!!! 

Fast forward 2 years and weed is just as destructive as alcohol to my life, in a different way. It takes away my drive to do anything. I still haven't built up sober time to process the trauma that led to the drinking in the first place. I need to. 

I've tried to quit weed 1000 times in the past 6 months and wasted hundreds of dollars flushing herb down the literal toilet when I can't take it anymore.

I have a feeling of restless creative energy and I have neglected my journal practice so I figured why not kill two birds...  


I'm 170 days clean today which is by some measure the longest I've ever been clean since starting to use weed at around the age of maybe 22 (I'm 31 now). I'm incredibly grateful to be clean and I feel as though that gratitude continues to be compounded on a daily basis. Reflecting now on the first couple of months of my recovery I can see the progress I've made in terms of my psychological affect and my level of neurosis. I was pretty damn anxious and crazy there... and far worse when I was actively using.  


Yesterday I received my acceptance letter for the Masters of Music Therapy. I've been wanting to and talking about applying for this degree literally for years now, telling everyone in my immediate circle that it was my plan and yet I could never get my act together to actually apply because I was always a mess because of my using. In actually submitting myself to the process of doing the application and the subsequent audition and interview a lot of feelings of inadequacy and shame were provoked, feelings and thoughts of the exact nature that I was medicating with my weed using. To be able to ride them out and not be completely derailed by them truly is a gift and it's a gift of recovery. I know without a doubt that I never would have gotten my shit in any way career-wise while being owned by weed and I know that I'll certainly fuck this opportunity up if I begin using again.  


I've written on here before that I've been attending NA meetings, gotten myself a sponsor and have started writing on the steps. I really do encourage everyone that is open to it to give it a go, if only with a purely experimental attitude. I never would have thought that NA would be for me, or that I would be suitable for NA, and there are certainly aspects of the program and literature that aren't for me, and yet it has been a hugely valuable resource for me staying clean and I frankly doubt that I would have been able to stay clean without it. I had a lot of reservations before trying NA, especially around the fact that my main drug was weed (I've gotten pretty strung out on coke and booze at various times, but nothing has ever owned me like weed has) and not a harder drug. My experience has been one of total inclusion, and the value of being able to relate to so many individuals from such disparate backgrounds seems an innately therapeutic experience to me. I don't necessarily subscribe to the disease model of addiction, and yet viewing through the lens of the addiction model forms for me a useful rubrick for me to enact in my life.  


I still have thoughts of using from time to time but thankfully they don't linger very long and having done a little bit of formal step work has been very useful for me in not entertaining these thoughts, as has my meditation practice.  


Anyway... I might just leave it there for now.  


Stay on the path guys, I'm still fairly early in, but it has been so worth it so far. There's no high that rivals experiencing life clean. Our time here is short, and I want to experience all of it, the good, the excruciating, and the excruciating dull.

I kept on going. I have Bipolar Disease and I take a lot of psychiatric meds, and smoking helped me a lot with the anxiety and anger I often feel. However I’m also a tobacco smoker and well I just felt that smoking weed was a much more nice smoke. But I couldn’t control it. I was smoking about a 1/4 ounce everyday.  And I was spending big bucks. I had savings to start a business. About $5000, and I just blew trough it.  Like it was nothing. And my job, almost every cent went to weed, and I also started consuming extasis, I consumed every weekend for 3 months. So moneywise I was in real trouble. Eventually I started getting loans, or stealing a bit of money every now and then. I knew I had to quit. But I couldn’t and it feels like shit to leave something you love. But I would smoke and 15 mins later I was sober again and I needed to smoke more. Eventually my mom talked to me in tears and told me she feared for me, she didn’t want me hurt and mix with the wrong people (she has already gone to rehab and met some interesting people, who she heard horrors from) and that she told: “I just can’t imagine what makes you hurt so much, you have to get high to escape. I wish I could heal you and care for you, and that you wouldn’t have to suffer.”  Man, that shit felt hard. I instantly flushed my stash. And after a first day without smoking I feel proud, yet scared. But that’s part of it. Just found this reddit, really loved seeing all the things people had to say. Hope we can all overcome this addiction.

Hello, I wasnt a heavy smoker, but smoked from time to time for 1 year. This august I got really stoner some nights. At the beginning of september mixed some alcohol with weed and probably got psychosis (distance from reality and anxiety).
Then, when I woke up everything was ok, but I stopped smoking and drinking at all after that.
Anxiety came all of a sudden in a month after this incident.
Talked to a doctor, however, didn't think that problems were caused by weed/alcohol.
Anxiety vanished, but slight depression and intrusive thoughts (suicide, etc) came.
Ive been swimming for around 3 weeks now and things are getting better, but sometimes I still get some thoughts or fog in my head.
When will this dissapear? Looking only forward.

Some tips that helped me:
1. Don’t expect to sleep. I didn’t sleep for more than An hour every night for the first week. But it gets better, this is truly one of the hardest parts, if you get through this - everything else is peanuts.
2. Eat. Small healthy meals, but eat. It’s very important and you will feel better.
3. Keep yourself busy. It’s hard during this time but try and be as busy as possible. I was too tired to have cravings, but I also kept myself busy with house work, games, friends and so on.
4. Don’t quit 15 things at once. It makes it much harder. I drink more coffee now than I did before, but it helped me to focus just on quitting weed.
5. Be social. You can go to MA meetings, post on this sub, it really helps to see and talk to others who go through the same thing. I have an instagram account where I document my progress and it really helps.

I'm  34 and have been smoking daily for 14 years (between 3-10g a day).  My  ""baseline"" or ""normal"" is how I feel after smoking my first joint in the  am.  I have aspergers (high functioning ASD) and have been self medicating for years as it was  doing a lot of good for me.  I've started to notice recently I'm  burning out a lot, and avoiding things I used to love participating in  (half Ironman, mountain bike, run, web design) to the point where I will  plan out a way to avoid the activity.  
Last weekend the wife and I  were going to go cycling but I purposefully left my shoes at home so I  would have to go back and get them and not join her on the ride.  I'm  attributing this to my cannabis consumption being too high, and  impacting my drive.  I also run my own website design business and  literally am watching it crumble in a time when it should be thriving,  and I cant bring myself to care.

Yes  this sounds like depression for sure, and thats partly why I was  smoking for so long...but Im worried Ive gone too far and my body just  rejecting it now.  I literally burn out 20 min after smoking Green Crack  which for the last decade has been my go to on the daily.

So  I've decided to take a break, and see whats going on so I at least have  an understanding of what ""normal"" is, and if I really need to smoke as  much as I do; and if it killing my drive/mood.   All this said, I'm  freaking TF out and literally joined this group and am typing this out  to kill the time before my local closes for the night.  I have this  crazy somatic sensory feeling going on, and my skin feels like its going  to crawl.  
I made sure I had nothing left in the house before I quit,  as this has been something I've wanted to do for a long long time but  keep failing.

Would love some  advice from those who have gone through this after smoking for so long  at such a high volume.  I literally plan vacations and trips out around  where is legal, and when I moved across the country we took a 5 day  detour to go to Colorado so I could grab as I was really becoming quite  an a\*\*h\*\*\*.

Sorry if I sound like a  baby or whiner, I just am lost and really don't have any friends around  me currently as I'm quite anti social and don't like talking about this  stuff openly; much easier behind a screen!

When I found this subreddit I got scared. It made me realize that change is coming and I wasn’t comfortable with it. Many of you guys are going through exactly same thing. This amazing plant from God that many people disregard as addictive. 

The first time I quit 2.5 year ago for 6 months was due to stressful event I was exposed to. Some may say I found my conviction. I resumed back ....

I left mentally draining me husband of 8 years.... 

This time I spent considerate amount of time reading this subreddit .. reading high as well. 

I reflected so much on my life and how weed held me back. Even with my career... 

So finally few weeks ago I made a conscious decision to use my son’s birthday as a reason to stop. 

I can say that a lot is in my head. I reached for weed at home many many times a day. 
My tolerance is so high it would probably put someone In coma lol 

I don’t have epilepsy, I am not palliative, I don’t have cancer, I don’t have anxiety. 
Then why the fuck do I smoke. 
Exactly. No reason 😪

I started at 15 I am 35 now. Just reading this makes me realize what I have done to my life. 
Nonetheless there is no point to beat yourself up for the past. 
All we can do as flawed Humans is to reflect and move on.  
Thank you leaves. I don’t want to pick it up again. 
I want to stay STRONG!!!! 


Gave away few grams to my friend. She can smoke it. She is a great friend. My neighbour  who doesn’t smoke will have a shit ton of pot since he thought he could give it to me. He knows of my decision. They all are supportive.",5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6793844103813171}"

Despite the color of my skin, the language I speak, and many other diferences I have with you guys, we all share the same problem and it is smoking pot. I want you all guys to know that finding this website and read a lot of the messages you've posted was my final motivation for quitting, Now I feel I'm not alone in this Journey, and I want you to know That I´ll be coming here every day.

I was working and in school full time, than started the first year of my diagnosis. (I don't want to go into detail for privacy reasons) it was horrific. I spent all my time in bed, in agony, 10/10 pain. I have diagnosed PTSD from this time period because of the high level of pain I was in. 

... But then I found marijuana and at first it seemed like the answer to everything, because I could at least cope enough to look after myself... And I dropped out of school and never went back to work. 

Now two years later my condition is still severe but not as bad, pain most days is 4/10 because I was able to make some lifestyle and diet changes, plus surgery. I have more pain on some days, but I still rely too much on my vape pen. I smoke all day every day. I miss out on family time to get high, for ""pain relief"" which is the perfect excuse because I do have pain. But I'm over that addict mentality. 

Also, since I'm improved somewhat, combined with  having to start working again because of Covid-19, I NEED to be 100% sober to work in my field.


Mostly though, I want this for myself. I guess I feel like instead of becoming addicted to opiods like other pain patients, I got addicted to weed. I want to be able to go back to school and work at least part time. I can't do that with this brain fog of addiction. 

On mobile, Hope this makes sense, I don't make posts on reddit very often. Xx

It has always been a suppressor for the long days of school and work. I should've moderated myself, but living from college apartment to college house, it was kind of a norm that I got looped into with the rest of my peers. I picked up every week, in fact, I wouldn't be able to sleep without having the peace of mind of knowing I had some to dispose of whenever. I wasn't high 24/7, but I was definitely high at least half the time usually. If I finished work or school, I immediately went straight to the bong or rolled a joint.

I got back from a trip last week from out of town. Notably, I was feeling under the weather the second I drank some coffee, and not long after that (an hour or two) a massive wave of fatigue hit me and I began to get warm. I smoked that night (after going 3 days cold turkey and only smoking one joint out of those three days) and had one of the worst panic attacks of my life, thinking that I was about to die and fall to the ground at any given moment.

That was when I drew the line and said that I was done with smoking marijuana. There's been many obvious reasons as to why I was leading up to that decision, but that was finally the nail in the coffin. So, I started to quit cold turkey completely, now I'm on day 8.

I have had a constant fever of 99.5-100 for eight days now. Being proactive, I went ahead and took a COVID test four days after the initial fever started and tested NEGATIVE. I have been eating a LOT, normally, in fact, I eat in the morning more than I did when I was smoking before. My hands and feet do not stop sweating, and I'm beginning to get a little worried mainly because of the fever. Every time I wake up I struggle to spend half my day just to feel normal (through eating more, taking vitamins, etc.). Now, my stool came out a very light color and I'm beginning to trip out.

This is my day 1 of being sober.  I noticed that I'm about to meet 10 years smoking weed, with pauses and attempts to quit from just a few days, to forever. Until yesterday, I've been smoking from morning to night,  I started to felt tremendously bored and without the energy to do the things I like or angered when I'm not smoking. I noticed how I kept telling myself that I'ts not a problem, convincing me that I only need one touch more and all will be good, but that ain't true.

I'm writing here because I understand the position of my friends towards this, and want to make a personal effort for myself as it solely my decision to quit weed. This year I attempted two or three times to temporarily quited but I was unable. Every time a friend offers me or when I see the possibility of buy, I fall for it, which makes me sad. I lived a lot of things related to weed these 10 years and when I look back I can recognize when smoking slowly affected my life, but i didn't care.

Male; age 25 muscle; decent shape.


TLDR: Every day I get more sickly; my sexuality gets worse; my cognitive ability is declining; and I feel like I committed  a crime with intense worry and a feeling as if I was smacked in the head and can’t think 

I’ve been smoking for the past ten years; marijuana became legal in my state a few years ago so now I only smoked premium concentrate dabs; friend has medical so no thc limit. 

I’d dab once per hour the biggest dab I could handle without wasting it; didn’t care about the huge cost. These concentrates were so strong and I think they contributed to my current situation of feeling terrible. There would be the odd day I ran out and couldn’t make it to the dispensary.

Anyways I’m quitting to enlist soon but now my health deteriorated after quitting. I don’t have underlying health problems and usually visit the doctor for any minor issue I have since I have great medical access but I don’t want this situation in my medical record if I’m gonna enlist soon.


-For the first two days I felt better honestly; even happier couldn’t feel hunger but that’s to be expected slept better too.

Day 3-7 

-dehydration and kidney pain, insomnia, anxiety 

my stomach felt oozy like I drank olive oil. It felt like I binge drank alcohol and had a severe hangover stomach wise. I could go 24 hours without eating because I just was not hungry and couldn’t make my body swallow the food. This progressively got worse until day 10.


Day 4: Erectile dysfunction starts around day 4

Day 10: 
unable to feel happiness, kidney pain went away stomach feels better but my hunger doesn’t appear until I’m legit starving and my muscles are wasting from the calories deficit.
Still feel really dry.... and dehydrated even when I drink water

My penis has been numb and I’ve basically lost sensation and it looks smaller and sad. 



I’m unable to stay erect unless I try really hard. It doesn’t feel pleasurable and there’s a loss of sensation; climax is dull and unsatisfying no pleasure.


I’m wondering if anyone else experienced the sexual problem and if it passed? I had my testosterone checked previously during a checkup unrelated to this situation, it was in the higher range

I’m wondering if weed damaged something inside me because I know if I relapsed I wouldn’t have this problem anymore.

I know I’m still withdrawing because I can still barely eat but now it’s gotten better and I can eat once a day.


I’m becoming sickly from the lack of hunger; the inability to feel happy; and the lack of sex drive.
I can’t hit the gym that often because my governor keeps changing COVID restrictions. 



Anyone know when my sexuality will come back? When I’ll be able to eat again?

I almost regret having the most premium concentrates you can get. 


For the first two days of quitting my sex drive was stronger before it ultimately died all at once.   It’s something to do with the marijuana. I refuse to accept that I have “Ed and the marijuana cured it” as a response; I feel as if the weed itself caused the impotence once I abstained.

I’m wondering if I damaged my body being a heavy smoker because my finachial circumstances I don’t have to work and would literally live a stoner lifestyle nonstop because I had no obligation to quit until now. I haven’t enlisted yet; and won’t be able to until these symptoms pass.


I feel like I’m going crazy and I regret smoking to begin with because I didn’t know this could happen; I feel like it’s the concentrates that really put me in this hole. My tolerance was so high bud would be like decaf coffee.


Anyone else relate? Did this happen to you? How long did it take to pass. I can ignore the temporary depression and anxiety; it’s not that bad. But I just feel sickly like I have a disease now, &amp;amp;lt;I don’t actually have one&amp;amp;gt; 

Need help. ;/

—-On day 14 today.

Headaches; my focus is actually getting worse as of today. And because I can’t focus I get moody when people have conversations with me because it’s legit exhausting I’m snapping at people to leave me alone.

Burning feel in stomach/ still hard to eat

Penis feels numb; hurts when I try to use it. Feels sore.

I think I’m developing a suicidal feeling as well. I genuinely feel like dying. I won’t act on it; I’m not at risk, I know I could literally go take a hit and reverse all these symptoms but I’m treating that as not an option. 

Can anyone relate to this at all? It’s miserable and if any of these problems are permanent I don’t see myself being able to live a normal sober life going forward.",7,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997536301612854}"

Long time lurker (3 plus years) first time poster, hope the specially created username for this gives someone a laugh at least as I can't get the song out my head now! I feel finally ready to accept that this is an addiction and that I have to treat it as such, and I cannot cheat it no matter how hard I've try.

For context: Day 6 sober this time, couldn't even tell you which number relapse this was, but it was shorter than usual (as I already knew it wasn't a good idea) and I immediately hammered it as soon as I picked up, and built what could have previously been months to years of tolerance into 2-3 weeks. But the positive to take is that it immediately showed me that despite 6 months sober (previously gotten over confident at this point before, have noted this as a potential trigger now) it still holds the power, not me, no matter how much negotiating I've done before starting, the little voice to continue past that day won. I've only finally just realised those little moments that start putting temptation there long before the actual caving. It's also shown me that every time I do relapse, it's significantly worse than the time before.

Triggers/reasons to stop: But this time I decided to take a step back, write out, and review the common themes. I was a daily user pretty much for 5 years, until 2.5 years ago after leaving a very unhealthy relationship and career. Since then it will be weeks/months at a time constantly without a break or complete abstinence. I was completely blown away to see a clear pattern in my use once I'd gotten all the potential triggers down on paper and the time line for the usage as well. I had always thought there were about half a dozen individual triggers that I've been working on coping mechanisms for which would mean I didn't need to lean on it (which has been helping greatly! I know now where in my local park my angry walk turns to relaxed peaceful walk) but I also realised that special events such as birthdays or Christmas will trigger the urge to use, mainly for the negative emotions that come up for me (I absolutely adore Birthdays and Christmas celebrations, so I'm still shocked it can also be a trigger), but turns out it also makes me feel kinda lonely. 

Festive thought: So, this means I'm already becoming slightly worried about New Years Eve (not my favourite day), the thought that I can't turn to weed to wrap up the year and escape the whole thing really left me feeling sad, but then I thought, if I was to do it just for that night, what could I plan around it so I pulled myself back out and stop before it runs away with me, dangerous thinking I know! but then I moved from that to, well if it is just that one night, why can't I just tough it out and then resume as normal the next day without the weed? I know deep down I can't be trusted to even have the one no matter how carefully crafted that plan would be because it would probably be April by the time I quit again following the pattern! Breaking it down NYE is about 6-8 hours that could potentially ruin the following 4 months, my health, my bank balance etc and that's me being optimistic! It's really spurred me on to try and make a plan now to avoid any of this, or even just learn to be ok with potentially staying in and watching tv for the night on my own, which is such a small sacrifice in the grand scheme of things now I'm being rational looking at the situation, rather than being sad I won't be high. 

The **TLDR** version would be, if you keep relapsing, it could be useful to look for any patterns to the timings and other events that are going on, and try and draw links between all the different events. I would have never imagined special occasions or certain months to be a trigger to me till I saw it today. I know I'm going to start putting into place a plan with myself to prevent the relapse now, rather than trying to ignore the situation and hope for the best when the time comes around.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9680859446525574}"

When I was 19 (22 now) I started smoking a half gram joint every night before bed. I always had a hard time getting to sleep and weed seemed to solve that. I didn’t get high during the day and never considered it a problem or an addiction. “Bro dont worry u cant get addicted to just weed”

A bit over a year ago my girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me. Completely destroyed my sense of life and identity as she was my whole world (in a codependent toxic way). I immediately started smoking upwards of 2 grams a day to numb the pain.

About three months ago I really started to realize that weed was now causing more damage to my mental health than the breakup was. I recognized it as an addiction but couldnt stop. 

A month ago I tried quitting. Lasted 5 days. The overwhelming anxiety, nausea, inability to eat or sleep, everything many others here report was strong in me too. I knew it was withdrawal but it was the first time experiencing it and I wasnt strong enough to endure it.

Im quitting again now. Its day 3 and I can barely think because the anxiety in my mind and chest is so strong. I have issues with anxiety outside of weed (even before I ever started) so this is the biggest withdrawal issue for me. I remember how it felt a month ago now though, and Im prepared for it. This time I know feeling the raw anxiety is what will heal me. 

This post is to certify my resolve and determination to quit. Thanks to this sub I know it will be worth it. Weed will NOT control my life. Love and peace to all",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9859153032302856}"

Today marks Day 16 for me, after 17 years of smoking flower daily and then 3 years of concentrates daily, with only a handful of short breaks along the way.  I'm finally feeling really good.  The first week was pretty rough with all the usual withdrawal symptoms - sleep issues, no appetite, no interest in doing anything and a fair amount of anxiety.  The second week was much better, with those same symptoms presenting but at maybe 30% of what they were the week before.  This week I'm finally sleeping well, the haze has lifted and my mind feels so wonderfully clear it's amazing.  

Strangely enough, I haven't had any cravings for weed; however, over the past couple of years I have also quit several other substances (alcohol, nicotine and various harder substances) and I've noticed that I've been thinking more about those substances the last few days.  It's as if I need *something*, anything to alter my day-to-day experience and help me relax.  I'm not going to cave though, I think I can do this.

Anyway, I wanted to share 4 quick key learnings that have come out of this:

1. The return of anticipation.  I hadn't realized it, but having weed as a crutch that I could indulge in whenever I wanted made the idea of genuine anticipation go out the window.  Being able to instantly ""fix"" how I was feeling with weed meant I never had a chance to look further out at something I could really look forward to.  That has changed now - I had totally forgotten how great the feeling of anticipation is. Looking forward to seeing someone on the weekend, or going for a relaxing bike ride later that evening, or even something as small as looking forward to my favourite meal.  These things have all come flooding back and I am FUCKING LOVING IT.
	

2. I control naps, naps don't control me.  I always knew that getting high to the point of passing out for a couple of hours on a regular basis was taking away time that I could be using for more productive things, but this has really opened my eyes to how much time I had been wasting.  Almost every day, at least once and often twice a day I would get high, and then higher, and then inevitably high enough to pass out.  And then of course waking up always felt terrible, both physically and mentally.  Now I can decide if and when I take a nap, I can decide how long it will be and when I wake up I can almost immediately go on about my day.  It's as if I've been given more life to live.
	
3. Welcome back, Boner!  For the last couple of years I've noticed that my erections are not as strong as they once were, and don't last very long unless I'm constantly aroused.  I assumed it was just because I'm getting older - I was wrong!  Wow. Boner City.
	
4. It's okay to be bored.  I know this one comes up often but I wanted to include it - weed makes it okay to be bored.  Anything can be made entertaining when there is a side of cannabis.  These last couple of weeks have been a reminder of what it feels like to be bored, and I'm re-learning how to fill my life with things I enjoy - both productive and unproductive - to fill my time.  Being bored sucks, but being forced to reckon with your boredom is SO worthwhile.

This is my first post here, but I've been following for a few weeks now. I've wanted to quit for a few weeks because I've noticed how toxic it has been for my mental health and how I've been in denial about having a dependency on it.

I was too weak to throw out the weed I had, so I decided to try and quit once I finished it off. Now I am 3 days in and the most noticable withdrawal symptoms have been insomnia, loss of apetite, occasional upset stomach, and difficulty concentrating and staying motivated. Taking melatonin has been helped me deal with the insomnia. Luckily, I have some great friends and I have spending A LOT of time with them recently, whcih keeps me in a good place mentally. I play piano and have been slacking with my practicing the last few days, but I am confident that when the fog in my head clears I will be practicing consistently again like I was before. As for right now it's a struggle with lazinness to sit down and focus.

Unfortunately, our university's gym is closed, so I haven't been able to lift for a few months, but I plan on starting that back up whenever school lets out for winter break in a few weeks.

Well since I started on this new journey there have been many ups and downs. Positives and negatives. The negatives being a almost constant state of depression a recent feeling of loss of my identity.  I don’t know who I am or what I am about, I don’t have many dreams and when I do my depression shuts them down. I am hoping this is only temporary and need to to activities to combat the negative effects that weed suppressed. 

I am productive with working out and my work but The euphoria weed gave me made things different then doing things when sober, there just isn’t as much gratification.

That being said I am way more productive and am taking on projects I never would have before my house is cleaner, my relationships have improved with others but my relationship to self feels very weak. 

I do not want to give in. I told myself I am giving myself at least 2 years before I ever decide to smoke again.

2020-11-10 13:45:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jrqsa9/145_months_doing_well_my_thoughts_on_paws/,14.5 Months. Doing well! My thoughts on PAWS :),"Hey everyone. I thought I'd write for my own therapy again, and because I think I'm making a breakthrough with this. And some people want me to write again.

As always my story first. I used recreationally for three months. I had a large dose on my birthday.  37 year old athletic male. No prior health issues. I quit cold turkey and had a horrendous 6-8 months of every horrible symptom you can think of followed by another 6 months of much milder managebale, yet still frustrating symptoms. At month 3 I thought I was dieing. And now by month 14.5 I'm almost a 9 out of 10.  Things have improved so so much.

So firstly you have to know that if you are experiencing this right now, that you will be fine in time. Time plus good healthy habits will lead you out of the darkness.

All of the below is my own thoughts for me, and not a recommendation for others. But it is the truth I've come to understand for myself.

What is PAWS anyways right? The acronym stands for ""Post Acute Withdrawl Syndrome"". A long cascade of symptoms that takes years to resolve for some.

Well I'm coming to terms with it being a mix of traumatic withdrawl from pot (the early months) followed by a resultant health anxiety disorder (this part is the long term rehabilitation from the early trauma).

I think the reason some of us get hit so hard with PAWS is because we have some inherent anxiety within us. I was in denial to a degree. As I look back on my life, I see how I've had anxiety bubbling below the surface for a long time. I used to pick hairs on my body long ago, I compulsively exercised, I have been nervous around others, etc,   I managed all of this over time, and grew into a very capable person. But the anxiety was within me, suppressed, it just kept shifting forms.

It finally manifested in the use of Cannabis. If I did not have anxiety, I never would have used it. 

So once I used and quit cannabis cold turkey, my anxiety went full tilt into fear, focusing on all my symptoms.

This in turn caused a secondary problem, an overwhelming release of stress hormones into my body which caused other complications. So one problem compounded another.

I've read so much on this over the months. From Shaun O Conners DP website, to science articles on Serotonin and the brain. But really, why do some of us get into this horrible mess of symptoms and not others?

It's the feedback loop we get stuck in. We obsess over our symptoms. Our brain's fear centre the Amygdala goes into full panic and releases everything you would need to survive an assault from a Tiger, and then this goes on for months. Your body can't handle the adrenaline and cortisol, and as a result, we get all the awful symptoms. Perhaps this syndrome should be called CAS (Cortisol Adrenaline Syndrome).

To me, PAWS is as follows. It's the time period past Acute withdrawl that you spend learning to trust and be confident in your brain and body again. It's like trying to drive a car after a car accident. The first time back in the car you drive it slower, and you look around cautiously at every turn. You may check the rear view mirror over and over again. You think every bump on the road is worse than it is. There's nothing wrong with the car, you simply don't trust the car, or the people around you, or the environment, or yourself.

PAWS is the time we spend learning to reconnect with our sense of trust in ourselves. Especially our mind, which is what weed acts upon.

I, like everyone else in this condition, is fully convinced that our symptoms are caused by weed and brain damage. Well early on yes for sure. But there comes a point when your physical self has healed, but your mind still lives in fear, preventing full healing. Thats why so many people who give themselves over to a higher power feel they are healed. They can offload their anxiety to someone else, and that gives them the time to calm down, and soon enough they are healed because they finally become relaxed.

No one with PAWS has ever died from any of the symptoms. Hence they are harmless. As long as we perceive them that way.

Here is what has helped me the most do far on the road to healing.

1. I went to my doctor for the symptoms in my body. I told him I thought I might have an anxiety disorder. Almost everyone with PAWS symptoms gets told that nothing is wrong. I chose to believe my Doctor when he told me he thought it was anxiety and that time would heal me. This helped to convince me it was anxiety.
2. I went to my optometrist to see if my eyes were ok (I had visual static, floaters). They told me I was fine. I chose to believe them. This helped to convince me it was anxiety.
3. I went to my dentist. They said I had bruxism and was grinding my teeth (Due to anxiety). I got a nightguard and it helped me. They also showed my Jaw cartilage which looks healthy. This helped to convince me it was anxiety.
4. I went to therapy for awhile. My therapist told me I had symptoms of anxiety. This helped to convince me it was anxiety.
5. I went to another therapist. Ditto. This helped to convince me it was anxiety.
6. I began googling my symptoms, but I also made sure to type the word ""Anxiety"" afterwards. Guess what? Every symptom I have is connected to anxiety. Even the scariest ones. Including depersonalization and disassociation. All anxiety.  Those two in particular simply happen because your brain is a bit overstressed, and it's running a bit slow. Kind of like having too many tabs open on your computer. Everything works, but just not as optimally as normal. Fewer stress tabs open, and the better it runs.
7. Maybe the biggest help for me has been the following two resources. Shaun O Connor's DP website. And the book DARE on amazon. I cannot stress the DARE response enough. It finally sealed the deal for me on how I think about PAWS and how to respond to anxiety. I'll explain below.
8. Sitting with my anxiety and not fighting it. This is the DARE response. The more I fight my own symptoms, the more I will simply create more anxiety. Instead I have to learn to sit with them. Ask for more. Embrace them, until I get bored with them and move on. This defuses them, and I do believe in time it will eliminate them. Since I've started, I've seen some more improvement. Read the book if you want to know more.
9. Maybe this is the most important. I have had to truly 100% fully believe that this problem is anxiety and nothing else. The journey to 100% belief in that has taken some time, and undoubtedly it's the same for everyone. But I do believe it now. Weed has long left me. It's now retraining my brain to be comfortable with myself again.
10. Other healthy habits (Sleep, clean eating, sobriety, moderate exercise, drinking water, socializing, etc) are all a part of the process. So are anxiety management techniques (Deep breathing, grounding techniques, etc). But these techniques are ""managing"" only. Temporary relief. True elimination will come from changing my thought patterns. Which is what the DARE response is.
11. And TIME. This all takes work and time. There is no rush or hurry. Keeping track of the progress is critical to keeping moving forward.
12. Again, truly 100% believing this is all just anxiety and its manifesting symptoms.
13. Have friends who will listen. Expressing your frustrations is all a part of walking the road to the narrative that heals you.

I've learned so much from PAWS. I do truly see it now as something that I was meant to have. I realize the anxiety monster has danced around me my whole life. It has influenced me in ways I did not fully understand until now. I can even connect it now to events from my childhood and young adult life.   I heard someone once say weed is an amplifier. It can amplify food, sensations, etc, but it can also amplify our inner selves. I unleashed the tiger that I had caged. But in a way thats something of a gift. I'm learning something deeply important about myself: My relationship to my own thoughts. I know in a year or two, I'll really have come a long way to learning the deep truth about myself. For that I'm truly grateful for this experience. One day instead of caging that tiger, he will become domesticated and at times even be my friend.  I'm getting there.

Remember, I was once a 2 out of 10 with suicidal thoughts. Now I'm almost a 9 out of 10 eager to finish my walk through the valley.  Even my head feels cooler and less tight than before. I still have my ups and downs. I'm working really hard on following the DARE protocol, and living with good healthy life habits for my body and mind. I have ups and downs still, but what I really notice lately, is a sense of control again. Like I can tell my brain to calm down, and it actually starts to listen a bit, and then I move along to more important things. It's coming along.

Once again, everyone with PAWS, you will get better. You will walk the path and see the light of healing. And you will become more than you ever thought you could be. Give it time, be healthy, and you will find your way to the light and the truth.

Loving kindness to you all

2020-11-10 13:04:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jrpyg4/550_days_thc_free/,550 days THC free.,"Hello fellow leavers.

Today marks the day of 550 days THC free after smoking daily for 17 years.


Backstory I started smoking hash when I was 11 years old. I come from a very small village in the UK and all the kids from ages 9-17 used to hang about together. My first foray into smoking cannabis was having a ""blowback"" when I was 11 years old. This became a weekly thing at the youth club untill it was cancelled.


Fast forward to when I was 13 and being a house party of a friend's. The older siblings were throwing the party and were 17 and 20 respectively. It was here when I actually got given my first bit of hash to myself. I would make pipes out of apples in the orchards by my house and smoke it through them, lighters being easy to get hold of since both my parents were tobacco smokers.


I would save pocket money and buy from the local dealer and then at break times at school would always have a couple of toots/shotty with my mates in the smoking area on the corner of the playground.


Never thought it was much of a big thing. We always had the chats that it led to harder stuff (which it did) and also the ""reefer madness"" was always looming which I just took for adults who know nothing and myself being a teenager who knew better than them.


Then weed/skunk became the next thing and wow what a thing.  When I was 16 I was daily smoking herbal cannabis and discovered it's a lot stronger than the soapbar/puff/hash we had been smoking but more expensive. It was around this time a couple of my mates started to have an adverse reaction to it becoming overly paranoid/anxious about life and things in general, but just put it down to them being lightweights. Have to say I regret that sort of thinking to fuck now I'll divulge later. Around this time also I realised it's a lot cheaper to just buy/tick a shit load and sell it off and smoke the profits. Which is how I became the dealer of my secondary school.


Around this time one of my friends had a very severe panic attack while high and another also become increasingly paranoid about leaving the house.


Anyway the dealer I used to get my skunk off also decided to start giving me freebies of pills and sniff... How to form a habit in 3 easy steps commenced.


I carried on dealing smoking toots/shottys necking pills, speed, mushrooms, lsd and sniff. When I was about 23 I finally decided that toots was trampy as fuck but carried on with the harder stuff since it was fun. Moved onto joints around that time after this time.


Fast forward through years of blazing constantly. I now have 2 dead friends from overdoses. I have 2 in permanent care in mental health residences. Another 1 will not leave his house unless it to get food or weed. And one more who is a complete shut who thinks he is going to be mugged as soon as he steps outside. People who say it can't and won't fuck you up don't have a clue what they are going on about mate.


Around 29 I started getting some really dark thoughts whenever I was stoned. I could t stop thinking about death and everyone dying around me. I would go to work and just be craving a smoke all day then get home and light up a solid chuck on a video game and before I knew it, it was cold sweats and having a panic attack over death or something completely bonkers.


I kept this up for a couple years as i was convinced I was worse if I didn't have any smoke. I would screw my nut off if I couldn't get any, would have temper tantrums. Smash up telly's, games consoles, pcs, whatever, even my car I snagged to bits in a rage of not being able to get any smoke. Things were not good at all when I had no smoke but as soon as I lit up a joint I would feel fine for 10 mins then in creeps that paranoia again. I have to add at this time I had made two attempts on my life because of this and was put of a prescription of mitazipines which became my friends for the next few years  


I then was out with my friend and his to be wife who gave up the grass a couple years before me. I was in a well known park and was dropping some mdma and some pics I scored off a mate and rolled up a fat one around all these woman and kids. I just come out of another bad relationship at the time, she turned to me mortified at what I was doing and said something along the lines of ""how do you expect to get a nice girls if your in a park doing that sort of shit"" BOOM reality hit me like a freight train and decided from then all the drugs were OFF (I had a very expensive coke habit fully developed at this time as well)


The first 3 weeks of no smoke. Holy. Shit. Hard wasn't the word being used to feeling that way for so long. Probably didn't help I was coming off the gear as well..


Then I started to dream again.
I hadn't had a dream in 16, 17, 18 years??
Then I started getting up in the morning.
Then I started getting back into old hobbies I lost along the way like painting, music, outdoorsy shit.


I'd still wake up everyday craving a smoke, I then decided to quit the fags as rolling my own just wasn't helping at all so I got into vaping.


Then I found Buddhism and meditation.
I cannot recommend mediation enough.
First time I went I was like ""this is all bollocks and what a load of kum-by-yah my lord type of shit"" after the initial immature sniggles and shit I had my first guided group meditation and fuck me didn't I feel kind of better.. 
I stuck about afterwards for green tea and biscuits and had a chat about Buddhist philosophy and that.
Then next week I went again. And the week after that and the week after that. Started going to the other nightly meey up as well so twice a week.


After about a month I woke up went about my day and after work I realised it was the first day I had woken up not having a smoke.


I went back to my classes twice a week and decided to stop taking my medication as the feelings of dread had also lifted.


Fast forward to today I don't go to classes anymore and I don't meditate but fucking hell I'm a completely different person, I've got a career, wife, kids all them things I used to get all paranoid about not ever having.


All my mates are also leavers now, the last one is currently struggling but we are getting him through it.


I can't recommend the positives enough. I'm not anti weed like some people are but if you are smoking it everyday you have got a problem. If someone gets shitfaced on booze everyday you say they are a pisshead what's the difference eh?


Anyway that's my ramble. I just found this sub and wanted to share my story. It's so doable all my dudes and dudettes. Them cunts who say it is not bad for you or you can't get addicted etc.. funny how none of them can stop it. They don't know shit.


Maybe one day when I'm out of my job I might partake in the devil's lettuce again who knows. But I do know now that my life is so better off without it.


Life is really beautiful.

Working shitty jobs and living at home. Had ton of girlfriends most smoked. I ended up meeting my wife who is American I am Canadian. We met playing Online. She knew I smoked and I would go on long breaks when I would visit for months. I’d go Home and just use heavy again. Fast forward 10 years later I am now living in the US legal with our two kids and her two step kids (we don’t get along which is a common stress which makes me wanna smoke ) I have been here legal for a few years it took me about 6 months to find a contact. I now am back into the routine of smoking heavy. I am sick of it. My high is worthless so why am I even doing this. I get maybe a bit of a head buzz the. Just tired and cotton mouth. But it’s going to be so hard. It’s something I just do for so many years.

Weed is still fun for me, I can smoke up to 5-6 times a day and still feel much better.  It helps me sleep, it helps me eat, it makes my empty life seem less empty.  It gives me something to look forward to, it gives me a major sense of relief, it puts a pause on my depression for a couple hours.  So why am I trying to quit?  Mainly one symptom: Lack of motivation.  My life lacks structure, and without self-motivation, I get nowhere on anything.  The thing is, I've always had issues with motivation, long before I started smoking.  So I'm skeptical that quitting will help all that much, even though that's a common downside to smoking.  However, it was suggested that any improvements from med changes might be masked by marijuana, and so I need to take some time off to give other meds a chance to work.

I'm on Day 2, and Day 1 was pretty bad.  Filling up my time is hard, because I still have no motivation to do anything.  I basically spent yesterday napping (which was harder than usual) and binging TV (which was way less fun than usual).  Probably the same today?  I know I'm supposed to exercise and work and clean and pick up hobbies, but motivation to do so is even worse than usual because of the whole nothing to look forward to aspect.

Found out I had a rare type of epilepsy 4 years ago and the doctor told me I'd likely been treating the symptoms with the daily cannabis use so I never realized there was a problem. I mean, obviously I realized there was a problem. I was numbing the pain with weed everyday. It was an emotional crutch before it became a physical one. I don't want to make my weed usage out to be a medical treatment plan because that's just not how it started. 

I live in the US and work for a company where you could possibly get drug tested at any time. Medical marijuana cards don't constitute as acceptable reasons for failing so if I piss hot, my life is over. Period.

I've been flying under the radar so far but I had a night terror so bad a few weeks ago that has truly scared me straight. I cannot lose my job. If I lose my job, I lose my health insurance and if I lose my job because of a failed drug test, I'll never get another job again.

I'm mourning here because it doesn't feel ""fair"" to lose my job for being a medical marijuana user. But life isn't fair and the high shouldn't be worth losing my career over. 

Since the weed genuinely does help stave off my focal seizures, I'm trying to ween myself off of the thc. I quit cold turkey once in 2018 and it was a shock to the system. Outside of the withdrawals, the seizures were a LOT. They're not the ""pass out and shake"" kind of seizures like you see on TV. They're like being trapped inside your mind while your body stays frozen in place. Like sleep paralysis but you're completely awake. 

It's a  nightmare and the reason why I've justified my daily consumption for the last 4 of 12 years.

I have true pharmaceuticals that help though. Legal medications that prevent seizures just as well as the weed. But they don't make me feel good.. Some make me grumpy. Some make me feel a little sick to my stomach. And none make me high. That's the real issue. 

I'm prepped and ready to handle the physical symptoms of getting off weed. It's the mental impact that I'm most afraid of.

How do you motivate yourself to quit when you have to but REALLY don't want to?

I was never aiming for this day, but seeing those triple digits, fuck, man, they really put some stuff into perspective. I've come really far and no one can take that away. I'm so proud of who I've become, how much more I feel like myself, and even though there are still so, so many bad days, I know that there will always be bad times as much as there will be good. So here are some things that I can reflect on. 

\- I don't ever wanna smoke again, not one puff, not ""one more time"", nothing, because I know what it's like to have everything stripped away from me because of it. Shortly after I quit I got surprised tested and I felt like I was in the worst position of my life, and by some miracle of God I came out on the other side fine. 

\- You are your own. You are your own person, you are your own interests, you are your own hopes, your own dreams and achievements, and especially, especially, especially your own creativity. The drug doesn't dictate how you got here today to become who you are, you do. It's so scary to think that you lose interest in so many things. I couldn't listen to music as long or watch youtube videos with the same enjoyment because it felt... so different. I remember I didn't wanna eat until I had a hit, I couldn't watch a single youtube video without it. It's mentally addicting and does not let anyone tell you it's not :/

\- I go on walks every day or every other day and my goodness they have helped:,) I just throw on some music or some great podcasts and they have helped me break the time so, so much more than I would've thought. Here's some that get me through it every day: 

Dissect: if you're into music please give this one a try. The first season is on To Pimp a Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar and it taught me my love for music again. Legit cried at the end when I heard all of the listeners give their own personal stories with the album and I felt whole again. 

Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend: makes me laugh every day:) I recommend the Adam Sandler episode first. 

The Truth: absolutely fantastic short audio stories. Listen to The Dark End of the Mall first. The Body Genius is also hilarious.

\- Ok back on topic. I put on 7 pounds since I quit. I am pretty skinny and tbh, I smoked to make myself feel better and not think about fixing it. It was a really sad feeling, but now I'm exercising more and walking helps a lot too. I'm happy with my progress. To anyone needing motivation, just do 10 pushups and 15 situps in the morning before you wake up and then go to bed. That pushed me more than you could imagine, and I could share my personal at-home routine too if you'd like!

\- Most importantly, I learned that to trust my own instincts. I don't have to be high to make decisions based on sensory feeling anymore, my mind is a lot stronger than it was before. It's completely true that your memory starts to kick back into gear too. 

That's my spiel for now. This community showed me that I'm not alone like I know that my friends will always be there for me but it helps to feel a little anonymous and I'm grateful for all of the subreddit. Just remember to keep what's important to you now that you're off of it. If anyone wants to shoot me a dm I would be happy to go more into specifics about anything I said.

There is no doubt that it has hindered my development and worsened my memory and communication skills. I will not deny that, and I know that it is not good for me. Simultaneously, I’ve been suspecting that I’ve been living with undiagnosed ADHD. Once I began deeply researching it I connected the dots throughout my life—or what little I can remember of it—and it’s almost undeniable to me that I have it. It all makes sense—the tics, chronic nail biting, racing thoughts, inability to focus or sit still...However, I’m also seriously questioning and doubting myself. Have I been wrong this whole time, about it being ADHD? Was it just smoking weed all along that made me like this? Am I just remembering my childhood wrong? And if that’s true, I don’t think that I could deal with the guilt and shame about not only my damaged frontal lobe but also using a mental illness as an excuse. (I think that my therapist/psychiatrist suspects that of me. When I bring up ADHD, the first thing they always say to me is how those symptoms also arise from chronic smoking. I feel invalidated and alone to say the least.)
I don’t want to be that person. I REALLY don’t. But at the same time, I’m fairly convinced that I’m correct about my ADHD. It would clearly and neatly explain nearly all of the issues in my life. 
You might be thinking “why don’t you just quit and find out?” which is where my dread stems from. I’m a complete burnout. I can’t go to school, hold a job, or be productive in any way, really. I’m borderline disabled whether I smoke or not, and I’m afraid that quitting will only make me feel worse. I find this sub somewhat hypocritical...half of y’all are preaching about the light at the end of the tunnel and saying “Oh after the 3 days it’s fine!” or “after the first 2 weeks it’s fine!” Yet all I see is posts from people who’ve been in the hole for months or years, asking how long the torture of withdrawal and depression is going to last. And the problem with my situation is that I simply DO NOT have the strength to go through that. Like I said, I’m completely burnt out. I’m traumatized, chronically depressed, fatigued, zero motivation as usual, I have no interest in anything whatsoever (that isn’t even an exaggeration anymore), existentially and spiritually sick, no desire to participate in this world or this life. And because of all of this, I do not have any kind of social life, school, work, long or short term goals, and I am and always have been chronically bored.

I had always weighed the costs of getting high but my first two years of college were basically surrounded by friends who smoked and I couldn’t find it in myself to quit cold turkey. It was a social activity for me and my friends and I saw little incentive to set myself apart from said circle of friends. The first months of quarantine saw me smoking every day as an escape from boredom, eventually invoking feelings of guilt and anger. Before a week ago it became a financial liability and I realized, at my ripe age of 20, that nothing good could come from a continued habit while my brain develops. While fun during the pinnacle of my highs, coming down started to turn into headaches and slight nausea. Would love some feedback on others experiences and speed bumps encountered on the path to sobriety.

I knew I didn't have anything in there his search turned up nothing and he looked very disappointed and sighed when he let me out of handcuffs.

That was not only very upsetting being a man of color but to sigh and look upset you have nothing to arrest me over is a little alarming. However I took my ticket informed then there's bigger things they should concern themselves with besides the smell of marijuana. Even though I felt it was harassment I felt more embarrassed of myself for allowing myself to be in that place and time.

It'll never happen again it was a real eye opener not only because it was the first and last time I'd ever been in handcuffs but the fact he was getting ready to take me to jail for anything he found.

Last weekend I had the opportunity to buy weed and smoke for the first time in months. I was excited to be lazy and chill out over the weekend, which I definitely did. During my high, I was thinking a lot and realized that while weed is fun, it just feels like something that holds me back now. I'm currently on a weight loss journey and I've lost 25+ lbs since January. However after smoking, I got massive cravings and ate way more than I should have, resulting in me putting on 2 lbs this morning due to water weight and feeling bloated. I also had plans to study UI/UX for a block of time but was too high to focus. 

When I was high I realized that weed is honestly just holding me back from my personal goals at this point. It was nice to smoke when I was younger and didn't have any defined goals/responsibilities, but as of now it's just a hindrance. I spent $60 that weekend on the weed, glass piece, and grinder. Threw that all out after this weekend's smoke session. It was a scary thought to realize how easy of a habit this could become and how stagnant my life could get.

I’m re-joining this group after a six month relapse. I quit in January for almost four months so I could participate in an intensive mental health outpatient program. I was able to keep up the sobriety for a couple of months after leaving the program but relapsed once the boredom of covid took over in late May.

I have made tremendous strides in treating my mental health issues over the last 11 months, and I’m really proud of myself! But I know that I’m holding myself back and risking a relapse with my mental illness if I keep this up.

Of course, at the beginning I convinced myself that since I was able to abstain for four months, SURELY I would have the willpower to use it only occasionally. It literally took me two days before I was using daily again, and I have been for the most part since June. I’ve gained a ton of weight, have started slacking at work and letting responsibilities at home fall by the wayside.

EDIT:

Someone asked me how long it took for me to start feeling a difference within myself. Some people seemed to find my answer helpful, so I thought I'd include it here -

There's no real easy or simple answer to that question. I guess, when I started consistently replacing weed with other activities that were better for me, and formed new habits based around those activities? When I actively sought and found joy in other aspects of my life, basically. But even that's just a tiny part of it.

One big misconception I often encounter on this sub is the idea that, by simply removing the weed from your life, your problems will vanish on their own. In my personal experience, that has simply not been the case. What I will say, however, is that quitting weed gave me the tools to tackle those problems, whereas daily weed use just masked them, and ultimately kept me mired in the same place.

I won't lie, it has been a long, and slow journey towards self-improvement, and it is one that continues to this day. But one thing I do know for sure is that I am in a much better place now than I ever have been before.

I can only speak for myself, but I smoked basically every day from the age of 14 to 25. I had absolutely zero sense of who I was supposed to be as an adult, as my entire development had been framed through the haze of smoking weed. In other words, it touched every experience that I had, which meant I didn't have a genuine sense of what those experiences actually meant to me, or how they should have informed my sense of self. Removing weed from my life was merely the first step in figuring out who I really was, but this is not something that happens passively - it is a process that has to be engaged with on an active level.

To put it simply, I had to completely rebuild myself from the ground up, and that process took a lot longer than a month, or 6 months, or even a year to start having any real effect. When you are quitting any drug, you are effectively replacing instant gratification with a more slow-release reward system, which is why it can be so hard to quit (and so hard to readjust once you have quit). Drugs are instantly satisfying in the moment - life is not. But I had to trust that I was making the right decision by quitting, and if I still wasn't happy, I had to look at what other aspects of my life needed changing, and find the motivation to do something about it (which, again - is a lot easier without weed). Like I said - the rewards weren't instant, but they were there, and they are absolutely worth seeking out.",284,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9936677813529968}"

I feel so done. I feel like I’ve done my experimenting, I’ve tried to moderate, it doesn’t work. So I’m employing a new strategy with my therapist.

I had good smoking/edibles sessions this weekend, with the specific mindset that I was saying goodbye. And I took note of how I actually felt being high (anxious, annoyed, bored, incapable, forgetful...) to combat the romantic visual when my brain is trying to justify smoking.

I had a meditation and journaling session with a friend last night where I said goodbye. I wrote weed a letter, I thanked it for the purpose it used to serve. I started smoking when I was 16 and going through the worst of my moms alcoholism. It served its purpose during that time. Then it served it’s purpose helping me focus when I felt scattered or anxious, helped me get up and do healthy things when was depressed. But now...I have healthier, established tools to deal with all of those things. I don’t need weed anymore. It no longer serves that purpose. I feel like I’m accepting that. 

I pulled tarot cards to show me the gifts that sobriety are going to bring me and the results were intense and beautiful.

My mindset has also shifted in that I am mindful about what I put in my body. I quit drinking for this reason and I think it’ll help on the journey to quit smoking for good too. Weed is poison to my body (lungs for instance), mind, and spirit. I am feeling excited to be present.

This week might be difficult, I’m already having a hard time focusing, which is why I’m here right now, posting...just for something to focus on for a minute. I have 5 days off from work after tomorrow and I’m worried about the potential for boredom (biggest trigger) so you might see a lot more of me soon here. My therapist and I came up with strategies to hopefully help me get through those cravings...

Keeping my journal with me and writing for a bit to distract myself and also write feelings I can discuss with my therapist next week. I am also just carrying around my tarot cards with the journal so I can pull one and journal about it for a distraction.

I put the intention on one of my flat, polished crystals that I can carry with me and fidget with like a worry stone. I’ve had this stone forever and never felt like I had an intention for it yet, it’s just kind of been there doing nothing and now it feels like it’s been waiting to serve this exact purpose. It’s fitting that it’s rose quartz which is all about love and this journey is about self love.

If I’m craving, I can make myself a cup of tea to have a little ritual to do that looks a lot like the ritual of weed smoking. Putting herbs into a container, waiting for the water to heat up (I mostly used a dry herb vaporizer, so it’s kinda similar) and enjoying it.

I’m expecting to sleep it off a bit. Ready for naps. I’m expecting to have some sleeplessness and vivid dreams...though since I’ve only been back to smoking for 4 weeks, I’m hoping that withdrawal symptoms subside quickly.

I’m taking myself clothing shopping this week because it’s my birthday week and I never really get new (used 😊) clothes. So, I think that will feel like a nice treat and representative of wanting to take better care of myself, care more about my appearance, etc.

The other difference is I really feel like taking this one day at a time, which I know is necessary but of course my brain has fought that for so long. I have a current goal of 365 days but that’s just so I have this concrete thing in my head that we’re not even reevaluating this decision for a year. I think it also helps take it one day at a time when I’m giving myself the freedom to reevaluate later, but it’s so far away that I’ll have built up to many good tools by then I won’t want to look back.

All my friends continued smoking and I joined them back here and there after I was done with the service, after which a breakup pushed me to return to my stoner self pretty quickly.

I have since smoked almost daily mostly at the evenings, managed to get a good job and now studying a very demanding degree at university, what is sometimes called a functioning stoner (btw I am currently approaching 26).

Had a few breaks here and there, the longest of them lasting about a month.

Because of the recent lockdowns I started smoking a lot more, finishing more than 5g's a week.

Decided to quit a month ago and still holding on, and my friends are still smoking but it's not so bad (I started smoking cigarettes instead).

I have a lot of insights on weed and quitting, but that's not why I'm writing here.

I'm writing here because I feel bad for smoking all this time. For a long long time I was smoking while knowing how bad it is in the long run and having experienced a few breaks, I knew how hard it is gonna be.

This time I finally realize that despite my impulses and my ultra crafty brain trying to convince itself it's okay to take a puff here and there, I just tell myself it's not good for me anymore and that I shouldn't, and that seems to work.

But, and that's a big one, I'm so freaking ashamed. Ashamed of smoking even while knowing everything I know now that I am a little sober (a month isn't that long relatively speaking), ashamed of this big weakness I suddenly feel towards a specific smell, ashamed of admitting I'm an addict and that's probably never going to go away.
Ashamed of how hard some days are, how hard is it to fall asleep sometimes and how hard all these emotions are, because I knew better but didn't act on it and now am paying the price.

Long time lurker and hoverer and I believe now is the time to share my story and experiences.

Smoked for literally half my life, 28 years old now and started when I was 14. It's crazy to think I spent half my life with the Green Goddess. I'm writing this to express the darkness and the depth of the hole we all can experience when smoking weed.

Unlike most people on here that have anxiety, social issues and depression.. I believe I was a healthy 14 y.o with minimal physical and mental issues. This is why it's so scary.. I lied to myself and hid behind weed and was a closet smoker and pretty much no one outside my friend group really knew. I believe I cherished that aspect, the fact that I was high all the time and was able to go to social settings or a public place and act like I'm not high. I believe this is where my denial of addiction began.. fast forward to a couple weeks ago.. the love of my life broke up with me because I consistently and constantly hid and lied about smoking weed. The funny part is, she had nothing against me smoking, but for some reason I just failed to have the nerve to be upfront and tell her. This is when I came to the realization that I was in denial and I did in fact have an addiction and dependency.

Now, two weeks clean I realize how much weed has affected my mental state and acted as a crutch for pretty much anything that I did.. whether it was to calm down after a fight, smoke before an event.. after an event, before I slept.. and if I couldn't sleep after a joint I would literally roll another joint up to fall asleep at 5am. That's disgusting.. I'm disgusting.. but you know what I'm learning to love myself and to really understand what my goal in life is. Sure I can smoke and maintain a somewhat healthy lifestyle.. but that is the weed in my brain triggering the same patterns when I quit before. Everytime I took a break from it, in my head it was easy because I knew I would eventually be able to smoke again. Now, its completely different, I lost the love of my life because of my love for weed, and I will never forgive myself for that. I understand now I can't be a weekend smoker, I can't even have one dose of it even if I were to be clean for the next 5 years.. because I know the cyclical pattern that weed has on myself. I apologize for the long rant.. but I want to thank the whole community for being a part of my inspiration to quit for life. You guys have been the primary reason why I've looked deeply into myself and knowing that there are so many people that are going through the same thing.. it just makes my battle with addiction a little bit better. Love you all and hope everyone stays strong during these tough times.

2020-11-09 05:26:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jqv8lb/to_peace_true_to_my_word/,To: Peace. True to my word.,"Hey everyone, my name is David and I am 20 years old.

I started consecutively smoking the summer after graduating high school. Walking through those large red doors to the cafeteria for the last time with my whole life ahead of me, I was confident with my English exam mark regardless of the low effort at studying prior too. I smoked basically every day that summer. Joints, chops, and edibles whatever I could get my hands on really. Blasting my brain with THC and euphoria. It was harmless fun and a good time, always. So many of those crazy memories were made. With all the stories to tell it's really only a quarter of that timeline. This leaves the rest of that equation and where did they go? Far off memories...all accumulated over the past two years of on and off consumption of what some call medication.

Medication? 

This term is to be used for a substance or act that serves a benefitting purpose to your body, soul, and mind. I thought that's what weed was for me for a long time and now know that this is just not the case anymore when I use it. It's this illusion that my life is better with marijuana, that my life is more eventful and thrilling living day to day in a higher state of mind. 

I have experienced a good amount of drugs and hallucinogens at my age to be honest. I have had a fascination with experiencing the world around me in ways nobody could imagine sober. I won't deny that I've used drugs as an escape from my mind. Not having done any of those for over a year now I've only just been smoking my weed. It's not anywhere near as extreme but the emotional toll weed can take on life really does creep up on you. There is a common pattern between me and the substance:

I'll smoke occasionally and then sometimes decide to only with friends. However the next month I'll start smoking almost every day by myself to the point of disgust and then choose to take another few months break from weed. Next thing I know I'm back smoking again by myself. It's not pleasurable anymore. I thought that one time wouldn't hurt because it's okay my mind is clear now and I deserve to treat myself. Oh, how I will be deceived. It's like running laps through my head because I know we've been here before you and me. The day after I felt this very uneasy clouded feeling going through my day being spaced out and not really there. Days progress and I smoke again or maybe I'll take a break one day but fall back again to smoking almost every day for weeks. By this time life gets dull and every day of the week is a battle in my mind as I attempt to manage my emotions while trying to stay level-headed and not let it get the best of me.

When I smoked out of an apple earlier today that wave of utmost disgust came over me again. Out of desperation to get high and pure laziness not wanting to roll a joint I wasted a beautiful piece of fruit so I could reach a high to escape my mind once again. I don't feel myself when I smoke weed anymore. It makes me feel weak as I'm never able to put my full focus into what I'm working on or who I'm with because my mind is running too fast for me to keep up. When I did take that 2.5 months break off weed it sure as hell was full of up and downs as the irritability and cravings kicked in. I did make it that far. I really did start to feel high on life again. I was finally being creative and putting focus on completing my goals.

What's the point of living in an alternate state of mind when it takes you away from the beauty that comes from living life and the endless possibilities of what we can achieve here on earth?

How could I possibly continue to allow myself to be deceived, knowing the harm brought to me?

Giving someone your word is a bond built between two people. A trust that there will be follow-through along what was stated. Keeping true to my word is something that I have struggled with for a very long time. I haven't been the best at being on time for anything. This is NOT who I wish to be known for any longer. I've started to misplace my belongings a lot lately, all while retracing steps and forgetting information. It's very frustrating as I'm farthest away from reaching any level of peace knowing I lost something of mine. It feels like it's every week I'm doing laps around work looking for my damn water bottle. Pathetic really. I've hovered over this subreddit for some time now and read all of your stories when I'm feeling lost. While my mind has been high in this continuous dull state of melancholy matched with a whirlpool of emotions, I find myself right back at square one. I've had this talk with myself before...weed is just a forbidden fruit to me right now in my life. 

This past year has really flown by as I've experienced most of it up in the clouds. I don't want to look back six months from now and be right where I started again. There is too much LIFE for me to live. I have learned so much about myself as I remember to appreciate trials and tribulations for the lessons they teach. It's well past due time to plant my feet in sober soil and blossom into who I am truly meant to be. I choose to be a man of my word. 

**The greatest high is that of loving life for what it is.** 

**Enough is enough. No longer will I be burdened by the chains.**

**It starts from within.** 

**How will my word ever be respected if I don't do so myself?**

**This is where it all begins.**

**A crutch on my mind is presented as a gift from the top shelf.**

**I choose to dream again.** 

Thank you for reading my post. I wish of peace and prosperity for you all, upon a shooting star.

I ended up making some extra money during lockdown though, and started vaping heavily during quarantine to deal with a difficult living situation. I've been using carts daily for the past seven months or so, mostly 85%+ THC and live resin. The first few months I was high 24/7, but the last few have mostly involved vaping at night to sleep.

I've struggled with severe, untreatable depression and anxiety for the past several years (spent sober), and noticed that I was a lot more functional after a few months of vaping. It seemed to be helping with mood, anxiety and ADHD symptoms, until it...wasn't. I think it was related to a separate depression med I started a few weeks ago - normally my carts just even out my mood and don't get me that high, but the carts + meds were a bad combo because I'd get extremely, uncomfortably high. Lots of anxiety and paranoia to the point where I thought I was losing my mind a little, when usually all they do is lift my mood or make me contemplative then sleepy.

I tapered for about a week starting in late October, then quit cold turkey about a week ago (with one small relapse, a couple hits off a cart - it just made my anxiety worse so I stopped). I've been having a weird, difficult time so far. I'm not experiencing much insomnia yet (normally it's brutal when quitting carts), but that could be the THC still in my system. When I close my eyes I still feel a little high. My anxiety has gone down a bit, but my depression is back and it feels like a black hole. I'm a lot older now than when I first started smoking, with many more failures and regrets under my belt.

My abusive, shitty living situation is now being experienced in all its full glory, along with all my past baggage and things I wasn't able to do (not due to lack of desire, but chronic mental illness). Weed made all that tolerable during 2020, and without it I don't know how to cope. I'm currently in therapy, already exercising daily and meditating, but I just feel so empty.

I had made some really positive changes in my life this year but there are still some major issues plaguing me that weed has played a huge part in. 

The first 3 days were honestly fine. No weird moods, slept fine, cravings were manageable. But today and yesterday? Lord have mercy. At one point last night at around midnight (I try to be asleep at 10 to be up at 6) I was sitting up, crosslegged on my bed in the pitch darkness with my head in my hands, not crying, but I was in absolute emotional anguish. The loneliness, the emptiness and the dread of having to face the week was really intense. My heart really goes out to those with a much heavier habit than mine. Thank God I have recently established a solid meditation practice where I am learning to simply observe and not identify with my thoughts and emotions. I cannot recommend meditating enough (I use the Waking Up app and it has been an absolute blessing in my life). It can really make profoundly positive changes in your experience of life if you learn and practice properly. But I digress.

I must keep reminding myself that:
-I deserve to live up to my potential
-I deserve to be connected to my higher self

On the morning of October15th I woke up and fired up the dab rig like every other day before it \[quartz banger and e-nail\] and took the usual rip. Something hit me and I can't fully explain it mostly because I was baked daily for a year straight with zero breaks in between. I just told my self to cut back for the day and did it a total of three times. October, 16th rolls around, same routine and same results. On October, 17th little did I know I was going to be taking my final dab and I remember it down to the minute.

At 11:45AM that morning with some hesitance because of the prior two days I let her rip and the same sickness washed over me again. Something inside of me broke and I realized every time I touched that rig it was scaring the hell out of me and making me feel ill. That day was the final day I ever dabbed. On the morning of October 18th I woke to severe anxiety and my heart was pounding and a impending sense of doom just took full control of my body and mind. I remember that day so vividly unlike most of the year before it. I shot straight up out of bed and raced to the bathroom and had really bad diarrhea and after it was over I raced to my closet to get my clothes. I just remember thinking to myself oh my God I am having a heart attack and I'm going to die, you have to get dressed and go to the hospital now and that is exactly what I did. I walked into that hospital ER and told them I was having severe chest pains, my heart was racing out of control, pains shooting down my left arm, very sore back, neck and shoulders and my blood pressure was through the roof.

The nurses took me back to the triage unit because of my chest pain complaints and told me to remove my shirt and they ran a ECG-12 \[EKG\]. After that I was taken back to a room where I waited four hours as I watched my legs and feet tremble uncontrollably while I was suffering a racing heart, a blood pressure reading of 181/93 and I was in tachycardia with a pulse rate of 121. To my utter surprise my doctor entered the room and told me that I was being discharged and they could find nothing wrong with me and gave me a diagnosis of GERD \[basically acid reflux\] and prescribed me some Prilosec. I went home traumatized from that and I felt in the core of my being that it wasn't GERD and something much more sinister was happening to me. I was pretty traumatized the first two days being back home but on the third day I was super sore still and feeling something strange in my chest but continued to press on with my life that is until October 25th where I woke up with the exact same symptoms again and I was convinced they had to have missed something and off to the ER I went. I was released again with no issues found whatsoever.

October 28th come's around and the same thing happens again. At this point I am convinced they are missing something major and rush myself to the ER again. This time even the doctors are worrying and run more comprehensive tests and find nothing wrong again but this time they refer me to a cardiologist. In those three trips I had a CT abdomen scan with contrast, CT angio coronary scan, three chest x-rays, three CBC with differential tests, three comprehensive metabolic panels, they tested for any cardiac enzymes in my body, a COVID-19 test, three urine tests, D-Dimer test, magnesium testing, three GFR's and a 256 slice 3D model reconstruction of my heart. Every test came back normal to the point they said my heart and lungs look better than most other men in my age group even considering I smoke cigarettes. Over those three trips I racked up a hospital bill for the amount of $12,984.73. I'm on day 23 now since I last used and I am still filled with anxiety, I can feel my heart beating hard which I never even paid attention to what it was doing before but it has been obsessing me and my blood pressure has still remained high until my cardiologist \[which also says she can't find anything wrong, real surprise there and I literally had to beg for blood pressure meds\] prescribed me some blood pressure medication \[Losartan\] which is keeping my blood pressure pretty normal but not my pulse.

I'm running between 80-90 beats per minute which I think is a little highball for me and have had several tachycardia episodes since the last visit where my heart jumped to about 108bpm. The neck, shoulder and back pain are not nearly as intense as they were during the hospital visits but I still feel like someone flicks my heart, a feeling of someone grabbing my left rib cage and a fluttering feeling that runs though my left back shoulder \[more like a spasm\]. Every time my heart begins racing I'm literally sitting down doing nothing but using a computer or watching TV and I can only make it go away some my laying down and forcing myself to rest just to get my pulse back to between 80-90bpm and my left back is always sore after those episodes. I can't even drink coffee with sugar or a soda without pissing off my heart and this stuff has given me PTSD frankly.

The worst part is I could go a few days feeling mostly okay again just to have all this crap start back up again and strip me of my feelings of improvement. While some of the symptoms have improved the racing heart, soreness and fatigue are still there after quitting exactly 23 days ago. I'm really scared guys and while I would never wish this terror and misery on another human being \[it is so very cruel\] I'm hoping there is someone out there who has been through this and survived to tell the tale. I just need some love, support and stories of what you went through. Did it ever go away? How long did it take? Thank you so very much for taking the time out of your day to read this \[I really, really mean it\] and I'm really looking forward to hearing your stories if you have already been though what I am going through now.

I’m on my 5th attempt to quit weed. I’ve been on and off for two years already and had relapse many times but every time I do I realize how bad this habit is holding me back. The worst thing of quitting is that I don’t have the motivation to do literally anything during the first couple of months. I also feel like sometimes It’s difficult to talk about some topics that once I didn’t have any problems with. Like I cannot find the words to expresa my ideas or that I forget words or things that ai thought I learned. 

I’m in my second year of my master degree in political science and in this semester I am doing an internship which is online due to the covid situation. Unfortunately my supervisor is super busy and he is not giving me the attention that I would like so basically I’m putting almost any effort to the task I should be doing. In part this is because I don’t have the motivation and because it gets so hard for me to establish a daily routine.  I should be reading a lot besides Not having enough motivation I don’t remember the things that I read which makes me even more unmotivated. 

My question is, does it get easier with the motivation, focus and articulation of thoughts? Or did I already fried my brains out with the 10 years I’ve been a daily tocker?

Well, it has been 4 years with this problem and i'm realizing now how much damage i have done to myself, i'm 26 btw.   


Weeds makes me absolutely paranoid. It has deteriorated my life style, my relationship with people and got even worse with COVID-19. The distance with people, and being easy to ghost is leading me to being isolated, damn! is even making my everyday life an anxiety loop when i have to talk to anyone from my family in my house. because i'm ashamed, scared, i think every sound i make is too loud, i think i make my family  uncomfortable. 

When i smoke I got this thoughts about the house is gonna get robbed, i live in a quiet neighborhood, but  weed got me so afraid of everything that it got to the point where i trully believe that any engine sound that comes from the street is extremely  threatening, because in my mind i keep believing the car or motorcycle that pass through the neighborhood want to steal from us: doesn't matter if it is day or night, the anxiety and the fear will still come from the high, but at night it gets worse, because my mind says: ""is easier for people to rob at night"", so i get hooked to that thought feeling like is really gonna happen: this dudes are going to enter in the house and i have to defend it, so this cycle of thoughts keeps me in a really bad trip where the only thing i want is not being high anymore but still i keep smoking: and this goes on and on and on and on... It has been, for4 years.   


From here you can get the picture: this has lead me to no good. I'm 26 now, i keep struggleling to finish my psychology degree, i know what are my issues and that i have to overcome many things: basically grow up, really start making decitions for myself and the rest will be life being life.    


So got into therapy (CBT) and i decided this is the last fucking joint that i'll ever have again. 

¿You know what amazes me about all of this? : I did this to myself, i was the one who light that joint and repeat the process even when i was not enjoying it anymore, i feel like i have to build my life again, ¿why i didn't seek help earlier?

There's so much things to be done, but i will start slowly and willingly

The only thing i know: it's enough, i don't want this on my life anymore, it's destroying me and the ones i love...    
Sometimes we don't understand until we hit the bottom.

Thanks for reading this

The walls between me were tight and suddenly i lost all sense of balance and started drifting left and right as if i was drunk.

I finally got into my house which was where everything went to complete shit, suddenly i just felt emotionless... i started to panic as I genuinely felt like a sociopath, nothing felt like it mattered anymore, my future, my relationships even my morality i just felt meaningless, which then made me even more paranoid.

I've started so many tries on a break in the past year. I've been without weed for only 2 days but for some reason this time feels different. Kinda similar to my quitting smoking few months ago, then I knew in a week that I wasn't a cigarette smoker anymore and never would be though I had tried dozens of time before, I just new it would stick.

Now I feel the same way about weed, I have some cravings but internally something really shifted and though it tempts I don't surrender to the debate of it anymore, at all. It's just such a short time I feel weird being this sure. I had a dream in which I almost smoked but passed the bong from my hand cause I felt as I truly didn't want it.

I smoked for five years daily and am almost five months sober. I honestly have no ""desire"" or spark to do anything.

Since my withdrawals began, I spend an absurd amount of time just trying to figure out what I'm actually going to do (which game to play, which show to watch, to draw or not to draw) that my mind starts to feel defeated and tired and overwhelmed with all the options available to me. 

Tried cutting down the number of games i have installed and shows I'm watching to try to limit myself to lessen this problem. Also tried taking a week off from games and shows, but to maintain drawing skills i really do need to do it daily.

Anyone else feel this way? Tired, exhausted with choice, aimless, weighed down even when they're supposed to be unwinding?

I’ve been pretty much a daily user since I was 16 with a couple breaks here and there, and have always struggled with my mental health. Weed is so good at helping to alleviate my symptoms if I was feeling angry, depressed or anxious and I clung on to it as my ‘anchor’ for my mental health. During lockdown my mental state got worse, and my daily use went up, to the point there was no way I could do anything without getting stoned.
I had to take a step back and look at my cannabis use, because I always saw it as helping me. What I actually realized is that while it helps in the moment once I get stoned, over the course of my smoking (the last 8 years) it is overall detrimental to my mental health. Suppressing my emotions so I always feel numb and getting high to feel better made my negative feelings feel so overwhelming and that I thought I’d never be able to cope without weed. It tricked me into thinking I was too weak to cope on my own, but when I confronted my feelings I realized this wasn’t true. I guarantee to anyone out there struggling that you are stronger than you think you are.
Realizing weed was doing more harm than good, even though it seems like it helps was the most important step for me to quit. I haven’t been able to sleep before 5am this week and have spent most of it lying in bed but I’m starting to see the other side. I know I am strong and I know I can overcome this dependency.

[Recovery Thread],"Hello guys, so this year has been a huge roller coaster for me (and probably for many of you), and if you're reading this right now, probably you're trying to find a way to drop this plant, and actually start focusing on what really matters.

In case you want to know about my story and why I'm doing this, you can read my post that I wrote in r/leaves ([https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/joia2t/need\_some\_serious\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/joia2t/need_some_serious_help/))

I'm in no position at all of being all moral about this, because myself was a huge failure and relapsed over and over again, and even after I wrote that post about wanting to stop, guess what?... I just went and bought some more.

I promised myself that after I would finish my stash, I would stop being a whining little pussy and just embrace the change, and that's what I just did, I threw away for the first time everything I had connected to smoking (such as grinder, papers, lighters, etc etc) and I just quit cold turkey **yesterday**.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**Why am I doing this post?**

I smoked weed almost everyday for many years, and at the moment I wrote that post, I decided that I already wasted many years of my life in a cloud that lead me nowhere but just a bunch of laughter and pointless conversations. Life is so much more than that, and I want to be part of that.

If you've came already this far looking for help, it means that you already have the will deep inside you to drop, so, it's already half step taken! I just stopped, so you can still hop on board and share the pain with me, hoping that we can all make it through with ease.

It's not easy, trust me. But I'm craving the day where I will feel happy again, and not under the substance, and with this thread, I'm hoping we can all get the same support we need, discuss our recovery, and make it through.

Ive been lurking around this hood and read stories about many of you. Im the same. I dont want to admit it to myself but I keep doing the same thing which I promised myself last night, to leave alone this devil lettuce and start living the real life. Often time I do believe that I put my life on hold before I can actually “enjoy” my next task/acticity so I unpause and get carried along.

What can I say? 
Well, I do like smoke that thing, or atleast have THC inside my body for some time, eventually I get exchausted of it and go to sleep. Next day, perhaps I get even more THC In my body - might get a better hit now than ever.

My ride has started with weed when I was 17 introduced to it by my friend, who brought it with him, when we got together to hang out. 
First it was so disgusting and didn’t even like it.
After few joints and good laughs, this ride has been now riding for good 7 years.

Ive been smoking, ive been smoking, ive been smoking for so much time. So ungrateful for my body.  So so ungrateful. I hate that I can see it but Im not in control. 
I just cant get my hands off it, whenever its nearby.

Together, we share the taste of a noble feast, 

The carelessness of a child, 

The beauty of a golden song. 

You offer us the deal of all deals, 

The gift at no price, 

The doorway to simple satisfaction. 

A prey in your deceptive jaws, 

We fools are but blinded by our awe

To the real colours that are masked 

By your seductive persuasion.

You’re a dream too good to be true. 

Slowly, slowly

We begin to see more and more 

The bargain which we have unconsciously undertook.

Hidden behind our own denial,

Pretending we haven’t seen your second face.

You start to call more often

These are the prices to pay

To ride aboard your train.

The thought of a break-up enters our mind

But you turn that thought to stone 

And shun it like a fire burning wood.

Knowing that you’ve stolen the key 

To the doorway to a happy life.

Our food becomes bitter,

Our pockets become empty.

You beat us in your own deceptive game

Like the queen swallowing the pawn. 

We’ve given you more than we’d ever thought we’d give

And have been left empty-handed 

Like a thirsty man running in the desert 

To quench his thirst through his imaginary pond.  

How could we not have seen this?

Alas, this is the game you play, oh Mary, 

The game you play all too well.

Our depression flourished,

Our depletion grew,

And our fatigue thrived.

Our motivation was lost

Our money was burned

And our fire was extinguished. 

With you, the average day became dull.

The highs were mediocre

And the lows were abysmal. 

So deceptive is the game you play, oh Mary,

The game you play all too well. 

Incredibly blessed are we who realize this 

And make our timely escape.

Of enjoying a warm cup of coffee, 

And of sitting still in silence 

Remind us of what we’d forgotten

While deluded by your illusive fancy. 

Such is the game you play, Oh Mary, 

The game in which those unfortunate few 

Will be beaten until they see

Who you truly, truly are.

I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma when I was in the 8th grade and it’s followed me ever since. I’ve noticed since quitting weed that my asthma flares up almost five times a day, most frequently during the times when I would smoke. My lungs have become more sensitive as even running the A/C at 74 degrees triggers my wheezing. Depending on the day, I’m taking about 10+ puffs or more of my inhaler just to get it under control. Every night I’ve been having coughing spells and this cloudy clear phlegm comes up indicating that my body is trying to get rid of the toxins. This experience has truly taught me that I can’t take my lungs for granted....I could seriously die without my inhaler and I never realized the severity of it until now. I can’t even leave my house without my inhaler, I never used to be dependent on it before.

I’ve averaged about at least a gram a day off bong hits mixed with tobacco for about 4 years, but have been smoking for at least 6 years in total. 

I started smoking weed recreationally in high school and started at 16. Over the years I’ve smoked more  and gradually I couldn’t go a couple of hours without a  session.

I thought it was completely normal to be smoking the amount of weed I was smoking. I knew it wasn’t exactly the norm, but I felt generally accepted by society, and especially my group of friends when smoking had become legal in Canada.

Smoking weed would help me get through boredom, anxiety, and general physical body pains from working out in the past and currently bad posture.

For a long time I thought of weed as a neutralizing drug. I didn’t consider it a hard drug, so whenever I needed a boost of happiness or a break from anxiety from whatever I was doing/feeling, weed would be there for me, as my best friend.

However, it was only recently that I have  realized that weed had become the exact opposite. I’ve always relied on morning, and daily hits to help me get through the day, since I was always  excited to get high. But recently, my nightly hits made me suffer drastically.

The thing I depended on most to help relax or relieve my anxiety had made my heart beat faster, and made my paranoia worse which increased my anxiety. 
I could no longer go to bed feeling relaxed as I used to. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was going to die from a panic attack or heart attack. 

I’m currently 23 yrs old writing this post, and I’m glad to say that I feel like I’ve smoked enough in this life time, and generally do not want to smoke again.

The first week was the toughest. Couldn’t eat or sleep right, constant anxiety from getting used to being sober. I also think weed helped with my mild case of Tourette’s, since I felt like it got stronger when I stopped, or maybe I haven’t noticed it since I was always so high.

Although, the 2nd and 3rd weeks were a lot better. I was getting better sleep. Eating more food. And I was a lot less shy talking to strangers in public. I also feel like I have a lot more time on my hands. 
Whenever I feel anxious from boredom or being sober I usually focus on school, playing video games, listening to music, or working out.

Still getting used to being sober since I don’t have that automatic boost of dopamine I get from a bong hit. But I’ve come to realize that it’s completely normal to feel this way. No one is happy 24/7 and being uncomfortable at times is how we develop as human beings. It makes you think about the good and bad in life in a way you can’t when you’re high. This is the reason why I feel like some people who smoke weed all the time for 10 yrs plus can be so comfortable without progressing in life. I always felt like weed was a crutch to my personal development, but I never had the balls or strength to tell myself to stop. From reading this post you can basically say I stopped smoking out of fear.

I know this is super long and maybe kind of boring but what I really hope to accomplish with this post is to help people gain a new perspective, or reinforce their idea of quitting weed. This community was recommended to me by a friend and really helped me get through my journey, especially in the beginning when I was at my most vulnerable and emotional state.

Currently, I use this community, deep breathing meditation, prayer,  and the support of those closest to me like my siblings, friends and parents to help keep me accountable. I still smoke some cigarettes here and there but I plan to quit that in the future too, hopefully by the time I get more jacked from my workouts.

So basically I’d like to thank you all for helping me through my journey and I hope this post will help others who are currently on the same path. It’s not easy, but it can only get easier. Also if you’re currently struggling with your resolve, think of it this way. You know you’re not going to smoke weed forever, so why delay it.

Recently found this subreddit because of my best friend, and it already feels so good to have a community like this designed to help people get through tough times, knowing there’s people out there going through the same struggle. I’ve smoked habitually for about a year now, but it reached unhealthy levels after a bad break up. I found myself using weed in order to numb that pain, trying to forget her, but at the same time, trying to remember her as well. I would smoke multiple times a day, and it didn’t keep me from being productive, but I was able to take a step back and see just how dependent I was on weed. I’m only about 24 hours in, and I feel all the common symptoms of withdrawal, but I’m fighting. I realize I dug this hole for myself and I have to get myself out. If anyone has any advice for me going down this road, it would be much appreciated. We’re all in this together, and we’re all going to get through it.

Wanted to update you on my sobriety which I made two weeks! I want to thank everyone on here as I feel like I made it through what seems like a lifetime (but I’m only 23F so I know I’m over exaggerating considering I work with people who have been/are currently incarcerated for decades so I can’t compare anything to that). 

Anyway, I have to say that I still get crying spells but I think it’s a good thing—it means everything I suppressed during my smoking/vaping binge, has come to the surface and I am able to have that real, raw honesty with myself. So often times it is easy to deal with our issues through escapes, because we aren’t taught in our society the value of “rest” and self-care. Especially living in the U.S., the idea of constantly having to be productive is complete Bulls**t. The idea of having it “all together” is simply a fantasy because of so many factors and influences that affect our daily experiences. As a person who deals with severe, chronic depression and PTSD (also along with generalized anxiety disorder since PTSD is a form of anxiety), I’ve learned how liberating it can be to truly feel your emotions. Of course, if you are thinking of harming yourself or others, please receive/seek out professional help (the idea that you have to do it all alone is also not true and there is NO SHAME in getting professional help). We are going through a collective trauma (not just the U.S., but globally) and it’s time we do the internal work in a way that allows us to thrive and evolve into better versions of ourselves. 

With that said, even if it feels like it doesn’t get any better, it does. Have hope because for so long I felt like I didn’t have any and I wanted my existence to completely vanish. It doesn’t have to be this way, and it shouldn’t—nobody deserves to think like that. Some days it gets super hard like we have nothing left, but finding community (even if it isn’t your biological family) is so key. You aren’t alone, and even the most hurtful/painful experiences shall pass, and those that you will cherish and love the most will come. Just believe in yourself. 

I hope this helps someone out there even if it’s one person. Stay strong and stay safe ya’ll, I’ll be back with more updates.",9,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9895403981208801}"

Over the last 44 days, my moods have been chaotic, harsh, and snappy.  It's understandable; I'm getting off of a 17 year addiction, and my hormones are out of whack.  Most people have been very understanding and forgiving about it.  ...But not my ex-boyfriend/best friend.  He's not having it all.  He can't handle me.  He won't deal with me; he won't forgive me.  He won't even talk to me anymore.  He's broken off all contact.  He won't answer the phone or any text messages.  He's gone completely silent on me.  When I tried to visit his house, but he threatened to call the cops on me...like I'm some crazy stalker or something.  That's totally not who I am.  I just don't know what to do when I'm not given the option to explain myself or communicate.  He didn't give me a chance.  

The reason why he's upset is because I broke his trust out of anger.  He was getting very ill, and it was making me concerned.   I was so mad at him for being stubborn and not listening to me that I told his dad about the 18 chickens living in his spare bedroom.  There was chicken shit everywhere!!  The house was a health hazard and he was actively trying to get himself fired from his job.  Stoner me would not have texted his dad.  Stoner me would have been more patient, stepped away, smoked a joint, and offered him kindness.  Stoner me would have forgiven his stubbornness, forgiven the terrible mess and the terrible smell, offered him unconditional love and patience, and then none of this would have ever happened.

Everything was ok when I was smoking weed....everything except my health and my finances.  Sure, we'd get in arguments, but then I would smoke a joint and come back to him in a chirpy, happy, silly mood.  And even though he hated the smell of weed, he would hug me and show me love.

Being shut out of his life makes me feel like a worthless piece of trash.  I won't bother him anymore.  I'll give him his space.  But it's not fair.  I want to go smoke weed and make these terrible feelings go away. I desperately want the chance to fix this, but there is nothing I can do.  I have to allow him to block me out, because that's what he really wants.  :(  I'm about to cave in right now.  I could be in my car puffing and thinking of fun things to do with my life.  I could be out on some adventure with deep thoughts and inspiration.  But instead I'm sitting here thinking how worthless I am...how harsh I am...how much I fucked up on someone that I love...how no one will ever love me with my terrible mood swings.

It's amazing because once you get to a certain point you kind of stop counting the days/weeks. I just happened to open the Grounded app today and it marked 2 whole months. 

I am super proud of myself and I feel **so much better**. My mental clarity is night and day & I feel *waaay* sharper at work. I also feel happier as a whole.

One thing that quitting did was allow me to start working on my mental health instead of covering it up with substances. I have diagnosed OCD and GAD and finally started medication and seeing a psychiatrist a couple weeks after quitting. I feel better than ever. 

For anyone curious I am 22 and started smoking at 16 - daily multiple times a day since 19. I would go through about an ounce or so a month. The breaking point was when my mental health got so bad and I took a step back and realized weed was fueling the fire and not helping at all anymore.

My longest break before was 3 months but I wasn't treating my mental health or making necessary changes and eventually relapsed as a result of this. I feel stronger now and while I may get slight cravings, I realize that may quality of life has increased tenfold. 

Even though we're in a global pandemic, my desire to actually go out and do stuff is back! I used to be shut in 24/7 blazed and now I am past that point and want to see what life has to offer. The biggest thing is that my family has noticed a huge difference. Everyone says I am a lot like my old self and apparently to my parents it is like they have their old son back.

Cheers everyone, 2 months feels massive. If you are just starting or going through a rough point in your withdrawal, I promise you that things can and **will get better**. Stay strong and roll with the waves, I believe in everyone here.

After smoking for over 25 years, it feels pretty amazing to finally reach this milestone.    

Here's changes I've noticed now that I'm a year clean:

* I'm way less angry, moody, irritable, and depressed than when I was smoking.  My anxiety is much lower as well.
* I rarely have cravings.  I fantasize about weed from time to time, but haven't been at high risk of relapse.
* I'm overeating.  I loved binge eating when I was high and I think subconsciously my brain is still trying to get that dopamine rush from eating.   I plan to work on diet and mindful eating in this next year.
* I've been having a lot of tinnitus.  I don't know if this is a PAWS symptom or something related to my sinus/allergies or bruxism, but it's been pretty constant over the last month or so.
* My [sleep](https://imgur.com/a/cOmDNhQ) improved a lot over the year but has taken a step back in the last couple of weeks.  I'm back to having trouble falling asleep and am very restless while sleeping.  Like the tinnitus, I'm not sure if this is a wave of PAWS, symptoms of anxiety, or something else.  I have also been waking up with headaches for the last couple of weeks.  I thought it might be due to my night guard not fitting properly (I grind) , TMJ, or sleep apnea.  However, my dentist seemed to think its from a sinus infection so I got on medication and they seem to have subsided.

I've always said that withdrawal is like a declining roller coaster.  The symptoms go down and up and down all the while peaking lower and lower.  Ironically my sleep chart looks like the inverse of that.  The sleep quality has gone up and down and up, all the while getting better and better.

Hope everyone is taking care of themselves (if you are in the US) given the election that is still going on. 

Anyway, I just want to say I’m 12 days clean, and I havent have a single urge to use although I think about it from time to time. I do have random anxiety attacks, like this past Saturday night at around 4am. Since then, what I learned is to take things day by day and BREATHE. What has helped me is breathing in and out and focusing on that. Also, anxiety may manifest through physical symptoms like getting cold and sweaty, but as I focus on my breathing and keep telling myself that I will get through this, the anxiety doesn’t exacerbate—it has been a bit easier to manage. 

I recognize that everyone’s experience is different and I am definitely not like the majority of folks who have smoked for years, decades (I used heavily with vapes and tinctures from day to night for about 5-6 months). But even then, I experienced a lot of the symptoms people were explaining from withdrawals probably due to my underlying mental health conditions (PTSD and depression) in addition to my body’s built up dependence on weed. 

I want to thank everyone for sharing their stories as this has helped to remind myself that I’m not alone and that we can do this. I’ve made a promise to myself im a 23F, that I am going to take more care of myself and find healthy ways to cope. Take my health seriously as there is so much I want to do in this lifetime (not for the sake of others, but for myself).

I initially started with black market carts for a couple of months but moved to smoking flower and dispensary carts because I prioritize health concerns. Weed was something that really changed my perspective and made me happy when I had low points in life. I think I convinced myself that weed was a miracle drug and I still think it is, but I wanna quit because I don't wanna consume while my brain is still undergoing major development and I don't want my lungs to get ruined early on. When I first started smoking I was probably trying to get high all day, but I've matured a lot in the year since and my consumption rate is really not a big concern for me. For the past two months, I've made attempts to organize my smoking consumption from three times a day (once in the shower, sometime in the afternoon, and before bed) to most recently only smoking when working out and at night before bed. I really enjoy working out and see that it's something that's recommended as a past time to deal with weed withdrawals. My problem is that I've always been relatively skinny, not underweight, but let's say I've been about the same weight for like 5 years lmao- 135 lbs. I have a somewhat muscular build due to working out and having low body fat, but now that I've stopped consumption I'm pretty concerned about my appetite and weight. I'm only on day two of recovery, but I really have no appetite and I'm concerned that working out would only do worse for me as I would be eating up my own muscle. Since quitting I've already lost 6 pounds and I'm concerned it would only get worse from here. It is very hard for me to put on weight, but very easy for me to lose weight, and is something I've always been insecure about. I would like to get back to working out regularly but would like any advice on how to tolerate my lack of appetite. I've only been eating in small amounts like twice a day and although I feel hungry, I really can't eat, it's so unappetizing and I have no incentive to work out as of now.

I wanted to make this post just to keep myself honest in the next couple weeks, because today is another day 1.  Last time I quit in May 2020 and lasted a few months.  Before that first clean weekend I commented on someones post on leaves, who was also on their first few days.  I told that person I'd check back in on them after the weekend, and knowing that I was going to have to be accountable to someone else come Monday helped me abstain.  That person ended up deciding not to quit, so I continued on my own.  But, now I'm back at square one.  

  I'm 39, I don't have a family, I don't have a career, I don't have much of anything.  I finished all my classes for my masters degree in visual development three years ago, but I couldn't finish the final thesis because when I'm smoking, getting high is so much easier than focusing and being consistent over a span of time.  I look back and feel like I wasted my youth in a high stupor.  I always wanted to have a family, a career in the arts and kids one day, but now it feels like I missed the chance for those things.  I had advantages most don't and I took it for granted.

I can't imagine never smoking weed again, but it's clear I can't be a casual smoker, it just always ends up being all I care about doing.  I've quit a number of times throughout the years but last time the withdrawals were so bad.  I have so much anger and it all comes out once I stop medicating.  It's particularly focused on one family member who I feel wasn't there for me when I needed her most.  

I want to know what I'm like after a full year of not smoking weed, or 5 years, how far could I get if I never smoked again?

One thing I always remember after not smoking for a good chunk of time, it wasn't really the weed that kept me from staying focused on what I needed to do, it was always me that decided to relax and get high, rather that confront my issues and do work, rather than the bare minimum and then get high.  It still takes a lot of will power to get yourself off your ass and get to work, even if you aren't getting high.  Once sober, it's so hard to try night after night, continuing to push yourself harder than you might otherwise because you feel you have to make up for lost time.  I just want to actually get somewhere this time.  I can't keep working this dead end job, or living this lonely, mundane life style, I know I won't survive the dark depression of it forever.  I've already become a bitter person over the years from the stagnation.  

My parents are getting old, I know they won't be around for much longer.  I need to find the success for myself but they also deserve so much more than a weak-willed burn out for a son.  My Dad worked too hard to provide for his family for me to just waste all my potential.  I hope it's not already too late.  

God this week is going to suck, I'm about to go insane, get no sleep and sweat all night.  Well, I've gotten through it before and I know I can do it again.  The real test comes when I start to feel like I'm on my way and I've got some time behind me, then I start to think I deserve a night off, but I just keep falling into the same pattern.

23yo here. Just want to get some opinions from some fellow tokers on how y’all feel in social situations with weed. I smoked for the very first time in HS with some of my best friends and it was a grand ass time. I remember not having a care in the world and saying and doing what I felt like. For about a year or 2, it brought us much closer. Nowadays (more like years) I get an uneasy feeling when smoking with others. It doesnt happen every time I smoke, depends on how I’m feeling that day, who I’m with, what we’re doing. I’ll often get too into my head and start conversating much less, standing up for myself less, and thinking deeply about what other people may be thinking of me in a negative manner. I’m also more concerned about my body language and presence overall. It’s even worse if new people that I don’t know are there. And also worse if there are friends that are not high. I basically let my guard down and let them get to me. Sadly

I have a lot of uncertainty going on in life generally now so I’ve made the tough decision not to smoke for the time being. I just want to go back to enjoying seshes with the homies and being free. It’s a double edged sword because smoking if often how we meet up and catch up... except a part of me is hindered from socializing how I want to.

I'll start out by saying I am an extreme case. I consume close to a half oz to oz of flower a week and 6 grams of wax or more.  I go to the dispensary once a week and buy the same damn thing. I have for the last 3 years now.

I even checked myself into residential treatment for this, as I am a terrible alcoholic and I have just as much trouble quitting weed as I did alcohol. Weed was the replacement and has been that for me for the last 3 years. I'm genetically predisposed to the addiction of any mind-altering substance. My first drink was heaven at first sip and weed was love at first smoke. The hard part about weed is it's insidious. It has taken 3 years of me fucking up my life to get the point, and the negative aspects weren't apparent until they had snowballed.

Growing up I was always told weed in itself is not addictive, just habit-forming. After 3 years with a med card, and all the THC-A I can smoke. I don't see it that way anymore. I'll say it again. This is just as hard as quitting alcohol for me.

I'm only 20. But when you have unattentive parents who just hand you stacks of money and are left to your own devices, well, I at least didn't do a good job of being responsible with it. I don't have years of experience, but I went from having a great life handed to me on a silver platter, to a hole 10 ft deep. That speaks more volume about the situation then all the shit I put myself through and will put myself through if I continue on this path. I'm well aware of the results, I'm not that out of control or naive. The biggest problem is the growing state of acceptance in this stage of my life.

  After numerous outpatient attempts, 1 inpatient attempt, and many meetings, I've lost faith in Western Medicine. I was not forced into these, I willingly went out of pure helplessness. I'm unsure if the problem was me or the staff, but all I know is I didn't feel like I was being helped in any way. It just felt like a place to stay I know I wouldn't drink or get high, and I maybe saw a licensed physician once a week. The ""nurses"" however were atrocious and are the main people I interacted with on a regular basis. It's very clear they were there to finish a residency and get on with their careers. I only mention this because I didn't feel cared for, and they would often participate in arguments and gossip with patients. Some weren't even registered nurses, just rehired alumni of the program. I feel like it's easy for people to take the side of the facility because of the posh intake every place does and all the terrible testimonies that get taken offline. 

Nonetheless, I need help but feel like I can't get it. And that is one of the only forms of help that I was ever offered.  I don't know where to start. I feel trapped. I want to quit smoking so badly, and it is affecting my life even worse, but it feels like it's the only thing keeping my life somewhat on track. As it's an emotional rollercoaster and I feel completely out of control when I do stop.

The biggest thing for me is I don't sleep period. I will be up for 3 days at a time, only getting the sleep out of exhaustion. This is usually what pushes me to smoke again. By the end of the 3-day sleep purge, my mental state is far from stable and good. I cave so easily at this point.

With weed. I can still function, and get by. However, I know at my core that I can achieve so much more. That thought has become too much to toil with. It seems to be the only thing on my mind while I'm high. I can't numb it any longer.

I feel trapped because I know I can make it to a month or even two without smoking, I just always return to it at some point and go back down that same rabbit hole, because it's easy. It makes things feel more redundant and less progressive in that regard.

I recognize my primary desire to get high is to fill a major void in my life. And I will often take the easy route and get high. It is very easy to cope with negativity, it just doesn't go away. The negativity I harbor is holding me back from achieving so much and I know this because of how I was before pot. This is the turning point for me, as I can't move forward unless I conquer these demons. And I have no hope of being sober if I don't. I'm sure of it.

I also feel the need to make a new Reddit account to post on this forum every time I try again. It's so comical but I even feel a sense of shame typing things like this to a bunch of strangers who are going through the same things, I at least don't remember most names I see on here. I have a pretty warped thought process right now, I'm hoping to heal it.

I could make two separate posts, but I feel like someone can tie all of this together and relate to me. If anyone does, message me please. I've cast out most people in my life so I can smoke and I don't have anyone to relate to me on this level in general. Plenty of people can with alcohol, and that helps my alcoholism. Weed is a different type of animal to me and the main source of my struggles at this time. As you can tell I just need to talk to someone, but writing a novel for Reddit is sufficient enough right now.

This is my list of reasons to stop smoking, I'm having a hard time finding any reason at this point why I should keep smoking.

Because of weed........

\- I forget things mid-sentence.

\- I am mentally and verbally slow. (Socializing is torture)

\- I am short-tempered.

\- I can never permanently resolve negative emotion and thought, it never goes away. Just temporarily. Not even that now.

\- I've lost many friends I hold in high regard because I'd rather smoke than go out with them. They notice a major difference in me. They don't like being around me when I'm high. And no. Its absolutely not ""well fuck them, that's just their opinion""

\- I am 3 years behind in school while my friends are getting ready to finish their degrees.

\- I regularly cancel any plans so I can smoke, the social anxiety has also become too much.

\-I can't get enjoyment out of anything, even things I loved before. My passions feel dead to me.

\- I am emotionally withdrawn, and sometimes devoid of all emotions.

\- I am neglecting my long-distance relationship of 4 years, and I am creating a divide with my partner.

\- I am having a hard time even connecting with my partner on a verbally romantic level, I simply cannot feel the love at times because I'm so dulled out and out of control.

\- I have spent 50k or more (that's at least what my main dispensary told me when I took the time to look into it for once) 

\-I cannot save any of my money now and my entire savings has been depleted

\-I constantly feel hopeless, and the thought of the future is crushing.

\-I have lost a lot of muscle mass I worked so hard for in high-school and any exercise feels like death now

\-I will be in a constant cycle of what is described above, it will never go away, and I will never be able to smoke normally ever again.

\-I can't hold a job for more than 6 months

\-I don't get restful sleep, I'm constantly tired.

\-I vomit sometimes when I wake up and my appetite is non-exsistent anymore. Even when I'm high.

\- I have lost most of the things I love, including my self-respect

My addiction got steadily worse over the course of the last five years, but I ended up an all day every day stoner, any time I wasn’t high I wished I was. It got so bad toward the end. It wouldn’t kill me before I got to 20 years from now like other drugs would, but it would mean I’d have lost long term friends from not really listening to or being there for them/being completely unreliable, we’d have drifted apart over time as they learned they couldn’t count on me because I wasn’t really there. Obviously I wouldn’t have made any new friends, because my favourite thing to do was to isolate myself completely and just do nothing but smoke til I was completely numb. There’s no way my current or any other healthy relationship could survive active  addiction, so I’d be alone. I’d have been fired from any kind of job that needed me to focus or show up on time, so god knows what kind of job I’d be able to keep to keep a roof over my head. At the height of my addiction I had been coughing up black and brown gunk into the sink every day for a *long* time, felt like I was trying to breathe through a cardboard tube, my partner told me when I slept it sounded like I was drowning, lots of people had told me my constant cough sounded really fucked up and I didn’t care. My lungs were painful all the time and I kept smoking. I could easily end up with COPD or chronic bronchitis and in 20 years be wheeling around a little oxygen tank and knowing my lung function will get progressively worse until I die. 

The worst part about this grim picture is knowing I’d eventually have had to get sober anyway, no matter what, from lack of money or lack of access to weed. It’s illegal here and your dealer’s gotta get arrested sometime, and with no job I wouldn’t have been able to afford to buy weed on the internet either (if that would even still be a possibility two decades from now) so what would I do like, start stealing to buy 20 bags? I’d have ended up sober sooner or later, or become an alcoholic as a next best alternative. 

It seems like weed is something that won’t kill you dead in the immediate short term, like a lot of drugs will, so it doesn’t require that absolute nihilism from an addict who isn’t capable of caring whether they die, but it’s insidious and it will just steal your life from you slowly so you might not even know that it’s happening until it’s too late. 

I’m really glad I’m getting sober now while I still have all the makings of a decent life and the chance of doing work I can feel proud of, instead of pissing it away and ending up looking around me when I’m 50 and I’m finally out of weed for good and everything I have now is gone.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989344477653503}"

I cried this morning after a particular dream I had last night.","I've read multiple times in my life that smoking doesn't allow you to get full REM sleep and I would always scoff at it. I've been smoking, very, very heavily, for longer than a decade and I would have dreams but they'd always be vague and I'd easily forget the details. 
I've been sober for about a week (beer has been a struggle for me, too, but last night was the first time I didn't drink- I'm not a heavy drinker, just like to get a good buzz, but I want to be a healthier person for myself and have a better grasp on my addictions so I'm in more control of my life). I think I get mostly paranoid about not being able to sleep without some form of inebriation- insomnia is the worst and I had a pretty bad bout of it in my early 20's- but I really feel I've just been making excuses so I just tell myself to shut the fuck up and relax and that's been working pretty solidly. I still wake up 2-3 times a night, but ironically I still feel more rested than when I was passed out for the entire night after smoking. 

This summer I had to put one of my cats down and it was incredibly- incredibly- difficult for me. I realized last week that, upon so many other things that have happened in my life, I've been repressing my feelings about it very heavily with smoking.  I suddenly felt flooded with emotion, started sobbing, and realized that was the first time I really allowed myself to grieve the loss. 

Last night, my first truly sober night in a long time, I had a dream about her. It was incredibly vivid and honestly, very spiritual for me. I won't go into details, but I really feel like I wouldn't have been able to experience that if I were still smoking (or drinking). I feel very grateful that I was able to see her and that it felt so real. 

I guess that's just it. Dreaming- like, actually dreaming- is a whole new world for me. I love it. I love being in touch with myself and my spiritual consciousness. 
I never, ever thought I'd say this-- even just two weeks ago I probably wouldn't-- but I feel like I've outgrown weed and it's just not something I need or want in my life anymore. I'm excited by my personal growth and I can't wait to continue this journey.

Step 1. I wrote “ I do not want to smoke” then rewrote it as “ I am sober “. I did this to reflect that this isn’t just about weed. It’s about completely changing my lifestyle.
Step 2: i mediated on “ I am sober” day in and day out. I want to stay sober so therefore from on out I AM sober. IF THE AURA OF WEED HAS ENTERED MY PRESENCE MEDITATE. At the moment I sense weed (smells, pictures, etc) I start mediating. 

I do this to link “I am sober” to weed in my mind. Eventually, Everything becomes automatic. As weed pops up randomly in my life so does “I am sober” like an automatically combating it. 

That’s the method

Just for example:

I use to smoke with my boys everyday. I don’t want to stop chillin with them because I love them and I don’t want our relationship to crumble over weed. So I went. As soon as I get to their door it’s Loud as hell. So Started meditating. It felt like that night was a test. I spent a couple hours talking, having fun, and mediating. If the desire to smoke started creeping up I would acknowledge the impulse then kill it with “I am sober”. 

No thing can control you. You know who you are.  You have dreams that have turned to dust due to smoking your brains out and now you want more out of life. They best time to quit is literally right now in this moment because we both know you thought to yourself “I don’t even want to smoke the rest of this, I’ll finish them never smoke again”. I did constantly yet I always had a blunt in hand.

I’ve been trying to quit since I was 19. I’m now 27. I didn’t find r/leaves until recently, but I know people who have quit and I probably haven’t tried hard enough. I’m on Day 1 as I write this post (the last day 1). 

I wanted you all to know that while I enjoyed my 20s smoking, I could’ve enjoyed them A Lot more if I didn’t smoke. 

Less anxiety, more relationships, more confidence, bigger social network, less isolation, less video games/junk food (great for Saturday nights, not all nights), better grades, better physical shape, higher paying job, a job I actually enjoy, a clean house, a nicer place than where I live now.

Those are what I missed out on because of weed. What did I get in return? Short periods of being high, anxiety, chronic smoking affecting work, awkwardness and loss of self confidence around women/guys who intimidated me, a beer belly, excess spending on carry out food because I was too anxious to pick it up myself (cross paths with another person), an unclean, smelly house.

Don’t be like me, be stronger. If I could go back 5 years I would take it all back and do it over again, sober. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE ME!!!!! Be strong!!!!! Do not smoke!!!!!",705,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6580440402030945}"

So currently I am 19, I smoked weed from 16-19 years of age. I decided to pick it up because I was bored and thought it would be cool, when I was 17 in junior year of high school I started to smoke sooo much, my friend got me into smoking buying ounces because he said it would make the weed-free, that is the biggest mistake never trap. This leads me to not only lose all my money but to become a chronic smoker, I would smoke 5+ times a day every day until I was about 19. The biggest issue is to see how it stopped me, It killed my body, make my bones weak (the carts) and made me just overall not achieve the goals I could have sober, this would make normal things better at the time. When I turned 19 I told myself things must change, I must get my life together. This lead me to many attempts at being sober, 50+ attempts until after a while I fully quit In July. From there august, September, October were all months of no smoking.... then two days ago my friends picked me up, leading up to this I was having dreams and urges to smoke, every time I would see my friends who smoked nothing would happen I was able to resist but I felt these cravings more and more. 3 days ago was my breaking point, I smoked... I felt great, on top of the world, my thoughts were racing, I had all these great ideas and felt like I knew what I had to do to achieve success, then I woke up and bam.... it was all gone, I felt this feeling of a headache its has been two days were my head hurts and I lost all my energy. I can not think straight, my brain is foggy, and I do not find as much enjoyment in learning as I used to, these drugs and weed, listen if you quit once just don't do it again.  


I am now on a scientific study, my friends call it stupid but it is a 5 year study..  


I am writing down everyday and how I felt sober for 5 years, I want the effects of weed on your mind after quitting for 5 years. Be safe and if you ever feel like wanted to smoke again its not worth it, it will bring you back to where you started, all those headaches, nights without sleep, the lazyness, all of that that you felt within the first few months of going sober hit you at once, and this new headache does not go away, it wills stay, it is not fun. Fight it, if you cant fight it then smoke, but the weed is not as fun as you think.

I went to play video games but the anger overcame me towards my gf. I decided to go for a walk and just beathed fresh air instead of weed.
At home again i just instantly fell asleep/played i was asleep to avoid argument because i knew this will be bad if i'm starting to blame her for breaking our promise.
I've been smoking for 5 years and 2 years daily. Although i've quit a dozen of time it never felt thia real to quit like now.

I hooe i can get my girlfriend on the path i am, otherwise i'll do anything in my power without abusing her to make her stop using weed. She doesnt have aa much opportunities to smoke becazse u was the main supplier for us both.

It was a really desperate ""last joint"" we didnt have amything on us and smoked everything we had left in the grinder and weedtable.


I think something that made me really think this time will be the last ist that we had a laat joint game, where after every hit we'll tell each other why we wanted to quit weed.
- it makes me not want to clean the house and be fine with it
-i dont feel like i want to be a part of the weed community anymore, because most weedsmokers (like me) are delusional to the concept of happiness
-i dont even know if i've really processed my ex. Not rlly ex but a really bad experience with a women which made me smoke weed daily to stoo thinking about it because objectively it was just a no no situation

It's funny, I hype myself up to quit and then it crumbles in my own mind.  See my life went to shit multiple times and I struggled with alcoholism badly to the point my (now) wife was going to leave me.  That's when I made the switch to dope in 2016 and my life changed instantly. 
My relationships improved, it was cheaper, I felt better with no hangovers, depression was almost nonexistent and it really helped me through multiple bad years. 

Fast forward to 2020. The benefits have dwindled and marijuana has become like cigarettes for me. I use roughly an ounce a week (slightly less) and spent upwards of $5,000-$6,000 a year on it.  I only really feel high first thing in the morning, then smoke at work and tons in the evening just trying to achieve a similar feeling. It's gotten so bad, I wake up almost nightly and have sesh at 1-2 am just to sleep the night through. 

I'm a father of two and I want to just be sober and sober for my family.  I've never been sober my entire adult life. I want to achieve greater things in my life. Pot has been an excuse to not do anything and feel okay with it.

(thought experiment),"So I recently found myself doing this and it helps me a lot. Might be a bit obvious, but if it can help just one other person its worth posting.

Today I was taking a walk through the woods were I used to smoke a lot. Its late morning right now and the sun was shining and autumn just looks beautiful right now. This immediately triggered my addict-brain to crave weed. (familiarity and stuff, you most likely know what I mean).

The Tip is to think about what happens in the hours and even days AFTER smoking. Like many of you I actually just crave rolling up, sitting back and sparking up. The first minutes after smoking can be fine too, but whats after that? I can tell you what happens with me after that:

&#x200B;

\- I am glued to the ground with a dry mouth and forget about time

\- I become disconnected from my surroundings and feel even weirder about running into other people on my way home

\- I stumble around at home, I smell of weed and I feel kinda dizzy

\- before smoking I told myself I would ""relax"" but as soon as Im high I will hyper focus on a task while being too high to actually accomplish anything (for me thats mixing a song, which I still really suck at)

\- after doing that task for several hours no-break (while not getting anything done because I get hung up on stupid things) I will eat a ton of food (way too much). its probably junk food too

\- now I will feel bloated, tired and kind of out of it, probably about to take a shower

\- after taking a shower I will go to bed (probably eat some more) and stay up way too long watching (perhaps even interesting) stuff BUT: Im way too faded to keep anything in my head and Im probably paying more attention to some stupid thoughts going crazy in my head

\- its probably at least 3 am now and falling asleep isnt really a thing: i fall into a coma. no idea when and how I fell asleep, my tv is probably still running and I wake up feeling like shit

\- now Im not high anymore but Im definitely still faded/ out of it and I feel numb but nervous. (does anyone else get that? just waking up nervous after smoking?) also my body just feels weird and I can tell that I ate way too much crap last night as my stomach is aching

\- my motivation is fucked for the rest of the day and probably even for the week as my brain is struggling to adjust its chemical balance. With one night of smoking I have just sabotaged my entire week, if not more.

\- ""oh wow, its evening already! time to smoke again!""

&#x200B;

yeah, no thanks. This is seriously ALWAYS how it goes. ALWAYS! Why would I do this to myself?

Im 23 days sober today and in the last couple days my sleep and the nights have become amazing again!

People say they use weed to sleep but it really fucks with your R.E.M. sleep cycle (you know, the important part of sleep, the one you also dream during).

Meanwhile I would always stay up way too late and then fall into a coma that would feel like I just skipped the night. No memories, no dreams, no rest.

Now I struggle staying up past 11 or 12 pm and I actively fall asleep. I dream and I feel rested in the morning. When I currently smoked I'd struggle to sleep for more than 6 hours and I would wake up feeling nervous (probably waking up BECAUSE I was nervous). Now I can sleep for 8 hours EASILY which was IMPOSSIBLE for me before.

This got kinda long, but I hope that thought experiment can help you as much as it helps me. Seriously, as soon as I just think a couple steps ahead it makes straight up not want to smoke instantly!

i’m committing to sticking around here, going to the daily group discord meetings, trying to help other people here too if i can, actively working on my sobriety and not letting myself get complacent or underestimate how easy it is to get pulled back under.

   Anyways, after reading so many posts I started to see the plethora of similarities we all seem to share and was curious if this resonates with anyone. 

After my first time attempting to quit (about two months sober) and after I relapsed back to our insidious old friend the high never felt the same as it did before. It wasn’t just about my tolerance being lower that affected me different but it was more mental. I felt anxious (though I didn’t before the two months sober), the high felt messy and almost chaotic, I couldn’t focus high anymore, I couldn’t read high anymore, and so much more that wasn’t previously plaguing me. It was almost as if that two month break change entirely how weed affected me. Or maybe my perspective of weed had changed and therefore my high did as well.

So I quit for two weeks, and experienced some withdrawl symptoms like insomnia and nausea (just the first days, then I began to feel great). Then I came back to smoking last week, and now I'm off for two days, and I feel sooooooo fucking lonely. I feel very disconnected from everyone, its like no one gets me and I dont get anyone. I didn't feel this the first time I quit, and I'm not really sure its a withdrawl symptom, I think it's just me.

Day 1:
    Negative
-stomach ache/nausea/acid refulx (all day).
-bad mood swings (rage during video games, anger/frustration at gf over insignificant shit).
-difficulty sleeping, lots of tossing and turning.  (Dreamed of being tortured to death in my 6th grade class room).
-frustration at myself for not having more control (which ultimately led to me self-imposing a hard-stop on weed).
    Positive
-Initial feelings of positivity/hope (immediately following throwing out ALL of my gear)

Day 2:
    Negative 
-Basically rinse and repeat of day 1 (nausea/stomach pain/short temper).  
-Additional anxiety/paranoia associated with upcoming election.
-Motivation to continue my hard-stop on weed drops significantly.
-Sink into depression (self-hate from feeling unable to fight/control my urges-while remembering/missing good past smoke sessions).
-meaningless fights with gf...over nothing.
-fear that I have developed a irreversible (paranoia) reliance upon weed to control my emotions and assistance with eating.
    Positive
-feel positive about at least having taken a day off (my first in months/maybe even a year +)
-sleep was significantly better-no horrific nightmares.

Day 3
     Negative
-still a lot of rage-especially with video games.
-defeatist mindset sets in regarding future of my 'hard stop on weed' (ie maybe it won't be a permanent break, maybe I'll just aim for Thanksgiving?)
-anger/jealousy seeing others enjoy weed. 
     Positive
-Significantly less stomach pain/nausea/acid reflux.
-slept through the whole night, still tossing and turning but not as much according to GF.
-good convos with my gf, made her laugh more/harder than I have in a long time (saw her look at me in a way she hasn't in months).
-significant improvement to my attitude at work and the work I produce.

I'm 17 now, and over the last year and a half weed has been apart of my daily life, and even has gone as far taking over my personality. After school got cut short due to covid, I took it as the perfect opportunity to up my smoking game, so I got a job. I basically was working 5 days a week, 6 hours a day just to spend my entire paycheck on weed. At its worst, I was smoking an ounce a week and started neglecting relationships with my family and friends. Eventually, no amount of weed could satisfy me, and I always wanted more. It was on my mind 24/7, and I couldn't enjoy life without it. I looked terrible, and I felt miserable. The life that I thought would be so fun didn't live up to its hype, but I couldn't stop. 

The turning point was when I got results for a psychiatric evaluation after being high for pretty much five months straight, and found that my long term memory retention decreased dramatically. Fortunately, I can build this back up the longer I stay sober. After that, I quit and never looked back. 

There are times when I really do miss smoking, but comparing myself to how I felt before, I wouldn't even consider it. Ever since I quit smoking, my overall mood is much better. I'm doing better in school, and I've learned to enjoy life sober. I've taken up hobbies such as meditation, reading and working out, and distanced myself from friends still trapped in that lifestyle.

Over two months ago, I left a 7yr toxic and abusive  relationship with someone who I thought was my best friend, lover, and who I thought was going to be my life partner. 

I’ve had a lot of situational stress and depression with school, work, and especially the loss of my relationship. It has been hard. I keep reminding myself that these feelings are better felt sober than numbing them and putting them off because no matter what I will eventually have to deal with them. I’m grateful that I can deal with life with a clear head. I feel I have a better sense of control knowing I am not using drugs and I am instead working on my dreams and goals. 

I have read on here that around this time cravings do come back and they may come and go for a long time. I got over this first wave of wanting to cave in and I am determined to combat the feelings if they come again. 

I am a 23 y/o female and I was a daily, chronic, and addicted smoker for 8 years. I have avoided 174 joints and have saved $871 since I quit two months ago (according to the “grounded” app).

Sleep is probably the biggest thing at the moment. I'm getting probably 2 hrs then wake up then sleep again for 2hrs on and off throughout the night. 

At first I was worried about that and that I would be completely shattered but I'd actually say that even though the sleep is disturbed I feel more rested and refreshed the next morning than if I had had some weed to sleep through the night.

The cravings are no longer in the pit of my stomach and driving my thoughts they seem to be more controllable at this time.

Appetite is reduced but no nausea so that's good. 

Temp control is a bitch and I often find myself hot but cold or vice versa for a few mins in the day. 

I do feel more connected to what's happening in the day and more alert and my memory has returned with a punch. I am randomly remembering figures of things that I read a few days earlier.

I was convinced that because I understood the grip it had on me I would be able to self-regulate and not become dependent.

I was wrong.  My ""rule"" of once a week was out the door as soon as I got home with the weed.  Soon I was smoking every day.

I get a couple attacks a day and they don't last more than half hour usually.

I am starting to be able to focus on little things now, like the shapes of clouds, the patterns on my clothing fabric, pebbles on the ground and just overall things that looked fuzzy near the start. It's definitely getting easier. 

Work was amazing today. I feel so fulfilled, I got a $15 tip too for my hard work which made me feel even better. Music is also starting to sound amazing again and I can hit play on my spotify again. I haven't been able to tolerate much music as I've been a sketched out motherfucker lol.

The past 2 weeks, a lot of symptoms I dealt with in month 1 have resurfaced. I was doing somewhat fine during the 4th month up until halfway thru month 5. As fucked as it may be, I’m still aiming towards feeling better by 8 months. PAWS is still here. I’m also not saying this just to feel good about this wave, I’m saying this because I genuinely feel like the worst of it is now passing me by & I could really see some more light real soon. Not hopeful, but confident. 

Right before this wave, I was finally managing to sleep a full 7-8 hours uninterrupted, it was great. I would wake up feeling bleh but knowing I slept through the night made it all worth it. As of right now, I have stomach discomfort, sleep disturbances similar to the ones I had in months 1-4, body aches & weird pains, muscle spasms, brain fog that comes & goes, & some lingering anxiety. Not to mention my eye floaters seemed to peak a while back but are still very present, just very weak. I’ve begun to practice the Wim Hof breathing technique, & found this does wonders for me. I love it. 

Some positives: 
Tinnitus subsided down to barely anything. It was actually triggered by a clogging in my ear canal after years of not properly cleaning my left ear. It affected my right ear as it slowly became my strongest ear. I had a crazy hand twitch on my left hand that has gone, but randomly starts on my right hand; nothing too wild. Most of my PAWS is physical, so I’m hoping it all fucks off from now until the new year. 

I’m staying positive through it all. I never felt like I lost myself mentally or emotionally. I laugh & feel the joy of laughter in my belly, I smile & it may cause some facial spasms but I feel the happiness behind it.. I know my breakthrough is right there for me. I’m just crawling my way over. I hope that by the year, I should no longer think of this or deal with it anymore.

I finally went cold turkey in June and have resisted temptation many times since; just yesterday I was the only one not smoking among a bunch of friends gathered. 

Well, now I’m just in a terrible head space, and I feel like there’s nothing I can do to relax. It feels too cold and dark for outdoor exercise (bad excuse I know) and I just really want to shut my brain down. 

I’ve got stuff to do. My car still isn’t unpacked from the weekend road trip. I need to clean it out and vacuum it so I can drive over to the swing state next door and help get out the vote.

Honestly, the beginning was really hard. This is a real addiction (not just habitual), and I felt very sick with flulike symptoms for a full two weeks (got 2 covid tests because I thought it could be that).    


For me, quitting looked like this:   
1. Crisis moment, decided to quit  
2. Two weeks of feeling sick   
3. Two and a half weeks of sleeplessness   
4. Finally started to feel better around week 3   
5. A month in, began to feel proud, healthy and more optimistic.   


Since I quit I've saved a bunch of money, felt my self esteem go up, lost a bunch of weight, and generally feel happier with myself and my choices in life.   


Biggest piece of advice I would like to share is: take baths! The hardest part for me was the sleeplessness. It really is torture to be sleep deprived, so finally after more than two weeks of no sleep, I went to the drug store and bought some lavender-scented epsom salts. I replaced my nighttime weed-smoking habit with a hot bath. These salts really relaxed my body and the aromatherapy was nice too. I even came to love the ritual just as much as the evening joint. This solved my sleeplessness problem. Hope it can help someone else too!

I picked it up from a shitty boyfriend who was a stoner. I was fresh out of wrecking my young marriage, abandoned by my friends and family and very, very ill with OCD. Then came weed. It made me feel...normal? Sure I loved the yummy high, but more than that I loved that it made everything feel less jagged. I thought it just smoothed out my emotional state. What I didn't realize is that it was making me numb and foggy. So I spent a decade high. I got high to cope with everything. Even when I stopped getting the feeling of being high I smoked. Just the ritual of preparing a joint or a bowl would be soothing. Things were fine for a while. I could work and go to school with no problem. But slowly things started to change. I didn't feel the yummy high anymore so I would smoke more and more. I started to get lethargic and shirk my responsibilities. I wanted to quit but never could stick to it. 

Then I started dating S. He was everything I dreamed of. I felt like I had finally found a truly good man to spend my life with. When we were living apart I could hide my weed usage. But once we moved in together and covid hit that became impossible. He went from seeing me smoke socially or right before bed, to seeing me smoke from the minute I woke up. I couldn't hide it anymore. And S got worried. 

We had a hard and honest talk last night. He's not angry or upset at me, he's worried. I'm angry at myself for holding on to such a stupid habit. I'm disappointed that I was on my way to jeopardizing the best thing that's ever happened to me for a drug that doesn't even get me high anymore! I hate myself for putting weed before our relationship. So it stops now. After crying my eyes out and wallowing in self pity last night I threw all my stuff out. S sweetly told me he didn't need or want me to quit, just to cut back. But I know myself. If I have it around I'll smoke it, so out everything went. 

I don't know if this will be forever. I don't even know if I can quit 100%. My mom and dad have become big smokers too and they spark up every family get together and it's a weird thing to have a bond over but I'm just glad to have something with them again.

Most people I know that are chronic daily smokers do have dark eye bags, dry and dull skin and discolouration around your mouth & lips. When I was smoking daily my skin and eye bags were at its absolute worst, this was heightened by the munchies filled with dairy, fats and carbs.

I’m new here (I have never used reddit before) and this is my first time here. I first want to say, whoeever made this community has honestly helped tremendously and especially seeing what everyone has shared, I think its amazing to see a community so supportive and encouraging (in a positive way). 

Not really sure where to start, but I’ll start with saying that I’m not really like the majority I see on here who have used weed for years (I actually used for six months pretty heavily from day to night). I smoked, vaped, and used tinctures. I actually have been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and have been hospitalized for suicidal ideations. I used weed to cope with all of that and especially given a recent experience I witnessed over the summer where my mother experienced a life-threatening overdose (she is alive and well and actually stopped using alcohol altogether). But after this incident, My use became more heavy and I would find myself still using depite it having negative effects—panic attacks and shaking due to using too much. 

I began to realize I had an unhealthy relationship with weed as I smoked and I had the same exact thing happened. But it wasn’t just that, I also came to terms with the fact that I was fucking up my lungs and my body by using in addition to my brain (and my ability to cope with my mental health conditions in a healthy way that didn’t involve substances). 

I made the decision to stop completely at 10/24/20. As many have mentioned, the first couple of days were hell—I experienced a panic attack and then flu like symptoms. I had chest pains and trouble breathing (I felt like I was literally going to lose my life, but clearly it was my health anxiety and feeling something was wrong with me. My symptoms like the chest pain and breathing and panic attack (associated with heart palpitations and increased heart rate) significantly got better after 3-4 days. 

BUT, at 10/31 (Halloween) I began to have another episode of my heart rate increasing, palpitations and ultimately insomnia. It’s day 10 and I haven’t been able to sleep for more than 3-4 hours—is this normal? I’ve been trying to deal with withdrawal symptoms on my own since I live with my mother and do not want to worry her—is there any advice to perhaps cope with all of this (and in a way that I don’t worry her as we both are trying to mend our broken relationship for the past 3-4 years). 

I’m sorry for the ramble, but everyday it seems like such a battle—I didn’t think weed could make me have withdrawals like this and would be great to have some support as I threw away all of my vapes and flower. I want to start anew and break the cycles of intergenerational trauma that unfortunately many of us are left to deal with as children and growing up. It’s time we find healthy ways to cope and heal, it sucks that breaking these cycles are no easy feat, but it’s worth it in the long-term for future generations.

I’m in a really rough spot right now. I’ve been at this point so many times before but I’m so terrified to finally give it up and start living again.

I’ve been a heavy daily smoker for 2 years. I’m at the point that I’m spending $250-$300 a month on weed just for me, pulling it from my savings so my husband won’t notice. My coughing and wheezing is severe, and half the time I end up vomiting. None of this stops me. I’ve tried edibles, but I just end up using high dosages and blowing too much money. I’m almost always high, I can’t cope with my day to day. 

I tried to quit once, but only made it 4 days before I broke down sobbing and shaking, irritable and lashing out. I’m absolutely addicted and dependent. 

What do I do? How do I stop doing this to my mind and body? 

I know there is a small discord chat on this sub, but I cannot make the times. AA helped with alcohol, and I was working on quitting weed too, but then the in person meetings got canceled. I don’t know what to do, but I know I need major support from people who get it.

I'm quitting for me now. It's hurting me too much and I need to stop. 

Usually I avoid the withdrawal stage by cutting down slowly. But I never fucking stick to it.

I endured all the typical symptoms of weed withdrawal like usual you know; no sleep, crazy dreams, appetite suppression, anger, sadness, etc. While this was not my first experience with quitting I’ve found something that is making this attempt force out my regression risk and keeping the best version of myself out at all times. No joke, being here now at 2 months and 20 days or 81 days weed free. I couldn’t have made this as successful and self improving without also now being 595 days alcohol free! Seriously, in past attempts I’ve found my drinking pick up where my smoking has decreased and relapse at a far higher risk. Nothing would fix a hangover for me like weed so sure enough the two ended up bring out each other. I also managed to quit nicotine for 1.5 months as well, but no joke this has made my progress superior. In these 81 days, I’ve successfully started a new job at a hospital, got in the gym 3-4 times a week, saved a small fortune to buy my girl an engagement ring and still have a decent some left over, refocused on finishing my business degree and getting a nursing license, and handled some of things I start using some of this stuff to cover up on the first place. Still much more progress coming every day, but in less than a 1/4 of the year I did this.. how could I jeopardize myself again when I know it only takes one “toke” and the cycle begins all over again.

1. Costs me a ton of money ($25/g over here) 

2. week long binges / I abuse it 24/7 / always use way too much 

3. Days/weeks/months go by really quick

4. My memory becomes terrible 

5. Everything becomes an excuse to smoke / smoke whenever no one is in the house. 

6. I isolate myself more

7. I stop helping around the house

8. It affects cognition short and long term, as well as my development as a 21 year old

9. I’m not productive / make progress with hobbies
  
10.I become moody and depressed. I’m meaner when I haven’t had my weed yet that day and become difficult to live with. 

11. I gain a lot of weight / eat way too much

12. I forget to take my medication 

13. I sometimes forget to brush teeth

14. I use impulsively and compulsively 

15. My sleep pattern gets fucked

16. I’m way less physically active 

17. It messes with my medication 

18. It worsens my bipolar mood swings, ADHD, paranoia and anxiety. Very illegal and frowned upon over here contributes to this. 

19. It becomes my primary source of happiness, which is terrible, as it causes so much unhappiness 

20. I have to compromise my values and morals at times, for example lie about what I did last weekend etc to family 


I wrote this list as after a few weeks off I convince myself that it’s okay to start again and I’ll control my use, but then the cycle repeats. This has happened like 30 times over the past 2 years, and it’s the exact same thing every time. I’m sure it’s cost me easily more than $10k and I already have student debt. I want to improve my life and make progress and this is incompatible with this lifestyle. 

Weed feels so amazing to me. The adrenaline rush and instant great mood is way too addicting. Orgasms are extremely powerful, food and music is amazing. A lot of my friends don’t describe weed as that euphoric compared to how I feel on it. This worries me as all of these are signs of addiction. It’s time to take control of my life. Been sober for 2 weeks, I feel okay, and when I get the itch I need to read over this list as a reminder.

I've been smoking for the past few years (started when I was about 16) on and off again. For over the past year, my smoking habits have gotten really bad. It has gotten to the point, with working from home due to covid, that I get high all day. I'm able to do my job and live my life, but I know I'm not myself anymore. I know I'm not productive, make bad choices when I'm high, and just generally am not living up to my potential. I'm high when I go see friends, and they don't even know. I've tried taking ""breaks"" from weed a couple of times in the past year to try and break up the frequency and quantity that I use, but I just built back up to the same amount (really quickly) each time. 

I need to quit, and I want to quit. I'm not buying more. I'm just scared. And I'm embarrassed. How is quitting weed so hard? I know I'm going to miss it, and I think that's the hardest part. 

I'm going to get rid of my stuff today, wish me luck. Part of me really wants to hang onto my pipe and grinder because the evil voice in my brain is telling me that one day I'll be able to handle weed in moderation.

It didn't really have an impact on my life and I just saw it as a way to relax with friends, have some fun playing video games.

My friend is a very heavy smoker and smokes 4-5 joints every day. Fast forward, all the work I put into my hobby paid off and I landed a job in the US, employer paid my visa, literally paid my rent and food to get my across the ocean.

My colleagues smoked, so they invited me to smoke the first week I got there and this ended up becoming quite a habitual thing, basically once work was done we would all hang out in a large group and enjoy the evening smoking.

After a few weeks/months of doing that I realized that I began craving it and basically ended up smoking every single day to the point where I would smoke before getting to work and basically right after work.

Ended up getting laid off because I became so lazy that I hardly did any work (very deserved that they laid me off) got sent back home and that incident basically crashed my life.

I'm now back in my regular 9 to 5 office IT job in a new city that I dont know anyone in and due to covid I have barely any chance to go outside and actually meet people. I have no future goal after losing that job, still smoke weed every day to deal with my loneliness/sadness/depression. After having suicidal thoughts for the first time ever last weekend, it's time to finally change.

I'm gonna throw away whatever weed I have left over and just try to quit cold turkey but there is still a part of my brain telling me that it's okay to keep smoking and that it doesnt have that big of a negative effect on my life.

I'm scared that I won't be able to smoke my problems away. I'm scared that I won't have that outlet anymore. I'm scared that I'll never find my own set of happiness without the weed. I'm scared of the change. I'm scared to come to terms with any pain, any hurt and any negative feelings. I was using weed as a way to numb myself. I fed myself lies, told myself it would ""relax"" me, make me feel better. But did it? It never did...

I know I need to make a lot of changes in my life. The first and biggest one holding me back is smoking. It's going to take a lot of pain and suffering to get through this month. With the recent family stress in my life, I worry that facing the pain is going to spiral me down.....but.I know I need to face these feelings. I can't hide forever. It sure was nice living in a hole, being comfortable in never taking a chance, never taking a risk and just being mundane through life.  I'm disgusted with myself. I used to take pride in being a leader, not a follower. I always wanted to be a role model for others and it starts with taking better care of myself, for myself.

It's time to take my control back. It's time to stop quitting every month and for once, JUST STOP! It's madness to continue this up and down, conflicting myself with all these questions, doubts and counterarguments on if it's good or bad for me. Personally, I will never be able to have a relationship with weed after this. It hurts knowing that but this plant is doing N-O-T-H-I-N-G for my life. It hasn't taken me anywhere, my opportunities just seem to be blocked being in any environment with weed. I am not the same bubbly, cheerful and charming girl. I'm a zombie, just waiting for my next puff. That's not who I want to be. I don't want to be that messy girl with red eyes. Over what? A damn plant? Absolutely stupid if you ask me...wreckless, stupid and irresponsible. I deserve better and I deserve the life I want to live.

I want to be able to look back next year and really feel uncomfortable because they say that's how you know you've been through growth. I can't wait to grow. It won't be easy, It is going to hurt and I need to be okay with the days where I can allow myself to cry, feel those feelings or just lay in bed while I remind myself that it's just the withdrawals. Remind myself, that I can't accomplish real change overnight and that it's a process. Remind myself that I'm doing the best I can and stop beating myself up. I am so hard on myself (high expectations) and I truly need to stop that.  Att the end of the day, I KNOW what I need to do....No more excuses, the time has come.",3,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8141900897026062}"
2020-11-02 02:22:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jmj5rk/learning_from_this_relapse_and_a_list_of_pros_and/,Learning from this relapse and a list of pros and cons of smoking weed,"The relapse was *bad* - I blew through bag after bag, sometimes not even lasting me a day and then immediately bought more, got high at 7AM when I woke up and smoked all day every day, which I spent in bed ordering takeout I can’t afford for every meal instead of being bothered to cook, letting my flat get covered in garbage and dirty dishes, not showering. 

I didn’t even seem to care that I wasn’t alone while I was doing this (like I would normally have made some effort to hide it when it was that bad) because my partner was staying with me for what was meant to be a nice week of spending time together. For the first day or two it was fun and I was able to function, but then I really rapidly spiralled into the absolute worst version of my addictive behaviour, like frighteningly fast. I ruined their birthday and my own birthday, really upset and hurt them because they were trying to tell me something important about their mental health struggles and I was so wasted that I literally just wandered off to go and roll a joint and left the room in the middle of them trying to open up to me and started going on about some unrelated bullshit when I came back because I’d completely forgotten what we were talking about, and didn’t even notice any reaction to that from them at all, didn’t remember it the next day. I have absolutely zero memory of doing this, which scares me a lot. I have a bunch of things I don’t remember from this bender, because my memory is awful when I’m smoking, but apparently I was dismissive and hurtful to my partner a lot of the time and they said my personality was completely different, which is a big trigger for their CPTSD having grown up with an alcoholic abuser. This is the first time they’ve really seen me be this out of control with weed, because we’ve been together a year and I spent the last six months of that in recovery. I love this person, I want to be a safe place for them, I’m usually a good partner and I’m so ashamed that I treated them like that and at the time thought everything was fine. The shame has been really difficult to handle the last couple of days. I’m only just now being able to talk myself round to not thinking I’m a complete and total piece of shit as the shame hangover wears off. 

I also was supposed to be working from home when I was just in bed being a disgusting trash goblin, and I did no work and ended up mixing the days up of a very important commitment and getting an email from my boss at 11am after I’d just woke up like ‘where are you?’ which I’ll have to deal with the fallout of in a couple of hours (haven’t slept all night so I’ll be getting up to log on to work in an hour). 

I missed an important meeting for the mutual aid group I set up during my six months of sobriety, something that I’d wanted to do for years and finally managed to get off the ground, absolutely no way I could have done that without being sober and immediately I don’t believe in myself enough when I’m not. 

I had a stupid argument with my best friend a couple of days ago which really visibly upset him (while sober but feeling weird and angry and emotional and crazy due to early sobriety) that I know for a fact would never have happened if I hadn’t had this relapse. 

I could destroy my life with this. I need my job, I need to maintain my mental health which is impossible to do in active addiction. I’m in a relationship that I want to be in for the rest of my life and I need to do everything in my power to make it work. I need to do things that make me feel proud of myself, and that help people. 

I wanted to share a list I wrote right before I started my first six months sober as a reminder to myself and in case it helps anyone else. I’ll add more to this and post it as a comment, as I’ve learned from this relapse how my behaviour when I’m high can affect people I love, and I now have more big reasons to stay sober than I did before. 


REASONS TO SMOKE

1. i’ll relax
2. i’ll feel more able to be funny (but not necessarily actually be funny)
3. i’ll feel more confident
4. get to be a little selfish, i care for people a lot and it seems like a way to focus on myself (not really doing me a lot of good though) 


REASONS NOT TO SMOKE

1. i am at the point where i’m about to lose my job and i know this is making the situation much worse. i am going in high and calling in sick constantly. if i didn’t lose days and weeks at a time to 20 bags and could keep track of this shit, the patterns would be very very obvious
2. i’m scared of how bad my memory is getting, i have memory problems anyway because of adhd and this is making it much worse
3. have to become a selfish asshole 
4. weed makes me isolate myself
5. i’m fucking broke, going through forced withdrawals at the end of every month, borrowing money i can’t pay back from friends and family to afford to eat til i can buy more weed
6. weed removes my ability to be present, and i can’t remember nice things that happened when i was high afterward  
7. i end up coughing up black and brown gunk into the sink every single day, my lungs rattle when i breathe and i have a hacking cough all the time, COPD from the tobacco is a very very realistic prospect
8. i hate how i live when i’m high all the time, my place is filthy, my clothes are dirty, i can go days without showering because i don’t give a shit, i don’t take care of my cat as well as i should
9. i don’t have money to spend on essential things
10. my care of myself is basically zero, i use weed instead of caring for myself, to heighten the comfort of the few things i do indulge in (basically just cherry coke and crisps) but in the end i stop bothering with that and it’s just water and a spliff, and then it’s just a spliff without even the water, lying in bed all day and rotting like the guy who’s sloth in se7en
11. my dealer literally just sent me a text bragging about the lamborghini he bought, i cannot handle picking up in a lamborghini i helped pay for that is too fucking ridiculous for words",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9996782541275024}"

i’m on day three again after a relapse after i made it six months, which is my longest period of sobriety. i don’t know if anyone else relates to this but i sometimes almost would prefer it if my problem was with alcohol or harder drugs, even though i know that would be worse for me, because i really can’t shake the feeling that it’s not a real drug and not a real addiction, even though i know damn well it’s ruining every aspect of my life - finances, work, physical health, relationships. i will spend all my money on weed and end up with no money for food or basic essentials, will smoke til my lungs rattle, smoked through bronchitis multiple times. have borrowed so much from friends and family without being able to pay them back. i could absolutely get fired over it, i could lose the people i love. when i’m smoking i wake up and immediately get high, i used to go into the office stoned before i started working from home, imagine doing that with booze, there would be zero doubt someone was an alcoholic if they did that, i’m jealous of that certainty and how alcoholism is taken seriously. i absolutely cannot smoke in moderation and i will continue to do it while watching it ruin my life, not caring because i’m numb to everything. it’s not even that people in my life don’t take it seriously because i’m really lucky that mostly they do, and are understanding that this is an addiction, it’s me that feels this way. i’m going to go to my first online Marijuana Anonymous meeting tomorrow because i feel like i need the structure and seriousness of a 12 step program to beat this. the cringe factor of going to a 12 step thing seems doubled when it’s for weed, but i don’t feel like i belong at other recovery meetings because the other people there have issues with the kinds of drugs that can kill you, and some of these people people smoke weed and call that  sober. does anyone else feel this way? i’ve used the logic of it being no big deal because culturally it’s not seen as a big deal so many times as a reason to relapse and to not take my recovery seriously.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974068999290466}"

31 years old, smoked everyday for a decade.

I've tried to get many times in the past, only to relapse around the 48 hour mark. How did I manage to reach day 7 this time? I was truly serious about quitting. The biggest contributing factor is that I threw my bong in the trash, which was my primary means of smoking. I made it 48 hours and my wife gave me a gram. After debating it, I ended up smoking it. With my bong gone, I had to empty out a cigarette and fill it with that gram. I went to my car and smoked it. The high wasn't special at all, in fact, I didn't feel much at all.

Back to day 1 after that. I was a little bummed out, but I now knew that I was truly done. The next 7 days actually went by without much issue. I went out and bought a bunch of caffeine free herbal tea and some micro gram dosage of melatonin. I was able to establish a regular sleep pattern in about 2 days. Come 9 PM, I'm ready for bed. The caffeine free tea really helped me with my anxiety, though its still kind of bad, so I will be reaching out to my doctor about something to help me.

The worst part about this first week was the lack of appetite. I've lost considerable weight. Day 7 though, my appetite is starting to normalize. I still feel pretty lethargic, but it is relatively easy to shrug off.

I've started a 30 minute body weight workout routine, along with yoga and meditation. I've begun repairing all the relationships I've ignored for the past decade, especially with my two children.

The anxiety is difficult to deal with at times, especially with the oddities that I've been experiencing, such as leg pain and limb numbness / tingling. It sends me spiraling down the Google rabbit hole where I'm convinced I have some type of cancer or other nasty disease. I did get blood work done on Friday, so I'm waiting for the results on that. I've made two dentist appointments to finish getting cavities drilled. I'm doing my best to get my body to where it should be. Ignoring my health for the past 10 years, even though I'm skinny, prior blood work showed that I had high cholesterol and close to being pre-diabetic.

Overall, I feel like a better me. I've had 2 instances where cravings hit me. I sat down to watch a new movie on Netflix and instinctively paused it thinking ""I've got to go take a toke real quick"". I fought through it.

Sorry if this has turned into more of a rant. Today was probably the most difficult day out of them all. I just didn't feel well. I hope this post helps someone out there that might be on the fence about quitting.

If there's anything to take from this; you really have to want to quit. Make that conscious decision that now is the time. Throw out all your paraphernalia. Get rid of caffeine and pick up some herbal tea with chamomile and some low dose melatonin. And probably the most difficult one--you just have to keep busy, even if you don't feel like it, don't let that boredom creep up on you. I've decided to get back into pursuing a career in IT, so I installed Linux on a spare SSD I had.

The first week wasn't too bad for me, I was high on not being high and whilst struggling with cravings, nausea, anxiety and insomnia, I actually felt pretty good, had lots of energy and started using melatonin to help me get to sleep and establish a new routine. This 2nd week has been pretty challenging though. I didn't really crave smoking weed in the 2nd week, which was really surprising, but have  been through a roller coaster of emotions, one day feeling positive and energetic, the next very fatigued and often angry. I've been doing my best to manage my emotions and not get angry with those around me but it's been pretty tough to deal with. I had my first psychiatrist appointment last Thursday which was an emotional experience for me, but hopefully over the coming months will help me make progress on myself and work on finding out who I am without the constant crutch of using weed. 

Whilst it's been an interesting ride,  overall all I feel really proud of making it to 2 whole weeks, I seriously doubted whether I could even make it this far when I quit 2 weeks ago and have to keep reminding myself that whilst I've got a long way to go to beat my addiction, I should be proud of what I've achieved so far. 

Thanks for everything so far leavers, your support has been amazing and a constant reminder that we can all do this if we work hard and stay focussed.

Mood swings, irritability, panic attacks and anger at myself is subsiding. Im able to concentrate for long periods of time while studying. Even though I don’t remember everything. I’m enjoying the nature of being clean. A big part about this is accepting the time and brain cells wasted. The opportunities that were lost to a plant. Sober from smoking upwards of 2 grams of concentrate per day. The focus is on staying clean, working out, eating a balanced diet with brain foods, and just surrounding myself with positive energy. I’m just coming out of the rough but I know I got along way to go. Starting this journey while breaking off a year long relationship was not easy either. But the dopamine is starting to flow again. I start nursing school in 5 months hopefully my memory will recover more. I’m working hard tryna study 6/7 hours daily. I am really thankful for this community and look forward to reading as many posts as possible and spreading good energy. Stay up everybody. Everyday the sky gets a little more bluer.

First of all, I want to thank r/leaves in its entirety because, to be blunt (no pun intended lmao, realized this while correcting my post), this subreddit is the reason I finally found the strength to stop weed. Also, this is a throwaway account for privacy reasons and I apologize for that. I'll be answering your (possible) questions when I log on this account a few times a day :)

I will tell my story then give you a few tips i've collected and tried. If you only want the tips, go straight to the bottom but I tried to make my story relatable and, I hope, helpful for you out there still trying to stop.

**STORY**

&#x200B;

I'm 22 and I've been smoking everyday for the last 3 years. I live in Europe so I smoke mainly hash, which means that I am both addicted to THC and Nicotine. I believe it's easier if it's only weed so you have that for you if that's the case !

I have a pretty standard story: started smoking during parties with friends, then starting to smoke alone, then smoking alone all day every day. I guess most of you know the drill. It's like every addiction, when I started everything was fine, I was enjoying being high af all the time chilling, blablabla.

Like a year and a half ago, while I was doing an internship, I started to realize that weed (i'll just use weed as a generic term for this post) started to grow in my life. I was getting home earlier to smoke, I would sacrifice some parties with friends bc that involves driving and in the country I live in, a positive THC test while driving results in losing your driving license, so when I had to choose, i went for smoking rather than driving to see my friends or do stuff. I want to insist on the fact that I was already not happy about this decision. Ultimately I wanted to smoke alone at home but this definitely didn't make me feel better. I know you know this feeling so I don't need to explain it.

&#x200B;

That's the first thing I want to say before I say more about me : You are not the only one feeling the way you feel.

When you're high AF at 3 in the morning with your stomach hurting from stress, thinking about how fucked up you're gonna be in life if you keep going this way, I felt that too. A lot of people on r/leaves feel that. We all believe that our reactions are unique but they're not, it's like the first time you realize that everyone enter back their room after they've cleaned it to make sure it looks tidy. Nobody never talk about it but we all do it.

There's a title of a post here that made me realize that, someone quoted ""I want to be high when i'm sober but I wanna be sober when I'm high."" (thanks to you btw) and at this very moment, I realized I was not alone.

I'm ""lucky"" enough that I was still studying until last year, it went okay but not as I expected so i had something to be disappointed about. If I started smoking after finding an ok job, I would probably never have strived for better, being happy about my job and the fact that I can pay for my hash. For all of you that work and are addicted to weed and believe you could do better : you can do better.

I started 2020 with a new years resolution type of thing, trying to smoke less. The beginning of the year was pretty good and I would smoke a bit less, like I had some days where I didn't have any hash and didn't smoke. I also smoked less during lockdown because I had like 15g for 2 months but when lockdown ended, oh God, when we were allowed to go outside, all hell broke loose. I was smoking all day everyday during the whole summer and in September and October and the most crazy thing is what follows :

&#x200B;

I did not enjoy smoking.

&#x200B;

Yeah I was high and that made me forget that I stopped school and that I didn't know what to do in my life. I played video games all day while smoking and watching twitch streamers, not enjoying myself. I was not enjoying my time because i had that pain in my stomach, a permanent pain in my stomach all day every day from the second I woke up to the minute I went to bed. And even though weed seem to help when you can focus on something like a tv show and you forget about everything, when the thought machine start running you can not stop it. And those thoughts are dark.

&#x200B;

During October, I finally found something that I believe could be my job for the rest of my life and I was pretty happy about that. But instead of working on that, being happy about my day and feeling productive, I kept smoking. It was even worse than before because I was not happy about being addicted, not happy about being too high and lazy (THC = laziness, let's be honest, someone on this sub said ""Weed is a luxury for those that have already made it in their life"" and I cannot stress this enough) to study for my future job and not happy about ""losing"" against my addiction.

&#x200B;

I started to do crazy shit to try and stop smoking. For example, one night high AF I was really, really sad, feeling like I was wasting my life. I took my phone and wrote a long ass note saying stuff like ""*Dude  \[my name\], you can do it, I know that tomorrow morning you're gonna want to roll a joint first thing in the morning, please don't do it, I know you want it but don't do it""* but it didn't work, I wanted to smoke more than anything when I woke up. I had tobacco, hash, paper, there was no reason not to roll and then bam, I would light it, smoke a puff or 2, wait a minute and I would be me again, thinking that weed is trash and that I should stop. This process repeated itself for like 3 weeks, feeling even worse and worse everyday.

One night, probably one of the worst nights, I was stressed as fuck. My stomach was hurting, I was high and I was soooo sad, like true sadness. That night, I finished my last grams of hash and was trying to convince myself not to message my dealer the next morning. This was even harder considering I buy to a few dealers around my area but also on the deep web, which makes it fucking easy and I'm still afraid of that tbh.

Anyway, I was in my bed, stressed as fuck and I started to look up for advices on reddit that could help me and I stumbled upon r/leaves. This might seem cliché but I was lying in my bed, reading top of all time from r/leaves for like 2 hours. Then, I got up, took all my rolling stuff (paper, half a pack of tobacco, shit like that, even my rolling trays lmao), put it in a bag and threw the bag in the trash. I tried to do all of this in one go, without thinking about ""what about if I want to smoke tomorrow ?"" or shit like that, I was just using the motivation r/leaves gave me to act on what I SHOULD do.

&#x200B;

I realize that I talk a lot about myself and believe me, this is not because of my ego. I don't feel pride in sharing these stories. On the contrary tbh. I just want to insist on the fact that this is because I could relate to so many people in r/leaves that I stopped. Not because someone had a magical tip that made everything different (although kinda, i'll explain) but because a huge collection of people knew how I felt, why I felt it and so many many many people explained a simple thing : Everything you feel right now can be gone very quickly. Just. Stop. Smoking. Just do it. You are a capable human being that can control itself and you can do great things in life. Stop smoking, start working. That's as simple as that. (it's not but you know, motivational speech). A quote that I like when I think about that is  ""Don't watch the clock. Do what it does. Keep going"".

&#x200B;

Anyway, after cleaning my smoking stuff, I got on my phone and uninstalled the messaging apps I used for my dealers. Also uninstalled TOR for deep web stuff. I haven't smoked since then and I have to say I feel ok. I even passed what I considered to be the most difficult test : I went to a party with my smoking friends, even rolled a few joints for them and did not smoke. I told them my situation, they didn't offer, I didn't ask, all good. I felt very good about that.

**TIPS**

This is where the tips come and even if only one of you, you reading right now, can stop smoking thanks to my story and the tips, i'd be the happiest man alive.

&#x200B;

**- I used** a technique someone suggested which is to create an evil character in your head. This person is not you, it's an ugly person that makes you want to smoke. Everytime ""you"" want to smoke it's not you, it's them. How do you know that ? Because you're reading a long ass post from a dude who stopped smoking on r/Leaves. You want to stop. The ugly guy doesn't want you to stop. He wants you to pay for your weed every week like an addict and not do stuff and enjoy life only when high. He's a filthy motherfucker. Picture him as evil as you can in your head, even your worst enemy. Everytime he wants to smoke, you're stronger than him. You want to win against him. You want to make this fucking loser so deprived of weed that he'll leave your mind.

Of course the ugly guy is a metaphor for (weed) addiction. This was the biggest advice for me and If I find back the person who shared it, i'll add the link here (feel free to add it in the comments if you remember)

&#x200B;

**- I'm sure** that some of you consider life as ""pointless"" when not smoking. I was like that. Like, there's a very important football match tomorrow or a new TV show that you're waiting for and you just want to smoke while watching it. You believe that it more enjoyable while high or smoking. It's even more than that, you kind of feel like you would not enjoy it as much as you could if you're not smoking. This is BS. This is the ugly guy trying to take control of you. This TV show is good and you'll enjoy it even more sober because you'll understand more, you'll feel more focused and you'll be stress free, not worrying about another day spent high.

&#x200B;

**- Try to** find something to look forward to. I know this is hard. It took me more than a year lmao but you need to do something of your days. Kinda cliché but every second spent is already gone, you can't do anything about the last few years, that's just life. You can do something for the years to come, trust me. I believe that some of you are unemployed and unschooled, just working a bit to pay for your weed and that's it. I know you already know because you feel it but I got to say it again : This is not an enjoyable life. No matter what it is, find something. Anything. Music, studying, learning, looking for jobs, anything, even reading wikipedia articles all day, who cares ? Just do something that makes you want to wake up in the morning. Video games ? Just play dude, don't smoke, that's the only thing. You may believe this is unsufficient : yes it is, playing video games will (probably) not make a living for you but your goal is not to make a living right now, your goal is to focus your mind on enjoying life while sober. That's it. If you stop smoking while doing something you dislike, like a job you hate, the only thing you'll be waiting for is getting home and getting high. If you do not have a choice and have to do a job you don't like to support yourself or your family, please understand that it is very normal for you to be frustrated at the end of the day and to want to smoke it out. Do not smoke it out. Read it out. Play it out. ""Friend"" it out. No matter what. Don't smoke. The problem isn't the answer.

&#x200B;

**- Stop smoking for real.** This is an advice that you may not find useful but it was very important to me. You don't want to bargain with yourself like ""it's ok to smoke during the weekend"" or ""it's only a joint, it's no big deal"". Yes it is. You are literaly on a subreddit intended to help people to stop smoking. You want to stop smoking. So stop, for real. It may be hurtful and difficult but that's what you want so ""Do what the clock does..."" :)

&#x200B;

*That's it.*

&#x200B;

I truly hope this is helpful. This is only day 9 for me and it's like night and day. I'm actually feeling like I a me (I guess i was feeling a bit derealization which made me worried), I remember stuff but tbh, I think about weed a lot. Oh my god I do. Every day I want to smoke. But I try to fight it because there's no way I'm losing to that ugly loser.

Do it for yourself. Please. I feel your pain even though I don't know you. I don't want you to hurt. I want you to have a great life and to do stuff and as I said, even if you, the person reading, is the only one to stop, i'll be really happy.

Thanks for reading

Feel free to ask any questions, I'll try to be as thorough and precise as I can.

Have a good one and you got this !

:)))

I'm now at eleven months! Who whould have thought? Not me thats for sure. 

I wrote here when I had reached 1 weeks explaining how I needed my life back and hoping I whould get to 2 weeks but was very doubtful.
Then I wrote here again when I was at 55 days where I wrote about how happy I was that I quit. 

It's funny you whould think that the start was the hardest and then it'll slowly get easier. 
But when I reached 6 months it started getting especially hard. 
I lost my internship beacuse of corona and was stuck at home. Then my only income was taken away. Nobody was hiring and the only way to keep a roof over my head was to work very hard for nothing at a factory and then try to go back to school (students are paid in my country) and I felt far from felt ready mentally.
Luckily the school decided that I was good enough somehow. 

Shortly after that it was a dead friends birthday, it hit harder that  the last. Probably beacuse she whould have been 18 haven't she killed herself. 

I got though it all. Without as much as a cigarette. 
I Think it was possible beacuse of the people who was involved. I'm so happy I involved people in my struggle getting sober.
It was something I used to be very private about. I wouldn't have gotten though it all if it wasn't because there where people ruting for me. 

So much good has come from this. I have been able to be a part of society again, and I'm creating a future worth something. My dream of working with autistic children are not so far away anymore (I'm autistic myself).
I'm no longer someone that my friends and family worry about. And I'm finally getting somewhere with my treatment (anxiety and depression). I'm using my money on food and my heart is finally beating normally. 

Wednesday i'll be moving into a cosy small rented house with my boyfriend and his very sweet cat. That wouldn't be possible if I still abused hash either. 

But most importanty I am not living my life on pause. Im not running in circles dreading having the the same problems. My life is changing, it's vivid, and I'm there for all of it. I am alive again. 

Thank you for taking your time to read this I hope it helped. Remember not to do this alone. It's much easier to fall back when there is only yourself to disappoint. .",22,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7055534720420837}"

It has always made me anxious but regardless I’ve always used it as a form of escapism. Within the past year and a half I started smoking heavier than ever before. I was dealing with a breakup, loneliness and also just sticking with smoking because I was really trying to convince myself it was good for me (trying so many different strains, ways of consuming to avoid anxiousness but no, my nervous system is just too sensitive)... but at a certain point I had become mentally, even somewhat physically addicted. I couldn’t stop thinking about it when I wasn’t high and then would have spinning thoughts of regret after I would smoke. I was using it as a way to evade feeling harder emotions but the trade off was feeling insecure, confused and irritable. My boyfriend has called me out for being irritable on it but doesn’t want to be the one to tell me what to do and leaves the choice up to me. Recently I went 2 weeks off of it which is the longest I’ve gone in at least a year and I was so proud of myself. Last night on Halloween I was convinced that eating an edible would be “fun” but the same story happened. Irritable, outside of myself, uncomfortable and wish I had just continued to work through my feelings of discomfort while sober. I am extremely sensitive and have big emotions and social anxiety. I gave up alcohol completely 3 months ago and that was easy because the feeling of it being poison is more obvious to me. I’ve known for a while now that the same goes for weed.

2020-11-01 10:32:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jm445u/230_days_clean_questions_and_update/,230 days clean questions and update,"Hi, I was an everyday, every hour smoker for about 2 and a half years (which isn’t that long I guess but given I was 14 when I started)
I will be 18 in a month, and quitting was the best thing I’ve done.
I spent thousands on weed, I had a job solely to feed my addiction, and I was high so much I had trouble functioning sober. I even dropped out of highschool.
Eventually i got laced with K2, and as much as it scared me and messed me up (I felt like my heart was going to blow up, my eyes felt like they were melting, and the visual snow was so intense, plus the burning inside), it was one of the best things that happened.
After getting laced I couldn’t smoke even normal weed anymore, I’d been wanting stop but had a lot of trouble quitting, it was like every time I tried quitting something in me would impulsively go “well one little hit won’t hurt while I work it out my system” and that would turn into more, and more.
I wasn’t using weed for just a fun high, I was using it to numb everything, and to deal with my “ADHD and depression” because it helped it.
At least that’s the excuse I’d use, in reality it was making all my mental health issues far worse, and I was blinded by the fact I wanted weed to be my savior so badly.
In these days I’ve been clean, I’ve learned more and grown more as a person than I have in years.
I’ve been able to learn new skills, pick up new hobbies, and despite covid I’m more social(online at least) and less isolated than ever.
My ADHD is still really bad, so I’m trying to get meds from a psychiatrist to help me focus, I have trouble with focusing on learning certain things even if I enjoy them. Or focusing on anything really. I hyperfocus so I lose track of time and forget to eat or drink at times. But even with this I’m still doing way better than I was with weed in my system which just exacerbated these symptoms.
My depression is no longer constant like it was, it comes in waves usually around my period (PMS). 
The only major system I had from quitting was major health anxiety, insomnia, and depression the first few months were hell, I constantly felt like I was dying and thought everything was wrong with me.
I could heart and feel my heart beat constantly, and would struggle with depersonalizations.
I still occasionally will have anxiety, but nothing compared to the start of when I quit, when I had constant panic attacks.
I still sometimes leave my body like watching a simulation, but mostly when I get anxious and I know how to deal with it. (For me doing physical activity, art, talking to someone/physical contact with another animal(cats/dogs/etc) or human helps most).
One symptom I’ve had is tinnitus and visual snow, those haven’t gone away too much but they’re not that annoying and I’m sure they’ll heal in time.
The tinnitus can be irritating but it kinda goes in and out.
As for the visual snow it’s pretty consistent but only when I look at plain color surfaces or my popcorn ceilings.

Since quitting I haven’t lost any weight, however that’s because a lot of my body fat has been replaced with muscle, though even when heavy smoking I’ve always been on the thinner side. (I have IBS so I have trouble eating a lot of things and often struggle with appetite at all with the ADHD.)
I’ve been working out a lot more (on and off as I do lose focus, but enough to see and feel a difference), 
With covid I’m unable to go back to my sport (jiu-jitsu/judo and I was going to start Muay Thai) but I’ve been doing a lot of hiking, mountain biking, some running, and wrestling with my brother and dad.
I’ve been doing more gaming on my pc and dungeons and dragons than I should be lately, and I should honestly be doing more meditation and stretches/yoga/reading, I’ve just kinda had a short loss of motivation the past two weeks.
Let me tell you when I was consistently doing stretches and reading, meditation, art, and all the physical activities I felt amazing! 
I’m not gonna beat up on myself too much for having a couple lazy weeks though, even with all the improvements I’ve made we’re only human and flawed. It’s about recognizing the changes and mistakes within ourselves and growing from it.

Another thing to add, during this period I had slipped up and smoked maybe 1-3 times with a friend.
But those were more experimental and I found I was greeted with insomnia and anxiety after, so I just decided to give weed a break. I hope not forever as I would love to causally smoke like once and a while on a weekend with friends again, but if not I’m at peace with it. I don’t need it to be content.

At this point I don't even know if it's withdrawal. People keep saying it's going to be ok, it's going to get better, but it doesn't feel like it. I thought since I wasn't smoking for that long maybe my withdrawal wouldn't be as bad as others who smoked for years on end, maybe two weeks isn't that long but symptoms aren't feeling that much better. I am getting slightly better sleep I went from waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to go back to sleep, to not being able to go to sleep in the fist place, and now I wake up everyday around 3am and fall asleep until the sun comes up and it barely feels like I even slept. I don't feel rested. On top of that my stomach has only gotten worse as the weeks have gone by, no appetite, feeling full fast, stomach discomfort, diarrhea (which has been really worrying me). Oh yeah and I have barely any will to do anything, I've fallen behind on schoolwork and I have no will to do work. I didn't even feel like playing videogames for a while, although now I kind of do with friends (which honestly isn't helping much). I don't know what's wrong with me, I guess things will get better but I'm in this rut. I have friends around to help me feel better, which I think is keeping me from going insane, but I just don't know what to do anymore.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977532029151917}"

(30-m)Days tracked are getting lost as I continue this journey! Boy it is nice not to be calling the dealer every time you are running low or out in a panic for more and is nice to be able to see some $ in the wallet that would be rolled in a swisher. I do miss the physical act of smoking but only because I enjoyed the motion( used to smoke cigs for years) and quit 3 and a half years ago. These posts have really helped along with drinking lots of water and knowing that what I am feeling is temporary as I smoked for so long and daily use. 1.5-2 grams a day. Just thought I would share that if you have anxiety and think that it’s helping as I did, it’s really making it worse( imo) I used to always say it helps my anxiety and makes me more outgoing but in reality it holds you back and keeps you numb ( again imo) stay strong and keep trying to grow that number and instead searching fir what you are missing, look forward to what you can be experiencing and go do it! Take that run, do the push ups, put the work in, we are in this together. 1 task at a time.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9722812175750732}"

Hello everyone, 

Hope you are all staying strong and those of you who are going trough PAWS hell like I do, I feel for you...

Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jch6hf/paws_or_have_i_lost_my_mind_panic_attacks_after_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) to my previous detailed post I made on day 64, if someone wants to read it. In short, I was desperate back then and felt like I'm losing it. I'm on day 80 now and doing a little better.

From your guys stories, it seems like usually everyone who gets really bad PAWS talks about the first 3 months being hell, then still getting waves after that, but a lot more manageable and is able to function. 

When I quit, initially I was OK, but around day 30ish clean, PAWS suddenly hit me full force with massive panic attack, which sent me to the ER. 

Since then I had only few good days. Symptoms have been coming in waves as everyone describes. It feels like my body is literally going trough a list of every symptom and every few days checks some off and is done with them. A few persist though and come and go.

After the first wave of paws, which lasted around 10 days, I felt it's getting better and that I'm out of it. I was wrong. Was still getting waves of new symptoms on a off, but it was manageable. 

**It was only recently (around day 60) that it went all downhill again.** I was hit with massive brain fog and/or DPDR which was accompanied by anxiety and panic attacks again. Felt awfull awfull...Also some new symptoms appeared, but I think 90% of everything stems from anxiety (and health anxiety). **This time (day 60ish-72ish) the anxiety/panic attacks almost felt worse than during the initial wave (day 30ish).** So the withdrawal really is non-linear.

For the last week, the anxiety has been subsiding and last couple of days I have felt pretty good after a long time. 

Right now I have probably the longest streak of good days since the paws started and feel like the worst just finally might be over. I want to believe this...

My current symptoms are:
* brain fog
* mild DP/DR
* feeling a little high

I think these 3 are closely related and it's hard to even tell the difference between them.

I'm expecting more waves of symptoms to come, but I want to believe they won't be as severe and I will be able to function again even with them.

I have a dillema right now because I should be moving to another country, to a new job in 9 days. I already got a flight ticket and everything (I could cancel it though and lose the job opportunity). I want to get back into real life and function (right now unemployed and home all the time since we have a lockdown). I would be safer to overcome this withdrawal/PAWS here in my comfort zone, but at the same time, I wanted to get out of here for so long and finally have an opportunity. I don't know though if it's wise to make a big change and decision like this right now, since I was an anxious wreck just 10-14 days ago and this could create a lot of new stress/anxiety. 

I feel like I can't plan anything long-term and this big if there's a chance I'll be hit with next waves and anxiety so massive that I'm scared to even leave the bed...

My family all agreed on the opinion and gave me advice that no way I should go there now in this condition...

But if it's weed withdrawal, it should be getting better and better, not worse and worse, right?

**What would you do in my situation?**
New enviroment, work, people etc would be really good for a quitting addict, but could be really stressful and counter-productive for a PAWS-induced anxiety/panic wreck, which I fear I might once more become if PAWS waves hit hard... 

**What was your guys timelines of symptoms?**
**When did PAWS peaked for you?**

Seems unlikely to me that the worst is still waiting for me, but that's what I thought after the initial PAWS wave and I was very wrong. So I would like to hear your guys insights. 

**I want to know if it's possible/likely that the worst symptoms might yet still come...**

**TL;DR:** *Quit and had no symptoms till day 30ish when PAWS hit full force. Overcome the first wave which lasted like 10 days and felt like I'm out of it. Was very wrong. Had some manageable symptoms/waves on and off, until around day 60, when second big wave hit almost worse than the first one. Currently on day 80 and had a pretty good last week. Have a big decision before me, if I should move to another country and take a job I was hired for or cancel it, lose this opportunity and overcome PAWS here in the safety of my “comfort zone”, until I really feel good and normal for a lot longer than a week...I want to know if it's possible/likely that the worst withdrawal/PAWS waves are still waiting for me.*",2,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9931249618530273}"

So much pain. So many mood swings. And I only lasted 45 days before starting to smoke again.

Then a whole year of blaming /forgiving myself. Stopping for a few days, smoking for a few days. The goal of stopping was crystal clear on my mind, but I was too weak to achieve it... Although I never ever went as low as before. 

I wasn't super proud of myself, but I made huge progress in terms of mental health. I understood my relation with the drug better. What were my triggers. Why at some point weed was actually a good crutch for me...

Then a big health issue. I needed a crutch again. I guess you could say that I failed again. But as Beckett says : ""fail again, fail better"". 

I viewed weed as something toxic and to get rid out of as soon as possible. I was just gentle enough with myself to see I had already too much on my plate. 
My hatred for the drug turned mostly into cautious indifference. Neither hatred nor adoration.

It became so easy to stop that... It made me fall into the trap again a few times... Thankfully I realized I was feeling better, I was being TOO gentle with myself this time. That I didn't need a crutch at all, and I remembered all the marvelous things I was missing out on because of weed. Because I had been through many patches of sobriety.

So I stopped again. And looking back, when I compare with the amount of pain and difficulty the first time, it was so easy. I barely felt any withdrawal... I was also making my way back to reality, and a normal social life, so much quicker.

So yes, just a word of encouragement for those who are right now at the same point I was at years ago - quoting bojack's running baboon: ""it does gets easier"". 

And even if you fail for a day, a week, or a month, the most important thing is that you stopped. Looked your problematic relationship with Mary Jeanne in the eyes. Appreciated sobriety. Found out that not having this Xth joint of the day didn't kill you. That the night sweats stopped. That the dreams were coming back,... That's some insane motivation for you right there.

So, guaranteed, it does get easier.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9876757860183716}"

Ran out yesterday and all my locals are dry so have to go through the cold Turkey but I've been trying to do this for so long now.

I have the anxiety.

I'm not a fan but I don't want to buckle.

Everything seems to be an effort and time is moving so so slowly. 

Why can't I just have the one joint...why do I have to be the one to have another and then another chasing a feeling that I had only once when I first toked! 

I should know better.

This is my declaration to do better. To be myself and to not rely on drugs. 

Ive been lucky in that I have survived this so far and I have a brilliant job and a wonderful wife.
