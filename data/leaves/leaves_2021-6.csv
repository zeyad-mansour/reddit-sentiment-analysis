Infact it’s all those other failed attempts that are actually making it easier this time around because I know that feeling of giving in and having that shitty regret feeling hanging around , relapsing can be a never ending spiral if your mindset on stopping isn’t in the right space ..

Anyways I’m just leaving this post because I know for a lot of people struggling reading stuff like this helps a lot , I know all too well .. 

So the first week or so the only struggles I really had was not being able to sleep good and the on and off mood swings .. which basically continued into week 2 but started to die down abit ..

Week 3 things improved quite a lot I was sleeping good and my mood swings were a lot better and manageable 

Week 4 my concentration at work and during social situations was definitely better , iv always been very anxious in social situations always going on my phone to act like I’m busy rather than just standing there going crazy in my own head lol I’m sure some of you can relate. 

Weeks 5 + 6 honestly it wasn’t really until this point where I really knew things were changing .. yeah you notice benefits after a couple weeks but they can be very subtle .. 

Back when I was smoking I always use to over think situations or make up own problems in my head during the day at work like my mind could never just chill like there always had to be something creating drama in my head even if it was nothing major it use to drive me insane .. now I can actually work and be focused and in a good mood without all that annoying daily anxiety … and it feels good .

So in conclusion I still feel like 6 weeks is early days but I notice improvement every week that goes by I was a daily smoker for a good 7 years .. I believe a lot of people have to go atleast a good couple months to really come out of that dark place we are all trying to leave .. also eating healthy , exercising has helped a lot so far ..

I've been a daily smoker for most recently the past 3 years. Prior to that, I was pretty frequent for 5-6 years too, just not in a legal state at the time, which has now changed. My flower vape's charging cable finally shit the bed today and all my batteries are drained completely. It's very easy for me to walk down the street, buy a charger and get right back to where I was, but I know that will just feed the demon further and further. 

Just going to chalk this up as Day 1. I need to go cold-turkey, or else it'll still haunt and tempt me. It's ripped me of my personality, made me less interesting, and I am becoming way more aware of the stresses and anxieties that cause me to run to cannabis for comfort, and it's just a band-aid without confronting it. I am about to turn 30 and if they say the 30's are the new 20's, I don't want cannabis to steal the next 10 years from me, as easy as it is to pick it back up. 

I want to have a better relationship with my family members, have those giddy feelings that I get without feeling high, I want to find a nice girl and start a family one day, I want to be successful in what I do, and I don't want cannabis to affect it further than it already has done. There are other factors that play into these issues, but all signs point to cannabis for me as a crutch. 

My best friend just found out she's pregnant and was a daily smoker with me as well, so having a support system there will be incredibly beneficial to us both, including drinking (not as huge a problem as cannabis). I'm pretty sure I'm ready, and I hope I don't come crawling back, but this place is incredibly supportive from what I've read and only encouraged me further to create this post. Not expecting sympathy or anything, but wanted to get it off my chest and say, ""I know I can do this"" because I've seen you all be successful too. As someone said in an earlier post, ""time to light some new sparks"" in life.

I thought I’d share a little about my addiction in case someone on here is struggling the same way I am.

Got out of the Army in 2014 on a medical discharge after being sure that I was going to be a career military guy; went through a divorce around the same time (we were together for 5 years). I went home with no idea what I was gonna do with my life; no friends, no significant other, no sense of direction. I was dealing with chronic depression and slight PTSD, on top of ADHD that i’ve dealt with my whole life. The ADHD would cause my negative thoughts to spiral until I was in such a deep depression that it would almost immobilize me. 

So, I started smoking. At first it was a way for me to cope without drinking (after losing 3 of my friends the next summer, I started heavily drinking by myself). And it did help in the beginning, allowed me to be productive, get back into the gym, keep my job. But then fast forward 6 years, it’s been a hidden crutch. All of my mental shit was still there, just shoved down deep, masked heavily by all the smoking. It got to a point where smoking would just make me feel normal, and not actually get me high, so i started experiencing all that mental shit again that i had been ignoring. Strong thoughts of suicide. 

I had always pride myself in being physically strong and mentally tough, so being addicted to a substance makes me feel like a hypocrite. I started to feel like I wasn’t even myself anymore. I can push hard as fuck when it comes to anything, except quitting. I even gave up going back into the army because i couldn’t stop smoking.

It was all VERY hard in the beginning and I quit cold turkey. The most noticeable symptom has been anxiety and dysphoria. If you were to ask what I am anxious about I would tell you: ""Everything and nothing at all"". It just feels like there are little sparks going off in my brain now and then that set off my fight-or-flight response. It can be very jarring and often pretty scary, but I try to remind myself that the feelings will pass, just like laughing at something funny or crying at something sad. No matter what the emotion, it will wash over us and go back out to sea. That often helps when this feels permanent. 

I still have a hard time with my appetite and I've found that eating snacks or small meals has been my saving grace. Caffeine also made my anxiety worse, so I switched over to black tea. That has helped somewhat. And, I discovered I actually like tea! Bonus!

I have also had a therapist for the last two years and he has been very helpful during this process. I can't recommend talk therapy enough--it has really helped keep me out of the darkest places and helped me to understand that the things I am feeling now are because I have been numbing my emotions with marijuana for a long time. This is a process that takes time (often time that other people believe we don't deserve). It is like a wound that needs to close and sometimes wounds take a long time to heal, especially if they are deep.

For those of you new or unfamiliar with my journey, I quit a little over 6 months ago because I became so anxious that I couldn't drive my car one block down the road to the grocery store. 

My anxiety was mostly limited to driving, and didn't experience INTENSE anxiety until about 2 weeks after quitting. It's at this point where I see a lot of you asking, ""will this ever get better?  Is it worth it to keep going when I only had 'mild' anxiety symptoms before?"" And I'm here to put some of those thoughts at ease.

1. Will this ever get better?

Yes, but it will take some time. For me I was the most anxious from the 2 week mark to about the 4 week mark. I wouldn't say I was fully over it until I hit 2 months, but it had tapered off a bit at least by 4 weeks. 

I'm not going to lie to you it absolutely sucks and it's scary to go through but that's the reality of our situation. You won't die and you'll only improve from here. My #1 tip for you is to make a little anxiety journal during this time. Outline any and all symptoms you have, day by day. When I have temptations to use again I go back and read my anxiety journal during that period and realize a bowl will never be worth a full night of panic and misery again.

To give some concrete proof of my timeline, for the 3 months prior to quitting my resting heart rate was at a flat 65bpm. One month sober and it was at 70bpm. Two months sober I was at 73bpm. Three months sober I was down to 62bpm. Today at 6 months I'm down to 58bpm, the lowest I've been since I started wearing a smart watch 2 years ago and it keeps lowering every month.

2. Is it worth it to keep going when I've only had 'mild' anxiety symptoms before?

Think back to a time before you smoked. Were you ever as anxious as you are now? For me it crept in slowly until it was all I knew. It started with presentation anxiety, moved on to not wanting to drive across bridges or through tunnels, then to highways, and finally driving at all.

Sure I could go back and start again to end the immediate anxiety, but the base anxiety will always continue to escalate the longer you use. Stopping now will curb that and, although hard right in this moment, WILL peak and dissipate over time. You can and will get back to who you were before.

Anyway, I could ramble forever but I just want y'all to know I'm right here with you and we can all get through this together! Cheers to another sober day everyone ✌️",31,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49335417}"

He wasn’t the kind of person who had a drink, he was a weed guy. I decided I would break edge and smoke a huge preroll. I didn’t really expect to enjoy it, it just felt like the right way to respond. I don’t regret it. 

But predictably, I didn’t enjoy myself. Waves of paranoia; the thoughts were so bad it was almost funny. I was like: oh shit, 5G is real, I got microchipped, every conspiracy theory is right, I am being secretly drugged, no one is looking out for my best interests, I need to throw my mind controlling phone device into a river (actually not entirely against that particular thought, but maybe it’s a bit extreme). 

That said, I did crack the shell of my sobriety so-to-speak, and was curious if it was bad weed for me, or if it never was never quite as enjoyable as I had convinced myself, and I was just adjusted to coping with the paranoia and negative thoughts, and now after six months I have actually hit a new plateau where the mindset weed puts me into is genuinely unappealing.

It was the latter. I smoked twice more, two different strains, one from a dispensary, and one organic from a friends backyard. Not as much. The headspace both it put me into is not where I want to be. 

I think I certainly had some good experiences that lured me into thinking grass was a cure-all. Whether or not that was ever true is irrelevant: it isn’t the case anymore. If you’ve been feeling similarly, I would posit that weed just isn’t a good place to invest your sense of well-being. 

I’m gonna stay weed-free. I like the way I feel more without it. I don’t regret the lapse.  I feel galvanized and more confident in my decision, and less like this is a process of exerting self-discipline. I hope you all are able to keep choosing what makes you feel like the best version of you.

I grew up in a beach community where it was widely accepted and both parents smoked it as well. I started experimenting with it when I was very young and by 15 I was smoking everyday. I joined the military after trying college for a year. I stopped cold turkey 11 days before bootcamp and didn’t touch it again for at almost two years after I came back from a deployment overseas. After that it was downhill I ended up getting separated from the military for drug abuse, missing out on the GI Bill and lots of other benefits. I stopped again after being separted but just converted to spice so I could still pass drug tests for the good job I had. After I ended up losing that job( not related to drugs or alcohol) I moved back to my hometown and started smoking bud again. Less than a year later my father died from lung cancer and he wasn’t a cigarette smoker. My father was pretty successful in life, he owned his own financial planning company and was very loved in our community. Before he was hooked up to a ventilator and could no longer speak to me he said something to me that resonated deeply. He said “son you need to smoking pot” I said but you’ve smoked it your whole life and he said for “all the success I’ve had in life I would’ve been way more successful and happier had I not smoked”. I was 25 then and I’m 33 now. I’ve battled constantly since then to quit this plant. I stopped 6 years ago for 9 months and it was the happiest most content time of my life but yet once again I fell down the rabbit hole and completely ruined the relationship I was in with the perfect woman I was madly in love with. She’s now engaged and getting married to another man this summer. She said something to me before we went our separate way that has stuck since “she said why not try to be the best possible version of yourself that you can possibly be” and I know what she meant. When I was sober and off pot I was charismatic, funny and positive. When using I’m negative, dry, unsociable and mean towards people for no reason sometimes especially the ones I truly love the most. That saying about addicts treating the ones that are killing them nicely and being the worse to the ones that love them the most is completely true. Finally after putting myself through all this I’m deciding to leave this plant behind for good.

For all your friends and family that doubt weed is bad are just ignorant unless you have cancer and can’t eat, have turrets, or ms I don’t think there’s any good reason why one should partake in using weed. Looking back weed was a crutch to runaway from my family problems at home, responsibilities at school and at work, running away from feeling pain, feeling loss. It’s makes you numb to feeling and that will hurt your further down the road rather than facing those challenges and your demons head on.

I’ve been clean for 26 months and live is going well.  Rarely do I think about getting high and I’ve come a long way from where I was.  
But last week was really difficult.   My wife had a business trip to Hollywood and I went along with the intention of working remotely and doing some touring around.  However the neighborhood of Hollywood we were staying in was a dump and people everywhere were smoking weed. You couldn't walk a block without getting hit in the face with smoke. 
I white knuckled my way through the area and walked to the bus, we didn’t rent a car.  I thought I was fine because I didn’t have any temptation except for a few fleeting thoughts.  Mostly I was just annoyed and focused on getting away from it. 
What I didn’t realize at the time was that all of last week I had to be super hyper vigilant and in total fight flight freeze mode to survive.  It's miraculous I was able to get any work done at all. I've been home since Sunday night even now I'm emotional, with tears are streaming down my face.  While I’m grateful that this is my response and not relapse, it’s still very difficult. I'm angry and distracted and fatigued but mostly I feel unsafe.  Even back at home is hard to shake these feelings.  The stress and fear is real and I just want to feel ok again.

I have been struggling with weed for quite some time now. The first time I ever sparked up was back in high school. I was mad antisocial and smoking weed would give me that illusion of opening up to others and being a more talkative person. The truth is, the only thing that weed did was feed me lies about the benefits I was gaining. In fact, I was doing the exact same shit. 

shortly after, i slipped back into my antisocial ways. I LOVED smoking by myself. When COVID hit my weed addiction exponentially increased. I would smoke at least twice a day and sit in my room and play video games all day. Weed made me okay with doing NOTHING by myself instead of working to better myself. Every time something bothered me I would question myself.. ""should I get high rn?"" like it was some sort of miracle drug that would solve my problems instantly.

I even defended my disgusting addiction by saying that I am doing well in school and I use it for studying, but if you asked me about any of the notes I took high, I could not tell u a god damn thing. Recently, I have gained a deeper hatred for weed. I feel stupid, unmotivated, unproductive, and above all, anti social. The one thing that I THOUGHT weed would help me fix actually made it worse. 

Instead of being more active in social settings, there are times where I will not even speak because I am too lost in my own thoughts or the social anxiety begins to kick me in the ass and I'm too afraid to speak up.

I don’t know why it annoyed me? I know that’s not what’s going on as I’ve had issues on and off since I was a teen but yeah, it made me feel weird. Either way, he planted the seed and now I’m wondering/curious to know if any other former edible users have dealt with CHS? How has it manifested for y’all?

I would really appreciate it if someone goes through it, but it's fine if you just don't...

I created a post the other day on Reddit, saying that [I have absolutely no withdrawals](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/o8wgsa/72hours_weed_free_absolutely_no_widrawl_or_side/). I received some replies saying that I'm on a pink cloud. I have never heard the term before, however, I don't think I hit that point.

I could sleep on all 5 days (3-4 h/night), no night sweats, no dreams(I think, I can't recall anything... and I don't remember dreaming in ages..)

Also, people were saying that maybe I wasn't truly addicted.. I'm not sure how you would not make me an addict by smoking 2-3 grams/day, waking and baking, drinking, and smoking all day long.

If it ever happened not to be able to get weed(yes, I live in a country where it's not legal) it would drive me nuts, sweat non-stop, be angry non-stop... and so on.

I was thinking every now and then about smoking, I could feel that my anger level goes a bit higher than usual, I'm a bit more cranky, and so on..  


**I'd like to share how it went so far, and how I'm feeling right now.**

Last night I really considered going and buying. Today too. (luckily, my credit card is locked in my car, and the key... is currently walking around the city.. without me... ergo I don't have any money on me, no credit card, and no possibility of getting money) 

&#x200B;

let's go back a bit further. I smoked on Thursday a couple of joints (kinda low-grade weed) and felt really good. Then, I left the country. I went to a country where you could get weed fairly easily, however, I was not alone. and I could not smoke. I could only drink.

I had to drive for a while(about 15 hours) and I was busy. then tired. then drunk. then busy again. never alone. therefore I could not smoke even if I wanted to, or even if I had some. 

and the first 4 days were ok. I handled it pretty easily. at the end of day 4, I started arguing with so, and we stopped talking. then, it started to get to me. and still does. 

right now, even that I don't have the possibility to buy or nobody to argue with I feel really edgy. I think that the biggest problem with smoking weed(or not smoking) is time management.

I've only slept 3-4 hours/night since Thursday. the truth is I am tired. but I feel like I do have lots of energy and absolutely nothing to do. and all I can do is think. and try not to make bad decisions.   
they say that weed is not addictive. I'm a person who in the past 5 years spent more than could afford, went through depts and so on... just to have some weed.   
I think this situation, where I am now, and I'm forced not to smoke(or buy, cuz if I could buy, I would definitely smoke).

Maybe, I'm thinking that I could leave and go into rehab. where people are trained to deal with angry people who can't manage themselves. BUT. since I got through the first 5 days... without, and I didn't die, I could sleep/eat/function...

I know for sure that I'm better off. I know that. However. if would smoke it would calm me right down. and it would make most of my feelings go away.   
I find it difficult to deal with emotions in this state. And I can't avoid that...

I'm not sure how the rest of the days are gonna be, right now I'm on day 5, and I haven't smoked. I will try and do my best to keep staying off. I know it's for me, I know that smoking (at least the way I was smoking - wake and bake, then continue for the rest of the day until sleep time) is not good for me.   
I don't know how to manage something, and sometimes I abuse this stuff. 

I really want NOT to smoke ever, from now on, be sober and learn how to deal with everything...

Also, let's not count the money that were basically thrown away, relationships ruined because of my choices... I can't seem to find 1 good argument to continue smoking besides the fact that it would make me feel better, and would allow me to hide things under the carpet... that's the only benefit that I can see right now. me, me, me. nobody around me. it doesn't do anything good for me...

however, not having, makes me argue, it makes me angry, it makes me have less patience.. somehow it makes me a way worse person...

Is this the time we seperate for good or will I stay in your comforting but toxic grasp?

About 7 years ago I got introduced to you and I gotta say it wasn't love at first sight. The more I got in contact with you, the more I was looking forward to seeing you in the future. The main reason for this was that I love spending time with people, and because of Mary Jane I got so many chances to hang out and bond with amazing people. Over the years you've cost me a alot of money, damaged my lungs and made sure I didn't do the things that I know are good for me. Yes you've delivered me so many great moments and I spend so much time around amazing people because of you, but the way you take control over my brain is just not okay.

 Don't get me wrong, being high can be a good feeling but once you reach the point where I only wanne smoke to smoke and not even smoke to get high anymore, that's a sign of it being toxic. And than the question remains do I wanne be in your toxic grasp where you decide when I want to smoke? I don't think so...

Saying this isn't easy because you've brought me alot of joy but right now I know you bring way more harm than good and this isn't a relationship I want to continue. And just to clarivy I am not blaming you for anything, nor am I blaming myself. This relationship was just not ment to be.

I wanted to quit for sure since it wasn’t making me high anymore and I had no money. I was sober from December 6 to like early April. I had started to abuse weed because I had gotten r🌸ped and it was very hard on me. During that time I was also introduced to a bad ‘friend’ group.  Point is I was super depressed and I used weed to numb my feelings. I was high every moment of the day I could be. I would wake up and get high and after  I was done, I would get high and I would just repeat the process every day for 2 1/2 years. It was horrible/: I can tell you now that I have healed from it. I am no longer depressed anymore and it doesn’t affect me on my daily life. Which is why is let me be sober. In early April I decided to take a brownie because i wanted to try them for the first time and I handled it well. I started to eat edibles twice a week and that was it. Until I started to buy bud. I now smoke EVERYDAY, once i  the morning (sometimes) but always at night. I enjoy being sober except for the fact that I can’t eat for shit. But Im genuinely happy(: Weed makes me over think tho but I enjoy the other pleasant feelings. I don’t know what to do though. When I abused weed I had all As and just now when I started to consume weed again, I ended school with all As. I’m super productive but it affects me  in my memory but I don’t know how to stop.

I’ve been daily smoking for eight months, but the last three were brutal. As a junior in high school, I had many responsibilities this year, such as finishing my Eagle Scout Rank, maintaining my grades, and a whole other host of pandemic related problems and regular teenage stresses. As my stress this year got worse, I went from a couple cart hits every night to almost a cart a day by April. I went on like this, extremely depressed with the amount of weed I was consuming. I realized that I had a problem, but was too dependent on weed to do it alone. Three days from me writing this, my father borrowed my car and found my entire stash. I confessed to my family when they questioned the stash that I had been addicted for months, and need help to find my way out of this hole. Three days ago I put it all on the table, and asked my family for support. I am now three days clean from weed, and I already feel better than when I would repeatedly rip a cartridge all day, masking the pain and problems I need to address sober. The first three days are historically tough, and the people with similar stories here have helped me get by. To anyone my age, if you don’t think you can handle recovery alone, tell your family or somebody you trust. Getting through this with support is easier than alone. I realized that I wasn’t a “chill stoner,” and I actually was using weed to cope with multiple stressors in my life. I hope people can relate to this, and hope somebody gains the confidence to tell another about their problem.

To say this year has been difficult would be an understatement. My Mom passed suddenly in February. My wife and I are divorcing after 6 years together and (in a twist of irony) our 5th wedding anniversary is in July. Mix in some COVID lock-downs, ridiculous US political shenanigans, and changing societal conditions and you have a recipe for disaster – or, in my case, relapse. 

There’s a moment in the TV Show ‘LOST’ where one of the characters, John Locke, gets shot and is lying in the bottom of a ditch. Things don’t look good for him. His former paralysis (cured miraculously on the island) is back – he can’t move his legs. He is bleeding out from his gunshot wound. He is close to the end and begins to contemplate suicide, grabbing a nearby pistol and pointing it at his head. Suddenly, another character named Walt seemingly appears before him:

Walt: Don’t, John. Put the gun down. 

John (perplexed): …Walt? 

Walt: Now, get up John. 

John: He shot me, and I can’t move my legs. 

Walt: You can move your legs. Now get out of the ditch, John. 

John: Why?!

Walt: Because…you have work to do. 

John: \[smiling\] 

This scene has always been an inspiration to me, and reflecting on my relapse this weekend, it’s no exception. I have the odds stacked against me. Emotional blows from all over the place. Things don’t look good and there are many reasons to quit trying. 

But I have my own Walt telling me to not fall harder into the relapse by saying, “Don’t. Put the equipment down…get up.” I first try and make excuses. “I had a hard week. I had a hard month. I had a hard year. I can’t stay sober”. My own Walt tells me, “You can stay sober. Now get out of the relapse.” With exasperation in my voice I ask, “WHY?!” My own Walt calmly tells me, “Because…you have work to do”. 

I have work to do. I have a life I need to rebuild. I have a son that needs me. I have a Team that is counting on me. I have more emotional baggage with carry-on that I have to process and check in. There's work to do. And it's going to suck. ""If it doesn't suck, we don't do it."" So I better get to work to continue the fight. 

I have sobriety to thank for coming this far and I’m not going to throw it away over a temporary setback. I’ll make sure I am truthful, transparent, and ready to get back after it. 

I have 230 days sober today. Well, take that and subtract 3. 227 days I managed to stay sober, I smoked three times in the last two weeks – ending my streak, but not ending my commitment to change. 

I’m *four years* clean from nicotine today. Well, take that and add in a handful of cigarettes. I smoked a few times in the last two weeks – ending my streak, but not ending my commitment to change. 

I can choose to stay in this dark, lonely, and awful place. I can start to lie to myself (again) that I can smoke occasionally, it’ll be fine, I’m doing awesome, I don’t need help, why did I even think I had a problem in the first place? 

Using the ‘play the tape forward’ method - I know how this story ends. Weather that’s today, next week, next month, next year, or in five years I do know this: nothing good comes of this. I am not the best version of myself when I’m smoking in any way. I use it as a comfort technique and crutch when I am emotionally raw and vulnerable. I use it to escape challenges and pretend like I’m overcoming them by doing none of the hard work. 

I won’t let this setback reset the count. I’m keeping the count for both weed and cigarettes right where they belong. At 230 days, I’ve only smoked weed three times. At four years, I’ve only had a handful of cigarettes. Those are accomplishments I wouldn’t have dreamed of when I first got sober. Now I get to continue the story and demonstrate that my strong character traits include **resiliency** – the ability to bounce back after setbacks and **drive** – the relentless need to improve. 

Sobriety’s progress isn’t binary. It’s true – you’re either sober or you aren’t. But the time you put in to stay sober doesn’t magically vanish. My progress, accomplishments, and hard work don’t just disappear in a puff of smoke. I could certainly allow that to happen. That can’t happen. 

I am still here. I am still breathing. I am still fighting. And I will continue to fight. I will re-calibrate, reload, recharge, and go back out on the attack.",9,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7076635}"

Besides, does the unknown world outside of this prison really offer anything better? There's no guarantees that it'd be better than this--and you'd likely have to do work before things would stabilize and work out for you

Staying in prison is what you're used to, at least this is familiar and you know what is going to happen, and so it's easy to stay here, because everything is mostly ok

But yet, you feel slightly uncomfortable and sometimes you get angry at yourself for wanting to stay. Another thought in you says it could be a good idea to explore the outside of this prison, but that thought vanishes soon after and is drowned by other noise in your head

Maybe you feel afraid, that you wouldn't even know who you are, if you left. And who would your friends be, once you'd leave your old life behind? Many of your mates stay in prison and they seem to be doing just fine, you don't hear them complaining. They are surprised and some might even be a little agitated, when you sometimes complain about the prison

Something doesn't seem quite right though and you can't seem to shake off this feeling.

I actually quit for like 5-6 months at the beginning of Covid last year until I relapsed again, quit again, and relapsed again. Now I’m on my most recent relapse and it’s harder than ever to quit.

As a teen, I struggled immensely with depression and anxiety. I attempted suicide at 16 and have dealt with the looming problem that is my mental health since. When I got to college, I was introduced to weed and at first it was something fun to do when I was bored. Now I feel like it’s something I have to do otherwise my anxiety will be through the roof. 

Since then, I’ve somewhat hidden my addiction from the people in my life because I don’t want them to worry about me and be disgusted with me.. I feel like a fraud all the time because I have a job and run a business so everyone thinks I’ve got everything under control when in reality, I feel like my life is constantly falling apart. 

The problem I face now is that I want to quit because I know it’s affecting my mental health really poorly but another part of me just doesn’t care or doesn’t want to do it. Maybe because I’m still productive while high? I keep exercising and meditating and trying to keep my mind off of weed but I can’t seem to go a day without it.

I have no energy and even standing for long periods of time is a test. I feel so nauseous, water makes me want to vomit. 

I know this is all normal. Especially since i'm quitting carts rather than bud (wayyyy more potent). Now I'm fairly exhausted all the time, which is hindering my pursuit of my goals. How do I balance my recovery (giving myself some slack) with pursuing my goals (since I feel like I'm reverting to the same habits just sober).

Thanks for all the kind responses during the one big urge I had in the past three weeks, didn't take much at all to convince myself not to smoke.

Barely thinking about weed except for one weird dream. I had a strange dream that I gave my stash to an old high-school teacher who wasn't even a teacher I had but my younger brother had. I basically told her to take it and ""not gonna use it myself."" Kind of cool, wasn't a dream of me using so I feel that's a good sign.

Other than that the only time I think of the stuff is when I see r/leaves on my feed or when I tell a friend of mine that I quit. 

Is this it? Have I finally grown out of my emotional attachment to marijuana? Such excitement. Three weeks of no smoking but several years of trying to get here. Every time you try it gets easier folks, just have to CBT your brain away from that shit. Hope someone else is having a similar experience right now, I know some people have stronger cravings and have trouble keeping it out of their head and I feel really lucky.

So my cat came over to my new apartment (It's my family cat) and at first she was extremely lovey dovey and I had her in the room playing with me, but then it turned sour. If you've ever played with a cat past the point they wanna be played with, they let you know. Except she hissed at me which she's never done before and I looked it up, it's a common reflex to over stimulation. So she doesn't hate you she's just over stimulated, it's quite literally too much for her to take all of everything in so she freaks out.

Thus has been the pattern of my existence for the last 4 1/2 years, except I don't hiss, I smoke. I've been in this haze in such crucial transition years (17-21) that once I'm sober the adult experience is extremely overwhelming. This just pushes me back into my hole where I exercise the only coping mechanism I've honed up to this point, Marijuana. I've recognized this isn't healthy, but I've also recognized this isn't entirely my fault. I did the best I could with what I had. I have to accept that, and continue to love myself.

I went back to intermittent use for four years (once or twice a week in the evenings, if at all) and didn’t smoke in 2019. Then in 2020, I started having difficulties with a new job and felt isolated after moving to a small town, so I thought I’d give myself a break by taking a smoke after work every now and then. That quickly turned to daily use in the evenings. I then started dating someone who had been smoking daily since she was 16. We went through quarantine together, and wake and bake became my new routine. My work situation never improved, and I continued getting high every morning, then again at lunch, and once more in the evening. I knew that I was using the drug to suppress boredom and to cope with anger at my employer and with turns in my relationship. I’ve always taken pride in having willpower and being self-sufficient, yet I couldn’t get myself not to smoke. My family also doesn’t know I’ve ever smoked at all, and that makes me feel like I’m living another life. So yesterday, I threw away my weed and all my paraphernalia. Two hours later, my girlfriend and I mutually parted ways (for reasons unrelated to weed). Today has been hard so far. I really wish I could get high to make the day go by faster and to make myself feel better, but I know that’s further proof that I need to move on from weed and confront my problems.

I have to let you go completely. I cannot keep on with our vicious cycle. If we stay together I cannot grow, I cannot be independent while you are still in my life.

It was easy for me to see how drinking was a problem in my family of origin, but it took a long time for me to accept that alcohol was a big problem in MY life as well (I’m now 47). It was easy to point the finger. I’m the successful son, the one that broke away from the family, went to college, and later got into therapy and several years of 12-step programs (ACA and CodA) to deal with my issues. I got myself together and eventually got remarried and landed an amazing, yet I couldn’t stop drinking every day. At best just a half bottle of wine, at worst I’d go ahead and drink the whole bottle. I know that’s not a lot compared to the folks that drink a fifth a day until they black out, but still it was EVERY. DAMN. DAY. It was eating away at my confidence, my self esteem, and really from feeling a sense of joy in my life or pride in myself. So like I said I got rid of the booze almost two years ago, but have had a hard time letting go of the weed too. 

I managed to quit for a whole month earlier this year, and it was like right away my life started to improve. People picked up on the change in me and everything started getting better at work and just in general. I was more chatty and upbeat, and would even strike up conversations with people I didn’t know and actually LOL when I or someone else said something funny. But by the end of that month, I was feeling really stuck. I’m an artist and find that weed absolutely unlocks my creativity, so after weeks of feeling stunted in the studio I ate an edible and it was like voila, everything clicked into place. That was 3 months ago and I’ve been using daily ever since. 

But once again I’m back to that place of feeling stuck in addiction again. Unable to break free from the dependency and hating myself, but continuing to get high again and again hoping for a feeling of well-being and joy, ignore the increasing anxiety and depression. I’ve gone back to avoiding conversations at work to hide this person I am outside of work. I’m back to feeling miserable and hating all the laughter around me. Ugh. 

I was hit with another strong temptation to say fuck it and eat a gummy, but looking through my emails I saw a post to this group from someone else who is just days into quitting again. I appreciate this group and everyone’s honesty about their struggles. I’m trying to hold on too. In fact, I feel a lot better now that I got this out.

You may have seen me around the past few weeks, so a small introduction seemed in place. :) This is my alt account, specifically made to contribute freely to this sub. 

I'm blurred-decision, 31yo, 6 days sober today, after using for 15 years ~8 joints a day, no day without smoking. Have been battling mental health problems (CPTSD) for years, and started smoking as selfmedication, besides my prescribed medication. Cleaned up from other substances and medication abuse before. Have been in denial with ""only using cannabis"" the past few years. 

Earlier attempts to quit stranded on the very first day, because of anxiety and the fear to fall back into depression. BUT NO MORE. Monday June the 21st, after waking and baking, I was sick of cannabis controlling my life. Tired of living from hit to hit. Just fed up from one moment to the other. When I finished that first joint of the day, I said to myself: this was the last one. I'm DONE. 

Still going strong since and on my sixth day of being sober now. My most prominent withdrawal symptoms are nausea, lack of appetite, night sweats, restless legs and controlling my body temperature during the day. But I had expected this, and I can handle it. I was afraid stress would be my worst enemy with fighting this addiction, but I had quite a stressfull week, and I didn't reach for any substances. No weed, no drugs, no cigarettes, no booze. Honestly, I'm surprised at myself. 

I'm very grateful for finding this sub. Reading all of your experiences is so helpful and keeps me focused. Hopefully I'm able to contribute for you too. 

If I'm able to beat this, so can you, no doubt in my mind. Thank you all for being active in this sub. We've got this.

I used to enjoy smoking in social situations, but now after 5 minutes all I'm left with is near debilitating anxiety. I can tell now that the best thing for me to do is quit. I would love to keep it on a casual basis but I know me and I know that won't work. 

I'm fully expecting it to mess up my sleep, so I've waited for a few days where I don't have to be anywhere. On the flip side of that im very excited to start dreaming again!

For the past 2 years solid I've been in the habit of smoking every day, but it's been an off and on thing for me since I was about 20. Lately I have cut back to mostly only smoking in the evening to unwind.

I've been feeling really lost and directionless in life. I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do next and it occured to me that all the times I can remember being productive and feeling positive about myself were times that I was not smoking. 

I justified my habit to myself a lot saying ""at least I'm not an alcoholic or doing opiates."" I also have had a nasty battle with endometriosis for which I used weed to self-medicate. But I wound up having a surgery with an amazing doctor about 6 weeks ago and the chronic pain went away. So that excuse is no longer valid.

I'm sick of my lungs feeling like shit. I'm sick of eating healthy all day and then ruining it because I munch out and overeat after smoking. I'm sick of being unable to focus and feeling spaced out and tired. I'm sick of wasting my time and having zero motivation. I'm tired of having to worry about getting pinched at work because my job does sporadic random tests.

It definitely is keeping me from being the best version of myself. And I'm tired of pretending that it's not.

My main hurdle is my husband. He smokes every day but he says it does not impact him negatively and does not wish to quit. I know better than to try to change his behavior. So I do just have to deal with the temptation of weed being in my house all the time.

Yesterday I did not partake and I know I can do it today too. I've quit before and I know I can do it again. I am also going to be switching shifts from working days to working evenings in a couple of weeks so I think changing my routine will be a big help.

To feel completely  immobile whole some malicious presence is somewhere in the room. Usually it's a growling. Or this static figure that will stand at the edge of my bed. 

But I haven't had it in years. So I thought I was just a thing in my teen years. Well I was proves very wrong when I quit weed. Almost within a month they came back in full force. Usually once a week, sometimes every night. And while I no longer have the mindset that I am terrified of them. They are still a big problem. I'm writing this having just come out of one. 

It's making it difficult to remain clean. As I just want a good rights rest. The thing is I usually know when it's gonna happen.

I don't enjoy using it really. It never makes me feel how I really want it to. It's been a constant drain on my wallet and social life. It makes me neglect my home, family and self. I just don't really see the point in doing it.

Yet I often do, which means I'm an addict and I have a problem.

So now I'm taking this seriously (again). I've beaten it before, and I'll beat it again. Hopefully I'll be back tomorrow for day 3.",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64224845}"

Just spewing some thoughts inspired by reading a recent comment but wrote a lot so thought I'd make my own post instead of long af comment.

I'm jealous of non-addicts. I wish I weren't one. But we don't get to choose our struggles.

I had a relapse dream recently and was thinking on what my go to line should be if/when I get offered weed in the future. I think this is what I'll say: ""I can't ever smoke again, it's not for me."" If they want to know why: ""It's bad for me/It has shitty consequences for me."" Simple.

Some can, but not me. Wise words to live by, yet so hard to accept sometimes. My jealousy towards non mj addicts is honestly often tough to reckon with though. I tried comparing it to other things. Some can eat McDonalds, every meal, every day, and have no problems, but not me. Some can drink 10 cups of coffee. Some can smoke 2 packs of cigs. Some can eat a dozen donuts. Some can drink a twelve pack. All thing legal and safe in moderation for most but not the healthiest when they become a daily habit or a go-to reflex for life or an obsessive/compulsive behavior. Not so hard for me to grasp...

**Some can't smoke weed**. That """"fun, ~~medicinal, natural~~, trendy, relaxing, safe, silly, harmless"""" (well, us who've been addicted experience it a liittle differently than the public does) little plant? Marijuana addicts (Hi 👋 we exist) can't smoke it.
Ever.
Or they lose control of their life. Or they're always holding themselves back. Or they're permenantly broke. Or their depression/mental health worsens. Or they become homeless. Or they neglect themselves, their jobs, and others. Or they spend months every year in the psychiatric hospital.

All of these terrible consequences (and more) happen to me when I smoke, without fail, every time I pick some up, ever since I started using it as frequently as I could around 4 years ago just to get through life. Yet I still get tempted to just ""have a little puff and chill"" but what follows is anything but relaxing. My life becomes a neverending race and exhausting struggle for more and more weed. And everything and everyone I actually care about in life takes the back burner to chasing it 24/7/365.
Why do I do that to myself? The satisfaction is a facade. There's no lasting accomplishment/benefits. The high is temporary and ALWAYS leaves me wanting more. I don't like alcohol and stop about 2-3 drinks in usually, no issues. But weed? Never enough for me. If I could live life permastoned, yeah, I probably would. But my life goes to shit when I try. Every time, without fail.

Some can smoke weed, BUT NOT ME! I'm part of the some that CAN'T. And that's okay. Maybe we are a bit unusual minority, but we're not freaks (even though I do feel that way around here sometimes sadly). It doesn't have to define us but it DOES have to be some part of our identity, which is kinda hard when the opposite (being a stoner) used to be a large part of me. It was how I made friends easily too.
But in order to not go to an early grave and/or lose EVERYTHING I care about in life, I can't smoke weed. I have to accept this fact. I can't control myself when it comes to marijuana and I'm someone who can't smoke weed. That's the truth. People often don't take me seriously when I say it's like crack to me, but it's true. Not my issue if they don't understand - I'm the one who needs to suck it up and accept it or else I ruin my life. It's hard to say and it still feels a bit weird, but I really need to practice this honesty with myself about my unhealthy relationship with it - that will never work out, ever - or else I'm trapped in this cycle, lucky to make it out alive.

Tldr;
Hi, I'm Joe and I'm someone who can't smoke weed. I don't smoke weed, ever since my last quit date 6/1/21. I have a marijuana addiction. It ruins my life, so I'm an ex-stoner. 
""I can't smoke, it's bad for me, so it's not my thing anymore.""

No, I'm not uptight. No, I'm not straight edge. No, I don't dislike and judge people who do. No, I don't think it should be illegal.
No, it's not harmless for me. No, I can't control my smoking. No, I will never be my best me as a stoner, but my worst. No, I don't want to stay stuck forever because of my smoking.
Yes, I can still have a fun, good life without it.

It's not something I can handle and I need to stop trying to. It's not for me. I've done plenty of research about it and always gotten the same results.

So how about instead, I do some research on what life without it is like from now on? Care to join me? No matter what, I won't smoke, today and every day.

I don't want to disappoint them. It's a long story and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.

 I had smoked heavily in college, having been introduced to it as a freshman. I enjoyed the euphoric effects and the challenge of navigating my world in an impaired state- it gave me a type of focus sometimes and a sense of accomplishment over small tasks done well.  I graduated college a few years ago and started an internship in preparation for grad school applications over the next couple of years. The internship turned out to be a traumatic experience, though. My boss was negligent at best and dehumanizing of the post-docs and interns at worst. The environment was toxic and hopeless, and I went into a deep spiral of depression. Pot turned from a substance of recreation and enjoyment to a source of numbness and just get through the evenings after work. My evenings turned into heavy smoking and playing the same video game deep into the night, to awake the next morning dreading work in a field that I thought I had loved. This went on for about a year, and I was painfully self-aware of what a disappointment I was. I hated myself for wasting my time on that couch, for being in that job, and for the time I was wasting. I became severely out of touch with my feelings because I wanted to no longer feel for the longest time. Close to the end of the first year, the pandemic struck, which changed my life in several ways. I moved out of the old position into another lab, after speaking with the program director about my experience. This aspect of my life is actually going very well, and I now enjoy work and my field of research once again. 

Over the summer, things were fine- I had developed a schedule of sleeping in, working until I got hungry for dinner, and going on runs often. Over time though, my pot use became an isolating factor- if I was getting stoned, I did not want to go out to be with other people. I ended up locking myself in my bedroom all day for months, only going out for exercise or to cook and run errands. I did not have many face-to-face interactions outside of face timing or calling my long-distance girlfriend or talking to my therapist over the phone. At this point, I felt completely dissociated- I felt out of touch with my emotions, nor did I particularly miss them. I developed a cynicism for current events, so reading the news further distanced me from the world at large. I used pot early in the day and did not stop using it until right before I went to sleep. The whole time, I hated myself for what I was doing. I tried to tell myself it was not so bad, that it doesn't matter if I smoke or not, and that I may be addicted but it's not a big deal. When I and my GF made plans for me to visit over a month, I used pot to ""time-travel"": I was not enjoying anything, so why be there to experience it, or why remember it. I just wanted time to pass in order to see her sooner. When I finally did arrive, I abstained pot a few days and felt the most fulfilled that I had that whole year. However, I soon started again, and my usage progressed from evenings to chronic morning usage. I was enjoying myself, but it began to feel hollow as I used it more and more. I began to feel ashamed over this and smothered those feelings with more usage. 

When I returned from the visit, a month later, I fell back into the same routine of self-loathing and emptiness, only it felt worse after having to leave her again. I could not turn off the sense that I was still ""time-traveling"", even if I wanted to. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, and I began the process of driving across the country to move in with my girlfriend! I was very excited, with the plan being to stop at my parent's house before the trip. I did not want to bring any weed with me on the road trip, but I brought some home with me for the last evening before the departure. That night, I vaped before I showered, and took a look in the mirror at myself in this place where I had grown up. It was hard. To me, my teeth and nails had yellowed. My eyes were heavily bloodshot and underlined with bags that had not been there just 3 years ago. I had changed, none of the differences I saw between myself as a younger person and myself now were to my liking. That was when I decided I had to quit. I could not go on like this. I texted my GF, and told her I'm not smoking anymore. I resolved to quit. 

Now, I am all moved in with her, and she has just left on a vacation for a week last night. Last night, I bought weed and smoked on our patio. I stayed up late playing video games. (What is wrong with me?) 

I woke up feeling jumbled and like I was in a state of lag. My emotions still feel dampened from the weed. I am anxious. I am scared I will do it again. I want to throw out the weed, but I want to do it again as well- I just want to pass the evenings. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about this either. I had decided to quit, I had told her I would quit, and now I am hiding it from her. Writing this is very difficult. I don't feel real, or authentic. I don't feel like anything is real anymore, and everything feels transient. The wonderful week I had, moving in, getting things done, it all feels like a distant dream, even though it was just yesterday: it feels like there is a barrier erected between myself today and who I was yesterday. It feels fake even though *I was getting better.* I've known what I ought to do: I ought to stop. I should throw out the weed, but I feel too weak to do so. What if I do it again tonight?

Everything going wrong. Feeling broke. Financial stress. Feeling lonely. Things turning south and outlook not looking positive. Looking for any escape.

Experiencing so many feelings of failure. I used to have it all, accomplished my dreams, had even more amazing goals... then I just threw it all away and burned it all to the ground.

I would think and express... “All I care about is quitting weed. I FUCKING HATE SMOKING WEED. I just want to stop but I feel like I can’t and it has such a grip on me. My main priority and goal in life is to stop and I feel like I cannot move forward until I do.”

Well I achieved that goal... But all of the pride and the feeling success of finally being able to stop still isn't here. 

I don’t feel good and I’m not happy. I wish I could be celebrating and feel so proud but instead I am burdened by the ruin in which I find myself. 

I had everything I ever could have dreamed and I just threw it all away and today I wish I could just rewind and have my old life back.

I’m sitting here typing this, in tears and total breakdown, because r/Leaves is my greatest support.

I know that coming here and writing is my best option to overcome my impulse and compulsion to relapse. Maybe my words help someone else. 

I do not want to lose my progress and I know that weed will not cure the way I’m feeling. But today is the biggest challenge I’ve faced in 116 days of sobriety.

Smoked for the first time when I was 15, by 17 I was pretty much always high. Now I'm 24 and basically would never leave the house without my grinder full of weed and a pipe already packed up. 

Between being really antisocial when I smoke, coughing all the time, spending stupid amounts of money to keep up my habit, and just general laziness, I've been saying for a long time I wanted to quit. But any time I try I get serious withdrawal, completely loose my appetite, and usually cave and hit my guy up within a day, maybe two.  

The other day though I decided it's time. Or at least the universe did. 

I was out of weed again and wasnt gonna be able to get any for at least a day. I was already so desperate for a hit I was cleaning out my pipe to get what resin I could to smoke. Already just about the worst possible thing to smoke, but I felt like I needed it. All the sudden in the middle of cleaning out my pipe I heard a little cracking noise. In my desperation to get a hit I cracked the inside of my bowl. For a moment my heart sank. Not only had I had this pipe for years and felt some kind of bond with it, but it was my main way of smoking. Now I wasn't just out for the day, I was out until I could get a new piece. 

It was in this moment I made a choice. I took my pipe down to the basement that has concrete floors, raised it up as high as I could lift it, and dropped it. Bowl first. And as expected, it shattered. I decided if I couldn't smoke, I wouldn't smoke. 

That was 5 days ago. I haven't smoked since then. The withdrawals actually weren't that bad this time. And even though it's only been a few days I'm already feeling like it's getting easier. I think on Monday I'm gonna give my grinder to a buddy so that's one less thing to tempt me. 

I'm sure there are gonna be a lot of temptations, but I think this is the start of something good. I feel like after a few days sober my mind is clearer. I haven't been coughing nearly as much, and thinking about all the money I'll save if I keep this up is a big incentive.

is my life sunshine and rainbows now that i'm a year clean? nope. do i still crave substance-based distractions and sometimes think that an activity would be more fun if i was on something? yep. and my motivation issues are still very present in my life despite not smoking all day everyday.

i say all of this to just point out that there's no magical fix that comes with sobriety, especially if you have underlying mental issues like i do. life will always require more work on my part because that is just the hand i've been dealt. i also have an addict's brain, so dealing with cravings will probably be a lifelong thing as well.

i can say, though, that things are a lot calmer and clearer and easier not being a smoker. my anxiety & panic attacks come very infrequently. i have much less daily paranoia. my social anxiety has lessened and i feel more confident when being out with people (because im not worrying about seeming stupid from being high). i'm more present in my life and thus more ready to do tasks that i need to get done, even though i still have procrastination issues. 

i just feel more... stable. normal. and god, i never knew how good normal felt till getting out of the haze of weed & alcohol i was in for like 9 years.

so TL;DR i haven't smoked in a year and though not smoking hasn't turned me into some successful & active go-getter, it has made me feel more calm and stable and ready to take steps i never would have bothered to when i was high 24/7. don't expect a magic fix but you can at least look forward to the beauty of normalcy.",34,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.43976894}"

So two years of binge smoking. I’m talking $500+ of weed a month people- I hid the high well because after a while I didn’t feel it anymore. I had to smoke more and more to get high at all, and going without, hurt. 

It’s now late June 2021, I quit December 2nd, 2020. I remember because I got high on my twin sisters’ birthdays, and ended up in the ER because that joint for whatever reason made me feel as though I was having a heart attack. Havent felt the same since, or smoked since.

Now here i am six months later with chronic insomnia, hypnic jerks, memory issues, light sensitivities, auditory processing issues and sensitivities, and a constant permitting pain that I can only describe like this: You know those prank gum sticks that shock you when you grab them? Imagine that, but it’s your entire body, just enough that you can feel it, *all the time*. 

Fibromyalgia is a different kind of pain because, in the way I understand it working anyway, your nervous system is overstimulated all the time. It’s not understood how the brain malfunctions in its command to incessantly fire off your nerve endings like this, and while it’s treatable, there’s no solid cure. Im awaiting a neurologist appointment at the end of next month to confirm, but I personally believe that refusing to leave my body alone and give it some kind of break from the weed, caused that ‘heart attack’ feeling back in December and may have been what caused this. Especially considering this has only developed since I quit six months ago.

My whole adult life I have smoked daily. I tried Day 1 yesterday but I caved 18 hours in. I am a 24-year-old female from Canada, where weed is legal. I've been smoking for 6 years, multiple times a day. Originally I started smoking to deal with emotional distress, anxiety, and depression, but now weed has become a crutch. If I am home, I can smoke every hour all day - probably 20 bong hits a day.

I feel alone in this journey because I have always smoked alone. None of my friends or family smoked weed daily, monthly, or at all. So they can't really relate to why I smoke so much weed in the first place and then how it feels to suddenly stop. They can't even really understand the magnitude of my weed problem since most of it is done behind closed doors. I've held jobs, relationships, and appearances in general without being too noticeable. Weed has slowly changed my life and dragged me deeper and deeper into a hole, but no one noticed. On the outside, there is no real explanation for how I went from a preppy, high achiever to a withdrawn, suppressed homebody. 

The withdrawal symptoms are worse than I thought they were going to be. I feel like I am on other drugs when I am not on weed. It feels like a never-ending come down. Restless energy under my skin, hot flashes, sweating, can't think, can't sleep, can't eat. It feels like I can't function without weed. My bowel movements are definitely not cute either. And after researching late (after I had already quit), it seems like these effects are going to last longer than I thought. 

Weed has been my one constant for 6 years, and I don't know what I'm going to do without it. Because of this feeling, I am really doubting the fact that I can get through this. Day 1 is horrible, I can't even imagine Day 5, Day 10, etc.

I won't go too much into the details of just how much we smoked or how it affected my professional life, but I can assure you it became problematic. One of the things that made it difficult to even cut down on my consumption was the fact that I used to smoke with my best friend. This was someone that I went to work with, lived next to, partied with, played videogames with and talked to whenever I was feeling down. Everything we did together had to involve taking a few hits right before ""to make it interesting"" or right after to talk about it while high.
 
All in all, I smoked every day for about 5 years. 

Eventually it all caught up to me. I couldn't take a deep breath without literally hearing the tar and mucous clogging up my lungs. My throat was constantly sore and I would have to clear it 4-5 times per minute, no kidding. I could barely hold my breath for 30 seconds and walking, which used to be one of my favorite activities before, became very difficult. Then COVID came. I became sick, but fortunately not sick enough to go to a hospital. When I told my friend that I had to quit and that I did not want to smoke anymore you can imagine what his response was. 

This post is not about how I lost a best friend, but about the teachings that came my way once I pulled the emergency brake for the sake of my health and a prosper life with my girlfriend:

- A friendship doesn't need to be eternal for you to look back and consider that it was a real friendship


- There are different types of friendships and you shouldn't mix their purposes, don't take life advice from someone who is just a ""party friend""


- Don't underestimate how much of a friend's lifestlye can rub off on you without you even noticing

And when it comes to cravings, I wish there was a magic word I could tell you to make them instantly go away. That being said, there are a few things that I remind myself of whenever they become pariticularly bad:

- No craving is eternal, certainly not a weed craving. You won't crave weed every day, just like you won't crave ice cream or chips every day. 


- A craving is just another form of anxiety and weed is not the only cure or even the best cure. I promise that if you do something with your hands or your body, like going for a light jog, you'll feel better.


- Never forget about the cravings that go away once you quit weed for good. I can tell you that I havent been to McDonalds (an old munchies favorite) since I quit and I haven't taken an afternoon nap in forever, which is something that was a  daily necessity after burning myself out.


I hope this helps at least one person, I have lurked in r/leaves for a bit now to stay strong and I felt it was my time to contribute.

It’s been quite a while since I had any major kind of milestone to work towards (reaching a year was the last milestone of note) and as I crept towards this one I took regular note of how I felt and how things had changed in anticipation of writing this post.

Back in the early days of trying to be sober I remember having thoughts of “I’ll smoke on day 100 and then I'll restart the clock” and having the weight of that triple digit number weigh on me. This then returned as “I’ll smoke on day 150 and then restart the clock” and then the loudest one of all, “I’ll smoke on my birthday, what’s the point of being sober anymore I don’t see any benefits”. And honestly? Sometimes that’s how it goes. We do lose hope and fail to see our own progress. At around the time of my birthday I was pretty much 6 months clean and was losing hope but somehow I held on. And in large part I think that was due to the support I had gained from people here on r/leaves and the people over in the Discord server. Thank you all for that…

But here, right now, coming up to being 10 months down the line from that, things are different. I quit in February of last year and had not known a sober Christmas for a long time. And yet? Christmas didn’t topple me. It didn’t keep me awake at night worrying about how I’d get through it. I made a conscious plan of how to deal with any potential situations running up to it and went from there. And that’s how I’ve continued to behave. New situation? New milestone or old anniversary coming up? I think about it, plan how to get through it and use the tools I’ve built so far to keep me on the right track. Staying sober and working with (and on) the tools I have to stay that way has become almost as much of a habit as taking drugs and other chemicals used to be 🙃

As previously mentioned, the people here and in the Discord server have been a great asset in my recovery. Community. Pretty much every day I turn up to at least one session (whether I post or not) for accountability and I think it’s really helped. I think having accountability and a community (whether here or there) can be the difference between making it or not. And in one of the greatest honours of all, I’m currently a part of the mod team of both places. Being able to give back is such a gift and honour and I hope I never take that for granted. Being able to post here in itself is a gift and an honour and I hope I never take that for granted either. 

So yeah, here I am, 500 days sober. I’ve slipped up with other addictions for sure, but during my weed quit I made the decision to permanently cut out the other stuff which influenced my weed use. And I think that’s helped. I don’t mind being straight edge, in fact, I love it. And I love my life. Never in my wildest dreams would I ever think that I, the saddest most cynical and defeated person I’ve ever known, could be sitting here now content.

Yet I am.

I’ve been an avid watcher of posts and supported those who I see deal with the same problems I’m having in my life. I’ve come to the point in my life where I either let me choose my path on where I want to end up or let weed choose for me. 

I’ve been a daily smoker for 7 years through high school and college. I have only once been strong enough to quit for a short period of time after I got arrested for it. Even then I was only strong enough to hold out for 3 months and then I started risking it in probation by quitting 2 weeks before the possibility of being tested. Fortunately I never got caught but it was an awful way to live in constant anxiety. 

Now I have graduated college and need to make the decisions that are going to better me. It’s taking a toll on my relationship with my girlfriend of 3 years who can’t trust me with weed because I’ve lied so many times to her about it. She’s the one I want to marry and can’t lose her for something that I don’t want in my life anymore. It has controlled me, kept me anxious, depressed, hindered my opportunities by being complacent, and suppressed issues I have with things that happened in my childhood. I’m done letting it control me.

Another thing is I’m just pushing back my opportunities to get a job because in my field I will most likely have to pass a drug test. And I would hate myself if I lost an opportunity due to something that doesn’t even make me happy anymore. 

Today is going to be day 1 after quitting for a week then relapsing and that’s been the cycle for me. I realize that every time I smoke again it doesn’t bring me happiness anymore, just more anxiety and grief. I hope I can receive some positive messages because I need them.

I never thought I had a problematic relationship with it until one day,  in a fit of nostalgia I was thinking about a classic  90s hood movie, New Jack City.  The movie is set in '86, I believe, during the height of the craack epidemic and there's a character, Pookie, played by Chris Rock (pretty good performance I  might add) who was addicted. In one scene he mentions that, ""I can't help it man, this crack shit got me. I tried to kick but I can't, the shit just be calling me, man, I gotta go to it."" I remember thinking at the time, ""yeah, sometime's I can feel the weed calling me."" In the split second before the realization fully hit my brain intercepted with ready-made excuses: ""yeah but that's different because of x,y and z reasons."" 

Sadly, even after realizing this I went back to using, even though I told myself I would stop. I had cut down and would go for months sober but would always come back to it, because I would always convince  myself that just a little here and there wouldn't hurt. You know how this story goes. I'd tell myself, ""ok, I'll get just a little and then stop, this time  it'll be different."" It was never different. After about a onth-long binge and after having burnt through all my money I'd stop and tell myself the same thing. Then a few months later the story repeats. 

After the most recent binge I realize that I've been using it as a tool to basically take a break from life when it got too hard. The weed allowed me to disappear into my own little world where it was just music, movies, food, and where problems didn't exist. I've realized I have some emotional problems as a result of my upbringing and I really want to solve them but it will not be possible if I keep using cannabis and alcohol. So, I will NOT be using it on special occasions and I will NOT be testing the product of different places I plan to travel  to like I (or I should say the addiction originally decided). 100% abstinence is the only way forward and this post is me finally admitting and acknowleding that.

I don’t think this would trigger a full on relapse, especially since it would be 100% outside of my normal smoking environment.

I was so fired up, I made my resolutions, I told myself I  was really going to tackle 2021 and make some serious strides. I had every right to believe in myself. I've been holding down a fulltime job since 2015, I had recently sold a house and was in the market for another, and I had just genuinely been developing ambivalence towards my Weed use, beginning around 2015. 

My stoner-buddy came into town to visit on 01/03/2021 . He lives in Colorado and has been a bonafide stoner since we were about 14. We hung out, played golf, went out for some food and drinks, and then he invited the guys back to his house to smoke up. Though, I knew turning down the Session was the right thing to do, but I wanted to partake, so I did.

That decision alone, altered the course of 2021 for me. It's like, when you decide to smoke and return to daily smoking, you are simultaneously putting your aspiration, goals, and general happiness on pause. Be honest with yourself, are you on the ball, when you are actively using? Can you manage all of life's demands, along with your habit? For me the answer is no. The reality is my life is eons better, when I do not smoke. I know this, I can acknowledge it, and yet I am still susceptible to weed usage. That is text-book addiction right there.

I'm going to condense this because, it's a long story frankly. I began smoking in January, here we are in June. I haven't smoked in 2 days. That's a feat. Though, had you told me I'd still be smoking in June, back in Jan, I would not believe you. You think you have this under control.

For background, I have been smoking since I was a sophomore in high school and now I am twenty two. So seven ish years. I was consistently smoking (every day when I had the cash) for 5.5 years before I decided it was time to stop. Prior to this, I was dabbing throughout the day and I would get so high that even without smoking I would be high the next day. I realized that it was ruining my life and I had gained a significant amount of weight from overeating so I tried to stop. First it was putting my remaining weed away and stuff like that but I realized that as long as I had access I would smoke. I ended up just finishing what I had and not buying any more. This lasted for a few weeks and started a cycle if me being ""clean"" for a few weeks and then buying some weed so I could smoke ""occasionally"" but smoking it all in days.  I am still stuck in this cycle and the longest I've went without weed is three months. Those three months were great and my mental health was the best it ever was. I still probably drank too much but I was able to limit it to the weekends and cut alcohol out completely after a while. Now I've went out and bought more weed, and I am starting the cycle over yet again. Weed is becoming legal in my state soon and I'm scared that I will become worse because of it. Does anyone feel similar? I find myself wanting to smoke and feel ""good"" and maybe even ""cool"" but when I smoke I feel like shit.

Im currently 3 weeks into my final withdrawal and I am 31 years old. I have used weed for 10+ years to self medicate and treat my depression and anxiety issues. The depressive thoughts got way better in the beginning but much more severe the longer I was consuming. I have always felt bad to be addicted to anything and thought that weed was ruining my life. This thought pattern made it impossible to quit, until I realized that weed was just a symptom and that I was always doing stuff excessively since I was a kid. Ive been excessive with everything: reading books, collecting trading cards, cartoon network, cigarettes, masturbation,…. The moment I stopped one thing another took over. This has lead me to the realization that I am always trying to feel better by adding something external for a short pleasure, instead of developing the inner love for myself that is needed to make it through this life addiction free. If you bought a racing horse for 100K would you give it weed, would you feed it with fast food? Why do you treat yourself like this then? The journey of healing and starting my own life finally came with a couple of realizations. 1. I am not my thoughts, i can decide what I want to think about myself. 2. Depression is thinking too much about the past. 3. Anxiety is thinking too much about the future. 4. Living and enjoying the present moment as often as possible is true happiness. 5. If you dont love yourself, you can never truly love another being.

Now before quitting I have already developed a certain schedule to keep my occupied and healthy. Daily 20 Mins of meditation, wim hof breathing after waking up, 30 sec of ice cold water after every shower, a vegan diet full of fresh veggies, Exercising (Yoga, bike, running, climbing are my favourites). In addition to that i switched to a dynavap before quitting and constantly reduced the amount. The first 2 weeks quitting were really good, only had some anger issues and trouble falling asleep. Now I use a bit of nonactive flowers every other day to make it easier for myself, it helps for sure. Ive tried to quit countless times but this time I have changed my mindset to being a nonstoner before quitting and I treat myself like a temple. Its a walk in the park compared to all the other times. Learn to love yourself and you will break free from addictions. I hope this helps some people out there, dont hesitate to pm me, Im happy to help.

It is a bubble where I forget that, deep down, I don't like myself.

The intoxication is a distraction to the fact that I'm deeply alone and that I can't let anyone in on my life. It is a way to feel superior while stuck in a well. Whenever I stop smoking for a few days, this reality drops down on me even harder, and it becomes unbearable. Smoking, and alcohol to a lesser extent, are the only things that make me feel like my life isn't shit at this moment.

I have exactly 5 bucks to my name and I really want to be independent. This struggle is intertwined with my desire for independence from weed. Both of them imply the same thing: becoming an adult. Just growing up, once and for all. It doesn't matter if age is just a number, growing up isn't something that society forces up on you. It's something natural that benefits you and the people around you; growing up is a gift in and of itself.

I have 3 friends who consume weed regularly who are still extremely productive go-getters who get things done and are successful in their professional & personal lives. The types of people who never get any type of anxiety or paranoia when they smoke, and are never impeded by their use. They drive wherever, socialize, work in high stress environments etc. and weed never slows them down.

I am NOT one of ""those"" people. I keep lying to myself that I can be that type of a person, but to no avail. Or I shame myself that there must be something wrong with me if I can't be how these people are while high or smoking regularly. The way weed affects me is very different from how it affects the aforementioned type of person. This is something I have to come to terms with and accept.

I cannot have weed and life success at the same time.

Weed causes me extreme social anxiety, paranoia, disassociation, lethargy, lack of motivation, depression and lack of interest, and an extreme sense of laziness. I'm the type of person that can barely hold a text conversation while high due to the anxiety it causes me. I can't really function in most capacities while high and I like to be high all of the time. These two things obviously cannot go together if I am going to be successful in life.

I guess it just sucks that I can't be one of ""those"" people. I need to be sober and conscientious of my work ethic and productivity in order to be properly productive. Weed sends my baseline in the other direction and I become a lazy sack of shit with a lot of wasted potential who doesn't find anything interesting.

For 8 years, I've wasted my potential into my late twenties out of contentedness and complacency. I've had jobs and been promoted, but always in dead-end industries where I didn't even want the next promotion that could have been offered. Going to work and coming home to do virtually nothing but getting high and wondering why time is passing me by and I'm not moving forward in life, why all of my peers are flying past me in life milestones. Thinking it was the job(s) causing me so much lethargy that I couldn't go to school while working full time, or go get training or certification in something, or learn new skills, or really put effort into side gigs and projects, or save any money.. anything.

I've allowed so much time to go by basically living the same week on repeat. All because weed gives me the illusion that when I get home from work, my day is done and I don't need to do anything else to push my life forward.

Since then, I’ve been trying to find information online about how long it would take for my memory, learning, and other executive functioning skills to return, only to find articles and papers about how difficult this is for users who began during adolescence. This terrifies me. My lost memories make me so sad, I find it extremely hard to learn and retain information, making me feel so useless in my new job as a researcher in bio science, and my motivation to start tasks is groundbreakingly low. I naively thought these things would immediately improve once I stopped, and now I’m not quite sure where to go now I’ve realised this isn’t the case. 

I’m posting here because I’m hoping to find some advice or people in similar situations, and wondering if it really is impossible to reverse the damage I’ve done.

I’m now 24 & coming to terms with the reality that I can never casually smoke if I want to be sober. I’ve quit for decent periods of times before but always believed I can moderate my usage only to become fully addicted again for months smoking multiple times a day. My most recent relapse lasted a little over a month of multiple joints in a day. I knew I wanted to stop but the beginning part of quitting is always the hardest for me. I’m now on Day 4, and thankfully I feel okay again. The first 2 days were horrible. I got frustrated over the silliest things and would cry, I couldn’t eat, felt like life would never be fun again. I’m happy to feel back to how I was before I relapsed but i also feel disappointed that I have relapsed so many times before. I have made a promise to myself to never go back. My only concern moving forward is that I don’t enjoy drinking (at all!!!) so I always relapse because I rationalize that it’s ok to have a joint at a party for my own way to “partake in the party antics”. My friends would usually stop pressuring me to drink when I would smoke a joint. But, I hate drinking and now I can’t smoke at parties…I’m worried about my social life but I know being sober from weed is way more important than looking cool for people. (My dislike of alcohol doesn’t stem from the taste or stuff like that. My dad was a severe alcoholic, as was my brother & I have seen the impacts on them & myself. I refuse to become an alcoholic so I don’t enjoy drinking. I don’t enjoy it so much so that when I do try to drink casually, I will genuinely have a panic attack when I feel drunk because I feel like I’m losing control and will become an alcoholic).

Appetite is slowly coming back, paired with exercise it is nice to really feel your emotions again. I’ve cried more in this past week than I have in the past year, but all of that were tears of relief and joy, which felt good to let out. Music and hot showers are the best way for me to curb any cravings, and I haven’t had much. I’ve been over to some buddies houses where they smoked but I abstained and just watched. Never realized how dirty it is, coughing and spitting shit up into the trashcan. It made me appreciate what I’m doing with myself right now. I also live alone so there’s not much to distract me besides work, gym, and movies. 

Life without weed is so much better than being high everyday. My problem was I thought it was soo cool to smoke and be high, be different from everyone. Well I’ll say it’s not and it’s kind of cringy to have to be dependent on a substance. Mind feels so much more clear now.

I had been completely off all forms of THC for 9 months and then I relapsed. I allowed myself to believe two delusions:  

1. there was still something worthwhile left in marijuana FOR ME

2. i had control over my usage of weed. 

Long story short, neither was true and I binged for three months straight, blew 1000s, lost all my gains, failed a class, damaged a few relationships, and became super depressed.  

&#x200B;

When I really accept these two statements, I actually understand how poisonous weed is (for me). 

See a lot of us addicts share one thing in common. Somewhere, sometime ago, we internalized that we do not deserve the best.  I don't know who told us that, and who told them that, but it was internalized. We now believe that  might deserve meh, or mediocrity, or evil, or even something decent. But we believe we don't deserve IT. Whatever IT may be. 

We self sabotage for a living, finding ways to do what we know best. To give up. We feel so comfortable in misery and surrender and so fearful of success, as if it's a fluke or will be ripped from us at any moment. 

I now started to understand that this belief lies deep in my spirit. Guiding me, comforting me, urging me towards emptiness, because it was all it knew and that's a whole lot easier than the unknown. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, I have also started to understand that a victim mentality and obsessing over this belief will get me nowhere. To some extent they are part of the paradigm and reenforce this false mentality.\\ I do not need to do anything in order to free myself of my old beliefs. 

In fact, I am already free. These beliefs actually have no power over me, and are not the steering wheel in my life, but rather the annoying backseat driver who doesn't know how to shut up. See just like the backseat driver, I can't kick these beliefs out of my mind. And just like the backseat driver, I don't have to listen to any of them.

I started smoking heavily because I got furloughed due to COVID. During last year I lost my grandfather, my best friend's mom and then my dog and the weed helped me NOT cope with all of that. Recently, I had a massive panic attack that nearly sent me to the hospital. I realized it was time to stop smoking. So I just stopped.

Then, the symptoms of withdrawal started. The thing I experienced at the very beginning was extreme anxiety, stomach issues, absolute loss of appetite, shakes and dysphoria. The anxiety has continued, though it has lessened quit a bit over the days. I have thought about smoking some weed to make these feelings go away, recently.

Breathing heavy, cant speak, sometimes I even welcomed nauseae. Then it was a good head in my thoughts. I mean I literally searched for this feeling especially the last two years. That's insane.

I was functioning. Nobody would suspect it. My career is in design, so I could smoke and work. I even told myself that I could work better when high, cause creativity and shit, blabla. 
Not true. The addictive habit surpresses creativity. I worked more hours and more creative the last two days than the last two weeks before quitting. I know also to cope and distract myself but I hope it transfers into a natural, good thing.

Already experiencing possible withdrawal symptoms.,"TL;DR I smoked what I assume was very strong weed that was too harsh for my rookie level tolerance (I had only started smoking consistently a month before and I would smoke like two or three times a night for a few weeks) which scared me, thinking about my poor health choices, into a severe panic attack that lead to an ER visit. They found nothing wrong outside of elevated BP but now I can’t sleep well as my heart races when I try to and I’m highly aware of it, and I tend to manually breathe when the anxiety set in. I hate this feeling, but it’s enough to make me say for certain that I don’t ever want to touch weed again. It’s just nice to know I’m not alone, but it all feels so confusing starting out. I regret doing what I did, but most of all I just want to feel like myself again. 

To start, I’m a 26YO male of moderately alright health, I don’t really exercise much outside of occasional strenuous activity like helping family move furniture or fixing things around the house every so often, and I have a somewhat shitty diet, so I’m a tad chubby but not overweight. I hadn’t been to a primary care doctor in years so I’ve always had worries about my health that sat in the back of my mind. Not to mention my family also has a history of high BP on both sides, with both of my grandparents on my mother’s side surviving cardiac events last year and my mother having a false alarm with bad arm pain. It’s spooked me a lot.

Which brings my to yesterday, when I had my first visit to the ER after a few nights of trying a high THC strain which resulted in mild to severe panic attacks every night. Chest pains, tremors, immense fear, the whole 9 yards. Fortunately the staff treated me with care and were quick in their examinations and found nothing wrong outside of an elevated blood pressure (throughout the night my readings ranged from 140-150/70-80 when it’s normally around the 130/80 range) and minor spikes in heart rate which they chalked up to the harsh anxiety. It left me “somewhat” relieved after so many years of not knowing, and sparked a stronger interest in my maintaining better health. I have a follow up in a week so they can establish more information but I may try to fit in a visit sooner just to ease my worries a bit.

Now on to what kind of confuses me. The rest of this will be pretty long winded so bear with me as I try to explain. I’m rather inexperienced with flowers as I haven’t really been smoking for too long. I’ve only smoked consistently for about a few months on and off. I smoked once as a teen and had a bad experience which kept me away/made me apprehensive about weed for a long while up until just last year when I slowly eased my way into smoking with friends and my dad, and it became enjoyable. From then on I mainly smoked in social settings, but never on my own, until earlier this year in May. I bought a half ounce of some nice bud and fell in love with how it made me feel and I began smoking every single night right before I ate. Afterwards I would play some video games or watch movies for a few hours and go right to sleep. I was hooked on the sensation and every night I’d smoke a little more until I eventually ran out, but I needed more. 

When it came time to restock I had looked into the available strains before buying and noticed the 100%indica/high THC content of what they had available, I had no idea it would hit any different, I just wanted something to get me back to that good feel. Upon my first few hits of this new batch (Garanimals and Purple Kush) I noticed it just didn’t hit right for me. The high felt heavy and deep, as if I was wading underwater but floating and being stretched apart at the same time. I became aware of my heartbeat getting faster, my breaths felt short but I brushed it off as the response to stronger weed and my low tolerance. I kept smoking more for the next few nights thinking if I dug deeper it would build up my tolerance and I could get to that amazing high I loved so much, but all I experienced night after night was that horrible trip. It all came to a head when I decided to smoke around 3 AM. I had slept all day prior and woke up in the middle of the night and did my usual of smoking before grabbing some food. I realized I was consistently getting high on an empty stomach so I tried easing up on my intake and took about 2 small pulls just to get me going. The high was still just as bad, and felt even worse as a groggy feeling crept over me on top of the other bad feelings. My head felt tingly and my eyes had a slight pressure behind them which put me over the anxious edge again. I tried deep breathing and telling myself it was all in my head but it really didn’t help. Despite that, I just kept with the deep breathing for the duration of the high until I felt I was surfacing and foolishly took one last small pull to see if another decrease in dosage would treat me better. It didn’t. More of the same sensation which lead to more anxiety. After a few hours the bad high and anxiety didn’t feel like it was going away, and came on and off throughout the rest of the day, after only smoking in the early morning hours. My chest was tight and I felt fatigued, but I powered trough it thinking “it’ll be over soon” which is did as time went on. Afterwards I decided to do some laundry and clean a little. I would go up and down the stairs lifting baskets of clothes and begin to breathe heavy after a trip of two but I was able to regain composure after some deep breathing, but it kept coming back. Later in the evening as I was about to lay down to sleep for the slightly tight chest and anxiety feeling crept back up and was even stronger which I thought was strange given I hadn’t touched any weed for the rest of the day. Queue more anxiety, I thought “why am I still feeling like this?” and l figured I would just sleep it off. I eventually dozed off before ultimately jolting back awake feeling a bit worse, with shakes/chills and even what felt like slight pain in my arm. It was at that moment I decided to call 911. My mother had to handle the call as I tried to stay calm and wait for the ambulance. They arrive, take my vitals, and say I seem to be fine and it could just be an anxiety attack but ask if I want to take the ride just in case which I did. It was around this time that I began to relax and the horrible anxiety began to go away. I felt better for the rest of the night until I got back home and tried to sleep after taking a single low dose sleep supplement (still super cautious) to see if it would help. I managed to get about 2 hours of sleep before being woken up by the anxiety and somewhat fast, strong heartbeats which kept me up and now I’m writing this. 

I do apologize for the extremely long wall of text. If you’ve read this far then I thank you for hearing me out. It gives me a bit of calm as I type this out but ultimately I’m just looking for insight from my peers. I know it will pass, but how long do I have to feel like this? I what can I do to make it better? Am I actually in withdrawal? And why did I develop it after such a short time of consistent use? I look forward to your responses. I don’t want to really find definitive answers, but only a little comfort in community as I weather the storm.

I found myself thinking about this from Bojack whenever I had any sort of cravings, it also helps remind me that this is a one day at a time kind of thing. I think ahead to being a month sober and it seems like so little time but it feels so far away at the same time but you have to think that a month sober is 30 days in which you made the decision not to consume. That's insane, we all got this, we can do this.

Anyway, apart from the insane dreams, barely sleeping, weird appetite and semi frequent headaches, i'm feeling pretty good. I didn't use to smoke very often during the day so im fine during it, when the night comes that's when I feel it. For the past 3-4 years I had been pretty much zooted almost everyday after 7pm, I was lucky enough to get a ps5 the same day I quit so I have a solid distraction there for the nights. I'm avoiding taking sleep medication since I feel I would just find myself dependent on that to sleep which isn't a solution.  I've been working a lot on this short film i'm gonna start shooting soon (part of the reason I decided to quit) and even though it's only been 3 days I feel like i've put in a lot more effort than I had beforehand. I also have been exercising everyday which definitely helps.

Edit: Forgot to mention one of the hardest parts that I haven't had to deal with yet but I did the last time I quit. Most of my friends also smoke a lot and I haven't really seen any of them since I quit this time, I know it'll be soon until I do and even though some of them were supportive last time, some of them just couldn't genuinely understand why I was quitting and egging me to smoke. I will not give in to the peer pressure and I know some of you may be in the same boat so i'm here to remind you to not give in to the pressure.

2021-06-24 00:20:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/o6tf1q/day_one_over_and_over_and_over/,Day One over... and over... and over...,"My first time quitting, I made it about a month. I missed the ganja, of course; I missed how it made me feel that first time, when everything in the world went from dull to magical. I knew I was lying to myself when I reminisced, and that the vast majority of the highs had been a mediocre slip into numbness. After a month of sobriety, I felt clearer, cleaner, stronger than ever... and yet when my stoner friends passed the joint, my temptation got the better of me and I sucked the poison into my lungs. Three months just disappeared. 

The next day one I knew what to expect. Vivid dreams, mood swings, headaches - all tough, but manageable. Sobriety was worth it. I could look back at the last few months and realise that the only time I'd actually achieved anything in a year was when I was sober. But there was something else too; a little voice in my head that hadn't been there for my first time quitting. *You're going to relapse anyway, so what's the point?* I knew it was my addiction doing the talking, just like before, the same colour in a different shade, but this time it had evidence to back it up. I'd had 0 successful attempts at quitting and 1 unsuccessful. The odds were stacked against me, and I failed. Over and over and over. I don't know how many weeks I tried, tried, tried again and would end up back out the back of my apartment, secretly clicking my lighter and praying that no-one would find me. Every time, the voice got a little more evidence of my failure. 5 unsuccessful attempts. 10. Why bother? I never made it past seven days. 

Last month, I finally got a grip of myself, and made it to day fourteen, starting to grasp at some clarity. It was for a woman, of course. I want to be better for her, for both of us. I want to show her that I can be more than this lost addict with no future or ambition or soul, that I'm someone worth being, someone worth knowing. Then on Monday, this train wreck of a mood swing hits me and before I know it, I'm on the brink of killing myself. The fuck? I feel numb and angry and lost and alone and I'm in my car and I'm driving, and driving, and driving, and I close my eyes and think that anything is better than this, and before I know it, I've messaged my dealer, the joint is between my lips and every puff feels like a warm hug that makes me feel okay. But at what cost? I'm right back where I started. How can the one thing that makes my life better be the same thing that makes it all so much worse? 

I know I have underlying problems that I need to address. I guess I just wanted to vent it out. Last night I had the most detailed dream that I lost her, that it was all for nothing. I'm sick of the dreams. I'm sick of starting over.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6231279}"

It’s so contradictory because I feel with time I will achieve true happiness if I completely abstain from thc. I know deep down I am truly addicted to weed and if I want to be the best version of myself I need to abstain completely 100%.

As a result, I always saw pot as my savior.  

I'm now 40 and I'm finally realizing that I have never learned to cope with any adversity.  I have always smoked away my hurt, worry, or concern.  I have never dealt with anything in a healthy manner.  

I've been in so many relationships with good women that were ruined because if I we went through any issues and I didn't have pot to make me numb, I wouldn't know how to deal with the situation and I would shut down.  

Being 40 and realizing that I seriously have not coped with anything in a healthy way in my whole life is a real bummer.  Don't be like me.  Addiction of any kind is bad, but using a drug as an emotional crutch for 26 years of your life is quite frankly, heartbreaking.  

The good news is, I hate the shit and I have for a while. I have been aware of this failure but I never acted to fix it. I just got out of a terribly emotionally abusive relationship and I'm finally on the path to sobriety.  Things are looking great and I'm already over the worst of the withdrawals.

Here’s my experience: I am 46 days sober today and it’s been the longest, hardest and scariest 46 days of my life. I stopped smoking randomly when one day it just didn’t “work” the same way when I was in a high anxiety state of mind so I thought “screw this, if it doesn’t help anymore I’m done with it”… so I quit CT after almost constant daily use for 2 years. 

Week 1: In acute withdrawal I had a ton of the typical withdrawal symptoms both physical and mental. Sweating, heart racing, dissociation, intrusive thoughts, inability to sleep & eat, literally almost not functioning. I went to urgent care and got an ekg which showed my heart was fine. I went to my doctor who had no idea about marijuana withdrawal. I talked to my therapist who also had no clue about it. 

Week 2: I went on vacation during the second week of acute withdrawal and despite my hopes it didn’t get better, and the fact that I wasn’t better after 2 weeks made me feel worse. Since then it’s been a rollercoaster of slowly feeling a little better, like .01% per day, and sometimes backtracking to feeling worse. I kept struggling with sleepless nights, physical anxiety in the middle of the night/morning, feeling “out of it” and strange, lots of racing thoughts, self loathing, depressed feelings, anhedonia, etc. I thought there was no end in sight and realized I was just beginning PAWS. But then…

Week 3-4: I noticed I could slowly eat better, then it was even better than when I was smoking (and I gained some desperately needed weight back), and in turn I started to see more improvement in my mood. Still stuck in my head and my health anxiety was through the roof a lot, but was more manageable.

Week 5: For two days last week I woke up with no anxiety feelings in my chest and the sweating disappeared. I felt more present and calm most days. 

Week6: Two days so far *this* week I was able to sleep a lot better (8hrs even one night) and wake up feeling as close to normal as I can remember. Today I didn’t have to watch my nephew so I called my boss and asked to pick up a shift (I quit my daycare job *temporarily* on the week I quit smoking and took on watching my 1yr old nephew instead). It wasn’t awful like I was worried it would be!  My job was a huge trigger for my addiction due to how high stress it is. I came home with some residual anxiety feelings in my chest but no craving to sneak off into the garage to smoke like I used to do every day! I’m so proud of myself and am hopeful that it’s getting easier!

I’ve been checking this subreddit regularly (obsessively lol) and PAWS experiences and it’s really kept me grounded, assured me that this was normal and that I’m going to be okay. I’ve been journaling daily, doing meditation, seeking out information about PAWS and I even attended an MA meeting online once. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I know there will be ups and downs still to come, but having the good days helps me keep strong.

My year anniversary of quitting will be this coming July 20th. Before quitting, my onset of usage was at about the age of 16. My use didn't become a problem until shortly after graduating high school. From the ages of 18 until almost 22, I allowed it to exert total control over my life through frequent use that only increased as the years wore on.

It's been a long journey since ceasing all use, one filled with much doubt and struggle. And of course, it's been absolutely worth the tribulations. I feel more like a whole person instead of a husk whose only purpose was to inhale the combustion of a psychedelic plant. I have interests again, I'm in college again, I'm reading, I feel amazing!

However, unfortunately, my mind still seems to be subtly impeded by the after-effects in a rather odd way that I haven't really seen discussed much in this sub. The main reason for me making this post is to try and ascertain if anyone else here has noticed a similar phenomena since ceasing all use.

I seem to struggle with verbal logic to a greater degree than I ever have before using. Using negation particles, or any form of negation grammar in any manner, especially in speech, seems to throw my understanding of what was said for a loop. This then causes me to feel like I've hardly understood the meaning of what was said, causing me to thereby replay the sentence in my mind over and over in an attempt to discern if I'm understanding the meaning. I'll then miss more of what was said by a person or by a character in a TV show which may prove more important to what was attempted at being put across, ultimately leaving me feeling terribly anxious and inadequate in my language abilities.

It's caused me a great deal of embarrassment when communicating with people, sometimes forcing me to clam up during a conversation due to my apprehension about the whole scenario.

If anyone else has experienced similar things please let me know. Maybe you have some insights into how to work around this interference in my stream of concentration, or some ways that I may be able to cope better rather than get visibly bothered by something so bizarre.

Thanks for reading! Above all else, keep trucking in your recovery! I know we can persevere.

Movie night? Smoke. Going clubbing? Smoke. Get back at 2 AM? Smoke. and then slowly all these things started disappearing until there was no rationalization left other than the truth. I’m scared.

I’m sure it’s just some withdrawal symptoms, but I’ve been *very* agitated, short-tempered, unable to concentrate, lethargic, etc. the past few days. Even feeling depressed and anxious. When I would smoke I would feel a bit lazy the night of, but not to the point where it interfered with any chores or anything. I would still clean my apartment and take care of things that needed to be done. 

Work has been miserable this week - brain fog, slow to think and react, forgetting things super easily. I felt sharper the days after I would smoke, interestingly enough.

Is this normal? Do I just need more time to adjust to not having it in my system?

I know 4 days isn’t much, and I have read through a lot of others’ experiences that says that it can take months to regulate after years of heavy use like mine. But right now, it doesn’t feel like things will every get better.

My body feels like it’s vibrating (if that makes sense?) and I feel a ton of pressure in my forehead. Headaches, shakiness like my nervous system is shot. The thought of food makes me ill.

Im 21 and have been smoking pretty much constantly since I was 14 with some months off here and there. I thought it would be impossible and I would just be one of those life long smokers which is something I do not want for myself. 

Once I got past those first couple days of craving it, it has became so much easier to resist that temptation. It probably also helped that I hid my stuff somewhere in my closet and made it hard to get to. Out of sight out of mind or whatever. In just this short time I feel so much more like myself again. Im funny again and can think better and Im more creative and I love that.

I have pretty bad depression and anxiety and recently went through a HUGE transition in my life, going to grad school getting an awesome and overwhelming research position and moving to a new state without any help. I would abuse weed like crazy to “make it better”, which Im sure some of yall can relate to. Turns out, weed was in fact making my natural mood regulators much less capable of actually handling stressors.
In all honesty after really stressful days like yesterday its really hard to control that urge to smoke. But I find its way easier to find something else to distract myself or make me feel better if Im not already high.


Anyway I just wanted to get this off my chest and express how much easier I find my everyday responsibilities and how much more like myself I feel even only a week in. Trying to keep up this point of view for as long as I can haha.

But if you zoom out and look at the bigger picture, its not one day or even one month of smoking that ruins your life. Its the slow but steady accumulation of wasting your potential, day in and day out.

If you do the math, in just one year of daily smoking your life gets roughly 37% worse(365×0.001=36.5%). Bad but not horrible. However by 3 years, you are more than a 100% worse off than you otherwise would have been. The math isn't what's important here, its the concept behind it . 

Its easy to see why my life and the lives of others has been so radically changed by what seemed to be a harmless decision in the moment. For 6 years I continued to make small errors in judgement that added up to a shitty life in the end. 
Eventually it got to the point where weed seemed to be the only thing making it bearable. Boy was I wrong. 

 
Now im on the path for good, however the path to a better life is just as slow as the one that got me here. Progress is slow. Be patient my friends. A better life awaits and no matter what, its worth it. 

 

Your mind will try and keep you stuck right where you are because its grown addicted to the comfort and easy access to what some of us came to believe is ""happiness"". Its not I promise you that. 


 
Start small and this will help you win in the long term. Maybe don't hit that friend back that just wants to smoke. Maybe just wait until after work. Eventually give it up all together. Once you do that, don't be too hard on yourself to live and act perfectly. Im nowhere near where I want to be and I have had my fair share of relapses.

Last night i smoked, and it sucked so bad. I put in about 6 days of no weed before my slip up last night. In what seemed like only a few minutes my thoughts shifted and I caved. After 2 very small bowls I experienced the worst anxiety/panic attack of my life. All of the sudden my heartbeat sped up and overwhelming doom filled my mind. Luckily my little sister who’s experienced many panic attacks was there. I couldnt stop crying/shaking/thinking. It was so terrifying. My fingers and hands began to  tingle, then became numb, and at one point i no longer could move my hands. I felt like a baby, and asked my sister to call our mom. She picked us up from my house, and luckily i was able to calm down within a few hours. 

Without any doubt, i believe this was a direct result of smoking. All was well, before those 2 bowls. It was so terrifying, scary, but mostly humbling.

I saw everyday I made the decision to roll up and smoke that spliff before going to bed ..I was slipping into a deep sleep.
I forgot myself in this sleep, I lost years, lost my health, picked up new habits that ruined me more, picked up fake friends and dropped real ones.
I started avoiding my moms call..I am a mamas boy never said anything to hurt her..well I cant say that anymore..I see disappointment in her eyes when she looks me smiling..them black lips and stained teeth..I never imagined myself until I really saw myself in mirror..I saw someone who I didnt recognize..I am lost how I ended up in this relation with miss mary jane..
This is not working out. I am leaving miss mary behind..up on my own ..will fight with my every might.
I smoked my last spliff today. 
Throwed all my stash and cigarettes
Came to dinner with my wife
Will buy nicotine patches and off I go away from this reefer smoke..

My eating habits have ironically turned to shit. 

I am SO HUNGRY all the time.  When I was smoking, I rarely wanted breakfast or even lunch for that matter.  I'd generally just have a big dinner and that would sustain my weight at a place where I liked it.  (Kind of like intermittent fasting).

But now I just want to eat all the time and I only crave super unhealthy food.  I saw a photo of myself yesterday that really spun me out because of how much bigger I looked.  I used to exercise a lot as well, but I've been dealing with a disc injury in my back that's taking months to repair.

This is probably the first time I've had a negative outlook on quitting, because keeping my body healthy is super important to me.  I used to be extremely overweight, and losing it all was a massive accomplishment for me.  Now it feels like I'm falling back into these old habits and that really scares me.

At the beginning of 2020 I made the decision to quit smoking after 7ish years of daily sun up to sun down usage. I had reached a point where everything felt real but didn't at the same time when I was sober. I was clean for over 8 months before I smoked again and then I did.

Smoking again for the first time after an extended break was great, I'll admit it was nice to get back to it and I felt like ""me"" again. It wasn't often and I didn't immediately return to a daily habit. I decided ""I'll just smoke socially."" And that's where it went downhill. A few weeks ago I was given a THC chocolate bar that was the perfect edible. Not too high not too low just enough to cruise. At the same time I was in a job I hated with a manager who wasn't happy unless we were all miserable. After getting that edible it went from taking a half a piece a night to relax, to a whole piece to relax, to two pices to relax and then I ran out and don't live in a state where I could get more. So I called my old dealer and bought a Q.

Yesterday I was sober and after work super cranky with my roommate and family over the phone and realized I'm back where I started, well almost back to where I started. I've been here before and I know how to get out of it. Take a bong rip. I was fine, smoked just one, played some video games and read a book and then woke up today.

I threw out all the bud, grinder and pieces I had re-accumulated over the past year a few minutes ago, I love smoking and I'll always love the times I had while smoking but I don't have control and it's a slow creap that becomes the most important thing in your life without you knowing it.

Moving forward it's time to say goodbye to the younger me, the one who used smoking as a blankie to keep me comfortable when life was hard or to celebrate when life was easy. I know it's going to take a few weeks to clean out my system and brain. At least this time I know how to deal with it and I know I've got y'all for support.

This thought just came to me and I wanted to share:

The ""good"" parts of weed that feel good? That's activating a brain system you already have in you. The cannabinoid system in your brain, normally, highlights information around you to make sure you know it's important and useful. Weed just deluges it more than you need.

So just keep in mind, when you quit, you will still feel happiness, and excitement, and bliss, and see things as beautiful and interesting, because your brain is ALREADY capable of it. :) I am on the other side of quitting and there has been so much beauty that has stimulated my brain: the sight of trees and sunlight outside, words on the pages of books I've read, the conversations I've had with my loved ones.

Promise you that weed isn't giving you anything you don't already have, and when you quit, and your brain becomes more sensitive again, the world will still excite and amaze you. Not all the time. But sometimes it will, and it will be worth it.

In these past three days I have been throwing up frequently and have had a really bad case of diarrhea.  I cant think straight and my stomach hurts non stop. 

My vomit is a yellow and white color and I haven't been able to eat much of anything since the day I quit. Sleeping is near impossible.

I've never felt withdrawals from weed until now I guess.

If anyone else has been through this, I would love some advice on how I can stop the pain.

Tldr: Bad withdrawal symptoms, please save my orifices.


Edit: I've been trying different things and I've found that hot baths and heating pads help a lot. Bland foods help a lot with the stomach pain. I think that I don't have an appetite but my stomach still needs food. (Duh)
This is for anyone who has the same problem and also doesn't know what to do.

Edit 2: A lot of awesome people have been messaging me with good advice so i thought I would share for posterity. Oregano, clover, cinnamon and black pepper are all Phytocannabinoids. They activate receptors that message your endocannabinoid system and can draw out withdrawal symptoms. So be careful with those. And drink Gatorade or Pedialyte as all the puking and pooping can wipe out your electrolytes which can leave you feeling really fucked up.

A little background.. 

I'm a 33 yr old female who was diagnosed as manic depressive (aka bipolar) at 19. I had my first major manic episode then that landed me in a hospital for several months. I also had started smoking pot that year and had decided to stop shortly after, which I believe triggered the mania. The mania consisted of insomnia, which then lead to hallucinations, thoughts of grandeur, hearing cheering in my head, etc. I concluded that unresolved childhood trauma, family stress, college demands and weed were the cause. 

So I laid off the pot for a few years. I started up again regularly around 22 after battling some mild depression. It wasn't legal where I lived and funds were tight so I was more of a 'smoke when its available' type (usually 3-5 times per week with friends). That changed when we moved to CO at 26. I soon became a daily user/loner stoner. Two years into daily usage, I decided to quit yet again. I had quit and decided to start studying for the CPA exam. This triggered yet another manic episode that damn near put me in the grave. I again blamed childhood trauma, stress and weed as the cause. Oh and demonic/spiritual warfare (whole different convo).

I didn't lay off pot this time though. I started consuming even more to fight the depression that inevitably comes after the manic highs. During all this time, I managed to thrive in my career and in my relationships. I got married a year after and had 2 back to back pregnancies. I was able to stop consuming while I was pregnant both times, Thank God. It was pretty easy to give it up during that time and I thought I was done for good but then came postpartum depression. I quickly started consuming again, and I stayed high all day every day, and loving it too! Weed energized me and made me a funner mom to my babies. Until I recently experienced my 3rd and final (in Jesus name!) manic episode earlier this year. Similar scenarios.. insomnia, childhood traumas resurface, high stress, demonic play and weed. 

Anyway, I'm convinced that marijuana does more harm to my mind than good. I relied on it for so long claiming it was my medicine (since I dont take any other meds regularly and only take mood stabilizers and sedatives during my manias). But after a decade+ of experimenting, I'm over it! Wonder if any of you guys can relate.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44043154}"

I quit because I have CHS and I’m going to be starting clinicals for nursing soon.

Anyway, I have been able to stay away from others smoking since then. Of course I smell it occasionally, that never really upset me, and of course some of my friends have smoked while we hung out, but I always just excused myself out of fear of being triggered. The smell really doesn’t bother me, it’s seeing others using that does.

Today I was a dumb dumb though, and sat in the same room as my partner who still smokes. I thought I could handle being around it, but I can’t. I’m craving so badly atm. I’m so envious that I can’t smoke, but everyone else can. I’m angry. I’m upset.

But truly, I love being sober. I’m so grateful for taking the plunge and living life with a clear mind. I traded weed for so many new opportunities, and I am so proud of myself.

I've never dealt with a level of workload like this before. The result has been a heightened level of anxiety that I've never really experienced before.

Naturally, I was medicating it with a bowl or two every night. Lately, however, the anxiety has started to trickle in during sessions because it's so mentally overbearing. Of course this doesn't mesh well with the high and I've begun giving myself panic attacks because the stressful work thoughts are extremely intrusive and elevate my heart rate. It's a very uncomfortable feeling.

Last night was the absolute worst. I went to bed early and tried to just sleep it off, but I ended up lying there doing useless breathing exercises to keep my heart rate down. I ended up having a mental breakdown in front of my wife.

There is just no way I can keep my anxiety under control anymore while also smoking daily. I need to be rooted in reality while I figure out how to manage it better. I'm hoping my job becomes a little less stressful once I have the hang of it but either way, weed is not doing good things for my anxiety. I attend therapy once a week and the anxiety relief strategies I'm learning just straight up aren't working. I blame the weed for a lot of that.

I know it's just not the way to go however I don't really know how to lessen the temptation.. I made my own food, took a shower and even exercised but it's not helping today. The fact that there is a coffeeshop 5minutes away from me isn't helping either, I am hoping that creating this post will make me conscious that the real treat would be making it another day. The shops close down in about 2.5 hours so I am hoping to make it through to then  🙏

I took a three week break the first three weeks of this past May and was feeling great then relapsed. Well last weekend my wife said she was not happy and wanted to split after 12 years and two kids. Because I know what weed has done to me and my personality, I pretty much knew why she felt that way but it still feels like a surprise. 

Weed has made me lazy, unproductive, unmotivated, forgetful, dull, depressed, and most of all a bad husband and partner. I don’t express my feelings and show that I love her or do anything to support her. I started piecing all of this together back in late 2018 after a head injury that really changed the way I think every day since then but I kept smoking as a way to cope with my “new” mental status an an anxiety-ridden basket case. The head trauma truly changed me more and in different ways that the weed did. I am far more emotional than ever before, extremely insecure, and full of anxiety which is the opposite of how I was prior. But it did make me at least aware of what weed was doing to me. I am once again quitting weed after this past weekend with my wife, and I am praying I can regain control of my life and my marriage. I know that it will get better, my “T break” last month proved that. I just hope it’s not too late. 

People were right all along to consider weed a drug and call it “bad” like all the rest. Only they did so for all the wrong reasons. Weed is like mental abuse that you just get used to. And it will, given time, destroy you and the things you hold most dear. It will destroy your mental well being and replace “you” with a shadow of your old self. Weed is dangerous and should be treated as such. There are many good, medicinal uses for it, but unless you have one of those ailments, then smoking weed is truly just drug abuse. Especially smoking the weed we have available today with the amped up THC that does nothing but throw off your brains chemical balance. It takes time to repair that balance after you quit. I hope she grants me the chance to try again and try to find my old self.

I've been in this subreddit for a couple months now (this is a throwaway account don't want people I know seeing this) and I was motivated enough to quit that I tried back in about march and I lasted 20 days when I foolishly said yes to an invite to smoke because it was this girl I was into.

Granted I have been a bit more productive since then but I need to quit. Not just for my productivity, but for my weight (the munchies always get to me) and I have clear goals for my life which I will probably not be able to pursue to the degree that I need to due to this stupid green plant.

I'm on my 5th week, feeling extremely good as I strive to be the best version of myself. For context I've been using weed since I was 14 to 18 stopped until I was 28 and continued using into my 30s. As many of you have already described, the feeling being liberated from weed is really something else. You realise how beautiful life is and how weed, at first feels like it enhances it, but really it sucks the life out of you. 

I think the key to being sober is understanding why you did the weed in the first place. People do it to escape etc,  knowing why you do it in the first place definitely helps. 

I now exercise 3 times a week, went from 80kgs to 76kgs, from cutting sugary foods from the relentless midnight munchies to fizzy drinks to being super active. 

Those that struggle to sleep in the first few weeks, I would encourage you to run, jog partake in some form of exercise. This should help with the sleeping!

I hope this helps some of you, there's always a new day to start fresh so never feel trapped. Keep it step by step, Rome wasn't built in a day!

Longest so far,"this is the longest ive been sober after getting high everyday for a little over 10 yrs. ive taken a few breaks for a couple days to a week but never this long. i hope this is the real deal!

allow me to share my experience since ive stopped:

first three days were TOUGH. 
cravings were very real and trying to sleep was difficult. appetite went down and made me easily lose weight that i didnt want to. not to mention the wild and crazy vivid dreams every night (which i didnt mind all that much, but some dreams got a lil too weird lol). also mood swings, from feeling like a bitch to hating everything

a little after a week everything toned down. my cravings are def not as bad anymore unless im hella bored out my mind. i still get vivid dreams every night but they arent as wild anymore. my appetite seems to be stabilized now and trying to fall asleep comes more naturally. 

some more pros:
waking up early is easier and with a whole lot less brain fog. ive been feeling more productive, making me want to take care of things ive been putting off. anxiety is super decreased and generally more confident with being in public, around strangers and things like that. that shell of myself feeling seems to be minimal now. i still get moody and minor depression sometimes where before id take a few hits to take the edge off but now im able to power thru it by recognizing it and trying to keep my mind occupied. 

believe me and others when they say it gets easier over time, but i still do think about taking a hit off my pen all the time. i miss grubbing out on delicious food, feeling super relaxed after exercising, socializing w the stoner homies, getting high and thinking about stuff in my life from a different 'stoned' perspective. but then i remind myself why i stopped. i want to further progress my life instead of coasting thru it being addicted to weed; it almost feels like my life was stagnant and sometimes it still feels that way. but i know thay one great step to break out of that is to sober up first bc i was FORSURE ADDICTED. 

i dont drink or have any other mind altering habits so staying sober is only by getting off da trees but i noticed i do hit my niccotine vape a lot more since ive stopped weed, but thatll be my next challenge. 

i want to thank this community for sharing their stories which are always very encouraging, and hopefully mine can help others too in their quitting journey. my journey is not over and i still have a long way to go.

I have been a heavy weed smoker for about 8 years. Though I am currently 6 months sober. The longest I have been sober was 1 year and after that I went back to smoking like a chimney. 

&#x200B;

I am currently 6 months sober and I feel the most bored I have felt in my entire life. I am doing a lot better than I was 6-7 months ago but I feel absolutely nothing. I don't feel anything at all. I am much healthier though. I had a lot of trouble breathing, I was a chop bong smoker for years. I can breathe much better now and I have only just stopped coughing up brown mucus balls. 

What i'm actually asking here is how do I cope/get past this boredom without smoking weed? I don't want to go back to smoking. It's been 6 months and I still don't feel sober. My brain is STILL foggy. 

&#x200B;

This is going to sound weird but the more sober I get the shittier I am becoming. I am not advocating for smoking weed but why do I feel like this/ why am I like this? I feel like a much better person when I smoke weed... When I am sober I get into arrogant states that I don't like. 

I feel like weed has sort of messed up my natural ""flow"".... It seems that non stoners have a sort of ""flow"" in life that works for them. I don't have this in any sense. Every problem is so huge and bold like a 20 ft wall I need to jump over. Tbh I feel like i want the bliss like state that weed brings on but I want it naturally, I just want comfort and not having to work too hard but I need to work hard to get there. 

&#x200B;

I feel like I need money, a comfortable place, no obligations and various investments to get there but then its still boring. I wish I'd never tried weed. The pull of weed is so strong for me. I've always been a bit of an outsider and weed kind of made me feel comfortable with that. I wish I could go back and never smoke it.

2021-06-22 00:14:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/o5e2d4/thought_id_share_my_story/,Thought I'd share my story," This is my first time posting on reddit, apologies for the long-windedness. TL:DR on-off stoner family man relapses and kicks the habit on the same day.

I had occasionally smoked, maybe once a month for years, but because of my lack of contacts it never became regular. I developed a habit in my late twenties during the last months of uni in 2014, after having discovered silk road and such sites. After graduation my then gf and now wife moved in together and rather insidiously my habit worsened as the months passed. Now, my wife drinks maybe five glasses of wine a year and is pretty much zero-tolerance when it comes to other intoxicants, so maybe you can see the potential for conflict.

After 2014 I'd buy weed online on the regular and spend the next maybe three years living the cycle of being ecstatic when the bag arrived in the mail and and anxious when I was running out. I'd have weeks off in between but eventually I'd crave it too much and place an order.

This lifestyle, combined with a somewhat demanding day job and a sober gf made for some ridiculous acrobatics I'd pull. I'd listen to my gf's breathing to tell when she fell asleep and sneak to the other room to vape, staying up until 1-2 am regularly on weekdays (I'd figure out all the tricks to do this very quietly). I'd find an excuse to go to the supermarket, pack the vape and hastily drag puffs walking there. I'd get home from work as soon as I could so I could vape before my gf got home. It was not pretty and soon I noticed the enjoyment was almost totally gone, with maybe fifteen minutes of relaxation after toking and then just boredom.

I got caught multiple times and swore to her and myself I'd stop, but even as I was doing so I could feel the dishonesty in my words and soon I'd resume, convinced I wouldn't get caught this time.

Then my gf got pregnant and we got married. If vaped irregularly during the early pregnancy but managed to stop it and for the first year with our child I didn't use weed at all. To my shame, somewhere in the summer of 2018 I caved and bought some weed, this time smoking joints.

My next time getting caught was as red-handed as they come. In september 2018 I was on a business trip to another town and had a few beers with colleagues in the evening. Like a true addict, being away from home I had pre-rolled a joint and couldn't wait to get to smoke it alone. I did, and afterwards was having a whatsapp-conversation with an old stoner friend, at the same time juggling another conversation with my wife. Drunk and high as I was I couldn't not advertise my intoxication to my friend and owing to my mental state I accidentally sent the message to my wife. Realizing what I'd just done was not a pleasant feeling. Long story short, the next morning on my way to the train I threw the weed in the thrash and haven't had a smoke since.

Until yesterday. The desire to smoke crept up on me with the warm weather, and to celebrate the start of my summer holiday I rather spontaneously set up a deal. My wife is still working so the situation was ideal. But almost instantly after smoking, instead of elation I felt guilt. I felt like an addict, a liar, a coward. I could see where the path I was about to step on would lead. Maybe on special occasions like this at first. But then, hey, friday evening's a special occasion, right? What about a hasty trip to the supermarket on a gloomy november tuesday, that's pretty special, right? The lies, the secrets, the mental energy wasted on keeping said secrets. I could already see myself arranging my life around those precious moments of lighting up.

I felt this would be the moment to be an adult, a husband, a father. To overcome base urges with willpower. Respond to duty. Somehow, despite being high off a decent-sized joint after a couple years off I worked up some mental fortitude and threw the 5 g (about .2 ounces) of weed I had into the thrash on my way home. One small step for man, one giant leap for man.

After coming home I looked myself in the mirror and felt pride. A very small suburban battle was won yesterday. The urge to smoke is still there and will rise it's head again. It doesn't have to be obeyed.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47625822}"

I cried so much and felt weak, broken, something was wrong with me and the world around me and weed would make it right, just one smoke would make it right, I had to say no even though I didn't want to, I didn't think I was strong enough, but I reached out to support and it carried me through to today which is feeling easier than yesterday. I actually already feel a bit of motivation coming back, or maybe im just motivated to distract myself.

I listened to music, meditations, excersised, drank tea and coffee and had some nicotine replacement instead of a cigarette because cigarettes trigger me to want weed not just tobacco. Also did some research on what is actually occurring in my brain with the dopamine receptors.

I haven't eaten anything but a lil fruit before bed, wanting to enjoy food is a bit of a trigger, like right now its the morning of day 2 and I would love to have a smoke and go cook myself a bacon sandwich, but I just gotta persevere and persist. Weed is the easy choice for me and nothing will change in my life if I keep making the easy choice.

Im taking some supplements that hopefully support me in re wiring my brain to enjoy life without being high.

I forgotten how to enjoy my life sober.

I had this belief that I need weed, I need to be high to feel myself, to feel happiness. The belief is slowly going.

I actually feel free now, weed had control of me, not quite myself but im taking it day by day and I know that if I stick to this choice I am going to be in a position to improve my life and achieve the goals I have been thinking and talking about for too long.

feel free to reach out, support was a big key for me yesterday on day 1 and will continue to be, so if anyone wants a quit buddy hmu",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48471418}"

I’ve lurked a while trying to convince myself through your stories to quit. I see so much of myself in many of the stories you post. First, thanks for sharing and showing me the perspectives.

Now about me... as I type this I’m crafting a lie to tell my girlfriend about all of the weed I smoked. All of HER weed. About $200 worth of wax, I smoked it in 2 weeks. For a while now I’ve been saying “oh gosh it affects me so bad, I just need to quit” but then I go back to my old habits. My girlfriend got to a point where in order for me to not smoke it all, she has to hide her stash every day before work. She doesn’t know that I found her hiding spot about 2 weeks ago and I’ve slowly been picking away. Past me said “ah we will worry about this later, have a smoke now!”

Here we are, and it’s later. I’ve now convinced my brother to help cover for me and say that it was one of his friends...

This has made me realize just how badly I am trying to cling to this addiction. I’m willing to do anything and lie to the love of my life. We had an incident a while ago where I took her stash too, so I know this would be her last straw. I cant lose her.

I’m scared to death to face the world without the drug I’ve been abusing for over 3 years now, but something has got to give.  I can’t continue like this, all I’m doing is being self destructive. I don’t know how to start except for to take it one step at a time.

Posting milestones often elicits questions from members about the key factors in success of quitting. I'd like to share what it took for me to succeed. Everyone is different and we also share similarities. If sharing my experience helps someone it will have been worthwhile. The two biggest factors for me were **fear** and **acceptance.**

**Fear**Fear was the biggest thing that held me back from making lasting and meaningful changes to my life. There was a lot of fear involved in my quitting. I feared a future life of being sober. I hadn't learned how to cope with anything without weed. I feared learning how to do life again - without weed. I resolved to take things one day at a time, learning to cope as I went along with whatever life threw at me.

In my mind weed made me ""special"", gave me an advantage other people didn't have. Over the years I had convinced myself this was true. I feared losing this advantage. Lots of introspection and rational thinking changed my mind on this view. Weed didn't make me special or give me an advantage - the reality is it was quite the opposite of that.

I feared losing part of my identity. I read, watched and consumed a lot of weed related content. I considered myself an expert in the subject, and I guess I was compared to the average joe. I grew weed and took pride in being self-sufficient in supplying myself with drugs. My approach to overcoming this was to explore new hobbies, engage in new and interesting things, improve in hobbies I was already doing and appreciate all the time not having weed in my life would free up.

There were other fears but those were the biggest of the bunch and each needed a plan for me to cope with along the way. I put a lot of effort into changing the way I viewed life and my relationship with weed and the acknowledging impact weed really had on my life.

**Acceptance**

With my life revolving around weed and having had previously resigned to the fact that it was just part of my life there were a lot of new realities I had to accept.

I had to accept and be okay with approaching life sober. I accepted that along the way I would have cravings or feel discomfort in a lot of various ways. I needed to accept that things would be tough and there would be a lot of challenges to overcome if I wanted to change my life.

I had to accept that while I really did want change and that was my ultimate goal there would be other parts of my ""self"" trying to convince me to go back to weed. There would be lots of scenarios, circumstances, cues and triggers that would activate the parts of me that I had conditioned to use weed over all those years. I had to accept that I would encounter these and that I needed to then direct my thoughts back to my ultimate goal of making a lasting and meaningful change to my life.

I had enough knowledge to know that things were going to get worse before they got better. Things weren't going to change overnight, or in weeks. Recovering from weed, given my long term history, was going to take months and maybe even years. I had to be okay with that, I had to accept that the changes I wanted were going to take a long time and that in order to succeed I would have to sacrifice comfort and familiarity to see it through.

Quitting weed for me took a lot of work, it was one of the greatest challenges of my life, it took an enormous amount of time and a lot of committment and resolve to stick to what I knew would get me where I really wanted to go and not taking short cuts or making excuses to allow myself to relapse. I accepted that any amount of weed at this point would set me on course back to full-blown addiction. I had to accept that my life would no longer include any of the (diminishing) positive benefits I got from weed.",214,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.50934887}"

This sub has helped me alot over the past few months as I was struggling to quit. Recently my mom, who has known about my usage, changed her attitude towards me and actually gave me money to go and buy some weed because she could see that I can't function without it. 

When that happened, I felt so ashamed that she had kinda given up on me. Like she just wanted me to somehow focus on my studies, even if it meant being in a daze whilst doing so. It made me realise how far my addiction had gone. I was a heavy user for 8 years but it took this one action from my mom to make me realise how bad it had gotten. 

I felt really strong urges yesterday and even called my dealer, but he told me to wait two days which postponed my urges and helped me get through. I'm feeling perfect right now and I'm kinda staving the urges with cigarettes but I know I'm gonna have more urges later in the day so I hope I can cope with them. 

I saw a video on line that said days 5-7 are the ones where alot of marijuana dependant users relapse so I'll try my best not to go back. Weed had crippled me socially and psychologically so I know for a fact I'm doing better without it, but the cravings are still there and it's hard. 

I'm gonna keep this new account here as a way to look back and keep monitoring my urges, but for now I'm on day 5 and I'm really hoping I don't go back!! 

Thanks to everyone who posts here and share their experiences! It helps alot and I've been reading this sub daily for a few months now.

Starting at day one again, doing it for my kids and I","I need to be accountable and telling all of you will help. I love to read all of your stories, you are all great people, thanks. Here is my story update: 

 I smoked heavily daily since Sophomore year '96'  until Feb 2020. 24 years!!!! I had some times in the Army and college when I couldn't smoke but they were short breaks for deployments, pee tests or exams.

I did quit right before Covid shut everything down last March. I was strong and stayed sober while working from home. I couldn't believe that I stayed sober and thrived throughout the 2nd craziest anxiety riddled year of my life. (Iraq war being #1). I studied and passed my architect license exams, quit my job and started my own firm. I was in great shape physically and most important mentally. Things were going splendid!

I was about ten months clean when I went with my stoner friends on new years weekend for an all expenses paid steelhead fishing trip. I submitted to the peer pressure in the car ride and took a couple small hits, got stoned and it was fun. I thought I could return to be sober after that weekend. Wrong! The thoughts of smoking started coming on hard when I got home. I caved after a few days and got the ol bong and very small stash of old stale weed out.  I regretted it immediately after it was smoked, and I wish now I would have thrown it out in February. I smoked it all and then when it was done after a couple days I had to go get some fresh bud and give that a go. So after smoking that gram, I went back for more and got edibles, a pen and a quarter. Here we go again. 

Not gonna lie, that first month or two was fun, made me feel like a teenager discovering weed again. Then not long after the tolerance went up and it became an everyday all day thing to maintain that numb feeling. My kids (5&9), wife, mom, family and friends noticed I was back at it even though I tried my best to hide it. 

Here are some things that happened since staring smoking again:
That stinky smell sticks to your fingers, your face, your clothes, your breath and it is life altering if you dont want to smell like pot. Washing hands, showering, brushing teeth way more frequently.
My new business has been suffering with my lack of ambition, social skills degrade to the point you avoid the calls and emails, which is not good to say the least for a new business!
Relationship problems with my family are worse with grumpiness when I am not high and lack of communication with them and just being stupid high around them.
Self confidence has gone way down (always disappointed with myself after smoking and all the effects of the addiction)
Anxiety goes up and I don't address it, just temp suppress it,
Diet has gone to shit (constant munchies), less self control and I am exercising way less, 
Altering my daily/ weekly schedule around getting to the pot shop and getting high, plus all the money I spend there.
Sleep is not nearly as good, I really miss the REM state Vivid dreams (might be the best part of being sober!)
The worst is the disappointment from my oldest daughter and wife. You can see the disappointment and it's a killer.

So today I threw out my pens and weed paraphernalia and had a great day with my kids sober. While silently dealing with my withdrawals, they celebrated me for Father's Day and we enjoyed our day together.
Hoping my sleep will be good tonight and I have a good start to a new sober life. This has been so difficult to do I tried many times the past couple months but I couldn't get through one day. I will do it this time, for ME and everyone that I come in contact with. They like sober me better and so do I! 
So today and tomorrow I won't get high with you.

Anyway I’ll list benefits from most interesting to least. 

-IQ increased by a significant amount. I’m not going to share what my IQ is but I took a test a year ago and one last week and I scored a LOT higher on the one I took when I was 8 months sober. No kidding right. I took the test sober both times but the first time I smoked every afternoon and second test clean for 8 months. Just think of all the potential you have that you’re not accessing because weed clouds your processing. 

-Pain tolerance increased. I think this has to do with Mary Jane causing anxiety so now that I’m sober I don’t think about the pain and it literally hurts 1/10th of what it hurt before when my mind was a mess because of weed. Noticed this when I burned my hand pretty badly and when I took a hard fall skateboarding, both events didn’t hurt nearly as much as before(they happen like every 6 months lol)

-More secure in myself and what I want out of life. Not happy? Why? Can you change it? Yes? Okay, little by little work to improve your situation. Can’t change it? Leave it to God and focus on something you can change. 

-Digestion is better and body feels good. It’s becoming clearer that gut health is paramount to mental health and smoking weed everyday, you’re probably too tired to make nutritious food so takeout it is. Terrible for your mind and body. One of the first things that hits you like a train when you quit is how shitty you feel. That’s your body telling you it’s starving for nutrients after years of neglect, you will feel better once you fix this. 

That’s all I can think of for now, if you notice any improvements in yourself id

As the initial euphoria of change wares off , all I am left with is the regret of lost time.

I think about all the people I’ve strung along the way:

The girls who wanted to be around me

The friends who wanted to hangout with me

The family who enjoyed my company 

Every important person in my life has been a victim to the compulsive lies I’ve lead to enjoy the time spent alone with my mind and addiction. I remember thinking that they’d always be there for when I eventually chose to leave the hole I dug-until they’re not. 

Girls leave for guys who will pay attention to them

Friends chase their own goals ; find love and eventually grow too busy for your new found friendship desire

And most importantly family grows old, distant and eventually die

When you eventually emerge from your own selfish desire , you may realize that you’re alone and the world doesn’t cater to you. That the wasted time getting high stripped you of precious years of love and life.

To all who read this, I only wish for you to make the changes to enjoy the life you should be living. Get out there and enjoy your life because at the end of it all you just might find that the world passed you by.

Things have gotten a lot easier from the first two weeks. I was initially having so much trouble sleeping, eating, with anxiety, brain fog, a lot of issues really. Now I can say I feel a lot better. I quit drinking alcohol a year ago, stopped smoking weed two months ago, and I stopped watching porn a month ago. After about a month sober from weed I noticed I was filling in the gaps with too much technology and it became apparent to me I was trying to escape the feelings of boredom/anxiety/stress by using technology/porn. I found that as soon as I was able to recognize my technology use for what it was, it was a lot easier to quit than ever before. I think that's from the will power I gained from quitting weed. I'm a lot more productive now and a lot more stable.

I learned a lot about myself from quitting weed. For me, alcohol wasn't as hard because the negative effects were a lot easier to feel. I started practicing meditation a lot more seriously and I feel like I can really slow down and see my thoughts for what they are now. My diet has been on point and I've been working out 3-4x a week. I lost a few pounds the first few weeks of not smoking but now my appetite is back with a vengeance. Sometimes, if I'm really bored I catch my mind thinking that I want to smoke weed but I know it's just a temporary fix. Things are on the up and up, I'm working towards switching into a new career and I've made a lot of progress on doing that.

Since rooting out alcohol/weed/porn it's become obvious to me when I start getting too carried away with something. Now I'm realizing that I use my smartphone too much and sometimes I procrastinate by watching entertaining videos or reading on what's happening in the world. Far too much time. 

It feels so crazy since I smoked weed for 12 years. Time has been moving so slow ever since, I don't know how to explain it. It feels like I have more time than I ever had before. These last two months have felt like the passage of 2 years time when I used to be high 24/7. It's really nice. I'm a lot more empathetic, I listen better, I'm wayyyy more patient. Being a pothead I used to get road rage but I feel so zen like all the time. I'm sure it's a combination of letting go of the wrong things and introducing new things. 

So if you're just starting out on this journey I want to tell you - things will get better. They definitely will. You need to add new habits when you take the bad ones away and you need to be patient with yourself. It's going to take time and everyone's journey is different. Ultimately, you'll make it from one shore to the other no matter how crazy or far the swim seems. Take things one day at a time. I really wish you all the best of luck and I look forward to coming back here next month to leave another update. I really can't believe I did it. This is the longest I've ever been sober ever. No caffeine, no sugar, no porn, no alcohol, and no weed. I feel free, I feel light. You'll get that feeling too, you just have to want it bad enough and stick to your word.

Hi everyone, this is my first post after being a lurker for a bit. I’m currently on Day 5 off carts after smoking solidly since 2018. I realized I needed to quit once I looked at all my empty carts staring back at me. Another big reason is I can’t do anything anymore without being high or I’m anxious as hell. I have had anxiety and depression my whole life and I was told by doctors, friends, and family that weed really was the way to go. And they were right for a bit! All my problems seemed easier, past traumas didn’t haunt me on a daily basis, etc. It especially got out of hand during the Pandemic where all I would do is play video games, smoke, and isolate from everyone. Moving forward, Day 5 sucks. A lot. I woke up with an extreme panic attack and even after trying to ride it out, it became too overwhelming and I took some otc sleep stuff to ease the mental and physical symptoms. I’m achey, I have hot and cold sweats, and I have absolutely zero appetite (which is bad because I struggle from disordered eating too). Any advice out there?

But I’m 24 days sober now and can’t stop crying. I’m so depressed and lethargic and moody. I feel useless in my creative advertising job, and raised my voice at my boss on Friday when she called me out for literally not having any ideas. I was hoping that quitting would allow me to get up, get outside, be motivated… and I feel like I don’t even have the energy to get out of bed the way I used to.

What am I missing here? I was a heavy smoker for like 20 years so I understand that it could take a while to feel “normal” but I’m not even sure what that is? I feel like my usually creative, positive brain has just stopped working, and I’m worried that I won’t get that back. I play a couple of instruments and can’t find the motivation to play at all, let alone with any passion or musicality. I just stare at my bookshelves but can’t make myself care about reading something. 

Are there some of you that dealt with a longer than usual withdrawal? How did you know when you were feeling better? It’s clear from this sub that quitting is the right decision when there’s a dependence (and I know I was dependent), but what exactly should I be expecting in terms of this better life on the other side? What does the better life look like? 

I do deal with depression and am on medication for it, but it’s never been this unbearable. I’m female if that matters from a body chemistry perspective. Thanks for any help.",13,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8292315}"

2021-06-20 10:59:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/o47izj/tips_that_made_withdrawal_suck_less_for_me/,Tips that made withdrawal suck less for me:,"-Avoid the environment you normally smoke in. Or being around other stoners. If possible, spend time out of the house and distract yourself as much as you can. If not possible to leave your smoking environment, try rearranging furniture and hiding/getting rid of any smoking paraphilia. Get some fresh flowers or something and open the curtains. 

-Do something that you have been putting off. If you're a stoner you likely have a few things lol. You're going to feel like shit anyway so may as well clean the house! Or wash the car, or mow the lawn etc 

-Tell your loved ones what you're doing and how you feel. They will be more understanding of your irritability and might be able to help distract you. It also makes the decision not to smoke more concrete.  If you don't have anyone understanding to talk to about it come on here or DM me xx

-Eat healthier, fresher food. Idk about y'all but I always get a little backed up (constipated) when I tried to quit multiple times in the past hah. I couldn't really stomach much besides some toast and salad the first few days. Some fresh fruit is good too. Some plain mash potato or rice can help with the bowel movements. 

-Write a list of things that you have to look forward to (literally or mentally). Will you be able to buy that thing you always wanted with the money saved? Will it be easier to go jogging? Your skin and hair will look a lot shinier and healthier. You will become objectively smarter. Your sex drive will come back. You will smell better. 

-Force yourself to do fun stuff that you normally couldn't do because you were too high. Read a good book. Try a new hobby. Do something creative. Go visit that non smoker friend that you never have time for. 

-Do something that makes you feel useful to others/society. Volunteer work, help out an elderly neighbour etc. 

I got more politically informed (be careful with this though! I know it's not for everyone). I used to smoke to numb some of my anxiety about the future and the way strangers and people I love get treated by those with power. I realise I'm not as useful to any causes I care about while my mind is foggy and I'm just trying to numb the pain. I read more now and I'm more informed on issues that matter to me. I've since found myself being able to convince family members to be less xenophobic. I feel more hopeful about the future because I feel like I have more control. I understand now that my inability to be a ""functional"" member of society was not entirely my fault. I think I've become a more empathic person and less nihilistic. 

-Lastly, be kind to yourself. Be proud of yourself. This world is fucked up sometimes and unfair. There is nothing wrong with you and you've done nothing wrong by smoking in the past. It was a fun experience but now you're making a good, pragmatic decision in regards to you physical, mental, and financial health. It's never too late. Take things day by day. 

This is just something that you need to do and will make you healthier in the long run. A few days to a month is a short time compared to a lifetime of smoking and regretting it/self loathing.

In that gap year I started smoking a lot more weed; although I occasionally smoked with friends, I did not smoke alone (before the gap year). Fast forward to 2021, where in January I was doing well with quitting weed, however around week 3 I caved in, which sucks since I didn't even enjoy smoking at that time. For some reason however, I rolled another one and that one did hit better and from there it all went downhill; I was smoking more than a gram a day again.

This past week I limited my weed use to one joint a day and yesterday I finally pulled the trigger of trying to quit weed again, after seeing this subreddit. It was a really hard day, especially since I went to hang out with friends in the evening and one person wanted to smoke a joint with me, however I could restrain myself luckily. I know that it all gets better after a few weeks, however I still can't deal with the fact that the thought of weed will still be in my head for a while. Also, I know it's gonna get worse in the upcoming days especially and yesterday already was an emotional rollercoaster for me.

Coming back to the point of university, my intrinsic motivation has always been pretty bad but after smoking weed it reached it's lowest of lows, which led to me having to resit 5 courses the upcoming weeks. It's not all bad since I can also resit some next year, but the fact that I let it come this far for two years in a row just sucks a lot. I am really hoping to fix my intrinsic motivation, eating habits and in general get back to the old me, as I just feel bad for my girlfriend aswell, who has had to deal with my weed addiction, and now has to deal with me feeling depressed in these upcoming weeks. I am confident posting this will help me stay committed and reach the goal of being sober.

Found a good job, which motivated me to moderate my use during the week. Weekends are still one big hazy mess tho.

And that is why I'm here. I know quiting this shit is important for my happiness, for my health, my wallet and my friend- and relationships. Even tho I'm a ""functional addict"", it's still holding me back so much.  

So I threw away what I had left. And I'm going for that 90 days. Not with the intention of starting again after that time-frame, but to make it an achievable goal.

Today marks one whole year of being sober which feels amazing. I have no desire to smoke anymore and I feel more free than ever. I do still drink occassionaly but I never had any problem with alcohol and it hasn't affected other aspects of my life.

One year ago, I was on the verge of dropping out of college, put myself and others in danger every other day by driving high(still never drove after drinking but never thought driving high was any risk back then), had growing strains in my relationships etc. Now I am doing great in college, my relationships couldn't be better and I just feel so much better.

First couple of months it was hard. I wasn't as regular of a smoker as most of the people on this sub were. I smoked every 2-3 days on average, but some weeks it was also couple of times a day. This was mostly due to the availability of weed in my place of living, if it was higher I would have smoked much more often for sure. Even so, it started affecting me badly and I just decided to stop cold turkey, once and for all. I kept telling myself it's okay, I just need to kick the habit but in the future it would be okay to smoke once in a while, but now the thought of smoking just kinda disgusts me. I never liked the actual smoking part, just the high I got from it, so when I realized I am doing fine without the high, the whole ordeal just has no appeal to me anymore.

I still hang out often with my group of friends who smoke regularly, but it doesn't bother me. It did the first few months but I decided to limit my interactions with them during that time, not that they didn't understand but I just didn't want to be anywhere near weed. Now that I am stable I can sit next to them and chat while they smoke without feeling any temptation, which also makes me feel pretty empowered and further proves to myself that I really don't need weed in my life.

To anyone reading this that hasn't still made the final step towards quitting, I say just do it, and do it NOW. It is one of the single best decisions I have made in my life, and it has affected my life in the best way possible. The first couple of months will be hard for sure, but you need to stay strong, find someone to talk to about it and/or make a list of reasons why you quit and put it on your homescreen to remind you in times of weakness. You can do it, anyone can, so stop putting it off, dump your weed, grinders, rolling papers etc and do it NOW, not tomorrow. Good luck and thank you all for sharing your experiences.

I understand getting a chip and that applause at 30 days, 6 months, a year, etc.. can be encouraging for many people in recovery. However I think as time really starts to build, clean time can become a part of your identity. I remember seeing people in 12 step meetings with 20, 30, 40, even 50 years clean when I was new to AA and looking at them like gods on earth. I know for me as my years started to add up my ego built up along side it.

At around 8 years sober it dawned on me that I never entered into recovery to accumulate time. Somewhere along the way it became a goal to build years and die with 50+ years sober, never drinking again. When I first got into recovery I didn't even want to quit drugs long term, I just wanted a life worth living. 

I've known several people who have relapsed and killed themselves shortly after. The guilt and shame becomes unbearable when you realized you failed yourself and feel like you've failed others. Resetting your sober date after years feels like a waste if you're just going to have one time drunk or high. Might as well take advantage before you gotta go back and raise your hand as a newcomer. And if you do slip, the embarrassment of announcing yourself a newcomer is enough for some people to lie for years about their sobriety.

I'm happy to report that I've reached my goal of one week, cold turkey, without weed. I've noticed my depression eroding away, less intrusive negative thoughts, and (following a few difficult nights) more normalized sleep patterns.

The urge is still there, and some evenings are harder than others. In those instances I've found it best to change my environment before the prompt for the habit I've built becomes too strong to resist. Getting out of my room, going for a drive, sitting in common spaces in my home to interact with roommates, etc. Having a clearer mind has made it easier to detect these moments of weakness and act on them. 

Cheers all. Know that there are people rooting for you, and resources to help. You don't have to go at this alone, and you are not a failure if you slip up. We only fail when we quit trying.

2021-06-19 14:37:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/o3mrtp/0_benefits_of_being_stoned/,0 benefits of being stoned,"Hi there, already posted few here on why and how I quit weed almost two years ago (late 2019). I’m talking about my personal experience, and the feedback of my entourage. I’ve noticed people who trynna quit usually seek for excuses to not give up on weed. The addiction is kicking when you think you can’t live without it. You won’t appreciate your music, the social life without being stoned when in facts there’s no benefits at all. First of all, even if you think you’re stealthy, you’re not. Everyone knows you’re high if the smell is not a sufficient proof your face is 😶‍🌫️🥴, your attitude too. People are just polite enough for not bringing the touchy subject in. But most and foremost when you’re high you’re weak as fuck and not ready for whatever. I used to smoke in my backyard of our building. Everyone knew about that, but my neighbors were cool enough (I live in France where it’s forbidden so that was very heartwarming to see old folks or parents being nice to me about it). Had a new neighbor in 2018. Young doctor, nice car beautiful wife but idk something felt off with him, the way he looks the way he talks. From time to time he saw me smoking but didn’t care at all. One day I was smoking in the backyard, high as fuck, and playing with my cat 🙃😸 he opened the door like a swat officer yelling about how the smell was unbearable for him and then pretending he wondered who the fuck was smoking for days (even if he saw me smoking on multiple occasion). 
Told me to go smoke outside (meaning in the street), so I nonchalantly told him « we’re already outside bruh 😏 », he was pissed off, then told me he won’t accept people smoking in his place, so I responded that’s not his place he’s just paying rent whereas I own my fuckin place (ok listen, I’m arrogant can’t help it but I was super high so him looking furious, teeth grinding, fists clenching and the swagger are the cues I should have noticed but I was too high to make such analysis). What happened next was obvious he beat the shit out of me with not a single reaction coming from me. Got helped by another neighbor who saw the scene. Short version, i quit weed in between. 6/7 months later he tried to assault me for no reason. Me sober, he didn’t stand a chance against me. I fucked him up. Charges were pressed on both sides. His only defense was me being a junkie, justice is slow in France so by the time we went to court not a single thc trace or any drugs were in my system. Witness made me win the case, crazy neighbor eventually moved. 
As I said, zero benefits of being high, you’re useless to yourself and the one you care about. You’re not danger ready, the lack of reaction can be fatal if you have kids. When we started weed none of us had the dream of becoming a furniture lmao but in the end even furnitures are more useful than high people. Energy and money drained, zero dignity, zero motivation, danger management non existent. ZERO BENEFITS",231,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46335065}"

I picked up my old cheap fishing rod and I’ve been going fishing almost every day now. There’s a pond a few minutes from my house with a lot of bass, and I’m nearby several lakes and other ponds with great spots to sit by the water. I actually look forward to waking up so I can fish some more, and it’s so cheap! It costs me like $5 a week for hours and hours of fun on the water, all I need is hot dogs and the occasional new pack of hooks and lures. On top of that, fishing people are so *friendly*. Someone always stops to talk to me, and they’ll occasionally give me leftover bait they have when they’re heading home. I’m sure I’ll eventually want to upgrade my gear, but I don’t have to anytime soon and it won’t be hundreds of dollars when I do.

It turns out I’m a major outdoorsy type of person. I have camping plans coming up soon and can’t wait to go hike and fish at the lake there. If I were still smoking I’d be high right now, but instead I woke up early and got my nails done (which I can now afford since I’m not spending all my money on weed), and I’m about to head out to the pond after I post this. Quitting was the best decision I ever made, I would have never discovered something I love doing otherwise.

My advice? Try out all the hobbies you can, the right one will feel fun even if you’re not good at it. Painting, writing, and yoga were always a chore and I told myself it’s because I needed more practice, but now I realize the practicing part is supposed to be enjoyable too.

You can't tell me there hasn't been someone to ever exist who one day up and quit everything, Only to live sober till the day they died. That HAS happened. What needs to happen for us to be those people?

My problem Is I've been a heavy stoner for the past 10 years and while cigarretes were easy to quit, joints were not. Watching series and movies is probably my greatest hobby as I aim to be a writer and I just enjoy it so much, but for the past ten years I've barely watched anything without smoking a joint. It's been a month since I've quit and I cant seem to get myself to watch anything as the minute I do I get huge cravings and the sensation that I'm ""missing out"" by watching something good without being stoned and Im really worried I will never be able to pick this habit back up without weed.

I tried edibles the first week but I cant buy them where I live so I had to make them, and getting the dosage right was so hard to the point that two times I must have ""overdosed"" and I got the biggest panic attacks I have gotten in my entire life and it got to the point where I would get anxious immediately after taking the edible out of fear of getting another one. I also didn't enjoy the fact that for me it took about 2 hours to kick in and the effects lasted way too long.

I just wanted to see if there was anyone out there who went through something similar and know if they ever managed to ""reclaim"" the act of watching stuff without being high and if it was enjoyable.

Weed is difficult to abstain from, although not the worst. I understand many people using other illicit and narcotic medications have a MUCH harder time abstaining. I also understand that some individuals can drop weed faster than a bad date, many people have a psychological and developed physiological withdrawal symptoms. ALL IN ALL: might be easy for you, might be hard. My story (sorry, I know you guys hate these):

Obviously it's been hard for me. I wouldn't be here posting, would I? No. Instead I would be out, not craving to smoke, ""that one last time! that last big hurrah tonight!"", I would tell myself. Started at 14, continued everyday minus a year until 29 (last May). From age 14 to 29, I can honestly claim that four of them were amazing (1.5 without any weed, 3.5 only smoking when it came around).  

During the periods of life when I had quit smoking weed, for longer than 6 months, the emotional connections and interpersonal relationships I developed were like no other I ever experienced while smoking, daily. 

Social life improved, I made outgoing efforts to get out of my shell that really didn't feel like an effort, after a bit of time and practice. Present day: social life just OK, it could be more than it is. I was always taking the easy way out. Realized I was making minimum effort in maintaining or forming new friendships. Everything became to feel stale, I was and have been in such a rut you could refer to it as a shallow grave.

100% of the time - I would be interested in doing X activity, sober. However, I would convince myself that, ""I don't have to do things I don't want do!"". Guess what happened, to no surprise: not a whole-fuck-of-a lot.

Do I want to smoke? Yes. Would I love to smoke? Yes. Would I hate the ACTUAL feeling/high after I smoked. Definitely. Would I tell myself today is the last day, as I have the last 4 months? You got it. Being sober is similar to being high based on current homeostasis. Exercise and reading subreddit's like this, or ANY trivial, niche topic can keep me going for four hours. Just shows me how much worse off my attention span is when 420blazeitdude'd.

Anyways, thats my story. Fourteen years of daily smoking, sometimes a gram a week, sometimes an ounce a week. I have never taken a dab or any sort of concentrate other than cannabudder surprisingly. As much as I won't like this, surely I don't like complaining to myself after smoking everyday, do this for the future me.

Today is my 29th day staying clean; in other words, I've almost made it through the first month! Before I quit I smoked daily for about 2-3 years, 1-3 joints a day at first and 7-8 joints a day near the end. I want to share some positive stuff with you guys today. 

I have been trying to learn cello for 4 years. The last 1-2 years there has been little progress. I blamed it on a lot of things like a lack of talent, a lack of discipline when it comes to practice, a bad training plan etc.

This week I figured out what was actually going on. My perfectionism made practicing stressful. Since I was unable to deal with that stress, I either avoided practice all together or lit up a joint right before practice. I used to think the former was a bigger problem, but it turns out it was the latter.

I practiced for only 3 hours this week but I did it sober and focused. For reference, I should be practicing for about 7 hours to be able to claim I've tackled the discipline problem. Not only did I notice I was making a lot more progress while practicing but I also baffled my teacher with my sudden progress during my lesson today. 

Maybe it sounds really dumb that I've never realized it but trying to learn a new skill is almost impossible if you get high every time you work on it. I'm sure that's at least partly because it disturbs the normal formation of (muscle) memory. It also makes it hard to be present and target problems rather than just going through the motions.

The same appears to be true for trying to get an exercise routine going. Struggled for years, this week I've been exercising every day with little trouble. 

Have you been trying to learn something new? To make some sort of change in your life? Quit smoking. It's making it impossible. 

Tip: if you feel like you can't, start by identifying a common situation that you ""smoke away"" because it is hard for you emotionally (for me that situation was therapy). Make a commitment to not smoke in that situation anymore and make yourself deal with your emotions in that situation. If you aren't sure how, check out mindfulness and emotional intelligence resources. This is how I became able to stop smoking, hope it can help someone else as well.

Today is day 201 for me. I have been working at a cannabis club for a year and a half and am transitioning into the IT field soon. In fact, I just recently got offered a internship for Amazon yesterday! Its quite amazing to see my hard work paying off.

Anyways, I wanted to share something. When I help a customer and ring them up. I ask them how their day is going. They often respond with ""it's going to be better now."", implying that their day wasn't going good until they get to smoke. 

This is something that stood out to me while quitting because I noticed that I was the same way. If I didn't smoke during the day, the idea of smoking would be ruminating in my mind and my day would be filled with agitation, stress,  etc. 

It sucks to have to rely on weed to make your day go well. It sucks to crave getting high throughout the day. It sucks even more when your high and you ran away from your negative feelings instead of dealing with them. This is a vicious cycle that stops you from growing as a person and learning how to conquer your shadow side. I can see it in the people I help and my coworkers. I don't judge them because we are all on our own journeys, but it shows the drastic difference in being sober and using weed. 

Anyways, if I can quit, so can you. I work at a cannabis club and get free products every week, I don't even think of weed anymore. Its just work at this point. The whole notion of using weed has left my mind. 

It gets better. It gets easier everyday. 

Have a great weekend!

After being a daily user (on an off) for almost 7 years, and multiple attempts to ""control it"", e.g.: trying not to smoke every day, but failing; I realised that I just need to quit. 

It magnified my already problematic avoidant personality, and made it completely fine for me to spend my days inside, smoking weed and not really doing anything. I would dread going out, running any errands, hanging out with friends, because that meant I would either have to be sober, or anxious doing it.

Worst of all, I was trying to avoid my girlfriend. I suspected she wasn't a fan of me smoking (even though she denied it), so I would feel bad smoking when she's home.. not like that stopped me though. I would just look forward to her leaving the apartment, so I could smoke without feeling bad.

In the beginning of last year I even started smoking at work. I switched to a full-time remote job just before the pandemic, and I thought it's perfectly fine for me to smoke while working. I didn't feel like I performed any worse, and even felt good about myself, because I was having great ideas, but it turns out I was just fascinated by simple things that I usually take for granted.

Last weekend, I had a talk with my girlfriend, and she finally admitted that it's bothering her. I've been on the fence about quitting for a while, always finding some excuse why not to do it, but this was finally a push to really do it.

It's been 5 days, and so far, I've been seeing more positives than negatives. I wasn't dreading going out of the apartment, I hung out with some friends and even said no when asked if I want to smoke. I was going on bike rides, and just doing small things around the apartment I wasn't even thinking about before, unless my girlfriend asked me to do it.

But today I realised that things that made me happy when I was smoking are causing me a lot of pain and anxiety now. For example, my girlfriend is traveling for work this weekend. A month ago I would be ecstatic about this, as it means I can be high all day, but now I'm really afraid of being alone. I'm afraid I won't be able to handle it and relapse.

Having nice weather, listening to good music are all things where I would get high in the past, to enhance the experience, but now they make me feel sad and it's hard to get through them.

Sorry for the longish post. I needed to put this out there. I will try my best to make it, to keep myself busy, but it's really scary right now.",14,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4356237}"

I've quit smoking weed almost a year ago now, after 6 years of almost daily usage and a strong addiction. I had attempted to quit multiple times just to relapse a few days later, with the longest streak reaching 100 days (I ll have you guess why I did that...).

This year was make it or break it regarding my study, so I put it off for good and focused on the most important exam of my life. 

It went well ! I'm proud of what I accomplished in spite of the years I lost being in the fog and not achieving anything. 

The exams ended 2 days ago, and I hit a joint with friends to celebrate. I've actually enjoyed it, which is nice because before I was smoking and hated myself for it.


But I need to hold myself accountable, and I guess that's why I'm posting here.
Now it's time to stay strong, stay healthy, not fall back in my bad habits, not following the demons. I want to take care of myself.

I don't think I've ended my streak yet, we could argue semantics here but my ultimate goal, moreso than never touching the stuff again, is to not be addicted.

I don't like thinking cannabis is innately bad, but I obviously have an addictive personality and can't just enjoy it here and there. I'm tired of needing a film between myself and reality. I'm tired of spending so much money just to steal time away from myself by being high. I finally have the energy to live and make things happen instead of smoking my future away while wishing I was doing something greater with my life. The greater starts now, and I'm not looking back.",4,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5039643}"

When will I learn?,"Long story short I smoked weed every single day for years and decided to quit cold turkey back in September. The withdrawals were BRUTAL and that’s when I decided to join Reddit and look for support. (Aka you guys) I did so good after I quit. I had my shit together. I was so happy and felt like my old self, family members commented about how happy I seemed….and yep, you guessed it, I smoked again in February. I only smoked for a couple days in a row before I quit smoking again. In March I decided to start gradually smoking again and I just never stopped. Now it’s June and I’m smoking multiple times a day and I’m back to being dependent on weed for my happiness, relaxation and appetite. 

No more!!! I’ve had enough! I have spent all day throwing up from withdrawals, not being able to eat, crying hysterically. My boyfriend is reassuring me that I have done this before and now I know not to start back up again. I know I can live without it and I actually look forward to being completely clean again. I just HATE MYSELF for always repeating my bad behavior and addictions. Why did I this to myself again when I knew the withdrawal symptoms were a bitch?! This is my fault and I take full responsibility but I just feel disappointed in myself. I don’t think I’ll ever smoke weed again in my life. Now I know I am not someone who can occasionally smoke ever. I don’t have the self discipline with weed to not smoke every day. I miss how I felt when I was just quitting smoking in September and rediscovering who I am as a person without using weed as a crutch.

As for me, I'm 2 weeks into this crazy journey. Been smoking daily since 8th grade, now I'm almost 32. It's been a way of life for me for as long as I can remember. I stopped once when I was 18 to pass a UA, but went right back to it after that was done.

I started this journey because of a possible job opportunity where I would be required to take UA about once a month. When I quit I was still in love with Mary Jane.. just two weeks later and my current mindset is that this is the right thing to do regardless of whether or not I pursue this career change. I feel like I'm just ready to be done.

I did not expect real withdrawal symptoms. Chills, headaches, no appetite, no energy, depression/anxiety, and insomnia. Most of these are clearing up pretty well, but still having a bit of an issue sleeping at times (I work graveyard, so that's a contributing factor for sure).

The one that's not wanting to budge is the damn anxiety! My head is just crammed full of thoughts that are moving at a million miles an hour, and worries that I never even knew existed. Excersize is helping a bit, and I'm trying to stay busy. But damn, this is hard. 

I'm considering trying some supplements or non-perscrip meds soon, but kinda want to wait it out a bit longer. If this hangs around too long, I'll be reaching out to my doc, but I have reservations about prescription medications, as I had some pretty bad experiences with them as a kid. I just really don't want to become dependant on yet another substance.

Anyone been down this road before? Did you need to something to quiet your head? Did it get better after some time? Am I ruined forever? 

Sorry for the long post, but I feel like this was a good outlet. Wishing the best for all of us walking down this road!",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.39234808}"
2021-06-18 00:53:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/o2gzz9/avoiding_pain_or_gaining_pleasure/,Avoiding Pain or Gaining Pleasure,"Hey all i’m going to make this quick to save your time. 

I’m on like 5 days of not smoking which is pretty impressive cause all 3 of my roommates loveeeee smoking. 

So in the past it’s been pretty easy for me to fall back into it because it’s right there in front of me…you know? 

Well not so much anymore…

There’s a man called Tony Robbins who taught me that ALL humans do what they do to either avoid pain or gain pleasure. 

Once stated, it seems pretty damn obvious, right? That’s why i smoked in the first place. INSTANT PLEASURE. But…

That’s no longer who i want to be. I’ve been using weed as an emotional crutch for far too long. I’m a 23 y/o male and i intuitively feel it’s time to grow up (not saying you’re not grown up for smoking i just personally think this for myself as it’s holding me back). 

What’s nice about this pain and pleasure thing is that we will do way more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure. 

I’m going to type that again so you understand. 

Humans will do way more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure. 

Let that sink in before reading and try to see if you can relate to it

…

Did it sink in?

Good. 

So how do we determine what’s painful or pleasurable? Simple. The meaning associated to it. 

i used to have pleasurable feelings associated with smoking as i’m sure all of you do (or did)

But i’ve attached a new meaning to smoking to make me realize that it’s painful to me and my growth. 

…

Where am i going to be in 5 years if i don’t quit?

How’s it effecting my growth?

What’s my health going to look like?

How’s it effecting my relationships?

How much money am i wasting on marijuana? 

How much money would i save if i didn’t smoke?

How much more energy would i give myself if i quit?

…

By asking questions like these i’m slowly associating that smoking is really a detriment to my life. That if i don’t quit it’s going to cost me way more in my life than if i continue to. 

i’m creating leverage on myself to quit. That i must quit. 

Now that i have leverage i’m going to use my imagination. You have one right?

Thought so

What i do is i imagine myself smoking and i pick something absolutely disturbing or disgusting and link the two together (aka a new association)

i’ll give you an example: 

…

i used to work as a patient transporter at a hospital and there was one patient who was so overweight their skin was bursting and flaking off and smelled ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. 

So the creative genius i am, i used this awful memory to my advantage by imagining those skin flakes in my weed or roommates weed when they offer me a hit

You bet your ass i’m not smoking that shit. That’s gross as f***! Imagine if i hit that and inhaled some of those skin flakes? Yeah no thank you

…

You might be thinking … skin flakes? not smoking? wth?

All i can say is yes 

By creating that synthetic idea of something disturbing/painful/cringeworthy and linking it to smoking i don’t have the desire to. I created a new meaning. 

If i smoke i’m not only going to inhale those nasty ass skin flakes that’ll make me want to cringe and throw up but i’m also losing money, effecting my future self and relationships, and am not moving towards my goals like i’d like to. 

i may not have explained it the best cause i’m no teacher or great writer like some but i think you get the point. Create more pain to smoking and more pleasure to not smoking. 

I hope you try this and i pray that it works for you as it is me and if it doesn’t i hope you find your own way.

Of course, the boys found out about the scheme and confronted the parents about it. When cornered, Randy Marsh gives what is, in my opinion, the best and most honest answer as to why you should avoid drugs, even less harmful ones like marijuana. He says:

""Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but… well, son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored. And it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative.

I am a 38 F who has been smoking weed since I was 15. All legal since Canada legalized it. Anywhere from 3-5 joints after work. Never in the morning and never during the day at work.

For the last 8 months I’ve been feeling quite awful. I was diagnosed with Cyclic vomiting Syndrome in November due to an extremely stressful situation at work. Now I’m thinking it’s not CVS but CHS. I will have months feeling fine and then BAM I’m a mess. Upset stomach every morning until I get sick. I didn’t smoke anything Tuesday but caved and had a few puffs yesterday to try and ease the headache and settle my stomach. Today so far nothing but all I want is to get high. I smoke flower and take the occasional gummy 15-20mg. Funny thing is that these symptoms only happen Monday through Friday when I work. I can smoke all weekend and be fine. Is it just stress? Is it the weed? Ugh I just don’t know.

I guess my question is how do you do it? How do you get through this feeling of with-drawl? Is there anything I can take that would help? Is quitting cold turkey the wrong way to do this and maybe tapering down would be better? Everything I’ve read about CHS tells me if I keep going this way I’m headed for a pretty nasty phase and getting the THC out of my system is the only way to see if it really is CHS. Pretty sure I’m a walking thc hit and it’s going to be a long hard haul.

I can’t eat, I have absolutely no appetite. I can drink and keep liquids down just fine. Not a lot of people know how big of a stoner I really am. I’m a very high functioning stoner. 

What helped you quit? What did you do about the headaches and restless nights??? How long did it take you to feel normal again?

Didn't realize what a bitch the withdrawal symptoms would be, but that's all over now. I gained back all the weight I lost and then some, although my lifestyle is much healthier now that I'm not smoking at all. To anyone going through the same thing I did, trust me, it gets better. I recommend making a post like this one to look back to when you're tempted to smoke again, because oh lord do I fight that temptation every night. Psychologically and physically I feel so much better, I'm so glad. Good luck to anyone out there who has to struggle with the same. 

These past two weeks have been filled with so much pain and misery that I had no idea was possible from smoking weed. I love weed. I've been smoking daily since quarantine, it's helped me so much.

The last time I took a couple puffs was Monday. Tuesday I had to go to the ER because I could not stop puking and was in so much pain. Dr said they see it all the time, and that I had to stop all weed consumption to make it better.

It's Thursday and I thought I would be feeling better by now but oh lord. I still feel so nauseous, headachy, and I have to literally force myself to eat just a bowl of rice. That's all I've eaten today, and I don't know if I can hold it down. I can't sleep, and I'm consistently getting shaking chills. I've been tested for everything under the sun and it all came back negative. Weed withdrawal and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome are the only answer to how I'm feeling.

I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced this, and if so, how long do these symptoms last? I've lost an unhealthy amount of weight in the past few weeks because I can't eat anything. On top of all that, I don't have weed to help with my anxiety disorder.

Does this mean I can never smoke again? Like if a couple years from now if I decide to get high with friends does this mean it'll happen all over again? The dr's said that would be the case, but it's hard to believe.

I had my last smoke 6 hours ago and already I want to go buy some more. I’ve been smoking on and off for the last 7 years. The longest I’ve gone without it since I started being 3 months. 

At the beginning of the year I was 1 month sober. I think since February or March I’ve been doing it pretty much every day all day. First thing in the morning, throughout the day, right before sleep.

I really enjoy doing it for the most part. I love doing things while high especially watching movies.

I do it a lot lately because life seems so absurd and makes no sense when I’m sober. My job is stressful as well. When I’m high, life is more tolerable and enjoyable. Weed gets me out of my head for a bit and away from my problems.

Lately I was thinking of quitting because I ran out of my supply and the high is weak and maybe lasts 30 minutes. Also the last couple days I have been more depressed and anxious than usual. Also I don’t really remember much of the last few months. I feel great when I’m high but when I start to come down I can’t remember much of what I was doing while high.

I have been on different depression medications in the past and felt mostly numb along with other bad side effects. I started smoking weed again after being off the medications and was able to actually experience emotions and feel good.

The problem I have with weed is that I can’t control myself with it. I will smoke it until it’s gone. I can’t really moderate my use until I can barely get high any more. Honestly I would still be using if I still felt a good high.

I find it hard to imagine myself quitting forever because it definitely has some positive effects on my life I just tend to abuse it. 

I am not sure what to do. Right now I am thinking about maybe a 2 or 3 week break but I am not sure I will last that long. I don’t really want to quit right now but I feel like I should take a break.

Yesterday was my first day since probably 2019 that I didn’t think about weed. For the last two years I was hitting a dab pen dozens and dozens of times a day.

Another thing I noticed that’s completely random: I was a compulsive nail biter before, I have been my whole life to get honest, even before weed. But after stopping weed I haven’t been biting my nails at all! It’s been a pleasant surprise and one of the many reasons to stay sober. 

Now that Ive partially gotten this monkey off my back, it’s time to focus on other areas of my life. I’ve gotten a gym membership and I’m gonna go for the first time in ages tonight! Im focusing on getting my weight back up from a seriously unhealthy 105 pounds (5’10) to my goal weight :)

I've been a heavy smoker for the last 5ish years, and before a little less frequently since I was about 18 years old (I'm 28 now). I came to my decision to stop after making some haphazard purchases this past winter. In the depths of covid depression and winter despair I purchased an insane amount of second hand designer clothing - now I'm swimming in debt and out of necessity I need to examine every purchase I make. Realized spending hundreds of dollars on weed a month was not in the best interests of my wallet or my health.

I'm a registered nurse and would use weed to fall asleep after 12 hr night shifts. I somehow was not aware how fucking detrimental smoking is to dental and gum health and over the course of the last few years my mouth is in poor poor shape. Sometime this May it clicked that I was going to likely lose my teeth if I continued at the rate that I was. Thankfully, with the support of my partner we both decided to quit. We had both fallen into some codependent habits re: our weed usage over the course of our relationship. Doing it together definitely helps. 

I'm on day 17 now and I hit one of my worst emotional lows in almost a decade this past week. I've mentioned in another comment that I can't stop catastophrizing. My work schedule has been shit this past week (been working every other day for 6 12 hour shifts in a row, and I take care of cancer patients so you can imagine the compassion fatigue I'm feeling) and I hit rock hard bottom several times in the past few days. Thoughts of not deserving anything, thoughts of abandoning my relationship, thoughts that nothing good deserves to come my way. I realized that life stressors + dopamine bottoming out is likely why I feel this way - and that thought helps lessen my feelings of helplessness because I know it will pass and I will feel better in the long term. 

I'm ready to stop feeling like I need to succumb and dip out of consciousness to be okay with myself. I want to be more present in my life. I'm about two weeks closer to that. Thank you all for your presence.",5,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54271936}"

This past weekend I met up with a few of my friends who I went to college with and they were also the gang I originally picked up smoking with 6 years ago. All still smoking except for one who does only on the occasions we meet up. This was our first meet-up after a year of being in lockdown as we all live in different parts of the country since we graduated.

I had a great weekend with them, although as soon as it was all over and I had to come home, I felt heavy emotion wash over me and memories flooding back. I felt as though I hit breaking point.

I have realised that for the past 6 years I’ve clung onto weed as a distraction from my deeper feelings.

I’ve wanted to quit for a long time, I think about quitting almost as much as I think of smoking. Something feels different this time, I feel if I can pull through and stop buying that I will eventually see that I don’t need weed in my life anymore. 

I am truly scared that I will slip into smoking and becoming complacent again. I live at home with my Mum and sibling who all know about my smoking. The two people who I buy from were fairly innocent in the beginning but have become known criminals for other offences who I get so paranoid about when it come time to buy more (but the cravings push me to go anyway)

As many people say here, I do love weed and have had great times with it. But would love to experience even one year in my 20s without it.

I'm on day 12 of not smoking after an 8-year, 3g/day habit. I'm having an amazing time with it, yay, finally clear!

Gaming is one of my life long hobbies (among others) and I can feel how I'm getting better at it again now that weed isn't clouding my mind. It would be nice to have some sober gaming buddies, since many people game while baked.

I'm 33m on the East Coast in Canada, it would be cool if you were in the Americas as well, for time zone reasons. I have the chill vibe of a guy who likes to spend lots of time in nature, meditate, read, and party. I vibe well with people who keep a cool, jovial, positive attitude and don't blame losses on people. Gaming is supposed to be fun. :)

As far as games go I enjoy mostly  survival or RPG games like **The Forest**, **Borderlands**, **Valheim**, **Path of Exile**, **Rust**, **Subnautica**. I also like shooters such as **PUBG** and **Apex Legends**. Also RTS games like **Company of Heroes** or **Age of Empires.** I'm always happy to discover and buy new games as well, e.g. I have **Valheim** sitting in my library but haven't played it yet.

The first few days weren’t awful. I had some energy, probably because I felt confident.

Then day 3 hit. It was awful. Woke up in a pool of sweat, had tons of outbursts and intense mood swings. Cried myself to sleep that night. By Day 5, the night sweats decreased significantly and I was feeling fairly good. Then Day 8, it was another morning of sobbing and hell. 

A few days after that, I’m feeling so much better. I’m present in my conversations. I can read and watch something and actually remember what happened. Although I still wake up in the night, my sleep feels so much more gratifying than before. I’m even dreaming now! Last night I had a dream where alligators were in my backyard and a velociraptor was chasing me on my deck. I live in Canada, so it was very weird. But it was very fun. 

I know there will be challenging days ahead. But there will also be great days. For those struggling, I found cardio and exercise to be my saving grace. If I get a craving, I’ll do some pushups or run around the block. 

Having goals helps too. I’m trying to improve my writing and vocabulary. That’s something I would’ve never thought about doing while stoned.

I do have a question though. How do you feel about alcohol while quitting? Last weekend I had a few beers on Friday and Saturday. Friday I didn’t feel any cravings to smoke at all. Saturday, there was a hint of it. But it wasn’t as bad as I thought it might be. I feel like I can limit my alcohol to weekends only, whereas with weed it starts with just weekends only, and always grows to a nightly thing.

My usage has dramatically increased over the last 2 years and I'm embarrassed to say that I was stoned 24/7. Anyways I'm DONE with weed. I cannot continue to hurt myself anymore.

The past year, my anxiety has been through the roof. I’ve discovered a new paranoid side of me, always related to the same subject: a paranoia that my husband is cheating on me, even though there’s litteraly 0% chances that he is given that we are together 24/7. I’ve even come to the point where I think he has an emotional affair with someone (that I imagine) he texts only when he’s in the bathroom (the only moment I couldn’t see it). Complete paranoia. It’s been hell for the both of us to deal with this anxiety/paranoia and just today it came to my mind that maybe it was weed playing with my brain. 

I want to stop. I need serious help and I can’t go on any longer like that. I don’t know anything about the first thing when trying to quit an addiction, so any tips would be welcome. 

I’m really scared but I want to get better. Do you think it’s possible that this anxiety is coming from weed? I think I need reassurance that this state of mind is gonna pass once I stop.

Once I moved to college, I started playing football, there were drug tests and at first I was super orthodox with my approach to a no drug policy. After about 2 months of continuous work, practice, films, and games, I found myself disregarding the tests and smoking to suppress my unhappiness with the sport I thought I loved. I eventually let the weed consume me, I quit football, I even contemplated killing myself, the one thing I kept in my life was weed. 
Once I quit, I began smoking every day, it became “therapy” and my form of medication. I’ve retained the idea that this is good for me since I quit football.

One of my oldest friends and I have been distant for awhile now. Instead of avoiding the difficult conversation and disassociating from how I felt with cannabis, we dug deep into the pain/anger and actually worked through some of our issues. After sorting it out, she confessed to me that one of the reasons she put space between us is because of my smoking and how I used it to avoid dealing with my problems and feelings. It wasn’t healthy for her own mental health to be surrounded by someone like that. I asked her why she didn’t tell me sooner, and she said she was scared to lose me completely and that I might have reacted negatively (and I probably would have). Damn, did it hurt to hear that, but also added yet another reason to stay weed free.

This is just a very confusing journey, and atm I can't make any sense of it myself so bear with me.... 

Story time:
I've been using weed when I was around 24, this was just once a month, sometimes every 2 weeks I ate a weed browny for just a fun time, when I knew I had nothing to do, and it was just ""me time"". 

The rule was always for me at that time
- I needed to have 2 days off (since those brownies hitted me hard al the time) 
- I needed to be in a good state of mind (it had to be an reward, not consealing a bad mood or depressive/down moments) 

Only then I consider eating a weed browny. 
Looking back it was very occasionally. 

Fast forward to 1/1,5 years a go (when I was 27ish) , I've been researching vaping.
I diddnt wanted to be fatigue the next day after eating a edible so I Bought my first vaporiser.
I've never liked smoking, that's why I never smoked a joint, and only did edibles. 

I took a vaporiser, since vaping made it easier to dose.
Instead of needing to be 2 days off (where the second day I was fatigue of the edible) now I can dose it correctly to just an evening, and the next day I'm good, and (some times) even more energetic, and I could do more the second day instead of being fatigue all day. 

My weed use increased during the corona lockdown, it helped me trough the lockdown days, where only 2 small hits helped alot to get trough the whole days of doing nothing and not to get to clunged up in my mind. 
I did with 0.3 grams almost like 5 days (had 5 temp settings so went each day just 1 temp up and took the hits).
Note that it was more of the boredom, there was no fear for me getting fired or anything, since I work for a very strong company, so no depressions or stress of losing my house or job.... 

Fast forward to the 6 weeks ago
I've bought a better vaporiser (the mighty). 

Now work is back to normal, and live is good. 
I'm settled, bought a house, got a very sweet GF. 

But now comes the part, where does weed fit in? 
The mighty makes it so easy to be high every night (especially with dosing capsules) , but I keep asking myself now why I'm getting high? 

Im not depressed, I'm very happy with my life (atleast I think). 
Finance = good
Family = good
I've got a roof above my head and all bills are payed. 

I was at a point, where I'm smoking 3x a week a 0.3g a time only in the evening. 
But somehow my gut feeling is telling me that this is a tip over moment in my life where I can see myself smoking everyday..... And consume even more. 

I cannot see in myself why I was smoking it?
Am I bored?
Do I just want to get high?
Why do I want to get high? 

I'm was in a vicious cycle when I'm ""sober"" I'm thinking I need to smoke, and plan the setup (a lone evening).
But the moment my GF stays up (I then don't smoke) I get so angry (inside, I'm not expressing it) at her, for denying me that high moment lone time in the evening. 

My live now feels, there is a demon somewhere, but I can't seem to see it.... 
This is already day 3 of not smoking, and various thoughts are going trough my brain: 

Thought:
I want to smoke! 

Me:
But why? 

Thought:
Just do it, you must, you gonna feel great after! 

And here I am, figuring out why I need to get high in the evening....

I've needed it before, to get trough the corona days, but now it just feels different. 

And the past week even when I'm high (I have a good feeling ofcourse, not what people are saying here getting hyper or getting ancious) but a feeling/tought keeps coming up: 

-Are you happy now high?
-Is this your moment?
-why are you doing this? 
-do I need to quit smoking weed
-it isn't it as bad as you think
-  this is normal
-  am I myself? 
- am I happy? 

Sorry for the bad English and just confusing story, but I just don't know where to go from here...... 

I couldn't find myself in most of the story's shared here, since people saying they smoking for years every day, or started very young, that's why I'm sharing this story.

But I'm now on day 3 of quitting, I need to find myself again, weed defenetly did something here in my life.
But was/am I depressed?

Now here im just so confused and asking myself why was I high everytime.... , this drug is not something to mess with, it defenetly alters some wires up ur brain.....

But yeah, day 3.... What you guys think? Or is this just the reason, weed hits everyone differently in their lifes.

I even feel my vision going a little off. I'm staying with family until the end of the week but will eventually have to deal with this on my own, 100's of miles away and without a support system. I can't extend the trip because of my work commitments. 

I'm typing this as I try to deep breathe my way out of another anxiety attack. This is awful. If anyone has any tips I would love to hear them!

Edit: I also just had the realisation that it could be linked to my morning coffee as it started at around the same time yesterday. I only drink one cup a day so will switch to decaffe for now. But I also drank coffee on the days I didn't have attacks so not sure there's a connection....

Second Edit: UPDATE so it took me about an hour to bring myself around and I did it by smelling the shit out of some lavender oil, taking a bath, binaural beats, deep breathing and reminding myself it is because of withdrawals.

I (F29, UK) Started smoking weed a bit when I was about 20 now and then. Then it became much more regular during my masters course at age 24-26. I hated the course, myself and my life and was seriously mentally unwell. Basically having a massive mental breakdown during the course and had to go part time. My friend supplied it for free and we would enjoy. I saw it as part of recovery at the time.  I'm an alcoholic (at the time I knew I had an alcohol issue but didn't really acknowledge addiction) and weed seemed less destructive so I guess I kind of used it to 'help' cut down, as I'd get 'wasted' in a calmer way. Fast forward a bit and I went through wake and bake; obsessing about supply; panicking; damaging relationships with friends, family, husband; getting high alone and all that. It became a problem, it's own kind of addiction and basically went through a couple of years of that. 

Fast forward again and I'm struggling so hard to quit long term. I'm in AA recovery for drinking, doing 12 steps and all that so thats going well (nearly 5 months, yay). Weed is now more of a Friday night thing but I end up obsessing over when I'll next smoke. Im struggling so bad with quitting weed properly. I want to quit full stop but I have this compulsion that takes over me every so often if I don't for a while.  Can anyone relate to that?

I just keep going back to weed, and the 2 or 3 friends who have nothing going on for themselves who supply. I don't know if it's a desperation to keep them in my life. They are nice people but really don't particularly do anything else. I work full time in a job I like, have a lovely husband (M 31) and daughter (F, 2) and nice other friends. Maybe I'm addicted to the friends? By the way I never smoke around my daughter. 

These friends were there for me when I was very mentally ill (supplying weed to chill out and distract). I know I need to quit. It's been nearly a week without smoking weed. I always regret it when I have smoked. I always feel fuzzy and like I've wasted my time. It makes my skin awful, I get paranoid and can't function properly. Basically I know I have a problem and I'm desperate to quit but I just don't know how to! 

How can I quit weed, and the kind of codependent friendships linked to it? I have BPD so I guess I cling on to friends and substances I guess as a coping mechanism. It's better than it was but I know my life will be better if I completely quit. So why can't I?!

I stayed using on and off for 9 years because I love how it numbs me out. 

I am a chronic over-thinker and catastrophizer. My mom and brother died very tragically when I was 6 and I had a workaholic criminal defence attorney as a father.  He has a terrible temper and can be quite volatile and emotionally abusive. He is also wonderful, but he has never dealt with his trauma and is damaged because of it. He remarried a woman when I was nine and she was truly awful to me and was extremely psychologically abusive and extremely unkind. She made me believe that I was truly unlovable and that coupled with the trauma of losing my brother and mom has made me an extremely fragile person. 

I have worked very hard to make a success of my life and have a really great job that pays well, as well a lot of respect in the industry I work in. I am a career woman and have somehow been able to excel even though I have been heavily self medicating along the way. I justify smoking cause it takes the edge off and helps me unwind from a demanding 12 - 16 hour day filled with meetings and endless demands. I have convinced myself over and over again that it helps me, but as my usage creeps up the cracks start to show. I am not myself and my mental health is not where it should be. 

I constantly feel like everyone hates me and I worry about everything all the time. My anxiety is through the roof and I have disturbing nightmares every night. Weed sometimes dims them a little but they are always there. Waiting for me in the darkness. I feel better when I am not smoking but when a really stressful time bubbles up I always relapse. This last time I was sober for 6 months, but I relapsed a month ago and went bananas. Smoked all day every day and lost my mind a bit. I have once again found the courage to try quit and am 3 days sober. It's a real challenge and my mood swings are wild. I find myself crying uncontrollably, can't eat anything, can't sleep and feel like a stiff breeze will blow me over. Work is a shit show and I have been working like a dog. I feel like the walls are closing in and that I am a truly worthless individual. I find myself berating myself in my mind all day. I am white knuckling it but I am so scared I am going to lose grip again. I wanna be better than this and get off this shitty rodeo. This withdrawing part is so hard and I just feel utterly fucked. I have secretly been struggling in silence all this time, because I don't want to confide in my friends or family. I don't want to be draining or thought of as an addict. I just want to live a happy life and love myself, but I find it so hard. It seems impossible. I know I am not alone, but it sure feels like it. This week has been the worst and I am a sad sad lady with bursts of madness, sadness, anger and big time brain fog. It feels like the world is just so goddam noisy right now.",18,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5429279}"

I’m posting this to show the difference between when I started and when I quit, hopefully this may inspire others. I started smoking around 15yrs old, it turned into a weekend thing to quickly an everyday thing, and toward my last 2 years of smoking I would take .5g bong rips every hour and a half or so. I’m 20yrs old now, I never envisioned myself quitting until the last time I smoked and received a horrible panic attack, I barely remember the last 5 years and only can recall key memories, my excuse to keep smoking during this time was “I still get stuff done” or “It’s just weed how bad can it be?” And “It’s an alternative ADHD medication” (even some of the prescription ones were no use for me, I’ve tried almost every ADHD med) Also, weed has been a gateway drug for me, I’ve tried other drugs because weed jacked up my reward system, I even started selling just to fund my habit. During my usage I always half-assed my jobs and lost a few due to having little to no motivation. Over the last month I have achieved more than I have in the last 5 years, I found god, I’m now pursuing a real estate license, and finally got a new car! I’ve also met some new amazing people outside of the stoner crowd. Also people can see the difference in your face! Your eyes are bright and colored, and not all stoned looking, and your face overall just looks brighter. I just want everyone to know that if I can do it you can do it too! Feel free to drop any questions you might have! and DM me if you need some support, I hope any current smokers out there found this useful. Stay up and bless up

I drowned my brain in that weed based sleep paralysis for so long. The fact that I’m out of it right now in a waking state is uncanny to me, something I feel like I never would have chosen before.

I can't count how many times I've quit. Every time, my withdrawal symptoms are pretty intense, and that doesn't even stop me. I used to be capable and really get shit done, now I can barely do my job because I am either fucked up from the night before or I'm going through withdrawal. I can only take so many sick/vacation days. I missed my vaccination appointment today because I was high. During my sober spurts, I always end up going back to weed because I can't see a path to a future where I am fulfilled.

I just want to be with someone. Someone to be there for me when I need them and vice versa. Someone to hold. I'm a gay guy in my mid 20s and have never been in a serious relationship, nothing more than flings. I don't really vibe with gay culture, and I'm not very attracted to most gay guys. Dating when you are gay is hard enough, and being picky doesn't help, but there's not much I can do. I've been on a fair number of dates, never met someone I really clicked with. Most gay guys my age aren't even interested in a committed relationship it seems.

Also, I've been in love with my straight best friend for years (I know...). It causes me a lot of pain knowing there is nothing I can do that could lead him to have the slightest interest in me. It took me a very long time for me to accept that there is not a chance of him being gay. He is the only person I feel like I can really open up to, but when I go to him it also hurts me because it's hard not to think about how much just a hug would mean from him. I hate how this makes it difficult to want the best for him, since the best for him doesn't involve me. I do my best to be a good friend, but there have been times when I break a sobriety streak when he tells me about a promising dating prospect. I think I'd probably have an easier time getting over him if I wasn't so damn picky when it comes to gay folk.

This is a rant, so why stop now. I was lucky enough to achieved my career dreams when I was pretty young. Unluckily, what I thought was my dream job turned out to the worst job I've ever had, and I abandoned the industry. Now I have a different job that pays well, but I don't give a shit about it enough to try to be good at it. My experience of getting my dream job only to get fucked by it has really drained my motivation to look for something new. Where I am now is fine as far as jobs go, but I don't want to get a new job only to find out I left a decent job for another one that sucks.

We’re talking 5:30am till 9pm, every hour. I could polish of an eighth in maybe 2-3 days? I live in a legal state and had no one to tell me to keep it in check. I do have a wife and 2 young kids but was always “responsible” with my smoking(no driving, paying close attention to family). But after a week of sobriety I’ve realized that I have barely been present for my children’s entire life. I started getting anxiety attacks last year(short breath, shaking, feeling of dread). The attacks always hit after a toke. I haven’t had many, maybe 5 attacks in the last 2 years, but they were VERY intense. The last one I had sealed the deal for me that it is time to quit. 

I truly never thought I would quit, I pictured myself old and gray and still smoking. The first few days were tough but it really is getting better and better. One of my biggest concerns was the lack of appetite. I am 6 feet tall and last week weighed 155 and now I’m down to 146. I can’t really afford to lose too much weight. Also, like most people, I have a very hard time being bored. Like a genuine psychological problem with it, and let me tell ya, I’ve felt that “bored” feeling quite a lot in the last week. 

The reason I’m posting is to thank all of you for what you are doing here. I have been lurking on Reddit for over a decade and made an account to tell you all that I am definitely one of those “if I can do it, you can do it” people.

The good things are absolutely starting to outweigh the bad things at this point. My appetite is back, my sleep is amazing, my wife can see and hear the difference in my face and voice. I have gone to 2 social functions since I quit. It truly feels like I’m waking up. It’s not all sunshine and roses, but it is MUCH better than before, and I look forward to what’s next. I haven’t “looked forward” to anything in a long time.

3) working out & actually having good workouts
4) feeling proud of yourself 
5) connecting with my partner, friends & family more 
6) more inclined to be social 
7) no more instant high regrets (every time I smoked I felt great then 5 minutes later I’d feel disgusting, embarrassed, ashamed & I would tell myself I want to stop. Then it would go away & I’d forget that feeling
8) more thoughtful with what I’m putting into my body. Every time I smoke I want whatever food is handy, easy or pre made. When I’m sober I take time to meal prep, cook great balanced meals 
9) good sleep! It takes a few weeks to get there but there’s no better feeling than literally consciously putting yourself to bed rather than pass out cause I’m too high & didn’t brush my teeth
10) no brain fog in the morning after I smoked heavily the night before 
11) music feels better, I can really enjoy music

In the past i’ve lasted a couple of weeks weed free only for my mood to still be low, my depression still here and my anxiety still riding high. I used to think quitting weed would solve all my issues and that my dependency was the root cause of all my issues, which was obviously not the case, simply an additional layer to the many issues i’ve always had.

This time it feels different, i’m at a good place in my career, i’ve continued to stay motivated on work, and feel more mature in general. I’ve also gained a lot of weight and my health has declined over lockdown, two things that can be directly attributed to my cannabis intake.

So this time round, i’m diving in head first with a fresh mindset, quitting weed isn’t going to solve all the problem in my life, but it’s a great first step to getting some of the bits i’m unhappy about back on track. 

If anyone knows of any particularly good resources to stay motivated and clean, then please let me know!

I don't ever want to smoke again but I'm not sure if I want to be anti-smoking in the context of dating, I guess. I'm wondering though if I should be. How have some of the veteran quitters handled it? I know for me when I was smoking that anyone who wasn't a smoker I would lose a bit of interest in since I felt like it wouldn't work long term.

I really didn’t think I could do it. To be fair, I was kind of forced into it. My hubby and I went on our late honeymoon two weeks ago to a very non-green friendly place, so I was knowingly going into this without access to my daily habit. It wasn’t fun feeling the withdrawal effects while trying to enjoy a vacation, but I honestly think that also helped in many ways. Being by the ocean, out of my comfort zone, etc.

When we got home, we were out of our stash anyway so I decided to roll with it because if there was any time I was going to succeed, it was now when I already had a head start.

I feel so, so so so so much better. My body is starting to regulate again, I’m starting to not sweat so much at night, and it’s becoming easier every day to think of weed as the enemy and not a friend.

If I can do this, you can too. I have tried for years on and off to quit, with no success until now. So I guess my advice would be if you’re struggling to stay away, try to remove yourself from your usual habitat for a couple days or as long as you can I guess. Even if it’s not far away, just do anything you can to remove yourself from your daily routine. It truly was the difference for me.",12,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.64506567}"

Normally I’d be devastated and beat myself up for breaking a streak, but lately I’ve been inspired by the posts I’ve read here about not letting obsession with “streaks” define your quitting. In the past I’d consider myself a failure for having smoked and that self-depreciation would drive me to a low emotional place that would lead me to smoke again. It was a vicious cycle. But now I’ve begun to accept that it’s not important how many days in a row I haven’t gotten high. It’s only important that I’m getting high fewer and fewer days than I used to and I’m trending in the right direction towards quitting for good. 

Not only that, but I also noticed that how I react when I’m high has also improved. In the past I kept my house stocked with sugary trash that I would binge on for hours while I was high. Last night I raided my fridge only to find clementines, sugar-free apple sauce, and plain Cheerios :).

&#x200B;

I hope you all are doing well. I wanted to share a bit about my journey and what's been going on, and what my life has been like since quitting as of April 2021. I smoked regularly and high-potency strains for about 2 years, especially throughout the pandemic.

I quit because of a terrible edible misdose that led to Derealization-Depersonalization symptoms that lasted for up to six weeks. It was the scariest recovery of my life, but I am officially 2 months clean as of this week, and still I feel off. My symptoms as of this month include:

\- Massive anxiety jolts that happen randomly throughout the week

\- Depression, feeling lonely, angry, isolated, and stuck in my head.

\- Sometimes I experience dimmed emotions, such as diminished capacity for joy or sometimes it feels just emotionally null.

\- Still experiencing vivid or intense dreams that leave me feeling anxious or dreadful in the morning.

\- And the most recent symptom I've caught lately is false-memory recall, or thinking that something happened but then quickly realizing that it didn't happen and distinguishing it as either a dream or a false memory.

These sound scary I know, but I wanted to understand if this is a result of Weed PAWS (Post-Acute-Withdrawal Syndrome) or some other specific disease? I have been diagnosed with clinical depression in the past, but this feels more intense at times.

Just so happen to coincide last night that we were going to hang out. He has a homemade smoker and we smoked two huge chickens and some vegetables and ate some great food. Yesterday was my 21st day. He did ask right at the beginning if I was still not smoking and I said ""yep it's an indefinite thing."" That was all. He did almost accidentally passed me the bowl at one point because his brother was there smoking with him too. His brother's also a close friend. But he quickly caught himself and passed it to his brother. No pressure.

Today is day 22. Feels good. I never really thought the dreaming thing was going to be as big as everybody talked about? Holy shit. I didn't realize. I'm dreaming so fucking much.

I’ve tried quitting before but always with the acknowledgment that I’d be back to use again on occasion. But this time something just clicked: I don’t love weed more than I love me. I missed me more than I could miss weed. I saw the harmful patterns, the things I was missing. I tried to look at my life in retrospect like: when I’m 80 is this something I’ll be happy I did. And I just felt sad for all the things I’d already missed out on. 
I got past the first few weeks of severe cravings. Made it through the CHS and the sadness. Made it through a difficult day without wanting that outlet. 

When I first started reading this thread I was so ashamed at how much harder I felt it was for me to quit. I’d been smoking for the past 3 years. But this time I used accountability with some non smoker friends I trusted to support me. I let my partner know how much his use impacted me. We started working out more and practicing discipline in other areas of our lives as well. 

I still occasionally think on it but all I can think of when I think of smoking now is the way my body couldn’t keep food down afterwards. The way I don’t really ENJOY the feeling like I used to. I think of the clarity that I enjoy having, and the way I can shut my mind off when it wants to obsess about social interactions. It helps to stave off the craving long enough for me to transition into doing something I enjoy or something productive.

Eating food - better smoke

Everything I done needed to be associated with weed, and I couldn't enjoy anything without it.

I used my justification and money aspect to my advantage, and decided to transfer myself £5 a day into savings (my daily spend on weed) and today the account hit £120, and my other half would have saved the same amount, thats almost £250 that our household would have ""lost"" to weed, and that does not include all of the indirect spending such as extra food and takeaways.

I haven’t left my house in months because I lost my job which made me fall into a bad spot and me quitting made me physically exhausted and hurting to be honest.

I always felt like I was going to vomit to having a brain cracking migraine. I barely spoke to anyone because no one was looking out for me because I had just vanished off the face of the earth. I can’t sleep most of the time and when I do it’ll be almost a full day til I actually wake up(sleeping for at least 10 hours). I don’t necessarily have the urge to smoke but I think if I did it would make me feel a little bit better than I am now. Weed really helped me just cut out my feelings at the time so I ignored everything that’s as happening to me so I felt like there was no problem. But now I see the problem whether or not it’s my mental state or wax. I had to make a decision to quit. The dreams are almost like real life I can almost feel it and taste it. I haven’t dreamt in years at least vividly remember what had happened. Throughout the day I’m very irritable and nauseous with a huge appetite but not wanting to make myself sick so I stayed away from foods for a whole two days. Getting to sleep is the hardest part because no matter what I do I still can’t just shut my eyes and fall asleep(if anyone has any ideas). I don’t really get anxious that much but it has happened before, mainly getting into a problem of depersonalization. It’s really been a struggle especially alone. Sometimes I cry because I don’t know what else to do with myself.

In the moment I thought I was making good memories with friends, but it wasn’t all that. Sure, I had some really good memories high as fuck at my friends, but the bads don’t outdo the goods. 

April 2020 was the last day I got high. This was during my senior year in highschool. I still can’t understand what happened, but I had a severe panic attack out of nowhere while taking a bong rip. I wasn’t even that high, it just came out of nowhere. But ever since that day, my life has been a living hell. 

For the next 5-6 months after my last smoke, I had SEVERE anxiety. Sleeping was nearly impossible since all my body wanted to do was panic. I couldn’t even go on the freeway without my heart racing. I had lost almost all hope and fell deep into depression. Working was nearly impossible since I had zero interest in continuing life. I almost pulled the plug... I’m grateful I didn’t.

Fast forward another 6 months, almost all my anxiety is gone. I get an anxiety attack ever once in a while but they are getting less and less frequent. I still live with a very weird body high that I have had since the panic attack. Too this day I still have no idea what the fuck happened. Why did my body go into this unlivable state out of nowhere. I have been debating on going to a doctor since I still live with some side effects that I didn’t used to. I haven’t even though about smoking once after that incident",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8613747}"

Day 6.,"I (38m) started getting high in 1996 and have been high nearly every day since. I mean YEARS would go by without taking a day off. Occasionally I'd manage to quit for a day, or few weeks or even a month (once) but I always fell right back into it, usually because my mind would play those justification games - you've been such a good boy lately, just a little weed won't hurt, I deserve it. BOOM, back to getting high every day for another year or two or three. Rinse, wash, repeat. 

Recently, I've been going through some really tough personal times - my younger brother passed away, some health issues, some work issues. I was definitely abusing weed to cope, but the depression just started to become too much. It finally came to a breaking point when I got (gently) reprimanded for not being productive enough at work. This caused me to have a minor panic attack, in the middle of which came a moment of clarity, as they say, when I knew at the very core of my being that weed is a net negative in my life. Sure, there've been plenty of good times, but what is worth limiting your human potential over? A few months ago I got a big raise, was I really putting my livelihood at risk for weed? Weed doesn't give a shit about me, so why do I care about it so much? I pay more attention to it than anything else! It was my god, and I bowed before it. As you command, master.

That's when I started talking to myself out loud. Well, I was talking to the weed, but the message was for me to hear: FUCK. YOU. WEED. GTFO of my life. You have no place here. You bring more harm than good. You make me less of a man. Less of a father. Less of a husband. Less of a brother. Less of who I truly am. Fuck less, I want to be MORE. 

Saying the truth out loud was so empowering. I went around my house and picked up every single piece of weedquipment - bong, vape pens, cartridges, batteries, chargers. Everything I owned that had anything to do with weed found its way into a trash bag that found its way into a neighbor's trash can. Then I went for a run and meditated, using 'fuck you weed' as an om (aum? ohm?). 

I came back from my run a changed man. It's now cemented in my brain that I don't get high anymore - its not me. Every other time I've tried to quit was sooooo hard - anxiety, nervousness, headaches, mood swings. But this time there was none of that aside from a slight headache. I'm only about a week in right now, but I couldn't imagine going to the shop to buy some weed because it would be such a betrayal to 'tomorrow me'. I'm doing this because I love myself and I want the best for myself. 'Today me' is now 'tomorrow mes' best friend and is learning from 'yesterday mes' long trail of failed attempts and broken promises.

I wrote this for me, but I'm also writing this for you: be your own best friend, take care of yourself, look out for yourself, because weed doesn't give a flying fuck about you. I've failed so many times I can't even count, but it doesn't matter because today I am succeeding. Regardless of how many times you've failed you must forgive yourself, you must love yourself, and you must protect yourself. Every day is an opportunity to make more good decisions and less bad decisions than the day before. Every day is a fresh start. Every day is a new chance to... r/leaves.

Threw everything out 10 minutes into the high, something I didn’t have the courage to do a month back when I made the decision to quit. 
For people on the edge of relapsing, it just isn’t worth it. For what it’s worth here are all the positives I’ve experienced ever since I quit:

1. Started enjoying food the same way as I did when high. Before- I would only eat/enjoy food when I had the perfect high(stoners rarely get the perfect high)
2. Social anxiety is massively reduced- finally able to chat with my neighbors, have people over, say stories without getting stuck or lost for words. Before- I just convinced myself I was a big introvert and used that as an excuse to not meet anyone. 
3. Going out of the house so much more now, even if it’s just for a drive with music on. Before- I just hated driving, mainly due to the added anxiety that comes with driving high and the guilt associated with it.
4. The biggest one is not planning my day around weed. I wouldn’t do any activity that would keep me away from weed for more than 3 hours. Additionally, Not having enough weed left before I get my next batch would give me even more anxiety. Now I feel like a free bird- out of this deadly deceptive cage.
5. As a father , it made me sick to my stomach knowing I’m raising kids while being high , even if I was a great dad. What kid would look up to a stoner dad? I know I wouldn’t.

That's four years ago today.

When  I started this journey I had absolutely no idea what I was getting  myself into. I thought that life as I knew it was over (and it was!),  but not in the way I imagined it. I always had a vision of what things  would look like 1 year in, 2, 3, etc. But every single time I reach that  milestone, its nothing like I thought it would be, but rather so much  better. I've come to realize the journey is more important than the  destination. While this is a special day for me because of what it  represents, every single ""ordinary"" day from the beginning until now has  been filled with so many little but extraordinary things. That is what  makes this all so special.

When I  was using, I lived the same day on repeat. Wake up, find a way to use  whatever it is I wanted to use, and then use that until I pretty much  had to retreat and repeat it all over again day after day. Life today is  far from that, every day is so much different and each day I learn  through the experiences both good and bad, which is one of the greatest  gifts I have today. I could go on about the material and experiential  things I have had in these last four years but that would only highlight  the differences and not similarities. What I've learned is that nobody  can take away the inside job that I do, that is my recovery. I can lose  everything on the outside in the blink of an eye but it doesn't mean I  have to lose my inner peace.

Today  life is not about a chase, its not about getting ""one more"" of whatever  it is I want. It's about taking a moment to stop and realize all the  wonderful things I do have. To appreciate life as it is and not *how it could be.*  In my using, i loathed what was to come and held on so desperately to a  past that would never come to be again. Today I live in the present  moment, outside of the right now nothing else matters. I'm not perfect  and I have my days where I question if I'm doing the right thing and I'm  on the right path, but despite all that I just keep moving forward.  I've found that if I don't use today and I just keep doing the next  right thing, it will work out.

Today,  I don't have to have everything figured out. I can let things be and  take the journey as it comes to me. Its when I'm truly in the moment and  I reflect back on my past self and how my life was centered around  desperately trying to *escape this moment* I know that I'm on the right path and I'm doing what I need to do.

I  could give you guys so many specifics of do's or don't and highlights  of my journey but I don't think any piece of advice could ever be more  important to me than just not using, no matter what. I know I have  wonderful days and hard days ahead, and I get to experience them clean  and truly live my life to the fullest today because of recovery.

This  is the greatest gift I have ever been given in my life. I wouldn't  trade my experiences for anything, nor would I wish this disease of  addiction upon my worst enemy. I am who I am and today I can love  myself, and because of that I can love you all too, even if you're  strangers on the internet.

Weed makes me feel sick. Not like nauseous CHS symptoms, but when I inhale it it almost feels like its filling every gap in my teeth and making my mouth hurt, it almost gives me the shakes- like makes me feel like my brain is shaking or I am trembling a lot. It disrupts my vision as well, I have to blink over and over again to put something in focus, etc. I do get nauseous in a way that I don't get an appetite. Headaches and like, general neurological discomfort (if that even makes sense.) I smoke every single day but I think it is to the point of smoking myself to sickness. I'll finish a cart in a day and I am never not smoking. I do it to self medicate and drown out a TON of trauma, it has become such a clutch for me though, almost in a way where it triggers my OCD. Like, I cannot sleep without out it or I'll never sleep again, or I convince myself it will help take away all the discomfort of my deep traumas but when I do it, I think I just get so sick and focus on that instead. I just wanted some perspective on where others are at and what you would consider an issue. I guess I do know I am having a problem with it, I just feel isolated because I haven't met many people who have this reaction to it. I am on medication for depression, anxiety, etc and am wondering if weed is messing with it and making me feel this ill.

If you got this far, thank you, lol..I need to quit and I need to face the 10+ years of abuse, trauma, etc that I have not faced and I am grateful for this group.

I  started smoking when I was 15, on and off until I was 20. When I was  20, I started taking prescription medication for my anxiety, and weed became a lot nicer to smoke. I was smoking every day - up to three blunts in a day. It was great. I've never been addicted to anything before this, so it was a  really strange time navigating descent into addiction. The day after my  21st birthday, someone I really, really love died + I was a senior in college + my younger sister was about to have a baby. Naturally, I coped by smoking A LOT MORE.

In 2019, I  moved cross-country to California (...at least half of the reason for this being cannabis-related). Then, I was smoking up to a gram of wax/resin a day. I felt fine. I truly believe it helped me manage my grief and all that I was going through at the time. Eventually, time did the thing, and I became less of an emotional wreck. So sometime in 2019,  I realized my consumption of cannabis was absolutely out of hand, plus living in California, there's no fucking way for a recent recipient of a  Bachelors in Philosophy like me to afford that. I slowly mitigated my consumption. I got my smoking down to just a couple of bowls a night,  but my super high (lol) tolerance from the dabbing days never really went away. I wasn't getting very high, just kind of doing something to comfort myself. I started attending ACA meetings recently, and as a  result, I felt the kick in the ass to actually let it go this time.

SO  DAY THREE - It's hotter than balls here in SoCal, I got the sweats pretty bad, and I called in sick to work today because I just could not fall asleep last night and didn't feel safe to drive this morning. But I  feel it clearing my body, and I'm praying the cannabinoids in my brain start making themselves again sooner than later. I do hear the third day is the worst, so that gives me a lot of hope.

I  am so thankful for this experience and even more grateful for this community.   I'm going to start going to the gym to tire myself out instead of smoking myself to sleep like usual. I am way too hyperactive without the stuff!",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4782234}"

I've had as much of a love-hate relationship with the idea of quitting weed as I have with weed. Which, is redundant? Yes it is! But it is two things after all, the quitting and the not quitting.

I've posted here a few times before. I've struggled with this little plant quite a bit. This time is going okay. I still don't think weed is evil, and I know a lot of you don't either. I'm the one with the problem. What that problem is specifically is as yet unspecified.

I do feel fairly certain that the problem was there before weed and that the depression or lack of focus or shirking of responsibility or whatever, the generally EMOTIONAL problems were there, and are there, and I was self medicating. 

I was a terrible binge drinker as well but I have not had alcohol since last July so that's cool, I am proud of that, that is tangible progress. Alcohol is easier in a way because it is so obviously destructive. You'd have to be pretty nihilistic to say 'what's the harm?' as your body and relationships continue to deteriorate before your eyes.

Weed is not so obvious. I've heard it said that it puts you in stasis. I'm not sure if I agree with that or not. It assumes some sort of progress which we ought to be making and I have to wonder, to what? Maybe that is just my not yet uncannibanated brain talking.

All the same I suppose I prefer to frame the struggle more as one of simple liberation. How can I be free if I am dependent on something? 

I was reading a lot of Jung last time I quit for a while (30 days, woot woot), and I had the slight epiphany of correlating marijuana with the devouring mother. The comfortable womb which becomes a maw and swallows us up again, stifling any potential foray into the world. 

Again there is an underlying assumption of some kind of grand 'progress' being interrupted, which again, I will set aside as a debate too complex to settle at the moment.  The point of the comparison in this case (that of cannabis to the devouring mother archetype) is the realization that something so sweet and comforting can at the same time be sapping your vitality, your life force. 

I hear that siren song still certainly. What a lovely endless melody it endeavors to entice me with. But at the same time I am bored of who I am. Am I destined to repeat the same pleasures over and over? I'd like to think not. I'd like to grow beyond this endless infantile stage, which our sick society encourages in so many ways.

For if it isn't cannabis maybe I'd like to indulge in some Netflix? Or wallow in the greasy pleasure of a sausage McMuffin? No? Certainly a little perusal of today's feed on pornhub would ease the restless empty dread and sorrow. Maybe I should swipe a few potential matches on a dating app? Maybe I should purchase the premium option? Maybe I'll just slouch right here in this chair and scroll through reddit, like some sort of intellectual infant.

Maybe I'll take a walk, despite the fact that I'll be bombarded with more invitations to destroy myself plastered on every available advertisement space as I make my way along the busy city street. It makes you wonder about this place doesn't it. The Buddhists say it's all an illusion. The christians say the devil has this world. 

Sometimes I think progress is just another snare and this myth of personal development another trick to convince you to buy and eat more shit. 

But I do believe in the intelligence of life, or God, whatever you want to call it. That power is in me and wants what it wants. And I think it wants independence. So I have to hold onto my faith, and try to believe that the struggle is leading somewhere. Not to any goal but the cessation of these wasting desires. Liberation.

---maybe this isn't really even a good submission for this sub. I've been so isolated in my den of cannabis I'm not sure who my people are. My first guess for now is that those with this particular struggle might have a similar enough mind to resonate with some of this. Thanks for reading if you did.

Im on holiday now and i find that not smokin is so much easier when away because im constantly distracted and busy doing interesting things, its been 3 days and i already feel vetter, but im sleeping like shit anf waking up every day underslept with crippling anxiety and anger.

Basically the hardest bit for me about staying sober back home in normal times is in the nights/afternoons just chilling at home, i know i cant keep busy ALL the time and distract myself, if im alone for long enough by myself bored i always just end up talking myself into smoking again and almost subconsciously just lie to myself like oh its not that bad.

Does anyone have any tips of tackling those long nights at home where usually youd love to kick back with a fatty. If i dont i just get super anxious by myself and spend the whole night debating whether i should pick up or not and i end up either sad and anxious or high, neither r good. And also waiting doesnt help, its not like when its out of my system i can move on, its a lifestyle and thought process and mindset ive built up in the important development years of my life that revolves around weed, i need to kick it. 

Im gonna be a super successful musician no doubt about it but i need to get over this hurdle to get there,  i can see myself being the person i want to be when im sober but it seems so close but also so hard. I have the potential to change the world around me but cant take the first step.

The thing that helped the most...therapy and a consistent workout routine.  It helped me realize that I was smoking as a way of self medication, which is fine to get through the day, but it didnt help heal whatever aches I had in my brain and in the end it delayed my ability to move past things. Pot is great yet weird because it will tell you whatever you want to make it seem like it’s the best decision you could make. It will tell you that it helps with low seratonin, helps with anxiety, helps with PTSD, helps with being creative/funny/etc, helps with depression....and it does for a time, although for me personally it didn’t help bring me out of a depression or help end the anxiety or help me make friends, or do anything beyond making me not care about this stuff long enough to try to fix anything. Being depressed and anxious didn’t have to be a way of life for me. I’m not saying quitting or therapy or exercising will fix everything or anything, but it could be a good way to find out how to start fixing things if they are able to be fixed.

immediately after ceasing use of an addictive substance you crave it. you crave the effect. this lessens as time goes on. but even a year later you can still remember the effect and have an urge to use the drug. after two years with perhaps just a handful of uses, you still can imagine the urge to use it, but the craving is much much less.  


i'm saying it is a matter of sticking to the plan of quitting and believing in your willpower. smoking weed once after your ""official quitting"" does not imply failure at all. the only thing that matters is continuing on the pass of non-use. after 3 or 4 years of only smoking weed very rarely your addiction will be pretty well gone. i used to crave cigarettes when seeing others smoking them while i was drunk and id have a smoke or two. increasingly that lessened. now i have absolutely no craving for either weed or tobacco in any way. 

i know that doing weed would get in the way of what im doing with my life now, so i see it as a real negative.

So I decided to post here to share my experience in quitting so far. Like many of you it's not my first time trying, but this one is going well so far.

I am 21 (soon 22) and have been smoking daily since my 18 (4-7 joint daily, and mostly haschich cause cheaper and easier to find). 

 Year 2020, thanks to covid, was a tough one. I have been stucked alone in my small lodging for about 2 months, far away from family and friends. The only person I was seeing was my dealer. Legit worst time of my life. I was smoking about 10g weed every 4 days, had no money left for healthy eating. Had a lot of suicidal thoughts and was more zombie than human. I was lost in a (i thought) never ending shit. Thought i fcked up my whole life and could only wait dying. 

Some time went by, survived thanks to social life coming back, but I was still smoking. At least 4 daily. Good thing is I eventually went back to family home in august 2020. But it did not helped me to stop, at all. I tried so many times and failed as many. But what changed 15 days ago is : i found a 3 month exacting job (housekeeping) in a 3* hotel in a fantastic region (lots of tourism around here). 

So I smoked my last one the morning I was leaving home. And I have to say that except for like the first 2 days, I've had so few intense cravings so far. It's incredible like I did not believe this could happend. But the hard work and new place with no contacts to buy or smoke with made it. 

I mean I don't even like the job, but hey i am still working my ass off. Even signed for extra work in a restaurant as a runner. There is no way i could have made this with weed and I am so happy. Bank account have never been so full ( no crazy amounts at all but still great for me and my plans and it should keep on raising if I stay strong !). 

So yeah the point is, if there are some young undisciplined people like me around here, wishing to quit. Maybe you could try to engage yourself in something exacting and exhausting. This way no trouble sleeping, few free time for urges, and money :P 

Weed may have permanent dammage but the addiction (in my case at least) seems to be mental, not physic. Not gonna lie i still smoke cigs (6-7 daily) so the fight ain't over and i am trying now to reduce them (to 0 :D). 

Never felt so good, responsible and myself. If my lazy ass did it, then trust me it is possible :D wishing to all of you best of luck in your journey. And big thanks if you read the whole thing, you'r a brave one <3",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.50304925}"

I am quite new to reddit (at least in the sense of now being more engaged, and seeing as this is my first ever post) - and I am not entirely certain how to start so I guess I just will. 

I have been smoking daily and consistently since probably about 18. Maybe 18-19, it wasn't QUITE as frequent, but basically nearly 10 full years of smoking every single day, every few hours... 

Lately, I just feel like weed is doing nothing for me. I obviously barely get high due to the tolerance.. which ends up having me smoke even more. Just an endless cycle, and I have come to the realization that it's not going to be good for me long term, and I just pray for the day when I am clear minded and sober. Don't get me wrong, I love weed. It has been my crutch for 10 years!!! But I need to get it out of my life, because it is no longer beneficial to me in anyway. Also, my wife and I would love to start trying for a baby soon, and I want to be as absolutely healthy as possible for all that. 

Smoking details: I smoke honestly probably anywhere from every 1-3 hours each day. I usually have 3-4 bong hoots. I also mix my weed with tobacco currently (not to trail off, but this all started as a way to REDUCE the amount of weed..... now I just smoke a whole bunch of both... oof). 

Here is a little update on things I have tried (or thought of) when it comes to quitting: 

\- So first and foremost I know about purging. I have not had the balls to throw away my bong because I justify to myself I spent $ on it.... (as I'm burning $100's a month on the actual weed lol, funny how your mind tries to make justifications). Anyways, purging/cold turkey is for some people. But truthfully, I might struggle with that and just cave all over again. Not sure if this tactic can work for me. 

\- I have tried to do a gradual reduction. Basically I will either take all my current weed and tobacco, separate it into like 7 little tupperwares with gradually less and less amounts, and kind of try to ONLY smoke one container's worth a day... this could work but as of now I just end up diving into container's #2+3 by the end of day one.... typing this all out makes me feel so embarrassed... 

\- Lastly, similar to above \^, I have tried doing like a timed schedule... have a couple hoots every 2 hours, the next day every 3 hours, and so on. 

I guess I don't really know what I am even asking for here besides maybe any different quitting tactics. I supposed I just don't have people or a community with anything similar to this, and I just wanted to get it off my chest and see what other people have dealt with. I just want to quit and be healthy and clear-minded.... for myself, my wife, and my future little baby! And I am struggling..",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5178951}"

I've relapsed twice now, but I can't emphasize enough how much it *doesn't* feel like starting from scratch.   


The first time I quit was after close to a decade of smoking every day. It was a nightmare honestly. At first I thought I had the flu because I couldn't believe withdrawal from something as ""innocent"" as pot could've had that effect on me. Couldn't sleep, couldn't focus, constant headaches, cravings, the worst mood I recall having in the 30 years of my life. I was a wreck of a man for a couple of weeks. Eventually I started to get my shit together and started feeling like myself again.  
Cue the relapse. Lockdown hit me like a ton of bricks, all of my previous activities went out the window when everything started to close. I fooled myself into thinking I could moderate, went about as well as one might expect. Eventually I started therapy, realizing more and more that getting better demanded I quit entirely. Lo and behold, this time it wasn't nearly as painful as I remembered. I had a tough time falling asleep the first couple of days, sure, but I didn't feel sick and depressed like last time. In fact, I started feeling more rested and energetic within a couple of days at most.   
The next time I relapsed it was shorter than last time still. This time it didn't take nearly as long  for me to realize weed wasn't improving any aspect of my life. Better still, I don't feel like I need to go to the gym 7 times a week just to maintain my sober streak. I can actually relax in front of a book or a game without needing to sweat my ass off every night. It's only been a few days but I haven't felt this peaceful in a very long time. I'm sure therapy played a big part in that.

I've been smoking for 12 years so I actually don't remember what is normal mind.

I don't have any cravings to smoke again and the majority of the withdrawal symptoms have gone away and I'm feeling much more fresh than I have in years which I'm excited about.  


The biggest problems I'm facing are that I'm having a very difficult time concentrating on things and being able to connect with my friends.  


I used to love reading and making music but those activities have all but ceased the last few weeks because I feel that I cannot get comfortable and focus the way that I have been able to previously. I have been going on lots of walks and listening to podcasts which have been very helpful but I miss being able to sit down and read a good book or produce music.   


About the second issue,  the majority of my friends are massive stoners whose lives all revolve around smoking weed. Even when I smoked regularly I would get annoyed by their unhealthy lifestyles (I've always exercised and eat very healthy so that has helped a lot during this) and the fact that they didn't want to do anything other than sit and get high and play video games for hours on end. Any activity that we attempt to do together would be interrupted every 30 minutes by having to get stoned. I've been distancing myself from them while I go through the majority of the withdrawals and to avoid any discouragement to quit that they might throw/have previously thrown my way because they are uncomfortable with their own problem.  


I have sober friends but they are very busy and they aren't regularly available. I feel very alone right now in making this change. I've tried to stop in the past and I always end up failing around the two week mark but this time is the most successful and the longest that I've been working toward being sober.  


How do you guys cope with the brain fog and feeling that you don't have anyone to enjoy the sober life with? I'm 30 years old and a year ago I moved back to a country that I have previously lived for a number of years. I love it here but is  known to be notoriously hard for making new friends. I really want to succeed this time and could use some advice on how to push through these hard first few months.",13,{'distancing': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3964033}"

I don’t have it as bad as some of the stories I read here. Although I deal with depression and anxiety (which is the reason I abuse), I have a very comfortable living with lots of travel, friends, and making 6 figures. That makes it all the harder to quit. I’ve been putting off quitting weed for years. I have no problems self-describing as an addict openly.

It’s been 10+ years since I started on a daily basis my sophomore year of college. I know I use it to calm down my anxiety (self medicate). But I also know that it developed as a habit to a level that does me more harm than good. In fact, the low self-esteem (depression) that made me abuse the THC is not even there anymore. But the weed abuse still is and now that is making me depressed.

I’m just too lazy to kick the habit. I do know it’s a problem and I can’t stop. I’ve talked about with my therapist and talk about it with friends. I’ve given all my paraphernalia away including weed multiple times. But I’m smart and have money, so whenever I want some I just get it. It’s like I can’t stop the monkey brain from the dopamine boost.

In the years trying to quit, now is when i’ve had the least motivation to do it yet the most desire and need. I have big dreams and ambitions, but I usually end up in bed or the couch after work. I haven’t worked out in a while but used to on a daily basis. My mind is not fully there - and thus I avoid the social interaction which I actually want. I physically don’t feel good, it creates stomach aches. I’m also not operating at my best mentally - and haven’t for a while. However, since I’m relatively successful I don’t have urgency. Weed is killing me, and it is killing me slowly. 


If writing this is all I do tonight, then at least I got something done that I have been putting off for a very long time. 

I find it warming to read some of the success stories confirms that it is possible. I’ve always wanted to go a month without it. Most i’ve done is 28 days. Anyway, I need some kind of motivation to try quitting seriously again because as of lately I’ve been way TOO comfortable. I need some willpower - how can I restart the willpower?

YOU can do it too!,"So I have some pretty deep rooted family issues, and recently some really heavy stuff came up. At the same time both of my roomies have moved out and I am now looking for people to replace them, leaving me completely alone in a three bedroom house that I had to pay for in full this month. Its been a stressful week!

I was cleaning up around the house to make it more presentable, and found a dram with a bowl or two in it. I thought to myself that it might be nice to take the edge off and just relax with a tiny bit of weed to calm my nerves. I knew it would get me high as hell because I haven't smoked for two weeks. I sat down two nights ago and loaded a small bowl, stared at it for a while, put it up to my mouth and was about to light up.... but I decided it wasn't worth it and emptied the bowl and went to bed feeling like shit. The next day (yesterday) my family issues doubled down and I literally said ""fuck it!"" out loud to myself and went to load that bowl again. Same thing, I was just about to light it up. But I sat for a minute longer and thought about my recent posts here on leaves. I decided that I am stronger than this, and that I can let myself feel the shitty things without the weed. I know for a fact that I would have been bummed about giving in and losing my streak. So I did six solid rounds of the Wim Hoff breathing method instead. Low and behold I fell asleep LIKE A DAMN BABY - with NO WEED. It was my first genuinely good night of sleep since I quit smoking again! I had some pretty awesome dreams and woke up this morning feeling prouder than ever for not giving in.

So here's to day 16! Just thought I would share my experience for those of you who feel that they are about to give in again. If you don't do it you will feel better about yourself and the bad feelings that may be triggering you will pass naturally. You can do it!",10,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.37238318}"
2021-06-14 17:18:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nzxb9u/day_38_of_life_20/,Day 38 of Life 2.0,"I’m almost 40 years old and I started smoking when I was 15. 

I’ve quit for between four and six months about three times in my life since then. 

Whenever I smoke for the first time in a while I immediately want to smoke the next day. 

When I’ve quit before I typically drop into a depression a month or two out, then I smoke again and it gives me tremendous energy and enthusiasm and jump starts me out of the depression.

Right now I’m in the middle of that depression period, but I have a new mentality to see this through. That doesn’t mean it’s easy; at all.

I was always one of those highly productive stoners. Get stoned play sports. Get stoned launch companies. Get stoned get straight A’s through undergrad and graduate school. Burn out, quit, regroup, get stoned, continue. Family guy. High achiever. Tech bro.

Now I’ve hit a different point in my life where I’m starting to plateau. I’m not 25 anymore and I’m not full of energy. I think it’s the weed. I think I drink too much coffee.

My journey started 38 days ago. I went out with some buddies for a birthday blast and ended up vomiting in the toilet that night from mixing tequila shots and beer. I woke up the next day, couldn’t eat, and decided to stop drinking coffee and alcohol and stop smoking weed - let the reformat begin.

I decided that coffee and weed were limiting me and that I wanted to achieve greater outcomes during life. I could feel the stall and I could feel the normalcy binding me through habit. I could sense that paranoia and dissatisfaction were becoming normative and that my personal emotional and relationship development was completely stalling out, or even more terrifying, regressing.

Don’t get me wrong, I was still doing my high achieving thing, but I wasn’t enjoying it any longer and I realize that I wasn’t really achieving internally; I was projecting achievement built on a base of mediocre self esteem.

I’m rambling, but hear me out.

One of the recurring thoughts that finally got me to quit recently was that I didn’t want to die without having a period in my life where I had a clear mind for an extended period of time. I didn’t want to live the vast majority of adulthood being on drugs.

This still motivates me today even though I’m sitting on the couch with a slight headache, dark bags under my eyes, an achy set of muscles, and only enough motivation to wander between the bathroom and kitchen and a few zoom calls to make it look like I’m working today. 

So much for that high achiever. 

Now I’m a struggling human going through self-imposed rehab feeling depressed and reaching out on anonymous Internet thread desperate for psychological and emotional support. 

I’ve been vigorously exercising most days and that has been helpful. However, I always entered this depressive state after about four weeks. Does anyone else have experience with this and what can be done besides exercise to get through it? 

Also, how long does it last? Is it coffee? Is it weed? I’m having a tough time disaggregating the compounding affects of this I’ll paired combo.

I’m about a month into my ‘leave’ after smoking basically nonstop for a decade thanks in large part to this sub, seeing everybody braving the storm encouraged me to be better and I’m forever thankful. 

I have noticed some interesting changes, after the first hell week of barely any eating and sleeping I found that I couldn’t eat spicy foods as much anymore. I always grew up eating everything spicy, I used to throw sriracha and other chili sauces on everything I could, but now it gives me crazy stomach pains for hours so I have to really limit them in my diet which is unfortunate. I’ve also found that I’ve developed a strong lactose intolerance which is such a shame because I love dairy. I was wondering if these symptoms have happened to anyone else and if they persisted or diminished over time?

I’ve also found that I get extremely sleepy sometimes, I know my body is healing and my brain is rewiring itself to a new homeostasis but it’s frustrating. I’m going on long walks and exercising more to try and increase my stamina but I’m always taking naps afterwards and now wondering when I’ll get back to having regular energy levels throughout the day again. 

I’m also interested in hearing about your changes and experiences, thanks for your time everyone!

TLDR; I can’t eat spicy foods and dairy 1 month into my leave, also wondering if I’ll ever stop being so sleepy all the time?

It’s hard for me to start exercising while I’m in withdrawal bc I just feel tired all the time. Sweating it out without having to workout has been great. Just make sure you drink a ton of water before and after, you don’t want to get dehydrated. I usually have BAD night sweats when I quit but this time they have been minimal bc of all the day sweating. Also it feels great and relaxing while still being productive towards quitting. 

-your attitude is EVERYTHING! I feel myself start to spiral down every once in awhile and I have to tell myself it’s just my body craving marijuana, nothing more. It’s just a chemical imbalance. I’m okay and it’s going to pass. Sometimes it doesn’t pass for awhile but eventually those dark moments ALWAYS do. I even laughed at myself a little today because I went from laughing to crying in like a minute. Just expect your body to be riding waves for a few days. Let them wash over you, good and bad. Know that it’s going to pass. 

-get some new rituals. Not even to replace weed directly, you just need something else consistent in your life. Mine has been coffee. Every morning without fail I get up, get coffee, journal, and chill. Having that ritual makes me feel good even thought it’s just a small thing. 

-Read the scary stuff about weed. Idk, maybe that’s kinda dark, but I need those intense reminders that this stuff is not good for me. I used to love weed but for god’s sake, it’s not worth dying early. Look at the scary pictures of lungs. Look at the posts from people who feel they lost 30 years of their lives. The people saying weed isn’t that bad are just people who haven’t gotten far enough into it to know the truth. Don’t listen to those people. And know that after looking at all the scary stuff, you can heal! The body is amazing that it can heal itself and it will, but you HAVE to stop so it can.

I think one of my biggest triggers is a fear of negative emotions. Once I start feeling sad, anxious or upset, I feel an almost overpowering urge to run away from the feeling. The weekend was easier because I could avoid situations and people that tend to bring out these feelings in me. But I work in the bad place. It's going to happen at some point, I just don't know when. 

Longer term, I'm working through a meditation course and trying to practice mindfulness. I've been reading a lot about theories of emotion and emotional regulation. I'm on the spectrum and I've found some related self help materials on learning to identify what I'm feeling and what the purpose of these feeling are. All that just to say I'm actively working on the problem, but it's not a quick fix. I'll get there, but I'm not there yet. 

So when my coworker acts as a catalyst for panic, anger and fear, and my first instinct is to order weed, how do I stop myself from acting on it?

When I meet new people I can become very quiet which probably makes them think I'm pretty weird but realistically I'm just too tired to process their words and engage in conversation. Because of this I've also created distance between goods friends just because lack of energy.

I was told by a stoner that weed makes you sleep but its not a good quality/restful sleep.

When I don't smoke I also cant sleep.

How TF did I get here,"Started smoking when I was 19 to help deal with a lifetime problem of insomnia. Now, 7 years later, I've smoked pretty much every day. I smoked through engineering school with a 3.9 GPA, because weed was helping me keep a normal sleep cycle and my life was together and on track. For a long time, I genuinely think it helped me keep my shit together and kept me from doing crazier and more impulsive stuff when I was manic. 

But now...now I just feel stuck. The lockdown had me working from home and I smoked my way through the whole thing. I'm back at the office, but I spend every sober day at my desk watching the clock and waiting to go home and get high. I feel generally happier and healthier when I'm sober, and I LIKE the way I feel when I'm sober, but there's this constant voice in the back of my head reminding me that weed exists and if I just get high the voice will go away. I hate spacing out and losing hours at a time to nothing. I hate feeling like I'm fighting my way through a brain fog just to formulate an idea. I hate feeling like my personality is on mute and like I'm not interesting, because I'm too fucking high to have an involved conversation. 

If I could cut back to smoking only at night, before I go to bed, that would be a good place to start. I don't want to stop smoking completely, because I genuinely love it *when it is contrasted with my normal life*, but this state of being where being high IS normal life just sucks. I want to be a casual smoker, who has a good time at concerts and enjoys the high BECAUSE of how different it feels when compared to my normal mindset. But who I am now, this boring smoke weed every day stoner lump, this isn't the person I want to be.

I don't know if I smoked everyday all day because I was a college student who wanted to have fun or because I wanted to numb the pain I experienced over the years. I think it was probably a combo of both. I got along fine thru life and had a really cushy career at a well-known company. Then shit truly hit the fan the past few years. Over 3 years my wife had severe depression, dad got cancer, wife attempted suicide, dad's cancer returned after beating it, and to top it all off, I got illegally detained by police in front of my own home for mistaken identity. Dad beat cancer but got remarried and I realized I hadn't truly processed my parents divorce for 10 years. You all know who I turned to push all this in the back of my mind. 

I continued using despite going to therapy and getting help, I weened myself down to a couple puffs from a joint per day, but could never make that last final step because I couldn't face everything I'd gone thru and I was afraid to lose part of my identity.

I don't drink often, usually like once every two weeks, but I'll have a decent amount when I do, like maybe a bottle of wine or around six drinks.  When I was smoking chronically/all the time, my hangovers, from alcohol, would be unbearable, I would vomit the day after drinking, my entire body would sweat, my head would hurt so much - seriously, it would knock me out like nothing else. Usually, if I drank one night, the next day would be ruined and I wouldn't feel okay until the next day, or until I smoked which would usually help with at least the headache. After quitting weed, on day 30 now, I find my alcohol hang overs are almost non existent. I have them, but barely. Last night I had some rum and a bottle of wine with friends. Previously, I know I would have vomitted from that, and it would have been a rough day, but now, after not smoking for a month, I barely had a headache. I notice the drinking impacts my sleep, as in I'm tired the next day, but that's pretty much it besides a light headache which went away after a few hours. Has anyone had this experience?

She works long, erratic shifts, and she came home at 3 in the morning to me in my bed playing a game, high. I've been smoking for \~three years, and she's known for a little over a year and a half that I smoke, but she's never seen me high. She sat on my bed and lingered, I knew she knew, but I didn't want to make eye contact just in case she didn't know. I tried ignoring her, hoping she would just go away, but she didn't.

""You're stoned aren't you""

""Yeah""

She looked at me, I could see the disappointment. I stared back. I didn't like the confrontation, no one had ever called me out like that before. People had noticed before, but it was always either a playful acknowledgment or would follow with ""Let me get some."" She was I think the first person to call me out with disappointment. I had always felt a bit of shame or regret when I smoked initially, but over time that feeling mostly went away. I still tried to hide it the best that I could, I would walk blocks away just to smoke so that my sister or anyone else wouldn't notice. I didn't want any judgement, I just wanted to smoke and stay in my room all night, watching videos and playing games, like I had been for years at this point. My mom came in, and I had a really uncomfortable conversation with her, and I was frustrated just having it.

""Does it make you feel good?""

""I don't want to have this conversation right now""

""Do you need it?""

I hadn't lived with her for years. She had moved to a different city nearby, and I was with her for a bit, but the commute to school and work was too far, so I moved around a lot, from my sister's apartment to my grandma's to my ex's house... I've lost count of how many times I moved back and forth from all those places. She rarely saw me during this time as I was busy with school and work, and I didn't make much time to go see her. My sister eventually bought a house and I was able to finally have my own room with her, and I've been here since she got it a year ago. My mom recently moved in with us, looking to save a bit of money to buy a house of her own. Even though she works all the time, she has been able to see me more consistently. She still had a pre-weed idea of me in her head.

""You need to stop. It's affecting you and you don't see it. I grew up around it, my brothers always had it, and when they weren't high, they were angry and frustrated. I see the same thing in you. This isn't you.""

She can be pretty over bearing and frankly annoying at times, and it was difficult to hear what she was telling me, but she had a perspective the people around me didn't have. She knew it was negatively affecting me, she saw the change in me that other people didn't. I think on some deeper level I knew it was negatively affecting me too, but I never had someone tell me to my face before so I was able to just ignore that guilty, but overall correct feeling.

Day two!,"I have smoked every single day for five or six years. Since that first hit, weed has been enmeshed in my life, my identity, and my relationships. I smoked every single chance I got and, looking back, I can't believe the things I normalized in my head; getting high during lunch breaks at work or, shamefully, while driving. I prided myself on silly things, like being a really tiny guy but being able to take the biggest dabs or being able to outsmoke all my friends. I even worked in the cannabis industry (which is honestly a nightmare, but that's another story). 

About six months ago, I realized I was just smoking for the hell of it. The magic of weed was long gone and there was no intent or purpose. I was just smoking because *that's what I do*. I kept on smoking because maybe I was just in a weird headspace. I told myself it would pass. 

About three months ago, a switch flipped in my body. Every time I smoked, I would feel panicked and anxious. I remember taking a small dab and being overcome with the worst anxiety I had ever felt. I had to lay down and could not move my body -- it felt like I didn't even have one. It threw me into a horrible trip, cold sweats and thought loops galore. I have done more than weed and used to say, ""I'm great at drugs!"" because no substance ever made me feel like I was losing control. I was always grounded and composed to some degree. To think that weed was going to be what broke me felt absurd. But it did. 

After that, I decided I was going to take a small step back and lower my intake. I was only sharing a bowl with my girlfriend at night. It was... fine. That was it. Just fine. It was doing absolutely nothing for me. It sank in that weed wasn't fun for me anymore. My body had been telling me this for months and I just now decided to listen. I am on day two and already feel clearer and with more motivation. I'm already planning on jumping back into the hobbies that had slowly taken a backseat to smoking. 

It feels bittersweet. Weed had helped me *a lot* and very much served its purpose. It opened me up to perspectives I probably would not have experienced otherwise and taught me so much about myself and the world. I won't ever disavow the benefits weed has shared with me, but in the same breath, I also won't deny that it has made me so complacent and stunted. This is not a harmless plant, it just makes you unable to realize what it is slowly robbing you of. I used to write all the time, but now I can't remember the last time I sat down to work on a creative project. 

It almost feels like a break up. You create memories with this substance and want to hold on to how it *used* to make you feel, but you know you're much better off on the other side. I think the hardest part is letting go of the ritual that comes with weed; rolling, packing a bowl, grinding the it. Those were small, but comforting, everyday things. Then I remember there's a whole world out there and new, healthier, more fulfilling rituals can be found. My body has made it clear that it is done with weed. That fact may be difficult for my mind, my ego, and the identity I've built around it, but I am allowed to shed my skin when something no longer serves me. I was terrified of how I would feel even just one day sober, but I'm two days in and it's honestly not scary at all.

I used to bunk my tuitions just to sit around and drink and smoke cigarettes. 2010 my school results had come and I had passed with bare minimum marks. My single mother found something fishy going around as she used to find cigarette smell on my clothes and sometimes even alcohol. Finally she decided to put me up in a boarding school for my final years of schooling days. It was a jail. You can't go out and you had to be inside the campus all the time just to sit and study. Finally I finished my schooling and found a university and appeared for it with a basic BBA degree. 3 years of college life it went good but in my second year I was a full time stoner. We used to roll joints smoke bongs everyday. Like- 

9am was the college so, 

8:30am- Get up and get ready. Wake n bake. 
10:30am - short break at the university- smoke up
1:00 am- lunch break - don't eat lunch smoke up.
And after the college ends at 5pm. - Full time smoking up at random guys house till you can't smoke another doobi. 

2015 I graduated and I wanted to study further for a competitive exam in all level. - ( Just a basic info it's one of the toughest exmas) 

My mother as usual helped me enroll in one of the best coaching center to help me study and make it come true. --- but what do I do. I start to smoke up again and continue the same routine. Even upgraded to hashish. Finally in 2019 I was back home and totally broken because I never studied  hard to clear the exam and all my mom's hardwork was in vain. 

Finally 2021. - Relocated and doing my MBA. Scoring good. And haven't touched the greens since 3 months now. 

I only hope to do well this time because this is my last chance. I'm 28 yo now.

First month was hell. No sleep. Sweaty bed. Fucking angry and moody. Insane crawings. 

After three I started to feel my own self, but still moody. No more night-sweats. If I smelled weed outside I'd want some. 

Six months before I felt like things were back to normal and no mood swings. Smelling weed outside was nothing - just meh. 

Then from six to nine I started feeling like I had surplus energy. I smelled someone smoking outside and was shocked that my first thought was that it smelled disgusting. 

Now it's been a year without a single puff. No regrets. I'm actively working out almost every day. Got promoted at work. More energy and able to be present with my daughter. More energy for my wife. Focused and working towards a better future for me and mine.


My next post will be a year from now when I reach the two year mark. Not a chance in hell I'll buckle now.

I started smoking when I was 12 or 13. After first months I got into weed daily. At start I was only a user. When I reached 16 I went to distributing and did it for solid 3 years. I was moving a lot and smoking even more but on the other hand I was still doing good in high school. I finished it with really good grades and got into college, I started playing organ in the church. Life was actually pretty good. I had a lot of friends. But I was experiencing panic attacks and depression so I stoped smoking at the age of 20. I solidly didn't smoke for 6 months than relapsed for 2 days than didn't smoke for 3 months and relapsed for 4 days again. Now im on week 3 of sober days.
Why am I writing this is because after all this 'trying to quit' period things have gone kinda south. I dropped out of college, lost a lot of friends and my depression has gone far worse.... The question is why doing the right thing is making things worse... I just wanted to see what you all think 😩",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47757554}"

A few months ago, I wrote about getting accepted into med school and how fantastic my life was without weed.

Unfortunately, I relapsed about 5 weeks ago. Things were going great! I was going to gym a lot, working loads, saving loads, feeling absolutely amazing about myself!

Then I started romanticising weed and justifying using again. Thinking things such as "" When I start medical school, I'll never get a good opportunity to smoke, so now's the best time!"" ""A little joint won't hurt."" ""This spliff will definitely enhance playing video games and sex.""

And so I gave into temptation and picked up. Tbh, the first joint felt amazing. I was so relaxed. I didn't rush and smoke too much too quickly. The next night, the euphoria was slightly diluted, but still felt great. I smoked about 4 times that week. Eventually, I smoked a night before I had work early the next morning, and I really felt it. That horrible lethargic, tired feeling. The brain fog. I wasn't able to fully concentrate. I remembered how much I didn't miss that.

Yet I still smoked. I slowly realised that every time I smoked with someone, our conversation rate would drop drastically. We'd almost get stuck in our heads and overthink things. ""Is this too stupid to say?"", ""What if they don't find it funny?"", ""Am I laughing weird?"" Weed was starting to increase my self doubt and I hated it. Yet I still smoked. It was until I finally smoked alone and had a mini anxiety attack. My brain was running at 100mph. My thoughts were racing, and I couldn't control it. I started thinking things like ""I'm so ugly"", ""I look really dumb"", ""Why am I wasting my life on this?"".

That night, I realised how crappy I felt about myself. I sometimes have self doubt, but I'm usually able to think critically and rationalize my thoughts back to normality. Weed either halts this process or slows it down big time. The last thing I need is a drug fuelling my anxiety. I decided to nip it in the bud (badum tss) and give up smoking again. 

It's been 3 weeks since my anxiety attack and I'm feeling awesome! I'm back in a work, gym, relax routine and I learnt that weed isn't for me anymore. I no longer get the long lasting thrill that I used to have. I'm really not missing out on anything. Things that I enjoy sober, feel different on weed. Not necessarily better... Just different. 

Questions I ask myself to help stay sober. Do I need weed to:

- Enjoy a hot summers day?

- Enjoy a walk in the park?

- Have better sex?

- Make a movie better?

- Enhance video games?

- Enjoy a succulent Chinese meal?

The answer is **always** no. I will always love this things anyways!

If my friends are smoking weed around me, I think im getting secondhand high and ill convince myself I am and start getting delusional.

I apologize for this post being so long, and I might be all over the place too. I’ve smoked daily and heavily for the last three years. Today, it’s been two weeks since I smoked my last blunt or cartridge. Yesterday, I officially threw away my weed supplies and leftover weed. Two weeks ago, I got the news that I have to start medication for my Lupus. The medication can be hard on the lungs with some people, and I can't be smoking cigarettes and weed both, so I gave up weed and the cigs are almost gone. I do have a 3% nicotine vape pen that I use, but I think I’ve done surprisingly well. I’ve used that as my drive to quit. Not only that, for the last few months I’ve been struggling with my dependance on weed. I knew deep down it was making some of my problems worse but, I just couldn’t admit it. I was one of those that thought it was the cure all for everything. Sure, it helped my chronic pain from Lupus and Fibromyalgia...but for me, I see now that pain relief wasn't worth the severe anxiety/depression that weed was causing.  

I have been able to get clean from other substances that I was addicted to except for weed. Weed is easily accepted because most don’t realize the dangers of it. I used to think I couldn’t get addicted to it, however, it become such a terrible mental and emotional addiction for me. I stumbled upon you all here one day and I joined for the heck of it. Then I started reading how some of you were saying weed was making your anxiety and depression worse or was causing mood swings that you never had before. I thought it was bull. Even my therapist told me that she felt weed was exaggerating my issues. Anytime I was having an anxiety attack I would reach for my vape pen or a blunt. Sure, it helped that in the beginning. Every time I smoked; I would overthink. I was always overthinking about the stressful things going on in my life and I now know weed was most certainly making it worse. Stress and anxiety were also causing my pain to be worse. In addition to that, weed caused me to have crazy mood swings. I became someone that I didn’t even know anymore. I blamed the mood swings and extreme anxiety on stress from work or college. I had mood swings so bad that it physically wore me out.  

Yesterday, I noticed how two of my friend's anxiety didn’t get worse until they started smoking weed regularly. They fully believe it’s helping, even after I told them it’s more than likely making it worse. They both answered me by saying even if they don’t smoke for a few days, they still have bad anxiety. You’re not going to notice a difference in a few days. I’m not saying my mental/physical health issues are going away entirely after quitting, What I am saying is, finding new ways to help my anxiety, depression and pain has been the best solution for me. After two weeks not only can I see the difference, but my family can also. I don’t miss waking up with a stomachache from passing out after raiding my kitchen due to munchies. I have even started losing weight—that's a good thing for me. I don’t miss running around on my days off work to get weed. I don’t miss spending my hard-earned money on weed or cartridges either. I don’t miss passing out at night and not being able to concentrate on my homework. Even my dog wants to be around me more and that’s probably due to me not smelling like a big bud of weed constantly. I enjoy the happiness and calmness that has started to peak back into my relationship--my boyfriend has sure noticed a change as well. It’s nice to not wake up coughing like crazy too. I dreamed last night for the first time in years. It was a bad dream, and I even woke up to sit up in my bed to catch my breath. I knew that I would suffer from some bad dreams once dreams started coming back. Even though it was bad, I was happy that I dreamed. I didn’t realize I missed dreaming so much. I can concentrate better on homework also!  

I guess I’m writing this in hopes my words will help someone. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy or that you’re going to see a change overnight, but I can say with patience I’ve noticed a pretty big change in myself after only two weeks quitting. You all here and therapy have been the biggest help. My therapist, Rheumatologist and PCP have been working together to help me discover new ways to manage my pain better. They also have been great with helping me manage the anxiety/depression that I initially had when I started smoking weed. I’m more confident and in a better mindset without weed to face my physical and mental health problems head on. I had to go through two other therapists to find the right one for me. I know seeing a therapist/doctor isn’t a choice for some people, due to a variety of reasons. So, if you ever need someone to reach out to, I’d be happy to talk to you.

I’ve seen many people in here say that you need to distance yourself from your stoner buddies in order to be successful, and unfortunately for me, my “stoner” buddies are my best friends in the whole world.

So I decided to send them a group message laying out exactly how I feel about my relationship with weed, and that I want to quit and I need their support. I was met with the love and support that I knew these guys would give as they are some of the best homies one could ask for. 

The biggest thing for me is accountability, whenever I try to quit I usually don’t tell anyone, so that if I fail and start smoking again, no one is there to question me, but this time, all my friends know and if I hit a weak moment, they are there to help me out. 

So in short I would say don’t feel like you have to cut friends out of your life because they smoke weed and you want to quit. Take some time to really tell them how you feel (i.e. write them a r/leaves post style message) and go forward based on their response. You might even find some of them have been feeling the same way. If they support you and care about you they will be your biggest asset towards your success, if not, well then they must not have been very good friends and your probably better off without em anyways.

2021-06-13 13:01:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nz0s6q/smoking_weed_for_14years/,Smoking weed for 14years.,"I’ve been smoking weed since I got into high school (14 years old) and it all started between friends on a pretty much regular basis. 
I always used to smoke, every day, with friends, at parties or alone at home. 
I’ve been in England for 7 years now. Weed here it’s so accessible and only a phone call away. 
Three years ago my heart got broken by a person that I was very much in love with and since than, the amount of weed smoking doubled if not tripled.
I finally choose to stop! 
Tomorrow will be one week since I’m weed free. I’ve been through hell and back for the first 5 days, sweeting, vomiting, not being able to eat or sleep and my body could barely move. Now I’m starting to feel better and I’m so thankful for that! 
Because I’m pretty much a introvert, I’m not going out often and most of the time I’m at home alone ( witch is okay with me) I do have a handful of friends but now I realised that all my friends are smoking weed and when we meet, that would be something that we regularly do ( we had activities but weed was like water, everybody drinks water!) 
I have two friends that I’m really close with and talk on the phone almost every day. Obviously they smoke every day, the same way I used to. I’ve let them know everything I went through this week and they could see me how weak I was but that didn’t stop them to ask me to hang out and smoke, go out for the weekend and smoke and drink, sending me pic with the weed they both or smoking while we video chat.
I’m not sure what to think about all this. They are my close mates and we always supported each other and help each other in need. But since this week I’m not sure how I feel about their behaviour. I tried to explain them that it’s hard for me right now to be around people that smoke weed. I don’t think I’d be capable now to say NO if someone offers me weed and if I’d think that’ll be only a puff, it’s not going to be only a puff..
I really feel alone in this situation and I don’t know what should I do in this ….
As I said, all my mates are smoking weed and this two are my closest ones. If I cut this friendships out of my life, my mum will be the only person that I’ll have left to talk ( and I can’t really talk everything I’m going through with my mum).
I specifically made an account here in the hope of getting a little support or advice from people that might have been or is in the same situation as me.

So naturally I was in a lot of emotional distress and in a lot of pain and I gave in and started smoking. I met someone that works at a dispensary that I would hang out with, so I then got pulled right back into the cycle of smoking every single day all day, wasting tons of money, and time and energy on just smoking. It became a part of every day life again. If I wanted to eat, I'd smoke, go to work I'd smoke. So I've been reflecting a lot on that month I was sober, I was really starting to have momentum again in life, I started paying attention to what I eat, drinking water, making myself breakfast every day, read, listen to podcasts, track new habits, spend more quality time with my daughter. I was building routine and structure into my life. Im learning for me it's a limiter on my capabilities. So with all of this said, today is day 2 of quitting again.  I've packed up all my weed stuff and given away a lot as well. Its time to take back control of my life.

My name's Joe. Since March, I was sober a month, then relapsed a month. Here's the thoughts keeping me up all night til the sun rises...
Staying away from weed in one of probably the top 5 stoner states is hard. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else but yeah, I think my city of choice might legitimately have more pot shops than gas stations. It's an extremely liberal area. Anyway.
(Sorry, forewarning this turned out very long... many topics so no tldr.)
Sober date 6/1/21.

Hi, my name's Joe and I'm a marijuana addict.
Feeling sick of this. Sick of wishing away my addiction. Sick of my actions that haven't been in line with my values. Sick of mistreating those I love.

I can't sleep. Thinking of my regrets. Who I've let down. Who I've disappointed. Who I wish I were with right now - but they're upset with me. I want nothing more than to be by their side every day - but they let me go, and may most likely not reinvite me into their life again.

Because
1. I'm not myself when I'm high. I suck.
and
2. Smoking weed has disastrous mental health complications for me that affect people close to me.

Therefore, they (rightfully so) don't want to be subjected to watching me self-sabotage, Over and Over and Over. It's too hard on them to witness my life, my personality, happiness, any and all light inside me being slowly snuffed out by... Me. My potential all going to waste while I do nothing but sit around smoking weed all day...

Side rant -
Is that the saddest thing about stoner addicts like us? Instead of going out with a bang, it's out with a whimper? Instead of a disastrous, dumpster-fire spectacular burn-out explosive end of a life, we just slowly, steadily... puff, puff, pass away? Oftentimes becoming complacent with completely and utterly mediocre lives? Technically when I'm an addict yes I'm still a living human being, but my soul, my essence, my personality, what makes me ME, is dead. I'm more like some sort of fleshy robotic smoking appliance. Stationed in one spot, inhaling and exhaling repeatedly, numb to everything, no thoughts, no emotions, no goals, no desires... 

So when I relapsed, they asked me to essentially leave their life. Again. I can't blame them...

But I do blame MYSELF. And my difficulty/stubbornness in learning from my mistakes.

I do know I've accepted by now (relapse #4) that I *do* need help, and professional help. It's not a bad thing, just a fact. I need help in order to create a sober life for myself. This is the ground zero fact. Here are some other things I need to *fully accept* for any progress to occur in my life and which evidence has determined are other true facts for me when it comes to weed and my life:

1. I can't casually smoke it. Because I can't moderate myself. I always, ALWAYS end up becoming a ""oh, well I'm just ending my day like this to relax"" smoker, then ""lots of people end *every single day* with a drug of some kind..."", and then ""eh I didn't have anything to do today anyways, I can smoke today"" smoker...
Once it's daily, it only snowballs from there...
 ""hmm uhhh, I can leave that task for later, I'm off to go smoke..."" *pushes EVERYTHING off... INDEFINITELY*
And then the several-times-a-day-everday-stoner.
Finally, the Final Boss: Wakes-n-bakes-n-never-puts-it-down,-spends-all-my-money-,-literally-smokes-myself-out-of-house-and-home, straight-up, would-actually-do-Anything-for-it-if-and-when-the-situation-gets-dire... Marijuana Addict.

Which brings me to the second truth:

2. I'm not a functional stoner. Some people can smoke all day, go to work, live life, etc. I can't. I would if I could. Clearly. I've been trying ANY way I could to make it work since 2018. Well, the 3 years of research is in: I fucking can't. I will NEVER make it work.
Tuff Tiddies.
The sooner I can accept that weed's NOT *EVER* in the cards for me, the better.

If I want any sort of control of my own life, then smoking weed needs to be as unfathomable of an activity/option for relaxation to me as, I don't know, going for a jog in the middle of a busy freeway in all black clothes at midnight? Taping all the individual strips of bacon from a package to myself and jumping into the lion's den at the zoo? Tying some lead balloons to my ankles and walking off the river dock in the dead of winter? Etc. Actually, having these pictures in mind may be a good tactic for the future, because it really is a suicide mission for me to smoke weed and it's crucial for me to remember this... In times of temptation or strife, I need to remember how for me, it will ALWAYS be that smoking weed --> addiction --> institutions and death. Any tips that help with remembering this, please, I'd love to hear your comments letting me know what's worked for you guys, don't be shy. I feel like I keep getting a better picture of what works to keep me sober and living life, but it's also hard for me to see my forward progress when I recently relapsed and did stupid shit that I've been doing for years. So it's a bit dejecting that my last sober stretch before this was only a few days more than a month.

Smoking has shown time and time again to ALWAYS lead to me become honestly the Saddest, Laziest, Boringest, most Dimwitted, Messiest version of myself that is unlikable, unreliable, uncreative, unmotivated, and uninteresting. That everyone is constantly disappointed with me and sad about.

It ruins - no, *I* ruin my life *with* it, everytime I try it. Without fail.

In those 3 years, I've relapsed a handful of times. Probably going, on average, 2 months sober between relapses. I think my longest stretch was maybe 4 months at a time? (Outside of a controlled environment where it was impossible to smoke). If I broke down the last 3 years' time into percentages, I'd estimate possibly... 20% sober time, 40% in active addiction, and 40% residing in a psych ward. Not pretty.

It's getting fucking old. I'm sick of being caught in this cycle. Quitting has, 4 times now, resulted in my going to a residential psychiatric inpatient ward. For a minimum of around 50 days the first time, and, no joke, 130 days this latest time, Nov 1 2020 - Mar 12 2021. That's a little over a third of a year...... 

I don't want weed to hold me down and control me anymore. My actions, my wallet, my presentability, my relationships, my physical and mental health. They're all at their worst when I trade real life for weed. And all the relationships I make with stoners disappear faster than a puff of smoke dissipating outdoors on a windy day, because they're all incredibly shallow, insubstantial relationships. 99% of the time the only thing we have in common is getting high...

That's not who I am. I don't want that to be all there is to me. I know I have things to offer and friends to make and places to visit and people to help and stories to share and new stories to hear and new music to hear and *life to experience*.

I want to be my own, whole person without marijuana SO bad. I need it. I need my life! I need to take it back from the cavernous jaws of my beast of marijuana addiction, drop a live grenade in, duct-tape its mouth shut, throat-kick it and collapse its larynx so it asphyxiates. I need to show it who's boss. I need to stop feeding this beast just to keep seeing if I can keep it as a pet... I can't. I can't domesticate it. It will always be hungry no matter how much I feed it, and only grow stronger and stronger until it inevitably eats me alive. Everyone who knows me keeps seeing this... It's evident. It's obvious. It should be all I can see when I look at it, and no matter how I look at it - I'm not qualified to live with this beast. I just want to be free of it and put it/me/us out of misery...

I want to be happy. I want to have money to spend on what I REALLY want in life. I want to have my own back and take care of myself, because I believe that I deserve that, and also so that the people that love me aren't constantly worrying sick about me...

I'll have 2 weeks on Monday but I don't feel any pride or accomplishment... I'm just feeling tired. Exasperated with myself. Fed up. Sad.

If you read this far, you're awesome and every day, hell, every hour you don't smoke and you add to your sober time... in my stoner addict eyes, you're performing a miracle. Seriously. I don't know how to do it. But I'm trying to be hopeful that it's not impossible for me. I'm getting an addiction counselor for the first time hopefully very soon. I've been moderately depressed lately but it felt good to write about it all. Thanks for reading.

I only smoked no edibles and wax and stuff tho. I loved every blunt I rolled , joints cigars , backwoods and bongs and pipes. I started smoking when my grandmother and granddad passed in the same year in 2010 of my junior year. I surrounded myself with all stoners and I built friendships based on how much they smoked for we could match and/or go half on some smoke. I used to spend mostly all my money on weed and cigars that i never really kept any on me at all. So that kept me from advancing in life for a long time. Fast forward to now, I stopped smoking completely after i had a scare with what I thought was covid19 but was just heart palpataions which had me really thinking about life and all and was told i should stop smoking. I was also smoking Black N Milds also heavily so that also contributed to it also. Before this happened I was thinking about quitting because i was not getting high like i used to and it felt as though I have reached a wall of sorts or the final tier of a fortnite battle pass. I was using weed as an escape from feeling the pain of death and heartbreak and i didnt want to feel anything at all after awhile. I now face all of my emotions head on now with a clear mind and feel better at dealing with it now. I know im just going on and on with stuff but long story short you can stop doing anything you want to when you have a good enough reason. Just think of all the things you can do with the extra money and Headspace you have after quitting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- First experience was with a 5mg edible about a year after my father died. I was 22. Felt like an electric shock hit me, and I loved it. I felt a rush of the affection and (self) acceptance that I deeply craved.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- Casual user for around a year after that. Moved to a place where it was completely legal. Began getting stoned 2 or 3 times per week, usually around 25mg to 50mg edibles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- New job, but stopped studying. Self-worth declined. Couldn't see a pathway out of my situation. Lots of stress and terrible management. Became a heavier user, almost daily. Moved away from friends. Spent around $500 a month. Completely lost. Would sit on the balcony smoking and contemplating jumping off, figured I was only a few months away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- Got a girlfriend, who helped me immensely, but she was also somewhat unmotivated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Then I said screw this... In high school I was smart. I was meant to go places. I have a university degree, and I could get into almost any masters program if I want to. I used to be attractive... Now I'm fat and look tired all the time - I need to change this. I need to find out where these negative feelings come from and find healthy ways to address this.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- I got lucky, I got a new job. I started studying postgraduate again. I started building some value. I broke up with my girlfriend, and I felt terrible as she did help me a lot, but her willingness to sit still and not push for a great life was holding me back (eg. spending a whole morning in bed on the phone or going to a cafe with friends rather than exercising or studying etc - no balance).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- I drank a little bit occasionally, but nothing crazy. I was tempted to smoke so many times, but I remembered that if I do, I'll eat like shit, and I won't feel like working out the next day. I started slowly changing my diet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- I got lucky again, I got an even better job. I'm where I want to be. I'm at the place I envisioned for myself in a few years, and it only took me 6 months. I can do so much in 6 years...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- I want another girlfriend... I get lonely, but I know that as I continue to get into better shape, and my face looks more lively by the week, I'm well on my way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am on my way to a life that I thought was impossible when I was a chronic cannabis user. I gave two years of my life to frequent use, trying to fill a hole in my life, without even knowing what caused it or how to think about it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It is so hard to do the strong thing sometimes. I found a pathway. I found something I cared about, and while it was challenging, it led to job opportunities. I found a sense of community. I found something outside of myself to focus on.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today, I am not perfect. Sometimes I still make unwise food choices. I still often feel lonely, and even empty. But I'm trying to do the strong thing every day, and know that when I lift weights, walk/jog, or spend time studying or being creative, at least I'm walking down a pathway that can actually provide tangible value in carving out my future. I trust myself more than ever, and this war with myself has made me so resilient.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some people can use cannabis and function. They can do their job, even if its sub-optimal, and find a sense of balance. I can't do that. It consumes me. It owns me. To be dramatic, it smokes me and leaves me in an ashtray of my own sadness.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It only took 6 months and some luck to find the pathway out. I'm so excited to see what 2 years looks like, and what 5 years looks like. I'm not perfect, and I may never be, but that doesn't mean I can't aim for that and accept myself when I fall short, get back up, and go again. I fondly remember that feeling of relaxation and numbness after 5 draws into a joint, but here I am feeling content and proud, and it is so much better. I don't feel guilt. I don't go to the grocery store thinking about how big of a piece of shit I am and how everybody must see how big of a failure I am.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**If you're struggling to make that break, or see that pathway out, my advice to you is:**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remind yourself to do the strong thing. Do the thing that builds resilience. Lift weights. Go for a walk. Go for a run. Create something. Build something. See value in what you do, whether it be your improving physique or a meal you cooked. Be proud of yourself. You're going to die one day, so live now and stop destroying yourself.",11,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4428795}"

I’ve taken breaks many times, when sick or traveling or trying to detox. I always felt like weed wasn’t a problem, and I could manage with the tiniest possible dose as long as I got it every day or every couple of days. 

After increasing anxiety and depression over the last few weeks, I agreed with my bf that it might be time for a change. I decided to only smoke on the weekends, and not during the work week. 

So the last week was… rough! I was convinced that my anxiety and agitation and insomnia were a result of a bad mattress, astrology, anything BUT weed withdrawal. Weirdly, I didn’t have any conscious cravings for THC. I knew the weekend was coming. 

So Friday night I somewhat reluctantly smoked a bowl and had a glass of wine with dinner. I didn’t feel relief or much of anything. I thought “no big deal”. So I smoked a whole joint while on the phone with friends. Again: I’m a long-term heavy smoker and one joint plus one bowl is nothing for me. 

But… wow. I totally puked. Hugely embarrassing. I couldn’t even sleep afterward. I thought “well it must be food poisoning or the wine or the lack of sleep”. I had another toke this morning and while it didn’t make me puke, it also …. didn’t feel good. 

I am ready to really quit weed for real. I fear This will cause a big rift in my family since my folks are all stoners and we do it together. 

I’m scared to quit again this week, worried the anxiety will become unmanageable and impossible. I’ve packed up or tossed my stash and accessories. And I went to my first (online) MA meeting tonight. 

I am terrified and excited for what’s next. I’m glad I found this sub.

I’m 21 from California and I’ve been lurking here for while, but today I’ve decided to write about my experience.  I’m a little curious if anyone has gone through something similar.  I managed to get through all of my teenage years without smoking pot and only occasionally drinking.  I credit it to the fact that my father’s pot habit is what broke my home.  

   I finally decided to try it on my 20th birthday, but I combined it with lots of alcohol so I couldn’t really distinguish that I was high.  I tried it again a couple months later and fell in love with the snowball that pot kicked off the cliff in my mind.  Shortly after, I entered into my first serious long-term relationship with a stoner.  Consequently I very quickly became a daily smoker.  I feel like I was more prone to addiction not only because of genetics but because my first real high was with dabs and it’s easy to get addicted to that massive euphoria-inducing shot of THC.  

   My addiction got to the point where I would take a gram dab every morning before going to my construction job.  I smoked a shit ton of flower too, but dabs always had my heart.  My tolerance was such that I was able to function nearly perfect at work, arguably better.  When I would try to come into work sober, I’d be slow and make all sorts of fumbles and mistakes.  My relationship became strained, (my fault) and we both were pretty much using our highs to coast through and forget about our problems all evening.  Hard to look at your relationship under a microscope when you’re couch-locked!  I know most of you have been addicted much longer than me, but I smoked so much in a 10 month period that I got a pretty solid grasp of what severe addiction was like.  

   I ended up taking a stone sober 10 day cross-country trip with my mother (anti-pot) to bring my aging grandfather back home.  For the first five or six days, I couldn’t sleep or even keep food down.  I had massive mood swings and became ashamed of how much my body depended on weed to perform basic functions like eating and sleeping.  I would just space out for hours because my head didn’t know what to do sober anymore.  Long story short, when I came back I went straight back to my old tricks, but something was different.  My highs were making my anxiety skyrocket.  I would become super paranoid and negative, overthink everything, and my bpm would shoot crazy high to the 170-185 range.  Has anyone else experienced this sudden 180 switch where weed starts having the exact opposite of all the effects it used to?  After about a week I said “fuck this, it’s not worth it” and let my girlfriend smoke the rest of my stash.  

   It’s been two months and I tried hitting my bong on my 21st birthday.  Same exact thing happened.  My brain chemistry all of a sudden just reacts really bad to being high and I get overwhelmed with guilt, paranoia, and anxiety.  It was sadly too late to save my relationship, which promptly failed when I got sober, but I’ve experienced so many positives after quitting!  Mental clarity, better memory, and I can actually enjoy things sober again which to me is a blessing.  I’m going to re-evaluate once I’m 25 and finished with college, but I get the feeling that my conscious and unconscious opinion won’t change that I’m better without it.  

   Thank you to everyone in this community for helping me get through my first two months!  Your posts have been inspirational!  Sorry about my long post, but I am really curious to know if anyone has gone through anything similar with a complete switch in how pot affects them.  Maybe it’s natures way of saying enough’s enough?  Stay strong my friends, it gets so much better!",15,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43967342}"

I've been having alot of issues with my job to where, I knew that after almost 6 years that I wouldn't have a job......not because of me. But because the lack of management support. I applied for different positions within my company and also looked for other jobs. Just none within my pay range at this time .......I didn't know what I was gonna do,So I made the decision to go get my cdl and drive 18 wheelers (my ex and most of my fam drive).

I use to smoke cigarettes and I quit,but looking back I was just done so quitting wasn't hard......but weed to just give that up. Whew child.......everyone keeps telling me to get a hobby. Which I do have plenty I could do except when I'm not anxious or depressed. I sit in the house alone.

I’m not even getting in my bed at night until my body is actually about to pass out. What killed me the last few times I’ve tried to quit was the hard core anxiety and depressive thoughts I would have when laying in bed for hours trying to sleep. Now I’m binge watching Netflix and keeping my mind occupied until it’s tired enough to fall asleep. Last night I stayed up til 5am, slept for a few hours and got out of bed again at 10am. Giving myself permission to do that made a massive, massive difference. Usually the first night without weed is soul crushing. Last night it was manageable, because I didn’t try to force it. Also idk why but social media, especially at night, makes me crave weed. Probably because I used to smoke and scroll for hours. Just watching tv, not being on my phone at the same time, was the distraction my mind needed without being triggering.

Watch the show Alone. Its a survival show, the latest season is on Netflix. Idk what it was about that show but I started it last night and it was so comforting. I think watching other people overcome major struggle all by themselves while I’m in the midst of withdrawal made me feel a lot less lonely and also made me feel like I could do it. I plan on watching every season now!! Hopefully it will get me through the next few weeks. 

Today I closed my eyes, put my hands on my chest, and promised myself and my lungs that I would take care of them. I would give them what they needed to heal and I would love them through the struggle. I know it sounds cheesy but I immediately burst into tears. It was like this huge wave of relief. I’ve been abusing my body for years with marijuana. It needed to hear that I was going to take care of it now.

Been smoking weed for a little over 2 years and here is where I am. 

Backstory:
My life isn't all that bad, I live in Canada, I'm close to my parents, I am organized and have a good job. I am ambitious and motivated to become a big real estate investor. Ive planned the next 5 years of my life and how I'm going to live them to be able to get where I want to. So really, no reason for me to have to smoke pot. It just doesnt have a place in my life honestly. 

Recently more than ever, I have been hating the way I become when I'm high after a toke. As a result, many times I'm high, I get a realization that weed is 100% of the reason I am not where I want to be. Unfortunately though, I wouldn't give much attention or effort to that thought an would just fall back into the same destructive patterns. 

Today is my most recent realization that I REALLY need to stop smoking weed. One of the only things that keeps me from gettimg rid of my weed stuff is that it costs a lot of money. I have 1.5oz of weed right now and $2000 worth of stuff. I want to stop but dont know what to do. As for selling them, No one really buys these for what they are worth so I'd rather give it away or break it. But I really need help :(",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.79657716}"

Im pretty burnt out from how weed makes me feel.,"I’ve been a smoker for about 7 years. I started smoking regularly after I got my first high paying job after uni. I started with it on weekends or going to the movies, but it eventually turned into a daily habit. I’m an artist and have made my living through that for nearly a decade. I can’t imagine things like a used to nor do I have much of an interest coming up with new ideas. Everything is just..foggy and uninteresting. Concepting an idea is something that takes ALOT of willpower and the end result isn’t near where I should be.

I can chart my mental decline almost 1-to-1 with when I started smoking more often. My career is more difficult because I can’t think or remember things like I use to. I really don’t have an interest in improving myself after I smoke. My routine was wait for the spouse to go to bed, smoke a bowl, and play overwatch/watch YouTube videos until 4-5am. Rinse. Repeat. My responsibilities usually require me getting up around 10am, so I’ve been perpetually sleep deprived for years and have just been drifting. 

The past few months have been particularly difficult. My dad died from brain cancer, my finances are strained, and I’ve come to the realization that I’m not where I want to be in life. My dreams aren’t compatible with smoking. I can’t control myself when I’m high and I’m sick of feeling like I’m exhausted and failing every day. Thanks for reading my rant, you really didn’t have to. 

TL;DR 
So here’s to Day 1. It’s time to move on to a new phase in my life. I’m super happy this community exists and is active. I love reading about the support and progress people have made.

Recognise the good, while obviously not forgetting about the bad, and trying to search for a healthier habit. A lot of people in this sub focus more on the negative, which makes sense because the negative is what keeps you away, but to truly let go you have to understand why you like the substance, and ways you can get that same level of enjoyment out of something healthier. For me, finding the strain that lifted the pain from anxiety was what made me enjoy the substance the most. Even if it was a sativa, which usually gives me more anxiety, the pain associated with such anxiety was no longer present. When I'm sober, I let the anxiety ruin my enjoyment of life. It can spiral out of control, and at least with weed I have control. Trying other substances to try to solve this issue did not help, I always ended up going back to weed. Weed just really fixes that one thing I need to fix, even when I try other things to combat it. I am currently starting another sober run, on day 3, however I am not forgetting about the things that I need to stay happy. I am exercising more, sticking to a schedule, meditating (this really does help me deal with anxiety) and talking to a therapist about my process. And if I give in again, I will not be beating myself up about it. It is all a process, but ultimately the end goal is to be happy without weed, as I know the cons outweigh the pros (decreased memory, absence of emotions that makes life feel numb, laziness, impulsivity, mind trickery that convinces me that life is only good with weed).

To everyone, especially young people or people with mental health issues:

It takes time to heal. If your situation is similar in the journey of sobriety, remember that u are not alone. It's worse, but with weed the withdrawals are heavier if you continue to trying to dissolve the pain or the youth in smoke. It seemed impossible for me, but now I am at my longest streak and even friends can smoke without me getting nervous. Also, thanks to leaves for the daily motivation

On Christmas Eve I decided I could take a hit. Mid January I thought “hey look at me go, I can moderate.” I think you know where this is headed. It’s June, moderation has been a sick joke for a couple of months. Sure, I managed it for awhile but it wasn’t long before I started keeping it in the house, made a waterfall, and started skipping certain parts of life to smoke instead. This last month I’ve smoked everyday, all day. I take a hit and I want to be done but I get anxiety about how long my high will last outside the house, better hit it again. Downstairs in the car, wait, better go back up and do one more waterfall for safety. I reached that point where you smoke, wish you were sober but you already ruined sobriety for the day so you smoke alll day instead. All the while telling yourself tomorrow, I’ll quit tomorrow. 

Tomorrow is today my friends. Day 1. In the back of my mind I knew I was headed here. I knew I couldn’t actually moderate, that’s why I never bought another piece. That’s why I made it a point to eat before I smoke, not after, lest I have to endure appetite related withdrawals symptoms again. I’m not as scared this time I know I can do it. 

Some things I’m looking forward to without weed.

Half Marathon (started training today)

Festival Season (I’ll actually be able to stay up and dance all night) 

Game Night (I love board games. I can play all night and not interrupt games with relentless smoke breaks. Not to mention I’m harder to beat sober lol)

Breathing (Smoking makes my lungs feel fragile. It’s hard to take full deep breaths without discomfort especially right after inhaling which is basically all day)

Social Settings (I have a lot of friends that aren’t chronic smokers. I tend to be more outgoing and fun when I’m not high) 

I could go on but what I’m most excited for is not constantly wondering, “when will I get high again, when will I score, do the ppl I’m going to hang with smoke, how will I score out of town, is this event out of town worth it if I’m going through withdrawals the whole time?”

My blood pressure was ass. My emotional health was ass. I was not holding it together at all.

This was right around the time Chadwick Boseman had died and as someone who suffered bowel issues most of my adult life this broke me. This was a man who clearly was making better life choices than I and he just up and dies. Blood tests all come back ""perfect"" as both my PCP and Gastro exclaimed. Why do I feel so terrible, then? It wasn't just the anxiety. All I've ever known was anxiety so I'm pretty familiar with how it affects me physically. These were all new symptoms.

Fast forward to November and my pressure started to level out and I gradually started feeling better. It had been a good 4 months without. So what do I do? Like the idiot sandwich I am, I start smoking again. The symptoms came back, of course, even worse with some wicked left side rib pain. It always starts with abdominal issues that get chalked up to other catalysts and then progresses from there. It takes about 2 months of daily usage for the symptoms to come back I've found.

Deciding to be uncharacteristically social, I had a serendipitous meeting last Sunday with someone who pretty much just gave me a run down of my life story explaining why she didn't want to smoke with us and a light went off. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. She, too, thought she just had IBS or something similar (gastro noted possible IBD but wasn't concerned enough for further testing, let alone mentioning to me 🙄I had to hunt it down in visit notes) until she winded up in the ER multiple times. Wasn't quite that far for me but I quit that night. Desire to bother with it is completely gone. Tossed my half of our smoking apparatuses (wife still smokes and gets immediately defensive if I even suggest quitting to her) and edibles. 

I'm not getting cravings for it. The chest pain went away fairly quickly and I'm not mucusy. Brain fog is clearing. But that damn rib pain keeps coming and going. I thought it had gone yesterday but it came back full force after a filling bowl of  phô. The dreams while vivid haven't been bad and my emotional state didn't make me feel like a psycho this time around. I'm hoping to avoid PAWS but not counting on it.

That being said, I’m currently 9 days into my fifth time quitting! It honestly feels like a sick twisted mind game at this point but it’s nearly second nature.

The first time I quit was in early 2019 for a boyfriend. It put so many things into perspective about my mind and body, issues I never thought could be perpetuated by my dependence to weed. On top of it, flu symptoms, cold sweats, the whole nine yards. The breakup brought about a relapse that lasted through the summer, but I was clean-ish throughout 2019. The pandemic squashed my fear of being tested at school so it brought about another stoner phase. This time and the two times following it proved to be the hardest quitting experiences ever. My relationships with food, water, money, and other human beings were totally warped. I’ve had to take off work because I haven’t been eating enough, but I’m happy to say this is the quickest I’ve been able to get myself back to normal.

I quit the same weekend that my partner of five years and I broke up. So I'm dealing with that, moving out of our shared apartment, and I was already wanting to find a new job because my current one is completely burying me with work for too little pay.

But while I quit in pursuit of clear-headedness—I realized that the relationship should have ended a long time ago, but weed had made me content and complacent—stopping has just made me remember why I started smoking in the first place. My thoughts are constantly racing all over the place. I can't focus on anything. My chest is always tight. I'm in a state of near-panic at all times.

The worst part is that *this isn't new*.

This is how I felt before I started smoking. I've been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety and ADHD with medication for both. I stopped taking my anxiety medication (which had been prescribed in an excessive amount to take three times each day) shortly after becoming a near-daily smoker. I take prescribed ADHD medication and it makes a minimal difference normally, but now it doesn't feel like it's doing anything at all.

Not to mention, I'm afraid I might get fired because I work from home and I've completely abandoned all of my responsibilities.

A few people have told me that I chose the worst time to quit. I need to catch up on an insurmountable mountain of work. I need to figure out moving. Everything seems impossible. I can't do anything or grab onto a thought for longer than half a second. I have sought out therapy but it's almost impossible to find anyone with availability where I live.

After it became legalized in Canada, and covid hit, I started smoking more heavily with my roommates. Which then turned into smoking with old boyfriends, and eventually after wrapping up my first year of uni, turned into a daily habit. And it’s just been heavier and heavier since then.

Here is the whole story, I’ll try to keep it as short and to the point as possible.

I never really smoked weed in highschool and that was totally fine, didn’t really have any problems mentally either. I started college at 19 and started smoking religiously because I hung around people who did. I smoked bongs every day and would be off for short times at Christmas break and spring break and everything was fine. Got sent home because of covid and started by quitting because summer was approaching and I didn’t want to Rely on it because I would work every day. Summer was fine got through it no problem and before I knew it it was September and I was starting school again, except online at home. I never smoked at home because my parents disposed weed so I decided to do dab carts I’d buy from the local reserve. I started to love dab pens and hit them every night before bed. Didn’t really take breaks cus they were so easy and convenient. I eventually limited myself to only doing it before bed because I thought that was being responsible. Started to notice some side effects with my mental health so I started trouble shooting. Figured it was because the pens were not the dispensery grade and had fillers and other bad stuff in them. I started getting the government legal pens about 3 months ago and found them even more potent and I was enjoying them again. This last week I started to notice I was getting anxious and nervous in social situations and I’ve came to the conclusion it’s cus I’ve been abusing weed. I can barley talk to the ones I love most because of my anxiety now. It’s been 4 days clean and I have thrown all my carts away trying to get better. I still havnt had my dreams back but I feel physically fine. Emotionally I’m not the same anymore and I didn’t notice till recently, I can barley laugh without getting nervous.

I know nothing about this community but just feel so lost right now hoping someone can help.  I am someone who wants to be something really great in life, it's been that way since I was little. Particularly I have always had a talent and passion for business. When I first started smoking it was very taboo and dangerous in my mind, it was something I never would have thought I would do and was a real positive in my life at first. I was introduced to a new lifestyle, people, relationships. I even had an in-home fitness brand in high school that I sold to another company and I did it high as a kite. Basically, around the time I started smoking, I coincidentally had a huge financial come up as a kid and felt like I ruled the world. 

However, very quickly into my journey with cannabis did I acknowledge the negative effects it was having. At this point, I had been smoking daily for over a year and it was part of my lifestyle. I have really been trying to quit since then. For two f\*\*king years like a moron. It didn't necessarily use to be this way but I only smoke alone now for the most part. I've built such anxiety when I'm around people after smoking that I have no motivation or desire to interact with any form of sentient life besides my cat, which doesn't make my girlfriend very happy. I've relentlessly beat myself up about this, I just feel so embarrassed. How can I not quit this non-addictive drug when so many people can with ease? How do you expect to be great when you can't even beat this simple obstacle? I've spoken to very few people about this, it's a big insecurity of mine. 

I haven't even willfully been able to last a few days without smoking. If I was sober for a period of time it was never by choice and was typically due to vacation around family. Please, what can I do. How can I start this quitting process? I just need a huge slap in the face.

I know this was kind of a pointless rant. If you have any advice at all, anecdotes or experiences from your quitting process, anything at all, it would be so helpful to me. Thank you.

He mentions that he is gonna smoke a bowl and that I am of course welcome to his weed because I was his “original bad influence” haha. I said fuck it, might as well. I took a tiny snapper rip and thought I would barely feel it.

It got me absolutely fried. It also took about 2 minutes to start clenching my jaw hard as fuck and for me to release every molecule of adrenaline in my body into my blood. I was sitting on the couch having major intrusive thoughts and actually started shaking. I excused myself to the guest room and laid down in the bed actually shaking and shivering like I never have before.

Basically I had a panic attack. Strangely enough it was less mental than previous ones, it was more bodily. The intrusive thoughts still sucked tho.

The fucking crazy thing is that the next day I went out to a shop and tried to buy a delta 8 cart, only to be saved by not being 21. That was a few days ago.

This is what weed does to me. It makes me panic, but the general stoned euphoria is always there in the background which causes me to forget all the awful shit about it and makes me want to smoke more. 

All this being said, I don’t really regret losing my streak. I have been sufficiently reminded that I can no longer handle weed and quitting was 100000% the correct decision.

My boyfriend is a heavy smoker, but he has ADHD, and it seems to affect him in an entirely different way. It's harder to abstain around him, but at least we are meeting on the same level now - I am not a blob incapable of playing chess with him. We can be in love without being smoking buddies.

I do wanna say I don't believe we should ban Marijuana, I still encourage the legalization of it and it has some great benefits for people, but for me I've come to realize I have what some would call an ""Addictive Personality"" which means I easily fall into daily heavy usage of weed. Something that's kinda in my family, my parents smoked weed growing up, acting like it was no big deal, my biological mother and a lot of her side of the family are also sever alcoholics or deal with some other drug addiction, thankfully I cut ties with that side years ago.

I've ""Quit"" multiple times this year actually and previously quit for about 6 months back in 2019, I've got a fun story about my experiences with withdrawals and running around doctors offices trying to find out what's wrong with me that I'll list down the line w/ what I've experienced with quitting and withdrawals.

The problem with my previous attempts was I kept telling myself it's ""Just a break"" ""I can come back to this once I've got things sorted out and I'm back on track"" etc any excuse or I could give and with the pandemic this year especially it's been an experience and has made my cravings and want to escape so very very strong to the point my willpower dropped.

Back in 2017 or so I quit weed for the first time after 6-7yrs of daily usage at this point, I'd had a panic attack that just went on and on, I was hyperventilating and thinking I couldn't breath properly so I decided I couldn't deal with that while high as I can get paranoid and just quit cold turkey. This was a problem, I went into such an insane level of anxiety for days, I was constantly feeling like my heart was going to explode, sweating, shakes, nausea you name it, this last for a month almost, I went to the doctor thinking I was sick and was told I was experiencing a ""Major Depressive Episode"", they did ask if I'd been using any drugs and I told them exactly how often and how long I'd been using as well as the fact I'd quit probably 4-5 days prior to this doctors visit. I just dealt with having constant anxiety and feeling sick for a couple more weeks, eventually I balanced out and started going to the gym for the first time, I got into great shape over six months of this and healthy eating, I was going out and enjoying spending time with friends more, I didn't wanna just sit inside, smoke, and play video games anymore.

I should have registered that this likely had to do with quitting weed but again, I never thought about it, I still thought weed was good for my anxiety so after a stressful work week (Not anxiety really, just a lot of stuff happening) I decided to call up a buddy and get an Airo Pro vape as I reasoned that was better than smoking out of a bong and I could control my intake more, which for a time I did, only on weekends a couple tokes in the evening to mellow out and help me sleep, well that last for a couple months before I was going through a gram cartridge of the vape every 3-4 days, this continued for a solid year I'd say until I suddenly had a night where I started shaking uncontrollably, I'd likely just gotten to high but it scared me so bad because I couldn't stand up, and here we go to my new primary care doctor for a visit thinking I'm sick, ran a bunch of tests, I told him I had been smoking and he recommended I quit which I agreed and again quit cold turkey, queue another Withdrawal episode, Doc didn't register it as such but we found nothing wrong with my health through an array of different tests, I was now listed as having ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"", after a couple weeks of withdrawals this time the physical symptoms went away and my anxiety wasn't an issue, I stayed pot free for six months again in this time I got my own apartment, got a raise at work for taking on more tasks and solving problems I'd been too foggy headed to solve previously even though I made a rule that I never smoke if I have to work that day until I'm done with work (This added to my belief that I didn't have an issue, if I did then I wouldn't have the self control for this)

Now cut to end of 2019, I had decided to try occasionally using edibles again, it'd been a while and I figured I was good so down the rabbit hole again then the pandemic hits and stuff goes crazy, March of 2020 I had a day where I realized I'd been smoking a ton, my anxiety and paranoia about everything going on was going crazy and I needed a break, once again cold turkey, within a couple days I was dealing with the same symptoms as before (I should have noticed this time that ""Hey this happens each time I quit weed, hmmm"" but I'm not that smart I guess) My doctor never mentioned that Weed could have withdrawals, that your body becomes dependent on the THC and quits producing the proper levels of it's own Canibinoids(?), I never once thought this was because I quit weed, I just thought I was sick again, this last for a month in which my doctor ran another ton of tests, my anxiety was out of control, not helped by the fact he mentioned it could be COVID and he'd seen a few cases that didn't have the loss of taste/smell or the lung issues, now I was really panicking and watching everything about my health, the physical withdrawal symptoms not helping and I developed some kind of stomach issue (Believed to be IBS, though I've never until this year experienced it) this last for a month and then I was good, I stayed off weed for a couple months before going back in to pick up more edibles, which again led to picking up a new vape pen and then new glass and picking up actual herb again, the pandemic and living alone got to me too much, I wasn't seeing anyone in person and stuck in a studio apartment working from home, my sanity felt like it was slipping and I was doom scrolling the news, I wanted an escape.

Now we hit October, I was having panic attacks leading into the election and figured weed didn't help, quit again and lo and behold that same weird sickness from March again, I was so stressed about being sick and we ran so many more tests trying to find out what was wrong with me to no avail, I was otherwise perfectly healthy, had CT Scans done of my chest and abdomen, everything looked great, physically I was surprisingly very healthy other than a 25 BMI (That gym membership kinda disappeared when I started smoking again) and I got really depressed, they sent me to a GI Specialist to get a camera shoved up my butt (Super don't recommend that unless you really need it) and nothing was found, by this point it was almost December and I'd started to feel better so I just gave up on the doctors and decided it was just a weird thing.

I started smoking again in January, I quit for a couple weeks at one point as I'd started realizing I had a problem but withdrawals didn't hit as hard, stomach was upset, had some weird hot and cold and my mood was weird but I just dealt with it and got something to help with sleep, I think that was the biggest help as sleep was nigh impossible each time I quit but I went back within a week or two to using my vape, then back to the bong, until this last weekend I quit again after having a weird panic attack Sunday brought on by feeling like I was all alone in the world probably because I'd smoked an eighth+ in two days and I wasn't able to sleep till 2am, stomach started acting up I think because of the panic so I quit weed as of Monday thinking its easier to deal with being sick when sober, but by Wednesday I felt crazy, the first day I was dealing with some IBS like symptoms, I think the panic attack had messed up my stomach as by the end of the day it was a little better, but I was nauseous, having a hard time keeping down food, I was sweating like mad constantly but feeling like I was alternating burning up and freezing, no real temp outside of something like a 99.4 Tuesday, but I've had real difficulty getting to sleep, partially because of the hot and cold flashes and sweating making it incredibly uncomfortable. It was Wednesday when I saw my Therapist, I broke down bawling telling her about the anxiety and depression I felt, how I was sick and just couldn't take it, I told her about how heavily I'd been smoking the past year and how I did start worrying I had a problem, that's when she told me about Marijuana Withdrawals and I started doing research, after years of dealing with different surges of feeling sick, and these ""random"" (every month I quit) having these just crazy anxiety and depression bouts that I'd never before in my life had, freaking out I'd had some mysterious illness unknown to science for a year, it was almost a relief honestly.

Today is Day 4 of sobriety for me, it's been rough but I'm actually hopeful, I know it's gonna be up and down and I definitely have moments where I feel more anxious, or the depression is getting to me (Especially late at night) I also have woken up multiple times throughout the night again just sweating and not comfortable, honestly the sweating and hot/cold flashes are the worst thing I think, the anxiety and depression is a thing but I've dealt with it so many times and thankfully have been seeing a therapist for years to learn helpful ways to manage the anxiety, I've started walking again and enjoying how nice it's been and the greenery, I restocked my fridge and cabinets with healthy food and have been cooking again, I ordered an E-Reader for myself so I could start reading again as I'd been a voracious reader my entire life until I discovered weed and then I kinda just stopped. I'm looking into things to do with my life and trying to plan for the future, looking at trying to save up and get myself a more permanent and nicer housing be it an actual house (Hahahhahahaha I can dream) or at least a Condo with a nice patio so I can make a little garden. The long and short I guess of what I'm trying to get to is I feel hopeful for a future without weed for the first time in my life, and while the withdrawals suck and the cravings are a bitch I know they will pass eventually, I know that if I do give into those cravings its going to be just as hard to quit again and I'm going to go through this again which I am not willing to do.

Honestly, I didn't really expect to drop my life story here but when I started typing it kinda just came out, I don't think I've ever told anyone about my ""Relationship"" with Weed prior to Wednesday when I broke down talking to my therapist, I never believed I had a problem and I was good at covering up how heavily I was using and dependent on weed within my group of friends and my family, most people knew I smoked, I was open about it, but outside of my Doctor visits I never told anyone how often I was smoking, I kept all this bottled up and believed that weed will help and instead I hurt myself, I did get through college w/ honors during my years of smoking and landed my dream job as well, but thinking back I wonder how much farther I could've come in these ten years had I stayed the sober ""I refuse to do any drugs because I saw how badly it destroyed my biological mother"" that was driven, had I sought out therapy for the abuse and chaos that I dealt with all growing up instead of trying to escape those painful memories in weed. But for now I just want to stay hopeful, to look at how bright the future is and how nice it will be to be clear headed.

If you actually read through all of this, thank you, I'm sorry for how long I went on but I think I just needed to get this out there somewhere, maybe my story will help someone come to terms with their usage and start seeking help, maybe not, either way, thank you for reading this and I hope wherever you are, whoever you are, that your future is bright and that you will have a wonderful life.",20,"{'pandemic': 3, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44534665}"

At work i'd be sweating and burning up because it would be hot to me, but my coworkers would say it's not hot at all.

I started smoking when I was 14/15. I want to blame it on peer pressure but the real reason for smoking was due to an empty childhood of feeling invisible. Not to mention, so many of my family members smoked and honestly I thought I would be even more of a black sheep if I didn’t grow up to be a stoner as well. 

I was always the good kid but once high school started, that empty void got louder and I just wanted it to be quiet.I was a social smoker in HS and most of college until my senior year when I was in a toxic relationship and that was the way we trauma bonded. It was a ritual in my miserable life at that moment and being addicted to backwoods made it worse. All my friends and fam smoked also, so after that relationship ended, I continued to smoke heavy. 

I’ve only quit one time in grad school because I was trying to get a job. Not because of the problems it caused bc I was blind to them. However I have now had about enough. The anxiety, dependency, masking of emotions, lashing out at loved ones, stained teeth, racing thoughts, depression, and feeling like a fein when I’m almost low is just not worth it. 

I will just go to say that there is nothing more beautiful than raw emotions. No matter if it’s positive or negative, that is the essence of living. I have things to love in life now and want to be present to take all of that in. I have always labeled myself as depressed or anxious, but perhaps it has been substance induced this whole time and I deserve to know. 

Right now, I am working out, eating as much as possible, drinking hot tea, and taking hot showers and baths. The worst side effect from quitting is the depressive moments since that is what I was masking while I smoked. But honestly I was depressed while smoking so I’ll keep pushing.

I buy cannabis in large quantities and sell it to friends and acquaintances. This is how I finance my weed. Before the pandemic I used to smoke weed with my friends from time to time. Occasionally I smoked alone but mostly with my friends. Then came the pandemic. I couldn't go to school anymore and I saw my friends less and less. I smoked more and more every day. I noticed that I was getting less and less able to live my everyday life. I didn't care about my grades. I didn't care about my parents and my brother. Everything didn't matter. And then I got a psychosis. Fortunately, my parents are quite open to this topic and were very helpful and sweet to me. We went to a doctor and I got a medicine against depression. I stopped smoking pot.  This was very difficult for me because my whole environment consists of people who smoke weed. Also, old customers wanted new weed and old stoner friends wanted to smoke with me again. But I was strong and didn't start smoking again. I didn't want to end up like I did when I was just smoking weed and not doing much else. I half understood that it is bad for me to smoke pot. I was clean for quite a long time, I don't even know how long. I think it was between 3 - 5 months. Then I met a new girl. We liked each other. We got to know each other and I liked her very very much. I fell in love with her a little bit and she liked me too and everything seemed to be going so perfectly. She wrote me that she needed to talk and she would like to talk to me on Discord. Then she told me that it was going too fast for her and she is not ready yet and would rather wait a bit. A few days later she wrote me that she could imagine something with me now and not in the future. That was super hard for me. I started to smoke weed every day again and could see how everything went down the drain. I didn't care about my grades again I didn't meet with friends anymore and if I did then only to smoke weed. So now I'm here with a bunch of weed, psychosis and no motivation to stop. Why should I stop? WHY? The world is so fucked. Capitalism, poverty, rape. The oceans are being fished out, the forests are being cut down, so why stop when everything is fucked anyway? I am so helpless. I have problems with everything and only when I'm stoned I feel good. I don't know how to get out of this hole or why I should.

Yesterday night I had a fight with her before going to bed. I expected her to have more patience with me, and she got pissed off after I said something about how she needs to stop getting bothered when I move around in the bed (she is very sensitive to that, but it never bothered me too much cause I was always stoned at night). I got very anxious and was a bit of an asshole to her as well. 

Today I was also very anxious cause I didn't have time to do certain things.

When I was in early recovery it really helped me to hear from folks who had a bit more time so I'm just trying to pass that along.

My previous posts include my backstory and some life updates, so here are a few things that have happened in the past year.

1. My spouse and I have decided to close our business. This is a time of massive change for us as we transition into new jobs and different routines. As I have many times before, I am definitely calling on the skills I developed when I quit smoking. I know that navigating this would be much more challenging if I didn't already know that I can change everything about my life and come out stronger on the other side!

2. In my last post I mentioned my experience with chronic pain, which is unfortunately an ongoing issue. I am getting closer to finding an effective treatment (I've ruled out a lot that don't work!) but it's an ongoing process. 

3. Like many people, my mental health suffered greatly over this past year. Fortunately I already had a therapist and psychiatrist to help me manage it. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and the treatment for that has been immensely helpful. I learned that there is a strong correlation between ADHD and substance abuse, because it changes the way your brain processes dopamine. Getting this diagnosis has definitely made me see myself, and my past, with a new level of understanding. 

4. Another recent development is that I determined I needed to quit playing video games. I was escaping more and more often into fictional worlds of instant gratification to avoid the challenges of my life, until it became all-consuming. I truly have not felt that disconnected from the world around me, and from my own mind, since the height of my weed use. 

To anyone who is starting their recovery right now - **you are doing a great job & I am proud of you.** To the mods - it is so wonderful to come back to this sub each year and see how the community has grown, y'all are amazing. 

I'm happy to answer questions about my own experience, but please keep in mind that quitting is different for everyone. Just as there were many different negative factors that led to me becoming addicted to weed, so there were many different positive factors that enabled my recovery. I think these factors are different for everyone, though there may be overlap. 

What I hope to do with these posts is show that life after weed is possible. It's a life I never could have lived with weed. There are ups and downs, it's not perfect - but I don't think that's a reasonable goal. I'm not happy, or even comfortable or content, all the time - but I don't think anyone really is. But I know how to navigate the challenges I face, and the happiness I experience is very real, and all that much sweeter for it. I hope each and every one of you is able to find that too.",31,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.63661224}"

I'm at day 6 right now and I don't know how to explain it, but this time just feels different. In the past when I'd try to quit (my longest period was a month), I was jonesing hard all day every day. I couldn't stop thinking about it and that month was a struggle and I relapsed hard because I told myself it was too hard to quit. This time, I signed up for therapy and made sure that any money in the budget that would have originally gone towards pot, was now allocated towards therapy.

It has helped me so much and I've only had two sessions. I specifically went with one that was a licensed drug and alcohol counselor and just in the first session, she asked me a question that really changed my outlook on it: ""What are you trying to avoid?"" and she was right. I was trying to avoid being uncomfortable with parts of my life I didn't want to acknowledge were hurting me. I was trying to avoid trauma I have suppressed for years. I was trying avoid any sort of responsibility for being addicted. She also explained that at one point, after my trauma, pot was a helpful tool and it was okay to have a relationship with it. But just like with people, that relationship changed and now it's no longer uplifting or helping me. And just like with a lazy partner who doesn't contribute around the house, it's okay to want to get out of that relationship!

His youth was spent getting high and attending jam band concerts. Most of his close friends were also users, which naturally meant my childhood friends were also children of users. I have no right to judge him for the decisions he made in his life, but I also have to learn to distance myself from the drug. He used to beat me as a kid, doesn't anymore, but gets real close doing so to my mother whenever he's on extensive periods of sobriety. I started smoking myself when I was 13, mainly to socialize with the ""cool"" kids in school. I've met many great friends through the years of smoking, but that might be about it when it comes to what I've earned from this whole experience. My addiction definitely accelerated after age 18 when my father started asking me to go buy for him because it was too risky for him to go (we reside in an Asian country where it's highly illegal). Not having the financial restriction in accessing pot was certainly the biggest factor for me, apart from my own lack of self-control. To this day I still go pick up for him every three days, but I've figured I don't need to get high just because he says smoking with me is his only time of relief. I haven't been able to confront him about all this.

This is all too common a thing said here, but I'm just done with feeling complacent with myself. I forgot who said this, but weed doesn't make anything better, it just lowers your standards. That's what happened to my father, and that's what I'm not willing to let happen to myself. The last time I managed to quit for three months, I ended up relapsing after thinking one sesh with him would be fine. But that can't happen anymore. My lifes a mess, and quitting pot is not going to magically change anything, but I need to take action if I don't want to give up on my life like he has. Every person I've confided this subject to with has recommended me to move out, and that's where I suppose I'm headed. I wish he could have supported me financially with education instead of buying me drugs, but who am I to complain- there are people who have it much worse. I have to play with the cards I'm dealt with. I'm 6 days into sobriety this time after many years of incessant smoking. Dreams have been extremely vivid. Of course I feel better, but I also figure this is a part of that pink cloud syndrome. Anyway, I just felt like posting this here as a way to push myself.

I thought I would put up a little post to say thank you to everyone in this sub who made me finally realize that it wasn't me that was broken, lots of people have the exact same shameful relationship with Mary Jane that I did, and that quitting weed is something to be proud of. The good people here have been key in helping me quit, and if I could break the habit (smoking an ounce every ten days ish for the last 17 years) then anyone can, and I would like to give back by sharing some things that really helped me get over the first couple of weeks (in no particular order) :

* Find new things to do with your time.  Doing the same stuff you always did while high without weed is a recipe for cravings.  I switched endlessly scrolling through social media and watching absolute shit on YouTube and Netflix with playing video games and reading books.  
* Clean / organize / rearrange your home. Subtle changes in environment help with the mental mind games.  You may be sitting on the same couch you always smoked in, but if the couch is facing a different direction the space feels different.  
* Set goals / rewards that don't include weed. Mine has been to save up all the money I would have spent on weed for a motorcycle.  Added up my habit was costing me over £8000 a year.  The app grounded keeps a total of what you would have spent, if I have a shitty day and I'm thinking about buying some weed, I look at it and remind myself that I have better uses for that money than setting it on fire.
* Exercise!  It doesn't matter what condition your body is in, post exercise endorphins feel good and really helped me to overcome cravings.  
* Take pride in your appearance. I ditched the ratty old hoodie and shitty old jeans combo I've always worn, started shaving every day rather than waiting till I looked like a deranged Viking. It might be a cliché but looking good really does make you feel good. 

Much love to the group, to those who are further in their journey, thank you for the inspiration, I really cant put into words how much relating your experiences have helped me.  To those just starting out, you can do it.  The idea of never smoking again is scary to think about, but that's the addiction talking.

Much love to everyone in this community for sharing your experience -- it helped me so much knowing I wasn't alone. I hope my little story helps someone who is struggling. Five lessons from six week sober:

1/ **Commitment is key**. Before I got sober I tried and failed so many times to get sober. I lost count but I didn't quit. I kept reading, listening to podcasts, exploring online (where I found this community), walking, journalling, and trying. Eventually something clicked and my body-mind knew it was time to stop poisoning myself, time to commit After so much trial and error I'm 100% committed. its not optional, I don't smoke, simple as that.

2/ **Weed** ***is*** **addictive.** I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't know weed was addictive until I found this community. Now I realize that for me weed is an addictive obsession with negative consequences and it destroys my human potential. I can't even smoke one toke. Simple as that.

3/ **Weeks 1-4 of are the worst**. I was a raging areshole for weeks 1-4. I was miserable to my wife and kids, as my brain went to business on rewiring itself. Thanks to this community, I could understand the rage, the anger, the sense of mourning and loss, the wild dreams, the messed up appetite and sleep patterns, the lack of motivation, the pink cloud, the crashing off the pink cloud, the complete and utter roller coaster of quitting. At six weeks my sleep is wonderful and restful, I'm more organized in my thoughts and life, I have more energy. I'm glad I powered through those first four weeks and I don't plan on having to do *that* again.

4/ **Recovery is a gift.** I was wasted so much of the last 27 years. I made a lot of mistakes, said a lot of stupid things, did a lot of stupid things. All that is in the past. Now I wake up every day and I give myself permission to accept the gifts of sobriety.

This might be a little long but I'd just like to give some information on my history with weed and my mental health. I started to smoke weed about 10 years ago, at the age of 18. I'm sure you guys all know the feeling of smoking weed for the first time ever, feeling euphoria, and immense amount of pleasure and dopamine just being released like never before. It was amazing and something I looked forward to do. I would wonder, when listening to my favorite songs and eating my favorite food, how much better it would be while high. I always loved to listen to music, just having a lot of hobbies and was always interested in learning new things -- I felt like I lived a real good even if I wasn't smoking weed.

But less than a year later of me starting to smoke weed, I started to notice something. The first thing I've noticed that made me take note of the issue was the sound of music. The music I'd listen to while sober didn't give me as much of a pleasure it used to give. I thought it was just apart of aging, but I was only around 19 and I looked around and saw a lot of people just enjoying the hell out of life. People much much older looking to go concerts and having the time of their life and all that. I listened to different music and even the old music I haven't listened to for a while and it didn't give that same pleasure. Even the music I was listening to at the time a lot didn't give me that pleasure I'd normally get.

And then over time, my depression and anhedonia just got worse and worse (been 9 years now). I cannot think of any other reasons for these issues arising. Perhaps, it was always under the surface and weed was the thing that caused it to surface? But I just don't know. I've been kinda feeling a feeling of emptiness that just gradually went downhill more and more. I want to also note that there were years in between the first time I started smoking and now that I didn't smoke very often at all (around 2014-2016). Then in 2017, that's when I started to smoke more regularly and even more so. Now, weed still didn't hit me like how it used to prior. I know it'll never hit me like that again, especially since it seems to amplify my feeling of anhedonia and emptiness at times. So in the last 4 years, I was smoking a lot more frequently, but as time went on, my breaks became more frequent. I stopped around the start of February last year and broke my streak around July.

This year, I've also stopped around the start of Feb. and I'm still off the weed. I have no plans of smoking again. There's very little reasons for me to do so when I don't feel much of a joy of experience from it.

But I've been feeling the worst I've ever felt. A huge loss of my emotions. Just super flat, anhedonic, apathetic. It's killing me. My personality just feels totally gone, and I noticed when I smoke weed, I feel like more of my personality goes away.

And I'm just here wondering... was it all because I started to smoke weed? Because I cannot think of anything else that made me feel this way. No traumatic events or anything. I just don't know. I've been trying to figure it out. Did I fry my dopamine receptors or something? Because my reward system and ability to feel pleasure just seems to be shot. And even more so in the last 4 years when I started to smoke again.

**TL;DR:** Wondering if marijuana can cause long-term mental health problems that will persist even if you aren't smoking. Been dealing with depression, anhedonia, and apathy for about 9 years now. Started smoking 10 years ago, started to deal with issues about a year in, had some years in between where I didn't smoke, and started to smoke more frequently in the last 4 years which slowly tapered down less and less. Been off of it for about 4 months now but my anhedonia has seems like it's gotten even worse. Wondering if my dopamine/reward system has been fried or messed with in a way. I can barely feel any bit of emotions, and it's just killing me.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3936263}"

Or she thought about changing her plans to check her luggage but was worried it might get taken at a random check. Then what would she do? Maybe, she told us, she should cancel all together. Seeing my own behavior reflected back at me made me sad.  We deserve freedom. We deserve to break from the internal fights we have with ourselves.  We deserve to travel and see people freely, without being weighed down by any addiction.

I have come a long ways in my life. I have quit things completely cold turkey by just waking up and deciding I was done. 

Weed was different than the rest. It took careful planning and has taken a lot of effort not to return to. I believe although it is not ""physically addictive"" it becomes very ingrained into our personalities and almost begins to reflect as part of who we are. I am at the point I am ready to identify myself differently and being a stoner does not have to be me.

When I say stoner I really mean I was a stoner. I took things to far and on an unchecked day it was not uncommon for me to easily blow through an eighth to a quarter daily. I can empathize with the illusion of functionality and that is where I would like to talk about my struggles and to get things off of my chest so I can hopefully move on to new and better life experiences.

I recently returned to school and found myself doing better than I ever had before. I had a safe corner of my living room where off camera I could do whatever I wanted unlike in a real classroom. I found myself smoking at my desk and during lecture time. I ultimately taught myself how to do advanced level algebra and basic chemistry under the influence. I recently went through finals this week, sober and clean but felt like I couldn't remember how to do these things because I was in a different headspace than how I had learned it. This threw me for a loop and created a massive anxiety attack to occur while taking my math final but I stayed strong and got through it with 87% and ultimately maintained my A in the class.

Could it really just all be an obscured illusion that weed makes you better? I honestly feel yes. From my experience as a very high functioning stoner the hard part was teaching myself to function better without it. But after 3 weeks (the longest I have ever not smoked in 16 years) I feel less clouded and ultimately feel like a stronger person now than I did when I was smoking.

Back to the beginning when I was talking about weed almost being a personality trait I feel that just like any other trait inside yourself that you see inside as a problem you can change, and ultimately you don't need to be the person that you might think you are if that is going to stand in the way of personal growth. I believe everyone has the strength inside of them to ultimately be different.

Taking the time to share this with you all has really made me feel like a weight has been lifted off of me and hope that everyone can someday have the same strength and clarity that I have managed to use.

I passed 5 weeks sober yesterday. I honestly find myself in disbelief that I'm sober and choose to be, every minute of every day. Life is better like this.
The things I've noticed:

▪︎I'm better at my job. I throw myself in every single day and I'm reaping the benefits. I'm becoming relied upon and it's wonderful.

▪︎My sleep is 100000 times better. I've dealt with insomnia for the last 10 years and I absolutely love the sleep I'm getting. Feeling refreshed in the morning is so worth it. I'm even dreaming!

▪︎I'm more present day to day. I sit and watch a film and take it all in, instead of just sitting through it.

▪︎Exercise is amazing. I do a weekly walk and again, I just love being present and enjoying nature.

▪︎I'm starting to get drops of dopamine from things I enjoy. I'm way more into my hobbies and get more out of them.

Thats what I can think of off the top of my head. Obviously it's not all sunshine and roses, I still have depression and anxiety but my symptoms are better and I don't get 'the black cloud' nearly as often. It also turns out I can cope with everything life has thrown at me while I'm sober.

I felt really angry today from all the stress, because I don't know how I can handle the workload that's being put on me. I felt like idk if I'm enough, felt like quitting to be at ease, felt disappointed for feeling all these negative feelings that came up. 

These thoughts and feelings are just patterns I've used to cope with. Feel bad? Just quit, so you won't have to worry about failing, takes the pressure off (and subconsciously feeds the idea of being a failure or not enough)

Thing is, the self-hatred or limiting negative beliefs won't go away if I went and bought. I would've been disappointed and probably pissed for doing so, and I realised this before hand. It would've not served me in anyway or helped me to smoke and temporarily try to escape my circumstances.

I've entertained the thought of buying for hours, however, I feel like just about everything in my life and my intuition tell me that I've tried this route and it doesn't make me feel good. Everytime I think of downloading an app and sending a msg, I get hesitant, I stop and start doubting, and this can go on for a long time. It seems that I'm not that fond of the idea of relapsing actually, something in me, some part of me is awake and knows that this is not what I want to do. Not what I REALLY want to do. Have you had that experience? You just KNOW, somewhere deep down, that this isn't the way, this isn't a way to live, this doesn't feed my soul and nurture my wellbeing, or help me get forward in life.

All this time questioning, *""To buy or not to buy?"".* A lot of energy spent doing nothing but pushing and pulling. I'm glad for that wise part exists in me though, the one that tells me I shouldn't buy, even though I may not necessarily understand why, and my ego will start arguing it's not that bad, other people do it lalala. Thing is, we don't always remember how shitty it is to quit and rise from that hellish state of having had enough of suffering. You'll only think of the ""one time"", but not the consequences and possible loop.

&#x200B;

It's been about 2 hours I've considered buying, but it's freaking late and I got work tomorrow. I'm better off not smoking today and getting better sleep, and being sharper tomorrow. Still that devilish voice in my head is saying ""come on, it could be fun"". Maybe, but I already have made it through today (soon 10pm), would I reeally regret being sober for the rest of today and not giving in to an urge to escape in fantasy, only to come back down again? Probably not.

It's joked about in Hollywood used in movies, musicians and entertainers use it and so on but it's still looked down upon.. I never graduated high school and I barely had anyone I could actually call a real friend. I was the fat Mexican kid who sat in the back of the class and stay quiet. Once I started smoking with my cousin and little brother I knew that this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. First it was just on the weekends when we would smoke then eventually it was daily. I make music, so it went hand in hand. It made sense. I didn't start to realize how much tribulation I had ahead if me with the choices I would make because of weed. I would eventually just skip work to smoke and I would spend literally all my money on weed. Once I would cash my check of about $400-$500 I would by a quarter hang out with ""friends"" and just smoke it away within that day or weekend and just constantly buy more and more then on top of that buy hella junk food through the week and be broke by Tuesday or Wednesday. I never saved anything, never had a savings man.. I didn't know how much damage I was doing to myself.. this went on for years. I jumped around from job to job, mainly my addiction would make me feel like just calling in and smoke the day away.. eventually it would get to the point that I called in so much I would overthink that I everyone I worked with knew what I was doing and we're either mad at me or disappointed so I would just quit my job..

I  left 3 months ago to start my own parking lot striping company. The thing is tho the only reason I quit was because I called into my job 3 days in a row... It's sad man I would get high and just play video games and make beats and then when the night came I just didn't want it to stop so I made up excuses so I could continue the next day. On the third day my brother and I was talking about shit we could do so we could just chill and smoke pretty much.. I quit that night and bought a truck and paint machine to start my business.. but tbh I didn't want to do that.. my judgement was clouded because I was high af.. I was just thinking about staying home smoking and doing nothing.. it showed because our business failed and now we're behind rent.. now I'm rushing to find a job and i see what damage I have done to myself..  I regret ever smoking for the first time when I was 17.. I know where I fucked up. Now I'm trying to fix it.. it's hard man.. it really is.. almost every job I apply to I have to do a drug test.. it kills me when I find out I have to submit a drug test because it's one side sword for the work force . I fail a drug test they just see a weed junkie.. they don't see the that I made mistakes and that I'm trying to change my life around.. they don't see that.. they just see a unemployed pot head.. they will never understand that some people are trying to do a 360 and lead a sober life.. i haven't smoked in about 2 weeks now. And it's depressing when I know I can't pass a drug test yet.. and then I have to deal with overthink and doubt and bills stacking up... idk how I'ma get out of this massive hole I dug myself in but I know for a fact once I get myself back on track.. I'm never smoking again.. I know for a fact it will make me throw it all away again just to be able to stay home and get high... If you made it through that long ass read I applaud you.

2021-06-09 12:02:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nvzd14/day_3/,Day 3," Hey guys. Just would like to vent. 

I quit on Sunday night. I was a daily user for 3 years, but only in the last few hours before bed. THC cartridges and a pipe/flower combo were my go to ways to consume. I am feeling the withdrawal symptoms. Night sweats, insomnia, anxiety at work or in uncomfortable situations. I’m having a tough time dealing with them.

And now, I’m beginning to question why I quit. I’m 24 years old and live in Canada. Most of my friends and acquaintances do it, and they seem fine? Why can’t I be like them?

What mainly motivated me to quit were the terrible lows I'd usually feel on a Monday morning. Because I only smoke at night - it feels like I’m always in a down or cloudy mood during the day. I do run every morning, which seems to give me high to get through the day but I still itch for that first bowl in the evening.

A few other reasons I’m trying to quit - are motivation and to build relationships. I’ve become more isolated over the last bit, and feel incredibly lonely. I’m not motivated to go out or meet new people or try new things. 

Thankfully. I have a good support system with my parents. I’m able to talk with them about it, and they understand addiction and what I'm going through. At the end of the day - it always helps to talk.

One thought I keep having - is about caffeine and other addictions. Every morning I drink 2 to 3 cups of coffee. Is that also an addiction? What makes the Cannabis addiction bad, but the caffeine addiction okay? I don’t think I’d be able to function without my morning coffee every day. 

I think I have an addictive personality too... I had OCD at a very young age, and looking back, it’s almost like I was addicted to the habit of washing / cleaning things. Then, I got into video games, and spent way too much time with my eyes glued to the screen. In the late teens I’d masturate all the time - sometimes 2 or 3 times a day just to feel that high. 

If any one has suggestions, exercises or profound thoughts on any of this - I’d love to hear them. Thanks for reading and being able to follow this rambling mess too - I appreciate it.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5628524}"

This helped me be motivated and gave me a little feeling of accomplishment every time I got to fill in a green box. I have now started using it as an overall agenda.

 I started of putting important thing in there like motor cycle drivers lessons ( one reason I wanted to quit)

I stopped cold turkey. I had attempts to stop before but nothing lasted more than a couple of months. This is my longest streak yet. Im not out of the woods yet.

I used the weed to 'treat' my adhd and PTSD. But of course, that's an illusion. So, I tried to quit smoking back in January and February, which also lasted 4 weeks, and when I relapsed I noticed that I could focus again on my daily stuff and my music production when I was high. 

Now my focus is all over the place, meaning, it's nowhere to be found. In the first weeks I had extreme moodswings, which are slowly fading away. 

I do some sports almost everyday, for usually 1 to 2 hours like riding bicycle or take a long walk. 

Also, I do a bit physical work at my workplace. And I do some meditations almost every day too. 
Will start with PTSD therapy very soon as well... 

But this is very frustrating. I don't want to get on adhd medication. But I want to make my music without getting distracted by literally everything, not by my thoughts and not by my surroundings or social media. Really. It drives me crazy. Also because I want to take all these feelings that I suppressed for so long into my music, it was one of the reasons I wanted to quit. So I can have some nice stuff when my gigs are back. 

Surely there are other people in this group who have the same diagnoses as I have, how long does it take? Any advice?

Looking for some... Advice? Reassurance? Not really sure to be honest, I just need to get this down somewhere, hoping that maybe I'm not alone in this experience.

I suffer from c-ptsd. I was using cannabis to cope with my symptoms, but realized I was in a really unhealthy place with it, and have now been off it for coming up 2 weeks.

The issue I'm having is that the further down the road I get, the more horrendous my dreams are getting. I am having negative dreams on a near nightly basis now, leading to me waking throughout the night, and feeling more and more tired each morning. I can wake from one bad dream and go straight into another when I do fall back asleep. 
My husband has always said I'm a light sleeper, I will stir at the slightest of noise or movement from him, which is likely linked to the hypervigilance I suffer with.

I'm wondering if anyone else has experience with this? Did your dreams plateau, and return to a semblance of 'normal' or even 'positive' after a certain amount of time? I really just want to feel rested, and while I would wake every morning before with a 'stone-over' feeling groggy, I at least wouldn't remember dreams a lot of the time. 

For the record these aren't flashbacks, they are seemingly unrelated to my trauma and are very abstract. Last night for example we were on a small fishing boat trying to cross the ocean and the boat kept capsizing, my husband was knocked unconscious and I was clinging to him and the boat with every bit of energy I could muster.

Finding it hard to hold onto the light and just hoping that someone out there can reassure me. I have had a lot of therapy relating to this trauma and I am now at the point where I don't know how revisiting it another time and rehashing the same old stuff can help. I also am not keen on the idea of replacing cannabis with a sleeping aid or some other form of prescription medication, although if this is what others have done I will most certainly take that recommendation on board. 

Even if you don't have advice I'd really appreciate hearing other people's experiences, positive or negative, complex disorders or not. 
Did dreams worsen, and then later improve for any of you? 
Feel like my brain is playing cruel games with me, and I can't win.

Played guitar since I was twelve, but as you've guessed, I can't bring myself to be interested in playing or writing music at all right now.

I have my birthday get together with friends tomorrow and I desperately want to cancel because I feel as if I'm going to have some sort of breakdown.

This is about my 3rd week since quitting. I have quit once before and the withdrawal didn't seem as bad or last as long as this. I didn't smoke for as long this time, however I abused it far more.

I went through extreme agitation and anger the first week into the second, which is gone now. The 2nd week I was basically euphoric though, completely going out of my comfort zone and enjoying it. 

Fast forward to now, I feel like crying over the smallest things. My memory still feels absolutely shot. I go to do something and immediately forget what it was. I've been misplacing things for the entirety of my withdrawal and it hasn't let up. Its driving me crazy. I feel dumb. Sometimes I can't even say/write gather my thoughts properly. I feel like I'm still not dreaming like normal and my sleep feels of poor quality. I however didn't suffer from insomnia this time around, not sure why. I haven't played any games for the entirety of my withdrawal and still don't feel like it which is abnormal for me, gaming is my biggest past time.

I guess I'm posting to feel not alone. For reassurance that this is normal to feel like this, 3 weeks in? I just dont remember feeling this bad last time.

I posted about my reasons [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/nqeg1f/wow_it_really_is_poisoning_us/) if you want to see. I can already see so many changes. I'm so much more articulate/coherent. I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day (still takes me a while to get out of the comfy bed). My constant depersonalization-derealization symptoms are slowly easing. I'm gradually starting to dream again. My depression isn't really too different but my anxiety has gone from constant to very infrequent, maybe once every few days. Today at work there were call outs and I had to bust my ass with physical labor pretty much constantly for 8 hours and I didn't need a sip of coffee to do it, my energy was so consistent. And at the end of the day I felt so great! Not tired or achy or desiring weed at all. In fact, all I wanted to do was work on the new long term goals I've been formulating since I quit! But I did let myself relax instead, because I need to learn how to relax naturally, without weed.

I felt so great after work today that I finally found the confidence to do something I could never do during my previous breaks. It was unthinkable. I always convinced myself that I needed to save the bubbler even when I quit, because SO many great memories are tied to it. Whenever I held it I could remember all of the amazing times I had for the last few years, before the pandemic had me move cross-country (Yes I even hid it in my checked luggage, it was buried in a heap of random stuff thrown in an enourmous bag. Yes it was a stupid move). But those memories will be with me regardless of if I have the bubbler or not. And it's just a temptation at this point. And I just feel SO GOOD. Better than I have in so, so long. So I did it. I smashed it with a big ol' hunk of obsidian. Gave the rest of the weed to my little brother, threw out the rest of the supplies and that was that!

What has been helping me, \*personally\*? Well, I'm not counting the days. I am taking the advice someone once said here and internalizing that I am not a person who smokes. I don't tell myself I'm a former stoner, someone in the process of quitting an addiction, or what have you, though those things are true. I just finally decided, after years of trying, that I not only wanted to be someone who does not use these substances, I *am* that person. The person that does not smoke weed or any of that stuff. I am solely focused on the present and the future, not the past. And presently, yes, I am a person who does not do these things. What's there to count? The days don't matter to me anymore, that's how committed I am to this. Counting, for me, just reminds me of how short of a time span my soberness has actually been in place. It connects me to my past self that I no longer want to be. Instead, I have created a self that just doesn't use. And now I'm exploring what that self is like, day by day. 

That said, I also constantly monitor my thought processes and how I'm feeling. If something is likely caused by withdrawal, I'll do my best to recognize it and keep an eye on it. I know that my brain will be going through changes for an obscene amount of time. I need to pay off the debt I incurred by using all these substances for so long. So I'm being gentle and understanding with myself. Recognizing that my brain will take some time to catch up to my soul. I've poisoned the vessel that is my body for so long. So I know not to expect instant miracles and instantly be back to normal. But I am committed to using the remainder of my life to improve myself and make up for lost time. Of course, to be honest, I still fantasize about reaching retirement sober like this, and then spending my remaining days high as fuck. But maybe by the time I reach that point, I'll just continue feeling happy just being sober and alive!",10,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.85761505}"

I have a story to share which I hope will inpire others to rethink their cannabis use. Everybody must make this choice for themselves, but I thought i'd share this:

About 3 months ago I stopped using weed. I was not a heavy user so I did not have to kick the habit, but I liked a joint from time to time (2 times a week, sometimes more). 3 months ago I just stopped smoking, it was not a big plan or anything, but it did not feel right anymore. 

I felt stuck emotionally, the weed seemed to mask this. Now that I stopped weed, I feel not as good as 3 months ago. There have been a lot of things that happened in my life the past year and I thought I was managing quite well (processing it well). Turned out it was just the weed feeling this way. I think smoking weed made me happy where I was emotionally and mentally, but prevented me from ""moving on"" and becoming stronger. 

In a way weed was a golden cage for me, it was pleasant to be in, but in the end of the day it is still a cage and who wants to be in a cage? Of course this story is really personal and I do not wish to talk bad about people who really enjoy smoking weed or those who depend on it, it is just my personal experience. Yesterday in bed everything ""clicked"" and I realized this was the connection I had with weed.

Day 1 again after a 103 day break. I went camping this weekend with friends and decided to smoke. I was craving it leading up to it and went for it. I had a good time but to be honest I like myself better when sober. I don’t like feeling spacey and having the dry mouth. I also somewhat regret it but also happy I did it so I can fight back the cravings when I romanticize it. It’s not worth losing the streak over. I made a string decision that after the weed i smoked that I wouldn’t purchase any. Thought of hitting up my dealer but then thought you had your fun. Now back to being weed free. Let the count begin and those clean lungs breathe! I do not miss how exhausting the whole process is, I don’t miss the $$$, I don’t miss it and happy to stop again. I look at this weekend where I smoked two blunts and a half as a slight moment of weakness and back on the sober train. I know my wife is also happier with me not smoking and what she thinks of me means a lot. I want to be present for her and be the best husband I can be. I don’t want to be zoned out or forgetful. Also, my anxiety felt a little higher smoking so that’s another reason for me why it’s not good. I have way more cons than pros. I also notice that I more so like the smoking part versus the weed or high. I will drink plenty of water and get back to what I was doing.

I found this community as many others might have - in fear that something might be wrong despite my attempts to treat my body and mind better. Over the course of my journey, I've experienced a **range of symptoms** that seem to be routine after reading many others' stories. Different phases or waves of bodily pain seem to strike in creative ways that make me wonder if I'll live to see another day. Although, I've done well so far managing the physiological changes along with finding myself spiritually.

&#x200B;

I smoked multiple times daily for around half a year while I began smoking Juul during summer 2019. I decided to quit both at the same time after having an episode while I was high:

\- I felt my arm getting tight (a pinch of pain)

\- My jaw felt a little sore

\- Palms sweating (with a sense of chills)

\- Acute vision distortion (my sight began to look like TV static)

\- Ears ringing (followed by a slight loss of hearing)

I've had panic attacks a handful of times before, but this felt a little different (possibly because I was high). I was aware of what was going on and tried to calm down while intentionally avoiding hyperventilation. I called an ambulance (to which they couldn't really help, but at least I was in their hands and felt slightly safer), and afterwards visited my local urgent care facility.

&#x200B;

 I'll do my best to summarize my encounters with medical staff since then:

\- ECG always normal

\- Vitals always normal

\- Chest X-ray normal (per St. Luke's Cardiologist)

\- Chest ultrasound normal (per St. Luke's Cardiologist)

\- Misdiagnosed with acid reflux: prescribed Omeprazole which almost triggered another episode (I could do an entire post on the horrible physicians that I encountered)

\- Bloodwork normal (only a Vitamin D deficiency which I've since corrected)

**I can't seem to escape the brief chest pains** (sometimes sharp, sometimes dull), and the occasional feeling of somewhere in between ""awake"" and ""asleep"" where you zone out really hard in a short amount time (which began recently).

I've done my best to get the right help and **figure out how to just alleviate the sensation that something violent is about to strike in my chest region**. I'm hanging in there but it's the hardest thing I've ever done, and the scariest thing I'll probably ever experience.

I was trapped in an exhaustive cycle of smoking weed and day by day I became more ashamed and insecure with myself. I'd swear off it, or I'd try to moderate, and then that thought would come in my head - there's nothing wrong with one joint. It'll help me relax. It'll help me have fun. It'll help me cope. It'll help me feel normal. Just this one and then I'll get my shit together. I'll be disciplined this time.

I fell of the wagon in May and smoked socially a few times. I hung on to a cart on its last legs and just completely fucked my sleep schedule *again*. I'm ready to re-commit to kicking this godawful habit and coping mechanism.

&#x200B;

In the past month and a half, I quit one job for another–I went from a volunteer term working in-person to my first WFH office job at a non-profit–and I just moved into my first apartment this weekend. They weren't huuuuge transitions but transitions and milestones nonetheless and I am exhausted and worn down and stressed, to say the least. I ended up hitting the cart almost each night for the past week and I honestly feel ashamed; this habit is so incredibly hard for me to kick and I'm ashamed that I'm at the starting line again. 

&#x200B;

I'm very hard on myself and I tend to not notice when I'm neglecting myself, my work-life boundaries, and my physical well being. I'm disappointed that I'm not miraculously immune to stress and bad habits. I'm disappointed that I am so deeply human and not indestructible. I'm 23 and know better but I haven't aged out of the whole ""I'll be this young and invincible forever!"" thing yet.

I recently gave up weed after around 10 years of use. I started around 18 and smoke fairly moderately then Quit for about 4 months at 23 for a job. Now I’m 29 and decided to give it up for good. I felt like it wasn’t as enjoyable as it used to be and I found it to be affecting my life. Wake up on a non work day smoke. Get home from work smoke. Leave family events with the only intention of getting home to smoke. I have addiction in my family. My mom is an alcoholic and many of her siblings have battled with drugs and alcohol. I never felt I was an addict. But with weed my body is having a hard time. Here’s my symptoms.

Week 1 —- I had the classic mood swings, headaches,night sweats. Which I’ve had before when stopping so wasn’t to concerned.

Week 2-4— felt almost like normal it was great. Thought quitting would be easy.

Week 5 -11 (current week) —- I have had a bunch of physical mild pains. Some shooting pains some pins and needles type pains. Also my skin has been itching a lot more than usual. I had a couple week bought of bad left stomach pains which I went to the ER for. Everything looks fine bloodwork looks normal. My ribs for a couple weeks felt like somebody hit me with a baseball bat. My stomach issues have lingered but seem to have slightly improved. Now this week I’m getting some mouth/teeth type pains that comes and goes for no reason. 

All of this crap added to the anxiety and stress of this all happening hasn’t been fun. I’m determined to stay off the weed seeing what it has done to me. Never thought it was this addictive.

I've been reading through some of your posts on here for quite a while now (mostly on an my main account) and hearing your guys stories and your experiences has been really helpful. 

The first time I smoked was at 14 and from there on the extent of my habit has been getting worse and worse. It used to be every couple of months, then weeks and eventually I found myself smoking daily. 

The longest I ever managed to quit was 6 months. This run failed when Covid hit my country and I spent the majority of time alone at home during lockdown. At first I was quickly back to multiple joints a day for more than a year but after my mental health got significantly worse and being high just wasn't enjoyable anymore, I somehow managed to cut down my usage to one joint in the evening (except on the days where I had to get new weed, I smoked a lot with my dealer ""friends""). 

Everytime I was high I would only think about quitting but as soon as I came down, this feeling would always fade. 

I've been contemplating about finally quitting for good since december last year. I have countless failed attempts under my belt since then, the longest lasting only a couple of days. I know, pathetic. 

I want this substance out of my life soo badly, but somehow I just can't let go. I keep telling myself: ""After you run out, you will quit and not buy any more"" but as soon as I actually run out, I just keep buying more, convincing myself that this will be the last time.

Anyways, I am trying again today and I'm scared. I know the first couple of days are the hardest and usually I get really bad withdrawal symptoms. I really hope I will get through the withdrawal and that this time will be the last. I have even made a list of benefits to quitting and a list of things to distract myself. Thats a first for me.

I just want to say thanks to all of you amazing people out there, I really appreciate this community and how understanding you all are. Wish me luck on my journey back to a normal life...",14,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43115428}"

I've been sober for a bit more than three months now. Stopped smoking cigarettes and using facebook/instagram a year ago, and then weed three months ago (and I rarely drink alcohol and when I do it's to taste some awesome microbrewery beers from my town, not to get drunk. And unlike weed, I can stop after only one).  In the past, cannabis helped me a lot with PTSD symptoms like hypervigilance, it helped me go around without feeling everyone's feelings too intensly, helped me live the childhood I missed out on and overall I enjoyed the buzz. But it had become a compulsive coping mechanism and it made me numb. I was a daily smoker. I was highly functional. It didn't impact my job or my relationships. It's hard to see why it's bad at first, because everything seems to go so well. I had a special strain for every activities (weed is legal where I'm from so it's easy to have lots of variety). One for work, one for going out with friends, one for listening to music, one for hiking, one for arts, one to sleep, one for gaming and so on. I'm grateful for what weed has done for some time in my life, because at one point it really did help me get through some super hard stuff and anti-depressant made me feel a lot worst so that wasn't an option for me. Note that I've been seeing a psychologist weekly for three years now, and that helped a lot.

*Here are the reasons why I stopped, and what I found helpful when the cravings were the worst.*

**Why I stopped even if it didn't impact my life that negatively  :**

1- Whatever I do in my life, I want to be free. It might sound cliché, but to me freedom is non-negociable. When you are addicted to something, you're not independent anymore : you NEED that fix to function properly. It becomes the new sober. And if you're always thinking about your next buzz, are you really free to choose what you're thinking about ?

2- The serenity of a life where you're not always chasing the next high. The higher you go, the lower you find yourself after. Reducing the height of highs might seem boring at first, but you'll quickly notice how your emotions stabilize and everything feels calmer. Also, the lows don't make you that miserable. I want a peaceful life, not a marathon to the next party. I surprised myself actually wanting to go for a run.

3- It makes the bare minimum satisfying. When you're always high, you don't notice how effortless and unfulfilling your life is.

4- You are your own garden you have to cultivate. When I started therapy three years ago I thought my garden was dashing ! But the more I dug, the more I realised all my plants were fake ones. Everything was artificial. Growing a garden from that place takes a lot of dedication and patience. There are no shortcuts. *BABY STEPS!* If you start getting the tractor and the big agriculture stuff on simple sprouts, you'll kill them. You need to be gentle and compassionnate with your garden. After all, it's you. And does your garden really need roaches and smoke? Some people can do it reasonnably while keeping their plants healthy, but hey, if you're reading this, let me break the news for you : you're not one of these people. Stop being in denial, you're only making it harder on yourself. The way you treat yourself is in direct link with your self-esteem. Self esteem is the fuel for everything you do in your life. Would you treat your friends or your family the way you're currently treating yourself ?

5- In therapy, I was identified as a ""gifted"" person, meaning my brain is hyperactive. I have a hard time truly connecting with most people without pretending to be someone else, and I was using weed as a way to dumb myself down. And you know what ? It worked. I did dumb myself down. I had exactly what I wanted. Was I happy about it when I realized what I had done with this gift I thought was a curse? Not at all. But it's never too late. It's only been three months and I already feel myself getting back to my old quicker self, which is a huge relief.

6- ***I don't have insomnia anymore***

7- Why waste all these efforts for 15 minutes of giggles and then 3 hours of drowsiness?

&#x200B;

**What I did when the cravings were too intense :**

1- Kundera said that humans became addicted to speed because it helps them run away from their problems. That's why most people walk insanely fast. But I noticed that when you take care of your inner problems and you become comfortable in your own head, if you slow your walking pace, your train of thoughts will slow down too. Every evening, at the time I would usually light up my after-work joint, I took long slow walks in my neighborhood, sipping on a sparkling water. That helped me find another way to manage my hyperactive brain.

2- Habits make things a lot easier. You're not using that part of your brain where choices are made. You have a limited number of choices in a day. Choices are tiring. Having a healthy routine and replacing your compulsive habits for good ones *THAT YOU ENJOY (really important)* is a huge help. For example, I've replaced afterwork joint for flavoured sparkling water and goldfish (the cheese crackers) or a slow walk in the city. It still counts as a reward but its a lot healthier. Find your own healthy sources of reward. It has to come from yourself to work. It's hard in the beginning, bit soooo worth the effort. Because it becomes effortless! My granma once said to me : *if you want to change the world, start by making your own damn bed.* A solid routine WILL change your life, and thats a promise. A year and a half ago, my morning routine was to wake up around 1 pm and my breakfast was a cigarette with a coffee. It's a whole other game now.

3- Birdwatching. I started that before quitting weed, but it helped considerably after. That helped me with hypervigilance. Instead of focussing on the scary noises, I recognize the bird's signing and I know which bird is in which tree. It made me reconnect with the beauty around me, soberly. I used what I thought was a bad trait as a superpower to be aware of nature.

4- There's an old addict trick that really helped me when cravings were the worst : saying to myself ""I'll smoke tomorrow"". Worked like a charm. I visualized myself in a specific situation, saying to myself : ""man if you last one more day, ONE MORE DAY, tomorrow we'll order junk food, wrap ourselves in a blanked, watch a stupid movie and play videogames all night, but come one man ONE DAY, you can do it!"" So the voice of craving was satisfied. The next day when it spoke again, I was saying to it : "" Come one man, you did it yesterday, it can't possibily be worst today. We've made it this far, let's try another day!"" and so on, ""manipulating"" myself to stop smoking weed.

5- Get in a car and scream. Weed becomes a reflex when you don't accept your emotions. It can be troubling when you stop and it bursts, so that helped a lot too.

6- (added june 8) Forgot this one : start a crave journal. Each time you have a craving, note precisely when it's happening and what is happening around you. I noticed the cravings were happening a lot at the same time of the day, or at certain context. You'll be much more in control and you'll feel safer if you can anticipate a situation that makes you vulnerable.  

7-(added june 8) Forgot this one too : the immense feeling of boredom you currently feel is because weed has become your hobby. A hobby is an activity you do to reward yourself, that makes you feel good. For example, I had a coworker who was passionate about mountain climbing. I could just feel his itch to go climb at the end of the day, the same itch I had to roll a big joint. Finding a new hobby can be tremendous, but it has to come from you! Something you truly enjoy doing. Before finding birdwatching, my hobby was trying new hobbies. Hobbies are fun! 

As time goes by for me, after three months, the cravings can sometimes be as bad but they are a lot less frequent. Two days ago was the last big test I had. That night, I had every triggers at the same time : bad news from the family, loss of a job (considerable alteration of my routine), a stoner friend from out of town was there, and with other friends we had a night of videogames and pizza. But I knew life doesn't give anything you can't handle. If all of that happened the same night, it was because I was ready. I have really understanding friends, and when I said I had stopped for three months, they were all stoked for me and didn't tempt me at all. I was grateful. And fucking proud of myself for getting home sober.

&#x200B;

I wish everyone of you the best of luck ! You can do this. YOU'RE STILL BREATHING! Your battle isn't over yet. You're a great warrior, a trooper for doing this. What looks like baby steps now will become enormous leaps foward.

But I will have it when I move to a new city on the 15th. Which is a little over a week from now. Last time I got high was 2 days ago. My body is craving it, and so is my mind. Even though it isn't enjoyable, I've recently just been smoking to make the time pass quicker, so maybe that 15th will get here sooner. But...I worry about my withdrawal symptoms. 

I'm moving into a coop, and...and I worry that my withdrawal symptoms will make me a problem. If I abstain and suffer through this intense loneliness, this extreme overwhelming depression, this insufferable boredom, etc., maybe I won't be a problem by then. Maybe the withdrawal symptoms will have subsided by then, especially with the biking I've been doing and the diet I'm on which apparently boosts your endocannabinoids. 

But now I'm convincing myself I just need to be mindful of my withdrawal symptoms, and if they become an issue to just communicate with those around me. Which is a good point. This last week here is near impossible, but I can easily survive the first 2 weeks there, surrounded by activities to take my time up: hiking, making friends, socializing, finding a new job, biking, exploring, everything I can't do now. But...will those withdrawal symptoms make those initial adventures less impactful? Will I enjoy them more or- no, because the point is that those things will become my norm. I can't explore an entire city in a month, anyways. And once my brain's back to normal, I can re-explore those initial areas.

But then I'm just hit with...it won't even be worth it, anyways, will it? The high. It's delta 8, anyways, not the good stuff. My CB1 receptors are so downregulated that I can't even have fun high, anyways. But...the time will certainly pass. It won't drag on forever and ever like it's doing now. Those 9 days, man, they feel like a lifetime away...all I have to escape from these cravings is biking and...I can't do that all day everyday.

I'm a high functioning addict, meaning that the consequences I face in my life because of my addiction are slow to surface, so much so that I often don't see them until it's too late. One thing I can say for certain is that when you quit, you will see the consequences of smoking when you sober up. Whether it's all of a sudden realizing you have energy and motivation to do things, or the fact that you don't crave McDonald's every night, or that you're not an awkward idiot in social situations. If you quit, even for a week or two, you'll see what you were when you were high all the time. And I promise, the high isn't worth everything you lose.

Don't focus on the difficulty of quitting when you're trying to. Is it hard to quit? Of course it fucking is, if it weren't, you wouldn't be here reading this, and I wouldn't be typing it out.

It helps so much with the anxiety that’s consumed me. - This is why I failed so many times before.. this and I was sort of just making “oh one night won’t hurt” excuses.. but that one night ALWAYS hurts. It always turns into NIGHTS and me feeling absolutely ashamed of myself. It’s never worth the 30 minutes-1 hour or so of being stoned. I ALWAYS awaken with a weed hangover.. feeling anxious, ashamed, foggy, and sad. 

If you’re having a craving tonight- look in the mirror at yourself. Remind yourself of every single storm you’ve gotten through. Remind yourself of your whys. Find something that you can occupy your time in! For me, my favorites are working out- woooh feel good chemicals!!, meditation, yoga, writing, art, reading, and studying.
Things that will leave me fulfilled and happy, clear minded, and proud of myself!

I’m going to write this post in the point of view of my mother asking to get help for her son. My mother died 5 years ago but I feel like taking advice that someone would give my mom will help me more than someone giving me advice meant for me.

(Me pretending to be my mom asking for advice)
Hello all! 45 year old Mom here. I have a son who’s 18M that’s going through some scary mental health and substance abuse issues.
His father had a lifelong problem with alcohol. Constantly in and out of rehab. He wanted to quit but couldn’t control himself. He physically abused me and was not there for the children, I had to divorce him. He committed suicide in 2013 when my son was 10 and daughter was 12. 
Later on I was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2015, I had my surgery and on May 20th, 2015, i would pass away and leave my children orphaned. 
I am now in heaven watching my son go through the exact same things his dad did. He cannot control himself with weed and nicotine. He is by himself 24/7 and drugs are the only gap he has in life. All of his happiness is artificial. 

(back to writing from my perspective)
My father had nobody in his life to help him with his alcohol problems. His parents weren’t there for him and all he had was his brother. It was not enough and he ended his life.
Now I look at my life. I have no parents, just like his parents weren’t there for him. I have no friends, my dad had very little friends. I am extremely addicted to weed and nicotine, my dad had these identical behaviors with cigarettes and alcohol. I have desire to quit but cannot go more than a few weeks or a couple months before relapsing and smoking 24/7. My parents have passed and all I have is my brother, who’s not enough. Just like my dad.
I understand now why my dad took his life. I didn’t understand until I started having addiction problems. It makes me wonder how he made it all the way to 46 dealing with the things I’m dealing with now. 

I understand that people argue weed isn’t addicting. Although I may not be chemically dependent on the drug, it’s all I have to fill the gap in my life of not having my parents or friends or anybody to talk to. My brother downplays my substance abuse and thinks I’m just getting high because I wanna get high. He uses the same drugs but without the addictive side, smoking maybe every other week and we have different dads. I know for a fact he’s never experienced these types of problems because if he did he would understand. I don’t abuse drugs because I want to get high, I abuse them because it’s the only thing that replaces the things I’ve lost and the lack of social contact I have. This is not who I am. This is not who I want to be. 

If weed is fucking me up this bad, I can’t imagine what my dad went through doing this on alcohol and if I ever touch any harder drugs after that, I’ll just prepare to die right then and there.

I’m just so scared I’m gonna end up like my dad because I’m already dealing with all this from ages 14-18 and I can’t keep going down this path. My dad was still smart and successful in his life but his addictive personality was too much for him to overcome.

Also I’ll add: I binged weed/nicotine/caffeine ever since I was 14. I’ve had 3 times in my life where I’ve completely quit and been clean, and then relapsed months later. 3 days ago I quit weed, planning on quitting nicotine next but I know I’m just gonna relapse again at some point in my next 60 years of my life, like I already have and like my father did.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.845705}"
2021-06-06 19:38:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ntys96/i_am_a_boss_now/,I am a BOSS now.,"Hi there beautiful people,

Murder of Crows here, aka Big Boss Raven.

Yesterday I did some bossy shit and it felt awesome.

A lil bit of a background first. I was addicted to weed for a decade and this year I've managed to take multiple breaks. The longest was one month.

Right now I am 17 days sober and I feel pretty good to be honest. The first week was hell I'm not gonna lie. I cried a lot listening to Lil Peep, watching puppy videos on YouTube and realising that I suck in general. The only withdrawal symptom that still persists is the insomnia thing. I am a vampire now but without the coffin. Whatever bruh. Sleep is for the weak anyway.

But a couple days before I started doing the Wim Hof method and I basically started to get high on my own supply. I will make a separate post about it because this shit is life changing and it deserves it's own special post.

So anyway, yesterday evening I was streaming some Call Of Duty Warzone on my channel when my roommate came downstairs to inform me that two drunken fools are throwing rocks at my window. I took a glance and I saw two friends of mine and they were kinda drunk/high/intoxicated. They knew I was doing that sobriety gay thing I'm doing now so they didn't invite me in case I have a relapse. Respect hommies. I invited them though just to chill for a while since I was about to end the stream anyways. 

So Mr. White and Mr. Pink came upstairs and it was awesome lol. 

Mr. White was a bit drunk and high on the Tony Montana stuff. And Mr. Pink was drunk and high on the devil's lettuce. And I was high on life. 

So everybody was high and we actually chilled for a couple hours and surprisingly I had a really great time with the mates! We discussed about sobriety, about why I am doing it but also sobriety in general. They respected me for doing that and the vibes were so positive that I had multiple mental orgasms. We teased each other and we laughed so much that blood started coming from our eyes instead of tears. It was super fun. 

But the best part and the main reason I'm posting this: I didn't relapse and I think the most important thing is that it never crossed my mind to relapse on weed which is my keystone habit. If I relapse on weed, everything else follows. And I felt great.

One great moment was when we were chilling in the kitchen. I was cooking for myself while Mr. White and Mr. Pink were standing there and talking to me high af when Mr. White told me that if I want them to leave because it's getting hard for me I can just say the word. I then realise that It never crossed my mind to relapse and I told Mr. White that I feel like a boss right now. I'm cooking something healthy for myself and I'm in total control right now and I am actually having a blast.  

Life is great guys. Don't do drugs mmmkay?

Just do some breathing and cold showers lol.

It’s triggering. By completely avoiding friends who do, I feel like it’s way easier to quit. For example I can control myself and not contact a dealer, but when at a friends house and weed is being offered for free, it’s so much harder. I’ve avoided it so far, but it drains my willpower. I feel like they think I’m judging them, and honestly I am. I don’t want anyone in my closest friends circle to be a pothead. Like the quote says, “tell me who your friends are and I’ll tell you who you are.”

I'm going to outline my journey, along with some things that I found difficult or some things that helped me.

I began smoking around the age of 17/18, and it quickly turned into an abusive habit that I used to escape reality. I really had nothing to escape from other than the average stress life brings - I just loved the feeling. Around December 2018 I decided this was a destructive habit and that I needed to quit if I wanted to progress in life and achieve my goals.

That was in 2018. It took me over 2 years to reach this point. I had countless quitting attempts and relapses along the way but I never gave up. Now I've reached 1 month which is the longest I've gone since 2018.

**Progress is not linear!**

Although I am not out of the woods yet, I believe that this will be my final quitting attempt. Weed (and alcohol) are not substances I can moderate, and once I accepted that it made it slightly easier. Anyways, enough about me - below I'll list a few strategies and tricks that worked for me. Please keep in mind that everybody is different and what worked for me may or may not work for you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Make your family & friends AWARE that you are an addict and want to quit**

This was the biggest one for me by far. All my previous attempts were a solo journey, and due to having nobody to hold me accountable or to check on me, I ended up relapsing every time. It's hard to do it alone because the addicted brain will trick you time and time again - you need a sober mind to help guide you. Believe me, I know it's hard to open up about this, but if you are in an environment where this is an option **DO IT!**

**Throw out EVERYTHING**

Seriously. This may seem like an obvious one, but for whatever reason, I read some posts on here of people keeping their bongs, papers, lighters, etc. **THROW IT ALL OUT!** If you are like me, weed is a destructive habit that you can **never** moderate - what's the point in keeping that temptation around the house?

**Exercise, exercise, exercise, and more exercise**

This was a big one for the first couple of weeks to help me sleep. If you can find the time, do yourself a favour and go on a 1-2 hour walk per day. Just a walk outdoors, it does not need to be an intense run. This helped my sleep so much I barely had any sleeping issues the first couple of weeks.

**Sweet treats to help curb cravings**

This trick really helped me, and hopefully, it can help some of you. Keep some chocolate bars, candy, ice cream - really whatever sweet snacks you enjoy around your house. Whenever you have a serious craving, go eat a treat instead and see how you feel after. Without fail, this trick curbed every single craving I had for the last month. All of my cravings were amplified if I was hungry, so just give it a shot!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That's it! That's my journey so far and what helped me along the way. I know I still have a long way to go, but I am finally optimistic and excited for my future. Hopefully, some of this can help you too, and if you have any questions just ask away. :)

It has been 4ish years of smoking daily, from wake n bake, pre gym / post gym, pre work / post work...etc. I smoked socially at first then gradually started smoking alone...fast forward and years later have become so addicted without grasping how much smoking weed affects me.
recently I realized that it’s literally half way through the year and as an female who should be confident and have friends and being getting out there, instead I’ve been stoned and alone and not coping with reality. 

I subconsciously decided to quit a few weeks ago, but of course stretched what I had to prolong the inevitable.

Smoking can give me some strange thoughts and make me do strange things but the real problem is the withdrawals. I don't sleep for days. I don't do much of anything but sit there dissociating and trapped in paranoid ruminating thoughts.

I last smoked two weeks ago. After a week of withdrawals it built up to a point that I was certain my roommates were about to beat me up and drag me outside, naked and bloody where a lynch mob would parade me through the streets, torturing me to death.

To save myself from that fate I grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed myself in the neck with all my strength. An easier death by comparison. This isn't the first time I've done this either. Last time I used a knife. I was lucky again this time and didn't hit anything vital. They just had to perform surgery to be certain.

10 years I've been doing this. Why the fuck am I still doing this? I know I have a very serious illness that isn't going to disappear even if I never touch another substance again in my life, but holy shit, who cares how good weed makes me feel when it contributes to such agony.

I've had some bad experiences with the mental health system so I've been off meds and out of treatment for a year or two. But I need help.

So I quit smoking for the first time in New Years this year. Was trying to get a new job in electrical work, and was successful at quitting for a few months. Started looking around at open shops and, as someone with no experience, got a few offers that paid less than I can live on and were super sketchy, basically “we will call you sometimes if we need an extra guy, no guarantees and we have to pay you under the table and can’t log your hours”. I got pretty dejected for a bit, then started looking into more official programs, decided to apply for a union apprenticeship. The next window wasn’t for a few months so I was like “fuck it I’ll just buy an 1/8th, it’ll be gone in a week and I’ll go back to not smoking.” 

So I went to the dispo, and buy the cheapest shit weed I can find, thinking maybe I will quit sooner if it’s not good bud. Get to the check out and there like “oh this is buy one get one” and just throw another one into the bag, plus a bag of edibles. I’m like whatever I’ll go through it before the application date anyways. But my tolerance is so low that it takes me a month to go through one. That’s one of the reasons we’re is so insidious, the cost scales up so quickly. When you have a low tolerance it can be a forty dollar a month habit, when it goes up your easily dropping a car payment a month. 

I was getting nervous when it came closer to the application date because I wanted to have a month clean for the drug test, which is just a urine test, although later in your career some companies that use union labor ask for a hair test so once I get the job that’s it between me and weed. Quit again, and it really wasn’t hard. 

I had been disappointed because quitting hadn’t magically solved all my problems. I didn’t suddenly get a better job and start cleaning my apartment more often or working out everyday. My life was the same I just didn’t smoke every night. The second time I quit made me realize it wasn’t that weed was causing my bad habits, it’s that it was keeping me from caring about them. It’s still going to be a lot of work to get to where I want to be, but at least I’ve started.

I passed my entrance exam, and got an interview date! And lo and behold it’s not for another month. I have been super stressed at work and decided that I was just going to stop on the way home and get a single preroll, just to unwind. 

On my way to the car I envisioned my afternoon. Getting high and doomscrolling Reddit, too anxious and out of it to even play a video game. 

Instead, I went to a hobby store and got some 40k models, tools, paints, and brushes. Cost me half of what smoking for a month used to. Went home and just straight up nerded out for the whole day into the night. I felt calm and relaxed in a way I haven’t felt for years. My problems, my disappointment in myself, were just far away.

Today I had a revelation, a flash of memory about why I had quit the hobby in the first place. I used to play the game the models are associated with in highschool, and I was always the worst at painting them of any of my friends. I was impatient and I don’t have a steady hand. But I got better over the years and eventually had a few models I felt really proud of. Like used to just stare at them and turn them over, feeling good.

 Started smoking and we all fell out of the hobby. Years later I bought a set again, thought “I liked doing this when I was younger, it’ll be even more fun high! That’s how drugs work, right?” I was totally disorganized, fucked up some of the pieces trying to get the model together, and it really fell to shit when I tried to paint. I slopped on way to much paint and ruined the detail on it, it was in unsalvageable. I felt stupid for trying to reconnect with something juvenile, and had repressed the memory that I had thrown the thing out in frustration. 

So much had I repressed the memory I didn’t even realize I had bought the exact same model again. I’m far from done with it, and there is a lot I want to improve on. I’m still not a great painter. Why would I be?But I’m learning from my mistakes and correcting them. It doesn’t have to be perfect, it doesn’t have to look as good as other people’s. It just has to be something I tried to make well. When I look at the little thing I feel proud, and that’s what counts. 

This little chunk of fantastical plastic is my life. It’s not where I want it to be, but it’s a start. The next try I’m going to do even better.

I genuinely believed that I did not have it in me to quit. I genuinely believed that I was only ""me"" if I was stoned silly. What a damn JOKE!

Round 1: I quit last December for 14 days and genuinely surprised myself. Decided to take ""one hit"" to celebrate that I was even capable of going more than a couple hours without a toke... and was immediately back to smoking nearly an eighth a day.

Round 2: I decided to be sober on Christmas day and stayed off it through to my birthday on the 24th of Jan, so I made it a month. I believe it was 4 days into this one where I made my first encouraging post on this sub. This was BY FAR the longest I had ever gone since I was 14. This was an extremely emotional roller coaster of a month, with all sorts of suppressed emotions rising from the shadows. But I stuck to it.. until my birthday. Again, ""just one toke to celebrate"", and I was straight back to an eighth a day. GOD DAMMIT. This lasted for another 4 months. A third of a year! What happened to all of that progress? Maybe I was subconsciously afraid of the continual push through suppressed emotions and I avoided them.

Round 3: Decided I had had enough and quit again on May 4th. May the fourth be with me I told myself. Made it to day ten and my roomie was having an existential crises/full on anxiety attack. He knew I wasn't smoking but he asked me politely if I would sit out in our yard and have a toke with him. I told him no, but that I would be more than glad to sit out there with him to offer support... until I realized that he had brought home some Duct Tape - literally my all time favorite strain, I hadn't seen it around for months. So I caved and got very high with him. I was glad to be there for him and told myself that I wouldn't beat myself up for slipping and would just wake up the next morning and continue my sober journey. FALSE. I bought a gram the very next morning and proceeded to get baked as all hell for the next two weeks. Hmmm... maybe I really actually don't have any control over this. I finally decided I have a complete inability to moderate my weed usage in any way, shape, or form.

ROUND 4!!: I had my last toke on May 29, making the 30th my first sober day. That makes this day 7. Already the anxiety is diminishing. The depressed feelings are subsiding. My energy is coming back and I feel pretty darn clear headed. My drams are coming back. The suppressed emotions/traumas oddly seem WAY easier to deal with this time around. What in the world is the difference this time? I think it is that I have finally let go of the notion that I can return to Mary Jane occasionally and moderate once I have enough time under my belt. Its like a monkey off my back in a way. For the first time in my life I am looking at weed as just ""something"" out there in the world, rather than something I have always attributed to my own personality. 

Moral: I guess it just may be a simple truth that relapse is really just part of the process for a lot of people, and that the experience of relapse can be a teacher of sorts. Its like ""hey THIS is why you quit the first time man!"" Its gotten easier each time, and really I just had to teach myself to ""WANT to be sober"" because it really is.... BETTER! After nearly 20 years of chronic usage I just had to retrain my mind to want something else... and that takes TIME and PRACTICE.

I really feel like I have it this time. I still crave it daily, but that is just my addictive mind trying to trick me. I am prepared to tell that voice in my head to fuck off, because it isn't actually me its just a damn monkey. BYE BYE LITTLE MONKEY! I am better than that and I know it now.

As always, Stay Fresh my friends. Love you all.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46331823}"

Hi. I’m 28, from texas. Specially Houston. If you know anything of the area, it is heavily influenced by weed/rap/hip hop/country culture. I started smoking at 15. The reason for this was, I was in highschool, and my girlfriend at the time was a partier. I was against drinking and drugs, not bc they were bad but just bc I didn’t do them so I didn’t want her to be going to parties and cheating and all that. Needless to say that was a failed effort, which caused me to seek out why these substances were so “cool”. When I started smoking dro wasn’t an everyday thing like it is now. My best friend at the time was still in school and I decided to drop out, but our daily routine was for me to pick him up after school, head to the dealers house, and smoke an ounce of regs between the 2 of us. Every day another ounce. Eventually we dabbled in other drugs, which led to me having an overdose. In the hospital I even asked the doctor if I could still smoke weed if I quit other drugs. That should have been sign 1. I quit all drugs for about a year, and since then have continued to stay off all of them. Except weed. I picked it back up, and got a job as a body piercer in a tattoo shop, a place surrounded by weed and drug culture. I smoked for around a year and then quit again, I even became straight edge, professing my beliefs in anti substance. Until I moved to Katy tx, and got a job in another shop where a woman was working who was what u would call a “hippy” old long grey hair and smoked like a chimney. She brough my roommate and I 4-5 ounces of colorado medical. Needless to say I broke edge. We smoked for around another year until I realized that my life was going nowhere. I quit my job, moved back home and quit weed. I lived at home and was jobless for 4 years, but that was 4 years clean off weed. I still drank on occasion at dinners or holidays but I never felt I had a problem with drinks. I never drank consistently. Then I met a woman got married, got a job as an overnight truck unloader at Home Depot. Once again a place filled with drug users like myself, I quit the job in February 2020 before covid and separated from my wife. I have tried to quit smoking numerous times before the marrige ended and numerous times since. I finally feel like this is the final time, yet I feel like that every time. I can’t stay off for to long, I have serious withdraw symptoms including diarrhea, extreme cold sweats and loss of appetite, my last time trying to quit before today was a month ago and I couldn’t eat for 5 days yet still had profuse diarrhea. So I bought another sack. And let me also mention I don’t smoke small. I roll joints as full as they can fit, or multiple bowls. 3 days ago I lit a joint and felt like I was not getting stoned. I was high, but the feeling I got was as if I smoked an hour ago. I woke up the next morning with a stomach ache that I still have right now, and won’t leave no matter what I do. I don’t know if I have caused permanent damage, I have not seen a doctor nor feel like I should go through all of the covid protocol bs required to see a family doctor over a drug induced stomach ache. Here’s to hoping I stay off for good and that you do too.",8,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.53055334}"

My sisters always smoked around me when i was younger and showed that weed was okay even though its completely illegal where I live. 

My oldest sister invited me to her room one day to smoke with here when I was around 13 or 14 because she saw how depressed and anxiety ridden i was all the time. At first, I didnt like being high. It made me feel funny. I waited about 2-4 months and tried it again. Once I convinced my parents to give me money all the time, I started buying it myself and smoking with my friends and sometimes even stealing my sisters bud. I continued almost every single day, using it multiple times a day, along with friends I had and today, I am 19 years old, about to be 20 in 2 months. 

I didnt want to quit. I didnt see a point in it because I already have a decent job that doesnt test. I dont have any career plans yet. But, my boyfriend of almost 3 years decided to quit a bit over a month ago. We smoked everyday together. We met while drinking and smoking at a friends house. Its something we did when we were bored or had a rough day. We would smoke about 3 blunts a day together. We were happy but we didnt like how much money we spent and now he wants to persue a career, though he doesnt know what exactly, yet.  

I lost my grandma about 2 weeks ago. Her funeral was on the 1st. I quit smoking on the 2nd. Every single day, waking up, I want to smoke but i try to remind myself that I cant. The more days that pass, it becomes easier but the withdrawal symptoms dont. My boyfriend never had any withdrawal symptoms but we have been smoking for about the same amount of time, he might have even been smoking for longer. 

I always smoked to help with my anxiety and sadness. Just getting past a bad day, or even if I had a good one, there was the celebratory blunt. 
I feel like I have more anxiety now than ever. I dont want people to be near me. I start shaking sometimes. The past 2 days i have woken up with the worst headache and i cant shake them. 

I guess I just wanted someone to hear all of what I'm dealing with. 

I still dont want to quit but my brain is trying so hard to convince me that its the right thing but on days I dont work, I get so lonely and stuck in my head. 

I know this is a lot to read and most of it is me rambling, but to whoever does read it, thank you for your time. 

I dont have many friends and it seems like this was a place i could let out all of my words without being judged.

A hole of self-doubt, being easily agitated, ruining careers and friendships is the only way to describe it, having to constantly organize my life around getting high and bailing out on things when I couldn't get high there.
I've been a heavy daily smoker for about 12 years now and two years ago I finally realized it was a problem and needed to stop.  With this realization I tried and tried to quit but never made it more than two days without the stuff. I always made an excuse, smoked up, and then spent the next week or two in a violent cycle of smoking and being incredibly hard on myself.  It has been an emotionally taxing two years being locked in a battle with this demon and feeling that I'd never be able to overcome it.  Started having some really dark and sad thoughts about my constant failure to quit and starting applying that lens to every aspect of my life.  I finally realized that i needed help and opened up to a friend about my struggle/thoughts and was blown away when he invited me on a week long clean camping trip.  Between canoeing and hiking all day I was exhausted and entertained and happy with the simplicity of everything I had been neglecting.  Two days during the trip it poured rain and I didn't even mind. I didn't really struggle to sleep or with the boredom in the ways I had in the past.  The moment i got home from the trip I threw out my grinder, papers, and all that other garbage and haven't looked back.
It's now been three weeks clean.  THREE WEEKS CLEAN, I'm over the moon. I had my first dream last night, it was so strange and foreign, I bolted upright in the middle of the night confused as to what was happening and then had a little happy cry before falling back to sleep.
This was - by far - one of the most challenging things I have ever had to do in my life and I know the journey is far from over but I honestly hope I never touch the stuff again.  I feel my motivation returning, I feel mentally quicker and more witty, I'm starting to eat a lot better, and am starting to dream again.  I know quitting weed won't solve all my problems or make me a better person in itself but it's such a massive step in the direction towards a life that I feel comfortable and content with.

To everyone starting down the journey of quitting don't be hard on yourselves; it's a scary world when you're tearing yourself apart from the inside out.  
REACH OUT TO PEOPLE.  Whether in-person or through these online communities find someone to talk to and open up with.  I was so embarrassed because weed (being Canadian) is so casual to so many people that I assumed it should be something I can just walk away from no problems.  I assumed no one else struggled the way I did and that couldn't be farther from the truth.  This community painted my struggle in such a new light and gave me lots to think about but the act of overcoming my fear and opening up to someone is ultimately what finally made this all possible. I think sometimes I just like to suffer.  Before this subreddit I don't think I ever would have told anyone in person that I was struggling and am eternally grateful I took that armour off and admitted I needed help.  There are truely beautiful people in the world who will always be there for you if you can extend that olive branch.
Lastly, and ultimately not available to everyone, but there is a lot to be said about a change of scenery.  Heading out into the forest for a week completely took the act of quitting out of my head while actually being able to get through those first few days.

I'm excited and I feel as if I have this new energy running through me, I'm smiling all the time and feel so free.

I had a good day in general but in the evening, my friends live-streamed a DJ set and they played all of my favourite songs for me. I did the visual show remotely and it was just the most magical feeling of euphoria (the music was all trance and happy hardcore, basically our friendship in a set). 

It's made me realize just how much more emotional I feel when I'm sober. This can take many forms - sadness where I want to cry all the time, anxiety and panic, but this is completely balanced out by moments like this. Truly a spectacular feeling. 

My only concern right now is the same one I always have when quitting - will I ever smoke weed again? The same people who gave me this beautiful evening were some of my best smoking buddies, but our friendship will always live on without weed. However, they don't have a problem with it like I do and I know there will come a time soon when they offer me a joint. It will be really hard to turn down, to the point where I feel like the sentimental value will actually outweigh me wanting to 'permanently quit'. I want to smoke on these moments and then live the rest of my hours sober, but we all know it's not that easy.

I still remember the first time I got high at my friend's place, hotboxing in the bathroom while the parents were away. Little did I know the toll it would take on me later. I even got expelled from high school in my final year because of it. 

At about mid twenties we were smoking at work... by 31 I was smoking from the time I woke up until the time I went to sleep. It got so crazy I started getting panic attacks from smoking weed... I remember having to go to the first aid room at a Korn concert because I felt like i couldn't breath enough. (Eventually calming down enough to enjoy the rest of the show)

Lost 14k worth of a Jamaican 2 week new year's trip (could only stay about three days because I was freaking out pacing the room etc). Spent new year's eve on a plane home. (Amazingly my now wife said yes in the first class lounge when I asked her to marry me on the way home)

I had already been off weed then just before that trip. Had no idea that I'd get withdrawl like that. Back then no one ever talked or even knew PAWS with weed. I went through at least 4 months of just brutal anxiety, and then a few more of more manageable times. Doctors were no help (actually more harm at that time with other meds). By summer I got well enough to make a big move away from our home city into BC... From there things got better and better and by Christmas, almost a full year later I was pretty much all good. 

Then I'm not sure how long it was, maybe a year or two, after turning down joints a lot, and pretty much no one ever offering to me anymore... I decided ""Well, maybe just one toke. If I only do a toke like once or twice in 6 months I'll be ok."" Very big mistake. I wish I could reach back and smack myself senseless...

That one toke turned into another (almost) 20 years of use... I always kept it more on the low side though. Just literally like one small toot, one little bowl hit... Maybe just once a day... Usually after work... (Along with a couple rye's) I even got into a medical grow license and had my own garden. 

Last year I had some weird shit start happening in March where I was constantly having to clear my throat. Evenings were the worst. Got so bad I had to lay down on the couch because if I sat up it just got really bad. I'm sure it freaked out my family... It freaked me out... A couple of times I thought about going to emergency because it felt like my airway was being blocked. Went to ENT doc... Eventually figured out it was prob silent reflux. Booze and weed can loosen your stomach opening to your throat... So to get better I had to quit drinking and weed. 

This time around, I did have a couple times after a toke where I did start to get ""life concerns"" or thoughts... Heavy stuff like how much longer I have to live... How much longer will my parents be around... That would lessen after the initial high came down..  never when I was not high.. but no panic attacks etc like what made me quit last time. If the stomach stuff didn't happen I might still be smoking today... 

So November 2020 I stopped drinking and smoking cold turkey. (I actually start my sober day count from Dec 8th, as that's the first day I felt the harsh anxiety starting...) 

Along with that, I also started a crazy strict diet of no fatty or acidic foods because of the silent reflux. I proceeded to lose about 30 pounds and the withdrawal from the weed and booze really didn't help with my anxiety and paranoia about the food I was eating. I had to start counting calories to make sure I was getting enough to keep myself going and not lose any more weight. 

Those first four months were a pretty intensely bad and dark time. Anxiety and depression.. Covid, not being able to see anyone for help... My doctor did all he could. My wife is an angel. I'm not sure what I would have done without her. Probably would have had to go back home to my parents for a bit. Seriously, at 51 years old.. crazy bad time. I couldn't even handle making my own dinners etc. Sleep was almost non existent. In fact even now almost 6 months in, we still aren't back to the same bed together yet. Just because she'd wake me up and I'd probably keep her up too. 

Now I'm just about 6 months in and I'm finally starting to feel better about my progress really coming along. I can listen to music again. (Not all the stuff I liked yet, but good happy type music), watch tv shows and movies I couldn't handle before. 

The stomach issues have gotten a LOT better, pretty much back to how I was before it started... 

Through all of this I did a LOT of walking the dog... Sometimes 8-10km a day. I still really feel like a NEED to go out for those walks but now that the weather is better I get out on the mountain bike around three times a week now. 

I'm not totally there yet... Still dealing with the anxiety almost every day but it's way less than it was. Got a psychiatrist and a counselor now... I'm able to contribute to dinner making again... Things aren't as dark and hard as they were. I'm healing and growing into my new sober self again... 

I'm looking forward to July and August and feeling even better by then... I have a goal of getting well enough to be able to handle a camping trip I do every fall... (Getting ready and planning etc is pretty tense for me still) 

Things can be pretty tough when you start, but they do get better. You really find out what you're made of when you go through something this tough. For me it's the second most difficult time of my life... And it will be the last time I ever have to go through it... Because now I know I never ever want to do it again...

Still, I miss weed and miss being high all the time despite how much of a detriment it is on my life. Initially quitting was so hard, that is true. I am learning how hard the long battle of maintaining sobriety is when the initial support from friends and family wanes and you aren't even seen or treated as an addict because of how ""harmless"" weed is. It feels like the strength of cravings hasn't gone down, just the frequency over time. I hope I can one day not even think of being high or desire it. I find myself overeating more than I used to and craving alcohol (I hardly drink but want to feel fucked up) and it scares me when this void in substance abuse was created that I might develop other more unhealthy habits. 

Anyways, just wanted to jot down how my experience with how quitting weed has been. I see some people doing really well this far into sobriety, and other people struggling.

I used every time I got anxious, which as many of you all may know leads to use weed all the time. I don't even know why I used it sometimes, I would just be useless to me and others around me. I really wanted to get sober after my girlfriend broke up with me due to my usage, I still love and I keep telling myself that I'm making progress for me not for her. Going to college also doesn't help a lot, it's a breeding ground for substance abuse and I feel so lonely and detached from people. I'm very lucky to have friends who support me and want me to get better, when I went to my first NA meeting a friend of mine came with me. I also see a therapist for substance abuse.

It's really hard, every time I see her I have an urge to get high or drink to forget about her. Last night was an example of this. I saw my ex as I was leaving work, and I felt so anxious that I didn't know what to do. I immediately went to a bar and got drunk pretty quickly, then chain-smoked like 6 cigarettes. I felt good drunk, but I soon realized I had no plans to get home safely. I was fortunate enough to have a co-worker let me crash at his place on his couch. I feel so embarrassed and mad at myself for getting drunk like that.  I feel as if I'm always taking steps backwards when I go forward in my progress to my substance abuse. 

I know I'm getting better slowly, but I feel as if it's going to slow. I want this to be over and done, but good things take time. I hope to hear from you all soon, and I would love to help people on their journey with sobriety as well. :)",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38457894}"

I'm a 24 yo dude from south of France, been smoking regularly for 10 years. Now that I'm older I am not limited by money so I've been smoking every single day from awakening to before bed for the last 3 month and before that it was kind of the same, but I've traveled a lot so I had month without smoking but as soon as I settled somewhere for 3 month, someone would offer and I would relapse, my demons followed 

The weird thing is I've already went by a nihilist phase when I was hopeless and smoking to ignore the real world, but I got out of it at 19 in a extrem way, I was still smoking but I was working out every day and bettering myself, I found a job in a 4 star hotel, that allowed me to travel later.
Now, 5 years later, i monitor every minute of my life with google calendar and if I don't work out 3 hours a day I feel bad since I started boxing 1.5 year ago, no one can believe I'm a weed smoker as I'm fucking ripped and a damn good boxer even tho I havent been boxing  sober for so long

But a week ago after another argument with gf, I woke up the same way I did before 19, with no will to live asking myself why I fuckin woke up instead of dying in my sleep, I still go to the gym and I ran so much 2 days ago that an old wound to my foot came back and I cannot box for some time and even tho, I don't have enough motivation to do so
And it had became the goal of my life I wanted to travel the world and become a martial art Master, it had been my reason to live for 1.5 year and now I'm back to square one, and I know that I feel like this because weed is taking over my life and goals, I have tried to stop so many times but I'm so filled with rage, anxiety when I stop for 20 hours, I feel like I'm gonna die for real. My mom told me recently that she and her father were bipolar and she suspects I'm might have it too, and I think it kind of make sense that it was auto medication allowing me not to go crazy during depressed episode as I understood that my extreme motivation and excessive orderliness might be the signs of the manic episodes

Building up good gut bacteria, eating lots of oatmeal, tons of water, chicken whole foods. Having a healthy gut influences the hormones that affect sleep.

I’m making positive changes in my life for my myself and my family and quitting pot is on my list. I want to wait until I’m done moving because quitting will make me anxious while having withdrawal symptoms and I want the most stress free environment to go through that. 

I’ve been smoking for roughly 6 years, the last 3 years I’ve smoked pretty much daily minus a few breaks here and there. I can handle the night sweats, anxiety, nausea, and lack of appetite because I’ve quit before and know mostly what to expect. It’s the nightmares I know I will have a hard time handling. 

To make a long story short I had an abusive ex who I left a couple years ago who I also have restraining order against. Recently I’ve tried quitting and after a few days of completely not smoking (no matter how much I taper down days before) I have terrible and extremely vivid dreams of my ex coming to find me. Or dreaming that I’m back in that abusive relationship with him and can’t get away. It was a very dark time in my life and it’s so hard for me to quit knowing that those dreams might come back because I’m doing so well now. It’s caused me to keep smoking because I do not have these nightmares if I’m smoking.

I understand I probably need counseling or therapy because of the trauma from my ex, but I shouldn’t be smoking because of my job (which is one of the reasons I want to quit smoking) and I’m afraid by telling a therapist that I smoke it might somehow get back to my job.

I don’t like talking about my past abusive relationship because there’s so much stigma around it, so i haven’t really talked to anyone about this problem. I would just like to know if the nightmares might gradually get better the longer I’ve quit and I just need to tough it out, or if maybe there’s something I can do to reduce these nightmares while going through my withdrawal.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.611095}"

I think because I prepared a LOT, read up on bad withdrawal symptoms etc and had a lot of tools to help me get through. Plus I was majorly motivated and excited about my new life. (Been a daily smoker for about 17 years.) 

Life has just been really testing me the last four days, with massive changes in my work life, bad fights with my boyfriend, and just a bunch of stress and tension that, well, I don’t know how to handle.

I almost caved last night. But one tool in my kit that helped: I let myself do exactly what I would have done if I was high: veg out in front of “guilty pleasure” TV for a few hours, and eat some “comfort food.” Ate way less than if I had been stoned (like WAY less lol) but it did really help to not feel pressure to be productive or anything. Oh and also key: I was able to be by myself. No pressure to make conversation or deal with anyone else’s emotions or stresses. I know that’s selfish, but I just get so exhausted with other people sometimes, I think partly because I don’t have a lot of tools to deal with my own BIG emotions and stresses. Adding someone else’s just drains me completely.

Have others experienced this? Motivation etc got you through the first few days, but then it gets harder? A lot of people say the first few days are the worst, but not me.

Having been a shy kid at school with a small friend group I loved the doors this plant seemed to open up for me socially. I completely bought into the cannabis culture and by the time I reached 17 I was a daily user, and surrounded myself with like minded people. I have given 20 years of my life to this plant and it has given me great times, but I also believe it has cost me a lot, not only financially. 

I've always seen myself as a fairly 'high functioning stoner', but in reality that's nonsense. I've always had the tendency to accept mediocrity in my life. Half arsed attempts at long term achievements that I bail on, and then bury my head in the sand with months of smoking weed to suppress the emotions that failure brings. 

I've also had numerous attempts to quit over the years, some more successful than others, but never a complete success. What always scares me about these previous quit attempts is how driven I can be at times to let go of this addiction, but yet how easily I can fall back into the trap of everyday use. How easily another 2 - 3 years can roll on by until the next attempt.

I now find myself at 35 years old, my last quit attempt was from November 2019 to June 2020. I genuinely thought that was the one, i was convinced I had cracked it, but during a weak moment whilst we were in lockdown in the UK I convinced myself that one time wouldn't hurt. That this was unprecedented times and that I deserved something to take the edge off. 1 year later, and probably around £2000 spent, I find myself 14 days into what I hope is my last attempt. I'm convinced that this is the one, I want to let go of this addiction and experience a life beyond the daily ritual of looking for moments to get high, but I also know that I've been here before and how quickly my mindset can change. 

I'm not 100% sure what the direction of this post is for. Its more for me to get my thoughts down but also to share another story on what is a great support network here in Leaves. I've never really had support in any of my previous attempts, as like most people, I've never been completely honest with my loved ones on the degree of my use. I have an amazing wife who I'm sure knows I have a toxic relationship with weed, but not the extent of the hold it has had on my life. I've always been a sneaky stoner, taking hits when no one's around. Spending more money than I'd admit to anyone. I know that this needs to be the last time. I can't waste another 20 years doing this. 

Im hoping with the support in this forum it can help push me through the harder days. Those times of weakness that I've succumbed to in the past and gone back to my old ways. I know that I'll miss it, I always do, but I need to learn to accept that it can't be a part of my life anymore. That 'one hit' just isn't possible with me.

It's been 2 years since I quit smoking. Here, I'd like to share my story with you. Maybe it'll help someone to quit smoking.

The reason I quit smoking was a bust by police and weed is still strictly prohibited in my country. This means that I've got 1-year probation because of drug possession and went with seminars, surprise urine & blood tests, etc.

After I got caught, my dealer also busted but not because of me, because of himself. The other stupid shit is in the police station he talked, snitched everybody including me (I was the buyer but he already snitched big guys either), and confessed the crime.

When the court time has come up, I was called as a witness (stupid idea...) and he was sentenced to 15 years of prison time. Also, until the court day, everybody from his family and other dealers called me unlimited time and was saying ""take back your statement"" etc. Anyway, finally I didn't do it (because I was with my lawyer during declaring the statement) he got the prison time, changed the number, and moved to another place in the same city. Nobody is calling me anymore.

But in these 2 years, many things have changed in my life. As you can guess, the first months were stressful. So much stressful because of the pressure of drug dealers, court shit, probation things, and many of them. Also, I had to work (working as a software engineer). I couldn't handle it in the first place. Went to the doctor, I did tell the story, he prescribed some kind of medicines and I was taking them.

In that process, for the first 3-4 months I was really want to smoke. Wanted to smoke like crazy. But I didn't, took my medicines instead. It wasn't easy. I was having a hard time getting focused on my job and other things. Even my sex life has affected me. Every music I listen to (mostly listening to electronic, techno), every place I go, every comedy movie/series was remembering me smoke.

In the 6th month, finally, I started to having fun with another thing. Like playing video games, chatting with friends, watching movies, reading books (weed also caused not reading books), doing exercises. I was still taking my medicines but felt like I was okay with that situation.

1st year, I started to focus on my job and my technical skills. Improved me so much. Took training, got some exams. Promoted two times in a year! Could you believe that? Because I was aware, I was discovering my potential.

6 months after 1st year, my company was considering giving me an opportunity as a team leader. BTW, my managers already knew about my situation, the weed thing, medical helps I took. But the team leadership wasn't a charity, I earned that.

For now, I got a new job offer from a company which is based in Germany. I'm preparing myself to change my country, having a new life in a different country, and exploring myself at the next level. I also inspired a couple of my ""stoner"" friends and they also quit as well. One of them is not smoking for 3 months, another one for 1 year.

I'm telling you fellas, stay strong. Do not get back to smoking weed if you did quit once! Okay, I accepted it, maybe it wasn't get caught by police maybe I wouldn't quit and my life still would be miserable but I'd think like it was okay. A couple of my friends still smoking weed in front of me but I don't care. When I fall, there is always a different way to get up. I saw it, felt it, lived it.

Live your life, find something another to do. Get a hobby, do exercises, shape yourself, eat healthily. Life provides much more than that. And get professional help, don't be afraid. This is why doctors exist.

PS: My smoking frequency was too high. I spent tons of money (I could buy a car...), wasted too much time. I was a 24/7 smoker. But it doesn't matter. When it destroys your life it doesn't matter how much you smoke.

Also, OFC, I'm not telling to anyone ""don't smoke"". It's up to you. Some people are using cannabis for medical purposes. I'm not a doctor, I'm not capable of giving medical advice.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6175132}"

So I decided to talk about my path. It’s funny... when you’re in it, all you do is talking about weed, smoking and when you’re not smoking you think about the next time you’ll be smoking. Addiction... I paradoxically discovered weed in law school. I smoked from 2016 to late 2019. When I graduated I took a year before getting a job to rest and play video games cause I had not the time back then. (After studying 5/6 years I had to take a break). At this time I smoked a lot more. When I got my first job I decided to only smoke during the week end. 6 months later it was everyday. My girlfriend who’s a smoker too told me once « why are you always talking about that », it triggered me, I really hate that thought. I slowly started to take myself on another path. I hated the way I looked, smoking was time consuming (I think what I liked the most was the idea to smoke, I was really excited and happy when I was lighting my joint, the first minutes were pure joy then when you’re done you’re just high af and useless to yourself and the others...) it’s also health draining, and a motivation killer. It was enough for me. In between my girlfriend left me. I was so mad and sad at the same time, tried my best to convince her not to leave but you can’t do that much in those situation that’s just life... I tried my best to move on so I used that anger and turned it to motivation to quit cigaret and weed. I was skinny too so I put a bit of my frustration into food. The first nights were awful cause I used to smoke one before bed. After 4/5 days the sleep came easily. I started dreaming again (if you wanna talk lucid dreams too I’d like it 😊), I had more and more energy so I started sport again (swim, walk, run and a lil bit of work out cause I wanted bigger arms). My appetite came back. In a year I changed so much I can’t even count the number of wins it brought to my life. Mind and body (better face better skin) a huge amount of money saved. Everything was good to take. My family and friends were so proud and amazed by what I’ve done. My fight against this double addiction is one of the thing I’m the most proud of. Please guys never give up, the reward is insane, it lead you to the best virtuous circle ever. being proud of yourself, impressed by yourself is the best feeling I’ve ever experienced and it gave me wings for the rest of my life. The power of will became so real to me. I wish you the same paths brothers. But don’t be mad at yourself for smoking in the first place, we don’t make a mistake we just had an experience.

As I knew it would, life got miserable again. I had 5 months sober before and felt great, then the pandemic hit, and I made the big mistake. I had been trying to ween off for a while, only smoking maybe .4 at night for a month, but honestly that didnt seem to do anything besides send me into withdrawals during the day and reset them at night. So I cold turkeyed it 4 days ago. Like I said, I've quit before (twice, actually, and felt good) then somehow slipped back after a few months. It's crazy how my addict brain tries and usually succeeds to block the memories of my first quits, like the timeline of symptoms, insisting that I'll always feel this way and won't get better. I know that's not true, but it's hard to remember sometimes. By far my two least favorite symptoms are depression/anhedonia (seem to come together) and total lack of appetite, which are particularly bad right now. It absolutely sucks ass to not be able to enjoy games/movies/books, or to have a beautiful plate of food in front of you with no desire to touch it; makes me feel completely hopeless. I see lots of varying accounts of this, but I'd like to hear from anyone how long these two symptoms lasted for them. I have been exercising as much as I can with no energy, walking about 30 minutes a day and doing jumping jacks and pushups a couple times a day. Forcing myself to eat probably one meals worth of food throughout the day. Also, just read the post about drinking lots of water to increase the body's need for sodium, which I started today (on 5/8 big cups). Sorry for the rambling, I'm still very foggy of course. But any reassurance that these things pass, or when they do, would definitely help me right now.

A few days ago a friend put me on a ton of motivational and mindset material   and I know it sounds crazy but it has changed my life!

I realize now  that life is not about being in a pleasure state but in fact Life is about creating the best version of ourselves and giving that person to others. Ultimately that is where TRUE joy and happiness can be found. But our best version of ourselves only occurs thru growth, and growth is obtained through action, pain and hard work. 

Every day I have gotten up and followed a strict tough schedule. I workout hard, eat clean and reflect/journal. I feel like a different kind of addict all of a sudden. I’m addicted to self improvement, awareness and truly trying to master myself and thoughts.

 I'm mostly curious it anyone has been in a similar situation where they've used a sleep device to track sleep pre/post weed.

I've had a pretty rough go of sobriety these past few months. Lots of ups and downs, lots of failures, relapses and restarts. 

This latest stint of sober days has been... uncomfortable. I spent the first 3 or so days feeling awful, hating myself and trying everything to justify not quitting right now. I got really mad whenever I was prevented from sneaking weed or booze into my room, even though i knew it was a bad choice. I got irrationally angry that my lovely parents wouldn't just leave me alone to self destruct in peace, even though i was the one who asked for help. Go figure.

But something has started shifting, around day 4 i started realising that i was feeling better. I've been here before, several times, and the good feeling always fades into apathy that leads to a relapse. But something different is happening now. I'm realising that being sober is what's making me feel better. That every day I'm sober is another day closer to feeling good, to feeling great. And it makes me want to jump with joy! 

I know theres a bumpy road ahead of me. I know I have months to go before my brain and body have healed from what I've put them through. But the decision is now clear in my mind: weed was what made me feel bad and sobriety is what's making me feel better. And every time I remember that I'm sober, the wave of relief that comes over me is like... *ahhh*. My body and brain, my whole being is breathing a sigh of relief. 

The mind can be described as an elephant and a rider. The elephant is the ancient, largely emotional part of the brain, the rider a younger, logical, conscious part. Often it seems the rider is in control of where to go, until the elephant disagrees. Then theres nothing the rider can do to move the elephant and the illusion of control is gone. That's why it takes time and slow convincing to change emotions but conscious thoughts can change fast. I have known consciously that weed was making me feel bad for a long time, but now I think I'm starting to feel it. My elephant is slowly turning around.

I guess that's all I wanted to say. Theres a light at the end of the tunnel, and I finally feel like I'm walking towards it.

Really inspiring! Also i wanna acknowledge that changing your environment is often something easier to do if you have privelege.

So I’m easily into month three now, and tbh it’s only been possible because I’ve moved in with my girlfriend in a countryside location, living away from most of my friends in a very controlled environment. 

For me, this has been the only way I can KNOW that I won’t be tempted, because right now it would literally be impossible for me to score without it being like a huge ordeal. 

Makes me think that possibly the best advice for those starting up on their journey is to put serious measures in place that will make getting high that much harder on a day to day basis.

This has been the only fool proof way for me (living with my partner is basically rehab) and whilst I know I’ll have temptation again in the future, at least I’m banking serious time right now, where I’m learning, exercising, taking care of myself and detoxifying like mad after a really heavy year of smoking (floaters in my eyes are actually nearly gone).

Turns out weed is the cause and it will only get worse unless I stop,"For several years I have been smoking weed daily. I always make the excuse that I am using it as medicine - for anxiety, for nausea, for depression, for any kind of mental or physical discomfort. I always saw it as a Band-Aid that didn't fix anything but got me through some tough times. I've always tried to improve my situation and the underlying causes, with the aim to eventually not be dependent on this substance.

Lately, the main thing that keeps me using is near constant stomach pain and nausea. It comes and goes, but it has been getting worse over the past year and I've had to call in sick from work frequently. I've been seeing my doctor but he has no solutions and it has been feeling really hopeless. He just says I must be constipated and prescribes laxatives, and obviously that just makes things worse.

I've been doing research because I never ever felt like this before I used weed daily. Also my diet etc is healthy and hasn't changed. I figured either I have a serious disease or weed must somehow be the culprit. Turns out there is something called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome - characterized by episodes of severe nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting that returns every few weeks and months. These symptoms perfectly match what I have been experiencing. Apparently it is common for doctors to not have a clue, and for patients to increase their marijuana use to find temporary relief. It can take months of sobriety to let the body return to normal but that is the only treatment.

It turns out all along that weed is causing the main thing I keep using it to treat. Every time I've tried quitting I have caved because weed is the only thing that releaves the symptoms short-term. Now I know I need to power through and if I stay sober for weeks or months, eventually my body will go back to normal.

If anyone else has been experiencing chronic nausea, stomach pain, and inflammation I would strongly advise looking into CHS and understanding that cutting weed out is the only real solution to get your life back.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7704648}"

I've lurked here for around 1.5 years and I'd like to share my experience, which is probably going to seem like nothing compared to the hell others are going through. I've used high quality outdoor MJ (flowers only) in a bong for around 4 years daily. I only ever smoke at night, generally after 9 pm with the goal of sleeping before 12 pm. The amount that I would need to smoke to feel a strong high has always been tiny, an 1/8th (around $70) would generally last me around 2 months. Nevertheless, every night I would habitually use because it increased the fun factor of literally every activity before sleep, and completely knock me out afterwards. Since I first smoked 10+ years ago, I had always known I was very sensitive to MJ compared to others and the usual amount has always felt potent enough.

I have decided to quit as I have been experiencing right sided, chronic abdominal pain for around a year. I often spend hours on the toilet trying to take a dump, and when I do, it looks relatively normal. I've spent thousands on specialists, had all types of scans performed and there is no abnormalities to see whatsoever. This pain usually subsides after MJ, allowing me to sleep uninterrupted but increasing my dependence on it.

I've gone cold turkey and I'm on day 14. I've experienced cold sweats, extreme lethargy in the mornings and vivid but positive dreams (sleeping 7 hours which is good) which seem like common withdrawal symptoms. The abdominal pain appears to be reducing and is improved even more by very hot showers. I've read about CHS, and I wonder if MJ has produced some kind of disruption in my guts rather than the upper GI. To date, nothing has reduced the pain as much as quitting. 

Has anyone had similar gut pain that was resolved by quitting? I'm going to give it another month and see what happens. I really enjoy MJ, but if it has been the cause of this pain all along it isn't worth it to me. My general attitude has improved alot this second week, I am much more confident and motivated compared to when I was smoking making me think there are probably alot of psychological effects I haven't even noticed before.

It was pretty bad, so I decided to take some non-prescription sleep aid, which worked and I got some sleep.

I've been smoking weed on a daily basis for about 4 years.
At first I started smoking every night because I couldn't fall asleep and also to numb down my depression.
A couple of years later I started smoking during the day, I'd get a lot of anxiety in the morning and it came with horrible ibs symptoms, the cannabis made it all go away for a couple of hours.

Week flew by, then months then years, didn't even notice. I sometimes think of weed as a way to fast forward in time (ever seen the movie click?)

The more I smoked the more I couldn't get by without it, everything feels boring and lame sober now (something I hope would change after a few weeks sober). 

I'm a CS student (first year) and weed makes me extremely lazy and unproductive, missed A LOT of classes. kept telling myself tomorrow I'll do better and just smoked the entire day. Then a couple of months ago I stopped smoking during the day and started studying. now I'm all cought up on my classes (mostly).

I still smoke every night to numb down the depression. It's very difficult to stop. 
Every night I feel overwhelmed with despair, loneliness and just darkness. Weed usually makes it all go away (for the most part)
Going without it completely is scary.

I've been dealing with depression for about a decade now. I think that since I started smoking I feel it a lot more (when I'm not high) or at lease I feel it stronger and just worst.
I don't remember anymore what it was like before. What it was like to be happy, to be able to enjoy life.
The thing is, I used to be the most positive kid, I saw life as a fricking miracle and loved it. Now it feels more like a curse.

In 2019 I lost my cross country/track scholarship in my senior year due to multiple failed drug tests. I dropped out of college and got stuck in a rut. I wanted to be a teacher, but my ambitions slowly withered away. The last year I’ve been working for doordash and spending most of my money on weed. I’m 24 with only $100 to my name at the moment. I’m not having fun anymore, this wasn’t supposed to be my life. I’m fortunate to have parents who would never let me end up on the street. 

I smoked everyday, and made sure to keep myself high at all times. I haven’t seen a doctor but i think i may be in the early stages of CHS, and even if I’m not the thought of developing that awful illness terrifies me. I would wake up every morning to minor nausea and anxiety, but the smoke always seemed to make that go away. However in the last few months, the weed has exacerbated my symptoms, and for the past two weeks my appetite has been shit. I don’t have hypochondriac tendencies, so when i feel bad i know something is actually wrong with my body. I decided it’s time to quit. The thought of quitting forever terrifies me right now. I hope one day to not even think about weed. The withdrawals seem manageable luckily, however I keep thinking about all the fun times I had while smoking, that’s the hardest part for me. It’s like saying goodbye to a longtime friend. 

I’m the only one in my family that smoked weed. My dad, a LEO, never supported my habit, my mom just like a lot of people who thought weed was relatively harmless. I should’ve listened to my dad, he’s seen the worst of the worst when it comes to substance abuse. Today I sat both of my parents down and told them how I was feeling and asked them for help. Then we spent the day together and then my dad helped me apply to a couple universities so I can finish my degree and become the person I want to be. I hadn’t hung out with my parents like that in years, so much time wasted. Tomorrow I will start running again, I haven’t had any real exercise since I lost my scholarship, so it will be tough but I miss the healthy-smart-overachiever that I used to be. I used to run a 4:25 mile for Pete’s sake and now I get winded walking up stairs. 

Anyways the purpose of this post was to make my promise public. I promise to better myself, I promise to graduate college and live my dream, I promise to stop ignoring my family in favor of a bong, I promise to be someone my nephew would be proud to call his uncle, I promise to become me again.",258,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.755058}"

I quit smoking daily on March 31, I went the entire month of April without smoking at all. I kept getting terrible headaches. 
For the month of May, I limited my intake to not more than once a day, and no more than 4 times a week. 

Most of the time I would only choose to smoke when I got these terrible headaches. 

I have now decided that I want to actually quit. It has only been 2 days, but I am getting these headaches that last ALL DAY LONG and they are extremely painful- almost debilitating. When i’m in this much pain it makes me want to smoke just to feel better. I don’t even enjoy smoking anymore, I just want to feel better. 

What can I do to get rid of these headaches??? Or distract myself from them? 

Not sure what a migraine is but these are intense splitting headaches that last from early morning to almost right up until I go to bed. 
It hurts really bad in my temples and behind my eyeballs. I have been rubbing my temples and using ice packs but I can’t be putting ice on my head 5 times a day while i am working. 
 

It makes me want to smoke, even though I really don’t want too. Please help 

also I do not take asprin or any of those kinds of meds. 

I had COVID in december and lost my taste and smell, I have not gotten it back yet and was recommended to quit smoking to help it come back. After the month of not smoking it returned slightly and I thought what is the harm in smoking just a couple times a week? Well I have not had any more progress in returning my taste and smell, and I enjoyed how i felt being sober much more then when I am high or a morning after. I do not want to continue to smoke any longer, I want to quit for good.

Not addiction in the traditional sense where my life is crumbing, but a dependency that I have not been able to abstain from. Maybe that is addiction to? 

My brother-in-law was a heroine and pill addict. His life totally collapsed and he OD’d a few years back. Luckily they were able to save him, he left the state for rehab and detox and has been sober since. So I always saw his experience and thought to myself, “that’s addiction, I just like smoking weed and it helps me sleep”. I didn’t smoke weed at all until 2017. I was 28 and I had just gotten out of the Air Force. Figured I’d try it. Quickly became my favorite thing to do. And the best part? I could actually sleep. I have always had issues with sleeping, but weed seemed to help….at first. 

Fast forward to 2021, I moved to Oregon back in 2018 (not for weed, but for a job) and I live close to a lot of dispensaries. I discovered the vape carts and I have been using them daily (almost always only in the evenings) ever since. I had the eye drops and the vape was mostly odorless, so my wife had no idea. I wasn’t trying to hide it, she knew it helped me sleep - but I didn’t tell her how much or how often I was using it.

Tried to quit a few times for employment drug tests, but after 2 nights of bad sleep, I went right back. Just kept telling myself, maybe I just like weed right? I mean hell, it’s Oregon - everyone is smoking. But I never felt rested…ever. And I felt like my anxiety was getting much worse and depression too. When we had our son, I abstained for almost 2 weeks and I started feeling so much better. Better rested, happier, and (maybe this is just me) but I finally felt sharp and not like I was losing my damn mind. But I went right back to it. “For sleep”…such denial. 

I fucking hate it now. I resent it. I resent needing a substance to perform basic human functions. And I have now given it up for good (well for 2 days so far). I have a great chance at an amazing job that requires a drug test. I have about a month. And the best part, the job will require moving to a stare where it is still illegal. Which is much needed.

27 months weed-free here. I've posted a number of times over the last couple of years about PAWS and my experiences, and people still randomly reach out to me about it. One of my missions in life is to *always* be there as best I can for someone else going through PAWS, and to give fellow PAWS sufferers hope! So here is an update and some HOPE and TRUTH about this thing you are going through.

Without going back over my whole timeline (you can see my previous posts), I'll give you a real short synopsis and a snapshot of where I am today.

**Months 0-3:** Panic attacks caused me to quit weed. I had smoked for 12 years cumulatively, with an almost 3 year break in between. The first few months were the worst. Physical symptoms, PROFOUND daily anxiety, agoraphobia, and depressive spells I never experienced before, ever. It was very much survival mode day-to-day.

**Months 3-6:** Incremental improvements, with good days sprinkled in but still more bad days than good. But there was some hope.

**Months 6-12:** Continued PAWS, but better day-to-day moods and function. Symptoms were 80% anxiety with about 20% depressive spells. The depression I experienced was very existential and despairing, and completely unwanted. I knew on some level it was chemical, but also spiritual, if you believe in that. I do. It came in waves.

**Months 12-18:** Marked improvements with a trend towards the ""normal"" mind again. Stressful events would set me off, sometimes for weeks. But my baseline was steadily improving.

**Months 18-27 (now):** I would say right after 18 months is when PAWS seemed to finally dissolve and my new baseline was the ""normal mind"". The mind I had before, changed in some ways, but mostly healthy. Anxiety is very episodic and probably on par with my pre-weed baseline. Depressive spells do occur, and I think this is where healing is still taking place. When they do, they make sense, retrospectively. I went through a very stressful 6 months after the birth of our first child with hospitals and health issues. Anyone would have had difficulties. I think after PAWS, when you feel depression, it feels like ""PAWS depression"" if that makes sense. I cant say for certain when this goes away, but I have full confidence it does, just like everything else with this weird, unwanted, and at times harrowing syndrome!!

Everyone, at some points in their life, experiences anxiety and depression. That doesn't always equal ""PAWS"". But sometimes you might get the feelings mixed up. Just keep that in mind.

 I got back on the leaves train about three weeks ago and had a couple of attempts. Both times I kept giving in and pinching weed from my flatmate.

Anyway, I've been weed free again for just under 4 days. 3 Days and 21 hours. First couple of days I felt great actually, clear headed and happy, but some pretty brutal insomnia. 

However, the last couple of days I've been pretty anxious. I find myself getting very worked up and into a panicky state over nothing. I punched my desk a few times earlier over silly little annoyances. I was an idiot and picked up tons of extra freelance work this week despite knowing I was staying off of weed, and it's all a bit too much to handle. Thankfully as I write this one of my big meetings cancelled on me, so that's actually a bit of a relief. 

Something that really scares me is that I don't think I can handle emotions very well at all. I've noticed that whether I felt ecstatically happy or miserably sad, I used to react by smoking a lot of weed and then binging over dopamine-based habits such as food, video games, sleep and masturbation. I find this very interesting - it's not like it was just an escape from bad things, but it was a reaction to very positive news, promotions, good grades, stuff like that too. 

A couple of years ago I quit for 7 months, by far my record. Even then after 7 months, I would still get like this. Panicky, and like I just wanted to cry all the time over nothing. I'd get deeply nostalgic about my childhood and cry thinking about my family. I'd want to call them up every day - it's almost as if I started smoking at 16, blocked all my emotions and emotional development for 10 years, and now I'm just a 16 year old boy again, wishing he was with his Mum and Dad. Tearing up just writing this. 

But yeh, I can feel all of those feelings coming back. I keep worrying that I've really fucked my brain, that i'll be like this forever. However, I think it's more likely that I wasn't replacing my habits well enough. I'm into rock climbing these days and previously I never did any exercise, so hopefully that will help. 

Also, I tried fasting for the first time on day 2. I don't know what made me do that but it was actually a very enjoyable experience. It complimented the sober feeling quite nicely and I felt like it helped some how. 

Well, that's it. There isn't really much point to this other than that I just wanted to write my thoughts, doesn't matter if anyone reads it. I also just want to say a big thank you to everyone and the creators of this community. I often don't feel like i can speak to my friends and family about this stuff (i'm sure I could, but I don't feel comfortable doing it). So yeh it's really nice to have a place to just write stuff like this.

Today’s my 25th birthday and my gift to myself is to quit weed... FOREVER.

I’ve heard somewhere here on Reddit after someone turns 25 it’s hard to change certain habits that are engrained- maybe it’s not totally accurate but I used that as some momentum.

My last break was Feb 2020-May 2020 and even before I took my first hit I was like “ugh I know if I hit this I will literally not be able to maintain a healthy relationship with it... one time will lead to once a week then everyday then multiple times a week... self fulfilling prophecy really.. 

So fast forward may2020- about 10 days ago I’ve been smoking every day multiple times a day... eating pizza ice cream cookies, staying in bed scrolling through social media and something just clicked. After months of reading through leaves and popping into the discord every now and then hearing everyone’s stories... it’s finally time. So 11 days clean and I can give myself the best birthday present of no more weed!!! 

**Benefits of not smoking so far**

- **better sleep** : Waking up feeling refreshed, falling asleep quicker without overthinking in my mind, no more tossing and turning in the middle of the night  or smacking my bfs head o.o” (sorry babe) 

- **more energy at the gym**: before I would workout but never push myself to the point of fatigue, now I can and it feels BOSS!!!!

- *no more shit food cravings* haven’t had the desire to eat ice cream or cookies on a daily basis... and when I do I can have a spoonful and be happy. 

- *emotion regulation* : I use to get annoyed at my mom just starting conversations about my life or when she asked me to do dishes/clean but now I just happily listen without getting irritated and just clean without even having to be asked.
(Bonus: I’ve had many random spurts of HAPPY cries just appreciating life & nature so HELL YEAH)

- *deeper connection with my dog* I’ve been more attentive to his needs and feelings + taking him out on runs regularly! 


There’s more but I can’t think of them now.

Fuck fuck fuck fuck weed.

But also thank you for teaching me these lessons. 

From a 10 year pot smoker, if I can do it so can you. I will refer to this post if I ever have any doubts or cravings but honestly I haven’t really even been craving it. Life is awesome peace love and kittys.

You know the type- not the life of the party, but always a familiar face. You'd hold down the fort and keep things mellow and fun. Break up fights when you need to, and listen to people when they have something to get off their chest.

Don't get me wrong, I love keeping the peace. But I didn't actually realise how much I instinctively associate kickbacks with being high.

Since deciding to go sober a few months back, I've found that I'm fine when I'm alone. It's at parties (or should I say lively get-togethers, I'm not the partying age anymore) where I feel like there's an established role that I automatically have to play.

I've relapsed twice since, and not even because I was offered. I sought it out. I'm one of the people who'd rally the crew up for a sesh- and I found myself doing it twice. I haven't talked to any of my friends about deciding to go sober (apart from my best friend who lives overseas), so none of my stoner friends know. I also know that when you decide to go sober, it might be a sensitive topic for others who are still battling denial.

I don't have social anxiety, but if I'm being honest having the stoner-kid vibe made me feel like I had ""cool points"".

Would love to know how you guys have gotten/are getting  over it. Maybe hear some anecdotes or tips on what to do in the moment. I know that some of my friends also use weed as a crutch, and instead of enabling them I want us to get better together.

I’m only 24 but it has totally robbed me of any motivation to go out into the world and better myself. My dream is to be a performing musical artist but I have bad social anxiety, and when I’m high there’s nothing more terrifying than meeting new people or presenting myself and my art. So I don’t. I have no dating life and feel like a stranger in my own apartment because I’ve isolated myself so much from my roommates due to depression and always being high.

Today is the day I’m taking the active step to better my life. Like many people I’ve had dozens of Day 1s, but it’s been awhile since I tried. Lately I haven’t even taken the possibility seriously that I have the potential to quit anymore. That’s how dependent I have become.

One big problem for me is “get rid of the stash” doesn’t work. I live in a city where it’s legal and there are many dispensaries in close distance. I’ve probably thrown out hundreds of dollars of weed and pipes and little bongs in attempts to quit, only to buy more the very next day. Sometimes just a few hours later. I’m lucky enough to be in a good financial situation, which can also be a curse because I can’t convince myself I don’t have the cash to buy just a little more.

Reading this forum though, has been such a blessing. I see all the people in my exact situation and people who have been here for a decade longer than me. I really admire your strength and vulnerability even if you’ve just made it to Day 2. Day 2 is an accomplishment I haven’t claimed in years.

They believe they cannot be happy on their own so they look for something, alcohol or drugs or addictive tendencies, to fill that need.""

And it just hit me: they *believe* that. But it doesn't make it true (although I think it does make it a self fulfilling prophecy). I realised that actually, I dont need anything external to make me happy. Using weed or alcohol or whatever was a product of believing that I was incomplete, that something was missing and those substances created the illusion that they were completing me, even temporarily. But they werent. It was a lie, told to myself from my subconscious, from the subtle, unspoken things parents and friends and media taught me. But I have the power to rewrite that for myself.

Not even Pepto or Tums.(figured I would give them a shot…. To no avail) I’ve been throwing up most of the day, still have nausea, no appetite, I’m WIDE AWAKE, and I feel like absolute shit.

I thought I could smoke and work, somehow maintaining a life in between. I'm now 23.

On the side, I'd have spare time and spend as much of it either learning or producing films. I managed to premier my first movie and ended up getting my first career building job as a props master for a true-crime series -- but I was unbelievably high at my own premier... with the cast, my family, and friends around. I wasn't really mentally ""present"". I was watching, like a spectator.

I eventually joined the local union, got real lucky. 

Got to work on hallmarks, grunt work, very long days, hot sun and not enough water. Went home, had enough energy to smoke. It wore my body down, my mind went numb, then it just went... blank. And stayed blank.

I eventually landed on a trio of ever growing, large scale out of province, hollywood productions -- but my addiction was climbing up with me, faster than I imagined, robbing me of my pay cheques, and especially my opportunities to network with anyone worthwhile on set.

Then I was about to produce a musical series... 7 music videos in 10 days. I was high at the end of every night, as well as drinking. My emotional stability was at its worst, some bad luck lead to me feeling targeted -- cursing the production, hating my work ethic. I hated myself.

We survived the production, overcame any concerns and we're now in post production. I got a new job to pay off the bills, but I realized I couldn't think anymore... I was at a desk job because I stopped networking... I hated the very passion that lead me to find early success and financial freedom... for a time.

I had to quit. I realized it was ruining me, and I had thrown all my friends away in hopes to climb higher on the food chain. Whatever friendships that were left, I must've burnt during that musical production. I was a real piece of shit, I wasn't myself... I needed help.

I found this page shortly after my musical shoot, and over the span of a month I made the decision to fight back. I collected my black ""mood box"", full of old blunts, rolls, lighters, and whatever weed I had left and found a secret spot to burn it. 

I destroyed my pipe, made sure nothing survived the fire, and watched it fade away.

I'm now on day 6. My body aches, my mind thumps with frustration, my stomach is confused as to why it's not constantly eating bullshit.

I reached out to some producers and now we're trying to get a feature film written, but its all on me to get the first few steps going. 

I only managed to do this because I had to quit. If I was ever going to accomplish this dream, I had to quit.

I honestly thought I’d stop coughing up black stuff by now. From what I’ve read, the cilia in our lungs don’t become paralyzed from weed, like nicotine. That’s why we cough up so much shit.

About a week into quit my brother had a full blown panic attack which sent me into a panic attack. After this panic my anxiety has been EXTREMELY heightened like never before. Then the derealization hit about 3 days after the panic attack. I was so confused, disoriented, anxious and depressed. I couldn’t think straight, everything looked different or fake. I thought maybe it was a bad case of withdrawal and tried smoking again but it only seemed to make everything worse. I felt trapped and hopeless to not have weed as an escape anymore.

 After dredging through two weeks of what I can describe as hell I was suicidal and went into into a hospital trying to explain this “off” dissociated feeling along with crazy anxiety and depression. They pinkslipped me into the psych ward for a week which was just another week of medicated hell. When I was let out I was happy to be out and I was fine for about a week, little anxiety, no depression but still this “off” feeling I just didn’t seem to mind it anymore. 

I started toking again because I felt fine-ish, the weed felt good to smoke not bringing on any anxiety. After about a week or two of smoking it started to turn on me again, giving me anxiety when I would smoke. I would get super concerned about this off feeling and my mental health in general. It seemed that weed no longer calmed me down but rather heightened the emotional state that I’m in before I smoke. 

By this time it was probably early may I was still smoking because it felt somewhat better feeling off while high than feeling off while sober if that makes sense. Not much has changed since then the anxiety is almost constant and the depression comes along when I’m anxious. I get a couple days almost free of anxiety sometimes but the derealization is 100% constant the intensity is up and down though. I’ve been trying to convince myself it’s just the brain fog from weed but I’ve quit for probation before and the brain fog felt different than this off feeling. I get these sensations sometimes where I feel that what ever is happening around me at the time couldn’t be real but I KNOW that it is and it’s extremely distressing. I get sketched out about weird coincidences that I seem to make up in my head. My whole visual field feels a little different but I can’t describe how. I feel impaired while driving even when I’m sober. 

It’s like a derealization switch just flipped on after a couple days of bad anxiety with withdrawal symptoms and now I can’t turn it off. I’m starting to accept I need to give up the bud if I want to start feeling normal again but my anxiety gives me this ruminating thought that I’m stuck like this. It’s June 2nd today, last night I skipped my before bed smoke sesh and haven’t smoked today. Trying to keep June 2nd as my sobriety date and hoping this feeling starts to fade away. 

After searching “derealization” in the r/leaves search bar I realized this is not all that uncommon. I guess my intention of posting this is looking for tips from those of you who have dealt with DP/DR related to weed. Sorry for this post being long and all over the place I can’t ever think straight and it’s hard to remember anything ever since the DR. Also wanted to add that my brothers panic attack was the extent of his problems quitting no other stuff like me

Now I’ve been sober since April 7 and not going back to those old ways. 

The biggest lesson I’ve learned: Removing the triggers from my life or dealing with them head on is the only way to not go back to weed to just mask them. Weed did an AMAZING job at masking them.

Just like any other student who went to the us to pursue his degree and someone who always had the green light in his eyes to try out the American bud and all since I was an occasional smoker based in India and all we used to get here was low shelf leaves, not even bud! And that always got me interested in maybe smoking that and see what it had to offer! My first year at college flew so quick I didn’t even had any idea of what happened! Ppl used to come over to my apartment to chill and play fifa maybe but all that was to have a smoke sesh before proceeded by any other forms of activity. This legit took me to taking bowls literally before doing anything , maybe going to bed, studying, playing sports or maybe even gym! There was no actual activity which wasn’t done by me when I wasn’t high. Although, getting home in the break was low-key a t-break for me as I used to go over an ounce in maybe 3-4 days to the max and that too hotboxing a car for merely 5 hours sitting at the same spot. After getting home I used to smoke up occasionally and it was going smooth. During the last few months, I’ve ended up discovering a plug for TOP shelf bud which we get in the states but not in india and was maybe a jackpot for me!!! I used to pick up a qrtr bag in a week when I was home and again the smokers lifestyle was back? I was used to the chills and stuff as whenever I used to be back home, I didn’t smoke up for a day or 2 which was really hard as it legit fucked my sleep cycle... 

It’s just now I feel it’s time for me to atleast try stopping as I’m at that point in my life where I can’t risk it towards any direction but rather make it myself. Earlier, the knowledge I used to give myself was that weed is just a lifestyle and nothing else. One cannot be addicted to smoking weed. I still say that, but it certainly depends on our will power and the determination to stop it. 


Ever since I was a kid I was a fan of releasing smoke from my mouth whether it may be a hookah or a disposable nic pen!!! I used to have something or the other in my hands idk why just cuz it seemed cool? Now when I look back I feel disgusted on myself but still I’m somewhere happy as I took this step which could’ve been taken more time to be implemented!!!

I’m happy for this journey to completely turn into a sober person as I forgot what being sober feels like!


Also, I don’t drink alcohol at all!!

Over two years I have quit a dozen times, going as long as 4 months just to get back in the habit. After 9 months , the message is clear. A life **free** of weed is a life better lived. 

There is no word I can substitute for *freedom*. The smoke clouds make it hard to see just how much this plant can hold you down.

*Freedom* to plan my day however I want. Do whatever I want, whenever I want. No longer structuring my day around when I can use. Drive and get some food at 9pm. Do groceries at any time of day. Play a sport whenever I feel. 

*Freedom* to set goals and actually achieve them. To practice new things I would have never tried if I felt **comfortable** .

*Freedom* to RETAIN information . To learn about complicated subjects that require concentration, news topics, watch a movie and actually remember wtf it was that happened. 

Lessons learned:

*  I would have never achieved this without each prior sober streak slowly showing me the *what could be* of being sober. The important thing is not how long you can make it, but that you are trying. If you are thinking of quitting, just do it. Even if you only make it 24 hours or a few days, you have challenged yourself and learned something.

*  Because of how hard quitting was, I used to think ""there's no way I can make it to a year"" . I thought that ""willpower"" was something that you had a finite amount of . That it would run out after so many days. In practice, the opposite is true. Because of the changes in my life, my resolve and desire to not smoke is stronger than ever. It all starts with those first difficult steps.

*  Don't forget why you quit. My other relapses were always triggered ~3 months in, when I would start to physically feel great. I would stop checking leaves, stop reminding myself that I am sober for a reason, and eventually would get that creeping desire to smoke. I would be a fool to not think that my current habit of reminding myself every day that **I don't smoke anymore** and checking leaves hasn't helped me along.

* Tell someone. If you live with someone (I am married) there is no one more important (or more invested) in your sobriety than this person. Tell them how you feel. Tell them when you have bad days. Tell them when you feel urges. You will be surprised how much it helps dissolve these things when you put it out there.

*  My social skills/relationships have increased by an indescribable amount. I used to think I was ""the same"" or ""did fine"" in social situations. I was not. Friends notice. Loved ones notice. And they would love to have you back.

*  I have some scary medical issues that leave alot to the unknown in the next few years. My ability to deal with this, and understand that **right now I feel great** and live life is drastically improved. 

And finally, the goal is not simply to *quit smoking* . It is to fill your life with things that bring you happiness that aren't weed. People, hobbies, games, whatever. There wasn't room for much when I was high 24/7. Now my day surrounds exercise, playing guitar, my family, video games with friends, making new friends etc. . Any one of these would have felt like a DAY LONG commitment before.

2021-06-01 22:03:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nqaowf/day_4_check_in_post/,Day 4 check in post.,"It’s been four days since I quit and it’s honestly a lot easier than it was in the past. I think I just knew it was time, and I told my dealers to blacklist me for a month. Knowing smoking isn’t an option has made it a lot less difficult.

So far sleep has been the hardest thing. It takes me forever to get to sleep, but I know that’s temporary, and luckily I’ve been able to get enough over the past few days.

Trigger wise the worst thing has been smelling it from the neighbors, or being bored with nothing to do. I haven’t quite got the energy/motivation to do a bunch of stuff yet, and I’m torn between forcing myself to and just letting myself relax. I’ve always had a really hard time relaxing, if I’m not being productive I think I’m wasting time, and weed helped alleviate the guilt I associated with doing nothing. Maybe I just need to do whatever I want for a little while and remind myself that that’s ok.

I notice I’ve been smoking more cigarettes at home, maybe to cope with not having anything else to smoke. Sitting outside and taking a drag every now and then seems like a harder habit to break than the weed itself.

After 7 years of heavy use every single day, I finally made the decision to quit. I fancied myself as a “functioning” stoner throughout the years. With a bachelors and well established career, weed got me through a lot of days when the pressure was too much. What started as an end of the week ritual quickly formed into a daily need. There was no boundaries with my use; smoked when I woke up, on the way to work, at work, days off, hanging out w/friends, being around family, ect. There was nothing a fat rip couldn’t fix. But as growth and responsibilities started to mount, weed began to work against me. I started losing quality in my work, the only personality my friends knew involved me being stoned, my ability to think rationally went out the window at times, and my emotions started to run my life. I had to finally admit to myself that using wasn’t benefiting me anymore. In fact, using made everything in my life stagnant.

I just ordered some exercise equipment off amazon so as soon as that comes in I'll try and replace the popper habit with a healthier work out habit and see how quitting goes this time. Our brother in law quit the poppers so now there's no where to sneak to smoke weed which should help..

What started as a tolerance break has quickly become a newfound passion for life, and I just wanted to thank this message board for the daily inspiration (and reality checks- this sh** ain’t easy).

I always thought smoking put me in “the ideal headspace” to make the most of every moment in life (before parties, before meals, before dates, before movies, etc etc). Like John Stewart’s character in Half Baked, everything was a little better....”on weed, man!” 

I can now clearly see that it actively took me ~out~ of all of those moments. And now being forced to sit with all my feelings and emotions- those good and those bad- feels so much better than my previous cop out- hitting the bowl to numb it all.

I would wake up mentally underwater, and smoke till I was treading water through the day. Maintaining some sense of hazy buoyancy through life. Hell, I didn’t even know what being “high” was anymore. High was my default.

Anyways, looking forward to continuing my journey and completely altering my relationship with weed.  For those struggling on day 1 or day 1,000- just keep reminding yourself of the ‘why’. Why you don’t like who you are high. Why you feel like shit after long benders of smoking.

I am not sure if it is the weed or maybe I have depression but i would love to see who i can become without weed. 

What got me to this point was these psg few months I have just been super depressed and angry at myself and i am just tired of it. I want to feel good about life again and have control over my mind.

I mean, I still talk to my friends about smoking weed and what kind of product they picked up etc. because at the end of the day, I feel like weed is not a bad drug. A couple tokes a few times a week after you get your shit done shouldn’t be a problem. I think it’s when you start obsessing over it is when altering your mind starts to become bigger than life itself. 

I won’t go into too much of my story today. Just know that I have failed, over and over and over again. Way too many times to count. I am writing this now because my recent failure has left me feeling defeated. 

Weed is insidious because when you go back to smoking, you think, “hey, maybe it wasn’t all that bad. Perhaps I just need to change my mindset about it.” This was me. So, I began meditating like crazy and my mental issues did ease up a bit. So a few months later pass and as I look back I think wow not much in my life has changed. But the time flew by! 

I start to think about what I’ve done in these past few months. Watch TV shows, work on some music, doubt myself, get caught up in what others think about me etc. So, haven’t done shit huh? 

In February of this year, I started going back to school. I wasn’t smoking at the time I signed up. I went from being overly excited and motivated to start to basically dropping out and missing classes. The more I smoked, the less I wanted to do shit. It’s insidious because it creeps up on you. 

You tell yourself that maybe it’s not the week, and perhaps it’s alcohol or some other drugs that you are doing. But the weed? No, never! 

The thing is, weed isn’t even that bad compared to alcohol. I think the problem is that people who want to stop smoking weed want something more out of life. We’ve realized that we can’t get there with weed and that sucks because weed is seen as such a harmless drug to other people. 

So yeah, here’s my day one. I’m not fearful. I’m just kinda fed up with it already and ready to move on. But I’ve said this before so i don’t even know anymore. 

The difference in this streak tho is that I’m not going to wait until the weed leaves my system or until I feel better. I’m not going to waste more days watching Netflix. I’m just going to go after shit.

I guess this post is going to fit into a grey area on this sub.

I've always had generally bad sleep since puberty, and weed has been the biggest help. I don't relate strongly to what others say about sleep quality and vivid dreams when I smoke or abstain. I generally wake up feeling well rested after having an evening joint - I only wake up groggy when I really tuck in the day before, and tbh that's asking for it.

My doc has put me on a natural supplement to help me sleep, and it sucks. I don't know if it's weed withdrawal, just general system upheaval, or if it's not the right thing for me, but I wake up in a worse state than no-weed-sleeplessness leaves me. Groggy, vacant, and generally miffed.

I've been depressed for a long time, and the line between my own head and weeds effect is very blurry. A big reason for stopping now is to see where I'm at without any. That and it's been making me dumb, and unmotivated!   
Anyway, I guess I need to see how I move forward without the hindrance.

Since I've been a chronic smoker, the longest 'break' was about 3 months, and I can't say it had a particularly positive effect. I slept like crap, and was generally down to the point that it caused marital problems - it ended with me just needing some decent rest. That was about 2 years ago, and I've been a pretty regular smoker since then.

I guess I'd like to know if anybody else feels the way I do, and to get some thoughts from people going through the big quit as well.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7424424}"

The first week has been horrible- anxiety unbearable, multiple panic attacks a day, insomnia, upset stomach, and overall just not feeling like myself and wondering if I’ll ever feel normal again. But I think it’s finally getting better. I had my first full night of sleep last night. 
The only thing that helped me was this subreddit. It made me feel like I was normal and helped me see a light at the end of the tunnel. I’m looking forward to fully feeling like myself again. I’ve realized I can enjoy things like reading or going for walks without needing to smoke beforehand. Anxiety is still here, but it’s nowhere near as bad as it was those first couple of days. Emotions are still up and down- I woke up and pretty much immediately started crying today. But I’m so proud of myself for completing the first week, I truly thought I was going to be a smoker for life. After a lot of self reflection, I realized I was using smoking to mask/cope with anxiety/depression. Even though sometimes it feels like I’m dying, I’d rather feel all these feelings than have to numb myself with a substance. I also quit drinking and nicotine this week (triple whammy!!).
So thank you to everyone on this subreddit who has been vulnerable and opened up about their experiences. I’m still not there yet, but each day is a little better, and I know this is the best thing  can do for myself.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.79987335}"

I quit in Nov last year, then relapsed for 7 days in late Feb, but cut that shit out again and haven't looked back. I would've been high for 95% of my life, but in 2021 I've only been high for less than 5% of the year, and 0% of the last 90 days.  


When I share the good news with my friends and family (almost all of them smoke or have alcohol addictions) they don't seem to give a shit at all, just change the subject or crack jokes about it. I've given up on hoping to hear ""Congratulations"" or ""I'm happy for you"" and just take their silence as a sign that I'm definitely doing the right thing. Instead of getting down about it, I'm seeing this as a red flag that these people don't care about me and so I've been going out on dates, socialising with friends who don't smoke and see it as part of building a whole new life.  


Just wanted to share the news with some people who might give a shit and if you're experiencing a similar lack of support from your inner circle, maybe find yourself a new inner circle that cares about your success and wellbeing.

I'm really nervous for today. I told myself yesterday I'd wait until I have 7 complete days of no alcohol before I quit weed but I was getting kind of tired of it and I wanted a clean date of June 1st. I want myself and my life back. I'm tired of the brain fog and I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I feel exhausted and beat up from being high and drunk all the time. 

I hope I make it this time. My life depends on it. Day 1, here we gooo!

I didnt smoke for a long time compared to some others but that was my first time ever consistently smoking a substance. Now I just feel scared and anxious as I think I've fucked myself up. Before the three months of smoking I did have mental health problems (like emotional dysregulation and mild anxiety but nothing like how im feeling now)

So I got super honest with people about how I felt heavily addicted to weed and that was my biggest help, I told my doctor everything about how I wanted to quit but felt a strong force that I couldn’t do it on my own like I was controlled in my head, she helped me with a cessation medication that’s supposed to help intense cravings and since I have taken it I feel like a new person now ready to quit weed for good and see how depressed it had made me.
